    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to use the novel SV2a-PET ligand, [F-18]SDM-8 to assess synaptic&#xD;
      density in progressive MS (including primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS) and&#xD;
      secondary progressive multiple sclerosis (SPMS)) as compared to relapsing-remitting multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (RRMS) patients and healthy controls, given its improved imaging characteristics&#xD;
      and potential for large scale applicability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To compare the cortical and subcortical grey matter synaptic density in progressive MS&#xD;
      patients, patients with relapsing-remitting MS, and healthy subjects, using a novel [F-18]&#xD;
      labeled synaptic density PET ligand, [F-18]SDM8, also known as [F-18]SynvesT-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare the relationship of synaptic density PET and standard 3T MRI measures&#xD;
      including global and regional brain atrophy and lesion load with clinical measures of&#xD;
      physical disability, cognitive impairment, fatigue and depression in MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To assess the relationship of synaptic density PET with serum neurofilament light&#xD;
      chain (NfL) and with serum measurements of inflammatory markers, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, MCP-1&#xD;
      (Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1) and MIF-1 (Macrophage Migration Inhibitory Factor-1).&#xD;

      I. Subject Selection Subjects will be recruited at the Partners MS Center, 60 Fenwood Road,&#xD;
      Boston, MA during routine clinical appointments by their physician or one of the other&#xD;
      co-investigators listed on the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Study Procedures Subjects will be required to come for 3 visits for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the first visit, subjects will be administered the screening questionnaire (if that&#xD;
      has not already been done over telephone). Subjects will review and eventually sign the&#xD;
      consent form. They will be administered standardized questionnaires for cognitive testing&#xD;
      and/or other co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo at least one visit for PET scan. During the PET scan visits, all&#xD;
      women subjects of child bearing age will undergo a stat quantitative serum hCG pregnancy test&#xD;
      and only women with a negative test will undergo the radiopharmaceutical injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET imaging procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      PET scanning session will be conducted at MGH Gordon Center PET scanning facility, 55 Fruit&#xD;
      Street, Boston, MA. For PET scanning, an intra-arterial catheter will be inserted into the&#xD;
      [F-18] SynVest-1 for metabolite blood sampling by a trained anesthesiologist. Allen's test&#xD;
      will be performed prior to insertion of the intra-arterial catheter. In the event that an&#xD;
      arterial line cannot be established to obtain metabolite samples, a venous line will be&#xD;
      placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, an intravenous (IV) catheter will be inserted into the radial antecubital or&#xD;
      other arm or hand vein for injection of tracer. Radiopharmaceutical will be injected as a&#xD;
      bolus (approximately 5mCi for [F-18]SynVest-1 followed by 5 mL of saline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole PET session will last up to 120 min. At the time of imaging, the subjects will be&#xD;
      positioned in the gantry of a PET camera. Head alignment will be made, relative to the&#xD;
      canthomeatal line, using projected laser lines whose positions are known with respect to the&#xD;
      slice positions of the scanner. A head support apparatus will be used to minimize head&#xD;
      motion. Brain PET data acquisition will begin at the moment of radiotracer injection. Images&#xD;
      will be acquired using a high-resolution PET/CT scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will undergo a 3T Brain MRI during an MRI visit that may precede or follow the&#xD;
      PET scan visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy screening prior to MRI:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will be queried about their pregnancy status, use of contraception and last&#xD;
      menstrual period. If they are reliably using contraception, can state the timing of their&#xD;
      last menstrual period, and do not believe they could be pregnant, the investigators will&#xD;
      proceed with the MRI scan without pregnancy testing. If they cannot do this, then they will&#xD;
      undergo a urine pregnancy test. If a woman is seeking pregnancy and not using contraception,&#xD;
      she will undergo a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI imaging procedures MRI scanning session will be performed at BWH MRI facility at 60&#xD;
      Fenwood Road, Boston, MA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several pulse sequences will be performed to image the brain. There will be no intravenous&#xD;
      contrast used for any of the MRIs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MRI scan session will take approximately 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected on all subjects during scanning sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During PET scanning, brain images will be acquired in 3-D mode, and dynamic acquisition scans&#xD;
      will continue for up to 120 minutes. A non-diagnostic CT scan will be performed for&#xD;
      attenuation correction of PET transmission data at the time of initiation of scanning. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected via an arterial line for radiotracer analysis via the cannula other&#xD;
      than the one used for radiotracer injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non Imaging Data&#xD;
&#xD;
      MS subjects Expanded Disability Severity Scale (EDSS) Timed 25-feet walk (T25W) Modified&#xD;
