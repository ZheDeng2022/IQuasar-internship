  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study assesses the effectiveness of Polyvalent Mechanical Bacterial Lysate&#xD;
      (PMBL-Ismigen) in reducing nasal methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) colony&#xD;
      growth in children with pollen allergic rhinitis (AR) aged 5 to 17. Half of the participants&#xD;
      received PMBL and the other half received a placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) is caused by the allergens of wind-pollinated plants, and in&#xD;
      Poland mainly by grass pollen allergens. During the grass pollen season, patients may suffer&#xD;
      from fatigue, weakness, lack of fitness, difficulty in sleeping and reduced performance at&#xD;
      school. In people allergic to the above-mentioned pollen, the disease significantly reduces&#xD;
      the quality of life and requires intensive treatment in the pollen period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRSA colonizing the nasal cavity has the ability to actively modulate the immune response in&#xD;
      children suffering from SAR. Many studies have shown a greater severity of AR symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with a MRSA-positive nasal swab compared to patients with normal nasal flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the high incidence of AR, the negative impact of the disease on the quality of life,&#xD;
      and incomplete effectiveness of previously available therapeutic methods, new methods of&#xD;
      treatment are being developed. Recent research highlights the immunoregulatory potential of&#xD;
      bacterial lysates, indicating the possibility of their future use in the prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of allergic diseases, including atopic dermatitis, AR, and asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above considerations, it can be hypothesized that bacterial lysates reduce the&#xD;
      severity of AR symptoms by eradicating MRSA from the nasal cavity. However, so far no&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study has been conducted to evaluate the effect&#xD;
      of bacterial lysates on nasal Staphylococcus aureus carriage in children with SAR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study was to evaluate nasal colonization by MRSA among children with SAR&#xD;
      and the effect of PMBL on the reduction of MRSA colony growth in these children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      70 children with SAR were enrolled to this study and were randomly assigned to the PMBL group&#xD;
      (n=35) and placebo group (n=35). Two visits took place as part of the study: at the beginning&#xD;
      of the grass pollen season and at the end of the season. The time frame of the grass pollen&#xD;
      season for south-eastern Poland was determined using the &quot;95%&quot; method on the basis of&#xD;
      measurements of grass pollen concentration in the atmospheric air, which were obtained from&#xD;
      the Environmental Allergy Research Centre in Warsaw. Nasal swabs for bacteriological cultures&#xD;
      were taken at each visit and were transferred to the hospital laboratory.&#xD;

    <description>At the randomization visit and end-of-study visit, a nasal swab was collected for bacteriological cultures and compared whether there was a change in the growth intensity of the Staphylococcus aureus colony between these two points.&#xD;
The collected material was placed in a test-tube with a transport medium and transferred to the laboratory of the University Children's Hospital in Lublin, where it was inoculated on appropriate media. Microbial growth was assessed by semi-quantitative method (+ scanty growth, ++ moderate growth, +++ large growth, ++++ abundant growth).</description>
