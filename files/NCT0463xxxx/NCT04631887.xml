    <textblock>
      The feasibility study for the delivery of the &quot;Doing What Matters in Times of Stress: An&#xD;
      Illustrated Guide&quot; will be carried out for Turkish and Syrian individuals with psychological&#xD;
      stress. This feasibility study's sample will be adult Turkish and the Syrian refugees. The&#xD;
      informed consent form and screening questionnaire of the feasibility study will be sent to&#xD;
      the participants who have given this approval and 128 (64 Turkish and 64 Syrian) participants&#xD;
      who meet the inclusion criteria will be included in the feasibility study. The psychological&#xD;
      problems will be measured twice, before and after the intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Studies about the impact of epidemics such as Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on the&#xD;
      psychological health of individuals show that psychological problems have been observed in&#xD;
      individuals who are affected by the epidemic. Today, studies on the effects of COVID-19 on&#xD;
      psychological health are also available in the literature, and the results of these studies&#xD;
      are in line with those of previous studies on epidemics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to deliver the &quot;Doing What Matters in Times of Stress: An&#xD;
      Illustrated Guide&quot; that is developed by the World Health Organization within Self Help Plus&#xD;
      (SH+) intervention to decrease their psychological problems for a feasibility study. The&#xD;
      feasibility study for the delivery of the SH+ book will be carried out and the psychological&#xD;
      problems of the participants will be measured twice, before and after the intervention to&#xD;
      evaluate the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most important contribution of the Project is conducting a feasibility study with the&#xD;
      &quot;Doing What Matters in Times of Stress: An Illustrated Guide&quot; which will be adapted to the&#xD;
      Turkish culture based on the determination of Turkey's current psychological status, provide&#xD;
      a form of intervention to the Turkish psychological intervention literature and to improve&#xD;
      the psychological status of the participants in this project.&#xD;
