    <textblock>
      The aim of the project is to show that gene expression levels change in at least one of the&#xD;
      GATA6 and T-box transcription factor 3 (TBX3) genes in indirect inguinal hernia sacs, thus&#xD;
      revealing that this pathway causes an error in the sac closure pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indirect inguinal hernia is an important condition for human health as it is common in the&#xD;
      community and can lead to life-threatening or permanent loss of function. In addition, since&#xD;
      the treatment is performed surgically, the follow-up and treatment process of the patients&#xD;
      should be managed carefully in terms of complications and costs. By explaining the mechanisms&#xD;
      of the occurrence of this disease, important steps will be taken in terms of both human&#xD;
      health and the development of science. Moreover, the data to be collected may open new&#xD;
      horizons in the treatment of inguinal hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 inguinal hernia patients those consecutively applied to Trakya University Medical Faculty&#xD;
      Department of Pediatric Surgery and 20 circumcision patients as control group will be&#xD;
      included in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Indirect inguinal hernia is one of the pathologies that is widely researched in national and&#xD;
      international studies because of its high prevalence in the community and its&#xD;
      life-threatening or permanent loss of function. However, no point has been reached regarding&#xD;
      the etiology of this disease and a consensus has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the study will contribute to the explanation of the formation&#xD;
      mechanisms of the mentioned disease. Considering the high prevalence of this disease and its&#xD;
      potential for life-threatening, the investigators anticipate that the analysis of the&#xD;
      relevant genes for the Turkish population will make significant contributions to the public&#xD;
      health. In the literature, analysis of GATA6 SNPs in the Chinese population has subsequently&#xD;
      associated certain polymorphisms with indirect inguinal hernia. It is also been stated that&#xD;
      TBX3 gene pathologies may be associated with inguinal hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is no study in the literature about the patent processus vaginalis expression&#xD;
      levels of these genes. There is no study on the SNP analysis of these genes in Turkish&#xD;
      population. For these reasons, the first time the expression / SNP analysis of the specified&#xD;
      genes in Turkish society will be carried out will make an additional contribution to&#xD;
      scientific knowledge. As stated clearly in the studies, the implementation of medical&#xD;
      treatment of indirect inguinal hernia may change the approach of the pediatric surgical&#xD;
      community to indirect inguinal hernia. In order for medical treatment to be carried out, the&#xD;
      formation pathways and genetic origins of the disease must be clearly revealed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigating the relationship of GATA6 and TBX3 genes, which are known to be involved in&#xD;
      connective tissue homeostasis, with the mechanisms of indirect inguinal hernia formation,&#xD;
      will contribute to the studies in the literature and is important in terms of revealing&#xD;
      whether the treatment of these diseases can be performed medically in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to reveal that gene expression levels in indirect inguinal hernia sacs due to&#xD;
      SNPs in at least one of the GATA6 and TBX3 genes, thus causing an error in the sac closure&#xD;
      pathway. The hypothesis of the study; It is stated that the gene expression levels of at&#xD;
      least one of GATA6 and TBX3 in the sacs of inguinal hernia patients are altered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary goal of this study is; To determine the level of GATA6 and TBX3 gene expression&#xD;
      in sacs obtained from indirect inguinal hernia patients. The secondary goal is to investigate&#xD;
      SNPs in the leukocytes of these patients and to investigate whether the genetic elements in&#xD;
      our hypothesis in these diseases are regulated by different genes acting as transcription&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering that indirect inguinal hernia poses significant health risks, especially in&#xD;
      children, it is predicted that the results to be obtained may contribute to clarification of&#xD;
      the etiology and non-invasive methods other than surgery.&#xD;
