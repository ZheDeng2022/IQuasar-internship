      This trial investigates an educational program called Awareness, Information, and Resources&#xD;
      for Lung Cancer Screening Program in improving knowledge about lung cancer screening in&#xD;
      medically underserved communities. This program aims to educate and remove barriers to lung&#xD;
      cancer screening among medically underserved community members who are eligible for lung&#xD;
      cancer screening, and to improve access to evidence-based screening guidelines for early&#xD;
      detection for lung cancer in the Western New York area.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Collaborate with community organizations and leaders to leverage community-based assets to&#xD;
      disseminate education about lung cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Reach medically underserved, high risk community members. III. Enhance lung cancer&#xD;
      screening knowledge among medically underserved, high risk community members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Navigate screening-eligible community members to lung cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete the Roswell Awareness, Information and Resources for Lung Cancer&#xD;
      Screening (AIR) Program over 45 minutes and then receive the High-Risk Lung Cancer Tip Sheet.&#xD;
