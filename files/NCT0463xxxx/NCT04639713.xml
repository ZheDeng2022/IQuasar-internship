      procedure to reduce the appearance of the peri-orbital wrinkles. Up to 5 investigational&#xD;
      centers in Israel and the United States will participate in the recruitment. Each study&#xD;
      subject will receive four (4) treatments with Tixel in a monthly interval. Follow-up will&#xD;

      A Prospective, Multicenter, Single-Arm Clinical Study of 51 subjects who are seeking a&#xD;
      procedure to reduce the appearance of the periorbital wrinkles, and meet study eligibility&#xD;
      criteria, and have provided informed consent will be enrolled in the study. Up to 5&#xD;
      investigational centers in Israel and the United States will participate in the recruitment.&#xD;
      Each study subject will receive 4 treatments with Tixel in a monthly interval. Follow-up will&#xD;
      occur at 1 month and 3 months following the last treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinic visits will be as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline (1st tx)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phone-call visit (3 days after the first treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 4wk (2nd tx)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 8wk (3rd tx)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 12wk (4th tx)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. 4 weeks after the last treatment (1st FU)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. 12 weeks after the last treatment (2nd FU= 3 months FU, primary endpoint and study&#xD;
           completion visit) Primary Efficacy Endpoint is the comparison of the proportion of&#xD;
           subjects with a ≥ 1-score improvement on the FWCS at the 3-month visit compared to&#xD;
           baseline as determined by at least 2 out of 3 blinded Independent Photographic&#xD;
           Reviewers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Endpoint is the evaluation of related adverse events up to the 3-month visit&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
