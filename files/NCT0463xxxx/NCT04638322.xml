      the cognitive and functional capacities of Colombian older adults.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized clinical trial of single-blind with 2 arms (Control group and&#xD;
      experimental group), in which a pre-treatment-postest design has been used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will define two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A control group (CG) that will not be submitted to treatment, which will be evaluated in the&#xD;
      pre and post phase of the study. Participants assigned to this group will receive general&#xD;
      advice on the positive effects of regular physical activity and will be given a guide to&#xD;
      recommendations for promoting physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An experimental group (GE) that after an initial evaluation will undergo a physical training&#xD;
      program based on high intensity interval functional training exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the intervention is finished, it will be submitted to a final evaluation to see if there&#xD;
      is a difference or not with the results obtained at the beginning.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The assignment to the groups will be of simple random type and hidden. Those responsible for admitting patients to the intervention phase will not know what group has been assigned each. This assignment will be made in advance by a researcher who will not intervene in the later stages of evaluation, intervention, data recording and elaboration of database.

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>MoCA (Montreal Cognitive Assessment)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to twelve weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Instrument that examines the skills of attention, concentration, executive functions, memory, language, visuoconstructive abilities, calculation and orientation and the maximum score is 30.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>TMT (Trail Making Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to twelve weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to assess executive function. It measures timed motor and visual tasks, and is divided into two tests: Part A (TMTA), which assesses speed and psychomotor attention and requires connecting consecutively numbered circles; and Part B (TMTB), which tests executive function and requires connecting alternating circles of numbers and letters. Longer completion times indicate poor performance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Isaacs test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to twelve weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Instrument used to assess verbal fluency. Participants have 60 seconds to generate as many words as possible within a given semantic category (animals, colors, fruits, and cities). The maximum score is 40 points (with a maximum of 10 per category). The higher the score, the better the level of verbal fluency.Instrument used to assess verbal fluency.

    <measure>SFT (Senior Fitness Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to twelve weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Instrument used to assess functional abilities. It consists of the following tests: muscle strength (upper and lower limbs), aerobic endurance, flexibility (upper and lower limbs) and agility, 6-minute walk test, Sit-to-foot test using a chair (measures flexibility of the lower body, Try to clasp hands behind your back, Try to get up, walk 8 feet and sit back.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>D2 test</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to twelve weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Time-limited test to measure concentration. The test measures the processing speed, the following of instructions and the goodness of the execution in a task of discrimination of similar visual stimuli and that, therefore, allow the estimation of attention and concentration.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>DSST (The Digit Symbol Substitution Test)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to twelve weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Cognitive test to assess processing speed presented on a single sheet of paper that requires a subject to match symbols with numbers according to a key located at the top of the page. The subject copies the symbol into spaces below a row of numbers. The number of correct symbols within the allowed time, usually 90-120 seconds, constitutes the score.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to twelve weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>It evaluates, in a global way, the dispositional capacity of an individual to be attentive and aware of the experience of the present moment in everyday life. The scale is a 15-item univariate self-report with a view of the mindfulness construct centered on the attention / consciousness variable.</description>
