  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the present study is to confirm in humans the in-vivo bioconversion of a Prodrug&#xD;
      (PRX-P4-003) to (-)-fencamfamine (FCF) the active moiety when orally administered as a single&#xD;
      microdose. A second component of the study will evaluate effect of food on pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of PRX-P4-003.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A crossover study comparing blood concentrations after oral administration of microdoses of&#xD;
      (-)-fencamfamine (FCF; 40 µg) or its prodrug form (PRX-P4-003; 100 µg)) in the fasted state&#xD;
      will be carried out in 4 healthy male volunteers (Study A). This will be followed by&#xD;
      determination of blood concentrations of (-)-fencamfamine in a separate cohort of 4&#xD;
      volunteers following oral administration of a microdose of PRX-P4-003 (100 µg) in a fed state&#xD;
      (Study B).&#xD;
