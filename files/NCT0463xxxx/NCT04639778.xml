      Current guideline recommend yearly multidisciplinary postoperative follow-up after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. However, practices remain very heterogeneous, and only a fraction of patients are&#xD;
      still follow-up beyond two years after the operation.&#xD;

      This study will assess a new care pathway in which the patients are follow-up according to&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bariatric surgery is developing rapidly. In France, the number of annual interventions&#xD;
      increased threefold between 2001 and 2015, from 16,000 to 50,000 per year. This rapid&#xD;
      development is explained by the well-demonstrated benefits of surgery: spectacular&#xD;
      improvement in the quality of life, reduction in co-morbidities (diabetes, cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, and steatohepatitis), and significant reduction in mortality linked to severe&#xD;
      obesity. However, the benefits of surgery may decrease over time and may be associated with&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current guideline recommend yearly multidisciplinary postoperative follow-up after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. However, practices remain very heterogeneous, and only a fraction of patients are&#xD;
      still follow-up beyond two years after the operation. The current recommendations therefore&#xD;
      do not seem adapted to clinical reality. They do not prevent the regain of weight in many&#xD;
      patients, which frequently leads to re-operations. Even more worrying is the possible&#xD;
      occurrence of late complications, sometimes serious and life-threatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess a new care pathway in which the patients are follow-up according to&#xD;
      weight evolution measured by the patient using a connected scale.&#xD;

    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ) consists of 33 items and assesses on a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from &quot;never&quot; to &quot;very often&quot; external, restraint and emotional eating. For the study, only the 10 items of the external eating subscale will be used. The variable of interest will be the corresponding External eating subscale score.</description>

    <description>A food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) consists of a finite list of foods and beverages with response categories to indicate usual frequency of consumption over the time period queried. To assess the total diet, the number of foods and beverages queried typically ranges from 80 to 120.</description>

    <description>Short Form 36 v2.0 acute (SF-36) is a 36-item, patient-reported survey of patient health. SF-36 measures the subject's overall Health Related Quality of Life on 8 domains: physical functioning, role functioning, bodily pain, general health, vitality, social functioning, role emotional and mental health.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life of questionnaire EQ-5D-5L</measure>
    <time_frame>3 years</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire will be used to estimate the impact on subjects' health-related quality of life and provides a description of subjects' problems by dimensions (descriptive system), a score for overall self-rated health (visual analogue scale [VAS]) as well as an index score (EQ-5D-5L index). EQ-5D index score range: 0 to 1 and EQ-5D-VAS: range 0 to 100. A higher score indicates better self reported health status.</description>
