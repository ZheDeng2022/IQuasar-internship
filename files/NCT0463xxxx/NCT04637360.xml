    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease related mineral and bone disorders (CKD-MBDs) and secondary&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) are observed in most patients with chronic kidney disease on&#xD;
      dialysis (CKD-5D). The original use of the calcimimetic cinacalcet in these patients was to&#xD;
      reduce the elevated parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels; however, subsequent clinical studies&#xD;
      consistently confirmed its beneficial effects on mineral disturbances and bone disease.&#xD;
      Although many mechanisms proposed, its specific mechanisms underlying the bone disease is&#xD;
      still unclear. Recently, Wnt signaling and their inhibitors were proposed to involve in fine&#xD;
      control of osteoclast-to-osteoblast cross-talk. In previous study, investigators explore the&#xD;
      changes in Wnt 10b in bone microenvironment after addition of calcimimetic cinacalcet using&#xD;
      in vitro osteoclasts. In vitro results were confirmed in 5/6 nephrectomy mice, which were&#xD;
      grouped into control, with cinacalcet and without cinacalcet groups. From in-vitro study,&#xD;
      investigators found cinacalcet increase mineralization; enhance osteoclast apoptosis, which&#xD;
      probably work as osteoclast-osteoblast cross talk for bone formation. Similar results were&#xD;
      found in-vivo animal study, and the micro-CT of cinacalcet treated CKD animals revealed a&#xD;
      significantly decrease in cortical porosity. On the basis of our in-vitro and animal study,&#xD;
      investigators propose that cinacalcet have definitive role on bone turnover marker and bone&#xD;
      density changes among SHPT dialysis patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Our study includes 50 hyperparathyroid dialysis patients using cinacalcet from 1st&#xD;
      Dec 2017 to 31 Oct 2018. Investigators will exclude post-menopausal female subjects.&#xD;
      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and Western blot analysis will be done for bone turnover&#xD;
      markers (TRACP，Alk-P，S1P，BMP6，Wnt，10B，16，SOST，P1NP，PDGF BB，HGF and CTHRC1, etc.). Bone&#xD;
      mineral density will be determined by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Plasma&#xD;
      fibroblast growth factor (FGF-23), Ca 2+ , P 3+ , calcium-phosphorus product and parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone will also be measured. Data will be collected and analyzed the differences between&#xD;
      baseline measures and 4 weekly and follow up for 6 months after the treatment. Control group&#xD;
      that we enrolled 30 hyperparathyroid dialysis patients using traditional therapy active&#xD;
      vitamin D without use cinacalcet.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Secondary hyperparathyroidism (SHPT) is an important mechanism underlying most&#xD;
      cardiovascular and bone turnover disorders in CKD-5D patients, which contribute highest&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality annually. Impair phosphate excretion and failure to bioactivate&#xD;
      vitamin D during progressive renal function deterioration continuously stimulates the&#xD;
      synthesis and secretion of parathyroid glands. Increase serum phosphate stimulates the&#xD;
      phosphatonin fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23) releases from osteocytes and osteoblasts.&#xD;
      Elevated FGF-23 downregulates renal 25(OH)-1-hydroxylase which further deteriorates SHPT.&#xD;
      Prolonged parathyroid gland functional activation leads to progressive parathyroid&#xD;
      hyperplasia. Downregulation of the parathyroid vitamin D receptors and calcium-sensing&#xD;
      receptors occurs within parathyroid gland, and principally responsible for the parathyroid&#xD;
      hyperplasia. Hyperparathyroidism and alteration in mineral metabolism, especially&#xD;
      hyperphosphatemia, modulate renal osteodystrophy and vascular calcification (together known&#xD;
      as CKD-MBD). Continuously high PTH during SHPT stimulates osteoclastic resorption and bone&#xD;
      remodeling rates, which leads to classic osteitis fibrosa. Excessive osteoblast viability and&#xD;
      activity because of persistent hyperparathyroidism may follow to compensate for the bone&#xD;
      resorption, with resultant osteosclerosis. Metastatic calcification and vascular&#xD;
      calcification occur as a result of increased calcium and phosphate solubility product in&#xD;
      extracellular fluid. The degree of mineralization is impaired in those with a high-turnover&#xD;
      status because the recently formed bone is removed rapidly without adequate mineralization.&#xD;
      Bones from a high-turnover state have lower mineralization and lower trabecular microhardness&#xD;
      than do bones from normal or low-turnover states. A low mineral-to-matrix ratio and low&#xD;
      carbonate-to-phosphate ratio reduce bone toughness. Moreover, collagen crosslinking&#xD;
      abnormalities have been observed in both serum and soft tissue, which were responsible for&#xD;
      bone quality in these patients. High PTH also generates microstructural damage at both the&#xD;
      cortical and trabecular levels in CKD patients. Specifically, with chronic excess PTH&#xD;
      secretion, increased catabolism and decreased cortical thickness is noted in cortical bone;&#xD;
      whereas in trabecular bone, increased trabecular thickness with disturbed trabecular quality&#xD;
      are noted. Taking together, SHPT patients have a higher risk of skeletal fractures and poor&#xD;
      clinical outcomes associated with both bone quantity and quality loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, bone histomorphometry is still considered as the gold standard though clinically&#xD;
      unfeasible due to its invasive and technician-dependent nature. Serum intact PTH (iPTH) and&#xD;
      BSAP are recently used as markers of turnover to discriminate renal osteodystrophy. High&#xD;
      serum iPTH and BSAP considered as high-turnover bone disease, whereas low serum iPTH, low&#xD;
      BSAP, and normal vitamin D levels occur in adynamic bone disease (ABD) patients. Low vitamin&#xD;
      D and PTH levels in conjunction with high levels of BSAP are correlated with osteomalacia.&#xD;
      The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guideline use intact parathyroid&#xD;
      hormone (iPTH) as a reliable surrogate marker for bone turnover and suggested that iPTH&#xD;
      should be maintained in a target range between 150 and 300 pg ml-1 for patients with stage 5&#xD;
      CKD patients. However, some studies33 also found discrepancies between iPTH and&#xD;
      histomorphometry findings in dialysis patients. Bone-derived markers of bone formation and&#xD;
      resorption may be required to accurately measure bone structure and function in these&#xD;
      patients. Bone formation markers including bone-specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP),&#xD;
      osteocalcin, and procollagen type-1 N-terminal propeptide (P1NP) are markers of osteoblast&#xD;
      function. Bone resorption markers such as tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase 5b (Trap-5b)&#xD;
      and C-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (CTX) are markers of osteoclast number and&#xD;
      function. Trap-5b and BSAP are not cleared by the kidneys and are mostly used in CKD patients&#xD;
      as useful biomarkers. Osteocalcin, P1NP monomer, and CTX are cleared by the kidneys, and&#xD;
      their usefulness in treating CKD patients remains unclear. Although many other circulating&#xD;
      markers for bone remodeling disorders in CKD 34 patients have been evaluated, their clinical&#xD;
      uses still not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human genetic studies have highlighted the crucial role of wingless (Wnt) signaling in bone&#xD;
      mass regulation. Wnts are extracellular proteins that are linked to intracellular canonical&#xD;
      and noncanonical Wnt signaling pathways when activated. They were found to be implicated in&#xD;
      osteoblast and osteoclastic differentiation and function35, which are critical for trabecular&#xD;
      and cortical bone mass. Wnt3a and Wnt10b, acting through canonical signaling; and Wnt16,&#xD;
      acting through both canonical and noncanonical signaling, induce production of OPG in&#xD;
      osteoblasts. OPG binds to the osteoclast-inducing cytokine RANKL and thereby inhibits&#xD;
      osteoclast differentiation. Osteoblast Wnt5a potentiates RANK-induced osteoclast&#xD;
      differentiation by activating ROR2-dependent noncanonical signaling. By contrast, Wnt 4 and&#xD;
      Wnt 16 act directly through noncanonical signaling on osteoclast progenitors to inhibit&#xD;
      RANKL-induced osteoclast formation. In addition to these known concepts about&#xD;
      osteoblast-lineage cells influence on osteoclast precursors, recent researchers found that&#xD;
      osteoclasts are capable of producing 'clastokines' that regulate osteoblast performance and&#xD;
      bone formation. A study demonstrated that osteoclasts recruit osteoprogenitors and promote&#xD;
      mineralization through the release of chemokine sphingosine 1 phosphate(S1P), bone&#xD;
      morphogenetic protein 6 (BMP6) and Wnt10b. Further, osteoclast production of Wnt 10b found to&#xD;
      mediate mineralization through increased TGF-βduring bone resorption phase. The sophisticated&#xD;
      role of Wnt signaling in the human CKD and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population still&#xD;
      requires exploration. Several therapeutic interventions (active vitamin D analogues,&#xD;
      phosphate binders, calcimimetics or surgical parathyroidectomy) are used nowadays to modulate&#xD;
      mineral disturbances in order to reduce the CKD-MBD related clinical consequences.&#xD;
      Calcimimetics, such as cinacalcet, a positive allosteric modulator of the calcium sensing&#xD;
      receptor (CaSR), increases the PTH sensitivity to extracellular calcium and subsequently&#xD;
      reduces the PTH secretion. Extensive preclinical studies have indicated that calcimimetics&#xD;
      also arrest the progression of parathyroid hyperplasia. Combined randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      (RCTs) and phase 4 studies confirmed the pleiotropic effects of calcimimetic agents in&#xD;
      clinical grounds, including reduction of the elevated bone formation rate/tissue area with&#xD;
      improvement in high turnover bone disorders. Some studies also confirm that adding&#xD;
      calcimimetic cinacalcet can reduce the risk of fractures in SHPT patients. A bone&#xD;
      histomorphologic study of 4 HD patients under cinacalcet treatment revealed decreased bone&#xD;
      fibrosis, osteoblast surface and osteoid-related parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although mechanisms of calcimimetics in parathyroid hyperplasia are clearly explored, its&#xD;
      effects on osteoclasts and osteoblasts (basic multicellular units) at bone remodeling sites&#xD;
      are still unclear. A study revealed high extracellular calcium induces mitogenic action of&#xD;
      osteoblasts via calcium-sensing receptors. However, another in vitro study on mouse and human&#xD;
      adult osteoclastic and osteoblastic cells demonstrated the calcium dependent increase&#xD;
      osteoblast formation and decrease osteoclast formation/function might not through the calcium&#xD;
      sensing receptors, and not effected by calcimimetics. The calcimimetics might have any other&#xD;
      mechanisms not through effects on calcium or calcium sensing receptors on these osteoblasts.&#xD;
      Based on above information, investigators hypothesized that bone turnover markers including&#xD;
      Wnt changes occur in SHPT hemodialysis patients. In addition, investigators consider the&#xD;
      hypothetical role of cinacalcet mediated bone turnover changes occurred in the process of&#xD;
      cinacalcet related bone anabolism.&#xD;
