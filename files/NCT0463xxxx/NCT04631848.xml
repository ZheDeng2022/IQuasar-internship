  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this single-arm, exploratory study is to evaluate safety and performance of&#xD;
      treatment of critical limb ischemia (CLI) with the ULTRASCORE™ Focused Force balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with CLI in below the knee vessels will receive a percutaneous transluminal&#xD;
      angioplasty with the device and will be followed up for 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This single-arm, prospective, multi-center CE marked study (IIT) is planned to include up to&#xD;
      80 subjects with CLI in below the knee vessels with de novo stenoses or non-stented&#xD;
      re-stenotic in total greater or equal 70% stenosis or occlusion of lower limb lesion. During&#xD;
      the index procedure at Day 1 patients will be treated with ULTRASCORE™ Focused Force balloon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up investigations for evaluation of parameters for primary and secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be performed at 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after the index procedure..&#xD;
