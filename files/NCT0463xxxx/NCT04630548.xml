      Sixty six women who plan to deliver a live birth singleton via cesarean delivery who desire a&#xD;
      Copper IUD for postpartum contraception will be approached for study participation thenvwill&#xD;
      be randomized equally into two groups using computer generated numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (A): (n=33) women IUD insertion post placental delivery (within 10mins) Group (B):&#xD;
      (n=33) women IUD insertion post puerperal ( 6 to 8 weeks postpartum). Primary outcome will&#xD;
      include IUD expulsion rate in both groups. Secondary outcomes will include other&#xD;
      complications rates: missed threads (not seen by speculum examination), displaced IUD (more&#xD;
      than 2 cm from the fundus in ultrasound), heavy puerperal bleeding, abdominal discomfort),&#xD;
      Pregnancy rate, Discontinuation of the IUD usage and Satisfaction rate.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Full history taking including a detailed history including medical and obstetric history,&#xD;
      full obstetric examination and ultrasound evaluation to confirm gestational age and to&#xD;
      exclude any of the exclusion criteria. Women who plan to deliver a live birth singleton via&#xD;
      cesarean delivery at Kasr El-Ainy teaching will be considered for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      Women who desire a Copper IUD for postpartum contraception will be approached for study&#xD;
      participation. The postpartum contraception plan will be documented during their prenatal&#xD;
      course. It is also addressed by the obstetrical team upon admission to Labor &amp; Delivery at&#xD;
      El-Kasr El-Ainy teaching hospital. The obstetrical team will identify subjects who present in&#xD;
      labor who meet the criteria and express interest in intrauterine contraception. Immediately&#xD;
      after cesarean delivery, consented subjects will be randomized to immediate post placental&#xD;
      IUD placement within 10 minutes or IUD placement at their routine standard postpartum visit&#xD;
      (6 to 8 weeks postpartum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women randomized to the immediate post placental IUD insertion (n=33) the following will&#xD;
      be done:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after placental delivery, uterine cavity will be examined to exclude the presence of&#xD;
           malformations or fibroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Uterus will be stabilized by grasping it at fundus and the copper IUD (CuT 380 PREGNA&#xD;
           IUD) will be placed (within 10 minutes following the placental delivery) through the&#xD;
           uterine wall incision high up in the uterine fundus (either by hand or using its&#xD;
           applicator).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before closing the uterine incision, the IUD strings will be guided to the lower uterine&#xD;
           segment without trimming (If the cervix is closed, it should be dilated from above using&#xD;
           a dilator).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enough care should be taken not to dislodge the IUD from its fundal position or to&#xD;
           include the strings in uterine sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IUD threads will protrude through the cervix in some cases its trimming will be done&#xD;
           during follow-up if the patient is feeling any discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before discharge, the patient will be given a card including the intervention done (date&#xD;
           &amp; procedure), the follow-up schedule and investigator contacts. Also, they will be&#xD;
           informed about normal postpartum symptoms, IUD side effects &amp; possible complications&#xD;
           (abdominal cramps, heavy puerperal bleeding, expulsion or protrusion of string) and&#xD;
           instruct to seek medical help (to call the principle investigator) if any of the&#xD;
           following warning signs have happened (severe lower abdominal pain, severe vaginal&#xD;
           bleeding, infected discharge or lochia, fever, IUD expulsion &amp; suspicion of pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are randomized for IUD insertion at their post puerperal visit will be assisted&#xD;
      in scheduling a postpartum visit and IUD placement with their usual obstetrical care&#xD;
      provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For women randomized for IUD insertion at their postpartum visit (n=33) the following will be&#xD;
      done:(n=33):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IUD will be inserted 6 - 8 weeks following caesarean delivery (during the post puerperal&#xD;
           visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaginal speculum will be inserted to expose the cervix &amp; to exclude concomitant&#xD;
           infection or bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The anterior lip of the cervix will be grasped using ring forceps followed by uterine&#xD;
           sounding to assess uterine cavity length.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IUD loaded sheath applicator (CuT 380 PREGNA IUD) will be introduced gently through&#xD;
           the cervical canal and advanced slowly towards the uterine fundus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When fundal placement is confirmed, IUD will be released &amp; the sheath will be withdrawn&#xD;
           followed by trimming of the IUD string at 1 cm below the level of cervix.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the insertion, transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) will be done to assure fundal&#xD;
           placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difficulties in insertion and patient discomfort will be recorded. Before leaving the&#xD;
           clinic, the patient will be given a card including the intervention done (date &amp;&#xD;
           procedure), the follow-up schedule and investigator contacts. Also, they will be&#xD;
           informed about potential IUD side effects &amp; possible complications (abdominal cramps,&#xD;
           vaginal bleeding, expulsion) and instruct to seek medical help (to call the principle&#xD;
           investigator) if any of the following warning signs have happened (severe lower&#xD;
           abdominal pain, severe vaginal bleeding, infected discharge, fever, IUD expulsion &amp;&#xD;
           suspicion of pregnancy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women who are going to have their IUD placement in post puerperal visits their contact&#xD;
      numbers will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      follow-up visits at 6 weeks ,3 &amp; 6 months post-insertion will be scheduled. At 6 weeks&#xD;
      post-insertion visit, participants (will be assessed via ultrasound and (to detect IUD&#xD;
      expulsion or displacement) and speculum examination ( to detect presence of IUD threads).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 3 months post-insertion visit, all subjects will be examined. Examination will include&#xD;
      ultrasound (to detect IUD expulsion or displacement) and speculum examination ( to detect&#xD;
      presence of IUD threads if not detected at 6 weeks post-insertion visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 6 months post-insertion visit, all subjects will be examined &amp; answering a simple&#xD;
      questionnaire. Examination will include ultrasound (to detect IUD expulsion or displacement)&#xD;
      and speculum examination ( to detect presence of IUD threads if not detected at 3 months&#xD;
      post-insertion visit). The questionnaire will include questions regarding they have had a&#xD;
      known expulsion, pregnancy event, or elective IUD removal and about the ease of placement and&#xD;
      overall satisfaction with the timing of placement.&#xD;
