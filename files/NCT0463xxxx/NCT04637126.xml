  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac output monitoring is a key component for the diagnosis and management of critically&#xD;
      ill patients. The two less invasive methods commonly used in intensive care are transthoracic&#xD;
      echocardiography and transpulmonary thermodilution. The objective of this study is to compare&#xD;
      accuracy and trending ability of CO measurement by TPTD and TTE in critically ill patients&#xD;
      with sinus rhythm.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      TTE is an easy noninvasive device now recommended as the first evaluation of the patient in&#xD;
      circulatory failure but it present some limits due to poor echogenicity of patients,&#xD;
      operator-dependent variability and cannot provide continuous hemodynamic data. TPTD is an&#xD;
      invasive technique for CO monitoring recommended especially in shock not responsive to&#xD;
      initial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have evaluated the level of agreement of each method (TTE and TPTD) with the&#xD;
      reference method (pulmonary artery catheter) but they have never been compared between them&#xD;
      with strong statistical analysis in particular trending ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It could be interesting to determine the level of concordance of these two methods of CO&#xD;
      monitoring and trend ability by TPTD relative to TTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that CO-TPTD are concordant with those performed by TTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanically ventilated patients requiring hemodynamic assessment will be included. CO-TPTD&#xD;
      will be measured via intermittent thermodilution. Blindly, a second investigator will use&#xD;
      standard-view TTE to estimate CO-TTE as the product of stroke volume and the heart rate&#xD;
      obtained during the measurement the blood flow velocity (using a Doppler technique) at the&#xD;
      left ventricular outflow tract. A second measurement will be done with the two devices after&#xD;
      a fluid challenge when patient requires it to compare trending ability.&#xD;
