  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Etoposide-cisplatin/ -carboplatin in combination with Atezolizumab for 4 cycles followed by&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with Atezolizumab is currently the world-wide first-line treatment for&#xD;
      extensive-stage small cell lung cancer. When 4 cycles of EC/EP chemotherapy combined with&#xD;
      Atezolizumab are effective, guidelines recommend additional thoracic radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, the investigators bring radiotherapy forward, which means that after 2 cycles&#xD;
      of EC/EP chemotherapy plus Atezolizumab, participants with response（PR/CR/SD）will receive&#xD;
      concurrent radiotherapy and 2 cycles of EC/EP chemotherapy plus Atezolizumab, then&#xD;
      maintenance therapy with Atezolizumab（Q3W）.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate participants will receive SBRT for metastatic lesions. The purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to explore the safety and efficacy of Atezolizumab combined with concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy in untreated participants with extensive-stage small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

      participants receive EC/EP chemotherapy combined with Atezolizumab for 2 cycles, and the&#xD;
      efficacy will be evaluated. If the efficacy evaluation is SD/PR/CR, concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy comined with EC/EP(2 cycles) + Atezolizumab will be initiated. After&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiotherapy + Atezolizumab, Atezolizumab was maintained until PD or&#xD;
      intolerance or for at most 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      participants with brain metastases will receive radiotherapy for brain metastases during the&#xD;
      first 2 cycles of chemotherapy.&#xD;
