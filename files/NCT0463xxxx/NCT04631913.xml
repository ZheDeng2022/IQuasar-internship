  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Oats are a commonly consumed source of viscous soluble fibre, which has an established role&#xD;
      in cardiovascular disease risk management including in cholesterol and glycemic control. Oat&#xD;
      beta-glucan is recognized for its cholesterol-lowering effects with approved health claims in&#xD;
      Canada, US and Europe. However, the efficacy of oat beta-glucan on glycemic control is not&#xD;
      clear. We propose to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis to explore the efficacy of&#xD;
      whole grain oats and oat beta-glucan on markers of glycemic control in people with, without&#xD;
      or at risk for diabetes.&#xD;

      RATIONALE Although oat beta-glucan has approved health claims in Canada, US, and Europe [1-3]&#xD;
      and is recognized by major cardiovascular guidelines [4,5] for its cholesterol-lowering,&#xD;
      there are no approved health claims for the maintenance or achievement of normal blood&#xD;
      glucose [6] and its role in the prevention and management of diabetes are less clear. We are&#xD;
      not aware of any systematic reviews and meta-analyses of prospective cohort studies of the&#xD;
      relation of the intake of whole oats, oat products, or oat beta-glucan with diabetes risk.&#xD;
      Although there are several systematic reviews and meta-analyses of randomized trials showing&#xD;
      that oats and oat beta-glucan improve markers of glycemic control and insulin resistance&#xD;
      [7-9], the census for theses analyses do not include new RCTs [10]. Similar to an evidence&#xD;
      synthesis that we conducted for all viscous fibers (inclusive of oat beta-glucan) [11], we&#xD;
      propose to conduct the &quot;gold-standard: in evidence synthesis (a systematic review and&#xD;
      meta-analysis of randomized trials using Grading of Recommendations Assessment Development&#xD;
      and Evaluation [GRADE] system) to quantify and assess the certainty of the evidence for the&#xD;
      effect of oats and oat beta-glucan on established targets for glycemic control including&#xD;
      HbA1c, fasting glucose, fasting insulin, and measures of insulin sensitivity in participants&#xD;
      stratified by their risk of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES To quantify and assess the certainty of the evidence for the effect of oats and&#xD;
      oat beta-glucan on established targets for glycemic control including HbA1c, fasting plasma&#xD;
      glucose (FPG), 2h-plasma glucose (2h-PG), fasting plasma insulin, and measures of insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and beta-cell function in participants who have diabetes, are at risk of diabetes&#xD;
      (prediabetes, metabolic syndrome, or overweight/obese), or are otherwise healthy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN We will follow the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions [12] and&#xD;
      report according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses&#xD;
      (PRISMA) [13]. The protocol will be registered at www.clinicaltrials.gov.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SOURCES MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials will be&#xD;
      searched for eligible trials. We will also supplement our search with manual searches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY SELECTION We will include randomized controlled trials of ≥2-weeks assessing the effect&#xD;
      of whole grain oats or oat beta-glucan compared with a suitable non-oat control on&#xD;
      established targets for glycemic control including HbA1c, fasting plasma glucose, 2h-plasma&#xD;
      glucose (2h-PG), fasting plasma insulin, and measures of insulin resistance in participants&#xD;
      with or without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA EXTRACTION Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data. Authors&#xD;
      will be contacted for additional information and any missing data will be computed/imputed&#xD;
      using standard formulae [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      RISK OF BIAS Two or more investigators will independently assess risk of bias using the&#xD;
      Cochrane Risk of Bias 2.0 Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES The outcomes will include established targets for glycemic control including HbA1c,&#xD;
      fasting plasma glucose (FPG), 2h-plasma glucose (2h-PG), fasting plasma insulin, and measures&#xD;
      of hepatic insulin sensitivity (HOMA-IR, hyperinsulinemic euglycemic clamp) whole body&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity (Matsuda OGTT-ISI, frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test&#xD;
      [FSIGTT], hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp) and beta-cell function (insulin secretion index,&#xD;
      ISSI-2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA SYNTHESIS Data will be pooled using the Generic Inverse Variance method stratified by&#xD;
      risk of diabetes. Random effects models will be used with paired analyses applied to&#xD;
      crossover designs [14]. Heterogeneity will be assessed (Cochran Q statistic) and quantified&#xD;
      (I2 statistic). Sources of heterogeneity will be explored by sensitivity analyses. If ≥10&#xD;
      trial comparisons are available, a priori subgroup analyses will also be conducted to explore&#xD;
      sources of heterogeneity (dose, comparator, intervention form (whole grain oat or oat&#xD;
      beta-glucan) follow-up, baseline levels, design, body weight change, saturated fat intake,&#xD;
      carbohydrate intake, protein intake, intervention food matrix, oat beta-glucan molecular&#xD;
      weight and risk of bias). Meta-regression will assess the significance of subgroup analyses.&#xD;
      Linear and nonlinear dose-response analyses will be assessed by generalized least squares&#xD;
      trend (GLST) estimation models and spline curve modelling (MKSPLINE procedure), respectively.&#xD;
      When ≥10 trial comparisons are available, publication bias will be assessed by inspection of&#xD;
      funnel plots and the Egger and Begg tests. Adjustment for evidence of funnel plot asymmetry&#xD;
      or small study effects will be conducted by the Duval and Tweedie trim-and-fill method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GRADE ASSESSMENT To assess the certainty of the evidence, we will use the GRADE system, an&#xD;
      evidence-based grading system adopted by &gt;100 organizations&#xD;
      (http://www.gradeworkinggroup.org/). It grades the evidence as high, moderate, low or very&#xD;
      low quality based on the study design and a series of downgrades (risk of bias, imprecision,&#xD;
      inconsistency, indirectness, publication bias) and upgrades (large magnitude of the effect,&#xD;
      dose-response gradient, and attenuation by confounding). We will follow the GRADE handbook&#xD;
      (https://gdt.gradepro.org/app/handbook/handbook.html) and use the GRADEpro (GRADEprofiler)&#xD;
      software Version 3.2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KNOWLEDGE TRANSLATION PLAN FOR IMPACT We will follow the Ottawa model of Research for&#xD;
      knowledge translation [15]. The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national, and international scientific meetings and publication in&#xD;
      high impact journals. Target audiences will include public health and clinical communities&#xD;
      with an interest in nutrition and cardiovascular disease. Feedback will be incorporated and&#xD;
      used to improve public health messages and key areas for future research will be defined. The&#xD;
      PIs will network among opinion leaders to increase awareness and participate directly in the&#xD;
      development of future guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE The proposed project will aid in knowledge translation related to the role of&#xD;
      whole grain oats and oat fiber as add-on therapy in the primary and secondary prevention of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, strengthening the evidence-base for guidelines development in the&#xD;
      U.S., Canada, Europe, and beyond and improving health outcomes, by educating healthcare&#xD;
      providers and patients, stimulating industry innovation, and guiding future research design.&#xD;
