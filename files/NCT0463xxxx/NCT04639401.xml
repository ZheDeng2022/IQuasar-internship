    <textblock>
      This study is a case-control observational study, involving persons with multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      and healthy controls. The study contains 1 descriptive and 4 experimental sessions. In the&#xD;
      descriptive session, participant's clinical motor and cognitive functions are collected. In&#xD;
      the first experimental session, participant's beat perception and synchronisation abilities&#xD;
      is examined within a finger tapping paradigm. In the following experimental sessions&#xD;
      participants synchronsiation abilities is examined during walking paradigms, to music and&#xD;
      metronomes, at different tempi and alignment strategies. In the latter three sessions, apart&#xD;
      from outcome measures of synchronization the following will be collected as well:&#xD;
      spatio-temporal gait parameters, perceived fatigue, perceived motivation and perceived speed&#xD;
      of walking.&#xD;
