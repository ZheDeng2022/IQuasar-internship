    <textblock>
      Randomized parallel study investing the effect of intake of different protein sources (whey,&#xD;
      insect and pea) on the muscle protein synthesis. Activation of the signaling pathway leading&#xD;
      to muscle protein synthesis is investigated by western blotting and Real time quantitative&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction (qPCR or PCR). Urine, blood and muscle is moreover investigated by&#xD;
      metabolomics analysis.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia is a syndrome highly prevalent in the older population, characterized by muscle&#xD;
      loss and a decrease in muscle strength. This leads to loss of physical function, decreased&#xD;
      life quality and well-being and an increased risk of early death. Research has shown that&#xD;
      both ingestion of protein and physical activity is able to diminish the loss of muscle mass&#xD;
      during aging and thereby reduce the prevalence of sarcopenia and diminish the consequence of&#xD;
      the disease. This study will investigate if more sustainable protein sources of good quality&#xD;
      can increase the muscle protein synthesis and thereby prevent sarcopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this project is to investigate the effects of insect protein on the stimulation of&#xD;
      muscle protein synthesis. The effects of protein will both be studied alone and in&#xD;
      combination with exercise in perspective of preventing loss of both muscle mass and muscle&#xD;
      strength. The potential of insect protein will be elucidated by comparison with other&#xD;
      alternative plant-based protein sources in this case pea protein. In addition, whey protein&#xD;
      will be included as a positive control as it may be regarded as the most established dietary&#xD;
      protein source combatting muscle loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young(18-30 years old) healthy men (n=60) are randomized in 3 groups to ingest either insect&#xD;
      protein, pea protein or whey protein. Urine are collected 24 hours prior to the experiment&#xD;
      while a blood sample and a muscle biopsy is collected at the beginning of the study. The&#xD;
      subjects are instructed to perform one-leg exercise (knee extension, 5 sets of 10&#xD;
      repetitions, 10 repetitions-maximum) after which the subjects ingest the assigned protein&#xD;
      bolus. Urine and blood samples are collected in the following hours and one muscle biopsy is&#xD;
      collected from both the exercised and the non-exercised leg at 3 hours after protein&#xD;
      ingestion. The expression of messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein related to the mTORC pathway in&#xD;
      the muscle is investigated by qPCR and western blotting. In addition, metabolites in urine,&#xD;
      blood plasma and muscle tissue are investigated by metabolomics analysis.&#xD;
