  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      90 sedentary adults with a primary anxiety disorder and high anxiety sensitivity will be&#xD;
      randomized to either 8 weeks of 1) low intensity exercise, or 2) flexible titration to high&#xD;
      intensity exercise (HIE). Blinded, validated clinician-rated and patient-rated outcomes will&#xD;
      be assessed over treatment and at 1- and 3-month follow-up. To better understand what&#xD;
      mechanisms influence decisions to exercise in the real-world, we will use of heart rate (HR)&#xD;
      as an objective mechanistic target for exercise intensity, examine changes in valuation of&#xD;
      exercise through a neuroeconomics task, examine changes in interoceptive sensitivity with a&#xD;
      heartbeat detection task, and integrate of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) to measure&#xD;
      effects of immediate changes in mood with exercise on anxiety outcomes and adherence.&#xD;

    <description>All participants will receive psychoeducation regarding the rationale for using exercise as a strategy to create immediate changes in mood and anxiety. Participants will be instructed in basic motivational principles (e.g., breaking up goals into smaller parts, using rewards) based on information in Exercise for Mood and Anxiety. Participants will begin at low intensity with the goal of titrating to high intensity by 2 weeks prior to the end of trial (Week 6). If a participant achieves at least 70% of the duration goal at the target heart rate, he/she will be titrated to the next dose level (moderate intensity). This will continue until high intensity exercise is achieved. Prescription is based on heart rate reserve((maximum heart rate [220-age] - resting heart rate)*intensity percent - resting heart rate. Intensity percent lower/upper limits for moderate intensity are 40-59% and for high intensity are 60-84%.</description>
