      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impulsivity is acting 'without thinking.' Compulsivity is being overly inflexible. People&#xD;
      vary in how impulsive or compulsive they are. Extreme versions of these behaviors play a role&#xD;
      in mental disorders. Researchers want to study changes in the brain to learn more about these&#xD;
      behaviors. Differences in genes may also play a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn about genetic and brain features that explain why levels of impulsivity and&#xD;
      compulsivity vary across people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 6-80&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with a medical history and medical record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will talk about their mental and behavioral development. They may discuss topics&#xD;
      like drug use and sexual activity. They will complete surveys about their compulsivity and&#xD;
      impulsivity. Parents of child participants may also complete these surveys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may take memory, attention, and thinking tests. They may give blood or saliva&#xD;
      samples for gene studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a magnetic resonance imaging scan. It will take pictures of their&#xD;
      brain. The scanner is shaped like a cylinder. Participants will lie on a table that slides in&#xD;
      and out of the scanner. A coil will be placed over their head. They will lie still, watch a&#xD;
      movie, and play a game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may have a magnetoencephalography scan. It records brain activity. Participants&#xD;
      will sit in a room. A 'cone' of magnetic field detectors will be lowered around their head.&#xD;
      They will rest and play a game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may ask family members to join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants under age 25 may repeat these tests every 1-2 years until they turn 25 or until&#xD;
      the study ends. For those over age 25, participation will last less than 1 month.&#xD;

      Study Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many neuropsychiatric disorders have extreme impairing impulsivity and compulsivity behaviors&#xD;
      at their core. We hypothesized that the development of symptoms of impulsivity and&#xD;
      compulsivity during childhood/adolescence and early adulthood will be associated with&#xD;
      atypical trajectories of brain features including cortical glutamate (the main excitatory&#xD;
      neurotransmitter) and functional/structural brain connectivity. Additionally, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that cortical glutamate will be under genetic control (i.e., heritable) and that common&#xD;
      genetic variant risk for disorders characterized by extreme impulsivity (e.g., attention&#xD;
      deficit hyperactivity disorder) and by extreme compulsivity (e.g., obsessive compulsive&#xD;
      disorder) will also be associated with atypical cortical glutamate trajectories. To elucidate&#xD;
      the relationships between the developing brain, compulsivity/impulsivity and genomics, we&#xD;
      will collect clinical assessments including clinician-led interviews, neurobehavioral&#xD;
      assessments, neuroimaging data, and genomic samples using 1) a prospective longitudinal&#xD;
      design to answer developmental hypotheses; 2) an extended multigenerational family design to&#xD;
      assess genomic hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) To assess the effects of impulsivity and compulsivity on the developmental trajectories of&#xD;
      cortical glutamate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) To determine the heritability of cortical glutamate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) To establish the reliability of glutamate measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) To examine the impact of atypical glutamate levels on developing structural and functional&#xD;
      connections within the fronto-striatal circuits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Age-related change in cortical glutamate levels and its moderation by individual&#xD;
      differences in levels of impulsivity and compulsivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Heritability of cortical glutamate (proportion of variance explained by additive genetic&#xD;
      factors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) 1. Glutamate levels estimated at 3 Tesla at short intervals to establish test-retest&#xD;
      reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Glutamate levels estimated at both 3 Tesla and 7 Tesla (cross scanner validation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Measures of the brain s structural and functional connectivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to recruit 1100 participants over the next 7 years. Individuals between 6 and 80 years&#xD;
      of age with a wide range of impulsivity/compulsivity behaviors - ranging from normal to&#xD;
      mildly/extremely impaired - will be recruited. No specific demographic groups will be&#xD;
      targeted. Recruitment will be mainly done in the District of Columbia/Maryland/Virginia area,&#xD;
      however some participants needed for primary aim B (heritability) might travel from&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Sites/Facilities Enrolling Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institute of Health is the sole site for enrollment of participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The estimated study duration from the beginning of the study (study opens to enrollment) to&#xD;
      the end (completion of data analyses) is 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective A: Participants may complete follow-up visits for as long as the study is&#xD;
      open; thus, they might complete visits over a 7 to 10-year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective B: Participants will complete the study after one visit and may complete&#xD;
      forms at home; thus, the estimated time for participation is less than a month.&#xD;

        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Stated willingness to comply with all study procedures and availability for the&#xD;
             duration of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female, 6 years of age and under 80 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability of participant to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Cognitively not capable of performing study procedures or lack of capacity to provide&#xD;
             informed consent. Indications of a lack of cognitive capacity could include a known&#xD;
             full-scale IQ under 70, or a history from the screening interview that implies global&#xD;
             intellectual disabilities (e.g., placement in a school for children with intellectual&#xD;
             disability etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Very premature birth (i.e., birth before 32 weeks of gestational age).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any known brain abnormalities (e.g., tumor, periventricular leukomalacia,&#xD;
             microcephaly) or history of medical conditions known to affect cerebral anatomy (e.g.,&#xD;
             epilepsy, history of stroke, head injury with a loss of consciousness of one hour or&#xD;
             more).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Psychotic disorders (including schizophrenia, psychosis not otherwise specified).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Dementia, or other conditions that, in the opinion of the investigators, would impede&#xD;
             compliance or possibly hinder completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Additional exclusion criteria for optional MRI procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals who are not able to receive an MRI (e.g., metal bioimplants,&#xD;
             claustrophobia, inability to lie flat on their backs, pregnant women, and any other&#xD;
             contraindications for MRI scanning according to the NMR Center MRI safety guidelines).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Medications that are known to affect glutamate levels (e.g., riluzole, memantine, C-&#xD;
             cycloserine).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Antipsychotic medication (as these have a major impact on dopamine levels).&#xD;
