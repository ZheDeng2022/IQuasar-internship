      Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are life-saving practices in patients with&#xD;
      respiratory failure, and aspiration of secretions is often required to maintain airway&#xD;
      patency. Although tracheal aspiration is an unavoidable requirement to maintain airway&#xD;
      patency, it can bring many undesirable conditions. In the presence of complications, the&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay is also prolonged. In the literature, endotracheal aspiration is&#xD;
      defined as a painful and uncomfortable method for patients. However, pain is an undesirable&#xD;
      sensation that cannot be adapted. The most reliable source for pain assessment is the patient&#xD;
      himself. However, verbal communication with patients in the ICU is quite difficult due to&#xD;
      reasons such as the presence of endotracheal tube and tracheostomy, confusion, mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, and sedative drug use. Therefore, intensive care patients may not be able to&#xD;
      express their pain verbally. In this case, patient behavior becomes important in pain&#xD;
      assessment. Scales were developed for pain assessment of patients who could not express their&#xD;
      pain. The &quot;Behavioral Pain Scale&quot; (DAS) was developed by Payen et al. For this purpose and&#xD;
      made available to intensive care patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the study when&#xD;
      aspirating is required (Seeing pulmonary secretions in the endotracheal tube, tachypnea,&#xD;
      tachycardia, hypertension, worsening of oxygen saturation and / or arterial blood gas,&#xD;
      sawtooth pattern in the flow volume loop of the ventilator monitor and / or trachea Hearing&#xD;
      of coarse breathing sounds, Ppeak inspiratory pressure increase in mechanical ventilator in&#xD;

      localization of the pain will be recorded by VAS and VAS. . The patient will be aspirated&#xD;
      with the same aspiration technique in all patients by using a closed system aspiration&#xD;
      catheter by the other volunteer nurse. Aspiration procedure will be applied to each patient&#xD;
      according to the American association for respiratory care (AARC) aspiration guideline. The&#xD;
      nurse evaluating the pain will record whether the patients have pain with DAS and VAS, the&#xD;

      Endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation are life-saving practices in patients with&#xD;
      respiratory failure, and aspiration of secretions is often required to maintain airway&#xD;
      patency. Although tracheal aspiration is an unavoidable requirement to maintain airway&#xD;
      patency, it can bring many undesirable conditions. In the presence of complications, the&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay is also prolonged. In the literature, endotracheal aspiration is&#xD;
      defined as a painful and uncomfortable method for patients. However, pain is an undesirable&#xD;
      sensation that cannot be adapted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is thought that performing aspiration in accordance with the AARC guideline and listening&#xD;
      to music during the procedure reduce the pain in edotracheal aspiration. The most reliable&#xD;
      source for pain assessment is the patient himself. However, verbal communication with&#xD;
      patients in the ICU is quite difficult due to reasons such as the presence of endotracheal&#xD;
      tube and tracheostomy, confusion, mechanical ventilation, and sedative drug use. Therefore,&#xD;
      intensive care patients may not be able to express their pain verbally. In this case, patient&#xD;
      behavior becomes important in pain assessment. Scales were developed for pain assessment of&#xD;
      patients who could not express their pain. The &quot;Behavioral Pain Scale&quot; (DAS) was developed by&#xD;
      Payen et al. For this purpose and made available to intensive care patients. DAS consists of&#xD;
      three parts, including facial expression, upper extremity movements, and compliance with&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation, and a total of 12 items. Each section is given a score between 1 and&#xD;
      4. The lowest pain score obtained from the scale is 3 and the highest pain score is 12.&#xD;
      (Appendix 1) Patients with an unconscious communication can be established with a sign or&#xD;
      writing method instead of verbal communication with patients with tracheostomy or tracheal&#xD;
      tube. These patients can describe their pain without words. Visual pain scales can be used&#xD;
      for this purpose. Visual Pain Scale (VAS) is one of these scales. VAS was first used in the&#xD;
      1970s. The scale was defined by Selby et al. To evaluate the quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      cancer in the 1980s. VAS has been used in many studies evaluating different parameters after&#xD;
      the 1990s and has recently been used in the measurement of special conditions such as pain.&#xD;
      The test has proven itself for a long time and is a accepted test in the world literature.&#xD;
      Safe, easy to apply Is DAS an accurate pain descriptor for every application in intensive&#xD;
      care unit?;. This question guides the study. This study was planned with the thought that the&#xD;
      result may be misleading in applications such as eye care and aspiration that will trigger&#xD;
      reflex movements in intensive care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6-Research protocol, materials and methods: METHOD In this study, when alpha 0.05, = 0.10,&#xD;
      1-B 0.90 was taken, 32 patients were included in the study and the power of the test was&#xD;
      found to be P = 0.9657.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of Research: Research 01.07. It will be applied in the Anesthesia and Reanimation&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (EIB) of a university hospital between 2020 - 31.12.2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Type and Purpose of the Study: This study was planned as a prospective observational&#xD;
      study in order to examine whether conscious patients connected to mechanical ventilator in&#xD;
      the Anesthesia Intensive Care Unit experience pain during the closed system aspiration&#xD;
      procedure, and if pain is experienced, whether NAC is reliable in evaluating the pain&#xD;
      occurring in endotracheal aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Population and Sample of the Study: The population of the study was the sample of all&#xD;
      patients who were treated in the Anesthesia and Reanimation Intensive Care unit of a&#xD;
      university hospital between the research dates, and the patients who were connected to the&#xD;
      ventilator who agreed to participate in the study and underwent endotracheal aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Application Patients who meet the inclusion criteria and agree to participate in the&#xD;
      study when aspirating is required (Seeing pulmonary secretions in the endotracheal tube,&#xD;
      tachypnea, tachycardia, hypertension, worsening of oxygen saturation and / or arterial blood&#xD;
      gas, sawtooth pattern in the flow volume loop of the ventilator monitor and / or trachea&#xD;
      Hearing of coarse breathing sounds, Ppeak inspiratory pressure increase in mechanical&#xD;
      ventilator in volume-controlled mode, or tidal volume decrease in pressure-controlled mode,&#xD;
      etc.) by a volunteer nurse, whether there is pain before, during and after aspiration, the&#xD;
      severity and localization of the pain will be recorded by VAS and VAS. . The patient will be&#xD;
      aspirated with the same aspiration technique in all patients by using a closed system&#xD;
      aspiration catheter by the other volunteer nurse. Aspiration procedure will be applied to&#xD;
      each patient according to the American association for respiratory care (AARC) aspiration&#xD;
      guideline. The nurse evaluating the pain will record whether the patients have pain with DAS&#xD;
      and VAS, the severity and localization of the pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the Data: The data obtained from the study are SPSS v.22 (Statistical Package&#xD;
      for Social Sciences) package program will be used. When parametric test assumptions are&#xD;
      fulfilled, repeated measures variance analysis will be used in the analysis of more than two&#xD;
      measurements from a group, and Friedman test will be used when parametric test assumptions&#xD;
      are not fulfilled. The level of error will be considered as 0.05.&#xD;
