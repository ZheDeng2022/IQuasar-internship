  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laser-assisted cataract surgery is a common and precise procedure done to remove cataracts&#xD;
      from the eye. This procedure involves putting on a suction cup that applies a mild vacuum&#xD;
      seal around the eye to stabilize the eye during the laser procedure. This suction cup often&#xD;
      causes some bleeding under the conjunctiva around the eye which takes a few days to&#xD;
      disappear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the use of a well-known eye medication (normally for&#xD;
      treating glaucoma) called Brimonidine tartrate 0.15% (or Alphagan-P) in patients having&#xD;
      laser-assisted cataract surgery. The use of Brimonidine to reduce bleeding under the&#xD;
      conjunctiva is investigational, which means it has not been approved by Health Canada for use&#xD;
      outside of research studies like this one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will see if Brimonidine will help to reduce bleeding under the conjunctiva in&#xD;
      patients having laser-assisted cataract surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The focus of this study is to assess how the quality of care for patients undergoing&#xD;
      Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery (FLACS) can be improved through the application&#xD;
      of Brimonidine Tartrate 0.15% prior to the surgery. The surgery consists of the application&#xD;
      of a vacuum which can result in subconjunctival hemorrhage, a benign disorder. The importance&#xD;
      of this study is due to the considerable alarm and anxiety caused to the patients by the&#xD;
      hemorrhage which may cause them to seek our further unnecessary medical help and reduce their&#xD;
      ability to return to work or productivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the laser component of FLACS, the operated eye is secured with a suction cup or ring&#xD;
      with vacuum that causes significant subconjunctival hemorrhage. Brimonidine is a selective&#xD;
      alpha-2-adrenergic agonist that is a commonly used as a topical medication to treat glaucoma.&#xD;
      Besides its intraocular pressure lowering effect, it also has a vasoconstrictive effect. This&#xD;
      latter effect has been exploited to reduce bleeding in LASIK, cataract surgery, strabismus&#xD;
      surgery, as well as intravitreal injections. This study will examine the effectiveness of&#xD;
      Brimonidine to reduce subconjunctival hemorrhage during Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential side effects of topical application of Brimonidine eye drop may include blurred or&#xD;
      loss of vision, burning, dry, or itching eyes, discharge or excessive tearing, disturbed&#xD;
      color perception, double vision, halos around lights, headache, itching of the eye, night&#xD;
      blindness, overbright appearance of lights, redness of the eye or inner lining of the eyelid,&#xD;
      swelling of the eyelid, tearing of the eye, tunnel vision. The risk of this study to the&#xD;
      subject is negligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the degree of subconjunctival hemorrhage occurring in subjects undergoing&#xD;
      Femtosecond laser-assisted cataract surgery, following preoperative application of&#xD;
      Brimonidine 0.15%. Subconjunctival hemorrhage and its associated bulbar redness will be&#xD;
      measured using Bulbar Redness Score using the Oculus M5 following the surgery.&#xD;
