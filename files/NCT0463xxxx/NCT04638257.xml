  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bacterial vaginosis (BV) occurs in about 20% of pregnancies and responsible for up to 25% of&#xD;
      visits to gynecological clinics. BV is characterized by a shift in vaginal bacterial flora&#xD;
      from lactobacilli to pathogenic bacterial flora like Gardnerella and Mycoplasma. Risk factors&#xD;
      for the development of BV include douching, use of intrauterine contraceptive devices, new or&#xD;
      multiple sexual partners, smoking and African American background.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Diagnosis of BV based on Amsel's criteria and Nugent's scoring. In Amsel's criteria include:&#xD;
      presence of thin vaginal discharge, clue cells, vaginal fluid pH &gt;4.5 and positive whiff&#xD;
      test. The Nugent score is derived from gram-stained vaginal smear; yielding a score between 0&#xD;
      - 10. A score of, 4 is normal, 4 - 6 is intermediate and a score &gt;7 represents BV. CDC&#xD;
      recommends diagnosis of BV on the presence of &gt;3 Amsel criteria and a Nugent score &gt;7. FDA&#xD;
      recommends, verification of BV cure should be conducted 21 - 30 days after the initiation of&#xD;
      therapy (absence of Amsel's criteria and Nugent score &lt;4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cure rate of BV with conventional anti-microbial agents have been disappointing due to high&#xD;
      recurrence rate of BV. Recurrence of BV results in repeated exposure to anti-microbial agents&#xD;
      which may lead to emergence of drug-resistance strains &amp; the potential for adverse reactions.&#xD;
      This suggests a need for alternative therapeutic measures of BV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lactobacilli rhamnosus GR-1 and Lactobacilli fermentum RC-14 are H2O2 producing lactobacilli&#xD;
      which are toxic to bacteria causing BV by antagonizing the growth and adhesion of pathologic&#xD;
      bacteria causing BV. In non-pregnant women, oral administrations of these strains of&#xD;
      lactobacilli are safe, and reduce the risk of BV by restoring predominant lactobacilli, the&#xD;
      normal vaginal bacterial flora.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacterial vaginosis is associated with increased incidence of preterm delivery. For pregnant&#xD;
      women, restoration of lactobacilli in the genital tract could be very important to prevent BV&#xD;
      and may lower the risk of preterm labor. At present, the safety, tolerability and efficacy of&#xD;
      lactobacilli use during pregnancy is not well known for the fetus and the pregnant women. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to do a phase I trial to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy&#xD;
      of oral lactobacilli on vaginal flora of pregnant women and follow up their infants for any&#xD;
      side effect up to 6 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, treatment failure and recurrence of BV following anti-microbial treatment is&#xD;
      frustrating. During pregnancy, probiotics may be the next step to treat BV and restore normal&#xD;
      vaginal micro flora. But the safety of lactobacilli use during pregnancy is not established.&#xD;
      The investigators will do phase I trial to evaluate safety of oral lactobacilli in pregnant&#xD;
      women along with their infants up to 6 months.&#xD;
