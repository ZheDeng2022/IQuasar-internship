  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 50% of ICU patients suffer from Acute kidney injury (AKI). Metformin shows&#xD;
      protective properties in kidney disease. Our study aimed to validate AKI incidence among&#xD;
      diabetes patients in the ICU with or without preadmission metformin exposure. We included&#xD;
      non-AKI patients with type 2 diabetes in Medical Information Mart for Intensive Care&#xD;
      (MIMIC)-III database. Incidence of AKI and mortality were compared between those with and&#xD;
      without preadmission prescriptions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Emerged as a major public healthy problem, Acute kidney injury (AKI) is now influencing&#xD;
      millions of people worldwide and leading to reduced survival, increased progression of latent&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease (CKD), and even new onset of CKD. More than half of intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) patients underwent AKI in a recent multinational cross-sectional study, often&#xD;
      resulting in the need for renal replacement therapy with a high socio-economic impact for the&#xD;
      patients.The effective precaution and treatment strategy remains limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the most general and first-line biguanide antihyperglycemic drug, metformin has&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory characteristics and is related with decreased all-cause mortality compared&#xD;
      with other antihyperglycemics.. In some clinical trials and experimental studies conducted on&#xD;
      divergent rodent models representing various types of kidney diseases going from AKI to CKD,&#xD;
      metformin has been shown beneficial effects on the kidney. Moreover, preadmission metformin&#xD;
      exposure is associated with a lower rate of 28-day mortality among AKI patients showed in&#xD;
      several clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in critical care patients with type 2 diabetes, the evidence of preadmission&#xD;
      metformin usage decreasing a risk of AKI incidence is still absented. Therefore we performed&#xD;
      a retrospective cohort study to validate the association of preadmission metformin exposure&#xD;
      and AKI incidence in patients with diabetes in the ICU .&#xD;

        Type 2 diabetes patients without AKI were eligible in our study. AKI was defined according&#xD;
        to the Kidney Disease: Improving Global Outcomes (KDIGO) criteria. KDIGO criteria are as&#xD;
        follows: increase in SCr to ≥1.5 times baseline must have occurred within the prior 7 days;&#xD;
        or ≥0.3 mg/dl increase in serum creatinine (SCr) occurred within 48 h; or urine volume &lt;0.5&#xD;
        ml/kg/h for 6 h or more. The minimum of the SCr values available within the 7 days before&#xD;
        admission was used as the baseline SCr[12]. When the preadmission SCr was not available,&#xD;
        the first SCr measured at admission was used as the baseline SCr. The diagnosis of type 2&#xD;
        diabetes was based on International Classification of Disease, Ninth Revision (ICD-9). We&#xD;
        only included adult patients (age&gt;16 years).&#xD;
