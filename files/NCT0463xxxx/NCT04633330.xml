    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre, randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled study on female&#xD;
      participants with diagnosis of high-risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection to evaluate&#xD;
      the clearance capacity of AHCC®.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, cervical cancer is the fourth most common malignancy in women and a major cause of&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. It accounts for nearly 10% of all cancers. The etiology of cervical&#xD;
      cancer has been identified and confirmed associated with high risk-human papillomavirus&#xD;
      (HR-HPV). When HR-HPV infections persist overtime, patients have an increased risk of&#xD;
      developing cervical cancer The proprietary, a standardized extract of cultured Lentinula&#xD;
      edodes mycelia (ECLM), AHCC®, was developed in Japan in 1992. Several studies have reported a&#xD;
      variety of therapeutic effects, including antioxidant and anticancer activity and improvement&#xD;
      of immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As recently reported study on AHCC®, pre-clinical in vitro and in vivo evidence demonstrated&#xD;
      its durable clearance of HR-HPV infections. The preliminary data from the two pilot studies&#xD;
      suggested that AHCC® supplementation supports the host immune system for successful clearance&#xD;
      of HR-HPV infections. A confirmatory phase II randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      study is about completion. The preliminary results of this phase II study confirmed data&#xD;
      observed in pilot studies that AHCC® supplementation for at least 6 months is associated with&#xD;
      a 60% successful elimination of HPV infections and confirmed IFN-β correlates with clearance&#xD;
      of persistent HPV infections. The optimal duration of AHCC® supplementation required after&#xD;
      the first negative result still needs more evaluation in future clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, all above mentioned studies have included western participants solely. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to evaluate the clearance capacity of AHCC® on Chinese female participants&#xD;
      with diagnosis of HR-HPV infection.&#xD;

    <measure>High risk human papillomavirus (HR-HPV) infection testing, ROCHE, Cobas assay</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months for all participants since enrolment</time_frame>
    <description>The Cobas human papillomavirus (HPV) test is NMPA-approved for cervical and endocervical samples collected in PreservCyt (ThinPrep) media. The Cobas HPV test detects DNA of the high-risk types 16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, 66, and 68. This test does not detect DNA of HPV low-risk types (e.g., 6, 11, 42, 43, 44) since these are not associated with cervical cancer and its precursor lesions.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Interferon Beta Test-Plasma</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months and 6 months for all participants since enrolment, extra-6 month for responding participant from study arm, extra 3 months and 6 months for compensated participants from control arm.</time_frame>
    <description>Human IFN-β (Interferon beta) ELISA Kit will be applied for this test. This kit was based on sandwich enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay technology. Capture antibody was precoated onto 96-well plates. And the biotin conjugated antibody was used as detection antibodies. The standards, test samples and biotin conjugated detection antibody were added to the wells subsequently, and washed with wash buffer. HRP-Streptavidin was added and unbound conjugates were washed away with wash buffer. TMB substrates were used to visualize HRP enzymatic reaction. TMB was catalysed by HRP to produce a blue colour product that changed into yellow after adding acidic stop solution. The density of yellow is proportional to the target amount of sample captured in plate. Read the O.D. absorbance at 450nm in a microplate reader, and then the concentration of target can be calculated.</description>

  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Liquid based cytology test</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months for all participants since enrolment, extra-6 month for responding participant from study arm, and extra 6 months for compensated participants from control arm.</time_frame>
    <description>In this method, the cervical cells are immersed in a conserving liquid before being fixed on the slide, avoiding desiccation and reducing the quantity of obscuring material. Liquid cytology can be prepared by manual or automated methods, and various systems are commercially available. They are mostly used for cervical cancer screening but are also adapted for FNAC samples.</description>
