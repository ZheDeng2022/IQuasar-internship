  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When it comes to cardiovascular diseases, surgical or clinical treatment can be cited, and&#xD;
      cardiac surgery is considered a complex and large treatment where it involves important&#xD;
      organic repercussions that alter the physiological and hemodynamic mechanisms of patients,&#xD;
      which can lead to a critical state postoperatively, leading to possible complications that&#xD;
      require intensive care at that time. Respiratory complications usually occur frequently in&#xD;
      the postoperative period of these surgeries, causing a functional lung capacity to decrease&#xD;
      by up to 20%, which may result in atelectasis, pneumonia, pleural effusion, among others. For&#xD;
      this reason, physiotherapy usually plays an important role in the treatment of these&#xD;
      patients, as it helps to reduce or treat these complications, in addition to promoting motor&#xD;
      rehabilitation of patients before myocardial revascularization surgery. For this reason, this&#xD;
      study aims to compare the effect of conventional physiotherapy techniques with the management&#xD;
      of thoracoabdominal rebalancing in postoperative patients of coronary artery bypass graft.&#xD;
      This is a randomized pilot trial in which patients who underwent coronary artery bypass&#xD;
      surgery at the Institute of Cardiology of Rio Grande do Sul participate in the study.&#xD;
      Patients selected for the control group (conventional physiotherapy) will be exposed to&#xD;
      respiratory physiotherapy techniques such as vibrocompression, passive manual expiratory&#xD;
      therapy, acceleration of expiratory flow, fractional inspiration in times, diaphragmatic&#xD;
      breaths and aspiration when necessary, and patients selected for the intervention group, will&#xD;
      appear on the management of thoracoabdominal rebalancing as abdominal supports and / or in&#xD;
      the ileo-costal space, inspiratory aid, release of the scapular waist, thoracic swing,&#xD;
      release of the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles together with aspiration, if necessary.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Compare the effect of conventional physiotherapy techniques with the management of&#xD;
      thoracoabdominal rebalancing in postoperative myocardial revascularization surgery patients.&#xD;
      It is a randomized pilot trial in which patients who have undergone myocardial&#xD;
      revascularization surgery at the Institute of Cardiology of Rio Grande do Sul will&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include individuals over 35 years of age who have myocardial revascularization&#xD;
      surgery with prescribed physiotherapeutic treatment, and will be excluded from patients whose&#xD;
      patients were intubated and / or remained in mechanics for more than hours or, still, who&#xD;
      required non-invasive mechanical norms before or during the collection period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The work will be submitted to the Research Ethics Committee at the Cardiology Institute of&#xD;
      Porto Alegre (CEP-ICFUC). All study participants will receive clear explanations regarding&#xD;
      the research, and those who accept to participate in the study voluntarily, will sign the&#xD;
      informed consent form, in two copies, one being made available to the participant and the&#xD;
      other to researchers. Participants will not be paid, nor will they receive any assistance&#xD;
      during or after the end of the survey (466/12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of this research will be given in better conducts that prevent or reduce&#xD;
      complications and / or respiratory discomfort as well as accelerate the patient's recovery,&#xD;
      aiming at hospital discharge more quickly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients selected for the control group (conventional physiotherapy) will be exposed to&#xD;
      respiratory physiotherapy techniques such as vibrocompression, passive manual expiratory&#xD;
      therapy, acceleration of expiratory flow, fractional inspiration in times, diaphragmatic&#xD;
      breaths and aspiration when necessary, and patients selected for the group intervention, will&#xD;
      be submitted to the handling of the thoracoabdominal rebalancing as abdominal supports and /&#xD;
      or in the ileo-costal space, inspiratory aid, scapular waist release, thoracic swing, release&#xD;
      of the pectoralis major and deltoid muscles together with aspiration if any need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research presents minimal risk for the participants, which are related to the measurement&#xD;
      of variables and / or application of conventional physiotherapy techniques such as&#xD;
      vibrocompression, acceleration of expiratory flow, passive manual expiratory therapy that may&#xD;
      suggest some discomfort or pain when touching the chest in a sensation of pressure and&#xD;
      vibration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that patients submitted to the handling of thoracoabdominal rebalancing have&#xD;
      lower scores on the pulmonary complications scales, Downes and Raphaelly respiratory&#xD;
      discomfort scale and, consequently, show improvement in the other variables.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a pilot randomized clinical trial. The randomization technique for proposed proposals will be performed using a computer program (www.random.org) containing the coded distribution. The allocation confidentiality will be guaranteed by a randomization list that will be in a remote place, which will prevent the researcher from identifying which intervention will be specified by each patient. The generation of the sequence of numbers will be performed by a researcher &quot;blind&quot; to the study, after selection of the patients by the inclusion criteria. The sequence of numbers one used for randomization will be kept confidential until the exact moment of the beginning of the study. The randomization of the subjects in the proposed groups will be done in two blocks, in which the program will randomly distribute each new participant to one of the blocks: conventional physical therapy group and thoracoabdominal rebalancing group.</intervention_model_description>
