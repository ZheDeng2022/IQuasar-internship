  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross over study on 60 children&#xD;
      aged 5 to 25 years with severe spasticity related to cerebral palsy (CP), level IV and V with&#xD;
      full-spectrum medical cannabis product of CBD/THC ratio 10:1.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Test components:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Active: Full-spectrum medical cannabis with ratio of CBD:THC 10:1 (HemPhar)&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Placebo (both of the same producer)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Steps&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent should be signed by parents/caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Weight of the participant should be determined and an IV line inserted. The following&#xD;
           lab tests should be performed: CBC and differential counts, blood electrolytes,&#xD;
           magnesium, calcium, phosphorus, urea &amp; creatinine, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, gGT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ECG performed and analyzed&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A trained physiotherapist will perform the following motor assessments: spasticity level&#xD;
           according to modified Ashworth scale (Bohannon), function/activity assessment with the&#xD;
           use of Gross Motor Function Measure scale (GMFM-88) and assessment of muscle power with&#xD;
           dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Randomization of patients into one of the two arms of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Active substance or placebo are introduced thereafter (as an oral oily solution for oral&#xD;
           application) in a starting dose of 0.08 mg/kg body weight (BWt)/day divided in 2 doses&#xD;
           (the dose is according to the THC content). The dose is gradually increased, every 3&#xD;
           days for 0.08 mg THC/ kg BWt/day, until the maximum dose of 1 mg THC/kg BWt/day is&#xD;
           reached, or else until adverse effects are noted. It is expected that the average dose&#xD;
           will be 0.33 mg/kg BWt per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The parents/caregivers are given questionnaires/scales and also given oral instructions&#xD;
           on how to fulfil them (Edmonton scale, Borg scale and Global Impression of Change - GIC)&#xD;
           and the paper to take down notes on possible side/adverse effects while taking the&#xD;
           preparation (either active substance or placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. After 6 weeks of taking the substance or at the premature end of the study again the lab&#xD;
           tests will be performed as well as the motor assessment by the physiotherapist (as above&#xD;
           at inclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. In patients, who have been receiving placebo for the first 6 weeks, the active substance&#xD;
           is given for the next 6 weeks, as described above (under 6). The patients who have been&#xD;
           receiving the active substance for the first 6 weeks will continue to do so for the next&#xD;
           6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Additional blood samples are taken at 6 weeks in both groups for analysis of levels of&#xD;
           cannabidiol (CBD) as well as delta-9-tetrahydrocannbinol (THC) - around 4 ml of blood&#xD;
           for determination of both levels at time(s) after ingestion: 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 and 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. At the end of the study (after 12 weeks) again repeat:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. CBC and differential counts, blood electrolytes, magnesium, calcium, phosphorus,&#xD;
                urea &amp; creatinine, liver enzymes (AST, ALT, gGT)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Motor assessments by a physiotherapist (Ashworth/Bohannon, GMFM 88, dynamometer)&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Pharmacokinetics: 4 ml of blood for determination of phamacokinetics after&#xD;
                ingestion of the last dose (as in point 10 above)&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. Evaluation of the questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: if severe side/adverse effects are noted, the test compound should be stopped&#xD;
      immediately. If mild/moderate side/adverse effects are noted, the test component should be&#xD;
      gradually stopped: for 0,08 mg/kg BWt/day, every 3 days.&#xD;

    <description>A trained physiotherapist will assess Gross Motor Function Measure (GMFM-88) which is commonly used in the evaluation of gross motor function in children with cerebral palsy&#xD;
The Gross Motor Function Measure-88 (GMFM-88) is a standardized observational instrument developed to measure change in gross motor function over time. The test consists of 88 items categorized in five dimensions (Dimension A: lying and rolling, Dimension B: sitting, Dimension C: crawling and kneeling, Dimension D: standing and Dimension E: walking, running and jumping). The test was conducted as described in the GMFM-88 manual . A percentage score as compared to maximum is calculated for each dimension and for the total score of the five dimensions.&#xD;
Reference curves exist for GMFM-88 for each age group.&#xD;
Floor score is 4 (minimum score / worst), ceiling score (maximum score / best) is 75.</description>
