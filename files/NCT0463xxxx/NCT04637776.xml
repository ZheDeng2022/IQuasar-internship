  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a common and debilitating chronic disease with a poor prognosis. Many&#xD;
      patients with HFhave psychiatric problems such as depression and other medical disorders such&#xD;
      as lung or kidney disease.This study will examine the effects that these psychiatric and&#xD;
      medical disorders have on HF outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 6.2 million Americans have heart failure (HF) and the prevalence is increasing&#xD;
      rapidly. HF is a common cause of hospitalization and mortality in older adults, and the cost&#xD;
      of hospital care for HF is skyrocketing. One reason why HF is so burdensome and costly is&#xD;
      that it is often complicated by cardiovascular and noncardiovascular comorbidities,&#xD;
      especially in older patients. Psychiatric and medical disorders that are risk factors for&#xD;
      incident HF persist after HF has developed, and additional comorbidities accumulate as&#xD;
      patients with HF grow older. Thus, HF is embedded within a larger pattern of multimorbidity.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, most trials of HF therapies as well as many other studies of HF have excluded&#xD;
      patients with complex psychiatric and medical comorbidities or severe cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      This has left large gaps in research on the care of older adults with HF. In addition,&#xD;
      research on socioeconomic risk factors and health disparities has not been integrated with&#xD;
      research on multimorbidity in HF. Heart failure is only one of multiple challenges facing&#xD;
      patients with multimorbidity, stressful socioeconomic circumstances, and psychosocial&#xD;
      problems, but the fragmentation of research on HF has left us with little understanding of&#xD;
      patients with complex psychosocial problems. The purpose of this study is to identify&#xD;
      combinations of comorbidities and health disparities may affect HF outcomes and require&#xD;
      different mixtures of medical, psychological, and social services to address. It will&#xD;
      encompass both psychiatric and medical comorbidities but will emphasize the role of&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidities. Syndemics theory is a useful framework for studying this type of&#xD;
      psychosocial and medical complexity. Syndemics, also known as synergistic epidemics, occur&#xD;
      when there are adverse interactions between prevalent disorders that concentrate in&#xD;
      populations that are vulnerable due to adverse socioeconomic or environmental conditions. The&#xD;
      syndemics framework has yielded important insights into a number of other disorders, but it&#xD;
      has not been used to study the complex psychosocial problems of patients with HF. To our&#xD;
      knowledge, this will be the first study of the syndemics of psychiatric and medical&#xD;
      comorbidities in heart failure. The multimorbidity framework is an alternative approach for&#xD;
      investigating the effects of multiple comorbidities on health outcomes. The specific aims of&#xD;
      the study are: 1) to determine the coprevalence of major psychiatric and medical&#xD;
      comorbidities in patients with HF (n=535); 2) to determine whether coprevalent comorbidities&#xD;
      have synergistic effects on all-cause readmission and mortality risks, heart failure&#xD;
      self-care, and perceived global health; 3) to identify vulnerable subpopulations of patients&#xD;
      with HF who have higher coprevalences of syndemic comorbidities compared to less vulnerable&#xD;
      subpopulations; 4) to determine the extent to which syndemic comorbidities explain adverse HF&#xD;
      outcomes (readmissions and mortality, poor self-care, and poor perceived health) in&#xD;
      vulnerable subgroups of patients with HF; and 5) to determine the effects of multimorbidity&#xD;
      on readmissions, mortality risk, self-care, and quality of life.&#xD;
