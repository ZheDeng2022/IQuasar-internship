      This prospective single arm double-blind study approved by the Ethics Committee of the&#xD;
      institution, will be conducted on at the Oncology Institute of Vojvodina in Sremska Kamenica,&#xD;
      Serbia. Patients with colo-rectal cancer liver metastases (CRLM) is presented to the&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team (MDT).Screening and enrolment is conducted after established of&#xD;
      indication for resection. The surgeons assesses resection margin (RM) for every resected&#xD;
      liver specimen (RLS) intra-operatively by inspection and palpation. These data will be&#xD;
      compared with pathological RM examination as a &quot;gold standard&quot;. Resection margin of 1 mm or&#xD;
      more will be rated as negative RM (RM-) otherwise RM is positive (RM+). Taking the result of&#xD;
      the pathohistological examination as &quot;gold standard&quot; it is determined that RM is true&#xD;
      positive when the pathologist and surgeon agreed that the RM is positive. False negative RM&#xD;
      is when the surgeon assesses RM as negative and pathologist as positive. The sensitivity of&#xD;
      the surgical assessment of RM+ is defined as the rate of RM+ which was correctly identified.&#xD;
      True negative RM is determined when the pathologist and surgeon agreed that it is negative&#xD;
      RM. False positive RM defined when the surgeon assessed RM as positive, but pathologist found&#xD;
      that it was RM-. The specificity of the surgical assessment of RM is defined as the rate of&#xD;
      RM- which is correctly identified. Total accuracy represents the rate of correctly recognized&#xD;
      positive and negative RM, relative to the total number of samples. Agreement between surgeon&#xD;
      and pathologists finding will be analyzed as well as difference between them. Disease&#xD;
      recurrence and disease-free survival (DFS) will be analyzed by RM.&#xD;
