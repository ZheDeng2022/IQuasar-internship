    <measure>Ease of Use: Provider Review of the Investigational Device and Standard of Care</measure>
    <time_frame>Immediately after rewarming, up to 90 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Providers will report ease of use of the rewarming modalities by completing a survey. The survey consists of two questions requesting providers to indicate ease of use of 1) the device and 2) Standard of care (manual water bath) on a scale from 1-10, where 1 indicates easy and 10 indicated difficult.</description>

Sous Vide Device (SVD): A basin will be filled to the marked line with water from jugs at room temperature, for each frozen extremity. The sous vide device (SVD) will be attached to the distal edge of the basin. The SVD will be turned on and set to maintain the bath at a constant 38 degrees celsius for 30 minutes duration. The thermometers will be powered on continuously and the researcher will record temperatures simultaneously from each thermometer every 2 minutes. At the end of the 30 minute treatment, the SVD will be powered off and the extremity assessed by the researcher for warmth and pliability. If the extremity still feels cold or frozen, an additional 30 minutes in the water bath will commence, with subsequent reassessment. Rewarming will be considered complete when the affected tissue becomes red or purple, soft, and pliable.</description>

        <title>Ease of Use: Provider Review of the Investigational Device and Standard of Care</title>
        <description>Providers will report ease of use of the rewarming modalities by completing a survey. The survey consists of two questions requesting providers to indicate ease of use of 1) the device and 2) Standard of care (manual water bath) on a scale from 1-10, where 1 indicates easy and 10 indicated difficult.</description>
