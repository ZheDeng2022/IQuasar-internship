  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II study evaluates the safety and efficacy of OH2 in patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced/metastatic pancreatic cancer who have failed first-line standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OH2 is an oncolytic virus developed upon genetic modifications of the herpes simplex virus&#xD;
      type 2 strain HG52, allowing the virus to selectively replicate in tumors. Meanwhile, the&#xD;
      delivery of the gene encoding human granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF)&#xD;
      may induce a more potent antitumor immune response.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      OH2 injection ≤ 4 mL, administered by intratumoral injection of EUS-FNA, administered on the&#xD;
      first day of the first cycle, every 3 weeks thereafter, administered on the 1st day of each&#xD;
      cycle ± 3 days, continuous administration does not more than 6 treatment cycles.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Have received at least first-line or more systemic chemotherapy and failed. The&#xD;
             definition of failure: Receiving first-line systemic chemotherapy means having used&#xD;

             progression or toxic side effects are intolerable, and there must be imaging evidence&#xD;
             or clinical evidence to prove the disease progression. For neoadjuvant/adjuvant&#xD;
             therapy (chemotherapy or radiotherapy), if disease progression occurs during treatment&#xD;
             or within 6 months after stopping treatment, it should be counted as a failure of&#xD;
