    <textblock>
      Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, as our overarching conceptual&#xD;
      framework, this translational 2 Â½ year pragmatic RCT uses a clustered, stepped wedge design&#xD;
      to test the effectiveness of a school-based (unit of analysis) implementation strategy&#xD;
      (project intervention) called RISE (Return to Learn Implementation bundle for schools) on&#xD;
      evidence-based practice (RTL protocol implementation; main outcome) and student outcomes&#xD;
      (i.e., days to RTL start after diagnosis) after youth concussion. The central hypothesis is&#xD;
      that schools in the intervention condition receiving the RISE implementation bundle (toolkit&#xD;
      plus school support) will have more complete and sustainable RTL protocols, and better&#xD;
      student outcomes compared to schools in control condition who receive only written RTL&#xD;
      protocol information. As rural and low SES schools are particularly likely to struggle to&#xD;
      implement RTL protocols,19,25 we specifically examine RISE implementation and barriers to&#xD;
      implementation related to school demographic characteristics related to health equity. The&#xD;
      school characteristics we examine are rurality, primary language, racial and ethnic mix, and&#xD;
      free/reduced-cost lunch.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      As you are aware, COVID caused us to consider how to complete this project and answer the&#xD;
      scientific questions posed in the Specific Aims. The investigators considered shifting the&#xD;
      RTL project to a later time and switching with another project but this would not have worked&#xD;
      for the other project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To solve this challenge of impact of school changes, the investigators convened with the&#xD;
      project advisory board for consultation, consulted the research core at HIPRC and contacted&#xD;
      the participants who were to have been participants in the randomized controlled trial. 19 of&#xD;
      the 24 schools responded. From this work, the investigators agreed that since the school&#xD;
      context has changed to either home online or hybrid mode, that students with concussion who&#xD;
      are the recipients of the intervention should not be deprived of an intervention that is&#xD;
      potentially beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have therefore made the following adaptations that retained the specific&#xD;
      aims and central hypothesis that school context capacity can be strengthened to provide&#xD;
      tailored student-centered RTL care and improve outcomes for students with a concussion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the investigators are considering &quot;school&quot; wherever students are receiving an&#xD;
      education. The investigators will recruit subjects who are currently largely coordinating&#xD;
      education due to COVID, work with their schools, and recruit nationally. These adaptations&#xD;
      will require a sample size of a total of 150 high school students with recent concussion (75&#xD;
      intervention [Group A: RISE bundle + CDC information], 75 controls [Group B: CDC information&#xD;
      only]) who will be recruited using social media and other platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some advantages to this design: 1) The investigator's intervention materials will&#xD;
      now be able to be translated to Spanish due to adaptations, 2) This project will reach more&#xD;
      particpants in rural and from disadvantaged backgrounds, 3) Communications between&#xD;
      particpants and schools will be enhanced.&#xD;
