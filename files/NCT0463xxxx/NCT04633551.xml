  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women who had an adverse pregnancy outcome (APO), such as preeclampsia, preterm birth, or&#xD;
      gestational diabetes, have a higher risk for heart disease. Some of the extra risk for heart&#xD;
      disease after APOs is thought to be caused by inflammation. Investigators will randomize&#xD;
      women who had an APO in the past 3 years to receive an anti-inflammatory supplement or serve&#xD;
      as a time control. Investigators will compare blood pressure, arterial stiffness, blood&#xD;
      vessel reactivity, and blood markers of inflammation between women who did and did not&#xD;
      receive the supplement. Investigators will determine women's attitudes about taking a dietary&#xD;
      supplement and measure whether the participants who receive the supplement take all or most&#xD;
      of the doses.&#xD;

      Research Design. Investigators will invite 56 women with an APO within the past 3 yrs to&#xD;
      participate. Women will be randomly assigned to the 4-wk intervention group (n=28) or a&#xD;
      standard care group (n=28) using a computerized random number generator, stratified by race.&#xD;
      Assuming up to 25% with poor adherence, Investigators expect that 42 women (21 each arm) will&#xD;
      complete the study. No data exist related to effects of supplementation on vascular function&#xD;
      in our population, we assumed a medium effect size, i.e. Cohen's d~0.50 and accepting a&#xD;
      β=0.80, to generate sample sizes. Generation of effect sizes is a key outcome of this study.&#xD;
      Investigators will conduct a vascular assessment and blood draw at two visits: before the&#xD;
      intervention begins and within 3 days of completing the intervention. Investigators will&#xD;
      conduct visits during the early follicular phase of menstrual cycle to account for&#xD;
      fluctuating hormones. Vascular testing will be performed in the supine position and ≥4 hours&#xD;
      after a light meal. Surveys for Aim 2 will be completed within the first 2 weeks of study&#xD;
      enrollment, and interviews for Aim 2 will be conducted at the end of Visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti-inflammatory supplementation intervention. Participants randomized to the&#xD;
      supplementation intervention will receive a commercially available supplement (100 mg&#xD;
      curcumin phytosome, 100 mg quercetin phytosome, 100 mg green tea phytosome, 100 mg&#xD;
      trans-resveratrol, 100 mg trans-pterostilbene). Participants will be asked to take 2&#xD;
      doses/day (1g total). Participants randomized to supplementation will receive a daily email&#xD;
      reminding them to take the supplement. Covariates. Medical history, age, and&#xD;
      sociodemographics will be obtained via self-report. Investigators will use validated surveys&#xD;
      to determine physical activity, sedentary behavior, and smoking history. Height and weight&#xD;
      will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability of Dietary Supplementation. Investigators will administer surveys to all&#xD;
      participants to understand their perceptions of dietary supplementation, including potential&#xD;
      benefits and consequences associated with supplementation. Investigators will determine&#xD;
      willingness to use supplements, barriers to supplementation, and who, i.e., physician or&#xD;
      partner, influences their decision to use dietary supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence and Barriers to Adherence. Investigators will count pills to determine adherence to&#xD;
      supplementation regime. Investigators will assess each intervention participant's perceptions&#xD;
      of supplementation with a brief interview at the final visit. Interviews will capture&#xD;
      participant's perceptions of the role of supplementation for CVD prevention, and any side&#xD;
      effects of supplementation. Investigators will ask participants to recommend ways to&#xD;
      encourage participation and ask questions regarding their perceptions of the incentive&#xD;
      structure and contact with the study team. Investigators will contact participants who drop&#xD;
      out of the study to identify reasons for drop out.&#xD;
