      septic shock is the first cause of mortality in intensive care unit. Innate immunity is the&#xD;
      body's first line of defense against pathogens&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      since their discovery, inflammasomes have an important role during inflammatory response&#xD;
      following an aggression. There are intracytoplasmic multiprotein complex activated by&#xD;
      cellular stress or infections and is responsible for the release of pro-inflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, including IL-1Î². One study focused on the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in&#xD;
      monocyte during sepsis has shown its early alteration that is correlated with mortality. Most&#xD;
      studies have analysed inflammasomes in nucleated cells, nevertheless, little is known about&#xD;
      inflammasomes in platelets. The aim of the study is to analyze the activation of NLRP3&#xD;
      inflammasome in platelets and leukocytes during sepsis, from patients hospitalized in&#xD;
      intensive care unit compare to a control group, until its resolution to better understand the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of sepsis&#xD;
