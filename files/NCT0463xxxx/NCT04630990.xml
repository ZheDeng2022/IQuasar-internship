  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is an abnormal, estrogen-dependent growth of endometrial tissue outside the&#xD;
      uterus that frequently results in dysmenorrhea and pelvic pain and often causes infertility.&#xD;
      Endometriosis is a significant burden on the quality of life of women. This study will assess&#xD;
      the tolerability and how effective elagolix is in changing the disease symptoms in adult&#xD;
      female participants with endometriosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elagolix is an approved drug for treatment of endometriosis. Adult female participants with a&#xD;
      diagnosis of endometriosis, who are prescribed elagolix by their physicians, in accordance&#xD;
      with local clinical practice and label will be observed for up to 24 months. Around 80 female&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled in the study in Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive Elagolix as prescribed by their physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be a higher burden for participants in this study compared to standard of care.&#xD;
      Patients report outcomes, in the form of questionnaires will be collected up to 24 months&#xD;
      prospectively to assess the impact of elagolix on quality of life.&#xD;
