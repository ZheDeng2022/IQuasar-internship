  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The project aims to test the clinical effectiveness of the Mom´s Supporting Moms&#xD;
      intervention, a newly developed approach to the prevention of postpartum depression (PPD) and&#xD;
      to determine its cost-effectiveness. The approach consists of online screening for risk of&#xD;
      PPD in obstetric settings, and subsequent remote peer support intervention for women at risk&#xD;
      of PPD development. As a preparation for proposed study, investigators have developed the&#xD;
      Mom´s Supporting Moms intervention which is based in mother-to-mother delivered&#xD;
      psychoeducation, basic procedures of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness, shared&#xD;
      personal experience with postpartum depression and, if necessary, referring to a professional&#xD;
      consultation. Proposed study will allow investigators to bring missing Czech methodological&#xD;
      procedures for the early screening of PPD development risk, and for subsequent&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention. Further, investigators will be able to present economic&#xD;
      data on proposed intervention to relevant stakeholders in mental health policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve these aims, investigators will 1) set up a screening program in five Czech&#xD;
      maternity hospitals 2) conduct a randomized controlled trial (n= 60 per each arm), and 3)&#xD;
      conduct a cost-effectiveness analysis of the Mom´s Supporting Moms intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will test the following primary hypotheses: H1: Mom´s Supporting Moms&#xD;
      intervention will decrease depressive symptoms in women at risk of PPD development. Secondary&#xD;
      hypotheses: SH1: Mom´s Supporting Moms intervention will reduce anxiety symptoms in women at&#xD;
      risk of PPD development. SH2: Mom´s Supporting Moms intervention will increase women's&#xD;
      health-related quality of life. SH3: Mom´s Supporting Moms intervention is cost-effective in&#xD;
      comparison to treatment as usual.&#xD;

      RELEVANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although PPD is a widespread problem that complicates not only women´s life, but also the&#xD;
      development of the infant, which has long-term consequences on their future health and&#xD;
      well-being, the vast majority of affected women are left untreated. PPD has been increasingly&#xD;
      recognized as a major public health issue and there is a growing sense of urgency to identify&#xD;
      approaches to better manage it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Czech Republic, however, women themselves, their children and society do not benefit&#xD;
      from decades of basic research on complex negative effects of postpartum mood disorders as&#xD;
      the knowledge obtained from it has not been translated into a systematic intervention. The&#xD;
      care of women facing postpartum mental disorders is fragmented in the Czech Republic and is&#xD;
      not addressed systematically by a step-by-step approach. Further, there is no system in the&#xD;
      Czech Republic for the prevention of perinatal mental disorders in women, which also plays a&#xD;
      preventive role in the development of mental disorders in the children of these mothers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening Phase - identification of women at risk of PPD development Participants:&#xD;
           Consenting women who will give a birth in maternity hospitals (Mělník, Neratovice,&#xD;
           Bulovka, Thomayer, and Olomouc).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention: An online psychosocial risk screening software, which investigators pilot&#xD;
           tested, will be actively offered in cooperating maternity hospitals. Consenting women&#xD;
           will complete the online screening form, running on the servers of the National&#xD;
           Institute of Mental Health, secured against cybercrime, before participants will leave&#xD;
           the maternity hospital (day 3-4 after delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The screening instrument consists of the Edinburgh Postpartum Depression Scale - EPDS,&#xD;
           Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale - PASS, and the Perinatal Psychosocial Profile - PPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main domain of interest is the presence of depressive symptoms (EPDS), the secondary&#xD;
           domains are the presence of anxiety symptoms (PASS) and the presence of psychosocial&#xD;
           stress (PPP).&#xD;
&#xD;
           After completing the screening form, participants with an EPDS score &lt;10 will be sent an&#xD;
           automatic email thanking participants for participating in the study and informing them&#xD;
           of a low risk of developing PPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If a participant scores ≥ 10 in the EPDS, participant will be considered as at risk of&#xD;
           PPD development (Knights et al., 2016), and an automatic email inviting these women in&#xD;
           the Intervention phase will be sent to these participants based on automated&#xD;
           randomization (allocation 1:1, experimental:control):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. for the experimental group with the information that, based on the screening&#xD;
                results, participants have higher risk of mental discomfort, and that participants&#xD;
                will be contacted by a peer consultant within 2-3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. for the control group with the information that participants have a higher risk of&#xD;
                mental discomfort according to the screening, and therefore investigators attach&#xD;
                information on how to proceed if participants want to actively seek care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The screening result of each woman with EPDS ≥ 10 who will be randomized to the&#xD;
           intervention group will be also sent to the peer support coordinators so that the&#xD;
           coordinator can connect the woman with the peer consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Specific situation in screening: Question EPDS 10: I had thoughts of hurting myself. If&#xD;
           a participant answer - Yes, very often.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants screening will be evaluated as high-risk and participant will be&#xD;
           automatically connected with a peer coordinator who will offer her a professional&#xD;
           psychiatric / psychological consultation. If that situation occurs, it will be properly&#xD;
           recorded, and participant will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intervention Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
           - a randomized controlled trial. Participants: women at risk of PPD identified through&#xD;
           the Screening Phase of the proposed study. Criteria for inclusion in the Intervention&#xD;
           Phase: EPDS score ≥ 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Intervention: Mom´s Supporting Moms - remote peer support. At least 4 times telephone&#xD;
           contact (or contact via another telecommunication channel, according to the study&#xD;
           participant's preference - Skype, Zoom, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, etc.) between the&#xD;
           research participant and a peer consultant trained by the National Institute of Mental&#xD;
           Health - Czech Republic. Within peer support, the main method is listening,&#xD;
           psychoeducation, basic procedures of cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness,&#xD;
           shared personal experience with PPD and postpartum anxiety disorders and, if necessary,&#xD;
           referring to a professional consultation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comparison: usual postpartum care consisting of gynecology check-ups which are in the&#xD;
           Czech Republic predominantly focused on somatic health. Women have to actively seek for&#xD;
           help if they need mental health care. Participants from the control group, who will seek&#xD;
           themselves the Mom´s Supporting Moms intervention will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization: automatized randomization of all participants identified in the Screening&#xD;
           Phase as being at risk of PPD development to experimental arm (Mom´s Supporting Moms&#xD;
           intervention) or to control arm (usual postpartum care), allocation 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA) - economy analysis of the Mom´s Supporting Moms The&#xD;
           CEA result provides information on the cost per unit of health benefit. Economic&#xD;
           evaluation is strictly comparative, and its purpose is always to compare the results of&#xD;
           at least two alternative treatment approaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For this reason, CEA's outputs are always relative and measure the change in costs&#xD;
           (incremental costs) and change in benefits (incremental effects) given by using one&#xD;
           alternative instead of another. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is&#xD;
           defined as the change in the average costs of an alternative divided by the change in&#xD;
           average benefits, and very often investigators compare a new treatment with an existing&#xD;
           treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The costs of the monitored treatment strategies are obtained by weighing the services&#xD;
           provided to the patient for the year of monitoring by their price, i.e. by multiplying&#xD;
           the quantity of the provided service by the unit value of the given service. The Czech&#xD;
           Republic has rich national registers of administrative data on the use of health&#xD;
           services. In 2016, the National Register of Paid Health Services (NRHZS) was newly&#xD;
           established, which collects data on the use of inpatient and outpatient services and on&#xD;
           the consumption of medicines by all insured persons. Investigators will calculate the&#xD;
           final prices on the basis of the payment decree. The value of the peer intervention will&#xD;
           be quantified and included in the ICER calculation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Linking a clinical dataset to registry data: To perform the CEA, investigators will link&#xD;
           clinical data from the intervention part of the study with data from the NRHZS, which&#xD;
           has been managed by the Institute of Health Information and Statistics of the Czech&#xD;
           Republic since 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Analytic plan Primary outcome is the between group (experimental arm vs. control arm)&#xD;
           difference in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale in week 6. Investigators will use&#xD;
           ANCOVA test (difference in post- intervention score wit baseline score as covariate) to&#xD;
           test the effect of intervention on the self-reported depressive symptoms.&#xD;
           Intention-to-treat analysis will be used with the last value observed carried forward&#xD;
           method used for missing observations. Investigators will adjust for confounders&#xD;
           (possibly: age, marital status, childbirth complications, psychosocial stress) if&#xD;
           between group differences in these variables will be observed. For the secondary&#xD;
           outcomes (Perinatal Anxiety Screening Scale - anxiety symptoms and AQoL-8D - quality of&#xD;
           life) investigators will use similar statistical approach as described in the analytic&#xD;
           plan for the primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The between group differences in the distribution of mental disorders assessed by the&#xD;
           MINI interview postintervention (week 6, month 3 after randomization) will be tested by&#xD;
           the chi-square tests and presented as the RRs with 95% CI. Exploratory analysis:&#xD;
           Investigators will use a repeated measures analysis using a linear mixed model to assess&#xD;
           the trend of the examined outcomes over the period of 3 months. The interaction effect&#xD;
           of group and time will be used to assess the differences over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CEA: The effectiveness Mom´s Supporting Moms will be measured by the&#xD;
           quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) determined by the AQoL-8D data measured baseline,&#xD;
           week 6, month 3 and year 1 after randomization. Investigators will use the standard area&#xD;
           under the curve method to calculate QALYs. The estimation of costs of health-care&#xD;
           services and medication use will be done according to appropriate Czech payment decree.&#xD;
           Further, investigators will divide differences in costs during the follow-up period&#xD;
           between the two groups by differences in QALYs to estimate the incremental&#xD;
           costeffectiveness ratio (ICER). Then the cost-effectiveness plane will be produced&#xD;
           (i.e., a diagram with difference in QALYs on the horizontal axis and difference in costs&#xD;
           on the vertical axis displaying the central cost-effectiveness estimate and the&#xD;
           uncertainty in terms of these two dimensions). Finally, investigators will calculate the&#xD;
           cost-effectiveness acceptability curve that, in our case, will shows the estimated&#xD;
           probability that intervene by Mom´s supporting Moms is cost-effective given the sampling&#xD;
           uncertainty. A regression approach will be used for our analyses if any confounders will&#xD;
           be detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Power analysis - estimated for our primary outcome According to previously published&#xD;
           studies, the effect of peer support in reducing the rate of self-assessed depressive&#xD;
           symptoms is moderate. The sample size is calculated so that investigators can detect a&#xD;
           medium-sized intergroup difference on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (effect&#xD;
           size 0.6) at a power of 80% and a significance level of 5% (2-sided). Thus, with the&#xD;
           power analysis set in this way and a potential drop out of 30%, the minimum file size&#xD;
           included in the intervention part of the study is 120 women (60 for each group).&#xD;
