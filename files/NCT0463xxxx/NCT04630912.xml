  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia is a condition that causes cognitive decline beyond normal ageing. Anxiety and&#xD;
      depression are very common in people with dementia, but their needs are often&#xD;
      under-recognised and under-served. Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT) can reduce anxiety&#xD;
      and depression by increasing psychological flexibility, the ability to pursue a meaningful&#xD;
      life, in spite of unpleasant thoughts or feelings. There is much to learn about if and how&#xD;
      ACT works for people with dementia, and whether it could be an effective psychological&#xD;
      therapy for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three participants with a dementia diagnosis and clinically-significant levels of anxiety&#xD;
      and/or depression will be identified by their GP or Memory Assessment Service (MAS) in&#xD;
      Nottinghamshire. Participants will attend 12 weekly, 90-minute sessions of ACT with the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator (PI), accompanied by their caregiver if they so wish. In session,&#xD;
      participants will complete several short questionnaires to measure their anxiety and&#xD;
      depression, goals for therapy, psychological flexibility and relationship with the therapist.&#xD;
      One week after the final session, an independent researcher will meet with participants and&#xD;
      their carers to discuss their opinions of therapy and any changes to their anxiety and/or&#xD;
      depression. One and three months after therapy, participants will be sent two short&#xD;
      questionnaires to measure their current anxiety and depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information gathered from the independent researcher and questionnaires will be used to&#xD;
      develop a case record for each participant, which will be looked at by independent&#xD;
      psychotherapy experts to see whether ACT was effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being funded by Health Education England and is expected to last one year in&#xD;
      total. Participant duration will last about 7 months. The study will form a Doctoral Thesis&#xD;
      at the University of Nottingham and will be submitted to a peer-reviewed journal for&#xD;
      distribution.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will involve a small case series of up to six participants (three people with&#xD;
      dementia and up to three caregivers depending on the person with dementia's preference),&#xD;
      meaning the PI will be able to track on an individual level. Individuals who express interest&#xD;
      will be contacted by the student via telephone or email. The PI will provide information&#xD;
      pertaining to all aspects of study participation prior to recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure &amp; Intervention Content,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the practitioner-researcher model, the PI will be delivering the ACT intervention&#xD;
      following the completion of ACT training and pre-adaptational work for use with people with&#xD;
      dementia. Verbal information may be supported by visual aids and written information to&#xD;
      support retention and reminders of any between-session tasks. Although there is no specific&#xD;
      protocol for ACT with dementia, a published ACT protocol, 'Better Living with Illness'&#xD;
      (Brassington et al., 2016), will be used flexibly to guide the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HSCED will include baseline and intervention phases. As participants will be recruited to&#xD;
      the study at different times, baseline lengths will vary. This may strengthen the design by&#xD;
      reducing the possibility of any observed changes being attributed to time-based effects&#xD;
      (after a duration of monitoring).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be delivered on an individual basis for up to 90-minute, weekly&#xD;
      sessions. There will be a standard number of up to 12, but this will be reviewed at session&#xD;
      six. At the beginning of each therapy session, the PI will offer introductions, provide&#xD;
      reminders about the purpose of the study, confidentiality and its limits and gain verbal&#xD;
      consent to proceed. Reported changes will also be captured at the beginning of each session,&#xD;
      for example, 'checking-in' with participants and inviting them to share any reflections on&#xD;
      therapy or changes they have noticed between sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACT fidelity will be assessed by the PI using the ACT Fidelity Measure (O'Neill, Latchford,&#xD;
      McCracken &amp; Graham, 2019). The ACT-FM is a 25-item coding system that captures depth and&#xD;
      frequency of coverage of major ACT components and non-adherent components through four main&#xD;
      areas within ACT; Therapist Stance, Open Response Style, Aware Response Style and Engaged&#xD;
      Response Style.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline (first session), last session and at 1 and 3-month follow-ups, participants&#xD;
      (people with dementia) will complete self-report measures of anxiety (with the GAD-7) and&#xD;
      depression (with the PHQ-9). At each session and at 1 and 3 month follow-ups, they will also&#xD;
      complete measures of wellbeing (Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale; SWEMWS),&#xD;
      personal problems (Personal Questionnaire; PQ), psychological flexibility (Comprehensive&#xD;
      Assessment of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy Processes; CompACT-SF) and a measure of&#xD;
      relational process (Session Rating Scale; SRS) to support their rich case record and provide&#xD;
      data on the quality of the therapeutic alliance as a rival hypothesis for interventional&#xD;
      change. It will be considered whether any of these measures could be completed by the PI from&#xD;
      session recordings to try to reduce participant burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week post-therapy, a semi-structured Change Interview will be conducted with participants&#xD;
      and their caregivers together by an independent researcher to obtain their views about their&#xD;
      experience of therapy, including change processes, consideration of what they attribute&#xD;
      change to and what may have enabled or hindered change, if change occurred. These will likely&#xD;
      take place at a room at one of the universities, location convenient for the participant or&#xD;
      remotely via telephone or videocall. The interviews will be audio-recorded with a digital&#xD;
      dictation device for later transcription by the student to contribute to the rich case record&#xD;
      of each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Practical Aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to COVID-19, there will be two options for intervention delivery: (A) face-to-face as&#xD;
      planned; or (B) remotely via telephone or videocall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Option A, the PI will offer flexibility regarding the location and time of the ACT&#xD;
      intervention. It is understood that people with dementia are often marginalised, therefore&#xD;
      the PI will make efforts to travel to them and make any reasonable adjustments. Participants&#xD;
      may be telephoned to prompt or remind them of the therapy start time if necessary. Location&#xD;
      options will include participants' homes, NHS site or University premises, depending on the&#xD;
      preferences of the participant. All therapy sessions will be conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
      University of Nottingham's (UoN) and respective NHS Trust's Lone Working Policies. The&#xD;
      attendance of caregivers at therapy sessions will be negotiated with the participant. There&#xD;
      is an acknowledgement of caregivers' likely role in transporting and accompanying&#xD;
      participants to their appointments. All attendees (PI, participant and caregiver) will be&#xD;
      required to wear Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and adhere to social distancing measures&#xD;
      in accordance with COVID-19 restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Option B, the PI will negotiate an appropriate appointment time (between 9am-5pm on&#xD;
      weekdays) to conduct the intervention. Again, the attendance of caregivers at therapy&#xD;
      sessions will be negotiated with the participant. There is an acknowledgement that caregivers&#xD;
      may prompt or support clients with between session tasks. Caregivers will also be invited to&#xD;
      Change Interviews following the completion of therapy. The Change Interviews will involve&#xD;
      asking participants about their experience of the therapy, what they found helpful and less&#xD;
      helpful, any improvements that could be made and asking both participants and carers whether&#xD;
      they have noted any changes in wellbeing or functional ability over the intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All therapy sessions will be audio-recorded with an encrypted, digital dictation device for&#xD;
      storage and later transcription for quality and ACT fidelity checks. This will be clarified&#xD;
      on the Participant Information Sheet and at the beginning of each therapy session. The PI&#xD;
      will also take written notes.&#xD;
