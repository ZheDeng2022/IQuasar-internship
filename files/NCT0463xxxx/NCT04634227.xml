  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients who have a diagnosis of locally advanced, unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic soft tissue or bone sarcoma (except gastrointestinal stromal tumors and Kaposi's&#xD;
      sarcoma) from any site.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this pilot study are to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      pharmacokinetically-guided, patient-individualized dosing and to obtain preliminary evidence&#xD;
      of anti-tumor activity of intravenous ascorbate in combination with gemcitabine to inform a&#xD;
      subsequent Phase II trial. Soft tissue and bone sarcomas will be studied as different cohorts&#xD;
      given the differences in biology and historical responses to single agent gemcitabine in&#xD;
      these disease types. As such, 10 evaluable patients per disease cohort will be included.&#xD;

    <measure>Determine the 12 weeks progression free survival (PFS 12) at 12 weeks post treatment initiation</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of interest is PFS12 defined as the proportion of patients without progressive disease per RECIST 1.1 at 12 weeks after treatment initiation. A sample size of 10 evaluable patients per disease cohort (soft tissue and bone) will allow for the estimation of PFS12 per the 90% exact confidence intervals as follows:&#xD;
PFS12 Exact 90% confidence interval:&#xD;
1/10 10% (1-39%); 2/10 20% (4-51%); 3/10 30% (9-61%); 4/10 40% (15-70%); 5/10 50% (22-78%); 6/10 60% (30-85%); 7/10 70% (39-91%); 8/10 80% (49-96%); 9/10 90% (61-99%);</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess overall survival of patients with unresectable or metastatic soft tissue and bone sarcoma treated with high dose ascorbate when administered intravenously concurrently with gemcitabine</measure>
    <time_frame>Every 2 months for first 6 months, then every 3 months up to 2 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Time from start of therapy (day 1, cycle 1) to death.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Determine the tumor response as per RECIST 1.1 criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Tumor response will be defined using the RECIST 1.1 guidelines as below&#xD;
Complete response is the disappearance of all target lesions; Any pathological lymph nodes ( whether target or Non-target) must have reduction in short axis to &lt;10mm.&#xD;
Partial response is a 30% decrease in the sum of the longest dimension (LD) of target lesions, relative to baseline measurement;&#xD;
Progressive disease is an increase of 20% or more in the sum of the LD of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum on study. The sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.Or appearance of a new malignant lesion.&#xD;
Stable disease is a decrease in tumor size of less than 30% or increase of less than 20%.</description>

    <description>Ascorabte is administered on Days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16 of a 28-day cycle. Gemcitabine will be administered on Days 1, 8 and 15, after the infusion of ascorbate. Concomitant treatment will continue for 6 cycles. Patients whose disease has not progressed while receiving gemcitabine and ascorbate and who are tolerating therapy may continue either single agent gemcitabine or concomitant treatment beyond 6 cycles at the discretion of the investigator. Treatment will be terminated with progression of disease. Disease will be assessed by CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis or MRI of the lesion every 2 cycles for progression.</description>

    <description>Following 15g test dose, 75g administered 75g dose on days 1 and 2. Further doses of ascorbate will be determined by serum ascorbate levels measured by the end of the week to reach a target serum concentration between 20 -30 mM. Ascorbate doses will continue to be escalated until either the target serum concentration or maximum dose of 125 g is administered.</description>
