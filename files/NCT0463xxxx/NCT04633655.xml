      This is an observational study of chemotherapy-induced peripheral neurotoxicity (CIPN)&#xD;
      patients to be investigated prospectively in order to assess responsiveness of a set of&#xD;
      outcome measures in an international multi-center study.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be performed at all participating centers and will consist of the following&#xD;
      assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Core study (assessments at baseline and at the end of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard oncology assessment per local site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NCI-CTC v.5 sensory and motor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PRO-CTCAE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PI-NRS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NPS-CIN&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EORTC CIPN20©&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FACT-GOG NTX v.4©&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TNSn©&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PGIC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OXA-NQ&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extended study (at all available sites - any combination of assessment methods is allowed,&#xD;
      minimum at baseline and at the end of treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EORTC CIPN15&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CIPN-R-ODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TNSc© at the same time points as for questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OXA-NQ (also at mid-treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  nerve conduction study of the radial (motor and sensory), ulnar (motor and sensory),&#xD;
           sural, dorsal sural and common peroneal nerves (*)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  QST (*)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum for biomarkers search (*)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DN4&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Within a multi-center international collaboration among experienced neurologists,&#xD;
      oncologists, nurses and symptom scientists, the principal aim of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      responsiveness of a set of outcome measures for CIPN evaluation in order to define the gold&#xD;
      standard for its assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of CIPN will be performed at different levels of investigation. The Core study&#xD;
      will allow the evaluation of subjects with common devices, so that an assessment can be&#xD;
      performed at any medical site (expected time for questionnaires completion 15 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Extended study will add any combination of the listed assessment methods/biological&#xD;
      sample collection, in order to ascertain whether this approach can provide a more careful and&#xD;
      clinically-relevant estimate of the peripheral nervous system damage. Comparison between&#xD;
      healthcare evaluation and subjects' report of CIPN severity using established questionnaires&#xD;
      will be performed in both Core and Extended studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The primary aim for this study is to test responsiveness of the different assessment&#xD;
      methods used in the core study, in a multi-center, multi-regional International setting,&#xD;
      comparing changes from baseline to end of treatment. Secondary aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate responsiveness (changes from base line to end of treatment) also of the&#xD;
           other outcome measures used in the Extended Study;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate mid-treatment data predictiveness of end of treatment neurological status&#xD;
           for each outcome measure;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate recovery rate/modification of the neurological status for the follow up&#xD;
           evaluations (3/6/12/24 months after treatment), stratifying data for different drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: 1000 patients who are candidates for neurotoxic chemotherapy for any cancer&#xD;
      with non-investigational drugs (including immune checkpoint inhibitors and &quot;targeted&quot; drugs)&#xD;
      will be enrolled from participating centers. A trained investigator in each participating&#xD;
      center will perform the selected healthcare-assessed scales and supervise the&#xD;
      patient-completed measures as presented in Table 1. Subjects will be examined at least at&#xD;
      baseline and end of treatment (Core Study) and at additional intermediate and follow-up&#xD;
      timepoints (Extended study), according to their treatment plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatments: There are no study-specified treatments, as subjects will receive only&#xD;
      their standard of care chemotherapy. The investigators will not influence decisions regarding&#xD;
      treatment duration nor supply medication for this study. However, all treatment regimens will&#xD;
      be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participating Centers minimum requirements: Participating Centers should:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. accept the study protocol and have their participation approved by a local Ethics&#xD;
           Committee/Institutional Review Board&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. have access through an internet connection to the secure server located at the main site&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. guarantee the proper assessment of the selected patients at least at the Core study&#xD;
           level&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. have the potential to recruit at least 30 patients/year&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. have the capacity to upload the data collected from each patient within 1 week&#xD;

          2. Male and female subjects who are 18 years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects freely provide informed consent by signing and dating an informed consent&#xD;
             form prior to study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects must be willing to complete all study-related activities and follow-up visits&#xD;
             required by the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects must have a Karnofsky performance score greater than or equal to 70.&#xD;
             Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects presenting with any of the following will not be included in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Poor prognosis, with high probability to be unable to complete the planned&#xD;
             chemotherapy treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Concomitant neurologic conditions (e.g., brain tumor, spinal or brain metastases) that&#xD;
             would interfere or complicate the assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Severe depression that in the opinion of the Investigator would complicate the&#xD;
             assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Chronic treatment with antiepileptic drugs, antidepressants and major analgesics,&#xD;
             unless stable dosing and conditions have been reached for 3 months prior to entry.&#xD;

          5. Preventive interventions (e.g., antioxidants, cryotherapy, distal pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who are currently receiving another medication other than antineoplastic&#xD;
             chemotherapy drugs that has known potential to produce neurologic peripheral nerve&#xD;
             toxicity (e.g. metronidazole, isoniazid, amiodarone, antiretroviral medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with any other condition, which, in the investigator's judgment, might&#xD;
             decrease the chance of obtaining satisfactory data to achieve the objectives of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Previous neurotoxic chemotherapy.&#xD;
