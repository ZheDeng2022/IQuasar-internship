    <textblock>
      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After stroke, most patients suffer from hemiparesis with variable functional consequences&#xD;
      that can strongly impact autonomy in daily activities. Motor recovery is, therefore, an&#xD;
      essential part of the therapeutic strategy in order to optimize the patient's capacities and&#xD;
      functional autonomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some authors suggest that trunk control would be essential in the capacities of standing&#xD;
      balance, transfer tasks and gait. However, no studies have tested the reliability and&#xD;
      validity of proprioceptive and sitting balance clinical tests for patients with post-stroke&#xD;
      hemiparesis. These tests would be very useful in advancing our understanding of trunk&#xD;
      impairments and for clinicians to manage an appropriate treatment strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to assess the reliability of the Trunk Positional Sense Test, the&#xD;
      unstable sitting test with forceplate and the Modiﬁed Functional Reach Test (MFRT) in&#xD;
      individuals with post-stroke hemiparesis. The secondary objectives is 1) to assess the&#xD;
      validity of the Trunk Positional Sense Test and the unstable sitting test with forceplate, 2)&#xD;
      to assess the validity of a phone inertial captors to assess the instable sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method. - Thirty-two individuals with subacute post-stroke hemiparesis will be included in&#xD;
      this study. After clinical tests (trunk strength, Balance Assessment in Standing and Sitting,&#xD;
      Timed Up and Go test), the MFRT, Trunk Positional Sense Test and unstable sitting will be&#xD;
      evaluated by two physiotherapists in a ﬁrst session (inter-rater reliability). After a rest&#xD;
      of 2-4 h, a second similar session was conducted with the first physiotherapist (intra-rater&#xD;
      reliability). For unstable seated balance, two tools will be used: the force platform and a&#xD;
      smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability will be tested by calculating the intraclass correlation (ICC) and Bland-Altman&#xD;
      analysis. For trunk positional sense test and unstable sitting test, the validity will be&#xD;
      tested with correlations with each clinical test. The validity, between forceplate variables&#xD;
      and inertial phone variables, will be tested with correlations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives. - The promotion of quality tests to assess patients in clinical practice is&#xD;
      essential. The results of this study should provide knowledge for selecting the best trunk&#xD;
      control tests to assess the individuals after stroke and to understand the influence of trunk&#xD;
      control on functional activities.&#xD;

    <description>The inter-rater reliability will be evaluated by comparing the test results of two physiotherapists administering the same tests (Trunk position sense, Modified Functional Reach Test, unstable sitting on a seesaw), and the intra-rater reliability will be evaluated by comparing the test results of two sessions (test-retest) which will be executed by the same tester, with the intra-class correlations coefficient (ICC) and Bland-Altman analysis.</description>

    <description>The BASS is a test to assess static and dynamic sitting and standing balance, which has been validated for post-stroke hemiparetic patients. Each test is evaluated by a score from &quot;0&quot; (patient needs external support) to &quot;4&quot; (stable without external help) for static condition and from &quot;0&quot; (no possibility to pick up objects) to &quot;3&quot; (objects picked up without external help) for dynamic condition. The maximal score (sitting, standing, static and dynamic) is 14 points.</description>
