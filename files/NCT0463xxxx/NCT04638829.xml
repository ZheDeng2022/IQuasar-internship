      This Phase 4, prospective, multi-center, open-label study will evaluate safety, platelet&#xD;
      count, and subject reported medication satisfaction in adult subjects with chronic ITP after&#xD;
      switching to avatrombopag from eltrombopag or romiplostim. At least 100 subjects will be&#xD;
      enrolled, 50 (±10) who have received eltrombopag and 50 (±10) who have received romiplostim&#xD;
      for at least 90 days prior to study entry.&#xD;

    <description>Safety and Tolerability of Avatrombopag given for 90 days after stopping eltrombopag or romiplostim&#xD;
The incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events(SAE) and adverse events of special interest will be summarized for all enrolled subjects using counts and percentages. Treatment-emergent AEs and SAEs will be summarized overall, by system organ class, and by preferred term. AESIs will be summarized by event type (thromboembolic events and bleeding events). In addition, treatment-emergent AEs will be summarized by severity and by relationship to study drug.&#xD;
Bleeding events reported during the study will be summarized by WHO grade.</description>
