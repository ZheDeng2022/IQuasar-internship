  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major health care problem) whose cardiac symptoms often overlap&#xD;
      with panic attack (PA) symptoms. This pattern of comorbidity is important because it may&#xD;
      delay accurate diagnosis, influence medical decision making, compromise physician-patient&#xD;
      relationship, and reinforce illness behaviors. Clarifying the temporal relationship between&#xD;
      panic and AF symptoms may create opportunities for more effective disease management&#xD;
      programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to characterize the temporal relationship between PA symptoms&#xD;
      and AF episodes using a real-time assessment data capturing system that has methodological&#xD;
      advantages over retrospective designs in previous research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local cardiology practices will be screened for patients aged 21-60 years with paroxysmal AF&#xD;
      for PA symptoms. Patients with AF indicating on the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ) a&#xD;
      history of PA and experiencing at least one PA in the previous 4 weeks will be eligible. A&#xD;
      formal diagnosis of panic disorder is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty individuals will be enrolled for 4 weeks, during which they will wear an external&#xD;
      cardiac event monitor for continuous rhythm monitoring. A mobile internet based application&#xD;
      will allow participants to complete a panic episode report when they experience PA symptoms.&#xD;
      They will record the time and duration of each episode, fear, and the PA symptoms. At end of&#xD;
      day, participants will record their daily emotions, AF and PA symptoms, and health behaviors.&#xD;
      Daily reminders for episode and daily reports with be sent via text message. Cardiac&#xD;
      monitoring data, evening reports, and panic episode reports will be assessed by research&#xD;
      staff daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim is to examine the correspondence of PA and AF episodes. A time-lagged&#xD;
      hierarchical model with repeated measures will examine whether panic episodes immediately&#xD;
      precede or follow episodes of AF (i.e., within 4 hours). Power to detect an effect was&#xD;
      estimated based on Monte Carlo studies run in MPlus. Based on findings that anxiety attacks&#xD;
      are associated with a 4-time greater likelihood of episodes of AF, we estimated an effect&#xD;
      size of ÃŸ=.25. For episodes as infrequent as 3 out of 14 days on average (150 total&#xD;
      observations) statistical power exceeds .80.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that a percentage of individuals will show a temporal relationship between&#xD;
      their PA symptoms and AF episodes and that this temporal relationship will differ among&#xD;
      patients with disparate, but distinct, psychological/medical profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings may be informative for cardiologists treating AF patients who experience PA symptoms&#xD;
      and may suggest effective disease management programs that help patients self-manage&#xD;
      anxiety-related AF symptoms. The study will also provide pilot data on the utility of our&#xD;
      assessment procedures for use in larger more comprehensive externally funded studies.&#xD;
