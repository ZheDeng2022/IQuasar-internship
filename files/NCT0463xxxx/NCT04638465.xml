  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects, good and/or bad, of treating&#xD;
      participants with HPV-mediated oropharyngeal cancer, with less treatment, using the new&#xD;
      staging system. The investigators believe this treatment will provide the same effectiveness&#xD;
      as the usual treatment, but decrease the side effects. The radiation doses, chemotherapy&#xD;
      doses, and the type of surgical approaches that will be used in this treatment protocol have&#xD;
      all been previously investigated. Previous research suggests that this can be done safely,&#xD;
      but there has not been a study done basing treatment on the new staging system.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Ultrasound guided Fine-needle aspirate (FNA) of the known site of disease with the&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Human papilloma virus (HPV); p16 Immuno-Histo-Chemical Staining. If negative, complete&#xD;
             high risk HPV Fluorescence in-situ Hybridization (FISH).&#xD;
