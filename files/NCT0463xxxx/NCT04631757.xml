    <textblock>
      This is a study of Camrelizumab in Combination With concurrent radiotherapy and SOX for&#xD;
      Initial Unresectable or potentially resectable proximal Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction&#xD;
      (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma. Patients without prior palliative therapy will be treated with&#xD;
      Camrelizumab, radiotherapy (total 45 Gy), Oxaliplatin, and S-1. The primary endpoint is the&#xD;
      1-year PFS rate.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab plus&#xD;
      Concomitant Chemoradiotherapy in patients with Initial Unresectable or potentially resectable&#xD;
      proximal Gastric or Gastroesophageal Junction (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma. 33 participants with&#xD;
      Initial Unresectable locally advanced proximal gastric carcinoma /Gastroesophageal Junction&#xD;
      (GEJ) Adenocarcinoma (Siewert type II/III) will be treated with conversion therapy as below&#xD;
      once recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. induction chemotherapy (3w): one cycle of camrelizumab 200mg q3w and SOX regimen&#xD;
           (oxaliplatin 130mg/m2, d1, Q3w + S-1 40-60mg bid, d1-d14,Q3w);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. after the induction, concurrent Chemoradiotherapy will be started (5-6w): intensity&#xD;
           modulated radiotherapy was given for tumors and high-risk lymphatic drainage areas,&#xD;
           total dose:45Gy/25d, 1.8Gy/d, camrelizumab 200mg q3w, S-1 40-60mg bid, d1-d14, Q3w. The&#xD;
           resectability assessment will be performed followed by MDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants still unresectable will receive additional conversion therapy with&#xD;
           camrelizumab and SOX regimen. The resectability will be evaluated every 6 weeks until&#xD;
           resectable or up to 8 cycles of conversion therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resectable patients will receive D2 resection.&#xD;

    <description>An AE was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which did not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE could therefore be any unfavourable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product or protocolspecified procedure, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product or protocol-specified procedure. Any worsening of a pre-existing condition that was temporally associated with the use of the Sponsor's product was also an adverse event. The number of participants who experienced an AE was reported for each arm according to the treatment received. The grade of AE will be assessed per CTCAE 5.0.</description>
