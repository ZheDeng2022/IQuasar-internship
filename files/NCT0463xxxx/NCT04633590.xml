  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The physically inactive lifestyle of industrialised nations combined with the overconsumption&#xD;
      of energy dense food has led to a global health emergency with &gt;650 million adults classified&#xD;
      as obese and ~400 million cases of type 2 diabetes worldwide. Physical inactivity is one of&#xD;
      the leading global risks for mortality due to its association with cardio-metabolic&#xD;
      pathologies such as cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Cognitive dysfunction is an&#xD;
      important comorbidity of diabetes that affects well-being and diabetes management. Despite&#xD;
      overwhelming evidence that an inactive lifestyle leads to chronic disease and premature&#xD;
      death, many fail to meet activity guidelines. Therefore, novel strategies are urgently needed&#xD;
      to combat the rising rates of metabolic disease and cognitive decline in our aging&#xD;
      population. Inspired by current trends in the fitness market, Sphery Ltd. developed an&#xD;
      immersive and motivating fitness exergame, the &quot;ExerCube&quot;. The ExerCube allows a full-body&#xD;
      workout that concurrently challenges physical and cognitive functions and adapts to the&#xD;
      fitness and skill level of the individual. Previous research has shown that the ExerCube is&#xD;
      an effective training method that is more enjoyable than conventional exercise training.&#xD;
      Development of a home-based version of the ExerCube has the potential to make this system&#xD;
      available to more individuals, and reduce major barriers to exercise, providing an attractive&#xD;
      means to improve cardio-metabolic health of the population. Innovative home-based exergames&#xD;
      are particularly in demand given the increase in the number of people wanting to exercise at&#xD;
      home. Here, the investigators will combine the expertise of an interdisciplinary team of game&#xD;
      researchers, game designers, exercise physiologists and metabolic researchers to further&#xD;
      develop and evaluate a home-based version of the ExerCube that is designed to improve&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic and cognitive health while effectively removing barriers to exercise in&#xD;
      individuals at elevated risk of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes is a global public health emergency with ~463 million cases worldwide which is&#xD;
      projected to reach ~578 million by 2030. This is associated with a huge financial burden, as&#xD;
      12% of global health expenditure is spent on diabetes treatment and its associated&#xD;
      complications. In addition to the obesity crisis, society faces an increasingly ageing&#xD;
      population, and the number of people affected by dementia is expected to triple within the&#xD;
      next 30 years. The increase in age-related cognitive decline and neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
      such as Parkinson's or Alzheimer's disease has important health and social implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regular physical activity slows the progression of type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular events&#xD;
      due to the beneficial effects on body weight, insulin sensitivity, glycaemic control, lipid&#xD;
      profile, endothelial function and aerobic capacity. In addition, cardiorespiratory fitness is&#xD;
      inversely associated with cognitive decline and dementia. Despite overwhelming evidence that&#xD;
      an inactive lifestyle leads to chronic disease and premature death, many adults fail to meet&#xD;
      physical activity guidelines. Clearly, new strategies are urgently needed to increase&#xD;
      physical activity participation in the increasingly sedentary population to combat the rising&#xD;
      rates of metabolic disease and cognitive decline in our ageing population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changing behavioural and environmental factors including urbanization, mechanization and&#xD;
      increased motorized transport are largely responsible in addition to a number of common&#xD;
      exercise barriers. Lack of time is cited as the main barrier to exercise, as many individuals&#xD;
      feel that increasing work hours and family commitments mean they cannot achieve the physical&#xD;
      activity guidelines. Other common barriers within the general population include limited&#xD;
      access to facilities and appropriate equipment, difficulty with transportation, inadequate&#xD;
      financial resources, bad weather and lack of motivation. In an attempt to overcome many of&#xD;
      the aforementioned barriers to exercise, members of the investigators' research group&#xD;
      developed a virtually-monitored exercise intervention that used simple on-the-spot bodyweight&#xD;
      exercises, that could be performed in the participant's home without supervision or&#xD;
      equipment. This home-based intervention was designed to be a practical and effective training&#xD;
      strategy capable of producing metabolic and functional adaptions while removing many of the&#xD;
      common barriers to exercise uptake and adherence such as &quot;intimidating&quot; gym environments,&#xD;
      difficulty with access to facilities, travel time and financial constraints were eliminated.&#xD;
      However, although these studies demonstrated success, more engaging exercise strategies are&#xD;
      needed to increase engagement in the sedentary population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inspired by current trends in the fitness market, Sphery Ltd. developed an immersive and&#xD;
      motivating fitness exergame, the &quot;ExerCube&quot;. The ExerCube allows a full-body workout that&#xD;
      concurrently challenges physical and cognitive functions and adapts to the fitness and skill&#xD;
      level of the individual. Previous research has shown that the ExerCube is an effective&#xD;
      training method that is more enjoyable than conventional exercise training. Development of a&#xD;
      home-based version of the ExerCube has the potential to make this system available to more&#xD;
      individuals, and reduce major barriers to exercise, providing an attractive means to improve&#xD;
      cardio-metabolic health of the population. Innovative home-based exergames are particularly&#xD;
      in demand given the increase in the number of people wanting to exercise at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the urgent need to develop effective and engaging&#xD;
      home-based exercise options, with a number of governments worldwide implementing strict&#xD;
      lockdowns and the closing of sports facilities. The restricted access to sports facilities&#xD;
      and sports clubs has made bodyweight exercises done at home the only viable option for many.&#xD;
      This trend in home-based exercise and long distance personal training is likely to continue&#xD;
      following the pandemic. Development of an attractive and effective home-based exergaming&#xD;
      system as the investigators propose here is likely to have increasing social and societal&#xD;
      importance in the future.&#xD;

    <description>As suggested in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) position statement on exercise and diabetes (Colberg et al., 2016) the aim of this session will be to create an individualised exercise programme tailored to the specific needs of each participant. Participants will be given a specific gym induction with a gym instructor at a dedicated gymnasium in the Bern area (Migros Fitnessclub). During this session the training will be adapted to the participants needs. As suggested in the ADA position statement on exercise and diabetes the aim of the program will be for the participants to engage in at least 150 min of moderate to vigorous intensity exercise (defined as a HR of 50-70% HRmax) or 75 min of vigorous intensity (defined as a HR of 70-85% HRmax) or interval training per week by the end of the program. Participants will be encouraged to train 3 times per week. Participants will also be advised of the benefits of resistance training.</description>
