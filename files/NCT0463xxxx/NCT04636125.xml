  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) is an anaerobic aerotolerant bacteria commonly isolated during&#xD;
      revision shoulder surgery. It is increasingly recognized as a pathogen, mainly in&#xD;
      implant-related infections. As an anaerobe, it usually needs a prolonged culture incubation&#xD;
      time of up to 14 days for growth and the association between implant surgery and C. acnes&#xD;
      infection is not always obvious. Unfortunately, prolonged incubation also increases the risk&#xD;
      of false positive cultures in isolating organisms that may exist as a result of&#xD;
      contamination. Given high rates of positive C. acnes cultures in cases of both primary and&#xD;
      revision shoulder surgery, the ramifications of positive C. acnes cultures for clinical&#xD;
      decision making remains uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to prospectively study the efficacy and side-effect profile of&#xD;
      surgical treatment plus an oral antibiotic regiment for shoulder PJI with indolent organisms&#xD;
      (C. acnes and CNS).&#xD;
