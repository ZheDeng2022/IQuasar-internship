      Background: Clinical heart failure patients always suffering from (1) worsen symptoms such as&#xD;
      decreased activity tolerance, end-to-end breathing and excessive body fluid volume; (2) high&#xD;
      medical expenses results from hospitalization; (3) reduced quality of life . In 2018,&#xD;
      following instruction from National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA), the National&#xD;
      Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH) undertook National Health Insurance post-acute care&#xD;
      program, PAC in charge of heart failure patients by multi-disciplinary integrated to reduce&#xD;
      acute exacerbations(AE), control symptoms, improve quality of life and increase survival&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate the outcome of patients with heart failure who been taken are of&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary integrated instructed by National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Use retrospective case contrl study. Adopted the hospitalized patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with heart failure in the NTUH as the research sample, and collected the retrospective data&#xD;
      for analysis in a two-group study design. (1) The experimental group is a patient who was&#xD;
      managed by the NHIA 's acute post-care plan. Provide interdisciplinary comprehensive care in&#xD;
      accordance with the norms and conduct health education during hospitalization. Hospitalized&#xD;
      Chinese pharmacists, dietitians, physiotherapists and case managers participate in health&#xD;
      education and will continue to be interviewed and have heart consultations within six months&#xD;
      of discharge. (2)The control group received traditional health education in general care and&#xD;
      routine health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time of review: From February 2, 2018, the implementation of the National Health Insurance&#xD;
      Agency's acute post-care plan day to December 31, 2019, and continuous tracking of&#xD;
      effectiveness for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion conditions: (1) Age over20 years, (2) long-term dialysis, (3) unconsciousness, (4)&#xD;
      complete bed rest without self-care ability, (5) those with ventilator dependence, (6)&#xD;
      ventricular assist device (VAD) has been implanted, (7) heart transplants , (8) refused to&#xD;
      join the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The monitoring indicators: Hospitalization rate within 180 days, mortality rate within one&#xD;
      year , functional recovery, left ventricle ejection fraction (LVEF), NT-pro BNP, etc.&#xD;
