  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the work is to compare the efficacy of preoperative IV tranexamic acid and rectal&#xD;
      misoprostol in reducing blood loss in the elective cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In women undergoing elective cesarean section, is preoperative administration of IV&#xD;
      tranexamic acid better than rectal misoprostol in reducing blood loss?&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Verbal and written consent will be obtained before history taking All women will be&#xD;
                subjected to&#xD;
&#xD;
      History taking:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed clinical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Personal history:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Name, Age, Parity, Occupation, Residency, and Special habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Present history: History of onset, course, and duration of vaginal bleeding or bloody&#xD;
      vaginal discharge, presence of uterine contraction, PROM, IUGR, or any indication for&#xD;
      cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Obstetric history: History of previous abortion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Menstrual history: For estimation of gestational age using Naegele's rule, provided that she&#xD;
      had regular cycles for the last three months before she got pregnant and was not taking&#xD;
      contraceptive pills during this period and she was sure of her dates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Term pregnancy defined as delivery between 37 and 42 weeks of gestation. Gestational age will&#xD;

      other tocolytic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Family history: For consanguinity in the case of CFMF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full clinical examination (pulse, temperature, and blood pressure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General examination including blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, body mass&#xD;
           index, head&amp; neck examination, Bilateral lower limb examination, chest, heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Local clinical examination; assessment of maternal health, obstetric abdominal&#xD;
           examination for fundal level, fetal presentation, estimating fetal weight, and scars of&#xD;
           previous operations, uterine contraction if present, auscultation of FHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative investigations (Rh, CBC, HTC, Hb, Coagulation profile, fasting and&#xD;
           postprandial blood sugar, and complete urine analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ultrasonography examination: to assess the following data:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gestational age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fetal viability&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fetal presentation and EFW.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detection of any fetal congenital anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ensure that all inclusion criteria are present.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Check amniotic fluid index (the amniotic fluid index (AFI) will be estimated using&#xD;
           abdominal ultrasonography on the day of delivery or the day before delivery. The uterus&#xD;
           will be divided into four quadrants; the right and left quadrants will be defined by the&#xD;
           linea nigra, and the upper and lower quadrants will be defined by the umbilicus. The&#xD;
           maximum vertical diameter of amniotic fluid in each quadrant will be measured in&#xD;
           centimeters. The sum of these four quadrants will be used to calculate the AFI. The&#xD;
           volume of amniotic fluid in ml. will be estimated by multiplying the AFI by 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cesarean section will be done by a senior registrar who performed at least 300 cesarean&#xD;
      sections before the start of the study. All CS will be performed using spinal anesthesia; the&#xD;
      abdomen will be entered by Pfannenstiel abdominal incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The allotted sealed envelope (allocation concealment will be discussed later) will be taken&#xD;
      to the theatre and handed over to the anesthetist who will administrate the drug (TXA or&#xD;
      Misoprostol) or the placebo to the patient without telling neither the researcher nor the&#xD;
      patient the content of the envelope. With the induction of anesthesia, patients assigned to&#xD;
      group 1 will receive 1 gram of TXA (kapron®, Amoun, Egypt) 10 minutes before skin incision,&#xD;
      by slow intravenous injection over 10 minutes and preoperative placebo (4 tablets similar to&#xD;
      misoprostol in size and shape as peroxide) will be administrated rectally. (Tranexamic acid&#xD;
      injection will be prepared by diluting 1gm (10ml) TXA in 100 ml of normal saline.&#xD;
      Participants are assigned to group 2 will receive 800μg rectal misoprostol (Misotac®, SIGMA,&#xD;
      Egypt) immediately after urinary catheterization and before skin incision and preoperative&#xD;
      placebo (10 minutes before skin incision, 10 ml of distilled water ampoules or normal saline&#xD;
      by slow intravenous injection over 10 minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All women will receive 10 IU of oxytocin (syntocinon®, NOVARTIS) by slow intravenous after&#xD;
      cord clamping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sterilization and toweling of the patient then the standard technique of trans-peritoneal&#xD;
      lower segment cesarean will be adopted. The placenta will be removed by cord traction and&#xD;
      uterine compression. The uterus will be exteriorized and compressed during closure which will&#xD;
      be achieved by continuous unlocked sutures in 2 layers using 2/0 polyglactin suture and 1 cm&#xD;
      interval between sutures. The peritoneum and muscle will be closed by 2/0 polyglactin suture&#xD;
      and the sheath will be closed by 1/0 polyglactin, and the skin will be closed by subcuticular&#xD;
      suture using proline double zero suture in both groups. The estimation of blood loss will be&#xD;
      started after skin incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The linen towels will be weighted in (mg) with its cover before and after the operation&#xD;
           using a highly accurate digital balance and the difference in weight between dry and&#xD;
           soaked linen towels will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood loss during the operation will be calculated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volume of the contents of the suction bottle (ml) (A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in weight of linen towels (gm) (B) (weight of soaked linen towels (gm) - the&#xD;
           weight of dry linen towels (gm)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amniotic fluid volume (ml) (C).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  So, blood loss during operation (ml) = (A + B) - C.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allowable blood loss will be calculated for all women according to the underlying law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ABL= EBV x (Hi - Hf) / Hi&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hi = initial Hct Hf = final lowest acceptable Hct Estimated Blood Volume (EBV) EBV = weight&#xD;
      (kg) X average blood volume (75-85 ml/kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A trained nurse will be responsible for the collection of wound dressing placed in the&#xD;
           vulval area during the first 24 hours after surgery and the difference in weight will be&#xD;
           calculated. The overall blood loss will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The difference between preoperative and 24 hours postoperative in hemoglobin&#xD;
           concentration and hematocrit value will be measured to calculate allowable blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The need for additional uterotonics drugs will be given according to the attendant&#xD;
           consultant decision or a blood loss of more than 1000ml intraoperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Operative time, need for blood transfusion and side effects of study drug e.g. nausea,&#xD;
           vomiting, diarrhea will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the patients will receive non-steroidal anti-inflammatory preparation in the form of&#xD;
           (Rheumarene®) 75mg IM (one ampoule) immediately postoperative than one ampoule 12 hours&#xD;
           postoperative and the need for extra analgesics will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All the patients will receive prophylactic broad-spectrum antibiotics in form of&#xD;
           (Ceftriaxone®, Sandoz, Egypt) 1 gm./12 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Apgar score of the fetus at 1 and 5 minutes, the need for neonatal intensive care&#xD;
           unit (NICU) admission, and neonatal death will be assessed in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data will be collected, tabulated, and statistically analyzed by IBM computer using the&#xD;
           Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS version 24). Chi-square test will be&#xD;
           used to compare qualitative variables between groups and Fisher exact test will be used&#xD;
           instead of the Chi-square test when the expected cell count less than 5. The student&#xD;
           t-test will be used to compare the quantitative variables in parametric data. P-value&#xD;
           &lt;0.05 will be set signiﬁcant.&#xD;

    <masking_description>A double-blind study is one in which neither the participants nor the experimenters know who is receiving a particular treatment. This procedure is utilized to prevent bias in research results. Double-blind studies are particularly useful for preventing bias due to demand characteristics or the placebo effect. In a double-blind study, the investigators who interact with the participants would not know who will receive the actual drug and who will receive a placebo.</masking_description>
