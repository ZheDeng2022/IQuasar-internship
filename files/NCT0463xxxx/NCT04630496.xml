    <textblock>
      This research study is a Feasibility Study, which is the first-time investigators are&#xD;
      examining the use of a Fitbit by thoracic surgery patients over the age of 70 years-old&#xD;
      before surgery. The study is looking to see if patients can wear a wrist step-tracker and&#xD;
      keep a log of their daily step counts for one week. The study is looking to see if people are&#xD;
      willing to keep track of their daily steps, so in the future participants may be provided&#xD;
      with step-goals to achieve and their steps prior to surgery can be accurately measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study involves using a Fitbit tracker to record daily steps over the course of&#xD;
      1 week prior to scheduled surgery. Participants will be given a step tracker in clinic and&#xD;
      instructed on its use. During the 1 week period, participants will be called by a study team&#xD;
      to check on progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a week, participants will be asked to return the step-tracker and their log either at a&#xD;
      scheduled pre-surgery clinic visit or in the pre-operative area which ever comes first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;

After enrollment, participants will be provided a mobile device (Fitbit) to wear for tracking steps for 1 week prior to their scheduled surgery.&#xD;
Participants will keep a log of daily steps for the 1 week they are wearing the device and receive one progress check-in call during the week.&#xD;
The device and log will be turned in either on a pre-surgery clinic visit or on the day of surgery whichever comes first.</description>
