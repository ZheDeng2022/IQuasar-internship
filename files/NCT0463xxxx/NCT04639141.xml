    <textblock>
      CLINICAL ISSUE: Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are four times more likely to&#xD;
      suffer with functional gastrointestinal disorders (FGIDs) than their neurotypical peers. The&#xD;
      presence of FGIDs are linked to increased undesirable behaviour and ASD severity. Current&#xD;
      behavioural approaches for ASD therapy do not alleviate the high comorbidity of FGIDs within&#xD;
      this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: Dysfunction of the microbiome-gut-brain (MGB) axis has been implicated in&#xD;
      pathogenesis of both ASD and FGIDs. Probiotics and prebiotics can modulate the gut microbiome&#xD;
      and research has shown efficacy at improving gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms in children with&#xD;
      ASD and neurotypical (NT) children with FGIDs. Gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) has shown&#xD;
      utility in treating FGIDs in NT children and adults but has not yet been trialed in children&#xD;
      with ASD. Targeting therapies to address the dysfunction of the bidirectional MGB axis will&#xD;
      likely be more effective than either brain/behavioural or gut-based therapy alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS: A synbiotic (prebiotic + probiotic mixture) with combined GDH will be more&#xD;
      effective than a synbiotic alone at reducing GI symptoms in children with ASD aged 5.00 to&#xD;
      10.99 years over a 12-week period.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks, 24 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in GI symptom severity as measured by the 6-item gastrointestinal severity index (6-GSI). The 6-GSI assesses each GI symptom using a Likert scale of 0-2 (0 = nil/mild/infrequent; 1 = moderate/occasional; 2 = severe/frequent). Score range 0-12. Mild GI issues are defined as a score of under three and moderate or severe GI issues defined as a score of three or above.</description>

    <measure>ASD severity/behaviour</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in ASD severity scores as measured by the Aberrant Behaviour Checklist (ABC) questionnaire. The ABC consists of five subscales, including: 1) irritability (15 items); 2) lethargy/social withdrawal(16 items); 3) Stereotypic Behaviour (7 items); 4) hyperactivity/noncompliance (16 items); and 5) Inappropriate Speech (4 items). Each item is scored as 0=never a problem, 1=slight problem, 2=moderately serious problem, or 3= severe problem. The score range is 0-174, with a higher score indicating greater severity or difficulties.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in anxiety levels as measured by the Parent Rated Anxiety Scale - Autism Spectrum Disorder (PRAS-ASD) questionnaire. This is a 25-item tool using a Likert scale of 0-3 (0=none; 1=mild; 2=moderate; 3=severe). Score range 0-75, with higher scores indicating greater levels of anxiety.</description>

    <measure>Gut microbiome</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>

    <description>Includes the daily oral synbiotic (as pervious described) + a home-based therapy program.&#xD;
Home-based therapy program: based on the Manchester model of gut-directed hypnotherapy (GDH) adapted for use in children with ASD. The GDH core therapy focus areas will be relaxation, control of gut function and ego-strengthening.&#xD;
Schedule: daily use of a home-based audio recordings. The program will consist of six (6) therapy sessions/recordings over 12 weeks. Each recording (sessions 1 through 6) is to be used daily for a fortnight. Each session is approximately 15-20 minutes in duration.</description>
