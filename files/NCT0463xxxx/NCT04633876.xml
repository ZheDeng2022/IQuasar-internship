  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to understand the impact of lifestyle coaching on the risk&#xD;
      of future cardiometabolic disease, workability and self-assessed wellbeing. The data gathered&#xD;
      during the study helps in the future to better identify different focus groups for more&#xD;
      tailored interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two main stages: screening and coaching phase. Screening Aava and the&#xD;
      pension will recruit 2000 participants for screening from the employer companies. Screening&#xD;
      participants are invited to answer a wellbeing questionnaire (Aava Virta questionnaire, Work&#xD;
      Ability Index questionnaire) and give blood samples and physiological measurements, including&#xD;
      weight, height, waist circumference, neck circumference and blood pressure. All subjects&#xD;
      participating in screening will receive the results from wellbeing questionnaire immediately&#xD;
      and they receive the results from blood test within few weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of these 2000 screened persons, a total of 300 high-risk (according to ApoB/ApoA1)&#xD;
      individuals and 600 medium-risk individuals will be selected to participate in the coaching&#xD;
      phase. These participants are randomly split into treatment and control groups, so that&#xD;
      eventually 150 high-risk and 300 medium-risk individuals are placed in both groups.&#xD;
      Therefore, a total of 900 subjects carry forward to the coaching phase and in 1100 subjects&#xD;
      the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 900 subjects entering coaching phase receive home a Firstbeat Bodyguard 2 device with&#xD;
      instructions for performing Firstbeat wellbeing analysis. After the measurement the device is&#xD;
      posted back for analysis according to instructions. The results and feedback from this test&#xD;
      is received in the end of the study after the coaching phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Coaching phase Within the coaching groups, participants in the high-risk category&#xD;
      and treatment group undergo an individual coaching program. Participants in the medium-risk&#xD;
      category undergo a group coaching program with similar aims. Both coaching programs last 10&#xD;
      weeks during which there are 8 almost weekly coaching sessions at the subjects worksite or&#xD;
      near vicinity. Both coaching programs aim in reducing cardiometabolic risk factors and&#xD;
      improving subjective well-being. The topics of the lifestyle coaching are 1) nutrition, 2)&#xD;
      physical activity, 3) sleep and stress and 4) the long-term maintenance of lifestyle changes.&#xD;
      The aims and methods in each coaching topic is based on Finnish recommendations on the topic.&#xD;
      The coaching sessions include mostly discussions but in the sessions focusing more on&#xD;
      physical activity there are also sessions including activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the halfway (5 weeks) of coaching phase, a second blood sampling and Aava wellbeing&#xD;
      questionnaire are taken from all subjects (both coaching and control groups). In the end of&#xD;
      the coaching phase (10 weeks) blood samples, Aava wellbeing questionnaire, Work Ability Index&#xD;
      -questionnaire and physiological measurements are taken the last time. At this stage a second&#xD;
      Firstbeat analysis is also performed. BBI-15 questionnaire is administered before and after&#xD;
      the coaching phase. An open ended questionnaire regarding lifestyle change motivators and&#xD;
      experiences before, during and after the coaching phase is administered to all participants.&#xD;
      Also, a small subset (20 persons) of subjects takes in interviews to delve more detailed to&#xD;
      the experiences during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of coaching phase and study - start of feedback and analysis After the coaching phase has&#xD;
      ended and the subjects (coaching and their control groups) have received all the results&#xD;
      (wellbeing questionnaire, blood tests and Firstbeat results) for the study and feedback&#xD;
      sessions will be held for all. Willing subjects also receive the results from the gene test&#xD;
      in form of PRS scores ie. total genetic risk for three areas of health: heart disease, type 2&#xD;
      diabetes and obesity. THL gene results do not identify single gene variants. After this&#xD;
      feedback session the study has ended for the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all data in the study has been gathered starts the analysing and reporting phase for&#xD;
      the researchers. At this stage the researchers can retrieve data from Aava patient records to&#xD;
      analyse the effect of earlier diagnoses and findings. The information retrieved relate to&#xD;
      ICD-10 diagnosis codes C00-C97 (malignant neoplasms), E00-E89 (endocrine, nutritional and&#xD;
      metabolic diseases), F00-F99 (mental, behavioral and neurodevelopmental disorders), I00-I99&#xD;
      (diseases of the circulatory system) and M00-M99 (diseases of the musculoskeletal system and&#xD;
      connective tissue) as these diagnostic codes can be important background factors for&#xD;
      biomarkers of CVD and Type 2 diabetes risk and to some of the secondary endpoints like&#xD;
      workability.&#xD;
