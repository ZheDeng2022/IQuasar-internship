  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will develop and test quality measures for and a facilitation model to help&#xD;
      addictions treatment clinics increase use of medicines for opioid use disorders, retain&#xD;
      clients longer in care, and help more people move into successful recovery. At the end of the&#xD;
      project, we will have developed specific training and coaching protocols as well as&#xD;
      electronic clinical support tools to guide quality improvement that can be disseminated&#xD;
      within New York and the rest of the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test a clinic-level intervention that uses external facilitators to provide&#xD;
      guidance to addictions clinics and contain three key components: 1) training on data driven&#xD;
      management; 2) training and guidance on patient-centered care and OUD medication; and 3)&#xD;
      electronic tools for shared decision making and patient progress monitoring.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There will be 4 sources of data examined in this study: 3 at the patient level and 1 at the&#xD;
      staff level. The sources of patient data include: 1) State administrative data from all&#xD;
      clients receiving treatment at the enrolled clinics (~7,950); 2) a subsample (1,200) who will&#xD;
      be recruited directly from the clinics to complete patient-reported outcome assessments, and&#xD;
      3) treatment progress data for clients will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For our administrative source of data, a final study population of approximately 7,950&#xD;
      individuals who are receiving treatment in the 30 enrolled outpatient treatment clinics for&#xD;
      OUD is anticipated. Clinics will be located in the New York City metropolitan region&#xD;
      (including Nassau, Westchester, and Rockland counties) and the Capital Region (including&#xD;
      Albany, Rensselaer, Saratoga, Montgomery, Schenectady, and Schoharie counties). Staff at each&#xD;
      enrolled clinic will also be interviewed and surveyed.&#xD;
