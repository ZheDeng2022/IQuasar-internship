  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will look to evaluate the feasibility of a backwards downhill running program as&#xD;
      an option for the treatment of Achilles tendinopathy in runners. It is known that exercise on&#xD;
      the Achilles tendon during elongation (eccentric exercise) improves tendon function after&#xD;
      injury. However, during recovery, the patient is required to stop tendon-loading activities&#xD;
      such as jumps and sprints. Therefore, during recovery, athletes decline in physical fitness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Backward running on a negative slope can achieve a biomechanical load similar to eccentric&#xD;
      exercise without decreasing physical fitness.&#xD;

      The study was a prospective, single-arm feasibility study. Participants were patients who met&#xD;
      the entry criteria and were referred to the Meuhedet health service Physical Therapy&#xD;
      outpatient clinic, Jerusalem, from September 2019 to February 2020. The sample size was based&#xD;
      on previous recommendations for pilot and feasibility studies (Julious 2005; Billingham,&#xD;
      Whitehead, and Julious 2013). Inclusion criteria were: AT that was clinically determined by&#xD;
      an orthopedic surgeon (E.S) according to nontraumatic pain and tenderness at the Achilles&#xD;
      tendon and report of decreased activity levels secondary to Achilles pain; a history of&#xD;
      running for at least one session a week in the past three months; age &gt; 18 and &lt; 70.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria were having other lower extremity injuries; prior treatment with eccentric&#xD;
      exercise or currently receiving Physical Therapy for AT; received a steroid injection into&#xD;
      the tendon in the three months prior, or underwent Achilles tendon surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants received a total of nine treatment sessions, twice a week for a total of five&#xD;
      weeks. Each treatment consisted of backward walking / running over an 8ยบ negatively inclined&#xD;
      treadmill. (Landice L7 Rehabilitation treadmill, New Jersey, USA) with a warmup and a&#xD;
      cooldown on a stationary bike. A detailed description of the protocol is presented in Table&#xD;
      1. As backward locomotion on a treadmill was novel for all participants they were advised to&#xD;
      hold the treadmill handles during the adjustment period (treatment sessions 1-3).&#xD;
      Participants were also instructed to refrain from specific sports which involve continuous&#xD;
      jumping and forward running throughout the intervention period. Patients were informed that&#xD;
      if they do not feel comfortable with the training protocol, they could terminate their&#xD;
      participation at any point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments took place at baseline, pretreatment four, pretreatment six, and at a separate&#xD;
      meeting after treatment nine&#xD;
