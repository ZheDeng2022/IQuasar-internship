  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to refine and pilot test a mobile health (mHealth), video-based&#xD;
      family management program for parents of preterm infants hospitalized in the Neonatal&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (NICU). By moving beyond the basic infant care tasks taught by parenting&#xD;
      programs and instead comprehensively training parents to use evidence-based family management&#xD;
      skills, we hypothesize that our intervention, called PREEMIE PROGRESS, will better equip&#xD;
      parents to meet the chronic, complex healthcare needs of their preterm infant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increasing numbers of very preterm infants are surviving and have chronic, complex healthcare&#xD;
      needs due to prematurity. These infants experience increased healthcare utilization, long&#xD;
      durations of stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), and are at high risk of&#xD;
      developing prematurity-related complications. As a result, their care is complex, and&#xD;
      families need structured training to effectively understand, monitor, and manage their&#xD;
      infant's care. PREEMIE PROGRESS is an innovative, video-based intervention that applies&#xD;
      evidence-based family management theories to better equip parents to meet the chronic,&#xD;
      complex healthcare needs of their preterm infant. This research aims to 1) refine a novel&#xD;
      family management program, called PREEMIE PROGRESS, through iterative usability and&#xD;
      acceptability testing and 2) test feasibility and acceptability of the refined intervention&#xD;
      and study procedures in a pilot randomized controlled trial. This project will use&#xD;
      implementation science tools and approaches to refine the intervention and study procedures&#xD;
      to ensure that PREEMIE PROGRESS addresses key program elements that will be important for&#xD;
      future adoption and implementation in NICU settings. We anticipate that the intervention will&#xD;
      decrease parent anxiety and depression, increase infant weight gain and receipt of mother's&#xD;
      milk, and reduce neonatal healthcare utilization. The long-term goal of this project is to&#xD;
      develop, test, and translate into NICU practice an efficacious family management intervention&#xD;
      for parents of preterm infants. Dr. Weber will significantly advance nursing science through&#xD;
      this project by obtaining preliminary feasibility and acceptability data for a scalable and&#xD;
      sustainable intervention to facilitate family management and improve parent-infant health&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
