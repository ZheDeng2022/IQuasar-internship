      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a live, oral, combined Shigella-ETEC&#xD;
      vaccine candidate, known as strain CVD 1208S-122, is safe and immunogenic. This will be a&#xD;
      phase 1, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-escalating, single-center study, involving&#xD;
      three vaccine dosage escalation cohorts (10^8, 10^9, and 10^10 cfu vaccine organisms). Each&#xD;
      of the three dose-escalation cohorts will consist of 8 study participants who will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to receive either vaccine (n=6) or placebo (n=2), as a single, oral dose.&#xD;
      An independent Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review the available safety data for&#xD;
      Cohorts 1 - 3 through 7 days post-vaccination before proceeding to the enrollment of the next&#xD;
      cohort. The fourth cohort will be an adaptive design cohort consisting of 30 study&#xD;
      participants to be randomly allocated to receive either two doses of vaccine (n=12), one dose&#xD;
      of vaccine (n=12), or two doses of placebo (n=6), with the dosage selection based on the&#xD;
      highest well-tolerated dose in the dose-escalation cohorts (1 - 3), as determined by the SMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of the dose-escalation cohorts (1 - 3) will receive the oral dose of blinded study&#xD;
      product while in the inpatient setting. During the following subsequent 96 hours (4 days),&#xD;
      participants will remain on the inpatient research isolation ward to be closely monitored,&#xD;
      and each stool will be collected by study staff. The evaluation and monitoring of&#xD;
      participants enrolled in the fourth cohort will be conducted entirely in the outpatient&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
