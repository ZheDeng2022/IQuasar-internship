    <textblock>
      This study aims to use the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to build and optimize a&#xD;
      multi-component intervention that improves diet quality. The investigators will evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of evidence-based public health interventions on consumers' diet quality via a&#xD;
      web-based grocery store &quot;NUSMart&quot; and then identify a multi-component intervention that&#xD;
      includes only those interventions meaningfully affecting diet quality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The important role that diet plays in health and disease is well established. Excessive&#xD;
      intake of energy, saturated fat and sodium increase the risk of heart disease, diabetes and&#xD;
      certain cancers. As a result, interventions aimed at encouraging healthier food consumption&#xD;
      have been pursued by many countries. These can be broadly grouped into the following&#xD;
      categories: price manipulations, food labeling, and behavioral nudges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No study has previously assessed the potentially interactive effects of a multi-component&#xD;
      intervention that incorporates the strongest features of each intervention component while&#xD;
      discarding those that do not meaningfully contribute to healthier consumption. That is the&#xD;
      goal of this effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this end, the investigators chose a full-factorial design because this experimental design&#xD;
      allows us to estimate not only the independent (main) effects of the interventions but also&#xD;
      their interaction effects. The full-factorial design includes all possible combinations of&#xD;
      the interventions' status. Because the investigators have four interventions, each of which&#xD;
      has two levels (intervention On or Off), there are 16 (i.e. 2^4) experimental conditions/arms&#xD;
      in total. The four interventions for this study are outlined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Explicit Tax: To impose an explicit tax on food and beverage items that are eligible for&#xD;
      red stop-sign (explained in b.) as less healthy foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foods and Beverages: The investigators will impose a 20% tax on sales price of the food&#xD;
      items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food Labels (with the summary of healthiness of shopping baskets &amp; targets): To provide&#xD;
           the green circle 'healthy choice' food label to items with Nutri-Score &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, the&#xD;
           amber circle 'in between healthy and unhealthy choice' food label to items with&#xD;
           Nutri-Score &quot;C&quot;, and the red stop-sign 'Unhealthy choice' food label to items with&#xD;
           Nutri-Score &quot;D&quot; and &quot;E&quot;. In the presence of food labels, before shopping, subjects will&#xD;
           watch a video briefly explaining the food labels on the store and be provided a live&#xD;
           visual indicator of the healthiness of shoppers' current basket (called &quot;My Cart&#xD;
           Summary&quot;) with the recommended healthy baskets goals (i.e., Green logo products ≥ 60%&#xD;
           and Red logo products ≤ 15% of the weighted number of servings of products.). My Cart&#xD;
           Summary will be displayed as a pie chart with the proportion of servings in their&#xD;
           current shopping baskets, according to the three food labels. This way, as shoppers add&#xD;
           to their basket while browsing the store, they will have visual feedback on how their&#xD;
           latest addition contributes to their total basket healthiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ordering: To order food items by Nutri-Score such that healthier items are shown upfront&#xD;
           on NUSMart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Within Group Substitution: At the checkout, to provide consumers with an opportunity to&#xD;
           replace their original items with an item chosen from two or four recommended&#xD;
           substitutes that are healthier within their corresponding food categories based on the&#xD;
           similarities of price, ingredients, flavor, and other characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of the 16 arms and instructed to perform a&#xD;
      one-time hypothetical grocery shopping on NUSMart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect participants' demographic and health characteristics as well&#xD;
      as hunger at the time of the survey and their self-control in the baseline survey. The&#xD;
      collected data will be used to precisely estimate the causal effect of the interventions and&#xD;
      address their underlying mechanism to change consumers' food choices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypotheses about the effects of the interventions on diet quality, measured by the&#xD;
      weighted average Nutri-Score (primary) of finalized shopping baskets, are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. There will be significant and positive main effects of each of the interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be significant and positive interaction effects on diet quality of: Explicit&#xD;
           tax &amp; food labels, Food labels &amp; ordering.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also run models both with and without including covariates that include demographic&#xD;
      variables (e.g., age, minority status, income, BMI, sex, and household size) and measurements&#xD;
      of self-control, hunger, and health-status. To test the moderating effects of hunger,&#xD;
      self-control, health-status, and education level, we will include interaction terms between&#xD;
      the intervention arms and these variables.&#xD;
