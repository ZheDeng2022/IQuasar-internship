      - The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of White Portland cement and MTA in&#xD;
      primary anterior teeth pulpotomy and follow up after 3 , 6 , 12 months ( Clinically and&#xD;
      Radiographically) : Group A ( Control group ) : primary anterior teeth pulpotomized by White&#xD;
      MTA . Group B : primary anterior teeth pulpotomized by White Portland Cement .&#xD;
&#xD;
      - The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of White Portland cement and MTA in&#xD;
      pulpotomy primary canines for serial extraction and extract them after 3 months for&#xD;
      Histopathlogic study : Group A ( Control group ) : primary canines pulpotomized by White MTA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Endodontic therapy for primary teeth faces several difficulties including morphology of&#xD;
           root canals , physiological root absorption and failure to find ideal root-filling paste&#xD;
           absorbs the same degree of root absorption .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulpotomy therapy is considered easy , fast and does not include the length of canal or&#xD;
           periapical region .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The split mouth design will be adopted for the treated samples .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical success criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Absence of spontaneous or stimulant pain&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Absence gingival redness , swelling or fistula&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Physiological tooth mobility and absence sensitivity to percussion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographically success criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Absence periapical translucence&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Absence external or internal abnormal absorption&#xD;
