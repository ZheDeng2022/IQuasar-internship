      The purpose of the present research protocol is to investigate and identify translocator&#xD;
      protein 18kDa, MRI DTI, and EEG/ERPs, markers of Chronic Systemic Symptoms (CSS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 2016, there were an estimated 15.5 million cancer survivors in the US, with a forecasted&#xD;
      20.3 million by 2026. Three percent of those survivors were treated for Head and neck cancers&#xD;
      (HNC). This number is expected to rise due to increased long-term survival in patients with&#xD;
      HPV associated oropharyngeal cancer. Increasing survivorship has generated a surge of&#xD;
      interest in late effects of HNC therapy. Studies to date have largely focused on chronic&#xD;
      effects stemming from local tissue damage. Recent data suggests that late systemic effects&#xD;
      may be equally problematic. Chronic systemic symptoms (CSS) persist far longer than&#xD;
      previously considered and are the source of significant function loss and detriment to&#xD;
      quality of life. CSS include fatigue, neurocognitive dysfunction, centralized pain, mood&#xD;
      disorders, sleep disturbances, and hypothalamic dysfunction manifested as thermal discomfort&#xD;
      or hyperhidrosis. Systemic symptoms occur in clusters resulting in a heightened clinical&#xD;
      impact. As with other critical illnesses, the trajectory of recovery from the systemic&#xD;
      symptoms from cancer treatment is varied. Some patients will recover to baseline quickly post&#xD;
      treatment while others display CSS that persist or worsen over time resulting in functional&#xD;
      deficits, frailty, and an early aging phenotype which may impact survival. Survivors&#xD;
      exhibiting a &quot;slow burn&quot; trajectory as manifested by persistent systemic symptom burden and&#xD;
      worsening function over time, require extensive on-going long-term management. These patients&#xD;
      often fail to return to work or previously held family roles. CSS may therefore be associated&#xD;
      with greater economic cost than the initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work that spans a wide array of inflammatory disease processes (such as fibromyalgia, chronic&#xD;
      fatigue syndrome, irritable bowel, etc.) demonstrate the presence of somatic, affective, and&#xD;
      cognitive symptoms. Neuroinflammation is hypothesized to be the underlying cause of these&#xD;
      symptoms and their manifestations. More specifically, peripheral injury/trauma/cancer release&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators that activate glial components of peripheral and central cellular&#xD;
      circuitry causing inflammation of the CNS. However, the concept that CSS is underlined by&#xD;
      neuroinflammation is largely theoretical from disparate and indirect evidence. A gap in the&#xD;
      evidence base suggests direct investigation of neuroinflammation in CSS patients in capturing&#xD;
      a mechanistic marker is urgently needed in order to (1) present CSS as a diagnostic entity,&#xD;
      (2) fully understand its neurobiological mechanism, and (3) test/develop appropriate&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
