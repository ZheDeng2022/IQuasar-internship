  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to analyse the potential benefits of ingesting a commercially&#xD;
      available pre-workout multi-ingredient supplement providing ~90 Kcal. for 25g of powder:&#xD;
      carbohydrates -isomaltulose, fructose, maltodextrin- 15 g, essential amino-acids&#xD;
      -Beta-alanine -L-arginine AKG, L-Leucine, Taurine, L-citrulline- 6.8 g, Creatine monohydrate:&#xD;
      2g, Guarana Extract: 800mg, total caffeine: 160mg, and Magnesium: 112.5mg) vs Placebo CHO&#xD;
      intake on body composition, physical performance, Happiness Score (specially designed by our&#xD;
      sponsor company, including different self-reported and validated tests on their short form)&#xD;
      and every workout: Self-perceived energy feeling and adherence to the intervention.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The methodology will follow a Home-based, online, double-blinded, randomised, long-term&#xD;
      design. The participants recruited will be active, middle-aged and older healthy adults. The&#xD;
      supplement intake will be a Pre-workout supplement intake or a placebo intake. The exercise&#xD;
      training will be a Progressive Resistance Training, with sessions of ~1 hour (3 times/week).&#xD;
      The intervention will last for a minimum of one year and the possibility to prolong it to&#xD;
      another one (two years of intervention) if the adherence to the treatment was higher to the&#xD;
      75% of the participants (of, at least, 85% of the training sessions and supplementation&#xD;
      intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes that will be assessed are: Body composition (fat mass and fat-free mass),&#xD;
      physical performance (short test designed by Go Fit Lab: single-leg standing balance,&#xD;
      upper-body strength - maximum number of push-ups repetitions in 15 seconds -, lower-body&#xD;
      mechanical power - vertical jump -, agility/velocity - 30 seconds of static running at&#xD;
      maximum velocity -, recovery assessment - 60 seconds monitoring of heart rate after the&#xD;
      previous test -), Happiness Score (designed by Go Fit, including different self-reported&#xD;
      validated tests, such as: Par-Q+, ACSM Cardiovascular Risk Factors Questionnaire, SF-12 for&#xD;
      quality of life and self-perceived health status, PSS-4 Stress and mental health, Pittsburgh&#xD;
      Sleeping Quality test, PREDIMED test: adherence to Mediterranean diet eating patterns, and&#xD;
      the IPAQ short form), and for every workout: Self-perceived energy feeling (Questionnaire:&#xD;
      Energy Level, Fatigue, Alertness and Focus for the Task), Rate of Perceived Exertion (OMNI&#xD;
      RES Scale and Borg Scale) and adherence to regular physical exercise practise, healthy&#xD;
      nutritional patterns, and supplement intake.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Every participant will be randomized to any of the groups. The principal investigator will be blinded for the supplement and allocation of the participants until the end of the analysis of the results after the intervention. Therefore, an external and third researcher will send the supplements to every participant and will keep the record of the randomised allocation of each of them until the end of the analysis of the last outcomes assessments collection.</masking_description>
