  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the onset of the sixth decade in life, degenerative processes affect the neuromuscular&#xD;
      system in terms of losses in muscle strength (dynapenia) and muscle mass (sarcopenia). Neural&#xD;
      (e.g., numerical loss of alpha motoneurons) and morphological factors. Borde et al. 123&#xD;
      number and size of particularly type-II muscle fibers), as well as their interaction, are&#xD;
      responsible for age-related declines in muscle strength and mass. There is evidence that&#xD;
      muscular weakness is highly associated with impaired mobility and an increased risk for&#xD;
      falls. Moreover, lower extremity muscle weakness was identified as the dominant intrinsic&#xD;
      fall-risk factor with a five-fold increase in the risk of falling. An anti-gravity treadmill&#xD;
      allows users to walk or run in a reduced body weight environment. The user walks or runs on a&#xD;
      treadmill belt surrounded by an enclosed, air-filled chamber. When air pressure increases, an&#xD;
      upward force offloads the weight of the runner and decreases the percentage of body weight&#xD;
      (BW%) experienced upon foot impact. So, a research question was developed in our mind after&#xD;
      the literature review. Is there any effect of AGT training on fall risk of older adults?&#xD;

    <measure>Timed up and go test (TUG)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Test is also commonly used to evaluate fall risk.A faster time for completion of required task indicates a better ability to perform functional activities. The person sits up from the chair after instruction and walks at his normal pace for 3 meters, takes a turn and sits down after walking back towards the chair. The total duration required for this activity is measured using a stop watch.</description>

    <measure>Berg balance scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of functional balance was done using BBS which is valid and reliable tool for dynamic and static balance assessment. It consists of 14 Items and balance is assessed using an ordinal scale comprising 5 points that ranges from 0 to 4. High scores are indicative of superior balance where as low scores are suggestive of increased fall risk and poor balance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional reach test</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>This test is used to assess stability level of patient. The assessment is carried out by calculating the maximum distance a person is able to reach forward in a fixed standing position. The assessment is carried out by calculating the maximum distance a person is able to reach forward in a fixed standing position. Lower distance of functional reach test indicated higher risk of fall and deteriorated balance and vice versa.</description>

    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>FRS provide an objective assessment of static and dynamic balance and was assessed using dynamic posturo graphy system. High scores of FRS indicated higher risk of fall and deteriorated balance and vice versa.</description>

    <measure>Balance App</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>There are six different tasks that subject have perform with system, like, normal walking up to 6 meters, walking with head movement, standing with eyes open and close and standing on a compromised surface with eyes open and close. High scores indicated higher risk of fall and deteriorated balance and vice versa.</description>

    <measure>Force Plate</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week.</time_frame>
    <description>Force plates is portable, non-invasive and quantitative instrument used to measure the ground reaction forces, variation in center of gravity and forces impact on foot. Postural sways will be calculated from force plate data. Randomness in data show increase risk of fall and poor balance.</description>
