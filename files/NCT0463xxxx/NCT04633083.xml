  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Limited range-of-motion (ROM) is a common problem after reverse shoulder arthroplasty (RSA).&#xD;
      The occurrence and magnitude depend on both surgical and patient-related factors. The most&#xD;
      important surgical factor is the occurrence of impingement, which implicates collision&#xD;
      between the humeral implant or bone and the scapula, limiting further motion. Patient-related&#xD;
      factors such as scapula geometry and muscle function and activation also play an important&#xD;
      role. Surgeons have to account for these factors when planning and implanting a RSA. Software&#xD;
      models can support the surgeon during preoperative planning by using imaging data to simulate&#xD;
      the ROM of a patient's shoulder after RSA. These software models allow for adaptation of the&#xD;
      implant position during preoperative planning and, by this optimize the postoperative ROM.&#xD;
      However, the models currently developed are limited in terms of ROM simulation and the&#xD;
      factors the models take into account.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The impingement-free ROM in a RSA patient is defined as the rotational area the humeral liner&#xD;
      can move through without colliding against the scapula or dislocating the joint. In a&#xD;
      previous study, a new software model was developed that uses imaging data to compute and&#xD;
      quantify the impingement-free ROM of a patient according to clinically relevant motions.&#xD;
      Before this model can be used in clinical practice, a validation of the model's accuracy in&#xD;
      predicting real RSA patient outcomes is required. Therefore, the first objective is to verify&#xD;
      the model's ability to predict the ROM of the glenohumeral joint in real RSA patients. The&#xD;
      investigators will investigate and quantify the ROM and joint angles of RSA patients with and&#xD;
      without impingement with the help of EOS imaging and video motion analysis. The investigators&#xD;
      can then compare model outputs with measured patient outcomes. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators will investigate how well our software model can predict impingement in&#xD;
      patients with known postoperative impingement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the software model uses a database of healthy shoulder kinematic motions to&#xD;
      produce an objective ROM score for a RSA. However, it is not known if healthy shoulder&#xD;
      kinematics are a suitable reference for quantifying and interpreting RSA kinematics.&#xD;
      Glenohumeral motions of healthy subjects are already extensively described by Ludewig et al.&#xD;
      Glenohumeral motions of RSA patients are not yet reported. Also, little is known about muscle&#xD;
      activation patterns in RSA patients. The second objective is to describe muscle activation&#xD;
      patterns and shoulder kinematics of RSA patients and compare our measured RSA kinematic&#xD;
      motions to the healthy kinematic motion data currently used in the software model. Therefore,&#xD;
      the investigators will perform instrumented 3D motion analysis in conjunction with&#xD;
      electromyography measurements to incorporate muscle activation patterns into our RSA&#xD;
      glenohumeral motion analysis. Our additional sub-objective is to compare muscle activation&#xD;
      patterns between patients with and without limited ROM, with the goal of identifying&#xD;
      differences between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third objective is to identify patient-related and implant related factors that influence&#xD;
      the ROM after a reversed shoulder arthroplasty. Therefore, the investigators will investigate&#xD;
      clinical factors that could have effect on the ROM after RSA. The different factors (sex,&#xD;
      birth year, Body Mass Index, generic score EQ-5D-3L, Tampa Schaal voor kinesofobia) will be&#xD;
      analyzed both across and within patients with and without limited ROM with the goal of&#xD;
      identifying their relation to ROM. The most important implanted related factor will also be&#xD;
      investigated and analyzed both across and within groups: implant position in terms of glenoid&#xD;
      component version, inclination and location of center of rotation.&#xD;
