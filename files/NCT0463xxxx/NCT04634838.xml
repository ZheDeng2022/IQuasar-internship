  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thirty patients of 18-85 years of age, with 2-30 cm2 pressure ulcers or post-op wounds, will&#xD;
      be recruited and treated with either wound dressing containing silver or wound dressings&#xD;
      containing copper oxide microparticles. The efficacy of the two types of dressings in&#xD;
      reducing the size and improving the condition of the wounds will be compared.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be divided into 3 periods. Patients with pressure ulcers or post-operation&#xD;
      wounds with wound areas of 2-30 cm2, who will accept participating in the study, pass all the&#xD;
      accepted inclusion criteria, and sign the informed consent form, will be recruited. Then they&#xD;
      will be treated with silver dressings for up to three weeks (first period). In case that the&#xD;
      wounds will not show a reduction of at least 50% of the wound area during the first period,&#xD;
      then the wounds will be treated with the copper oxide dressings for at least 3 weeks (second&#xD;
      period). In case that there will be a clear improvement during the second period, the wounds&#xD;
      may continue to be treated with the copper oxide dressings or with any other wound dressings&#xD;
      according to the treating physician judgement and decision for an additional 3 weeks (third&#xD;
      period) or earlier if the wound will be closed.&#xD;
