      Multicenter post-approval observational retrospective cohort study in routine clinical&#xD;
      practice (Real World Evidence Study) to assess the 1-year safety profile associated with&#xD;
      ticagrelor and clopidogrel therapy in a contemporary reprospective cohort of patients who&#xD;
      survived the initial 30-day period after the index hospitalization for acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome (ACS).&#xD;

      To date, there are still a paucity of data on the medium- and long-term safety and efficacy&#xD;
      outcomes of new antiplatelet agents, namely Ticagrelor and Prasugrel, compared to Clopidogrel&#xD;
      in a real-world ACS setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ARIAM-Andalusia multicentre Registry, and the CREA-ARIAM multicentre Registry&#xD;
      (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02500290; Fundación Pública Andaluza Progreso y&#xD;
      SaludIdentifier: FPS-AAS-2014-01), are two Real World Evidence (RWE) studies aimed to&#xD;
      investigate real-world practice on antiplatelet treatment in patients with ACS in Andalusia&#xD;
      (Western Spain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group are interested in performing a retrospective observational pilot analysis using&#xD;
      data from patients with ACS admitted to cardiovascular intensive care units in Andalusia&#xD;
      (Spain), who were prospectively included in the ARIAM-Andalusia multicentre Registry, and the&#xD;
      CREA-ARIAM multicentre Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02500290; Fundación&#xD;
      Pública Andaluza Progreso y Salud-Identifier: FPS-AAS-2014-01) between 2014 and March 2019.&#xD;
      The main findings from the RWE study revealed a consistent net clinical benefit of Ticagrelor&#xD;
      vs Clopidogrel resulted in a significant reduction of short-term all-cause mortality favored&#xD;
      Ticagrelor. In this scenario, after baseline imbalance adjustment using propensity score&#xD;
      matching (PSM) and IPTW (inverse probability of treatment weight) methods, the net clinical&#xD;
      benefit with Ticagrelor persisted. Preliminary results of the above mentioned study have been&#xD;
      presented as an oral communication at the Annual Scientific Meeting of the Spanish Society of&#xD;
      Cardiology (Madrid, October 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this new pilot study suggested is to describe the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      Ticagrelor vs Clopidogrel after the first 30 days from hospital discharge and up to 1 year&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Clopidogrel</arm_group_label>
    <description>Clopidogrel is a prodrug that requires metabolic activation in two stepsby hepatic CYP450 enzymes to produce the active metabolite that inhibits platelet aggregation. The active metabolite of clopidogrel selectively inhibits the binding of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) to its platelet P2Y12 receptor and the subsequent ADP-mediated activation of the glycoprotein GPIIb/IIIa complex, thereby inhibiting platelet aggregation. Consequently, due to the irreversible binding to the P2Y12 receptor,platelets exposed to clopidogrel's active metabolite are affected for the remainder of their lifespan (about 7 to 10 days) and recovery of normal platelet function occurs at a rate consistent with the normal platelet turnover. Clopidogrel was approved by the European Commission on 15 July 1998 for the secondary prevention of atherothrombotic events in adult patients with ACS.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Ticagrelor</arm_group_label>
    <description>Ticagrelor is a nucleoside analogue member of the chemical class cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidines (CPTP), which is a selective and reversible ADP- receptor antagonist acting on the platelet P2Y12 receptor. This prevents the binding of ADP to the receptor which attenuates plateletactivation and aggregation.The drug was approved by the European Commission on December 3, 2010, for the prevention of thrombotic events (cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction and stroke) in patients with ACS (unstable angina, non ST elevation Myocardial Infarction [NSTEMI] or ST elevation Myocardial Infarction [STEMI]) including patients managed medically, and those who are managed with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) or coronary artery by-pass grafting (CABG).</description>
