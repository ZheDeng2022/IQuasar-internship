  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain causes many physiological and psychological changes in the body, increases the level of&#xD;
      anxiety in children and causes prolongation of examination and other procedures. The pain&#xD;
      should be evaluated separately for each child, taking into account the level of pain and the&#xD;
      individual differences in the response to pain. Mankind has been exposed to many invasive&#xD;
      interventions throughout his life from birth and experiences pain and anxiety in relation to&#xD;
      this. Experiences with childhood pain shape the future pain responses of children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, which was planned to stimulate the touch receptors of two different balls used&#xD;
      during venous blood collection, to determine the effect of children between the ages of 6-12&#xD;
      on pain and fear levels, is a randomized controlled study. A total of 200 children will be&#xD;
      included in the research. The experimental groups to be included in the research will be&#xD;
      asked to grasp the balls with their hands in accordance with their groups, and no attempt&#xD;
      will be made to the control group. The research data will be obtained with the Wong-Baker&#xD;
      Faces Pain Rating Scale and Child Fear Scale, which will be used to evaluate before and after&#xD;
      the procedure. In addition, oxygen saturation and heart rate will be evaluated immediately&#xD;
      before and after removal of the tourniquet.&#xD;

    <measure>Pain level as assessed with Wong-Baker Faces Pain Rating Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>This scale to be used to assess pain in our study was developed by Donna Wong and Connie Morain Baker in 1981 and revised in 1983. The scale is widely used to measure pain intensity in children over the age of three. Pain is scored according to numerical values assigned to faces that show an expression spectrum; smiling face represents no pain (0 points), crying face represents severe pain (10 points). The scale is a valid and reliable tool for measuring procedural pain severity. Permission for the scale was obtained from the official website of the Wong-Baker Faces Foundation. The Turkish translation of the scale was sent by Nick Baker, official site official of the Wong-Baker Faces Foundation.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Fear as assessed using the Child Fear Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>during the procedure</time_frame>
    <description>It is used to determine the child's fear and anxiety level. Fear and anxiety are assessed on a five-point scale. The single-item scale consists of five facial expressions regardless of gender. The first facial expression of the scale is neutral and has a value of zero. The last facial expression is worth four points expressing extreme fear. In this study, Child Fear Scale will be used to evaluate the fear levels of children in the experimental and control groups before and after the bloodletting procedure. The scale was introduced into the Turkish language by Gerçeker et al. (2018). Test-retest reliability of the Child Fear Scale was found to be quite high, and its content validity index was determined as 0.89. Since the scale is in the form of scoring, item-total correlation and Cronbach alpha coefficient could not be calculated.</description>
