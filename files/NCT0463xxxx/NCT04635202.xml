  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The growing prevalence of metabolic syndrome (MetS) in the worldwide is becoming a serious&#xD;
      health problem and economic burden. MetS has become a crucial risk factor for the development&#xD;
      of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and cardiovascular diseases (CVD). The rising rates of CVD&#xD;
      and diabetes, which are the two leading causes of death. To prevent the progression of MetS&#xD;
      to diabetes and CVD, regular physical activity is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elliptical trainer device is a relatively new modality of exercise and is advertised to be&#xD;
      superior to a treadmill because of the low joint impact and the more reasonable costs of an&#xD;
      elliptical trainer compared to a treadmill. Additional quantitative research is needed to&#xD;
      further evaluate the effectiveness of elliptical trainers and the physiological and&#xD;
      perceptual responses to the machine.&#xD;

      Forty sedentary MeTS patients (from both sexes) will be randomly divided to group A and group&#xD;
      B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Group A (Elliptical training group): This group (n=20) will receive aerobic training on an&#xD;
      elliptical trainer for 16 weeks (3 sessions per week). The session will start with 5 minutes&#xD;
      warming up at 50 % of maximal heart rate (MHR), 20-minute continuous ET at 70% of MHR, 12&#xD;
      minutes (4×3) intervals at 90% of MHR with a 3-minute active recovery at 70% of MHR between&#xD;
      intervals, and finally 5-minute cool-down period at 50% of MHR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: this group will continue their normal daily physical activities without any&#xD;
      additional training&#xD;
