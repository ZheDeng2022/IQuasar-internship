  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder surgery has evolved over the past decade with many procedures now done on an&#xD;
      outpatient basis. Multimodal pain management strategies and regional anesthesia have greatly&#xD;
      contributed to this transition and newer strategies continue to evolve. Uncontrolled pain can&#xD;
      often lead to readmissions, prolonged hospital or ambulatory stays and an overall negative&#xD;
      patient experience. Despite improvements in regional anesthetic technique and newer longer&#xD;
      acting medicines such as liposomal bupivacaine, the duration of pain relief is often only&#xD;
      over the course of 72 hours postoperatively. Post-operative pain beyond 72 hours is largely&#xD;
      inflammatory in nature. As such, biologic approaches to reduce surgical tissue damage-induced&#xD;
      inflammation is an attractive therapeutic addition to surgical procedures. These approaches&#xD;
      are especially relevant in light of the current opioid epidemic plaguing the United States.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Flowable, placental-derived connective tissue matrix (pECM) is a potential option to&#xD;
      supplement damaged tissue prone to inflammation as it introduces nascent, hydrated components&#xD;
      of the inflammatory phase, including structural proteins and growth factors, which allow for&#xD;
      efficient repair. Derived from relatively immune-privileged tissue, placental-derived pECM&#xD;
      elicits little or no immune response in recipients. They have been shown to greatly reduce&#xD;
      inflammatory cell influx and inflammatory cytokines present in dermal and mucosal surgical&#xD;
      sites post-operatively. Moreover, placental-derived pECM reduces expression of prostaglandin&#xD;
      E2, a potent pain mediator, in vitro. In the orthopedic space, ECM has been used effectively&#xD;
      to reduce pain following spinal fusion and for treatment of knee arthritis. Taken together,&#xD;
      biologic therapies directed at modulating inflammation and associated pain is an increasing&#xD;
      area of interest with far reaching implications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to prospectively analyze two groups of patients treated&#xD;
      for arthroscopic shoulder surgery with and without a flowable pECM to determine if a&#xD;
      significant reduction in pain and opioid consumption as measured in morphine equivalent units&#xD;
      is demonstrated within the first 6 weeks of surgery. Furthermore, patients will be compared&#xD;
      in regard to early range of motion and patient reported outcomes to determine if a difference&#xD;
      is present when the ECM is utilized within the first 6 months of surgery. This is the first&#xD;
      double blinded prospective series in the shoulder literature to date looking at a pECM graft&#xD;
      for pain reduction and improved range of motion perioperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Utilizing a prospective randomized controlled trial, the aim of this study is to assess&#xD;
      modulation of post-operative pain and narcotic use when a placental-derived extracellular&#xD;
      matrix is injected into the bed of the repair following outpatient arthroscopic shoulder&#xD;
      surgery. Furthermore, this study aims to determine if the addition of pECM influences patient&#xD;
      reported outcomes and influences early postoperative range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aims &amp; Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a: To assess post-operative narcotic consumption (measured in morphine equivalent units)&#xD;
      between patients treated with flowable placental-derived pECM compared to those patients&#xD;
      undergoing arthroscopic shoulder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Narcotic consumption (measured in morphine equivalent units) will be reduced in&#xD;
      patients treated with an extracullar matrix graft as compared to those patients undergoing&#xD;
      rotator cuff surgery without.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Utilizing a prospective randomized controlled trial, narcotic use will be measured&#xD;
      for 24-hour increments for a total of 7 post-operative days (PODs) then once on POD 14, 21,&#xD;
      28, and 42. . Consumption will be measured by the number of tablets ingested and converted to&#xD;
      morphine equivalent units and compared between the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b: To determine if flowable placental-derived pECM decreases patient-reported&#xD;
      post-operative VAS pain in patients undergoing outpatient rotator cuff surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be a decrease in VAS pain for up to 6 weeks post-operatively among&#xD;
      participants who receive pECM, as compared to the control group (no pECM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Utilizing a prospective randomized controlled trial, post-operative&#xD;
      patient-reported VAS pain (on a scale of 0-10) will be collected 1 times per day (every 24&#xD;
      hours) for 7 post-operative days (PODs); then an average score collected on POD 14, POD 21,&#xD;
      POD 28, and POD 42. Scores will be averaged and compared between the two treatment groups for&#xD;
      the first 7 days, 2 week, 3rd week, 4th week and 6th week postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aims &amp; Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2a: To assess patient-reported outcomes and early range of motion (measured in morphine&#xD;
      equivalents) in patients treated with flowable placental-derived pECM compared to patients&#xD;
      injected with saline control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: There will be improved patient reported outcomes and early range of motion&#xD;
      measured at 6 weeks and 3 months and 6 months postoperatively in patients receiving and&#xD;
      extracellular matrix injection following outpatient arthroscopic shoulder surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: Utilizing a prospective randomized controlled trial, patient reported outcomes as&#xD;
      measured by American Shoulder and Elbow Score, Simple Shoulder Test and SANE scores and range&#xD;
      of motion (External rotation, internal rotation and forward flexion) will be collected&#xD;
      preoperatively and at 2 weeks (external rotation), 6 weeks (all)) , 3 months (all) and 6&#xD;
      months (all) postoperatively. Scores and range of motion measurements will be averaged and&#xD;
      compared for differences between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a randomized double-blind randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups (see Intervention&#xD;
      Description). Patients will randomly select one of 70 sealed envelopes the day of surgery.&#xD;
      Patients will be blinded to the medication utilized as well as the treating surgeon (PI). A&#xD;
      consecutive series of patients will be enrolled to prevent selection bias. A single surgeon&#xD;
      will be performing all procedures to minimize variability. Upon completion of the surgery, a&#xD;
      spinal needle will be loaded into the substance of the rotator cuff tendon under direct&#xD;
      arthroscopic visualization. The surgeon will then leave the room and the envelope will be&#xD;
      opened by the circulating operating room nurse. If the patient is in the treatment group, 2cc&#xD;
      of an extracellular matrix graft be opened and then injected with a 22g spinal needle already&#xD;
      placed into the bed of the repair by the physician assistant. Those patients that are in the&#xD;
      control group will have the needle removed and no injection administered. The envelope will&#xD;
      be then sealed with the patient's name and treatment group to allow for data analysis upon&#xD;
      completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection will occur post-operatively for 6 months. Data will be collected at 13&#xD;
      timepoints, in total for pain and opioid consumption. For the first seven days, data will be&#xD;
      collected at 24-hour time intervals beginning the first morning after the surgery (POD1) at&#xD;
      8am then at 24-hour intervals for the next 7 days (POD7). Data will be collected using Oberd,&#xD;
      an application that uses text message or email to collect information. The morning after the&#xD;
      surgery (POD0) the first email will occur at 8am. Patients will then be notified by email&#xD;
      alert 1 times per day (8am) asking to rate their pain on a scale of 0-10 (VAS) beginning on&#xD;
      POD 1 thru POD 7. Patients will also respond to the number of pain pills taken in the slotted&#xD;
      time span. All patients will be prescribed the same narcotic regimen (oxycodone IR) barring&#xD;
      any allergies encountered. Patients who fail to respond to the email alert will be notified&#xD;
      by the data collection system and contacted via phone by study personnel. Patients lacking&#xD;
      smartphone technology will all be notified via telephone and also asked to keep a personal&#xD;
      log to capture the information needed.&#xD;
