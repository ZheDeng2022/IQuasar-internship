  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The progress of labour is traditionally determined by regular vaginal examinations (VEs) to&#xD;
      assess the cervix (neck of the womb) and the baby's head position. Such examinations can be&#xD;
      uncomfortable and risk causing infection to the baby or mother's womb. The findings are&#xD;
      subjective, can be unreliable and cannot be recorded for later review and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The novel, non-intrusive &quot;transperineal ultrasound&quot; technique has been developed utilising&#xD;
      existing scanning machines normally found on a delivery unit, with the ultrasound probe&#xD;
      placed outside the woman's vagina. This allows objective, recordable measurements creating&#xD;
      images that can be captured and stored electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective longitudinal observational cohort study in nulliparous term (37-42&#xD;
      weeks) labouring women. This study aims to improve the prediction of intrapartum Caesarean&#xD;
      Delivery (ICD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study contains ultrasound and clinical assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transabdominal Ultrasound to measure: Umbilical and Middle Cerebral Artery Doppler, fetal&#xD;
      head position and Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transperineal Ultrasound to assess: Head Perineum Distance (HPD), Caput Succedaneum and&#xD;
      moulding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital vaginal examination by a caregiver: to measure cervical dilatation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Mode of delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Time to delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neonatal outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Apgar score, cord pH level, gender, fetal birth weight, neonatal unit admission within 24&#xD;
      hours, neonatal morbidity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Intrapartum Caesarean Delivery (ICD) in advanced labour has a greater fetal and maternal&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality than an elective prelabour Caesarean delivery. The prediction of&#xD;
      delivery mode may reduce the likelihood of intrapartum Caesarean delivery. There is also a&#xD;
      parental desire to know the likelihood of vaginal delivery. Women admitted to delivery units&#xD;
      throughout the world undergo internal digital vaginal examination (DVE) when they are thought&#xD;
      to be in labour or where a diagnosis of labour needs to be discounted. DVE is an&#xD;
      uncomfortable experience, multiple examinations have been linked to ascending maternal and&#xD;
      fetal infection, and it is subjective method and not reliable technique to assess labour&#xD;
      progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has recently become possible to make assessments more objectively using ultrasound.&#xD;
      Ultrasound in labour (intrapartum ultrasound) has come to the forefront in the last decade&#xD;
      stemming from a persistent demand for a more reliable method of labour assessment coupled&#xD;
      with a wider availability of ultrasound on the delivery suite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesise in this study, that developing the previously derived proof of principle&#xD;
      labour prediction model for nulliparous women and using an additional data could improve the&#xD;
      prediction accuracy of intrapartum Caesarean delivery by developing a robust model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the additional data gathered in term nulliparous patients, will develop the model to&#xD;
      predict pregnancy outcomes. This may aid in delivery of care to pregnant women by providing a&#xD;
      real-time online calculation tool for the likelihood of Caesarean delivery and length of&#xD;
      labour based on repeat ultrasound measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be identified by the researcher and an emphasis will be placed on&#xD;
      recruiting patients antenatally as much as possible. All participating patients will be&#xD;
      consented prior to enrolment and will receive a full explanatory information leaflet. If&#xD;
      recruited antenatally, there is no time limit until the woman enters the delivery unit. If&#xD;
      recruited in labour, then 2 hours will be considered appropriate to make a decision on&#xD;
      whether they wish to take part and patient will only be approached when relatively pain-free&#xD;
      (in between contractions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The admission ultrasound scan will include if feasible fetal Doppler assessment of the&#xD;
      Umbilical Artery (Umb A) and Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA). Amniotic Fluid Index (AFI) will&#xD;
      also be measured. The fetal position will be assessed with a transabdominal scan and&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, Umb A and MCA Doppler in addition to the fetal position and AFI, will be assessed&#xD;
      with a transabdominal scan. After that, the transducer will be placed transperineally at the&#xD;
      level of the posterior fourchette in a transverse position to measure HPD while caput&#xD;
      succedaneum will be measured in a sagittal transperineal scan. The moulding will be assessed&#xD;
      as either present or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the ultrasound examination, women will be in the supine position with flexed hips and&#xD;
      knees and the bladder empty as previously described. Healthcare professionals will be blinded&#xD;
      to the ultrasound findings, and these findings will also not be disclosed to the parents.&#xD;
      Another doctor or midwife will perform all the ultrasound examinations. Subsequent scans will&#xD;
      be performed as required at the time of routine clinical examinations typically between 2-4&#xD;
      hours apart but it may be longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The healthcare professional will perform DVE for assessment of cervical dilatation in line&#xD;
      with the National Institute of Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) guidelines.&#xD;

        Recruitment will start upon approval of the study. The infrastructure, research fellow,&#xD;
        ultrasound machines, and the database are already in place, which ensure that the study can&#xD;
        start promptly upon approval, without affecting or compromising routine clinical service&#xD;
        provision. We aim to recruit minimum number according to the following calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        In the labour prediction model, there are approximately 12 variables with 10 patients&#xD;
        needed per variable and an approximate 25% Caesarean section rate (the primary outcome) in&#xD;
        the UK currently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Practical calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        12 x 10 x (100/25) = 480 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        For predictive modelling, 480 patients minimum are required (37- 42 weeks). We have&#xD;
        recruited 269 patients in the previous study, therefore, approximately 211 fully evaluable&#xD;
        patients will be needed. We intend to recruit 240 participants to allow approximately 10%&#xD;
        incomplete data/study withdrawals&#xD;
