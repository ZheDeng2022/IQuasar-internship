  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine what effects (good and bad) cabozantinib has in&#xD;
      treatment of patients with metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis for this trial is that cabozantinib has anti-tumor activity in a&#xD;
      molecularly-selected group of patients with CRPC.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm, open-label Phase II multi-institutional trial in 30 patients that have&#xD;
      been molecularly selected based on that their tumors possess alterations in molecular targets&#xD;
      of cabozantinib. Patients will be treated be continuously until they develop radiographic&#xD;
      progression or discontinue cabozantinib for toxicity. If 6 or more out of 12 subjects with&#xD;
      particular mutation or gene amplification show progression prior to 6 months, accrual for the&#xD;
      particular genomic alteration may close. In addition, a series of correlative studies will be&#xD;
      performed including tissue biopsies in order to further define the mechanisms of cabozantinib&#xD;
      anti-tumor action in prostate cancer and identify surrogate markers of response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is being done because additional effective treatments are needed for&#xD;
      prostate cancer that has spread and is growing despite hormone suppression. Prior studies&#xD;
      indicate that Cabozantinib may be effective in a subset of these participants, but that has&#xD;
      not yet been determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 subjects will take part in this study at 4 participating sites. We expect to enroll&#xD;
      approximately 20 participants at Weill Cornell Medicine and approximately 3-5 subjects per&#xD;
      participating site. All subjects participating in this study will be treated with&#xD;
      Cabozantinib. All subjects will continue to take LHRH analogue therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligible participants will be enrolled on the trial for approximately approximately 12&#xD;
      months. At that point, subjects will switch to long-term follow up for two years after&#xD;
      removal from the study or until death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study related procedures can be combined with routine Standard of Care (SOC) visits. These&#xD;
      will include obtaining medical history, vitals, routine blood collection, radiographic&#xD;
      imaging (CT, MRI and Bone scan), EKG and between 2 and 4 weeks after starting therapy, a&#xD;
      tumor biopsy is required. This will be done with a needle by local sedation by an&#xD;
      Interventional Radiologist.&#xD;
