      Study Description and Overview Thirty participants (males and females) ages 20 to 65&#xD;
      inclusive, who, at Screening, meet ICD-10 criteria for major depressive disorder (MDD), have&#xD;
      a current depressive episode of at least 30-day duration, have a Screening Montgomery-Asberg&#xD;
      Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score &gt;= 22 and meet all other inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be randomized with a 1-to-1 allocation under double-blind conditions to receive&#xD;
      a single 25 mg oral dose of psilocybin or a single 100 mg oral dose of niacin. Niacin will&#xD;
      serve as an active placebo control that provides an acute physiological response (flushing)&#xD;
      that is intended to aid in blinding of intervention allocation. All randomized participants&#xD;
      will be included in the Full Analysis Set (FAS) population used in analyzing primary and&#xD;
      secondary study endpoints. Only participants who meet depressive symptom severity criteria at&#xD;
      web screening (MADRS self-rating (MADRS-S) score &gt; =19) and who do not show an unacceptably&#xD;
      large degree of symptom improvement between the web screening and in-person screening&#xD;
      (indexed by change in MADRS-S (improvement) 30% (MADRS representing web screening will be&#xD;
      approximated to MADRS-S + 3) will be eligible for randomization. This is to minimize the risk&#xD;
      for spontaneous remission before dosing. Participants deemed eligible following successful&#xD;
      completion of all screening assessments including a structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) examination will be determined as eligible. Eligible participants at Baseline will&#xD;
      submit cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), submit blood samples, be examined with positron emission&#xD;
      tomography (PET) and the radioligand [11C]UCB-J and receive one preparation session (see&#xD;
      further below) to be eligible for randomization on Dosing (Day 0) to receive either&#xD;
      psilocybin or niacin active-placebo. They will complete follow-up visits, including outcome&#xD;
      measures assessments, on study Day 1, 8, 15, 42 and 365 (within corresponding visit windows).&#xD;
      At day 15 the sampling of CSF, blood and [11C]UCB-J PET will be repeated. PSIPET Protocol 5&#xD;
      200821 Page 15 After day 42, all participants will be given follow-up visits at Norra&#xD;
      Stockholms Psykiatri for up to one year after dosing, to study dedicated physicians or nurses&#xD;
      at a frequency determined by the health care professional. If needed to reach/stay in&#xD;
      remission, the participants will be provided antidepressant treatment in accordance with the&#xD;
      regional guidelines for antidepressant treatment&#xD;
      (https://psykiatristod.se/regionala-vardprogram/ depression). At least monthly the&#xD;
      participants will be asked to provide on-line symptom rating data (via 1177.se). At the&#xD;
      365-day visit, symptoms will be evaluated using MADRS, Clinical Global Impression Improvement&#xD;
      (CGI-I) and Severity (CGI-S) scales. After completing the study (one year or withdrawal),&#xD;
      participants will be subject to standard care, including referral in accordance with regional&#xD;
      guidelines. The study outcome measures will be used to assess depressive symptoms, clinical&#xD;
      global functioning, functional disability, anxiety symptoms and health-related quality of&#xD;
      life. Safety outcome measures will be collected at all assessment time points from the time&#xD;
      of consent through the end of study. To enhance participant safety, the current study&#xD;
      proposes to test psilocybin within a &quot;set and setting&quot; (SaS) protocol similar to the protocol&#xD;
      that has been used in all modern studies of psilocybin in both diseased and normal healthy&#xD;
      populations. The SaS protocol for this study includes: 1) a preparation with session&#xD;
      Facilitators (licensed psychologists) prior to dosing; 2) administration of study medications&#xD;
      in an aesthetically neutral room under the supervision of two Facilitators who are present&#xD;
      throughout the session (with the exception of short, temporary allowances for facilitator&#xD;
      breaks; e.g. bathroom breaks); and 3) three post-dose integration sessions during which&#xD;
      participants are encouraged to discuss their intervention experience with the Facilitators.&#xD;
      To evaluate the Facilitators' adherence to the study manual, and the role of Facilitators'&#xD;
      and participants' in-session behaviors for treatment outcome, all five sessions in the trial&#xD;
      with Facilitators present will be recorded. The SaS will be identical for those randomized to&#xD;
      psilocybin or niacin active placebo. Study Duration The planned maximum study duration for&#xD;
      each participant will be approximately one year, with variation primarily dependent on the&#xD;
      length of the screening period, the number of days between baseline and dosing, and the visit&#xD;
      windows provided for each post-dose assessment. For each participant, the study will be&#xD;
      divided into two phases: Phase A or treatment phase (day 0 to and including day 42), and&#xD;
      phase B or follow-up phase (day 43 -365). The primary objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy of a single 25 mg oral dose of psilocybin for major depressive disorder (MDD)&#xD;
      compared to an active placebo (niacin) in otherwise medically-healthy participants between&#xD;
      the ages of 20 and 65, assessed as the difference between groups in changes in depressive&#xD;
      symptoms. Primary Outcome Measure Change in blinded rater MADRS total score from Baseline to&#xD;
      Day 8.&#xD;
