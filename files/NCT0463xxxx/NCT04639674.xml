  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of cutaneous pruritus among hemodialysis patients is about 50% to 80%. There&#xD;
      is only a handful of studies on the itchy skin of hemodialysis patients and the findings are&#xD;
      to be validated. Effective drugs to treat cutaneous pruritus are not available yet. Hence,&#xD;
      the purpose of the study is to eliminate the uremic toxins from the intestinal tract using&#xD;
      AST-120 as a treatment measure to improve the symptom of the hemodialysis patients' cutaneous&#xD;
      pruritus and discuss and assess its effectiveness. For this, the investigators will recruit&#xD;
      150 patients to validate the application potential of the AST-120 in the cutaneous pruritus&#xD;
      brought about by uremia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Uremic toxins, such as indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresol, or p-cresyl sulfate (PCS), are&#xD;
      markedly accumulated in the organs of chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. These toxins can&#xD;
      induce inflammatory reactions and enhance oxidative stress, prompting glomerular sclerosis&#xD;
      and interstitial fibrosis, to aggravate the decline of renal function. Consequently, uremic&#xD;
      toxins play an important role in the worsening of renal and cardiovascular functions.&#xD;
      Furthermore, they destroy the quantity and quality of bone. Oral sorbent AST-120 reduces&#xD;
      serum levels of uremic toxins in CKD patients by adsorbing the precursors of IS and PCS&#xD;
      generated by amino acid metabolism in the intestine. Accordingly, AST-120 decreases the serum&#xD;
      IS levels and reduces the production of reactive oxygen species by endothelial cells, to&#xD;
      impede the subsequent oxidative stress. This slows the progression of cardiovascular and&#xD;
      renal diseases and improves bone metabolism in CKD patients. Although large-scale studies&#xD;
      showed no obvious benefits from adding AST-120 to the standard therapy for CKD patients,&#xD;
      subsequent sporadic studies may support its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pruritus is a common and distressing symptom that affects patients with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease (CKD). Indoxyl sulfate (IS) and p-cresyl sulfate (PCS) are uremic toxins with similar&#xD;
      protein binding, dialytic clearance, and proinflammatory features. The pathogenesis of uremic&#xD;
      pruritus is not well elucidated, although it is theorized that inflammation may play a role.&#xD;
      Elevated levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6, and interleukin-2 have been found&#xD;
      among patients on hemodialysis suffering from pruritus, which may also partly explain the&#xD;
      association the investigators found between low hemoglobin levels and a higher prevalence of&#xD;
      pruritus, given the association between low hemoglobin and inflammatory states. Since the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of uremic pruritus is multifactorial. Subclinical or overt uremic neuropathy,&#xD;
      skin or nerve inflammation in the context of kidney failure-associated chronic systemic&#xD;
      inflammation, or an increase in activity of Î¼-opioid receptors due to kidney failure have all&#xD;
      been implicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large, international study demonstrated the prevalence of moderate-to-extreme pruritus&#xD;
      among patients with end-stage kidney disease on hemodialysis to be approximately 40% and was&#xD;
      associated with a higher prevalence of comorbid conditions, worse biochemical profiles,&#xD;
      poorer mental and physical quality of life, a higher probability of depression, and poorer&#xD;
      sleep quality and survival. More recently, this prevalence was shown to range from 26% in&#xD;
      Germany to 48% in the United Kingdom. Other studies have also demonstrated an association&#xD;
      between pruritus and worse kidney disease burden scores, poorer health-related quality of&#xD;
      life, and greater frequency of sleep disturbances in patients on dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, pruritus is often overlooked by health care providers within dialysis units. In&#xD;
      dialysis facilities where 21%-50% of patients reported having severe pruritus, only 1% of&#xD;
      medical directors estimated this same prevalence. This may be due, in part, to underreporting&#xD;
      by patients, as 17% of patients who were nearly always or always bothered by pruritus had not&#xD;
      reported their symptoms to any health care provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uremic pruritus intensity is also associated with multiple health-related quality-of-life&#xD;
      outcomes, such as sleep quality, mood, and social function, and is independently associated&#xD;
      with mortality. Uremic pruritus has been identified as a key research priority by patients&#xD;
      with kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several small studies have examined a variety of interventions, the efficacy of&#xD;
      these interventions and the optimal treatments remain poorly defined. To address this&#xD;
      important knowledge gap, the investigators systematically reviewed the literature and&#xD;
      summarized the evidence for the major interventions for the treatment of uremic pruritus. The&#xD;
      investigators will choose AST-120 as therapeutic agents for uremic pruritus.&#xD;
