Additionally, Cancer Control Navigators (CNNs) housed at 2-1-1 call centers aid callers. CNNs receive electronic summary profiles of participants assigned to navigation. Navigators call the participant, build a collaborative relationship with them, identify their needs, work with them to identify barriers to services and coordinate solutions, and provide logistic (e.g., making appointments) and emotional support. Navigation services are provided by telephone only.</description>
