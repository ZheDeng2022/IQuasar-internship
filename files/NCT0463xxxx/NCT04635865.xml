      Objectives: The aim of this randomised controlled clinical trial is to evaluate surgical&#xD;
      accuracy and efficiency of computer-assisted jaw reconstruction using 3D-printed&#xD;
      patient-specific titanium surgical plates versus conventional plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis to be tested: The investigators hypothesize that compared to conventional surgical&#xD;
      plates, 3D-printed patient-specific surgical plates improve surgical accuracy and efficiency&#xD;
      of computer assisted jaw reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and subjects: This is an open-label, prospective, double-arm, and single-centre&#xD;
      randomised controlled clinical trial. Patients with maxillary or mandibular neoplastic,&#xD;
      inflammatory and congenital diseases who require immediate or secondary reconstructive&#xD;
      surgery will be invited to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study instruments: 3D-printed patient-specific titanium surgical plates and conventional&#xD;
      plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Outcome Measures: The primary endpoint is the accuracy of reconstruction. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include the accuracy of osteotomy, reconstruction time, total operative time,&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss, length of post-operative hospital stay, and postoperative adverse&#xD;
      events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The accuracy parameters, reconstruction time, total operative time,&#xD;
      intraoperative blood loss, length of post-operative hospital stay will be presented as mean&#xD;
      values with standard deviations. The post-operative adverse events will be calculated and&#xD;
      presented as frequency with standard deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results: This randomised control trial will prove improved accuracy and efficiency&#xD;
      of reconstruction using 3D printed patient-specific titanium surgical plates. This study is&#xD;
      expected to provide high-level evidence to push forward the popularity of using 3D medical&#xD;
      printing technology in surgical field.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomised controlled clinical trial was based on our previous clinical trial&#xD;
      &quot;Three-Dimensional Printing of Patient-Specific Titanium Plates in Jaw Surgery: A Pilot&#xD;
      Study&quot; (HKU/HA HKW IRB, No. UW 16-315; registered in ClinicalTrials.gov with a No. of&#xD;
      NCT03057223; supported by HMRF Project no.: 05161626).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past few decades, autologous vascularized bone flaps have become the preferred&#xD;
      choice for head and neck reconstruction. The anastomosed blood supply endows vascularized&#xD;
      bone flaps with improved survival rate and inherent anti-infection performance. Along with&#xD;
      the development of microvascular surgery, surgeons are seeking more accurate reconstruction&#xD;
      to enhance better aesthetic and functional outcomes. However, a main disadvantage of&#xD;
      autologous bone flaps is the mismatch in the shape of donor bone, which need to be cut and&#xD;
      trimmed to fit the defects and better restore the natural appearance. Much efforts have been&#xD;
      devoted to facilitate bone manipulations, and then the computer-assisted surgery (CAS)&#xD;
      emerged in the 21st century as a viable option. In CAS, surgeons do virtual plans in&#xD;
      computer, which then guide the precise harvest and arrangement of bone segments for repairing&#xD;
      defects in the operating theatre. Bone segments can be fine-navigated to best restore the&#xD;
      original skeleton. In previous researches, various devices have been developed to navigate&#xD;
      bone segments according to virtual plans, including cutting templates, skull models, and&#xD;
      surgical navigation system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the missing link between bone navigation and accurate reconstruction is the plate&#xD;
      fixation procedure. In a conventional manner, bone segments are fixed using commercial&#xD;
      off-the-shelf titanium plates, which should be manually bent and twisted to fit bone anatomy.&#xD;
      The manual contouring process is often tedious and technique-demanding, and adversely affect&#xD;
      the precise location of bone segments. What's worse, repeated bending can even lead to poor&#xD;
      fatigue performance. The disadvantages of conventional surgical plates make it necessary to&#xD;
      develop patient-specific surgical plates. Compared to conventional plates, patient-specific&#xD;
      surgical plates are designed and manufactured in 3D structures aligned with individual bone&#xD;
      contours. Instead of contouring plates based on anatomical structure of bones in conventional&#xD;
      plates, patient-specific surgical plates navigate the folding and precise location of bone&#xD;
      segments, and hopefully improve the accuracy of reconstruction. Meanwhile, since no plate&#xD;
      bending is required, patient-specific surgical plates can be used to optimize bone&#xD;
      reconstruction in a more efficient and standardized manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, with the rapid development of additive manufacturing (3D printing), it is&#xD;
      now feasible to manufacture patient-specific metal implants with topologically optimized&#xD;
      structures. Many efforts have been made to develop porous bone scaffolds for regenerative&#xD;
      medicine, which are endowed with customized porosity to achieve optimal biomechanical&#xD;
      properties. However, although additively manufactured bone scaffolds demonstrate excellent&#xD;
      performance in some complicated cases, they still cannot replace the dominant role of&#xD;
      autologous vascularized bone flaps in head and neck reconstruction. Therefore, it is of&#xD;
      crucial importance to explore the application of additive manufactured (3D printed)&#xD;
      patient-specific surgical plates, albeit not much research has been done in this direction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our previous study (HKU/HA HKW IRB, No. UW 16-315) supported by Health and Medical&#xD;
      Research Fund (Project no.: 05161626), the investigators have successfully manufactured&#xD;
      patient-specific titanium plates with high precision through selective laser melting (SLM)&#xD;
      technology, which is a high-tech 3D printing technology that fully melts titanium powders&#xD;
      into complete entities in the layer by layer manner. SLM enables the fabrication of&#xD;
      patient-specific titanium surgical plates with tailored structures and outstanding&#xD;
      biomechanical properties. Our results showed promising clinical outcomes in the application&#xD;
      of 3D printed patient-specific titanium plates in head and neck reconstruction. Furthermore,&#xD;
      the investigators did a retrospective study comparing the patients who had undergone jaw&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery using 3D printed patient-specific surgical plates versus conventional&#xD;
      titanium plates and the result showed superior accuracy of reconstruction outcomes in the&#xD;
      study group with the use of 3D printed patient-specific surgical plates. However, there were&#xD;
      significant limitations in our study. First, as a retrospective study, the innate flaw of&#xD;
      study design was unavoidable, such as selection bias. Second, there was significantly&#xD;
      difference in follow-up periods between the study group and control group. The imaging data&#xD;
      used for accuracy analysis were obtained during different post-operative periods, which&#xD;
      compromised the final outcomes. Finally, surgical efficiency endpoints, such as operation&#xD;
      time, blood loss, and post-operative hospital stay, which could be significantly affected by&#xD;
      multiple confounding factors, are difficult to control by retrospective study design. Hence,&#xD;
      there is still lack of high-level evidence concerning the advantages of 3D printed&#xD;
      patient-specific surgical plates in head and neck reconstruction. Whether 3D printed&#xD;
      patient-specific surgical plates improve surgical accuracy and efficiency compared to&#xD;
      conventional plates in computer assisted jaw reconstruction should be further investigated&#xD;
      before large-scale clinical application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators aim to evaluate surgical accuracy and efficiency of&#xD;
      computer-assisted jaw reconstruction using 3D-printed patient-specific titanium surgical&#xD;
      plates versus conventional plates in a prospective randomised controlled clinical trial. Our&#xD;
      study is expected to provide high-level evidence to push forward the popularity of using 3D&#xD;
      medical printing new technology in the surgical field.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology has already been set up and has been proved feasible in our earlier studies.&#xD;
      The PI has been working on computer aided surgical simulation, virtual planning, and 3D&#xD;
      printed surgical templates in the maxillofacial surgery for several years and has published a&#xD;
      series of articles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Computer-assisted Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
           The CAS techniques used in head and neck reconstruction are well established in our unit&#xD;
           and have been described previously. Briefly, CAS is composed of three main phases: the&#xD;
           pre-operative phase of the virtual surgery and 3D printing of patient-specific devices,&#xD;
           intra-operative phase involving precision-enhanced surgery to install the&#xD;
           patient-specific devices, and post-operative phase involving the accuracy analysis. The&#xD;
           patient-specific devices can include cutting guides, positioning guides, and the&#xD;
           patient-specific titanium plates. In our trial, the study group will use cutting guides&#xD;
           and patient-specific titanium plates, whereas the control group will use cutting guides,&#xD;
           positioning guides, and conventional plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the pre-operative phase, the virtual surgery will be performed by surgeons using the&#xD;
           ProPlan CMF 2.0 software (Materialise, Leuven, Belgium). The patient's CT data is&#xD;
           initially segmented to rebuild 3D virtual models of the maxilla or mandible using&#xD;
           ProPlan's interactive interface. Next, bone resection is performed in the 3D models for&#xD;
           en bloc removal of any tumours. Meanwhile, bone grafts are harvested from fibula or&#xD;
           iliac crest to repair defects and restore the normal appearance. Finally, the virtually&#xD;
           reconstructed maxilla or mandible is used to design patient-specific devices to navigate&#xD;
           the bone segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Additive Manufacturing of Patient-specific Devices&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compared to the conventional approach of designing patient-specific devices using&#xD;
           engineering companies, we have adopt an in-house approach that allow the surgeons to&#xD;
           design and manufacture the devices. All patient-specific devices are designed in 3-matic&#xD;
           13.0 (Materialise). Cutting guides, which guide and adapt to bone surface for accurate&#xD;
           bone resection, are generated by wrapping to the bone surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the study group, patient-specific surgical plates are designed by delineating the&#xD;
           plate path on the bone surface, followed by the placement of screw holes. Surgical&#xD;
           plates are generated by a built-in command in 3-matic. Next, the surgical plates are&#xD;
           fabricated by SLM using grade 2 titanium powder. For the control group, positioning&#xD;
           guides will be designed for the bone segment alignment and inset.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Both cutting and positioning guides will be additively manufactured by Fused Deposition&#xD;
           Manufacturing (FDM) using ULTEM 1010, or by Stereolithography using MED610 resin&#xD;
           (Stratasys Ltd, Eden Prairie, MN, USA). Both ULTEM 1010 and MED610 are FDA cleared&#xD;
           biocompatible materials usable in high-temperature autoclaving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surgical Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the present study, all patients in both groups will undergo CAS carried out by the&#xD;
           same chief surgeon (PI). During the surgery, patient-specific cutting guides will enable&#xD;
           precise jawbone resection and bone flap osteotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the control group, the arrangement of bone segments will be manipulated according to&#xD;
           the positioning guide. Bone segments will be stabilized using commercial titanium&#xD;
           surgical plates (DePuy Synthes, United States), which are bent manually before fastening&#xD;
           with screws. In the study group, patient-specific surgical plates will be designed and&#xD;
           fabricated to custom-fit the bone contours of reconstructed maxilla or mandible. The&#xD;
           screw holes embedded in cutting guides correspond to the 3D-printed patient-specific&#xD;
           surgical plates, which will guide the position of surgical plates and bone segments,&#xD;
           thereby facilitating folding, positioning, and fixation of bone segments in the real&#xD;
           surgery. Standard peri-operative management will be similar in both groups.&#xD;
           Post-operative follow-up will be conducted in a routine manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Data collection procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      CT scan will be obtained at baseline (before surgery) and post-operatively (within 1 month&#xD;
      after the surgery). The accuracy of reconstruction will be independently assessed by two&#xD;
      assessors. Training will be provided using previous cases, and calibration between the two&#xD;
      assessors will be done with the aim of achieving over 90% inter-assessor agreement in three&#xD;
      consecutive training cases before starting the measurement of subject cases in this study.&#xD;
      Other information such as reconstruction time, total operative time, intra-operative blood&#xD;
      loss, length of post-operative hospital stay, and post-operative adverse events will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
