      The main aim of the study is to discover the mechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      NAFLD in obese youth.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is the most common hepatic disease in pediatrics,&#xD;
      affecting about 30% of obese youth. The term NAFLD defines a wide spectrum of disease&#xD;
      severity ranging from simple intrahepatic fat accumulation without liver injury (steatosis)&#xD;
      to nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), fibrosis and cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 20-year retrospective study has shown that subjects who develop NAFLD during their youth&#xD;
      have about 13 times higher mortality rate for end-stage liver disease than healthy subjects&#xD;
      of similar age and gender. NAFLD is highly prevalent among Hispanic youth, while non-Hispanic&#xD;
      Black (NHB) youth are protected against intrahepatic fat accumulation even in the presence of&#xD;
      severe obesity and insulin resistance. Understanding the pathophysiology underlying these&#xD;
      differences could shed new light on the mechanisms leading to NAFLD in obese youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data suggest that Hispanic and NHB obese youth might have a different ability to&#xD;
      metabolize carbohydrates (CHO) through glycolysis, with Hispanics showing higher glycolysis&#xD;
      than NHB. Therefore, Hispanics might experience a higher rated tricyclic acid cycle (TCA) and&#xD;
      hepatic de novo lipogenesis (DNL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study, the investigators aim to address the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Is the different susceptibility between Hispanics and NHB in developing NAFLD due to a&#xD;
           higher capability of Hispanics to metabolize CHO through glycolysis, TCA cycle and DNL?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Do these metabolic changes anticipate the onset of the disease in Hispanic youth?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Are the higher rates of glycolysis, TCA and DNL driven by high but not pathologic&#xD;
           changes in glucose levels over time?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these aims, the investigators plan to recruit 30 Hispanics and 30 NHB obese youth&#xD;
      and to measure glycolysis by using a new method to assess lactate kinetics and to determine&#xD;
      the TCA cycle and DNL by using 13C-Propionate and D2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also assess glycolysis and intrahepatic fat content in a group of&#xD;
      200Hispanic obese youth without fatty liver at baseline every 12 months for two years to&#xD;
      determine whether higher glycolytic rates precede intrahepatic fat accumulation. To assess&#xD;
      whether metabolic changes in glycolysis are driven by higher but not-pathologic glucose&#xD;
      levels, the investigators will measure glucose changes over ten days every six months by&#xD;
      using a continuous glucose monitoring system. If successful, these studies will provide novel&#xD;
      insight into the pathogenesis of pediatric NAFLD and will open new avenues to test novel&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches.&#xD;
