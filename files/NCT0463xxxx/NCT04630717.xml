  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose to evaluate the analgesic effect of medical hypnosis prior to the&#xD;
      pharmacological induction of general anesthesia versus a classical pharmacological induction&#xD;
      of anesthesia. Monitoring of the NOL index (Nociception index) as well as all the other&#xD;
      classical parameters under general anesthesia (heart rate, blood pressure etc) will allow&#xD;
      evaluation of the level of nociception related to oro-tracheal intubation as well as the one&#xD;
      related to standardized electrical tetanic stimulation during general anesthesia and before&#xD;
      surgical incision, between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators know from the literature that the use of medical hypnosis in combination&#xD;
      with anesthetic drugs allows for a significant reduction of hypnotic and opioid drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim here at evaluating the real and objective impact of pre-anesthesia&#xD;
      hypnosis on intraoperative nociception by using the NOL index which has been developed and&#xD;
      used recently to better detect nociceptive stimuli under anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial will provide an objective answer on the analgesic properties of&#xD;
      intraoperative hypnosis. If this is confirmed, hypnosis could find its place in the&#xD;
      management of perioperative nociception around general anesthesia.&#xD;

      Study Design: Prospective randomized double-blind, mono-centric trial (patient does not know&#xD;
      if the conversation is hypnotic or not, the anesthesiologist in charge during the case is not&#xD;
      here during the preoperative conversation and is not the one doing the medical conversational&#xD;
      hypnosis or standard conversation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to answer two questions :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the difference in the variation of the NOL index (delta NOL) after&#xD;
           standardized electrical stimulation performed after tracheal intubation under general&#xD;
           anesthesia between two types of anesthetic induction : pharmacological induction&#xD;
           associated with a brief session of medical hypnosis versus a standard pharmacological&#xD;
           induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure variation of heart rate, arterial pressure, BISpectral index after&#xD;
           intubation, standardized electrical stimulation, incision and other intraoperative&#xD;
           surgical stimuli. Evaluation of postoperative pain, analgesic consumption in the&#xD;
           recovery room, and recovery room discharge time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           50 Adults scheduled for elective laparoscopic surgery under general anesthesia expected&#xD;
           to last less than 3 hours will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed and included the day before surgery. Randomization will be done by&#xD;
      web-base-systeme-algorithm dividing patients into two groups: general anesthesia alone or&#xD;
      general anesthesia coupled with hypnosis. No premedication will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypnotherapist will meet briefly with the patient before admission to the operating room&#xD;
      to introduce himself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the patient enters the operating room, a checklist is performed by the staff, the usual&#xD;
      monitoring is set up (electrocardiogram, pulse oximeter, non-invasive blood pressure, muscle&#xD;
      relaxation monitor, bispectral index, NOL index). Nasoparyngeal temperature and monitoring of&#xD;
      expired carbon dioxide will be placed following tracheal intubation to allow monitoring of&#xD;
      normothermia and normo capnia intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PMD200TM monitor and the BIS index will be connected to the patient. Registration of the&#xD;
      index NOL will be done continuously via the PMD200TM monitor, which will be switched on at&#xD;
      the start of the procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When everything is ready for pharmacological induction the anesthesiologist in charge will&#xD;
      leave the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control arm the therapist will have a standard discussion to check all things are all&#xD;
      right with the patient before pharmacological induction starts. No hypnotic conversation will&#xD;
      be proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the hypnosis arm a short session of hypnosis will be done before the pharmacological&#xD;
      induction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of discussion in both the groups will be between 6 and 15 minutes, hypnotic or&#xD;
      not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, the anesthesiologist will be called for pharmacological induction of general&#xD;
      anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol of anesthesia will be the same in both groups : the induction will be done by&#xD;
      propofol (with a goal of Bispectral index : 40-60) and Remifentanil (with goal of NOL &lt; 25),&#xD;
      and muscle relaxation with Rocuronium (0.8 mg.kg-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After tracheal intubation, the remifentanil will be discontinued. After a period of at least&#xD;
      10 minutes after remifentanil discontinuation, a standardized tetanic stimulation (70mA,&#xD;
      100Hz, 30 seconds at the ulnar level) will be applied and all the anesthesia parameters and&#xD;
      NOL index will be electronically recorded every 5 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this stimulation, general anesthesia will be maintained as follows: sevoflurane inhaled&#xD;
      anesthesia for a bispectral index between 40-60; remifentanil analgesia for a NOL index&#xD;
      between 5-25; rocuronium for a muscle relaxation with TOF index between 1-3. Total&#xD;
      consumption of remifentanil during the case will be monitored and calculated in mcg.kg-1 per&#xD;
      hour of surgery as it will be a surrogate of intraoperative pain/nociception that will be&#xD;
      analyzed too. At the end of surgery, anesthesia is discontinued, hydromorphone 7mcg.kg-1 will&#xD;
      be administered at the end of skin closure in anticipation of postoperative pain.&#xD;
      Acetaminophen will also be given PR at the end of surgery as well as intravenous ketorolac.&#xD;
      Skin incisions for laparoscopic surgery will be infiltrated with 0.5% bupivacaine (maximum&#xD;
      20mL). Once the patient extubated, she/he will be transferred to post anesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (PACU) where classical pain management will be offered. Pain scores in PACU, patients'&#xD;
      satisfaction, opioid consumption will be evaluated between the two groups in PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The main outcome analyzed will be the delta NOL or the variation of the NOL&#xD;
      index between pre and post stimulation in the two groups. The mean maximum value of the NOL&#xD;
      index after stimulation will also be compared between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed using SAS version 9.4 or higher and will be performed&#xD;
      at a bilateral significance level of 0.05, unless otherwise specified. Descriptive statistics&#xD;
      of central tendency (e.g., mean and 95% CI, median) and dispersion (SD, frequency table) will&#xD;
      be used to describe the characteristics of the patients in each group of the study. The&#xD;
      intraoperative data collected in the groups will be compared using parametric (e.g. Student's&#xD;
      t-test) or non-parametric (e.g. Mann-Withney's U-test, Chi-square test) tests depending on&#xD;
      the type of variables and their distribution.&#xD;
