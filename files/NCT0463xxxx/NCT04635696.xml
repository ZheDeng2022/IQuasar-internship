  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Negative pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been shown to improve wound care outcomes for&#xD;
      acute and chronic wounds as well as for surgical incision sites. We have found that patients&#xD;
      report significant pain during dressing changes specifically with the removal of the clear&#xD;
      adhesive drape. Upon review of the literature, there were multiple studies related to pain&#xD;
      and the removal of the sponge (filler) but limited studies relating to the pain associated&#xD;
      with the removal of the drape. The patient reported pain with drape removal has led to&#xD;
      increased psychological stress and decreased compliance with the dressing change protocol.&#xD;
      Application of a topical anesthetic to the drape during the dressing change has the potential&#xD;
      to decrease the pain experienced by the patient. An FDA approved ethyl chloride spray is a&#xD;
      topical anesthetic that can be sprayed onto the outer perimeter of the drape during the&#xD;
      dressing change as a means to decrease pain. We hypothesize that the use of ethyl chloride&#xD;
      spray will result in patients experiencing less pain leading to decreased psychological&#xD;
      stress, improved compliance with dressing changes, and overall improved customer&#xD;
      satisfaction.&#xD;
