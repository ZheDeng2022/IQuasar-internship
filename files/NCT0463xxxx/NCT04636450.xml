    <textblock>
      In this study, the aim is to compare manual and rotatory pulpectomy techniques on 100 primary&#xD;
      mandibular molars on children between the ages of 4 and 8 years. The plan is to conduct a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial with a 1:1 ratio for group allocation at a teaching university&#xD;
      pediatric dentistry clinic between January 2021 and December 2021. Two manual systems, as&#xD;
      well as two rotary systems, will be randomly assigned. The adult manual system used will be&#xD;
      K-file and the adult rotary system will be K3. The pediatric manual system used in this study&#xD;
      will be Kedo-SH, while the pediatric rotary system will be Kedo-S. The observed outcome&#xD;
      measures in this study are the following: 1) instrumentation and filling time; 2) filling&#xD;
      quality by radiographic evaluation; 3) postoperative pain levels using the visual analog&#xD;
      scale at 12 and 24 hours; and 4) frequency of complications (e.g. fistulas, thinning of the&#xD;
      mesiodistal walls, periapical or furcation radiolucency) after a 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dental caries is a prevalent chronic disease, affecting 60-90% of school-age children in&#xD;
      industrialized countries; although in the last four decades the prevalence and severity of&#xD;
      caries lesions have decreased, it is still a frequent disease for this age group. The&#xD;
      American Dental Association (ADA) classifies dental caries by clinical presentation as&#xD;
      initial, moderate, and severe; furthermore, the ADA classifies the disease using the&#xD;
      international caries detection and diagnosis system (ICDAS II; International Caries Detection&#xD;
      and Assessment System II) and by a radiographic presentation of the proximal faces based on&#xD;
      the E0-E2, D1-D3 notation system. Within the non-vital pulp treatments, pulpectomy is&#xD;
      indicated in temporary teeth; pulpectomy is a conventional endodontic treatment for teeth&#xD;
      with exposed, infected, and/or necrotic tissue to eliminate pulp and periradicular infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent systematic review that compared three different strategies for the management of&#xD;
      deep caries lesions (i.e. complete caries removal, selective caries removal, and step caries&#xD;
      removal), Aïem and colleagues (2020) report an increased restoration failure risk when&#xD;
      selective removal is used compared to complete removal of caries. In a study where French&#xD;
      dentists were surveyed on the management of deep caries lesions in primary dentition, the&#xD;
      majority of respondents mentioned performing deep caries removal in a single step. Endodontic&#xD;
      procedures in the pediatric population can assist to keep temporary teeth until exfoliation,&#xD;
      which is a key principle of pediatric dentistry. Vital pulp and non-vital pulp treatments are&#xD;
      employed in the treatment of severe lesions and deep caries; meanwhile, pulpectomy is a&#xD;
      treatment largely used in the primary dentition. In pulp therapy, a pulpotomy is performed by&#xD;
      removing the pulp from the chamber, while in a pulpectomy, all the tissue from both the&#xD;
      chamber and the root canals is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two parameters used to determine root canal treatment success: 1) the morphology&#xD;
      and shaping of the canal; and 2) the duct cleanliness or the adequate level of disinfection&#xD;
      provided by the type and quantity of intra-canal irrigation (e.g. chlorhexidine, sodium&#xD;
      hypochlorite, citric acid, profuse irrigation). A pulpectomy is the technique of choice for&#xD;
      primary dentition in deep carious lesions with pulp necrosis since pulpectomy has a higher&#xD;
      success rate than pulpotomy. While the time for access to the root canal is less with the use&#xD;
      of rotary instrumentation systems compared to a manual technique, manual techniques have the&#xD;
      same efficacy as rotary systems in root canal cleaning procedures. Rotary systems have&#xD;
      greater clinical success compared to manual techniques, in addition to having advantages in&#xD;
      instrumentation time, canal shaping, reduction in working time, better cooperation and less&#xD;
      patient fatigue, improvement in the conicity of the root canal, and promoting a higher&#xD;
      quality of obturation. In a recent meta-analysis, Manchanda and colleagues (2020) conclude&#xD;
      that rotary instrumentation has similar clinical and radiographic success rates to manual&#xD;
      techniques in primary dentition; additionally, rotatory techniques show lower levels of&#xD;
      postoperative pain and less instrumentation time. In the only study in the Mexican population&#xD;
      that compared a rotary system (i.e. K3) against a manual technique (i.e. K-file) it was found&#xD;
      that the instrumentation and obturation time was shorter, being a promising technique in&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the limited comparative literature about rotatory techniques used in pulpectomy&#xD;
      treatment, it is necessary to conduct clinical trials that compare both manual and rotatory&#xD;
      techniques in first dentition treatment. So far, studies have been carried out comparing&#xD;
      rotary systems designed for adults in the pediatric population. Recently, interest to&#xD;
      validate and implement safe and effective protocols for the management of rotary systems in&#xD;
      primary dentition has emerged in pediatric dentistry. Below is a protocol designed to&#xD;
      investigate the advantages and disadvantages associated with the use of rotary systems&#xD;
      designed for our population of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;

      PICOS framework&#xD;
&#xD;
      P: pediatric population&#xD;
&#xD;
      I: manual system pulpectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      C: rotary system pulpectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      O: instrumentation and obturation time, filling quality by radiographic evaluation,&#xD;
      postoperative pain levels at 12hr and 24hr, frequency of complications (e.g. fistulas,&#xD;
      thinning of the mesiodistal walls, periapical or furcation radiolucency) after a 3-, 6-, 9-,&#xD;
      and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S: a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      Are there differences between the use of a manual system compared to a rotary system in the&#xD;
      pediatric population?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compare the performance between a manual technique and a rotatory technique during&#xD;
      biomechanical work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Particular objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the instrumentation (i.e. during biomechanical work) and filling time between a&#xD;
           manual technique and a rotatory technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare the filling quality by radiographic evaluation between a manual technique and a&#xD;
           rotatory technique at the end of the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare postoperative pain levels using the visual analog scale at 12 and 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compare the frequency of complications (e.g. fistulas, thinning of the mesiodistal&#xD;
           walls, periapical or furcation radiolucency) after a 3-, 6-, 9-, and 12-month follow-up&#xD;
           between the two techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: The rotatory techniques will take less instrumentation and obturation time than the&#xD;
      manual techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: The quality of the obturation in the rotatory technique will be reported radiographically&#xD;
      more frequently as optimal than the manual technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: The pain levels reported by patients will be lower in the rotatory technique than in the&#xD;
      manual technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: The rotatory technique will have a lower frequency of complications such as fistulas,&#xD;
      thinning of the mesiodistal walls, periapical or furcation radiolucency at each time point&#xD;
      compared to the manual technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be performed on all variables. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using SPSS 25 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL). All variables will be examined to determine&#xD;
      the existence of outliers and whether or not they meet the Gaussian distribution assumption;&#xD;
      furthermore, Gaussian distribution will be determined with the Shapiro-Wilk test and by&#xD;
      visualizing the data through histograms and Q-Q graphs. The demographic and clinical&#xD;
      variables will be summarized in proportions and percentages. Nominal variables will be&#xD;
      evaluated with Chi-square tests to assess differences between groups. Categorical variables&#xD;
      will be evaluated to determine statistical inferences with the Mann-Whitney test. Continuous&#xD;
      variables will be assessed for statistical inferences using t-tests and Levene's test to&#xD;
      assess variance equality. Statistical significance will be set at p= 0.05 and a Bonferroni&#xD;
      correction will be made for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size necessary to detect statistically significant differences was calculated by&#xD;
      taking the following parameters; α = 0.05 and statistical power of 0.8 (i.e. 1-β). For the&#xD;
      calculation of the sample size, the time of instrumentation was used as a measure of clinical&#xD;
      outcome. The sample was calculated based on the article by Ochoa-Romero and colleagues (2011)&#xD;
      where instrumentation time was used as the primary outcome. The sample calculator used can be&#xD;
      found on the website: https://clincalc.com/stats/samplesize.aspx. The calculator designed for&#xD;
      two independent groups for continuous variables was selected, using the mean for each group&#xD;
      (i.e. group 1: rotatory technique 1.7 minutes ± 0.5; group 2: manual technique 2.5 minutes ±&#xD;
      0.8) taking into account an enrollment 1:1 ratio for this study. The total sample size was 24&#xD;
      teeth (i.e. at least 6 teeth per group to find statistically significant differences in&#xD;
      instrumentation time).&#xD;
