  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry eye disease (DED) is a common sequelae of graft versus host disease (GVHD) after&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). Since Ikervis is reported to&#xD;
      be a safe and efficacious treatment of DED associated with chronic GVHD, our study would like&#xD;
      to study the efficacy of prophlactic Ikervis in preventing ocular GVHD development.&#xD;

      This is a prospective single arm interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment period will be over 12-18 months to enroll all suitable patients. The total&#xD;
      duration of prophylaxis will be for 1 year. After completion of the period of prophylaxis,&#xD;
      the patients will be followed up as a non-study patient as clinically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty subjects, undergoing allo-HSCT, will be recruited from the Singapore National Eye&#xD;
      Centre upon referral from the Department of Hematology, Singapore General Hospital and&#xD;
      followed up at least 5 times over a period of 12 months at the Singapore Eye Research&#xD;
      Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images of the subject eyes will be recorded and stored electronically. These images&#xD;
      (corneal fluorescein staining score, Lipiview, meibography, conjunctival redness, tear&#xD;
      stability assessment) will be used in the analysis of outcome measures. The Lipiview result&#xD;
      is in video format.&#xD;
