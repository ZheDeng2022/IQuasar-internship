    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multi-center, non-randomized, single arm observational study. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate functional responder rates&#xD;
      with an objective performance criteria (OPC) of 85% as measured by the KOOS questionnaire for&#xD;
      the first 225 tibia (CR FB and PS FB combined) implanted with the ATTUNE Cementless FB tray&#xD;
      (primary and revision procedures) and will be analyzed when these patients have passed the 1&#xD;
      year preferred post-op window.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this clinical investigation is to evaluate functional responder&#xD;
      rates with an objective performance criteria (OPC) of 85% as measured by the KOOS&#xD;
      questionnaire for the first 225 tibia (CR FB and PS FB combined) implanted with the ATTUNE&#xD;
      Cementless FB tray (primary and revision procedures) and will be analyzed when these patients&#xD;
      have passed the 1 year preferred post-op window. Study success will be determined using the&#xD;
      primary TKA (CR FB and PS FB combined) analysis group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are to establish the surgical effectiveness of the&#xD;
      ATTUNE Cementless Tibial Base and Cementless Patella by evaluating type and frequency of&#xD;
      Adverse Events and Device Deficiencies, functional responder rates with an objective&#xD;
      performance criteria (OPC) of 85% as measured by the KOOS questionnaire for all subjects (CR&#xD;
      FB and PS FB combined) at the 1-year timepoint, the change from preoperative baseline to the&#xD;
      6-week, 6-month, 1-year, 2-year and 5-year timepoints in functional outcomes and quality of&#xD;
      life assessments, as measured using additional patient reported outcomes measures (PROMS),&#xD;
      implant survivorship of the ATTUNE Cementless FB Tibial base and Cementless Patella using&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis at 1, 2 and 5-year timepoints, and investigator-conducted&#xD;
      radiographic analysis of the tibial and patellar components at 6 weeks/6 months 1, 2 and 5&#xD;
      years after surgery.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Forgotten Joint Scores comprise measures for the assessment of joint-specific patient-reported outcome (PRO). These PRO questionnaires focus on patients' awareness of a specific joint in everyday life. Joint awareness can be simply defined as any unintended perception of a joint. This may include strong sensations like pain, but also includes more subtle feelings like mild stiffness, subjective dysfunction, or any discomfort. The FJS-12 score ranges from 0 to 100, with 0 being the worst score and 100 being the best. A higher score means the patient is better able to forget about the artificial joint in daily life. So, the higher the score, the better the outcome is.</description>

             quality (e.g. severe osteoporosis), neuromuscular compromise or vascular deficiency at&#xD;
             the bone site in the affected limb in sufficient degree to render the procedure&#xD;
             unjustifiable (e.g. absence of musculoligamentous supporting structures that could&#xD;
             lead to implant instability, joint neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             i) Severe instability secondary to advanced loss of osteochondral structure or the&#xD;
             absence of collateral ligament integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
             j) The inability to make bone cuts (e.g. inadequate bone stock) so as to assure&#xD;
             correct component position, a firm press fit, and intimate apposition of the cut bone&#xD;
             and prosthetic surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
             k) Subject is currently involved in any personal injury litigation, medical-legal or&#xD;
             worker's compensation claims.&#xD;
