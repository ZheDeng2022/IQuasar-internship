  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and then test an enhanced version of the parent&#xD;
      study's collaborative care intervention for co-occurring disorders (CC-COD) to reduce the&#xD;
      risk of suicide and overdose among individuals with opioid use disorder (OUD) in combination&#xD;
      with PTSD/depression. The parent study is CLARO, Collaboration Leading to Addiction Treatment&#xD;
      and Recovery from Other Stresses (NCT04559893).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      People with OUD co-occurring with depression or PTSD (COD) may not seek out treatment for&#xD;
      their substance use or mental health issues, but they do visit their primary care provider.&#xD;
      However, because providers generally lack specialized training in substance use and mental&#xD;
      illness and are focused on the immediate reason for the visit, patients' substance use and&#xD;
      mental disorders often go unrecognized and untreated. This missed opportunity can have lethal&#xD;
      consequences. Individuals with COD are at higher risk of dying from suicide or overdose than&#xD;
      individuals with mental illness or OUD alone. The parent study (NCT04559893) will provide a&#xD;
      definitive answer as to whether collaborative care (CC) improves access, quality, and&#xD;
      outcomes of care for individuals with COD. While a primary goal is to improve access to and&#xD;
      retention in medication treatment for OUD (MOUD) (which is linked to decreased mortality and&#xD;
      overdose risk), the interventions CC-COD supports do not proactively address suicide or&#xD;
      overdose risk, an important limitation. In addition, CC-COD does not include families in the&#xD;
      patient's care. The investigators address these limitations and tackle the public health&#xD;
      crisis of increasing deaths from suicide and overdose with this study. Because family members&#xD;
      can play an important role in a patient's decision to engage with treatment and in overdose&#xD;
      and suicide prevention, the study team investigates family members' views and use this&#xD;
      information to strengthen CC-COD. This revision will develop and then test the incremental&#xD;
      effectiveness of three additional CC-COD components. Care coordinators will (1) educate&#xD;
      family members about MOUD with the goal of increasing patient retention in treatment; (2)&#xD;
      train family members and the patient to administer naloxone and on how to reduce overdose&#xD;
      risk behaviors; and (3) implement Caring Contacts, a suicide prevention intervention that&#xD;
      sends compassionate mailed or text messages to individuals to decrease social isolation and&#xD;
      reduce suicide risk.&#xD;

    <description>Collaborative care consists of a team of providers that includes a care coordinator, a primary care provider (PCP) and a behavioral health consultant (BHC), who provide evidence- and measurement-based care to a panel of patients using a clinical registry. In this model, the CC team also includes a behavioral health psychotherapist (BHP) who consults on a regular basis but does not deliver direct care. In the Collaborative Care Plus condition, the care coordinator involves family in care, teaches family about naloxone use, and provides Caring Contacts, a suicide prevention method, to patients.</description>
