      The Bialystok Bariatric Surgery Study (BBSS) is a prospective observational cohort study of&#xD;
      patients undergoing bariatric surgery at the First Clinical Department of General and&#xD;
      Endocrine Surgery at the Medical University of Bialystok. The BBSS consists of a battery of&#xD;
      baseline tests established one month prior to the surgery and repeated at one, three, six,&#xD;
      twelve and twenty four-month follow-up clinical visits.&#xD;

        In Bialystok Bariatric Surgery Study (BBSS), we observe a cohort study of patients who&#xD;
        undergo bariatric surgery in the First Clinical Department of General and Endocrine Surgery&#xD;
        of the Medical University of Bialystok. This center performs several types of bariatric&#xD;
        surgery including Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB), adjustable gastric banding (AGB), and&#xD;
        sleeve gastrectomy (SG) in patients referred to the clinic by general practitioners and&#xD;
        endocrinologists and who were qualified for the surgery according to the clinical&#xD;
        physicians. Only patients who agreed to participate in the research project, specified in&#xD;
        detail during written and oral patients consent, are included. Moreover, the study&#xD;
        population consists of the group of obese patients who do not undergo the surgery and are&#xD;
        followed-up without the surgical intervention and the non-obese control group of patients&#xD;
        without obesity.&#xD;
