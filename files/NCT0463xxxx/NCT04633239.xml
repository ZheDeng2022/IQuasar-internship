  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I/Ib trial identifies the side effects and best dose of abemaciclib when given&#xD;
      together with olaparib in treating patients with ovarian cancer that responds at first to&#xD;
      treatment with drugs that contain the metal platinum but then comes back within a certain&#xD;
      period (recurrent platinum-resistant). Abemaciclib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Olaparib is an inhibitor of PARP, an&#xD;
      enzyme that helps repair deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) when it becomes damaged. Blocking PARP&#xD;
      may help keep tumor cells from repairing their damaged DNA, causing them to die. PARP&#xD;
      inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy. Adding abemaciclib to olaparib may work better to&#xD;
      treat recurrent platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of abemaciclib plus olaparib in patients with platinum-resistant&#xD;
      ovarian cancer by determining the maximum tolerated dose and recommended phase 2 dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity using overall response rate (ORR) and duration&#xD;
      of response (DoR) with abemaciclib and olaparib, given in combination, in patients with&#xD;
      platinum-resistant ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess proof of mechanism (RB, phosphoRB, cleaved caspase 3, Ki67, geminin, gamma-H2AX,&#xD;
      RAD51 nuclear foci, pNBS multiplex, Myc transcriptional targets ODC1 and LDHA, homologous&#xD;
      recombination genes BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51, serum thymidine kinase), plasma and tumor&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and subgroups of response (immunohistochemistry [IHC] for Myc, cyclin E;&#xD;
      next generation sequencing [NGS]/whole exome sequencing [WES] for DCAF, hormone receptor [HR]&#xD;
      repair gene alterations, Myc, and CCNE1; ribonucleic acid sequencing [RNAseq] for Myc and&#xD;
      CCNE1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To contribute genetic analysis data from de-identified biospecimens to Genomic Data&#xD;
      Commons (GDC), a well annotated cancer molecular and clinical data repository, for current&#xD;
      and future research; specimens will be annotated with key clinical data, including&#xD;
      presentation, diagnosis, staging, summary treatment, and if possible, outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To bank formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue, blood (for cell-free DNA&#xD;
      analysis), and nucleic acids obtained from patients at the Experimental Therapeutics Clinical&#xD;
      Trials Network (ETCTN) Biorepository at Nationwide Children's Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of abemaciclib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28 and abemaciclib PO BID&#xD;
      on days 8-28 of cycle 1 and days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Cycles repeat every 28 days in&#xD;
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days.&#xD;

             load must be undetectable on suppressive therapy, if indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Active hepatitis B virus (HBV) is defined by a known positive HBV surface antigen&#xD;
                  (HBsAg) result. Patients with a past or resolved HBV infection (defined as the&#xD;
                  presence of hepatitis B core antibody and absence of HBsAg) are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection must have been treated&#xD;
             and cured. For patients with HCV infection who are currently on treatment, they are&#xD;
             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients positive for hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody are eligible only if&#xD;

             tomography [CT] scan) during the screening period&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known history or current symptoms of cardiac disease, or history of&#xD;
             treatment with cardiotoxic agents, should have a clinical risk assessment of cardiac&#xD;
             function using the New York Heart Association Functional Classification. To be&#xD;
             eligible for this trial, patients should be class 2B or better&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Postmenopausal or evidence of non-childbearing status, a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 28 days of study treatment and confirmed prior to treatment on&#xD;
             day 1. Postmenopausal is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Amenorrheic for 1 year or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) levels in the&#xD;
                  postmenopausal range for women under 50&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Radiation-induced oophorectomy with last menses &gt; 1 year ago&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of abemaciclib and olaparib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For&#xD;
             this reason and because CDK-and PARP-inhibiting agents are known to be teratogenic,&#xD;
             women of child-bearing potential and their partners, who are sexually active, must&#xD;
             agree to the use of one highly effective form of contraception and their partner must&#xD;
             use a male condom prior to study entry, for the duration of study participation, and&#xD;
             for 1 month after the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman become pregnant or&#xD;
             suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For the dose expansion cohort, patients must have disease amenable to biopsy for&#xD;
             correlative studies, specifically at least 1 tumor accessible and safe for biopsy on&#xD;
             office exam or tumor that a radiologist deems is safe for biopsy in interventional&#xD;
             radiology department based on imaging (dose expansion cohort only). For the dose&#xD;
             escalation cohort, patients with evaluable disease are acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For inclusion in i) the optional genetic research and ii) the optional biomarker&#xD;
             research, patients must fulfill the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Provision of informed consent for genetic research prior to collection of sample&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Provision of informed consent for biomarker research prior to collection of&#xD;
                  sample&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  If a patient declines to participate in the optional exploratory genetic research&#xD;
                  or the optional biomarker research, there will be no penalty or loss of benefit&#xD;
                  to the patient. The patient will not be excluded from other aspects of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not have received prior CDK 4/6 inhibitors. Previous PARP inhibitor use&#xD;
             is allowed in front-line treatment but not for recurrent disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received chemotherapy must have recovered (Common Terminology Criteria&#xD;
             for Adverse Events [CTCAE] grade =&lt; 1) from the acute effects of chemotherapy except&#xD;
             for residual alopecia or grade 2 peripheral neuropathy prior to randomization. A&#xD;
             washout period of at least 21 days is required between last chemotherapy dose and&#xD;
             randomization (provided the patient did not receive radiotherapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received radiotherapy must have completed and fully recovered from the&#xD;
             acute effects of radiotherapy. A washout period of at least 28 days is required&#xD;
             between end of radiotherapy and randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For agents other than chemotherapy, a 4 week washout period is required. Previous&#xD;
             bevacizumab use is allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;
             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reaction or hypersensitivity attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to abemaciclib, olaparib or any of the excipients of&#xD;
             these products&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant use of known strong CYP3A inhibitors (e.g. itraconazole, telithromycin,&#xD;
             clarithromycin, protease inhibitors boosted with ritonavir or cobicistat, indinavir,&#xD;
             saquinavir, nelfinavir, boceprevir, telaprevir) or moderate CYP3A inhibitors (e.g.&#xD;
             ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, diltiazem, fluconazole, verapamil). The required washout&#xD;
             period prior to starting study treatment is 2 weeks. Because the lists of these agents&#xD;
             are constantly changing, it is important to regularly consult a frequently-updated&#xD;
             medical reference. As part of the enrollment/informed consent procedures, the patient&#xD;
             will be counseled on the risk of interactions with other agents, and what to do if new&#xD;
             medications need to be prescribed or if the patient is considering a new&#xD;
             over-the-counter medicine or herbal product&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because abemaciclib is a CDK-inhibiting&#xD;
             agent and olaparib is a PARP inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or&#xD;
             abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse&#xD;
             events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with abemaciclib and&#xD;
             olaparib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with&#xD;
             abemaciclib and olaparib&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other malignancy unless curatively treated with no evidence of disease for &gt;= 5 years&#xD;
             except: adequately treated non-melanoma skin cancer, curatively treated in situ cancer&#xD;
             of the cervix, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), stage 1, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Resting electrocardiogram (ECG) indicating uncontrolled, potentially reversible&#xD;
             cardiac conditions, as judged by the investigator (e.g., unstable ischemia,&#xD;
             uncontrolled symptomatic arrhythmia, congestive heart failure, corrected QT [QTcF]&#xD;
             prolongation &gt; 500 ms, electrolyte disturbances, ventricular tachycardia and&#xD;
             ventricular fibrillation), or sudden cardiac arrest, etc.), or patients with&#xD;
             congenital long QT syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia or with features&#xD;
             suggestive of myelodysplastic syndrome/acute myeloid leukemia (MDS/AML)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients considered a poor medical risk due to a serious, uncontrolled medical&#xD;
             disorder, non-malignant systemic disease or active, uncontrolled infection that, in&#xD;
             the judgment of the investigator, would preclude participation in this study. Examples&#xD;
             include, but are not limited to, uncontrolled ventricular arrhythmia, recent (within 3&#xD;
             months) myocardial infarction, uncontrolled major seizure disorder, unstable spinal&#xD;
             cord compression, superior vena cava syndrome, extensive interstitial bilateral lung&#xD;
             disease on high resolution computed tomography (HRCT) scan, severe dyspnea at rest or&#xD;
             requiring oxygen therapy, severe renal impairment [e.g. estimated creatinine clearance&#xD;
             &lt; 30 ml/min], history of major surgical resection involving the stomach or small&#xD;
             bowel, or preexisting Crohn's disease or ulcerative colitis or a preexisting chronic&#xD;
             condition resulting in baseline grade 2 or higher diarrhea)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients unable to swallow orally administered medication and patients with&#xD;
             gastrointestinal disorders likely to interfere with absorption of the study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 2 weeks of starting study treatment and patients must have&#xD;
             recovered from any effects of any major surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous allogenic bone marrow transplant or double umbilical cord blood&#xD;
             transplantation (dUCBT)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an active systemic fungal infection&#xD;
