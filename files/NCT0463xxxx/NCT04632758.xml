      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of WX-0593 vs.&#xD;
      crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer who had not received&#xD;
      prior systemic therapy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy and safety of WX-0593 vs. crizotinib in patients with ALK-positive&#xD;
      NSCLC who had not received prior systemic therapy, to obtain additional pharmacokinetic (PK)&#xD;
      data from sparse PK sampling, to compare the quality of life (QoL) in patients receiving&#xD;
      WX-0593 vs. crizotinib, to evaluate the status of exploratory biomarkers and correlate with&#xD;
      clinical outcome, and to obtain germline DNA samples for possible pharmacogenetic analysis in&#xD;
      the event that outliers with respect to efficacy, tolerability/safety, or exposure are&#xD;
      identified.&#xD;
