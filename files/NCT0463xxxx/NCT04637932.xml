    <textblock>
      In this study, our primary goal is to compare whether there is any difference in the&#xD;
      complication of using pro-seal laryngeal mask or intubation tube in bronchoscopy-guided&#xD;
      percutaneous dilation tracheostomy procedure. Our secondary goal is to compare in terms of&#xD;
      processing time.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Following the approval of Muğla Sıtkı Koçman University Clinical Research Ethics Committee,&#xD;
      61 cases over the age of 18 who were scheduled for elective percutaneous dilatation&#xD;
      tracheostomy in intensive care units were included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective percutaneous dilatation tracheostomy cases were randomly divided into two groups.&#xD;
      Group 1 was determined as endotracheal tube and group 2 as pro-seal laryngeal mask group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the endotracheal tube group, which is a conventional method, after entering the trachea&#xD;
      with percutaneous technique, the intubation tube was removed before dilatation and&#xD;
      percutaneous dilatation tracheostomy was performed with the Seldinger method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pro-seal laryngeal mask group, the fiberoptic bronchoscope was advanced with a&#xD;
      pro-seal laryngeal mask, and after the correct position was achieved, percutaneous dilatation&#xD;
      tracheostomy was performed using the Seldinger Method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, heart rate, arterial blood gas, mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation mode, positive end expiratory pressure and mean airway pressure values were&#xD;
      recorded before and 30 minutes after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time until the end of the procedure and complications were determined.&#xD;
