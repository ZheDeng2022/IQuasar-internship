  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Why? The investigators are trying to find out if participants that suddenly deteriorate on&#xD;
      the ward can be identified sooner by wearing a wearable sensor. This is an important study to&#xD;
      see if the sensor works correctly in recording continuous vital observations of heart rate,&#xD;
      respiratory rate and temperature. This information can help doctors and nurses identify&#xD;
      un-well participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What? The investigators will ask the participants to wear a light wearable sensor on the&#xD;
      chest that can be worn for 5 days. If the participants are still in hospital after this time&#xD;
      the sensor can be changed. All sensors are disposable. The participants would not have to&#xD;
      actively do anything to the sensor. We will also participants to complete a short&#xD;
      questionnaire about the sensor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Who? All participants on the ward that are admitted with a new medical or surgical problem&#xD;
      can take part in the study. Participants undergoing a surgical procedure that require at&#xD;
      least one overnight stay are eligible to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where? This study is being conducted at West Middlesex University Hospital and St Marys&#xD;
      Hospital Paddington. Only certain wards are being included at both sites, if the participant&#xD;
      moves wards the sensor will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      How? The study will last around 5 years and we aim to recruit 1000 participants.&#xD;
