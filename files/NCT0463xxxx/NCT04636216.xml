  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Behavioral parent training is an evidence-based treatment for ADHD. The intervention can be&#xD;
      implemented individually, or in groups. Currently, group-based parent training programs&#xD;
      require considerable coordination, including ascertainment of a large physical space, the&#xD;
      coordination of all families traveling to the same location at the same time, and the require&#xD;
      for the provision of childcare. Innovations in online connectivity and ease of implementation&#xD;
      of online support applications (e.g., Zoom) may reduce these barriers. However, it is&#xD;
      necessary to investigate the feasibility and promise of the online approach to ensure it&#xD;
      supports parents effectively.&#xD;

      This study will utilize a pre-post, open trial design as the primary aim is to investigate&#xD;
      feasibility. Approximately sixty parents will complete prepost ratings of parenting behaviors&#xD;
      and measures of child functioning. They will also complete post treatment measures of&#xD;
      satisfaction and open-ended questions about feasibility and suggestions for future iterations&#xD;
      of the approach. Process measures will include data collection related to attendance and&#xD;
      engagement in the activities. Risks include breach of confidentiality and a lack of&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention for the child's presenting problems. Benefits include the&#xD;
      parent receiving an effective intervention.&#xD;
