    <textblock>
      Interdisciplinary psychological interventions targeting survivorship are not only&#xD;
      understudied but face several implementation challenges. For this project, the study team is&#xD;
      proposing to analyze these data to report on preliminary pilot outcomes, as well as&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of the implementation of the Survivorship Wellness Group&#xD;
      Program, an interdisciplinary wellness and health-behavior change program for survivors of&#xD;
      cancer, who have completed treatment at University of California, San Francisco and are&#xD;
      currently without evidence of active disease.&#xD;
