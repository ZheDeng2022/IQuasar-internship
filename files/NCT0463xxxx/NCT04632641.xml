    <textblock>
      Primary objective: To compare the safety and efficacy of closure strategies post venous&#xD;
      access procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: We anticipate that the use of a venous closure device will decrease the time to&#xD;
      hemostasis (TTH), time to ambulation (TTA) and time to discharge (TTD) compared to&#xD;
      conventional methods of closure following venous access procedure.&#xD;

      This study will be a prospective, randomized study of patients who are undergoing one or more&#xD;
      of the following procedures at ASLMC:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Ablations, including any of the following: Ablation for AF atrial flutter,&#xD;
           supraventricular tachycardia (SVT), and/or Atrioventricular nodal/junctional (AVN/AVJ)&#xD;
           using the radiofrequency (RF) catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patent Foramen Ovale (PFO)/ASD closure&#xD;
&#xD;
      OR&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        5. MitraClip transcatheter mitral valve repair&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized into one of three venous closure groups or one of two venous&#xD;
      closure groups based on their sheath bore size after a clean stick has been achieved with no&#xD;
      complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small-bore (5F-13F) venous access group (1:1:1)&#xD;
