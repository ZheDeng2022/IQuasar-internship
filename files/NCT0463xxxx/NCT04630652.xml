  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the newly developed biologics (drugs derived from living cells cultured in a&#xD;
      laboratory) are highly effective in controlling psoriasis, all the biologics should be&#xD;
      continuously injected to suppress recurrence of the disease. In this regard, the observation&#xD;
      in the phase II clinical trial conducted by us (Laboratory for Investigative Dermatology at&#xD;
      the Rockefeller University) was groundbreaking that just a single dose of anti-IL-23p19&#xD;
      antibody (risankizumab, trade name: Skyrizi, study drug in this clinical trial)&#xD;
      administration produced disease clearance up to 66 weeks in 46% (6 of 13) of patients.&#xD;
      However, there is a lack of understanding about immune regulation in human skin induced by&#xD;
      anti-IL-23p19 antibody injection, and there is a need to conduct a psoriasis clinical trial&#xD;
      for single-cell sequencing immune cells in human psoriasis skin before and after&#xD;
      anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration, and to correlate regulatory immune cell alterations&#xD;
      with clinical disease progression. The overall objective of the clinical trial is to study&#xD;
      regulatory immune cell alterations induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in&#xD;
      psoriasis patients who achieve long-term disease clearance off drugs.&#xD;

      Although the newly developed biologics targeting IL-23/Th17 axis are highly effective in&#xD;
      controlling psoriasis, all the biologics should be continuously injected to suppress&#xD;
      recurrence of the disease. In this regard, the observation in our phase I psoriasis clinical&#xD;
      trial was groundbreaking that just a single dose of anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration&#xD;
      produced disease clearance up to 66 weeks in 46% (6 of 13) of patients. Since FoxP3 mRNA&#xD;
      levels remained high in posttreatment biopsy specimens of these patients, we hypothesized&#xD;
      that IL-23p19 inhibition increased regulatory T-cell levels or function in resolved psoriatic&#xD;
      skin. However, there is a lack of understanding about regulatory immune cell promotion by&#xD;
      IL-23p19 inhibition in human skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overall objectives of the study, are to (i) identify regulatory immune cell alterations&#xD;
      induced by anti-IL-23p19 antibody administration in the skin of patients whose psoriasis is&#xD;
      cleared without recurrence and (ii) develop pre-treatment predictive models for psoriasis&#xD;
      patients that anticipate disease clearance and recurrence after short-term anti-IL-23p19&#xD;
      antibody injection. The rationale for this project is that molecular evidence of immune&#xD;
      tolerance induction by IL-23p19 inhibition in human skin is likely to offer a strong clinical&#xD;
      framework whereby new strategies to prevent recurrence of chronic inflammatory diseases can&#xD;
      be developed. In this study, subjects with moderate-to-severe psoriasis will receive&#xD;
      FDA-approved anti-IL-23p19 antibody (Generic name: Risankizumab, Product name: SKYRIZIâ„¢ or&#xD;
      risankizumab-rzaa) up to 4 months following the FDA-approved indications, usage, dosage, and&#xD;
      administration in the FDA-approved dosage forms and strengths through week 16, after which,&#xD;
      dosing stops.&#xD;
