    <textblock>
      The Dilated Cardiomyopathy-Cardiac Magnetic Resonance (DCM-CMR) Study is an ancillary study&#xD;
      from the parent study, DCM Precision Medicine Study. The rationale for the DCM-CMR study is&#xD;
      to leverage cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to detect earliest findings of DCM in&#xD;
      the at-risk family members enrolled into the parent study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dilated cardiomyopathy of unknown cause (DCM) is a major public health problem affecting more&#xD;
      than a million people in the U.S. Most DCM is now known to have an underlying genetic basis.&#xD;
      First-degree relatives (FDRs) of an individual with DCM are considered to be genetically at&#xD;
      risk, particularly if they carry variants classified as pathogenic (P), likely pathogenic&#xD;
      (LP) or uncertain significance (VUS) in DCM genes. Practice guidelines recommend that these&#xD;
      FDRs undergo serial imaging because prompt intervention may avert advanced disease. While&#xD;
      tissue damage is already well underway when DCM is manifest, myocardial tissue changes,&#xD;
      termed &quot;pre-DCM&quot; herein, are known to precede adverse changes in myocardial structure and&#xD;
      function. The investigators central hypothesis states that cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR)&#xD;
      imaging may detect pre-DCM in individuals with increased genetic risk by identifying&#xD;
      myocardial tissue changes prior to myocardial structural and functional changes. CMR measures&#xD;
      of myocardial tissue characteristics, including late gadolinium enhancement and myocardial T1&#xD;
      mapping, have been histopathologically validated and have established diagnostic and&#xD;
      prognostic value in DCM. Thus, the investigators specific hypotheses state that adverse&#xD;
      CMR-based myocardial tissue characteristics will be associated with (1) A higher burden&#xD;
      (number) of relevant variants (P, LP, VUS) in established DCM genes; and (2) Subsequent&#xD;
      adverse changes in measures of cardiac structure and function. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      leverage the DCM Precision Medicine Study, a multisite DCM Consortium study now with 1230 DCM&#xD;
      patients (probands), balanced for race and sex, and their FDRs, most with no history of DCM.&#xD;
      FDRs are cascade tested for relevant variants (P, LP, VUS) in DCM genes identified in&#xD;
      probands. The investigators aim to (1) Estimate the associations between CMR-based myocardial&#xD;
      tissue characteristics and the number (burden) of the proband's variants in DCM genes in&#xD;
      at-risk FDRs. In 650 FDRs of probands with LP/P variants and/or VUSs, CMR scans will be&#xD;
      completed at 9 participating DCM Consortium sites. The association between CMR-based&#xD;
      myocardial tissue characteristics and the number of the proband's variants of each class&#xD;
      (LP/P, VUS) carried by an at-risk FDR in a particular age group will be evaluated, adjusting&#xD;
      for biologically relevant covariates. The investigators will also (2) Estimate the&#xD;
      association between CMR-based myocardial tissue characteristics and subsequent changes in&#xD;
      measures of cardiac structure and function in FDRs with normal baseline left-ventricular size&#xD;
      and function. FDRs examined in Aim 1 will receive a second CMR exam 2.5 years after their&#xD;
      baseline exam. The investigators will estimate the covariate-adjusted associations between&#xD;
      baseline myocardial tissue characteristics and subsequent changes in CMR-derived measures of&#xD;
      cardiac structure and function in groups defined by the most deleterious of the proband's&#xD;
      variants carried (none, VUS, or LP/P). This study will validate a CMR-derived &quot;pre-DCM&quot;&#xD;
      phenotype for FDRs who carry P or LP variants (established risk), and also provide&#xD;
      preliminary evidence that some VUSs are biologically relevant.&#xD;
