  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the additional linear ablation after pulmonary vein isolation (PVI) is a class IIB&#xD;
      indication for AF catheter ablation in patients with persistent AF, no clear benefit has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in the recent randomized clinical trials (STAR-AF2 or POBI trials).&#xD;
      Nevertheless, in the retrospective cohort data of this research team, additional POBI and AL&#xD;
      were helpful in persistent AF patients with left atrial (LA) size &gt; 50mm or more or low LA&#xD;
      voltage. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of additional POBI&#xD;
      and AL compared to CPVI alone in persistent AF patients with LA size over 50mm. Also, we&#xD;
      intend to proceed with this randomized clinical trial with the high power short duration&#xD;
      ablation protocol, which is effective in shortening the procedure time.&#xD;

      A. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Prospective randomization (pulmonary vein isolation [PVI] group vs. additional posterior&#xD;
           box isolation [POBI] group vs. additional POBI and anterior line [AL] group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Target number of subjects: 480 (160 per group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rhythm follow-up : 2012 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines (Holter monitoring at the baseline, 2&#xD;
           month, and thereafter every 6 months; ECG if the patient has any symptom)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Anticoagulant therapy followed by 2014 ACC/AHA/ESC guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. All complications in each group will be evaluated including the re-hospitalization rate,&#xD;
           major cardiovascular event, and mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Progress and rhythm/ECG follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To be performed in accordance with the 2012 ACC/AHA/HRS guidelines for AF management&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow-up at 1 weeks, 3 months, and thereafter every 6-month after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Rhythm control at 3 months, and thereafter every 6-month follow-up with Holter&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. If the patient complains of symptoms, ECG will be performed at any time, and rhythm&#xD;
           follow-up will be carried out with a Holter or event recorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Follow-up All the patients will be followed-up at 1, 3, 6 months, and thereafter every 6&#xD;
      months. If the patient shows any symptom within the clinical study period, patient will visit&#xD;
      the outpatient clinic. ECG will be performed at every outpatient visits, and 24-hour Holter&#xD;
      or event recording will be performed every 6 months for 2 years, and every year after 2 years&#xD;
      (2012 Heart Rhythm Society/EHRA/European Cardiac Arrhythmia Society Expert Consensus&#xD;
      Statement guidelines). If atrial fibrillation or atrial tachycardia lasting more than 30&#xD;
      seconds is observed in 12-lead ECG or Holter, it will be evaluated as recurrence. Recurrence&#xD;
      within 3 months after the procedure will be classified as early recurrence, and that after 3&#xD;
      months will be classified as clinical recurrence.&#xD;
