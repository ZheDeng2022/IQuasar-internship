  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control trial to compare gestational age-based dosing with&#xD;
      standard dosing of unfractionated heparin for thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized antepartum&#xD;
      patients. The investigators aim to determine the effect of dosing on receipt of neuraxial&#xD;
      anesthesia and pregnancy outcomes and evaluate the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin in pregnancy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Venous thromboembolism is one of the leading causes of maternal morbidity and mortality, and&#xD;
      antepartum hospitalizations place pregnant patients at an even higher risk of developing&#xD;
      thromboembolism. As a result, there is an increased emphasis on administering pharmacologic&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis for antepartum patients with prolonged hospitalizations. Previously,&#xD;
      standard dosing of unfractionated heparin was widely adopted for thromboprophylaxis in the&#xD;
      pregnant population. However, due to a suspected altered metabolism of unfractionated heparin&#xD;
      in pregnancy resulting in a decrease response, the American College of Obstetricians and&#xD;
      Gynecologists (ACOG) currently recommends considering gestational age-based dosing for&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin for thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy with standard dosing as an&#xD;
      alternative option. The data supporting altered dosing is very limited. In addition,&#xD;
      increased dosing of heparin may result in challenges in anesthetic management, potentially&#xD;
      limiting the receipt of neuraxial anesthesia resulting in increased need for general&#xD;
      anesthesia associated with both increased maternal and fetal risks. The potential effects of&#xD;
      higher prophylactic unfractionated heparin dosing in pregnant patients need to be further&#xD;
      explored before being widely adopted for inpatient antepartum thromboprophylaxis. The&#xD;
      investigators propose this study to provide a direct comparison of gestational age-based&#xD;
      unfractionated heparin dosing to standard dosing of unfractionated heparin for pharmacologic&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis of hospitalized antepartum patients.&#xD;
