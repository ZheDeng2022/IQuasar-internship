  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ARGONAUT is a longitudinal, prospective, observational study that will enroll up to 4,000&#xD;
      advanced-stage cancer patients of diverse racial backgrounds to collect data used to develop&#xD;
      precision microbiome medicines and for the identification of clinically actionable&#xD;
      cancer-specific biomarkers to guide therapeutic decisions. Four types of solid tumor cancers&#xD;
      will be profiled including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), triple negative breast cancer&#xD;
      (TNBC), colorectal cancer (CRC) and pancreatic cancer. Data collected from this study will be&#xD;
      used to develop the most effective new therapies, via microbiome optimization, all to the&#xD;
      benefit of patients and the physicians treating them. Stool and blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected longitudinally and analyzed to determine the impact of gut microbiome composition&#xD;
      and function on the immune system and efficacy of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet the entry criteria will provide 2 samples each of blood and stool over a&#xD;
      6-month period. Follow-up appointments will be held at 12, 18, and 24 months to collect tumor&#xD;
      scan results and any other updated medical data, with no samples collected.&#xD;
