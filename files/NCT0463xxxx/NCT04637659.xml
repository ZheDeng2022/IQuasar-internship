  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-treatment apical periodontitis is a fairly prevalent condition frequently caused by a&#xD;
      persistent endodontic infection due to failure of the endodontic treatment. Microbial species&#xD;
      in treated or untreated root canals were found to be different, with the former being less&#xD;
      diverse and mainly characterized by Gram positive, facultative anaerobes bacteria than the&#xD;
      latter. Enterococcus faecalis is the most frequently detected species in root-filled teeth in&#xD;
      many studies (Zhang et al., 2015). In fact, E. Faecalis retains many virulence factors&#xD;
      allowing adhesion to host cells and extracellular matrix, tissue invasion and damage through&#xD;
      toxins release, as well as the ability to survive even in harsh environmental conditions.&#xD;
      Further studies are needed to clarify E. faecalis prevalence among the different forms of&#xD;
      pulpal and periapical lesions as well as its correlation with clinical symptoms.&#xD;

    <description>Chemo-mechanical preparation will be performed using reciprocating instruments . Irrigation will be carried out with 5.25% NaOCl during instrumentation and a final flush of 17% EDTA followed by 5.25% NaOCl. After drying with paper points, canal obturation will be achieved through continuous condensation wave technique. Obturation with gutta-percha will be performed using Reciproc blue R25 master cones and root canal sealer using the BeeFill 2 in 1 device (VDW, GmbH) with a small heat carrier (#40 tip size and .03 taper) following the manufacturer's instructions. After the down-packing phase, the back-filling will be performed with the same device and manual compaction using endodontic pluggers.</description>
