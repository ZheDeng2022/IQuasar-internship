  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the influence that extravascular lung water index (EVLWi) could&#xD;
      have on the efficacy and persistance of efficacy of prone position in patients with acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prone position will increase blood oxygenation in 75% of the cases and will be persistant in&#xD;
      half of the cases. Unfortunately, no clinical criteria has been found correlated with&#xD;
      efficacy. The quantity of lung edema, with increased lung weight, could be a determinant&#xD;
      factor of efficacy and the persistance of the efficacy. EVLWi, assessed with the PiCCO2&#xD;
      device, reflects the quantity of fluid accumulated in interstitial and alveolar spaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that patients with higher EVLWi will have less efficacy of prone position&#xD;
      in oxygenation and also that the beneficial effects of prone position will last shorter&#xD;
      compared to patients with lower EVLWi.&#xD;
