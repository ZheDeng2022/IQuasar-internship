      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of different messages about depression&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants recruited through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) will complete a screening&#xD;
      questionnaire and provided the opportunity to consent to participate. Upon entry to the&#xD;
      study, eligible participants will complete several questionnaires pre- and&#xD;
      post-randomization. Randomization will be to view either a video detailing a type of&#xD;
      depression treatment (cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medication, or the&#xD;
      combination of both treatments) with and without an emphasis on personalization. A no video&#xD;
      condition is also included.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Regressed change from baseline in expectations on the Credibility/Expectancy Questionnaire (CEQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes to complete assessment. Assessed immediately pre- and post-intervention (on the same day)</time_frame>
    <description>The CEQ is a validated, commonly used measure assessing views of the credibility and expectations for benefit from a treatment.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Regressed change from baseline in prognostic pessimism on an adapted version of the Perceptions of Depression Scale (PDS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes to complete assessment. Assessed immediately pre- and post-intervention (on the same day)</time_frame>
    <description>Measured using an adapted version of the PDS, a validated scale measuring general prognostic pessimism. Minor changes to wording were made to directly address the three different interventions in the study (CBT, ADM, Combined Treatment).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Regressed change from baseline in affect on the Positive and Negative Affectivity Scale (PANAS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes to complete assessment. Assessed immediately pre- and post-intervention (on the same day)</time_frame>
    <description>The PANAS is a widely used measure for positive and negative affect, and has been shown to be valid and reliable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Regressed Change from baseline on the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes to complete assessment. Assessed immediately pre- and post-intervention (on the same day)</time_frame>
    <description>The BHS is the most widely used measure for hopelessness, and has been shown to be valid and reliable.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Regressed change from baseline in personal and perceived depression stigma on the Depression Stigma Scale (DSS).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes to complete assessment. Assessed immediately pre- and post-intervention (on the same day)</time_frame>
    <description>The DSS is a valid and reliable measure for assessing personal and perceived stigma related to depression. The scale contains two subscales: personal stigma and perceived stigma.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Regressed change from baseline in beliefs on the etiology of depression on the Reasons for Depression Questionnaire (RFD).</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes to complete assessment. Assessed immediately pre- and post-intervention (on the same day)</time_frame>
    <description>The RFD is a valid and reliable measure for assessing one's beliefs on the etiology of depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Willingness to take a next step.</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 90 minutes to complete assessment. Assessed at the end of the study questionnaires (same day)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants are given the option to learn more about finding cognitive behavioral therapy, antidepressant medications, or combination therapy. Based on their responses, they are provided links to relevant websites. This approach has been adopted from traditional marketing research to assess participants' responsiveness to a message.</description>
