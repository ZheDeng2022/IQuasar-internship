      Study to determine the proportion of travelers over the age of 60 years and travelers having&#xD;
      lived in a tropical country for more than 5 years with anti-HAV antibodies. This will be done&#xD;
      through a blood test. The investigators will then proceed with a short statistical analysis.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepatitis A is an infection which is found internationally but mainly in areas where hygiene&#xD;
      standards aren't high, as it is transmitted via the fecal-oral route. It is found mainly in&#xD;
      Asia, Africa and South America. In these areas, it is mainly children who are infected. The&#xD;
      seroprevalence rate reaches close to 100% at 5 years of age in some of these areas. To&#xD;
      prevent transmission, following the hygiene recommendations and getting vaccinated are&#xD;
      important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Switzerland, an average of 60 cases are recorded yearly. These cases are mainly brought in&#xD;
      from travelers in countries where hepatitis A is prevalent. Despite this, the prevalence of&#xD;
      hepatitis A in Switzerland has diminished over the years. A 1990 study done in Switzerland&#xD;
      that measured seroprevalence in different age groups, concluded that it was useful to do a&#xD;
      pre-immunisation test in travelers born before 1944 (age 46, now age 75, about a 50%&#xD;
      seroprevalence rate), had a history of jaundice or had a prolonged stay (&gt;1 year) in the&#xD;
      tropics, subtropics or in Southern Europe. The FOPH (Federal office of public health) has&#xD;
      therefore adjusted the vaccination plan to aligne with this conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the FOPH recommendations, the Expert Committee of Travel Medicine in Switzerland has&#xD;
      agreed upon that people who have lived in tropical countries (outside of Europe or North&#xD;
      America) for more than 5 years and people who are older than 65 years of age have already&#xD;
      developed an immunity against hepatitis A, either through a symptomatic or asymptomatic&#xD;
      infection in their infancy. Therefore, they are not vaccinated and their serology isn't&#xD;
      tested. The validity of this claim is questionable. Firstly, the level of hygiene has&#xD;
      improved in many countries including Switzerland since 1990 when the latest study was done.&#xD;
      Secondly, the seroprevalence rate has decreased from 1975 to 2014 in the European Economic&#xD;
      Area and European Union. Conversely, the proportion of susceptible people has increased.&#xD;
      Thirdly, there is very little circulation of the virus in Switzerland and that has been the&#xD;
      case since at least 1988 so there is less of a likelihood that people have gotten infected&#xD;
      with the virus. Lastly, In Asia, Latin America, Eastern Europe and the middle East the level&#xD;
      of endemicity has decreased over the years due to improved hygienic conditions. Consequently,&#xD;
      people that have lived in these countries for 5 years may not have been infected by the&#xD;
      virus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to determine the seroprevalence of anti-HAV in those two groups. The&#xD;
      two groups will be analysed separately. If the seroprevalence is &gt;90%, then no vaccination or&#xD;
      serology test should be taken. If it is between 50% and 90%, then a serology test should be&#xD;
      done first before potentially vaccinating. If it is below 50% then the traveler should be&#xD;
      vaccinated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a cross-sectional mono centric national observational study. The inclusion criteria&#xD;
      are people over 60 years old or travelers that have lived in a tropical country for at least&#xD;
      5 years who consult the travel clinic of Unisanté.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria are if the patient has not consented or is unable to, if they have&#xD;
      already been vaccinated against hepatitis A and if they have been injected with&#xD;
      immunoglobulines in the past 2 months (half-life of GamaStan: 23 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant that has agreed to take part in this project, serum will be drawn. The&#xD;
      serum will then be sent to the laboratoire de diagnostic of the CHUV. The results will then&#xD;
      be inserted in the patient's case report form. Once about 200 patients (100 for each group)&#xD;
      have been collected, a percentage of seroprevalence for each groupe will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected output:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this study, the investigators will have a better idea of the seroprevalence in the&#xD;
      two groups who are potentially at risk of being infected by Hepatitis A and who are not&#xD;
      receiving any preventative measures. The investigators expect that the seroprevalence rate in&#xD;
      the two groups will be lower than 90% and therefore the standard of care will need to be&#xD;
      changed.&#xD;
