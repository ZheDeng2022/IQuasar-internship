  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective, multi-institutional, noninferiority, randomized control trial&#xD;
      that will compare the efficacy of two antibiotic treatments in preventing SSI in patients&#xD;
      receiving immediate breast reconstruction with tissue expanders (TE-BR). The patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of the two treatment groups. One group will receive a single dose of&#xD;
      antibiotics just before surgery and if necessary, more doses during the surgery. The other&#xD;
      group will receive the same treatment as the first group, along with an additional week of&#xD;
      antibiotics after surgery. The study will assess the rates of SSI from the two groups. It&#xD;
      will also assess the type, duration and method (oral vs. intravenous) of subsequent&#xD;
      antibiotic use for patients who develop SSIs in each group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Among plastic surgeons, the clinical practice of prescribing postoperative prophylactic&#xD;
      antibiotics following postmastectomy breast reconstruction with tissue expanders ranges&#xD;
      widely from no postoperative antibiotics, to 5-7 days post-op, to antibiotics until the&#xD;
      drains are removed. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a single&#xD;
      preoperative antibiotic dose for clean and clean-contaminated procedures, even in the&#xD;
      presence of a drain. With the CDC creating a national action plan to reduce unnecessary&#xD;
      prophylactic antibiotics for clean non-contaminated cases by advocating use of only a single&#xD;
      pre-operative dose of antibiotics (see:&#xD;
      https://www.cdc.gov/drugresistance/pdf/national_action_plan_for_combating_antibotic-resistant&#xD;
      _bacteria.pdf ) there is mounting pressure on the plastic surgery community to adopt this&#xD;
      regimen of SSI prophylaxis. Because there are no definitive studies that provide sufficient&#xD;
      or conclusive evidence to affect antibiotic practice patterns among plastic surgeons on a&#xD;
      large-scale, plastic surgeons use a wide variety of protocols for their SSI prophylaxis,&#xD;
      especially in implant-based breast reconstruction. Plastic surgeons have generally not&#xD;
      adopted CDC guidelines because these recommendations were not based on studies in plastic&#xD;
      surgery patients, and the use of foreign body implants underneath devitalized soft tissue can&#xD;
      be associated with higher infection risks. Based on the literature and from self-reporting&#xD;
      from ASPS membership, there is a wide range of prophylactic antibiotic use to prevent SSI&#xD;
      from as little as one preoperative dose to many weeks of therapy; one week of post-operative&#xD;
      antibiotics is the most common form. However, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC)&#xD;
      recommends a single preoperative dose of antibiotics for clean cases, even in the presence of&#xD;
      a drain. Prolonged antibiotic courses can lead to antibiotic complications and development of&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitive studies to determine an optimal therapeutic strategy to prevent SSI in&#xD;
      implant-based plastic surgical procedures are lacking. This study will address a dilemma in&#xD;
      common plastic surgical operation: the use of post-operative antibiotics in prosthesis-based&#xD;
      breast reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central hypothesis for this multi-institutional, prospective randomized control trial&#xD;
      (RCT) is that a single pre-operative dose of intravenous antibiotics with intraoperative&#xD;
      redosing (SPD) is no worse (noninferiority design) at preventing SSI in tissue expander-based&#xD;
      breast reconstruction (TE-BR) than an additional week of post-operative antibiotic&#xD;
      prophylaxis (WPO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will evaluate the efficacy of single preoperative dose versus one-week antibiotic&#xD;
      regimens in preventing surgical site infection after tissue expander breast reconstruction.&#xD;
      The investigators will assess the rates of SSI from the SPD vs. the WPO groups. They will&#xD;
      assess the type, duration and method (oral vs. intravenous) of subsequent antibiotic use for&#xD;
      patients who develop SSIs in each group. The study will also compare the readmission and&#xD;
      premature expander removal rates due to SSI and the adverse antibiotic side effects in the&#xD;
      two groups.&#xD;
