      This study will implement an e-CBT program for OCD and observe its effects on brain&#xD;
      activation levels using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      brain activation levels in the basal ganglia and frontal cortex will decrease following&#xD;
      treatment. Individuals with OCD will be offered a 16-week e-CBT program with ERP mirroring&#xD;
      in-person CBT content that will be administered through a secure online platform. Efficacy of&#xD;
      treatment will be evaluated using clinically validated symptomology questionnaires at&#xD;
      baseline, week 8, week 16, and at a 6-month follow-up. Using fMRI at baseline and&#xD;
      post-treatment, brain activation levels will be assessed at resting state, and while exposed&#xD;
      to anxiety-inducing images (i.e., dirty dishes if cleanliness is an obsession). The effects&#xD;
      of treatment on brain activation levels and the correlation between symptom changes and&#xD;
      activation levels will be analyzed.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-randomized pilot study design will be employed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (fMRI) will be conducted at baseline and post-treatment to evaluate activation level changes&#xD;
      in the basal ganglia and frontal cortex. Clinically validated symptomology questionnaires&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate treatment efficacy. Additionally, qualitative interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted to gather personal demographic information as well as information regarding&#xD;
      participant experience while using the online psychotherapy clinic. This study has been&#xD;
      registered on the ClinicalTrials.Gov Protocol Registration and Results System (NCT04630197).&#xD;
      Additionally, ethics approval has been obtained from the Queen's University Health Sciences&#xD;
      and Affiliated Teaching Hospitals Research Ethics Board (HSREB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants (n = 10) will be recruited from family medicine and psychiatric clinics at&#xD;
      Queen's University and Kingston Health Sciences Centre sites (Hotel Dieu Hospital and&#xD;
      Kingston General Hospital) in Kingston, Ontario, Canada. Additionally, local and social media&#xD;
      advertisements will be utilized. Participants will be enrolled in the study based on&#xD;
      referrals from outpatient clinics, family doctors, as well as self-referrals. Those invited&#xD;
      and interested in participating will have the study protocol explained along with an&#xD;
      evaluation by a psychiatrist on the research team through a secured video appointment.&#xD;
      Participants will be evaluated for a diagnosis of OCD based on the Diagnostic and Statistical&#xD;
      Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Edition (DSM-5) [48]. Once a diagnosis of OCD is confirmed&#xD;
      and the participant is given written and verbal instructions on how to participate in the&#xD;
      online therapy, informed consent will be obtained. Inclusion criteria include the following:&#xD;
      between the ages of 18 and 65 years at the start of the study, a diagnosis of OCD according&#xD;
      to DSM-5, competence to consent to participate, ability to speak and read English, and&#xD;
      consistent and reliable access to the internet. Exclusion criteria include having any metal&#xD;
      implants or additional factors deemed not safe to undergo an MRI scan, active psychosis,&#xD;
      acute mania, severe alcohol or substance use disorder, and/or active suicidal or homicidal&#xD;
      ideation. Additionally, if a participant is receiving another form of psychotherapy, they&#xD;
      will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      e-CBT Protocol: Weekly sessions of e-CBT will be conducted through the Online Psychotherapy&#xD;
      Tool (OPTT), a secure, online, cloud-based mental health care delivery platform. These online&#xD;
      sessions will consist of approximately 30 slides and interactive therapist videos, with 16&#xD;
      modules in total (1 module per week). The content and format of these online sessions will&#xD;
      mirror in-person CBT for OCD. The connection between thoughts, behaviours, emotions, physical&#xD;
      reactions, and the environment will be a focus. Moreover, mindfulness, body scanning,&#xD;
      self-care, goal setting, thinking errors, the 5-part model, and thought records will be&#xD;
      employed as techniques for participants. ERP will be incorporated into the e-CBT program as&#xD;
      this is the first-line route of treatment. Slides will highlight different topics each week&#xD;
      and include general information, an overview of skills, and homework on that topic. The&#xD;
      homework included in each session will be submitted through OPTT and reviewed by therapists&#xD;
      with personalized feedback provided within 3 days of submission. Weekly homework submission&#xD;
      for feedback will be mandatory before being eligible for the next session. After each&#xD;
      completion of the e-CBT program, participants will be interviewed to investigate their&#xD;
      experience using OPTT and their perception of how the treatment went. Participants can access&#xD;
      their therapy sessions from any device with internet access (desktop computer, laptop,&#xD;
      cellphone, tablet) and can be run on a variety of internet browsers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fMRI Protocol: All imaging procedures will occur at the Queen's University MRI Facility in&#xD;
      Kingston, Ontario, Canada using a Siemens 3.0 Tesla whole-body MRI scanner with a standard&#xD;
      coil. Scans will occur at baseline (pre-treatment), after week 16 (post-treatment, and at a&#xD;
      6-month follow-up. During scanning, participants will lay on the scanning table on their&#xD;
      back, with their head resting on a foam pad to reduce movement. Appointments will be 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical reference images will be captured initially. Following this, fMRI scans will occur&#xD;
      while participants are shown neutral images and anxiety-inducing images (i.e., dirty dishes&#xD;
      if cleanliness is an anxiety-inducing concept for a specific participant). The frontal cortex&#xD;
      and basal ganglia will be the focuses of the imaging procedures as we are interested in the&#xD;
      activation level changes during neural anxiety processing. These images will be standardized&#xD;
      pictures from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS) that will be selected&#xD;
      specifically for each patient by members of our research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be shown a total of 40 images (20 neutral, 20 anxiety-inducing; R = 0.5)&#xD;
      during the fMRI scans. There will be 4 fMRI runs that occur in the following sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 neutral images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break, 5 anxiety-inducing&#xD;
           images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 new anxiety-inducing images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break, 5 new&#xD;
           neutral images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 new anxiety-inducing images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break, 5 new&#xD;
           neutral images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 neutral images (30s per image, 5s break between), 1-minute break, 5 anxiety-inducing&#xD;
           images (30s per image, 5s break between).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The images will be shown in sets (groups of 5) as opposed to intermingled as we hope this&#xD;
      will produce a more sustained emotional state and allow for more distinct readings. The&#xD;
      reasoning of the sets being repeated in the middle (back-to-back of the anxiety-inducing&#xD;
      images in the example above) is for participants to not become as accustomed to the ordering.&#xD;
      Moreover, we will change this ordering for every participant (i.e, The next participant would&#xD;
      receive back-to-back sets of the neutral imaging in runs 2 and 3). This is done to&#xD;
      counterbalance the imaging sets. Participants will be prompted to imagine themselves in the&#xD;
      situations described in the images. The images will appear on a screen and then be reflected&#xD;
      into the scanner for participants to view. 0.5% blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal&#xD;
      difference between conditions (p &lt; 10-6) will be considered a detectable change (eff =&#xD;
      0.005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anatomical reference images will be captured with the phase encoding direction collected&#xD;
      sagitaly from anterior to posterior. These images will be captured with T1-weighted&#xD;
      high-resolution magnetization prepared rapid acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) images with 1&#xD;
      x 1 x 1 mm3 isotropic voxels. For the stimuli-exposed image acquisitions, T2*-weighted&#xD;
      gradient-echo echo-planar imaging (GE-EPI) with 1.5 x 1.5 x 2 mm3 voxels will be used. A flip&#xD;
      angle of 90 degrees and a bandwidth of 1500 Hz will be used. The field of view will be 192 x&#xD;
      192 mm with a 64 x 64 mm matrix resolution. With this phase encoding, the spatial resolution&#xD;
      will be 3 mm, with an echo time (TE) of 25 ms, a repetition time (TR) of 2.5 s, and a&#xD;
      multi-slice imaging factor of 2 being employed. With these parameters, 170 volumes will be&#xD;
      captured. To un-distort images, the GE-EPI fMRI data will be mapped to a non-distorted set of&#xD;
      GE images from the same participant. Next, the non-distorted GE images will be mapped to the&#xD;
      T1-weighted MPRAGE image. Finally, the T1-weighted MPRAGE will be mapped to the Montreal&#xD;
      Neurological Institute (MNI) standardized brain template. In doing this, the GE-EPI fMRI data&#xD;
      will be mapped to the MNI template with maximum accuracy.&#xD;
