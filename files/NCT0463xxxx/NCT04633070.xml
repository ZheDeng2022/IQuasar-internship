    <textblock>
      Health behaviour applications (also referred to as &quot;apps&quot;) have the potential to provide&#xD;
      several advantages for motivating behaviour change for health and well-being. Finding ways to&#xD;
      increase and sustain health promoting behaviour changes has been a challenge during health&#xD;
      app development. Gamification, which is the use of game elements in a non-game situation,&#xD;
      shows promise and has proven effective in many fields. However, key questions remain&#xD;
      concerning how to use gamification in apps to modify health behaviour, especially to support&#xD;
      adherence to dietary pattern recommendations. To investigate and summarize the current&#xD;
      evidence, a systematic review of the totality of evidence from clinical trials and&#xD;
      observational studies will be conducted to capture and distinguish the types of gamification&#xD;
      strategies that may be most effective in improving and sustaining health promoting behaviours&#xD;
      to inform future health behaviour app development.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Studies on health behaviours such as physical activity and smoking cessation&#xD;
      (behaviour change) have indicated that gamification is an effective tool for engagement and&#xD;
      behaviour change, especially when multiple different competitive elements are used including:&#xD;
      a ranking system, badges and achievements, points, social media interaction, and leveling up.&#xD;
      Gamification is the use of game elements in a non-game environment to invoke behaviour&#xD;
      change. The majority of health-focused gamification investigations are currently conducted&#xD;
      using web or mobile-based delivery platforms in adults focusing on physical activity. Access&#xD;
      to these web and mobile based applications through smartphones, tablets and computers has&#xD;
      grown rapidly. In 2016, 94% of Canadians had home internet access, with 88% reporting that&#xD;
      they use a smartphone for personal use. Moreover, a recent survey in the US found that 73% of&#xD;
      those with, or at risk of cardiovascular disease, have a smartphone and 43% use a&#xD;
      health-related application to track progress towards a health goal. While research on&#xD;
      mobile-based app use for modifying diet is promising, the effectiveness of using gamification&#xD;
      in apps for sustaining dietary pattern adherence is unclear. An investigation and summary of&#xD;
      the current types of gamification strategies that may be most effective is important to&#xD;
      inform and aid future app development. The ultimate aim of this research investigation is to&#xD;
      inform the development of the PortfolioDiet.app, a dietary pattern adherence application for&#xD;
      reducing LDL-cholesterol in individuals at risk for cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To conduct a systematic review investigating the gamification strategies used in&#xD;
      applications for long term behaviour change, with a specific focus on dietary pattern&#xD;
      adherence in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: A systematic review of the literature will be conducted according to the Cochrane&#xD;
      Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions and reported according to the Preferred&#xD;
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data sources: MEDLINE, EMBASE, and The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials&#xD;
      (Clinical Trials; CENTRAL) will be searched using appropriate search terms supplemented by&#xD;
      hand searches of references of included studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study selection: The investigators will include prospective cohort studies and controlled&#xD;
      trials. Studies will be included if they are &gt;= 2-months in duration and assess the relation&#xD;
      of different gamification strategies used in health behaviour applications with adherence to&#xD;
      the health intervention, participant engagement with using the application, and/or the&#xD;
      intended health outcome. There will be no language restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data extraction: Two or more investigators will independently extract relevant data and&#xD;
      assess risk of bias using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. All disagreements will be resolved&#xD;
      by consensus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcome will be adherence to the intervention associated with use of&#xD;
      the application, such as, but not limited to: physical activity, smoking cessation,&#xD;
      increasing fruit and vegetable intake, improving healthy food index score. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include participant engagement with use of the application. This adherence to using the&#xD;
      application may be determined based on number of using days using the application compared to&#xD;
      intended number of days of application usage. Observation of a significant change in the&#xD;
      intended health outcome, such as, blood glucose, HbA1c, blood lipids, weight change [BMI,&#xD;
      body weight, waist circumference, will also be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Synthesis: A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet will be used to track the extractions and&#xD;
      summarize the qualitative and quantitative data from each study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of Bias (Quality) Assessment: The risk of bias of each included study will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. This will be done in&#xD;
      relation to evaluating the criteria for assessing risk as either low, high or uncertain risk&#xD;
      of bias as identified in the Risk of Bias tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge translation plan: The results will be disseminated through interactive&#xD;
      presentations at local, national and international scientific meetings and publication. As&#xD;
      well as utilized in a publically available web-based application hosted on the Canadian&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Society website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance: Gamification has been identified as a promising tool for health promotion.&#xD;
      While research directly comparing gamified interventions to non-gamified controls has found&#xD;
      beneficial effects on physical activity, or more recently mental health, there is a lack of&#xD;
      evidence on investigating gamification for dietary change. As poor health behaviours (i.e.&#xD;
      unhealthy diet, smoking, sedentary behaviour) have been repeatedly identified as major&#xD;
      contributors to disease burden in Canada and globally, interventions which can target and&#xD;
      improve these behaviours over a long term are required. Furthermore, as the generations who&#xD;
      have grown up with the internet and app technology begin to age they will seek engaging&#xD;
      digital tools to improve health outcomes, and therefore the need for digital health&#xD;
      interventions that are effective at improving and sustaining beneficial health behaviours&#xD;
      will only continue to grow.&#xD;
