  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      multiple 4SCAR-T cell therapy which targets GD2, PSMA and CD276 surface antigens in patients&#xD;
      with relapsed and refractory neuroblastoma (NB). Another goal of the study is to understand&#xD;
      the function of the multi-CAR-T cells and their persistency in the patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuroblastoma is one of the most aggressive childhood tumors arising from neural crest cells.&#xD;
      Nearly 50% of patients with high risk disease have poor long-term survival even after&#xD;
      multimodal treatments. Novel immunotherapy targeting tumor-specific antigens has been&#xD;
      developed to meet the desperate need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disialoganglioside (GD2) is a well-studied tumor associated antigen which is expressed&#xD;
      uniformly in NB but restrictedly in normal tissue. Over the past few years, CAR-T therapy&#xD;
      against GD2 in NB has achieved encouraging but modest outcomes. Only a fraction of patients&#xD;
      achieved measurable responses. Like for many other solid tumors, CAR-T therapy for NB is not&#xD;
      as effective as for hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators use &quot;multiple targeting&quot; approach as the strategy to&#xD;
      overcome the challenge in treating NB. Prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) is expressed&#xD;
      in normal prostate but is upregulated in prostate tumor. However, PSMA expression is not&#xD;
      restricted to prostate cancer. By immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining, the investigators&#xD;
      confirmed that PSMA is expressed in a variety of solid tumors, including brain tumor,&#xD;
      neuroblastoma and some lymphoma tumor tissues. Therefore, PSMA could potentially serve as a&#xD;
      promising target for antigen-specific immunotherapy in patients with NB. In addition, CD276&#xD;
      (B7-H3) is an immune checkpoint molecule highly expressed on many solid tumors including NB.&#xD;
      CD276 has been characterized to be involved in tumor evasion and thus its expression is&#xD;
      correlated with poor prognosis. These characteristics make CD276 an attractive candidate for&#xD;
      immunotherapy. Given the significant variation of tumor antigen expression among patients,&#xD;
      the investigators aim to examine GD2, PSMA and CD276 expression in each patient's tumor&#xD;
      sections by IHC staining, and combine two or three highly-expressed targets for the 4SCAR-T&#xD;
      therapy. This individualized and multi-antigen-targeted approach is a new strategy to&#xD;
      overcome the limited clinical outcome in the 4SCAR-T therapy against NB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical study is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of the&#xD;
      combinational GD2, PSMA and CD276 4SCAR-T cell therapy against NB. Another goal of the study&#xD;
      is to learn more about the function of the multi-4SCAR-T cells and their persistency in the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
