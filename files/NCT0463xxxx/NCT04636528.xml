  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomised, controlled study, with two parallel groups,&#xD;
      designed to assess the clinical impact of a digital exercise program against conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation for shoulder tendonitis. The hypothesis is that all the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      measured will significantly improve after the program, and patients using this novel system&#xD;
      will attain at least the same outcomes than the ones attained by the conventional PT group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Shoulder pain is highly prevalent, being the third main complaint in primary care&#xD;
      settings.There is a wide range of reported incidence and prevalence rates, with a median of&#xD;
      24.8% of adults reporting shoulder pain every month. In developed countries, 1% of adults&#xD;
      annually consult a primary care provider due to shoulder pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Around 65 to 70% of shoulder pain complaints involve problems in the rotator cuff (RTC)&#xD;
      tendons, with incidence rising higher after the 4th decade of life.Abundant data from across&#xD;
      the world is available on the prevalence of RTC pathologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RTC dysfunction represent a huge burden for healthcare systems, insurance companies and&#xD;
      employers alike. Shoulder problems account for 2.4% of all general practitioner consultations&#xD;
      in the UK, and 4.5 million visits to physicians annually in the USA. One study in the UK20&#xD;
      estimated that nearly £310 million is spent on medical appointments in the first 6 months of&#xD;
      shoulder pain onset, and additional costs of surgical procedures are estimated at&#xD;
      approximately £30 million/year, with up to 50% of these costs related to sick leave from paid&#xD;
      employment. More than 300,000 surgical repairs for RTC pathologies are performed annually in&#xD;
      the USA, and the annual financial burden of RTC management was also estimated at $3 billion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A myriad of international clinical practice guidelines have been put forth over the years,&#xD;
      outlining the management of pain-causing shoulder disorders. Most causes of mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      and gradual onset shoulder pain are treated initially with conservative care. Indeed, many&#xD;
      recent studies and systematic reviews, as well as the American Academy of Orthopaedic&#xD;
      Surgeons guidelines, support that firstly the patient should be directed to a physical&#xD;
      therapy (PT) program and not surgery. For some specific conditions (e.g., symptomatic small&#xD;
      to medium full-thickness RTC tears), strong evidence further supports that both PT and&#xD;
      operative treatment attain significant improvements in patient-reported outcomes. Of note,&#xD;
      another systematic review on treatment options for shoulder pain suggests that passive&#xD;
      modalities, such as manual therapy, electrotherapy and taping should be avoided as&#xD;
      mono-therapy but that they could, in specific cases, provide additional benefit when utilized&#xD;
      in conjunction with therapeutic exercise programs. This suggests that the exercise component&#xD;
      of PT is fundamental in the treatment of painful shoulder disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding rehabilitation setting, some studies show that home-based therapy, based on&#xD;
      exercise, could be as effective as conventional PT interventions. This is in line with the&#xD;
      recent trends in healthcare delivery, moving away from inpatient care and towards home-based&#xD;
      care with the intent of improving cost-effectiveness. Furthermore, the need for home-based&#xD;
      digital solutions is now felt more acutely than ever, in the face of the current pandemic. In&#xD;
      this context, solutions enabling home-based rehabilitation without requiring real-time human&#xD;
      supervision can be key to improving effectiveness and lowering costs, while keeping all&#xD;
      stakeholders safe. Indeed, there are studies demonstrating the potential and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of shoulder postoperative care and rehabilitation through telehealth&#xD;
      solutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, while evidence is growing that digital therapeutics (DTx) can improve outcomes,&#xD;
      personalize care and decrease costs, there is still much ground to be explored in the field&#xD;
      of digital therapy following RCR. Several studies can be found on the validation/development&#xD;
      of systems/algorithms for monitoring shoulder motion to assist clinicians on patient&#xD;
      evaluation but these do not meet the aforementioned needs and cannot be considered digital&#xD;
      therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There have been some advances on new technologies for shoulder rehabilitation, namely using&#xD;
      wearable sensors and augmented reality. Of note, some of these studies focus on systems based&#xD;
      on inertial motion trackers that can be used by the patient at home, under remote monitoring&#xD;
      from the physical therapist. However, these are either in very preliminary stages of&#xD;
      development or validation, with no clinical validation studies performed, or are directed at&#xD;
      rehabilitation after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWORD Health has developed a novel motion tracking-based digital biofeedback system for&#xD;
      home-based physical rehabilitation - SWORD Phoenix - which is an FDA-listed class II medical&#xD;
      device. The company has previously conducted two pilot studies (NCT03047252; NCT03045549)&#xD;
      comparing a digital therapy program using this device against conventional face-to-face&#xD;
      physical therapy. These studies have proven the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of this&#xD;
      digital therapeutic on rehabilitation after total knee and hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, prospective, randomised, controlled study, with two parallel groups,&#xD;
      designed to assess the clinical impact of a digital exercise program against conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation for shoulder tendonitis. The hypothesis is that all the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      measured will significantly improve after the program, and patients using this novel system&#xD;
      will attain at least the same outcomes than the ones attained by the conventional PT group.&#xD;
