      study the effect of behavioral therapy and interferential current on management of bladder&#xD;
      dysfunction in patients with multiple sclerosis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fifty patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) (secondary progressive type SPMS) suffering from&#xD;
      bladder dysfunction were divided equally into two groups randomly; Group A received&#xD;
      biofeedback training (behavioral therapy) while group B received interferential training.&#xD;
      Both groups were assessed by urodynamics for detrusor pressure and maximum flow rate before&#xD;
      and after eight weeks of behavioral therapy and interferential training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis was managed using SPSS for windows, version 22 (SPSS, Inc., Chicago, IL). The&#xD;
      current test involved two independent variables. The first one was the (tested group);&#xD;
      between subject factors which had two levels (group A received behavioral therapy and group B&#xD;
      who received IF ) .The second one was the (measuring periods); within subject factor which&#xD;
      had two levels (pre, post). In addition, this test involved two tested dependent variables&#xD;
      (detrusor pressure and maximum flow rate ) .T independent and dependent tests were used to&#xD;
      compare between and within groups respectively. Data was considered statistically significant&#xD;
      when P &lt; .05&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All the patients were referred by a neurologist and the diagnosis was confirmed by the&#xD;
             Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI).The duration of being diagnosed as SPMS for both groups&#xD;
             were between one to two years. All the selected patients had normal mental examination&#xD;
             according to mini mental scale .Also, all the selected patients were medically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any other neurological deficits or orthopedics abnormalities or with&#xD;
             auditory dysfunction were excluded from this study. Patients with history of bladder&#xD;
             dysfunctions before the diagnosis of MS or attaining any attack during the treatment&#xD;
             period were also excluded.&#xD;
