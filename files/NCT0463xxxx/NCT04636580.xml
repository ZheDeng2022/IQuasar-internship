      Background: To evaluate the effect of the anxiety of a parent accompanying a child on the&#xD;
      child's anxiety during treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Parents of 160 patients (4-8 years old) were divided into two groups anxious and&#xD;
      non-anxious. Each groups had separated two randomized subgroups that with/without parents&#xD;
      accompanied their children. At the first visit, participating children were examined while&#xD;
      the behavior of the child during the examination was evaluated by a single pediatric dentist&#xD;
      according to their heart rates measured by a portable pulse oximeter and the data were&#xD;
      recorded (objective data).Forty-two children with a score of 1 and 4 on the Frankel Scale&#xD;
      were excluded. After the parents were divided into two groups, anxious and non-anxious, the&#xD;
      groups were equally divided randomly and the parents accompanied their children during the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recalled after one week for the treatment visit. Both groups were evaluated&#xD;
      using the basic behavior technique. Compomer fillings were performed on children with&#xD;
      infiltration anesthesia. The children's heart rates were measured by a portable pulse&#xD;
      oximeter during treatment. Finally, the children were asked to express how they felt about&#xD;
      the treatment by pointing out one of the faces on the Wong-Baker Faces Scale (subjective&#xD;
      data). The children also rated the experience on the Frankel scale administered by the same&#xD;
      operator.&#xD;
