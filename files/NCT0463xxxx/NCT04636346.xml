  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cancer Center Psychosocial services (Psycho-Oncology) offers group psychoeducational and&#xD;
      behavioral programs as part of its clinical service for cancer patients and services at the&#xD;
      Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center. Clinical outcomes and&#xD;
      acceptability/feasibility and implementation process data from these programs are routinely&#xD;
      gathered in an effort to engage in continuous quality improvement for the department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this project, the study team is proposing to retrospectively analyze a de-identified data&#xD;
      set of these data to report on pilot data on preliminary outcomes, acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility of the implementation of the COMPASS: Acting Mindfully for a Valued Life, based&#xD;
      upon Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, an evidence-based behavioral intervention and&#xD;
      facilitated by a licensed clinical psychologist in our department. This intervention was&#xD;
      implemented as a series of clinical offerings for seven 7-session groups between September&#xD;
      2015 and October 2018 for 113 individual cancer patients and survivors. Outcomes measured&#xD;
      include anxiety, depression, fear of recurrence, psychological flexibility, mindfulness;&#xD;
      values based living, and quality of life. Participants completed surveys at 4 time points,&#xD;
      pre and post, and two followup time points. Measures of demographics, satisfaction and&#xD;
      feasibility/acceptability were also collected. Insights gathered from this study will be used&#xD;
      to inform articles, grant applications and conference presentations on the implementation of&#xD;
      behavioral interventions for cancer patients and survivors.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Anxiety Short Form scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Anxiety Short form consists of 2 items addressing patient anxiety with item response scores ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (Always). Raw scores are converted to scaled T-scores with higher scores indicating a greater level of anxiety. Significant changes over time and trends in patient reported outcomes will be analyzed via student's T-test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Patient Reported Outcome Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Depression Short Form scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Depression Short form consists of 4 items addressing patient depression with item response scores ranging from 1 (never) to 5 (Always). Raw scores are converted to scaled T-scores with higher scores indicating a greater level of depression. Significant changes over time and trends in patient reported outcomes will be analyzed via student's T-test.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Acceptance and Action Questionnaire II (AAQ-II) scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The AAQ-II is a 7 item questionnaire used to track how participants are doing with applying psychological flexibility skills in their daily life. Item scores range from 1 (&quot;never true&quot;) to 7 (&quot;always true&quot;:), and total scores are computed by adding up responses for each question. Higher total scores mean less flexibility, while lower total scores mean more flexibility.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy scale (FACT-G) scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-G is a 27-item questionnaire designed to measure four domains of health related quality of life (HRQOL) in cancer patients with 4 domains of interest: Physical, social, emotional, and functional well-being. Each tem response score ranges from 0 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The total score is a sum of the subscale scores, with a range from 0 - 108. The higher the score, the better the HRQOL.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Valuing Questionnaire (VQ) scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The VQ is a 10-item scale designed to measure how consistently an individual has been living with their self-determined values and is helpful when administered during a course of Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT). Two subscale scores are measured: Progress and Obstruction. Progress items (Range = 0 to 30) are defined as enactment and perseverance in living consistently with one's values. Higher scores represent a closer alignment between one's internal values and one's actions. Obstruction (Range = 0 to 30) represents the extent to which various disruptions &quot;got in the way&quot; of valued living. Higher scores represent more interference with living consistently with one's values. Total scores are calculated by summing the raw scores and calculating percentile ranks. When used as a monitoring tool during a course of ACT, successful treatment is indicated by increasing Progress Scores and decreasing Obstruction Scores.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in The Fear of Cancer Recurrence Index (FCRI) severity subscale scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The nine-item FCRI evaluates the presence and severity of intrusive thoughts associated with FCR. Each item is rated on a Likert scale ranging from 0 (&quot;not at all&quot; or &quot;never&quot;) to 4 (&quot;a great deal' or &quot;all the time&quot;). A higher score indicates higher levels of FCR.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in the Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy - Spiritual Well-Being (FACIT-SP-12) scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The FACIT-SP-12 is a 12 item questionnaire which measures a participants spiritual well-being for the past 7 days. Item responses range from 0 (not at all) to 4 (very much). The sum of the item scores are used to calculate a total FACIT-SP-12 score ranging from 0 to 48. The higher the score, the better the QOL/spiritual well-being.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The FFMQ is a 39-item questionnaire that measures five factors which represent elements of mindfulness. The five facets are Observing, Describing, Acting with awareness, Non-judging of inner experience, and Non-reactivity to inner experience. Item scores range from 1 (&quot;never or very rarely true&quot;) to 5 (&quot;very often or always true&quot;:), and total scores are computed by adding up responses for the questions that fall into each facet, for a range of 8-40 per facet with the exception of the Non-react scores which range from 7-35. Higher scores on the Observe, React, and Non-react facets indicate higher levels of mindfulness and higher scores on the Act with Awareness and Non-judge items indicate less mindfulness.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in Happiness Index Profile (HI/P10) scores over time</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The HI/P10 is a 10-item questionnaire assessing positive affect, intention, and resiliency. Each item is scored from 0 (strongly disagree) to 10 (strongly agree). HI/P10 scores are calculated by adding the scores for each item to generate a total score out of 100.</description>

        The population studied will include the participants of the COMPASS Program offered by the&#xD;
        Cancer Center Psychosocial services (Psycho-Oncology) that consented to having their&#xD;
        responses for the surveys to be used for research purposes. The participants of COMPASS&#xD;
        were adult cancer patients across different cancer types. Participants that had previously&#xD;
        consented to having their responses to the surveys kept for research purposes will have&#xD;
        their responses accessed and kept as a part of a de-identified data set. No direct subject&#xD;
        contact will be included&#xD;
