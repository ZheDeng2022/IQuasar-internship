      These unparalleled size, nature and complexity of youth mental health problems would leave a&#xD;
      huge gap to fill after the Millennium, which would need stratified and timely interventions&#xD;
      to improve the mental well-being and metal health of the youth in the general population. The&#xD;
      use of music has been explored in improving the mental well-being and mental health in the&#xD;
      young people. The progressively digitalized lifestyle of the youth as the digital natives is&#xD;
      paralleled by frequent use of online music in their daily activities. This means that online&#xD;
      music interventions can be a new, youth-friendly and accessible means to deliver&#xD;
      interventions to the youth to improve their mental well-being and mental health. Therefore,&#xD;
      it is worthwhile to further explore the potential as well as underlying mechanisms of online&#xD;
      music in improving youth mental well-being and mental health in the community among young&#xD;
      people as a population lifestyle strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators would conduct a Randomized Control Study on Brief Online&#xD;
      Music Intervention (BOMI) by listening to a selected, guided and self-chosen online song each&#xD;
      day actively in a personalized and focused way in improving the mental well-being of young&#xD;
      people in the community. In the end, the possible design and promotion of specific, guided&#xD;
      and evidence-based self-help brief online music intervention by listening to music daily as a&#xD;
      lifestyle change can be an economic, convenient and evidenced-based mental well-being&#xD;
      intervention strategy among the youth at a population level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To study the effects of listening to an expert-selected, theory-guided and self-chosen&#xD;
      online song each day actively in a personalized and focused way (Brief Online Music&#xD;
      Intervention: BOMI) in improving mental well-being among young people in the community in&#xD;
      Hong Kong Hypothesis: Listening to an expert-selected, theory-guided and self-chosen song&#xD;
      each day actively in a personalized and focused way (Brief Online Music Intervention: BOMI)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Introduction 75% of all mental disorders has onset before the age of 24, with pronounced&#xD;
      effects extending throughout the lifespan. In recent years, studies showed that young people&#xD;
      suffer from an overall poor mental well-being. A recent online community study in Hong Kong&#xD;
      by the Department of Psychiatry of the University of Hong Kong shows that traumatic events,&#xD;
      post-traumatic stress disorder and depressive symptom levels are significantly higher in&#xD;
      young people under the age of 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These unparalleled size, nature and complexity of youth mental health problems would leave a&#xD;
      huge gap to fill after the Millennium, which would need stratified and timely interventions&#xD;
      to improve the mental well-being and mental health of young people in the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a fundamental component of youth culture in contemporary times, popular culture has&#xD;
      intrinsic, spontaneous and interactive relationships with young people, who are at a&#xD;
      developmental stage actively undergoing self-formation and socialization. Their relationships&#xD;
      can vary widely, ranging from formation of styles and trends, self-regulation, emotion&#xD;
      regulation, ideologies and attitudes, grouping and socializing, identification and even deep&#xD;
      down to identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among different forms of popular culture, music was said to be the most favoured leisure&#xD;
      activity among adolescents. The use of music in engaging young people would be understandably&#xD;
      considered to be direct, easy and effective, which should be a prerequisite for offering&#xD;
      further help and interventions to improve the mental well-being and mental health of young&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When it comes to the mental well-being and mental health of young people, the importance of&#xD;
      music has been shown in prevention of mental health problems in young people as well as in&#xD;
      facilitating those vulnerable young people receiving professional therapeutic supports. In&#xD;
      addition, music has the potential to assist in achieving their optimal functioning and&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the pathway between culture and mind, progressive attempts have been made to&#xD;
      explore the fundamental relationship between music, emotion and the brain. The evidence has&#xD;
      been reviewed as a unified theory of musical emotions, ranging from 'everyday emotions' to&#xD;
      'aesthetic emotions', from a neuro-scientific approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To look back in the humankind history, music has been used for healing for millenniums,&#xD;
      evolving in different forms and contents throughout generations. Last century, the emergence&#xD;
      of popular music and popular songs was actually a reflection of the changing contemporary&#xD;
      culture, economic conditions and ideologies. Across the millennium, the subsequent drastic&#xD;
      digitalization in our world and daily living results in progressively digitalized lifestyle&#xD;
      and habit of young people as the digital natives. In a recent global music report, 83% of&#xD;
      people at the age of 16 to 24 have audio streaming engagement. This means that online music&#xD;
      interventions can be a new, youth-friendly and accessible means to deliver interventions to&#xD;
      young people to improve their mental well-being and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is worthwhile to further explore the potential as well as underlying mechanisms&#xD;
      of online music in improving youth mental well-being and mental health in the community among&#xD;
      young people as a population lifestyle strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, regarding to the exploration for such positive potential, despite that there is&#xD;
      abundant evidence that young people can use music to improve mood daily, there is also&#xD;
      evidence that inappropriate use of music for young people with psychological distress can&#xD;
      cause negative effects on mental health. On the other hand, a study concluded that 'music is&#xD;
      not causing problems, but rather reflecting and interacting with the young person's state of&#xD;
      mental health'. In addition, it is more likely for young people to turn to media when they&#xD;
      are in a negative mood. The lack of self-awareness may even play into music listening choices&#xD;
      in young people in depression. Thus, it appears that there is a need to develop nuanced&#xD;
      strategies for increasing awareness of the effect that music listening can have on young&#xD;
      people's mood and well-being. In this regard, guidance based on theorizations and expert&#xD;
      opinions would be a necessary part in designing any music interventions for young people in&#xD;
      improving their mental well-being and mental health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of conceptualization and theorization, it is necessary to further delineate the&#xD;
      possible factors and underlying mechanisms involved, through postulated interactions with&#xD;
      rumination/reflection, resilience and self-esteem, in order to further provide evidence for&#xD;
      specific music-based interventions in improving the well-being and mental health for young&#xD;
      people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the end, the possible design and promotion of specific, guided and evidence-based&#xD;
      self-help brief online music intervention by listening to music daily as a lifestyle change&#xD;
      can be an economic, convenient and evidenced-based mental well-being intervention strategy&#xD;
      among young people at a population level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About ways of implementation, there is growing interest in studying automated music&#xD;
      categorization for delivering the specific recommendations to music listeners, like by&#xD;
      delineating a personalized music recommendation system based on electro-encephalography&#xD;
      feedback. That means that people might be able to design recommendation algorithms with&#xD;
      digital delivery tools in digital platforms based on evidence and guidance to deliver the&#xD;
      desirable brief online music intervention conveniently in the population in future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To go beyond, it is hoped that based on the findings, the investigators can further advocate&#xD;
      evidence-based use of stratified online music interventions to improve the mental well-being&#xD;
      and mental health in other aspects, like in clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The study is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) on Brief Online Music Intervention&#xD;
      (BOMI) in improving the mental well-being of young people in the community by comparing&#xD;
      participants receiving Brief Online Music Intervention (BOMI) daily for 3 months (BOMI Group)&#xD;
      with participants receiving psychoeducational online message (POM) (for focused reading for 5&#xD;
      minutes) daily for 3 months (POM Group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The study is a parallel 3-months RCT of music-based intervention with 150&#xD;
      subjects to be randomized into the intervention group (BOMI Group) and 150 subjects to the&#xD;
      control group (POM Group) as calculated below, with assessment at baseline and 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation The sample size was estimated using G*Power 3.1. Based on a previous&#xD;
      meta-analysis on music-based intervention which reported a 0.545 effect size (16), the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate our brief intervention will result in a smaller effect at 70% (i.e.&#xD;
      0.382). With 80% power and an alpha level of 5%, a sample size of 172 is required to detect&#xD;
      the group difference. The target sample size is then inflated to 215 to allow for a 20%&#xD;
      attrition rate, with 108 subjects on each arm. Based on this estimation, to increase the&#xD;
      power further, the investigators have an estimation of 150 participants on each arm expected&#xD;
      to be realistic to achieve in our study, with 20% loss to follow-up, leading to an available&#xD;
      sample size of 120 on each arm and a total of 240 available subjects in the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Randomization would be carried out using a computer-generated sequence with a&#xD;
      block size of 4 by an independent statistician. The statistician would advise the research&#xD;
      assistant of allocations via encrypted e-mail; the research assistant then would notify&#xD;
      participants by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics Application to IRB would be made to the University of Hong Kong. Informed consent&#xD;
      would be obtained and witnessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protection against bias Participants are not blinded to the treatment allocation, as the&#xD;
      intervention types are obvious. The research assistant enters data from the measures into&#xD;
      computer. Once completed, an independent statistician would analyze the data; these would not&#xD;
      be inspected until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. BOMI Group (Intervention Group) Development of the BOMI by an Expert Panel Firstly, the&#xD;
           investigators would invite a group of psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, social&#xD;
           workers, researchers, music therapists, music experts and musicians together with young&#xD;
           people to form an expert panel to discuss about and formulate the guiding principles and&#xD;
           therapeutic elements for subsequent respective song selections based on&#xD;
           interdisciplinary consensus and conceptualisation frameworks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The guiding principles would be based on the identified four dimensions in linking music&#xD;
           to well-being, namely relationship building, modifying emotions, modifying cognitions,&#xD;
           emotional immersion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           About the conceptualisation of the pathway of music in improving mental well-being, the&#xD;
           postulated therapeutic elements would include engagement in structured and groovy music,&#xD;
           ventilation with expressive music, distraction and relaxation with easy-listening music,&#xD;
           sense of pleasurability with aesthetic music, narration in songs with sense of mastery&#xD;
           and self worth through singing along, enhancement of interpersonal relationship with&#xD;
           music sharing, as well as free improvisation with free association.&#xD;
&#xD;
           About the postulated mechanisms of music in improving mental well-being, it would&#xD;
           include changes in rumination/reflection, resilience and self-esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Their relationships with the expected outcome are tabulated in Figure 1 as attached.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The expert panel members would also incorporate own individual taste, experience and&#xD;
           expertise in selection of the songs, which would be even more appealing to young people.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Based on these theorisations and postulations, the expert panel would choose songs to&#xD;
           form a 'Me Mind Well' (MMW) Online Song Playlist on online streaming music platform&#xD;
           specifically for young people in improving their mental well-being. The expert panel&#xD;
           would also devise guiding tips for young people in choosing their own song appropriately&#xD;
           by preventing possible negative effects and increasing their self-awareness, based on&#xD;
           existing and further theorizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eventually, the Intervention Group (BOMI Group) subjects would choose a song each day&#xD;
           according to the guidance, their mental state and preference to enter a five-minutes&#xD;
           daily personalized and focused music space. Instruction would be given to the subjects&#xD;
           to listen to their selected songs out of the MMW Online Song Playlist actively with full&#xD;
           attention during the whole period.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In view of the nature of the experience, there can be elements of mindfulness (i.e.&#xD;
           awareness that arises through paying attention, on purpose, in the present moment,&#xD;
           non-judgementally) in the intervention. In addition, a literature systemic review&#xD;
           concluded that it seems that music listening can induce mindfulness states, with&#xD;
           consequential benefits, e.g. improved attention or improved peak response intensity,&#xD;
           which could also lead to improvement in mental well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. POM Group (Control group) Control Group (POM Group) subjects would receive&#xD;
           psychoeducational online message (POM) (for focused reading for 5 minutes) daily for 3&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In essence, Intervention Group (BOMI Group) subjects would receive Brief Online Music&#xD;
      Intervention (BOMI) daily for 3 months, while Control Group (POM Group) subjects would&#xD;
      receive psychoeducational online message (POM) (for focused reading for 5 minutes) daily for&#xD;
      3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily reminders would be sent by phone messages for the assigned tasks. They are requested to&#xD;
      mark their finished tasks in calendar in digital form, which would be reviewed regularly by&#xD;
      research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment The assessments on music and pattern would be assessed at baseline and 3 months by&#xD;
      a self-report questionnaire developed by the research team named Music Habit Questionnaire&#xD;
      (MHQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following assessments would be done at baseline and 3 months after completion of&#xD;
      intervention by research assistants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome and measurement The primary outcome is mental well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement Tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental Well-Being: WHO 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome and measurement Secondary outcomes include mental distress, mental health,&#xD;
      musical engagement, mindfulness, QoL, rumination tendency, resilience and self-esteem&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement Tools:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mental Distress: K6 Mental Health: Depression Anxiety Stress Scales (DASS) Musical&#xD;
      Engagement: Healthy-Unhealthy Music Scale (HUMS) Mindfulness: Mindful Attention Awareness&#xD;
      Scale QoL: 12-Item Short Form Survey (SF-12) (Mental Component score) Rumination:&#xD;
      Rumination-Reflection Questionnaire (RRQ) Resilience: Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale&#xD;
      (CD-RISC) Self-esteem: Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale (SES)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative Study Qualitative research in the Intervention Group (BOMI Group) about their&#xD;
      experiences in engaging in a brief, regular, active, personalized and focused music space as&#xD;
      a lifestyle habit by focus group interview with ethnographic approach would be conducted to&#xD;
      analyze the subjective feelings and experiences, appreciation, cognitive appraisals,&#xD;
      behavioural changes, emotional feelings, mindfulness, rumination, reflection, resilience,&#xD;
      self-esteem, sociability and sense of mastery and pleasurability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data processing and analysis Primary Analysis The investigators would calculate Chi-square&#xD;
      with 95% confidence intervals for dichotomous outcomes, and Paired t-test with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals for changes in continuous outcomes. Repeat measure ANCOVA would also be used and&#xD;
      appropriate statistical tests would be used for confounder adjustments. In particular,&#xD;
      adjustment for mindfulness would also be performed to look into the possible confounding&#xD;
      effect of mindfulness in mental well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests would be two-tailed. After obtaining these results, the investigators would also&#xD;
      calculate the standardised mean difference (Cohen's d) to facilitate interpretation of&#xD;
      significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All analyses would be intention-to-treat. As a sensitivity analysis for the primary outcome,&#xD;
      the investigators assume no change for those where the outcome is unobserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary analysis The factors and underlying mechanisms involved, like postulated&#xD;
      interactions between rumination, resilience and self-esteem along the pathway from music&#xD;
      interventions to outcomes, are analyzed in the in the Intervention Group (BOMI Group) in&#xD;
      order to further delineate evidence-based theories for the specific music-based interventions&#xD;
      for young people. Multiple mediation analysis would be used.&#xD;
