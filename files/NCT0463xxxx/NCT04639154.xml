  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chest wall pain is a severe and distressing symptom. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is&#xD;
      an interfascial plane block where local anesthetic is injected between the erector spine&#xD;
      muscle and the transverse process. It is a simple procedure, with easy sonographic landmarks,&#xD;
      for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thoracic, abdominal, lumbar, and urologic&#xD;
      surgery. The ESPB was initially described to relieve chronic pain from metastatic disease and&#xD;
      rib fractures.&#xD;

      Chest wall pain is a severe and distressing symptom.Interventional pain management aims to&#xD;
      use invasive techniques such as joint injections, nerve blocks and/or neurolysis,&#xD;
      neuromodulation, and cement augmentation techniques to diagnose and treat pain syndromes&#xD;
      unresponsive to conventional medical management. The erector spinae plane block (ESPB) is an&#xD;
      interfascial plane block where local anesthetic (LA) is injected between the erector spine&#xD;
      muscle and the transverse process. It is a simple procedure, with easy sonographic landmarks,&#xD;
      for postoperative analgesia in patients undergoing thoracic, abdominal, lumbar, and urologic&#xD;
      surgery. The ESPB was initially described to relieve chronic pain from metastatic disease and&#xD;
      rib fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ESPB provides blockade of ventral and dorsal ramus from T1-2 to T8-12 with easy insertion&#xD;
      of a catheter into the distension induced by the injectate. It is performed away from the&#xD;
      pleura and neuraxis, with low risk of complications in these structures.To our knowledge it&#xD;
      is the first time study to evaluate the effectiveness of tramadol hydrochloride as adjuvant&#xD;
      to local anaesthetic in ultrasound guided ESPB in the management of chronic chest wall cancer&#xD;
      pain. Our hypothesis is that tramadol, when added to the local anaesthetic solution injected&#xD;
      for ESPB, may improve analgesia and decrease the opioid consumption in patients with chronic&#xD;
      chest wall cancer pain&#xD;

    <description>ESPPB will be performed at the T5 and T8 levels of the spine using an in-plane approach. A real-time ultrasound machine will be used to evaluate block performance. A high frequency linear ultrasound probe will be placed longitudinally at a distance of 3 cm from the midline. After identifying the erector spinae muscle and transverse processes, we will insert a 22 G, 100-mm needle after standard skin disinfection. It will be inserted in a caudal-to-cephalad direction using a sterile probe cover until the tip lay in the interfacial plane deep into the erector spinae muscle. This plane will be opened following hydrolocalization with normal saline then 30 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine will be injected slowly, with or without adjuvants, and aspirate every 5 ml to ensure block performance.</description>
