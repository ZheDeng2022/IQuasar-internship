  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Although the anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapies have gained significant results in patients with&#xD;
      relapsed and refractory B-cell hematologic malignancies. To make a further improvement,&#xD;
      adapting the FasT CAR-T cells manufacture technology to shorten the manufacturing time and&#xD;
      maintain the stemness of CAR-T cells. We launch such a clinical trial using CD19 targeted&#xD;
      CAR-T cells for patients with relapsed and refractory B-cell NHL to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of CD19 targeted CAR-T cell therapy.&#xD;
