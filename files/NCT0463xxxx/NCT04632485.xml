  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research is assess imaging and identification of soft plaque that&#xD;
      undergoes large deformations or strain will identify plaque vulnerable to rupture which could&#xD;
      lead to 'silent strokes'. Validation of current study results with MRI will foster use of&#xD;
      real-time ultrasound (US) strain imaging and strain indices as a screening tool for&#xD;
      identifying normal human participants susceptible to increased vascular aging and developing&#xD;
      plaque prone to rupture or micro-embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current research will evaluate Lagrangian carotid strain imaging (LCSI) for prediction of&#xD;
      vascular health on volunteers. In this study, investigators will evaluate age-related strain&#xD;
      variations (due to plaque deposition) in the carotid artery, establishing groundwork that&#xD;
      will help identify typical and atypical values for these indices. Investigator's hypothesis&#xD;
      is that plaques with higher strain indices (softer plaques) are more prone to rupture than&#xD;
      plaques with lower strain indices (stiffer) plaques, thus requiring intervention. Clinical&#xD;
      criteria for treatment has focused primarily on the degree of stenosis. Long-term objectives&#xD;
      are to provide non-invasive methods for screening participants at risk for vascular aging or&#xD;
      plaque rupture in asymptomatic participants, expanding upon current criteria for risk&#xD;
      assessments based on focal transient ischemic attack (TIA) or strokes. Variations in vessel&#xD;
      strain have been associated with, or are precursors to, plaque deposition, vascular aging, or&#xD;
      cerebrovascular diseases. Increased arterial strain and pressure changes have been linked to&#xD;
      brain aging using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) based vascular indices, and memory&#xD;
      deficits commonly linked to Alzheimer dementia. Stiffening and thickening of the arterial&#xD;
      walls have also been associated with cerebrovascular disease. Investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      strain indices as vascular biomarkers can be utilized for screening possible 'vulnerable&#xD;
      participants' validated with MRI, with the potential ability to improve endothelial function&#xD;
      and reverse vascular aging. Strain indices may enable differentiating study participants with&#xD;
      vascular cognitive impairment (VCI) from other dementias. Cognitive testing is unable to make&#xD;
      this differentiation.&#xD;

    <description>A sub-group of 40 at risk volunteers determined from the clinical ultrasound scans and bloodwork from Aim 1 will be asked to participate in a longitudinal US and MRI study. Participants will be selected from a population of individuals that do not have significant atherosclerosis, but present with increased risk due to the presence of soft, lipid rich plaque that are hypoechogenic or echolucent on ultrasound B-mode images. These participants may also satisfy the current clinical guidelines of increased vessel diameter and decreased blood flow velocity with ultrasound that may result in plaque deposition for being in the at risk population. Participants will receive US, strain and shear wave imaging every 2 years after the first scan in Aim 1 and MRI Imaging in Year 1 and Year 5: separated by 4 years</description>
