  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Combination treatment with antiangiogenic agents and anti-programmed cell death protein 1&#xD;
      (PD-1) antibodies have shown high anti-tumor efficacy for patients with unresectable or&#xD;
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). In this single-center cohort study, we are aiming&#xD;
      to (1) evaluate the clinical effectiveness in real-world patients, especially for Chinese&#xD;
      patients, most of whom were with hepatitis B virus infection; (2) predict clinical&#xD;
      effectiveness with clinicopathological features; (3) predict clinical effectiveness with&#xD;
      histologic features and blood samples.&#xD;

      Combination treatment with antiangiogenic agents and anti-programmed cell death protein 1&#xD;
      (PD-1) antibodies have shown high anti-tumor efficacy for patients with unresectable or&#xD;
      advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (uHCC). In this single-center cohort study, we are aiming&#xD;
      to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness in real-world patients, especially for Chinese&#xD;
           patients most of whom were with hepatitis B virus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To predict clinical effectiveness with clinicopathological features, such as lab&#xD;
           examinations (at baseline and dynamic changes), radiological features (radiomics study&#xD;
           at the baseline);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To predict clinical effectiveness with histologic features, such as PD-L1 expression,&#xD;
           ctDNA, and peripheral immune cell subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the clinical effectiveness of second- or third-line therapies, including&#xD;
           TACE, HAIC, and interferon, for those who lost clinical benefit or who were intolerant&#xD;
           to the combination therapy.&#xD;
