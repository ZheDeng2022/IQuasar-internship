  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) often have concomitant&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD) which may adversely affect prognosis. There is uncertainty&#xD;
      about the benefits and the optimal timing of revascularization for such patients. There is&#xD;
      currently clinical equipoise regarding the management of concomitant CAD in patients&#xD;
      undergoing TAVR. Some centers perform routine revascularization with percutaneous coronary&#xD;
      intervention (PCI) (either before or after TAVR), while others follow an alternative strategy&#xD;
      of medical management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential benefits and optimal timing of PCI in these patients are unknown. As TAVR&#xD;
      expands to lower risk patients, and potentially becomes the preferred therapy for the&#xD;
      majority of patients with severe aortic stenosis, the optimal management of concomitant&#xD;
      coronary artery disease will be of increasing importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The COMPLETE TAVR study will determine whether, on a background of guideline-directed medical&#xD;
      therapy, a strategy of complete revascularization involving staged PCI using drug eluting&#xD;
      stents to treat all suitable coronary artery lesions is superior to a strategy of medical&#xD;
      therapy alone in reducing the composite outcome of Cardiovascular Death, new Myocardial&#xD;
      Infarction, Ischemia-driven Revascularization or Hospitalization for Unstable Angina or Heart&#xD;
      Failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a randomized, multicenter, open-label trial with blinded adjudication of&#xD;
      outcomes. Patients will be screened and consented for elective transfemoral TAVR and&#xD;
      randomized within 24 hours of successful balloon expandable TAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complete Revascularization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staged PCI using third generation drug eluting stents to treat all suitable coronary artery&#xD;
      lesions in vessels that are at least 2.5 mm in diameter and that are amenable to treatment&#xD;
      with PCI and have a &gt;70% visual angiographic diameter stenosis. Staged PCI can occur any time&#xD;
      from 1 to 45 days post successful transfemoral TAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vs. Medical Therapy Alone:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No further revascularization of coronary artery lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients, regardless of randomized treatment allocation, will receive guideline-directed&#xD;
      medical therapy consisting of risk factor modification and use of evidence-based therapies&#xD;
      The COMPLETE TAVR study will help address the current lack of evidence in this area. It will&#xD;
      likely impact both the global delivery of health care and the management and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of all patients undergoing TAVR with concomitant CAD.&#xD;
