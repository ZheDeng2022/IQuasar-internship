      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject must be either male or non-pregnant female ≥ 18 years of age with an expected&#xD;
             lifespan sufficient to allow for completion of all study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject must voluntarily sign and date the Informed Consent Form (ICF) prior to&#xD;
             collection of study data or performance of study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject must be willing to comply with the protocol requirements, including clinical&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who have established, non-reversible kidney failure, who are currently on&#xD;
             dialysis at screening or are in immediate need (within 6 months of endoAVF creation)&#xD;
             of dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Target treatment vein diameter(s) for endoAVF creation ≥ 2.0 mm as measured via Duplex&#xD;
             Ultrasound (DUS) or Venography.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Target treatment artery diameter ≥ 2.0 mm as measured via Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) or&#xD;
             Arteriogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has adequate collateral circulation to the hand, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. At least one superficial outflow vein diameter ≥ 2.5 mm and in communication with the&#xD;
             target creation site via a proximal forearm perforating vein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The subject is in a hypercoagulable state.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The subject has known bleeding diathesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The subject has insufficient cardiac output to support a native fistula in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known history of active intravenous drug abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. &quot;Planned&quot; major surgical procedure within 6 months following index procedure or major&#xD;
             surgery within 30 days prior to index procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. The subject has a known allergy or hypersensitivity to contrast media which cannot be&#xD;
             adequately pre-medicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. The subject has known adverse effects to sedation and/or anesthesia which cannot be&#xD;
             adequately pre-medicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Evidence of active infection on the day of the index procedure (temperature of ≥ 38.0°&#xD;
             Celsius and/ or WBC of ≥ 12,000 cells/ μL, if collected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. The subject has another medical condition, which, in the opinion of the Investigator,&#xD;
             may cause him/her to be non-compliant with the protocol, confound the data&#xD;
             interpretation, or is associated with a life expectancy insufficient to allow for the&#xD;
             completion of study procedures and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. The subject is currently participating in an investigational drug or another device&#xD;
             study that has not completed the study treatment or that clinically interferes with&#xD;
             the study endpoints. Note: Studies requiring extended follow-up visits for products&#xD;
             that were investigational, but have since become commercially available, are not&#xD;
             considered investigational studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. The subject has central venous stenosis or central vein narrowing &gt; 50% based on&#xD;
             imaging on the same side as the planned endoAVF creation.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Absence of a proximal forearm perforating vein feeding the target cannulation vein(s)&#xD;
             from the target creation site via Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) or Venography.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Occlusion or stenosis &gt; 50% of target cannulation vein(s) such as cephalic, median&#xD;
             cubital, basilic, etc. assessed via Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) or Venography.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Significantly compromised venous or arterial flow in the treatment arm as determined&#xD;
             by Investigator and Duplex Ultrasound (DUS) or Venography.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Presence of significant calcification at the target endoAVF location that could&#xD;
             potentially impact the effectiveness of endoAVF creation as determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
