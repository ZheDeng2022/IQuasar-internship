  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this project is to study how an the intensity of dog contact during dog visits in&#xD;
      nursing homes can affect the immediate response to, and the general effect of the visits, and&#xD;
      whether the residents' level of cognitive impairment affects the response and benefit of dog&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants are randomly assigned to receive one type of visits (12 visits in total) out&#xD;
      of three possible visit types (1: visit with a dog; 2: visit with a dog, including a planned&#xD;
      activity, 3 visit without a dog, including a planned activity). The residents received 2&#xD;
      visits per week for 6 weeks. The behaviour of the participants during visits is recorded.&#xD;
      Before and after the intervention period, participants are scores on psychometric scales for&#xD;
      cognitive impairment level, daily function level and symptoms of depression.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The design of the study is a stratified and randomized complete block design. Each nursing home is a block. The participants are allocated randomly to one of the three visit types (1) Visits with a dog, no activity (D); 2) Visits with a dog, with activity (DA); or 3) Visits without dog, with an activity (A), balancing for the level of cognitive impairment, measured by the MMSE-scale. This was achieved by ranking the participants according to MMSE score within sex and allocating them to the three visit types by using different numerical orders in each nursing home (1, 2, 3; 3, 1, 2; 2, 3, 1 etc.).</intervention_model_description>

    <time_frame>Behaviour is recorded in all of the 12 visits in the 6 week intervention period</time_frame>
    <description>The behaviour of the residents is recorded by direct observation using continuous recording. In all visits, the frequency and duration of talk and physical contact to the persons present are recorded. Talk is classified into talk about the dog and/or activity, depending on the visit type. In visits with dogs (D, DA), the frequency and duration of physical contact and talk directed to the dog are recorded, and in visits involving an activity (DA, A), the frequency and duration of the residents' involvement in the activity are recorded.</description>

    <measure>Cognitive impairment level, before intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure is obtained in the week preceeding the intervention period (6 weeks, 2 visits )</time_frame>
    <description>All participants were scored on the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE), which gives information about the participants' cognitive status.The MMSE score has a minimum and maximum value of 0 and 30, respectively. The lower the score, the more severe the cognitively impairment level.</description>

    <measure>Daily function level, before intervention</measure>
    <time_frame>This measure is obtained in the week preceeding the intervention period (6 weeks, 2 visits )</time_frame>
    <description>All participants were scored on The Gottfries-Bråne-Steen Scale (GBS), which is an evaluation of disabilities, language, psychiatric symptoms, average daily living function, and behaviour of the participants. The GBS score has a minimum and maximum value of 0 and 156, respectively. The lower the score, the more well-functioning the patient.</description>

    <description>All participants were scored on the Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS), to screen for symptoms of depression. The GDS score has a minimum and maximum value of 0 and 15, respectively.A high score indicates more symptoms of depression.</description>
