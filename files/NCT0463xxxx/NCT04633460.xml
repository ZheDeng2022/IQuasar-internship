  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test whether a ketone ester drink will improve exercise in&#xD;
      people with heart failure (HF) compared to a placebo. In HF, patients are limited in their&#xD;
      ability to do all the things they want to do, and exercise as much as they would like, due to&#xD;
      becoming tired and short of breath early. There may be several reasons why these symptoms&#xD;
      occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence that in addition to problems with the heart, patients with HF also&#xD;
      have problems with their arteries and muscles that affect their ability to exercise. Ketones&#xD;
      have been shown to improve exercise capacity in healthy volunteers, which may be related to&#xD;
      effects on the heart function or on muscles. An infusion of ketones through an intravenous&#xD;
      (IV) line has also been shown to significantly improve heart function, but whether a drink&#xD;
      can produce similar improvements in HF patients is not known. This drink has been given&#xD;
      status by Food and Drug Administration as &quot;generally regarded as safe&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of DeltaG in this study is experimental. DeltaG has not been approved by the Food and&#xD;
      Drug Administration (FDA) for the use being evaluated in this study.&#xD;
