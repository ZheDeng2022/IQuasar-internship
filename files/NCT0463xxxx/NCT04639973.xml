      The purpose of this study is to assess the feasibility of ultrasound in the first trimester,&#xD;
      assess the completion rate of ultrasounds for fetal anatomy in the first trimester compared&#xD;
      to completion rates of ultrasounds for fetal anatomy in the second trimester and to assess&#xD;
      the completion rate of the combination of one ultrasound in the first trimester and one in&#xD;
      the second trimesters compared to the individual completion rates of both evaluations in&#xD;
      obese pregnant women.&#xD;

    <description>A detailed first trimester anatomy ultrasound will be performed,at the visit when the subject is confirmed to be of eligible gestational age. After this detailed research ultrasound, which will be limited to 15 minutes, subject will then receive the clinically indicated dating ultrasound or nuchal translucency measurement. The patient will complete a survey about her satisfaction with this technique via email.as a safety measure, if an anomaly is suspected on the day of the detailed first trimester anatomy scan, the patient will be unblinded. Patients in this arm are later scheduled for a second trimester ultrasound by the clinical team, as this is part of standard obstetrical care.</description>

    <description>Patients do not undergo a detailed first trimester ultrasound , but will receive the clinically indicated limited ultrasound for dating or for nuchal translucency. Patient will then undergoes a second trimester ultrasound by the clinical team as part of standard obstetrical care and completes a survey regarding her satisfaction with this technique via email.</description>
