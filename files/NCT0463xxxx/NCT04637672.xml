  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Myositis are rare diseases for which the development of a cohort associated with a bank of&#xD;
      biological samples (biobank) will allow for the conduct of researches to better delineate the&#xD;
      underlying pathophysiology and find cures. This prospective cohort of patients with myositis&#xD;
      will allow for identification of factors favouring the occurrence of myositis, whether they&#xD;
      are constitutional (genetic) or acquired (environmental or drug). Different subgroups of&#xD;
      myositis used for prognostication will be identified based on clinico-demographical&#xD;
      variables, the nature of the organs involved beyond peripheral muscles (cardiac, diaphragm)&#xD;
      and biomarkers abnormalities.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myositis is a rare autoimmune disease in which the immune system mistakenly attacks the&#xD;
      patient's own peripheral muscles. This aggression manifests by muscle inflammation and&#xD;
      necrosis responsible for a motor deficit of varying severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatments available today are insufficient and are non-specific. Biological criteria,&#xD;
      issued from simple blood or muscle tests are missing, and they will help to define the&#xD;
      activity of the disease and the efficacy of treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MASC protocol will include patients with myositis, and investigators will collect&#xD;
      clinical, radiological, electrophysiological, histological and biological data to be used for&#xD;
      researches aiming at better understanding this entity. A biobank (muscle biopsy, DNA, serum,&#xD;
      plasma, PBMCs) will be acquired on this prospective cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study itself will be composed of a baseline visit and monthly to yearly follow-up visits&#xD;
      which will assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical examination with an evaluation of the muscle strength and function&#xD;
           impairment/handicap, including but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Manual testing of proximal axial and distal muscles on the five points Medical&#xD;
                Research Council (MRC) scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Barré tests and Mingazzini tests, number of stand-up / sitting, leg crossing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biometry, lab and radiological measurements: muscle enzymes (creatine phosphokinase CPK,&#xD;
           troponin, C-reactive protein, quantification of autoantibodies, muscle MRI, muscle&#xD;
           biopsy, thorax tomodensitometry, pulmonary test function&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extra-muscular evaluation: cardiac examination and work-up (echocardiography, cardiac&#xD;
           MRI and Positron Emission Tomography (PET) scanner, cardiac biopsies), pulmonary&#xD;
           evaluation, rheumatological and dermatological assessment, history of thromboembolic&#xD;
           disease and cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient activity assessment: evaluation of daily life activity by both patient and physician&#xD;
      using a Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the efficacy and toxicity of specific treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient, the date of last visit or contact will be collected as well as outcomes,&#xD;
      particularly for the cause of death if relevant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the biobank MASC &quot; Muscles DNA/RNA Serum and Cells &quot; will be added to other data.&#xD;
      The biobank has been fully registered with local authorities and ethical committees&#xD;
      (&quot;Committee for Personal Protection (CPP)&quot; CPP agreement). It contains peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells (PBMC), serum, DNA and RNA from blood and muscular biopsies collected at&#xD;
      the diagnosis stage. The database contains immunological and genetical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study will also aim at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify the differential pathophysiological processes between the different subgroups&#xD;
           of myositis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify prognostic factors, including the different treatment modalities used&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve physiopathological knowledge (clinico-anatomobiological characteristics and&#xD;
           identification of other biomarkers through the biobank)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improve the evaluation of the clinical outcomes/endpoints for future trials&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop clinical trials for homogeneous subgroups of patients, based on their&#xD;
           pathophysiology and evaluated on the appropriate endpoints.&#xD;
