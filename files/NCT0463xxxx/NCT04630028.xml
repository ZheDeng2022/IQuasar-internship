&#xD;
          -  Must have had UC diagnosed prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have moderately to severely active UC, defined as a baseline Mayo score of 6 through&#xD;
             12, inclusive, with a screening Mayo endoscopy subscore greater than or equal to (&gt;=)&#xD;
             2 as determined by a central review of the video of the endoscopy&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have UC limited to the rectum only or to less than (&lt;) 20 centimeter (cm) of the colon&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of colonic or small bowel obstruction within 6 months prior to&#xD;
             screening, confirmed by objective radiographic or endoscopic evidence of a stricture&#xD;
             with resulting obstruction (dilation of the colon or small bowel proximal to the&#xD;
             stricture on barium radiograph or an inability to traverse the stricture at endoscopy)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of latent or active granulomatous infection, including tuberculosis&#xD;
             (TB), histoplasmosis, or coccidioidomycosis, or have had a nontuberculous&#xD;
             mycobacterial infection prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence or history of any malignancy including presence or history of&#xD;
             lymphoproliferative disease including lymphoma, or signs and symptoms suggestive of&#xD;
             possible lymphoproliferative disease, such as lymphadenopathy of unusual size or&#xD;
             location (example, nodes in the posterior triangle of the neck, infraclavicular,&#xD;
             epitrochlear, or periaortic areas) and monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined&#xD;
             significance, or clinically significant hepatomegaly or splenomegaly&#xD;
