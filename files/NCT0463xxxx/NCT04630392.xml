  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Whole-body vibration (WBV) and treadmill training (TT) are commonly-utilized rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions for children with neuromotor disorders. WBV has been shown in the literature to&#xD;
      positively affect gait and lower body spasticity in this population. However, the effects of&#xD;
      a single session of WBV are generally transient, lasting between ten minutes and two hours.&#xD;
      Thus, it may be necessary to combine WBV with another intervention to reinforce improved&#xD;
      movement patterns and maximize its potential benefits. Therefore, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of the addition of a single bout of WBV to a single bout of TT on the&#xD;
      lower extremity spasticity and gait parameters of ambulatory children with CP.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Whole-body vibration (WBV) and treadmill training (TT) are commonly-utilized rehabilitation&#xD;
      interventions for children with neuromotor disorders. The evidence supporting the use of TT&#xD;
      in children with cerebral palsy (CP) remains inconclusive, but WBV has been shown in the&#xD;
      literature to positively affect gait and lower body spasticity in this population. However,&#xD;
      the effects of a single session of WBV are generally transient, lasting between ten minutes&#xD;
      and two hours. Thus, it may be necessary to combine WBV with another intervention to&#xD;
      reinforce improved movement patterns and maximize its potential benefits. Therefore, the aim&#xD;
      of this study is to investigate the effects of the addition of a single bout of WBV to a&#xD;
      single bout of TT on the lower extremity spasticity and gait parameters of ambulatory&#xD;
      children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to recruit 20 children between the ages of 6 and 17 with spastic CP.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete a 10-minute bout of TT at 110% of their preferred overground (OG)&#xD;
      walking speed, rest for 15 minutes, and then complete a 12-minute bout of WBV at 20Hz and 2mm&#xD;
      followed by a second 10-minute bout of TT at the same speed. OG gait characteristics,&#xD;
      including spatiotemporal parameters, joint kinematics, and electromyographic (EMG)&#xD;
      parameters, will be collected at 5 time points: before the first bout of TT, immediately&#xD;
      following the first bout of TT, before WBV, immediately following WBV, and immediately&#xD;
      following the second bout of TT. Lower extremity spasticity will be assessed using multiple&#xD;
      methods at the same time points. Changes in gait parameters and spasticity will be assessed&#xD;
      using a one-way repeated measures ANOVA and a series of dependent t-tests. Significant level&#xD;
      will be set at Î± = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that acute improvements in OG gait parameters will be greater&#xD;
      following the combined bout of WBV and TT than the bout of TT alone. The investigators expect&#xD;
      this to be due to the reduction of lower extremity spasticity following WBV, which should&#xD;
      allow for more normalized gait patterns during TT and improve carryover to OG gait. Further,&#xD;
      the investigators expect to gain insight into the mechanisms responsible for spasticity&#xD;
      reduction following WBV which will allow for the making of informed decisions regarding&#xD;
      clinical rehabilitative protocols involving WBV and TT.&#xD;
