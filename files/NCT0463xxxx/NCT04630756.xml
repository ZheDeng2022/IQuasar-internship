  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a modular, multicentre, open-label, non-randomised, Phase I/II, dose-setting and&#xD;
      expansion study including an intra-participant ramp-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AZD4573 will be administered intravenously, in novel combinations with anti-cancer agents, to&#xD;
      participants with relapsed/refractory haematological malignancies.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Module 1 Part A (dose-setting), this study module will initially explore once weekly&#xD;
      administration of AZD4573 at up to three target dose levels in combination with oral&#xD;
      acalabrutinib 100 mg twice daily and will enroll participants with Diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (DLBCL), based on the observation of complete and partial responses amongst DLBCL&#xD;
      patients treated with monotherapy. The primary objective of Part A will be to identify the&#xD;
      maximum tolerated dose and/or Recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) for further evaluation in Part&#xD;
      B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Module 1 Part B (expansion), separate expansion cohorts for participants with Germinal&#xD;
      Centre B-cell (GCB) and non-GCB DLBCL subtypes will be opened at the RP2D.&#xD;
