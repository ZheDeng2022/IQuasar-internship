      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety and feasibility of implanting an&#xD;
      engineered cartilage tissue in an interposition graft with a temporoparietal fascia (TPF)&#xD;
      flap to repair medium size septal perforation. The engineered cartilage graft is obtained by&#xD;
      culturing expanded autologous nasal chondrocytes within a collagen type I/III membrane. In&#xD;
      addition, first data on efficacy will be collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nasal septum perforation (NSP) is a medical condition characterized by loss of cartilage&#xD;
      and/or bony structures of the nasal septum together with their mucoperichondrium and&#xD;
      mucoperiosteum. There are many causes for NSP like history of nasal surgery (iatrogenic),&#xD;
      trauma, self-inflicted injuries, drugs, chemical irritants, neoplastic causes, inflammatory&#xD;
      causes (vasculitides, Wegener's granulomatosis) or infections (syphilis, tuberculosis). The&#xD;
      perforation in the nasal septum creates pathological turbulences in the nasal airflow, which&#xD;
      result in a decrease of the normal humidification process. Depending on size and location of&#xD;
      the defect, this can lead to serious discomfort for patients and reduction of their quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the current treatment methods (use of synthetic material, PDS, or of native cartilage)&#xD;
      have disadvantages, the investigators want to show in a phase I study that the use of tissue&#xD;
      engineered autologous nasal cartilage to repair perforations (holes) in the area of the nasal&#xD;
      septum is suitable and safe. The engineered autologous nasal cartilage graft is used as a&#xD;
      replacement for PDS or native cartilage in an interposition graft in the reconstruction of&#xD;
      nasal septal perforations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the operation, the subjective symptoms of the patients are recorded using two&#xD;
      questionnaires: Nasal Obstruction Symptom Evaluation (NOSE) and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and&#xD;
      objective examinations are carried out with functional tests (rhinomanometry, acoustic&#xD;
      rhinometry) and imaging (endoscopy, CT scans). A small biopsy taken from the nasal septum is&#xD;
      processed in the laboratory, chondrocytes are isolated, expanded and cultured onto a collagen&#xD;
      matrix to generate a tissue engineered cartilage graft. Subsequently, the engineered&#xD;
      cartilage is implanted into the defect of the nasal septum. In the postoperative follow up at&#xD;
      6 weeks, 3, 6 and 12 months, the investigators examine whether the nasal septum is closed,&#xD;
      the subjective symptoms of the patients are recorded and the objective measurements are&#xD;
      carried out in order to compare them with the findings before the operation. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to show safety and feasibility and to gain initial data on effectiveness of this&#xD;
      treatment (improvement of symptoms).&#xD;
