      This study will test the feasibility, acceptability, usability, satisfaction and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of a behavioral (psychoeducation) intervention. All participants will receive the&#xD;
      standard post-hospital HSCT information for patient follow-up care as provided by the&#xD;
      patient's oncologist. In addition, the all participants will receive 4 individual sessions&#xD;
      with an interventionist.&#xD;

    <description>Caregiver Acceptability as measured by Acceptability Scale scores. Overall score ranging from 6-30. According to prior research, a score of 80% of higher (total score of 24 or higher) is considered acceptable for use.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>System Usability Scale scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver Usability as measured by the System Usability Scale. This is a 10 item scale scored on a 5 point Likert scale with total summed scores ranging from 0-50. Total scores are multiplied by 2 to produce an overall score ranging from 0-100 with scores &gt; 68 considered to be above average usability</description>

    <measure>Mean caregiver satisfaction scores</measure>
    <time_frame>At the end of each intervention session and end of study evaluation, up to 2 months</time_frame>
    <description>Caregiver Satisfaction scores as measured by Likert Scale. After completing each module, they will be sent via REDCap a single item evaluation scale (0 -10; 0=Not at all satisfied; 10=Highly satisfied). Scores &gt;7 will be considered acceptable. Mean and standard deviation will be reported.</description>
