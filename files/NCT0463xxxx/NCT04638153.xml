    <textblock>
      Approximately 63 participants will be randomized to one of three doses to receive Recifercept&#xD;
      either&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medium Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will will attend the clinic at baseline and at Day 1, 4, 8, 15, 29 &amp; then Month&#xD;
      2, 3 6, 9 &amp; 12. Assessments include safety, blood sampling, physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs, anthropometric body measurements &amp; patient/caregiver quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will received treatment with Recifercept for 12 months. All participants who&#xD;
      complete the study and in the opinion of the investigator, continue to have a positive&#xD;
      risk:benefit profile, will be offered to enroll into an open-label extension (OLE) study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2 randomized, 3 arm (3 active doses of Recifercept), parallel group dose&#xD;
      finding study of safety, tolerability, PK and efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total number of participants is 63 in 2 age straified cohorts of 0-2 years and 6-10 years&#xD;
      old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 54 children with achondroplasia aged 2-10 years&#xD;
      (inclusive) who will be enrolled and randomized to receive one of three doses of recifercept&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Low Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medium Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 18 participants will be enrolled per dose 18 per dosesuch that at least 15&#xD;
      participants per dose are evaluable. An interim analysis is planned when at least 15&#xD;
      participants per dose aged ≥2 to &lt;11 years have received 6 months of treatment with&#xD;
      recifercept. eDMC will review safety, PK and efficacy data to confirm ongoing positive&#xD;
      benefit:risk in participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, an exploratory cohort of approximately 9 children with achondroplasia, ages 0-2&#xD;
      years, will be enrolled later in the study (n=3 per dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will follow an age and dose-staggered approach (descending age and ascending dose)&#xD;
      with review of safety and PK data by the study team before progression to the next enrollment&#xD;
      block If certain pre-defined safety signals occur then a meeting of the eDMC will be convened&#xD;
      to make a decision on progression of enrollment. The PK data collected in block A will be&#xD;
      used in the PopPK model (developed using healthy adult data) to confirm the dosing for&#xD;
      younger children (ie, ≥2 to &lt;6 years and 0-&lt;2 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will will attend the clinic at baseline and at Day 1, 4, 8, 15, 29 &amp; then Month&#xD;
      2, 3 6, 9 &amp; 12. Assessments include safety, blood sampling, physical examination, vital&#xD;
      signs, anthropometric body measurements &amp; patient/caregiver quality of life questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive recifercept for 12 months. All participants who complete the&#xD;
      study and in the opinion of the investigator, continue to have a positive risk:benefit&#xD;
      profile, will be offered to enroll into an open-label extension (OLE) study.&#xD;

    <description>Treatment-related AE was any untoward medical occurrence attributed to study drug in a participant who received study drug. Serious adverse event (SAE) was an AE resulting in any of the following outcomes or deemed significant for any other reason: death; initial or prolonged inpatient hospitalization; life-threatening experience (immediate risk of dying); persistent or significant disability/incapacity; congenital anomaly. Treatment-emergent are events between first dose of study drug and up to 365 days after last dose that were absent before treatment or that worsened relative to pretreatment state. Relatedness to Recifercept was assessed by the investigator (Yes/No). Participants with multiple occurrences of an AE within a category were counted once within the category.</description>

The QoLISSY Brief questions ask the participant or caregiver about their status currently. Intended for children or caregivers of children, the instrument uses a 5-point Likert Scale ranging from 'not at all/never' to 'extremely/always'. The QoLISSY Brief total score is the 0-100 transformed sum of the 9 item scores, with higher scores representing better quality of life.</description>
