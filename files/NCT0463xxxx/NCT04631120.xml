  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dementia patients experience memory and other cognitive function deterioration leading to&#xD;
      loss of independent function. Care required for dementia is multifactorial, spanning&#xD;
      cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and physical symptoms, and complicates aspects of daily&#xD;
      living. This places tremendous strain on caregivers who, in turn, experience their own&#xD;
      increased physical and mental health needs. The current care model focuses primarily on&#xD;
      patient pharmacological management but misses the mark on caregiver focus and collaboration.&#xD;
      Building on systematic reviews and existing evidence gaps in information and support for&#xD;
      patient/caregiver dyads, dealing with behavioral symptoms, referrals to available community&#xD;
      resources, and multidisciplinary team care with improved coordination and communication17,&#xD;
      the study investigators propose a patient- and caregiver-targeted Integrated Dementia&#xD;
      Practice Unit (IDPU) model of care. IDPU integrates disconnected care under a centralized&#xD;
      specialty team, providing monitoring, education, individualized support, and proactive,&#xD;
      ongoing collaboration and coaching using technology and home/virtual visits for maximal&#xD;
      impact. Days alive at home (DAAH) best captures quality of life (QOL) for the index dementia&#xD;
      patient, from the perspective of both the healthcare system and the caregiver, and degree of&#xD;
      support for the caregiver and is often an outcome in assessing health delivery. The study&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize IDPU will increase DAAH and improve patient-level (behavioral;&#xD;
      depressive symptoms; chronic disease management) and caregiver-level (strain, depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, social support) outcomes relative to an Educational+ model, merging a standard care&#xD;
      design with additional education support for patients/caregivers and their Primary Care&#xD;
      Providers (PCP). This study seeks to (a) improve and establish IDPU feasibility of the in the&#xD;
      feasibility phase, (b) determine if IDPU is more effective than Education+ in increasing DAAH&#xD;
      and patient- and caregiver-level outcomes, and (c) determine if benefits of IDPU are more or&#xD;
      less pronounced in vulnerable subgroups in the full-scale study.&#xD;

    <measure>Assessment of Perceived Strain in Caregivers</measure>
    <time_frame>24 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of change in perceived strain in caregivers using Zarit Burden Interview. The ZBI uses a 4-point ordinal scale which describes the degree of burden being experienced from 0 = never to 4 = almost always. Maximum score is 88 and higher scores indicate more burden.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of Caregiver Stress</measure>

    <description>Measurement of change in caregiver stress using NPI Caregiver Distress Scale. Caregiver distress associated with the symptom is rated on an anchored 0- to 5-point scale identical to that used in the NPI. 12 The total NPI-Q distress score represents the sum of individual symptom scores and ranges from 0 to 60.</description>

    <description>The proposed arm will involve an initial assessment using the Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) Scale and Atherosclerotic Cardiovascular Disease (ASCVD) Risk Score for patients and Zarit Burden Interview (ZBI) for caregiver, followed by provision of standard educational material from the AA and Association for the Advancement of Retired Persons (AARP). Two phone sessions with a study nurse will occur post-enrollment in months 1 and 6 to discuss the educational material and perform a needs assessment; a summary of these and professional education on national evidence-based guidelines will be mailed to the patient's PCP of record. Education provided in this arm will be both patient- and caregiver-centered.</description>

    <description>The integrated practice unit design is a coordinated, team-based, comprehensive, technology enabled, family focused care delivery design comprised of:&#xD;
Dementia Central: Nurses, physicians, psychologists, social workers, and other relevant healthcare providers that will meet monthly to review participants progress and issues. Telehealth visits would facilitate home care.&#xD;
Dementia Mobile: A nurse and lay health educator team will perform monthly visits, conduct assessments of subjects and provide education/coaching.&#xD;
Dementia Link: Technologies that facilitate communication between Dementia Central and Dementia Mobile and foster proactive collaboration/coaching for study subjects include an mHealth software that allows for real time intervention/communication between professional teams and dyads, combined with management of dyads for multiple parameters like health metrics, behavioral measures and stress management and a portal tailored to specific clinical needs.</description>
