  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The features of CAI were confirmed through studies that 64% to 77% had extra-articular&#xD;
      conditions mainly related to calf tendon disorder. In addition, joints are laxity, sensory&#xD;
      motors are deficient, and the range of dorsi flexion is decreased. this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the effects of active joint mobilization(AJM) under weight-bearing conditions to&#xD;
      stimulate various proprioceptors for CAI with deficiency in sensorimotor and postural&#xD;
      control.&#xD;

    <description>Consists of 9 questions, 3 to 0 points for 5 questions, 4 to 0 points for 2 questions, 5 to 0 points for 1 question, and 2 to 0 points for another question. A total score of 30 points is the highest, 28 points or more are stable ankle joints, and 24 points or less are unstable ankle joints. The higher the score, the closer to normal, and the lower the score, the lower the stability.</description>

    <description>Measured based on the accelerometer sensor built into the mobile phone with a clinometer app. After fixing the mobile phone on the participant's sole, press &quot;0 clear&quot; to calibrate it to the initial value. The physical therapist asks the participant to &quot;flex the foot in the dorsal direction &quot; Measure a total of 2 times and record it as an average value.</description>

    <description>The participants bend his knees in a prone position. The physical therapist holds the medial malleolus with one hand and the lateral malleolus with the other. At the same time, the physical therapist touches the participant's soles to the sternum area and presses them in the dorsal direction. At this time, medial malleolus glides anterior and lateral malleolus glides posterior. The first procedure is to passively recognize movement. The second procedure is accompanied by active movement of the participant.</description>

    <description>PJM uses Maitland's Mobilization method, grade III (high amplitude in the end range of the joint and 1 second vibration in the middle range through linear motion in which tissue resistance is felt). The participant is in a supine position, and the physical therapist holds the talus with one hand and the tibia with the other hand, and performs joint mobilization in the posterior direction with the hand holding the talus.</description>
