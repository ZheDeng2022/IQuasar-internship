      GENFI Lille is a French cohort that belongs to the international initiative GENFI2, a five&#xD;
      year longitudinal biomarker cohort study of genetic FTD and its associated disorders&#xD;
      (including MND/ALS) investigating members of families with a known mutation in GRN or MAPT or&#xD;
      an expansion in C9orf72 (including those affected with the disorder as well as at-risk&#xD;
      members of families).&#xD;

      The purposes of this study is :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to improve characterization of symptomatic FTD patients or presymptomatic subjects at&#xD;
           risk of genetic FTD&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to develop markers indicative of the optimal time to start disease-modifying therapy,&#xD;
           based on the proximity to clinical onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to develop markers of disease progression that can be used as outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to derive sample size estimates for clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will include those affected with the disorder as well as at-risk members of&#xD;
      families (both mutation carriers and non-carrier first-degree relatives who will serve as a&#xD;
      control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be assessed longitudinally with a set of clinical, neuropsychiatric,&#xD;
      cognitive, imaging and biosample protocols.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must be 18 years old or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must be a member of a family with a known pathogenic mutation in the&#xD;
             GRN or MAPT genes, or with a pathogenic expansion in the C9orf72 gene :&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An affected member is one who has been clinically diagnosed by a neurologist as&#xD;
                  having frontotemporal dementia or a disorder in the FTD spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  An at-risk member is one who is a first-degree relative of a family member&#xD;
                  affected with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Pathogenicity of a GRN or MAPT mutation is defined by those included within the&#xD;
                  GENFI list of FTD mutation. If a novel mutation is discovered that is likely to&#xD;
                  be pathogenic and has not yet been included within the FTD mutation database then&#xD;
                  the GENFI Genetics Core will decide on inclusion. Please send an email to the&#xD;
                  GENFI Trials Team at genfi@ucl.ac.uk.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A pathogenic C9orf72 expansion is defined as greater than 30 repeats.&#xD;
                  Intermediate expansions are not considered pathogenic.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participants from one of the small number of families around the world in which 2&#xD;
                  (or more) pathogenic mutations have been found should not be included in GENFI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If the participant is demented or cognitively impaired there must be an available&#xD;
             caregiver that can escort them.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must have an identified informant.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant must be fluent in the language of their country of assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant accepts that genetic analysis will be carried out on his/her blood&#xD;
             samples, and that no results will be available neither for the investigator nor for&#xD;
             the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has another medical or psychiatric illness that would interfere in&#xD;
             completing assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindications to FDG-PET (allergy to FDG…)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant is pregnant.&#xD;
