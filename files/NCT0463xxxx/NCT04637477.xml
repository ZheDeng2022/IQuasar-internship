  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a proof-of-concept study of a virtual version of a lifestyle intervention aimed at&#xD;
      reducing cardiometabolic risk in patients with the Metabolic Syndrome (MetS). The aim is to&#xD;
      recruit 12 patients at high risk for coronavirus infection based upon a diagnosis of obesity&#xD;
      and the MetS, conduct a 12-week virtual version of the in-person intervention, and explore&#xD;
      efficacy using clinically significant pre-specified targets for weight, diet, physical&#xD;
      activity, stress, and markers of inflammation. In addition, the investigators will explore&#xD;
      safety, fidelity, feasibility, and acceptability.&#xD;
