  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospectively enrolling trial is to assess long-term cognitive outcomes&#xD;
      of patients undergoing surgery for resection of a meningioma associated with the frontal and&#xD;
      temporal lobes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at patients who are undergoing resection of a skull based meningioma,&#xD;
      located in the frontal or temporal lobe, via craniotomy or via endoscopic endonasal approach.&#xD;
      The study will compare cognitive function at baseline, at six weeks postoperatively and at&#xD;
      one year postoperatively. The cognitive testing being done at baseline will be a clinical&#xD;
      care set of assessments done by the speech language pathology team and will include the RBANS&#xD;
      tests, the MoCA, PROMIS-29, and NeuroQOL-Cognitive Functions.&#xD;

        Patients between 18 years of age and 89 years of age will be eligible for this study.&#xD;
        Patients undergoing a resection of a meningioma located in the frontal or temporal lobes&#xD;
        via craniotomy or endoscopic endonasal surgery for clinical purposes will be included.&#xD;
        Should a patient have a previous surgical removal of a meningioma, they will still be&#xD;
        included. However, all patients having undergone previous radiation to the brain, for any&#xD;
        reason, will not be included in the study.&#xD;
