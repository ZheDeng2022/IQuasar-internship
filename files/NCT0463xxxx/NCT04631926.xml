      This is a prospective cohort study of 30 older women ages 65 and older with urinary&#xD;
      incontinence (UI) who will under go a standardized 12-week hip muscle exercises (isometric&#xD;
      strengthening of hip external rotators with progressive resistance training). Participants&#xD;
      will take part in a 12-week hip muscle exercise program (weekly supervised hip exercises with&#xD;
      resistance progression) plus a home program with the same exercises 3 days per week. the&#xD;
      exercise program will be administered by the licensed physical therapist with special focus&#xD;
      in hip strength. The change in pelvic floor muscle strength (peak pelvic floor muscle squeeze&#xD;
      pressures) pre- to post hip muscle exercises. Changes in UI symptom severity, and impact of&#xD;
      UI symptoms on quality of life will be assessed. Objective measurement of pelvic floor muscle&#xD;
      strength will be obtained using a perineometer. UI symptom severity and quality of life will&#xD;
      be measured using validated questionnaires (PFDI and PFIQ, respectively).&#xD;
