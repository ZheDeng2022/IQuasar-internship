&#xD;
          -  Patients who had non-advanced disease (Stage I/II or missing information on Staging)&#xD;
             at diagnosis but advanced at a later date during the study period (proxied by receipt&#xD;
             of a SACT treatment indicative of advanced RCC)&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of concomitant tumour apart from non-melanoma skin cancer in the three years&#xD;
             prior to the diagnosis of aRCC&#xD;
