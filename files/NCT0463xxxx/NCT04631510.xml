  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sleep disruption in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a common comorbidity associated with&#xD;
      patient morbidity and distress. There are no recommended pharmacologic interventions for&#xD;
      sleep promotion, and many pharmacologic solutions may actually increase the risk of adverse&#xD;
      outcomes rather than impart benefits. Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant with applications in&#xD;
      neuropathic pain, has been investigated for sleep promotion in various populations of&#xD;
      outpatients. Here investigators propose a pilot study of gabapentin as a therapy for sleep&#xD;
      disruption in the ICU. Outcomes measured will be sleep quality as measured by RCSQ&#xD;
      (Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire), wrist actigraphy, EEG, and BIS monitoring. The goal&#xD;
      is to enroll 80 critically ill patients, 40 intubated and 40 non-intubated patients. The&#xD;
      study will take place over 2 nights, with baseline sleep measurements occurring on the first&#xD;
      night and gabapentin administration with repeat sleep measurements on the second night.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sleep disruption in the intensive care unit (ICU) is a common comorbidity. In addition to&#xD;
      being a source of emotional distress for many patients, sleep disturbance may be associated&#xD;
      with ICU delirium, prolonged need for respiratory support, and immune and neurocognitive&#xD;
      dysfunction. Since sleep is a potentially modifiable risk factor for ICU outcomes, there has&#xD;
      been increased interest in sleep study and promotion in critically ill patients, as evidenced&#xD;
      by the inclusion of sleep disruption in the 2018 Society of Critical Care Medicine Clinical&#xD;
      Practice Guidelines. Although these Guidelines make soft recommendations for&#xD;
      non-pharmacologic strategies to improve sleep in this patient population, these strategies&#xD;
      are often lacking in efficacy and/or evidence. There are no recommended pharmacologic&#xD;
      interventions for sleep promotion, and many pharmacologic solutions may actually increase the&#xD;
      risk of adverse outcomes rather than impart benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin, an anticonvulsant with applications in neuropathic pain, has been investigated&#xD;
      for sleep promotion in various populations of outpatients. In non-ICU patients, gabapentin is&#xD;
      an effective therapy for insomnia in patients with restless leg syndrome or chronic&#xD;
      neuropathy. Even in patients without these comorbidities, gabapentin has shown efficacy&#xD;
      compared with placebo in improving sleep duration and depth. Gabapentin has several&#xD;
      advantages compared to common sedatives used in the ICU, including no increased day&#xD;
      drowsiness, no QTc prolongation, and some studies suggesting no association with delirium,&#xD;
      particularly when used in a daily dose &lt; 600 mg. Although caution must be used in dosing this&#xD;
      drug in patients with renal dysfunction, a dose of up to 300 mg daily may be used if CrCl &lt;&#xD;
      15 ml/m, and doses of up to 300 mg after hemodialysis (HD) have been used safely in patients&#xD;
      with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Additionally, its generic status and broad therapeutic&#xD;
      index make it a cost-effective and attractive agent for further study and use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here investigators propose a pilot study of gabapentin as a therapy for sleep disruption in&#xD;
      the ICU. To date, there have been no studies of gabapentin use for sleep in the ICU; this&#xD;
      study would represent the first of its kind. Given the magnitude of the problem represented&#xD;
      by sleep disruption in the ICU, the ability of gabapentin to mitigate insomnia in&#xD;
      outpatients, and the low side effect profile and wide therapeutic window of gabapentin,&#xD;
      studying the effects of gabapentin on sleep disruption in the ICU is a logical and&#xD;
      potentially practice changing step.&#xD;
