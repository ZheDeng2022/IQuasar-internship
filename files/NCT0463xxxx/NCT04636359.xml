    <textblock>
      This study recruits 30 subjects into three groups, including two experimental groups and one&#xD;
      control group. The two experimental groups receive acupuncture treatment for 4 weeks and two&#xD;
      times functional magnetic resonance imaging scans as well as clinical symptom assessments.&#xD;
      The control group receive one scan without any intervention. The aim of this study is to find&#xD;
      the whether the effect of acupuncture treatment have diversity among migraineurs with&#xD;
      different disease course.&#xD;

      This study recruits 10 patients with long course (&gt; 5 years) without aura migraine, 10&#xD;
      patients with short course (&lt; 5 years) without aura migraine and 10 healthy volunteers who&#xD;
      meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Among the study, two migraine patient groups&#xD;
      receive acupuncture treatment for 4 weeks, the frequency is 30 minutes each time, three times&#xD;
      a week. According to the national standard of the people's Republic of China (GB / T&#xD;
      12346-2006) acupoint name and location, the acupuncture treatment includes SJ23 (Si Zhu Kong,&#xD;
      unilateral), GB8 (Shuai Gu, unilateral), EX-HN5 (Tai Yang, unilateral), GB20 (Feng Chi,&#xD;
      unilateral), LI4 (He Gu, bilateral), GB41 (Zu Lin Qi, bilateral), GB34 (Yang Ling Quan,&#xD;
      bilateral) and SJ5 (Wai Guan, bilateral) acupoints. Both migraine patients receive scan in&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (Siemens 3.0T superconducting magnetic resonance&#xD;
      scanner, Germany) and symptom scale assessment before the first acupuncture stimulation and&#xD;
      post the last acupuncture stimulation. Healthy volunteers receive only one scanning without&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The data of this study includes two aspect, data of brain scans and data of clinical symptom scales. The latter data will be shared to other researchers who contact us via email. The former data, however, is a DICOM format data that hard to analysis in non specialists. Besides, the size of DICOM data is much big that we haven't enough funding to support it in website. Thus, we haven't decided to share this kind of dataset. Except for those data, other data within our study is willing to be share.&#xD;
