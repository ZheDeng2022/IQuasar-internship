  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to clinically evaluate the effects of a school-based behavioral&#xD;
      intervention, CATCH Healthy Smiles, to reduce the risk of dental caries in a cohort of&#xD;
      kindergarten through 2nd grade (K-2) children serving low-income, ethnically-diverse&#xD;
      children,to determine the impact of CATCH Healthy Smiles on child behavioral, psychosocial,&#xD;
      and environmental outcomes beginning in K through 2nd grade, compared to children in the&#xD;
      control schools and to examine the extent to which the child behavioral, psychosocial, and&#xD;
      environmental factors mediate the improvements in child caries risk.&#xD;
