  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators wish to investigate whether halophyte-based cream applied to&#xD;
      the skin can reduce itch applied by means of small needles from the plant mucuna pruriens&#xD;
      (also called cowhage) or by histamine (an itch-evoking substance formed in the human body).&#xD;
      Further, the investigators wishes to investigate whether long-term application of&#xD;
      halophyte-based cream has a pain-relieving effect on heat/cold and pinprick stimulations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Salt-tolerant plants (also called halophytes) can grow in saline soil or directly in salt&#xD;
      water (e.g. along coasts). For centuries, these plants have been used in folk medicine, and&#xD;
      among other things they are believed to have pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though experiments have already investigated halophytes as a pain relieving substance,&#xD;
      the mechanisms in relation to pain and/or itch are still unknown. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators wish to investigate whether halophyte-based cream applied to the skin can&#xD;
      reduce itch applied by means of small needles from the plant mucuna pruriens (also called&#xD;
      cowhage) or by histamine (an itch-evoking substance formed in the human body). Further, the&#xD;
      investigators wishes to investigate whether long-term application of halophyte-based cream&#xD;
      has a pain-relieving effect on heat/cold and pinprick stimulations.&#xD;

Starting with the lightest, each stimulator is applied at a rate of 2 s on, 2 s off in an ascending order until the first perception of sharpness is reached. The final threshold is the geometric mean of five series of ascending and descending stimuli.</description>
