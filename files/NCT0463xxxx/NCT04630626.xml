    <measure>Clinical Composite Success</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Individual success for Simplify Disc and the historical control Anterior Cervical Discectomy and Fusion (ACDF) is defined as follows:&#xD;
Improvement on the Neck Disability Index (NDI) of at least 15 percentage points compared to baseline in the Simplify Disc IDE study, and&#xD;
No device failures by Month 60, and&#xD;
No subsequent surgical procedure at the index level (including revision, removal, reoperation, or supplemental fixation) by Month 60.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Improvement in one or more radicular symptoms or myelopathy (neurological status)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Endpoint will be examined using Neurological Status (motor exam, sensory exam, gait exam, and reflexes) at each visit compared to baseline from the IDE</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical Improvement in one or more radicular symptoms or myelopathy (Visual Analog Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Endpoint will be examined using the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) which is a straight horizontal line of fixed length (100 millimeters) oriented from the left (best) to the right (worst)</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disc Height</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Months</time_frame>

    <measure>Displacement or Migration of the device</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Displacement or Migration of the device will be compared to baseline from the IDE (changes of &gt;3 mm will be considered significant)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>60 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction will be examined at 60 months. This will be collected via a questionnaire, completed by the subject, that will ask questions regarding overall satisfaction with treatment, relief from symptoms, exercise, and activity levels.</description>
