    <textblock>
      The treatment objective for patients with SVC syndrome secondary to both malignant and benign&#xD;
      etiologies is to reduce the elevated central venous pressures.1 However, the strategies are&#xD;
      contingent upon the underlying disease process. Thus the management of SVC syndrome ranges&#xD;
      from medical or supportive care to surgical bypass,3 and it is important for physicians to&#xD;
      understand the varied treatment modalities of this potentially life-threatening disease.17&#xD;
      Fortunately, the overwhelming majority of patients with SVC syndrome secondary to benign&#xD;
      causes develop a physiologic compensation for the obstruction that can be treated with&#xD;
      anticoagulation and endovascular modalities. Intervention for symptomatic relief may not be&#xD;
      required.1 An endovascular approach is the current standard of care to relieve SVC&#xD;
      obstruction due to malignancy to obtain prompt relief of the rapidly emerging symptoms and&#xD;
      improve quality of life,3 keeping in mind the short life expectancy of these patients. The&#xD;
      role of endovascular therapy in SVC syndrome of nonmalignant etiology is undecided because&#xD;
      the long-term durability of this treatment method remains to be assessed.&#xD;

      This case study will retrospectively review all SVC syndrome and/or occlusion procedures&#xD;
      since January 2009. All patients were given adequate informed consent about the procedure and&#xD;
      its benefits and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitions of clinical outcomes will adhere to the Subcommittee on Reporting Standards in&#xD;
      Venous disease.27 Risk factors and outcomes of these procedures will be retrospectively&#xD;
      analyzed. Data collected included preoperative patient demographics, clinical status,&#xD;
      noninvasive and invasive imaging, operative procedural details, post-operative complications,&#xD;
      post-procedural imaging surveillance, adjunctive/re-intervention procedures, clinical outcome&#xD;
      during follow-up, and mortality. Primary endpoints will be clinical outcome and patency.&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints will be re-intervention rate and death within 30 days.&#xD;

    <description>Endovascular therapy with percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) and, in recent years, with stenting of the SVC, has been performed with increasing frequency. An endovascular approach is the current standard of care to relieve SVC obstruction due to malignancy to obtain prompt relief of the rapidly emerging symptoms and improve quality of life,3 keeping in mind the short life expectancy of these patients. The role of endovascular therapy in SVC syndrome of nonmalignant etiology is undecided because long-term durability of this treatment method remains to be assessed.</description>
