      This project seeks to evaluate the trajectories of suicidal ideation and attempts in&#xD;
      adolescent patients with psychiatric disorders in secondary care controls in the Maule&#xD;
      region, in relation to clinical factors (depressive symptoms, anxiety, stress, psychiatric&#xD;
      comorbidity, mistreatment or abuse, history of psychiatric disorders and pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments); psychological (parenting styles, impulsivity, barriers in seeking help and&#xD;
      emotional regulation), and neuropsychological (executive function-decision making).&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent suicide is a major problem in public health worldwide and due to the&#xD;
      multi-dimensionality of factors involved (biological, genetic, psychiatric, economic,&#xD;
      socio-demographic, family-related and cultural), its study is complex. Within the general&#xD;
      population, the global suicide rate is 10.6 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants (13.5 men&#xD;
      and 7.7 women) and in the Americas it comes up to 9.8 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants&#xD;
      (15.1 men and 4.6 women). In Chile, the suicide rate is 10.6 deaths for every 100,000&#xD;
      inhabitants (17.2 men and 4.0 women) being above average regarding other countries in the&#xD;
      Americas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For adolescents, suicide is the second cause of premature death among people ranging from 15&#xD;
      to 29 and the third for the 15-19 age group. Also, within the group of 10 to 24 there are&#xD;
      more deaths from suicide than traffic accidents, cancer, and cardiac diseases. In Chile, 60%&#xD;
      of deaths among adolescents are caused by external reasons (suicide and homicide). Deaths to&#xD;
      suicide among Chilean adolescents have presented a sustained increase in the last 15 years&#xD;
      (55% between 1999-2005), being the second country within the Organization for Economic&#xD;
      Co-operation and Development (OECD) with the highest percentage variation. In a recent study&#xD;
      which compared the suicide rate among adolescents from 10 to 19 in countries belonging to the&#xD;
      OECD, Chile had the fourth highest suicide rate with 5.36 deaths for every 100,000&#xD;
      inhabitants. When divided into sub-groups, Chile had the highest rates from 10 to 14 in both&#xD;
      men and women with 2.23 deaths for every 100,000 inhabitants; and in the group of 15 to 19&#xD;
      the third highest rates in males and the fourth in females with 15.87 and 6.32 deaths for&#xD;
      every 100,000 inhabitants, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescence is a critical period of vulnerability for the development of suicidal behavior.&#xD;
      During this stage, suicidal behavior shows unstable and fluctuating patterns; ideation&#xD;
      without suicide attempts may appear, subjects can go from ideas to plans and make an attempt,&#xD;
      there are those who try just once while others try repeatedly, and there are others who, in&#xD;
      spite of their vulnerability, do not develop such behavior. Suicide rates vary according to&#xD;
      gender and age, being higher among men than women, while ideation and suicide attempts are&#xD;
      more frequent among women rather than men. It is estimated that for each completed suicide in&#xD;
      young people, there are from 100 to 200 suicide attempts. Also, suicidal thoughts have been&#xD;
      associated to later attempts and their repetition. It is estimated that a third of&#xD;
      adolescents with suicidal thoughts will try during the following year. Evidence shows that&#xD;
      lifetime the suicidal ideation rate is 12.1% in adolescents from 13 to 18; on the other hand,&#xD;
      7.4% of young people from 10 to 24 have reported at least one suicide attempt within the last&#xD;
      12 months with a greater prevalence of attempts among women (9.3%) than men (5.1%). In Chile,&#xD;
      23.7% of adolescents ranging from 13 to 18 presented suicidal ideation and 9% tried in the&#xD;
      last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Chilean Health Ministry [MINSAL in Spanish] projected a rate of 12 deaths for every&#xD;
      100,000 inhabitants for adolescents from 10 to 19 for the year 2020. According to the&#xD;
      sanitary objectives for the 2011-2020 decade, the MINSAL got determined to diminish this&#xD;
      projected rate by 15%. However, in Chile there are still various limitations and challenges&#xD;
      regarding the study of suicidal behavior among adolescent population. Considering the risk of&#xD;
      onset of suicidal thoughts and attempts during adolescence and the variability in their&#xD;
      evolution, it becomes necessary to make an early and timely identification of high-risk&#xD;
      clinical sub-groups. The analysis of both their patterns along a timeframe and the influence&#xD;
      and interaction of specific factors could meet such objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to evaluate the trajectories of suicidal ideation and attempts in&#xD;
      adolescents with psychiatric disorders being treated within the public health system of the&#xD;
      Maule Region, Chile, in relation to clinical, psychological, and neuropsychological factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identify patterns of change in the trajectories of suicidal ideation and attempts based&#xD;
           on the type of psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify clinical, psychological, and neuropsychological factors for suicide ideation&#xD;
           and attempts during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the predictive value of clinical, psychological, and neuropsychological&#xD;
           factors on the course of suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescent psychiatric&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the interaction of clinical, psychological, and neuropsychological factors&#xD;
           and their influence on the course of suicidal ideation and attempts in adolescent&#xD;
           psychiatric patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identify and characterize groups of adolescent patients with psychiatric disorders,&#xD;
           according to the course of ideation and suicide attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Identify and characterize groups of adolescent patients with psychiatric disorders,&#xD;
           according to repetition of suicide attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. A prospective naturalist study of repeated measurements with a single group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Instruments&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Columbia University Rating Scale on the Intensity of Suicidal Ideas (C-SSRS Chile /&#xD;
           Spanish 5.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Barratt Impulsivity Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Emotional Regulation Difficulties Scale (DERS-E)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Depression, Anxiety and Stress abbreviated Scale (DASS-21)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Insomnia Severity Index (ISI)&#xD;

&#xD;
        7. General Help Seeking Questionnaire for mental health problems in adolescents (GHSQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Iowa Gambling Task (IGT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and Application&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of the study will be made along with mental health teams in hospitals,&#xD;
      Community Centers for Mental Health (COSAM) and Family Health Centers (CESFAM) of the Maule&#xD;
      Region. After the study has initiated, a registry will be made of the patients who attend the&#xD;
      Mental Health units during the first 6 months. Patients shall be contacted by a member of the&#xD;
      research team and invited to participate, informing them in written and verbally about the&#xD;
      essential aspects of the research, its objective, benefits, and clinical implications.&#xD;
      Afterwards, their informed consent shall be requested, which must be signed by the mother,&#xD;
      father, or responsible tutor for participants under 18. Selected patients shall be assessed&#xD;
      using the protocol made up by the instruments before mentioned at three moments during the&#xD;
      study: an initial evaluation, then at 6-8 months, and the final evaluation one year after the&#xD;
      second measurement. Medical records will be analyzed to obtain data regarding medical history&#xD;
      (psychiatric and medical diagnose, hospitalization, treatments, among others) and a&#xD;
      socio-demographic questionnaire is to be applied. Also, family-related background is to be&#xD;
      obtained regarding records of mental disease and suicidal behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the research and the follow-up period (24 months), the responsible researcher shall&#xD;
      arrange clinical meetings with the team or professionals (medics or psychologists) of the&#xD;
      adolescents under study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis and expected results&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, different exploratory analysis will be carried out with the goal of obtaining a&#xD;
      first approximation to the data and spot out possible coding errors. Then, analysis shall be&#xD;
      made regarding reliability and validity for each of the instruments constituting the&#xD;
      protocol. Modeling techniques will also be implemented with the objective of analyzing the&#xD;
      information gathered from an explicative and predictive perspective, exploring the adjustment&#xD;
      levels of data in the models being tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, from the latent class analyzes, we will seek to identify change trajectories in&#xD;
      relation to the variables studied, based on the following hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. High levels of suicidal ideation at first measurement, predicts a higher likelihood of&#xD;
           suicide attempts during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Adolescents with suicidal ideation and previous attempts will be more likely to repeat&#xD;
           than those with a single attempt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Adolescents with less emotional regulation, poor parental styles, high levels of&#xD;
           impulsivity and a history of self-harm have an irregular course of suicidal thoughts and&#xD;
           ask for less help in dealing with their problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adolescents with a history of previous suicide attempts, psychiatric comorbidity, and&#xD;
           impaired decision-making ability, have a greater severity of suicidal ideas and more&#xD;
           likely to repeat a suicide attempt than those without these characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical review&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research project was approved by the Ethics Committee of the Maule Health Service and by&#xD;
      the Scientific Ethics Committee of the Universidad Católica del Maule de Chile, meeting&#xD;
      principles established by the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international&#xD;
      regulations of the Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences (CIOMS) and&#xD;
      Law 20.120 regarding scientific research involving human beings in Chile. Also, the authors&#xD;
      declare that necessary ethical safeguards have been adopted for working with people, as&#xD;
      proposed in the Helsinki declaration and the Belmont report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescent suicide is the consequence of a complex interaction among genetic, biological,&#xD;
      psychiatric, psychological, social, and cultural factors. Though there is consensus regarding&#xD;
      the importance of elaborating more effective interventions for reducing suicide risk among&#xD;
      adolescents, there still are many limitations and challenges in the detection and early and&#xD;
      timely prevention of suicidal thoughts and attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A review of the existing evidence have pointed out that models proposed in the last 50 years&#xD;
      present a low predictive capacity and that risk factor categories have become homogeneous,&#xD;
      being incapable of identifying specific groups of variables associated to the different types&#xD;
      of suicidal behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, it is paradoxical that about 82% of scientific production comes from North&#xD;
      America and Europe, considering that countries such as China and India account for almost&#xD;
      half of suicides worldwide, and given the sustained increase in suicide rates in Latin&#xD;
      America, where several countries exceed the European average. It is necessary to promote more&#xD;
      studies in these territories and identify cultural and local variables that can improve the&#xD;
      understanding of this public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the risk of onset of ideation and suicidal attempts during adolescence and the&#xD;
      variability in their evolution, it becomes necessary to early and timely identify vulnerable&#xD;
      groups by means of different methodological approaches. This way, their study requires&#xD;
      methodological approaches that allow overcoming detected weaknesses, through specific&#xD;
      explicative models which enable a more in-depth comprehension of their development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The methodology proposed for this study will seek to overcome the limitations of&#xD;
      cross-sectional and retrospective studies by identifying patterns of suicidal thoughts and&#xD;
      behaviors for a specified period and of the influence and interactions of specific variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, though the number of total questions of the protocol may seem high, the&#xD;
      selected questionnaires present a form of short answers which are easy to comprehend. Also,&#xD;
      each questionnaire will be applied by a trained research assistant (psychologist) and each&#xD;
      question shall be read to the adolescent to ensure understanding and quality of the answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the use of protocols in clinical practice has been questioned due to their low&#xD;
      predictive capacity, their use can improve efficiency and consistency in decision making,&#xD;
      allowing the elaboration of an individualized treatment plan and a better risk management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, deaths by self-inflicted injuries are irregularly distributed around the world, 79%&#xD;
      of suicides occur in low and mid income countries but, in spite of the importance of&#xD;
      considering these regional variations and the differentiation of risk factors according to&#xD;
      the context, most researches take place in high income countries (Europe and North America)&#xD;
      where the risk of suicide is lower.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study also seeks to overcome this weakness so as to allow comparing and identifying&#xD;
      differentiating aspects of suicidal behavior in adolescents, which will contribute to improve&#xD;
      the understanding of this problem and to elaborate interventions focused on sub-clinical&#xD;
      groups with higher risk, also considering cultural and local variables.&#xD;
