    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The SGRQ is a self-administered questionnaire that has been validated in participants with airways disease, specifically in participants with bronchiectasis. The SGRQ assesses health-related quality of life in participants with chronic pulmonary disease by evaluating 3 health domains: symptoms (distress caused by respiratory symptoms); activity (effects of disturbances on mobility and physical activity); and impacts (the effect of disease on factors such as employment, personal control of one's health, and need for medication). A composite total score is derived as the sum of domain scores for symptoms, activity, and impact (0 = best possible score and 100 = worst possible score).</description>

    <description>The SGRQ is a self-administered questionnaire that has been validated in participants with airways disease, specifically in participants with bronchiectasis. The SGRQ assesses health-related quality of life in participants with chronic pulmonary disease by evaluating 3 health domains: symptoms (distress caused by respiratory symptoms); activity (effects of disturbances on mobility and physical activity); and impacts (the effect of disease on factors such as employment, personal control of one's health, and need for medication). A composite total score is derived as the sum of domain scores for symptoms, activity, and impact (0 = best possible score and 100 = worst possible score). A within patient reduction from baseline in score of 4 units is generally recognized as a clinically meaningful improvement in quality of life.</description>

An AE does not necessarily have a causal relationship with the study intervention. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product, whether or not related to that medicinal (investigational or non-investigational) product.</description>
