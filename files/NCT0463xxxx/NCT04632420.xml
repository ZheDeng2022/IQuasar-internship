  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Headache and backache are common symptoms following childbirth. The incidence of these&#xD;
      symptoms have been shown to increase during the postpartum period between 5 to 12 months&#xD;
      following delivery. By 12 months postpartum up to 45% and 65% of women experience headache&#xD;
      and backache, respectively. While studies have reported headache and backache as frequently&#xD;
      persistent symptoms beyond the first year postpartum, few studies have specifically&#xD;
      interrogated women seeking specialist pain physician input or identified predisposing risk&#xD;
      factors. Finally there is little known about typically described pain characteristics of&#xD;
      women who suffer with chronic postpartum headache and backache. We aim to compare the&#xD;
      prevalence of chronic headache in women that have versus have not experienced childbirth.&#xD;
