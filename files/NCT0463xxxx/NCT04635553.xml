  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this project is to examine and quantify the potential existence and&#xD;
      impact on Praziquantel (PZQ) efficacy, of naturally occurring S. haematobium and S. bovis&#xD;
      hybrid populations in northern Senegal. Schistosome hybrids may present vigor compared to&#xD;
      their pure parental forms and hence, may be less sensitive to PZQ. We hypothesise that PZQ&#xD;
      repeated treatment selects the hybrid schistosome populations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Human schistosomiasis is a Neglected Tropical Disease caused by schistosome helminth worms&#xD;
      with impressive epidemiological statistics associated: 800 million people at risk in 78&#xD;
      countries, &gt; 230 million infected and &gt; 200 000 deaths each year. The disease is highly&#xD;
      endemic in sub-Saharan Africa where it persists despite mass drug administration with&#xD;
      Praziquantel (PZQ). Some schistosomes are specific to humans and induce two main disease&#xD;
      forms (either mesenteric or uro-genital) while others are associated with wild animals.&#xD;
      However, hybridization can occur between different schistosome species. In northern Senegal,&#xD;
      hybridization between schistosome species specific to humans and animals is now known to be&#xD;
      frequent with the potential risk of zoonotic transmission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will propose an integrative approach by conducting parasitological and molecular&#xD;
      analysis including, schistosome miracidia genotyping to show if PZQ repeated treatment&#xD;
      affects the genomic composition (Frequencies of alleles) of hybrid populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the current prevalence of potential hybrid schistosome populations in their&#xD;
           natural setting in Senegal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the sensitivity of hybrid schistosomes to praziquantel treatment in field&#xD;
           populations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the molecular basis (at the genome level) of such phenotypic changes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a longitudinal observation of a cohort of school children after repeated&#xD;
      Praziquantel (40 mg/kg) treatment, a drug commonly used through Mass Drug Administration&#xD;
      (MDA) to treat schistosomiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cohort will be followed over a period of three years. Before the followup, a baseline&#xD;
      urogenital schistosomiasis test will be performed on 1, 450 school-age children randomly&#xD;
      selected in the five sites (290 in each site). All positive children will receive a single&#xD;
      treatment (T1) of Praziquantel (PZQ) (40 mg/kg). Among those who test positive for S.&#xD;
      haematobium eggs, only 50 in each site (five sites), who meet all the eligibility criteria&#xD;
      will be invited to participate to the longitudinal follow-up. Four rounds of a single&#xD;
      praziquantel (PZQ) treatment will be administered to positive individuals every 6 months. One&#xD;
      round will consist of one treatment (T1 to T4) followed by a control treatment after one&#xD;
      month (CT1 to CT4), hence, before the potential re-infecting schistosomes become adults and&#xD;
      start egg-laying, which could bias the effectiveness of treatment evaluations. At each CT&#xD;
      time, samples will be collected and S. haematobium eggs quantified (number of excreted&#xD;
      eggs/10 mls of urine). Parasites (miracidia hatched from excreted eggs) will be recovered&#xD;
      before each initial treatment (T1 to T4) and at CT1 to CT4 for subsequent genetic analysis to&#xD;
      characterize hybrid schistosomes between S. haematobium and S. bovis.&#xD;
