  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the use of locally injected tranexamic acid (TXA)&#xD;
      under the skin during Mohs micrographic surgery for removal of skin cancers in patients on&#xD;
      anticoagulation. TXA may be helpful in reducing bleeding and pain during surgery, and may&#xD;
      also lead to fewer post-operative complications following surgery such as graft loss,&#xD;
      specifically in patients on blood-thinners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous infiltration&#xD;
      of tranexamic acid (TXA) in the reduction of peri- and post-operative complications including&#xD;
      bleeding, infections, flap and graft loss in anticoagulated patients undergoing Mohs&#xD;
      micrographic surgery. A secondary objective is to evaluate the ability of TXA to increase the&#xD;
      pH of lidocaine with epinephrine, and whether it causes less pain than the alternative during&#xD;
      injection of local anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TXA may serve as an effective local antifibrinolytic agent to decrease perioperative and&#xD;
      postoperative bleeding while also causing less injection pain in patients undergoing Mohs&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TXA is a well-established antifibrinolytic agent used in many surgical fields to effectively&#xD;
      reduce post-operative bleeding. TXA is a synthetic lysine analogue that prevents the lysis of&#xD;
      polymerized fibrin in blood clots. It has been used intravenously, orally, and subcutaneously&#xD;
      to reduce bleeding during orthopedic procedures, to manage postpartum bleeding, and in trauma&#xD;
      patients to control significant hemorrhage. It has also been used intravenously to reduce the&#xD;
      need for blood transfusions in cardiac and liver transplantation.The safety of TXA has been&#xD;
      verified in numerous publications across multiple medical specialties. Additionally, the pH&#xD;
      of TXA ranges from 6-8, indicating that it may serve as an effective buffering agent and&#xD;
      cause less pain with injection of anesthetic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many institutions have begun to use tranexamic acid to reduce postoperative bleeding. The&#xD;
      medication is now readily available in the Pyxis of the investigators. The use of TXA within&#xD;
      the wound bed and underlying undermined edges of flaps performed in patients who are&#xD;
      anticoagulated is becoming the standard of care. Anecdotally, this has been quite successful&#xD;
      in reducing post operative bruising and post operative bleeding requiring an emergency visit.&#xD;
      In this protocol, the study arm involving the use of TXA and the study arm without the use of&#xD;
      TXA are currently standard of care and are currently routinely used intraoperatively in&#xD;
      clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are performing this study to examine the efficacy of TXA as a safe, local&#xD;
      antifibrinolytic agent in dermatologic surgeries and will analyze postoperative bleeding as&#xD;
      well as other postoperative complications.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Once a participant has provided informed consent to participate in the study, he/she will be randomly assigned to either the TXA experimental group or the control group. A randomized list will be created prior to the start of the study with the help of a biostatistician. The provider will be aware of which study arm the participant is in, however the participant will be blinded.</intervention_model_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Postoperative Complications</measure>
    <time_frame>From day of surgery to 12 weeks post-operation</time_frame>
    <description>Primary outcome measures will be the number of postoperative complications, including infection, bleeding (necessitating phone calls to providers or additional clinic visits), hematoma formation, and flap or graft failure.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Hemostasis</measure>
    <time_frame>during surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The quality of intraoperative hemostasis will be measured on a 1-4 scale titled &quot;Quality of the Field&quot;, with 1 being &quot;excellent, better than expected/predicted for this procedure&quot; and 4 being &quot;poor, oozing that required adding gauze dressing and local pressure&quot; (the higher the score, the worse the outcome)</description>

    <measure>Injection Pain</measure>
    <time_frame>30 minutes post initial injection</time_frame>
    <description>Injection pain will be measured via self reported pain intensity within the first 30 minutes of initial injection on the day of surgery. The pain scale is scored 0-10 (0 = no pain; 10 = unable to move). The higher the score, the worse the outcome.</description>
