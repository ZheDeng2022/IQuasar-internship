  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Yearly 15 million babies worldwide are born too soon. 10% of these preterm births occur very&#xD;
      early before 32 weeks of gestation and these newborns are at high risk for neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      disorders later in life. Neurocognitive disorders now touch 27% of the European population,&#xD;
      and 5% or 3.3 million children suffer from social and learning difficulties, including&#xD;
      attention-deficit hyperactivity disorders and autism, whose rates are increasing and&#xD;
      prematurity contributes to this rise. Cognition, and socio-emotional competence are based on&#xD;
      intact brain structure and functions that are formed early in development, both pre- and&#xD;
      post-natally, and are heavily influenced by environment. Ramon y Cajal in his studies on the&#xD;
      making of the brain clearly stated: &quot;The total arborisation of a neuron represents the&#xD;
      graphic history of conflicts suffered during its developmental life&quot;. Understanding how&#xD;
      environment affects early brain development and defining timing and mode of early&#xD;
      interventions to enhance brain development in high risk populations, such as preterm infants,&#xD;
      is currently acknowledged as a fundamental endeavor for the scientific community (see&#xD;
      guidelines of the National Scientific Council for the Developing Child). Interventions to&#xD;
      improve and maintain cognitive and socio-emotional skills are to become an essential tool of&#xD;
      medical care for high-risk infants. The goal of this study is to test the impact of a&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based intervention - considered to target brain networks previously described as&#xD;
      affected by prematurity and improve socio-emotional and executive functions. Mindfulness&#xD;
      based intervention (intentional self-regulation of attention) will be performed in 10-13 year&#xD;
      old preterm children, both from our prior studied preterm cohorts. Overall, our planned&#xD;
      research will fill an important gap in our theoretical understanding of the brain&#xD;
      vulnerability linked to prematurity. Even more importantly, the compelling issue of how to&#xD;
      build cognitive and emotional resilience in preterm children will be addressed by preventing&#xD;
      the onset of difficulties and reducing them with appropriate interventions.&#xD;

Participants enrolled in the RCT completed three assessments at three different time points: Time 1, Time 2, Time 3.

    <description>Executive competences of young adolescents were assessed using the Behaviour Rating Inventory of Executive Function - parent questionnaire version (BRIEF) evaluating attention, hyperactivity and impulsivity in everyday life. The BRIEF comprises 86 items over two standardised subscales, the Behavioural Regulation Index (BRI) and the Metacognition Index (MI), as well as a global score called the Global Executive Composite (GEC). These 3 scores will be used as a measure of executive function in daily life. Higher scores mean worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>The affect recognition subtest assesses the ability to recognise facial emotional expressions (happy, sad, anger, fear, disgust, and neutral) from photographs of children's faces in several matching tasks. In the first task, the participant selected one of the four faces that depicted the same emotion as a child's face at the top of the page. In a second task, the participant selected two photographs of faces that displayed the same affect from a selection of four photographs. Finally, the participant examined a photograph of a child's face for 5 seconds, and then from memory, selected two photographs that matched the same emotion as the face previously shown. Standardised scores will be used. Higher scores mean better outcomes.</description>

    <description>The Flanker Visual Filtering Task was used to assess attentional control and information processing speed. Each trial showed a horizontal row of five fish. The participant was asked to respond as quickly as possible to whether the central fish was facing to the left or right. Congruent trials were the ones with all five fish in the horizontal row pointing in the same direction and incongruent trials were the ones with the four distracting fishes pointing in the opposite direction of the central target fish. Reaction time of the congruent condition and of the incongruent condition were used to assess information processing speed, and the inhibition score (reaction time in incongruent conditions - reaction time in congruent conditions) was used as a measure of attentional control. Higher scores (reaction time) mean worse outcomes.</description>

    <description>Mindfulness-based intervention: The proposed MBI was designed based on well-known MBI programs including Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction and Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy and adapted to adolescents' needs and language. The program consisted of 8 weekly sessions in groups of up to 8 participants, lasting 1h30. Two MBI groups were offered per week (Wednesdays and Fridays) and participants had the possibility to choose the most convenient day for them. Two instructors were present for each group throughout the intervention.For each session one theme was addressed, such as attention and the stabilisation of the focus of attention, bodily sensations, breath, emotions, thoughts, compassion, stress, stress reactivity and coping strategies.</description>
