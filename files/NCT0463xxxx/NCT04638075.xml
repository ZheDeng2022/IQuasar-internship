  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the SNS to bottle feeding. This study will&#xD;
      compare exclusive breastfeeding rates and breast milk feeding rates at discharge, day of life&#xD;
      14, and day of life 28 between neonates hospitalized in the NICU for hyperbilirubinemia&#xD;
      between those who receive supplementation by the (SNS) or those who receive supplementation&#xD;
      by bottle. Additionally, this study will evaluate mothers' experiences while using the SNS.&#xD;
      We hypothesize mothers who utilize the SNS will have higher rates of breast milk feeding&#xD;
      compared to mothers who supplement by bottle.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Supplemental feedings in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) are common due to the&#xD;
      separation of mother and neonate and/or complex medical issues that make direct breastfeeding&#xD;
      difficult. The Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) is utilized infrequently in the NICU and&#xD;
      there is little data available to compare breastfeeding outcomes of mothers who supplement by&#xD;
      bottle compared to SNS. The aims of this study are to understand whether supplementation by&#xD;
      SNS improves breastfeeding outcomes compared to neonates supplemented by bottle. From&#xD;
      December 1, 2018 - November 30, 2019 there were 195 neonates admitted to Children's Hospital&#xD;
      Colorado (CHCO) with a primary diagnosis of hyperbilirubinemia who were born at 37 weeks or&#xD;
      greater. This makes up approximately 13.7% of all admissions during that time frame. This is&#xD;
      a population of mothers at risk for cessation of exclusive breastfeeding due to the necessity&#xD;
      of supplementation. These neonates are frequently supplemented because the mother's milk&#xD;
      typically is not yet in to support adequate nutritional intake. These neonates are not often&#xD;
      medically complex or have any factors that would bias the results of this study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a randomized controlled trial comparing the SNS to bottle feeding. Once eligibility is determined and consent is obtained, the Primary Investigator (PI)/ Co-Investigator (CI) will randomize the mother-neonate dyad to either bottle supplemental feedings (group A) or SNS supplemental feedings (group B). Randomization will be done by using a computer-generated table of random numbers. Breast milk feeding and exclusive breastfeeding rates will be compared between both groups during the last 24 hours of hospitalization, at day of life 14 and at day of life 28.</intervention_model_description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Group A Bottle Supplementation</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>No Intervention</arm_group_type>
    <description>Group A will supplement using the bottle. The mother will breastfeed as frequently as the neonate's physician allows. When the physician recommends supplementation, the mother will supplement using the bottle per standard of care. The mother will breastfeed for up to 25 minutes and then will offer a bottle to supplement breastfeeding for at least 5 minutes. Time at the breast and with the bottle might vary based on the neonate's ability to stay awake at the breast and to sustain a latch at the breast. The type of supplementation will be either Expressed Breast Milk (EBM), Donor Human Milk (DHM), formula, or a combination of EBM and formula or EBM and DHM. The volume of supplementation and duration of bottle use will be determined by the neonate's physician. The mother will return the neonate to their crib then pump and hand express after feeding sessions per the IBCLC's recommendation. The mother will document each feeding session in the feeding log provided at the bedside.</description>

    <description>Group B will supplement using the SNS. The mother will breastfeed as frequently as the neonate's physician allows. When the physician recommends supplementation, the mother will supplement using the SNS per standard of care. The mother will assemble the SNS, place it clamped and in position at the nipple prior to breastfeeding (see SNS instructions for use). The mother will initiate breastfeeding for up to 5 minutes and then unclamp the SNS to begin supplementation for up to 25 minutes. The SNS will contain either EBM, DHM, formula, or a combination of EBM and formula or EBM and DHM. The volume of supplementation and duration of SNS use will be determined by the neonate's physician. The mother will pump and hand express after feeding sessions per the IBCLC's recommendation. Them mother will document each feeding session in the feeding log provided at the bedside.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Supplemental Nursing System</intervention_name>
    <description>The SNS is a device designed to deliver supplemental milk by suckling at the mother's nipple. A specially designed bottle attaches to the mother's breast and serves as the reservoir for milk. Attached to the bottle is a small tube which runs down to and is placed on the tip of the mother's nipple. With an adequate latch the neonate obtains supplementation by suckling. Additionally, this suckling stimulates milk production (Lawrence &amp; Lawrence, 2016).</description>
