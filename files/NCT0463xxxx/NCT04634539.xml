  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll a total of 16 patients with advanced pancreatic cancer at Cedars-Sinai&#xD;
      Medical Center. All subjects will receive combination therapy of gemcitabine, nab-paclitaxel,&#xD;
      and L-glutamine. The study investigates what the appropriate dosage of L-glutamine is so that&#xD;
      there is the lowest risk of side effects, and whether the supplement will make standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel more effective in treating advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

    <description>For the dose-finding portion of this study, all subjects will receive a combination of L-glutamine, gemcitabine, and nab-paclitaxel which will be preceded by a 1-week (+/- 1 day) administration of L-glutamine. This 1-week administration of L-glutamine will facilitate measurement of baseline and post-glutamine monotherapy plasma metabolite levels prior to addition of gemcitabine and nab-paclitaxel. The combination therapy will be administered over 28-day cycles during the treatment period until disease progression, treatment intolerance, or withdrawal from the study. Patients are expected to be on treatment for 12 cycles.</description>
