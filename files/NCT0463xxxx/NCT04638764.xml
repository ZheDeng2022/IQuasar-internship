  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study coronary artery disease patients and patients with heart failure will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to three training groups: combined aerobic interval training with high&#xD;
      intensity resistance training, combined aerobic interval training with low intensity&#xD;
      resistance training and aerobic interval training.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise-based cardiac rehabilitation programmes have predominantly used aerobic-dynamic&#xD;
      exercise modalities, whereas resistance training have been discouraged in patients with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, due to safety concerns related to cardiovascular response (heart rate&#xD;
      and blood pressure) during the exertion. Contrary to such concerns, recent hemodynamic&#xD;
      studies have reported lower blood pressure and heart rate during higher intensity resistance&#xD;
      training (&gt;70 % 1-RM) compared to lower intensity resistance training (&gt;40 % 1-RM).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the latest meta analysis have demonstrated that combined resistance training&#xD;
      with standard aerobic interval training has been superior than aerobic training alone in&#xD;
      several aspects of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is still huge heterogeneity in training intervention design, also there still&#xD;
      lacks studies to further elucidate the effects of high intensity resistance training combined&#xD;
      with aerobic training on physical performance (aerobic capacity, muscle strength, balance),&#xD;
      body composition, quality of life, morbidity, mortality, etc. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      study was to examine the effects of high (70%-80 % 1-RM) versus low loads (30%- 40 % 1-RM)&#xD;
      resistance training in combination with aerobic interval cycling (50 % -80% of baseline peak&#xD;
      Power output) in coronary artery disease patients and patients with heart failure.&#xD;
