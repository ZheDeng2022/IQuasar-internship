  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is an irregular heart rhythm associated with significant morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Catheter ablation is an established treatment where catheters are inserted&#xD;
      through a vein in the leg into the left atrium of the heart to deliver lines of scar to&#xD;
      disrupt the tissue causing and maintaining AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ECG-I is a system which involves wearing a jacket with many ECG electrodes to record&#xD;
      electrical activity from the surface of the body. A CT scan then shows where these electrodes&#xD;
      are relative to the atria, and computer modelling is used to reconstruct the movements of&#xD;
      electricity on the surface of the heart and therefore identifying where the drivers (tissue&#xD;
      causing and maintaining AF) are located.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Success rates for persistent atrial fibrillation lie in the region of 30-60% due to the&#xD;
      location of drivers (tissue causing and maintaining AF) varying per patient. Locating and&#xD;
      treating these drivers is very challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to enrol 40 patients with persistent AF and perform atrial mapping using the ECG-I&#xD;
      system. We will perform pulmonary vein isolation and perform atrial mapping to identify the&#xD;
      location of these drivers and then to ablate them. We will study the effects of performing&#xD;
      ablation upon these drivers using the ECG-I.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atrial Fibrillation (AF) is the commonest heart rhythm disturbance and is associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity and mortality. Catheter ablation (CA) is a procedure where catheters&#xD;
      (leads) are passed into the heart and energy is used to disrupt and isolate (by freezing or&#xD;
      cauterising) heart tissue causing AF. CA is an established therapy for AF. Success rates for&#xD;
      CA for paroxysmal AF lies in the region of 70% or better. However, success rates for&#xD;
      persistent AF is much lower and estimates lie in the region of 30-60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current CA protocols for AF centre on isolating the pulmonary veins (the pulmonary veins&#xD;
      drain into the left atrium) which have been proven to trigger AF. Pulmonary Vein Isolation&#xD;
      (PVI) ablation alone seems sufficient to remove the trigger for the vast majority of patients&#xD;
      with paroxysmal AF. However, in patients with persistent AF it is common for AF to continue&#xD;
      after the pulmonary veins have been electrically isolated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The difference in success rates between the paroxysmal and persistent form of AF is thought&#xD;
      to be due to changes within the heart atria after AF has been established for some time. In&#xD;
      persistent AF the atria dilate and remodel structurally and electrically, and therefore the&#xD;
      maintenance of persistent AF differs from paroxysmal AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Persistent AF is thought to be maintained by focal sources, whether rotors or sites of radial&#xD;
      activation. Currently, targeting other sites within the atria in addition to PVI such as&#xD;
      fractionated electrograms (areas of electrical activity) are thought to be imprecise and&#xD;
      require extensive ablation. Often AF will persist despite targeting additional sites within&#xD;
      the atria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently clinical characteristics of patients or structural imaging have limited accuracy in&#xD;
      selecting patients likely to benefit from CA. Mapping studies have shown that patients with&#xD;
      persistent AF who have higher frequency signals near the pulmonary veins than being&#xD;
      distributed in the left atrial body are more likely to terminate to sinus rhythm (normal&#xD;
      heart rhythm) with PVI alone and to maintain sinus rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have suggested that patients undergoing standard PVI ablation procedures for&#xD;
      persistent AF who have coincidental interruption of drivers have a far better long term&#xD;
      outcome. This suggests that the characteristics of atrial heart tissue and electrical&#xD;
      activation patterns maintaining AF are likely to determine the response to ablation therefore&#xD;
      it may be possible to determine more directly and accurately the likelihood of success by&#xD;
      performing non-invasive mapping of the atria using the ECG-I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ECG-I is able to localise the drivers of AF and one of the objectives is to study the&#xD;
      electrical characteristics of the tissue. ECG-I is currently being used in research into AF.&#xD;
      A recently published a study using ECG-I to identify targets of ablation in 103 patients.&#xD;
      They suggested that using ECG-I may improve CA success rates and reduces the procedure time&#xD;
      and amount of ablation. The prospective multicentre AFACART study had similar findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to enrol 40 patients who will undergo Atrial Mapping with ECG-I during catheter&#xD;
      ablation. After isolation of the pulmonary veins patients drivers will be targeted guided by&#xD;
      the system.&#xD;
