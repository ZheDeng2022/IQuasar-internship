      The main objective of this study is to analyse the effect of KT on countermovement jump (CMJ)&#xD;
      and sprint immediately and 24 hours after its application on the quadriceps and gluteus&#xD;
      maximus.&#xD;

      Kinesiotape (KT) is a technique commonly used in sports practice. It may be beneficial in&#xD;
      enhancing muscle function by additional cutaneous afferent stimulation. The objective of this&#xD;
      study was to analyze the effect of KT on countermovement jump (CMJ) and 20-m sprints&#xD;
      immediately and 24 hours after its application on the quadriceps and gluteus maximus. A total&#xD;
      of 37 male soccer players (19.7 ± 0.9 years old) were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups:&#xD;
      experimental group: KT activation (KTact), placebo group: sham tape (KTst), and control group&#xD;
      (CG). Participants performed a 30-minute preliminary warm-up, after which they conducted CMJ&#xD;
      and 20-m sprint tests. These tests were repeated later (with KT application or not) and after&#xD;
      24 hours.&#xD;

    <description>With regard to the Kinesiotape technique, 2 I-shaped tapes were placed at the quadriceps, following the same direction of the muscle fibres and with no tension. At the gluteus, 2 I-shaped tapes were applied following the same direction of the muscle fibres and with no tension.</description>

    <description>In rectus femoris, origin was under the anterosuperior iliac spines, and taping finished with a Y-shape pattern under the patella. After that, an I-shaped KT was applied over vastus medialis and vastus lateralis muscles in both quadriceps. Finally, subjects were taped with a Y-shaped KT at the gluteus maximus muscles. Tape tension was between 25% and 50%.</description>
