  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Focal repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) has been applied to improve&#xD;
      symptoms in Parkinson disease (PD) with conflicting results. However, the stimulation with&#xD;
      H-coil has been shown to stimulate a wider cortical area compared with the standard coils,&#xD;
      with preliminary results confirming the potential efficacy of the treatment. In this study&#xD;
      the investigators aimed to explore the safety and efficacy of excitatory rTMS with H-coil on&#xD;
      PD motor symptoms.&#xD;

      This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled study, with a 1:1:1 randomization into three&#xD;
      groups: group 1 - real rTMS over primary motor cortex and prefrontal cortex (M1-PFC): group 2&#xD;
      - real rTMS over M1 and sham rTMS over PFC; group 3 - sham stimulation over both targets&#xD;
