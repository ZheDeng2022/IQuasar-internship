&#xD;
          5. Subjects able to produce a peak inspiratory flow rate of at least 30.00L/min at&#xD;
             screening using the investigational device attached to an electronic flow meter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have smoked within 12 months before admission cannot be entered the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;

             forced expiratory volume in 1 second (%FEV1) ≥ 80% and forced expiratory volume in 1&#xD;
             second (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) ratio ≥70%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Male subjects are eligible to participate if they agree to the following during the&#xD;
