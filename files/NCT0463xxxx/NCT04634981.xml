  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal anesthesia (SA) has become the standard technique in elective cesarean section (CS) as&#xD;
      it results in less maternal and neonatal morbidity than general anesthesia (GA) (Grade-A&#xD;
      recommendation, NICE). For women requiring emergency CS, rapid sequence general anesthesia&#xD;
      (RSGA) is commonly used because this technique is faster to perform than SA. Though several&#xD;
      randomized trials have compared the maternal and fetal outcome between these two anesthetic&#xD;
      techniques, the studies with respect to category 1 CS (emergent conditions that hold&#xD;
      immediate threat to life of the woman or fetus) are limited.&#xD;

      Full term pregnant females will be included in this study. They will be allocated into two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Group G): will receive rapid sequence general anesthesia, and (Group S): will receive spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia. After preoperative assessment and investigations by the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist, the decision of the anesthetic approach will be decided by the attending&#xD;
      anesthesiologist according to indications for CS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before induction of anesthesia intravenous (IV) ranitidine 50 mg will be administered after&#xD;
      establishing an IV access. On the operating table, vital signs will be monitored for all&#xD;
      parturients throughout the surgery according to the standard departmental protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      fetal well being will be assessed after delivery by using 1 minute and 5 min APGAR score and&#xD;
      umbilical cord PH . in addition to maternal vital signs intra-operative then follow up any&#xD;
      complications that may occur to the mother post-operative.&#xD;

In the meantime, the spinal anesthetic drug and local anesthetic drug will be prepared. After wiping povidone iodine with alcohol, a rapid single shot of 2.5 ml of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine will be administered intrathecally using 22 G spinal needle. Oxygen will be administered using simple face mask till the delivery of the baby.</description>
