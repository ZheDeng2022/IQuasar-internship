  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial seeks to find out the best dose, possible benefits and/or side effects of&#xD;
      entinostat in combination with atezolizumab, carboplatin and etoposide for the treatment of&#xD;
      previously untreated aggressive lung cancer that has spread (extensive-stage small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer). Entinostat and etoposide may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      atezolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the&#xD;
      ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Carboplatin is a chemotherapy drug that attaches&#xD;
      to deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and may kill tumor cells. Giving entinostat in combination&#xD;
      with atezolizumab, carboplatin and etoposide may work better than atezolizumab, carboplatin&#xD;
      and etoposide alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of entinostat in combination with&#xD;
      carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine safety and tolerability of adding entinostat to carboplatin / etoposide /&#xD;
      atezolizumab for extensive-stage small cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the feasibility of administering entinostat concomitantly with&#xD;
      atezolizumab, carboplatin, and etoposide as determined by the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      receive 3 or more cycles of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To observe and record anti-tumor activity. II. To determine the proportion of patients who&#xD;
      are alive and without disease progression at 9 months (9 month progression free survival&#xD;
      [PFS]) after starting entinostat, carboplatin, etoposide, and atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the clinical activity of entinostat plus carboplatin/etoposide/atezolizumab as&#xD;
      determined by response rate (RR), progression free survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore the prevalence of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) response element&#xD;
      binding protein (CREB) binding protein (CREBBP)/ histone acetyltransferase p300 (EP300)&#xD;
      mutations in newly diagnosed ES-SCLC population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore the relationship between CREBBP/EP300 mutations and clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore immune biomarkers that may predict response to atezolizumab and entinostat and&#xD;
      changes in these biomarkers over the course of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore entinostat exposure-response relationships with toxicity and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (PFS and OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate baseline atezolizumab clearance as an early biomarker for OS and to assess&#xD;
      the relationship between atezolizumab time-varying clearance, cachexia and clinical outcomes&#xD;
      (PFS and OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of entinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 30-60 minutes on day&#xD;
      1, etoposide IV over 60 minutes on days 1-3, atezolizumab IV over 30-60 minutes on day 1, and&#xD;
      entinostat orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 4&#xD;
      cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive atezolizumab IV over 30 minutes on day 1 and entinostat&#xD;
      PO on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 13 cycles in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      2 years, then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;

             eligible if they have an undetectable HCV viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a prior or concurrent malignancy whose natural history or treatment does&#xD;
             not have the potential to interfere with the safety or efficacy assessment of the&#xD;

             eligible for this trial, patients should be class II or better&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of entinostat on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason&#xD;
             and because histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) agents as well as other therapeutic&#xD;
             agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method&#xD;
             of birth control; abstinence) prior to study entry, for the duration of study&#xD;
             participation, up to 5 months after the last dose of study treatment. Should a woman&#xD;
             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating&#xD;
             in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or&#xD;
             enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the&#xD;
             study, for the duration of study participation, and 5 months after completion of study&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
             Participants with impaired decision-making capacity (IDMC) who have a&#xD;
             legally-authorized representative (LAR) and/or family member available will also be&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with evidence of leptomeningeal metastases (either by imaging or central&#xD;
             nervous system [CNS] fluid findings)&#xD;

             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because entinostat is HDACi agent with the&#xD;
             potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects and because of known teratogenic&#xD;
             and abortifacient effects of cisplatin and etoposide. Because there is an unknown but&#xD;
             potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with entinostat, and known risks with cisplatin and etoposide, breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with entinostat. These potential risks&#xD;
             may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;

             adrenal insufficiency permitted)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with anti-PD-1, or anti-PD-L1 therapeutic antibody or&#xD;
             pathway-targeting agents.&#xD;

             bisphosphonate therapy for other reasons (e.g., bone metastasis or osteoporosis) is&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring treatment with a receptor activator of nuclear factor kappa-Β&#xD;

             discontinue it before treatment with etoposide&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Because the list of these agents are constantly changing, it is important to&#xD;
                  regularly consult a frequently updated list such as Facts and Comparisons or&#xD;
                  Lexicompt; medical reference texts such as the Physicians' Desk Reference may&#xD;
                  also provide this information&#xD;
