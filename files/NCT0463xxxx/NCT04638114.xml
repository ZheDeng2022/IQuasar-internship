  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Femoroacetabular impingement (FAI) is increasingly recognized as a common hip condition&#xD;
      affecting the adolescent and adult population with groin pain and disability 1-5. When&#xD;
      nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications, activity modification and injections fail as&#xD;
      conservative treatment option fails, surgery addressing the underlying osseous pathoanatomy&#xD;
      and associated labral and chondral lesions may be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several techniques have been described as treatment of this condition. The first technique&#xD;
      termed surgical hip dislocation (SHD) allowed to describe the pathomechanism of FAI 1, 3, 5,&#xD;
      6 and to develop treatment strategies such as osteochondroplasty, acetabular rim resection&#xD;
      and fixation of torn labrum. Other techniques also have been proposed and consist of less&#xD;
      invasive techniques as the (mini-open) direct anterior approach 7-10 and ´the golden&#xD;
      standard´; the hip arthroscopy 11-15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good results have been reported for all techniques but faster rehabilitation and less&#xD;
      morbidity have been published for hip arthroscopy (HA). The direct anterior approach also&#xD;
      shows good results but a good randomized controlled trial to compare both techniques has not&#xD;
      yet been performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome is meanly determined by adequate bony correction of cam and pincer deformities.&#xD;
      Direct visualization during SHD offers the advantage that possibly a more appropriate&#xD;
      correction of the underlying morphology can be done. This thereby decreases the likelihood of&#xD;
      early hip osteoarthritis (OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study was to test the hypothesis that 1) the postoperative&#xD;
      recovery and short term outcome after HA is superior compared to mini-open direct anterior&#xD;
      approach and 2) the morphological corrections achieved by HA are equally sufficient when&#xD;
      compared to the corrections achieved by the mini-open direct anterior technique.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hip arthroscopy versus mini-open direct anterior approach Surgical approach can have an&#xD;
      important effect on post-operative recovery, complications and overall morbidity. Two&#xD;
      frequently used approaches will be compared in the proposed study: the HA and the mini-open&#xD;
      direct anterior approach. Outcome of HA vs mini-open direct anterior can thus be divided into&#xD;
      clinical and morphological outcome parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical outcome parameters should be divided in early and long term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early outcome is especially related to the surgery itself and postoperative&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Outcome parameters are complication rate, hospital stay, blood loss,&#xD;
      transfusion rate and functional recovery. The easiest way to describe functional outcome is&#xD;
      by using internationally recognized and validated outcome scores. They are developed as an&#xD;
      instrument to assess the patient's opinion about their hip and associated problems. These&#xD;
      validated scores aim to assess the functionality and disability of the hip. The functional&#xD;
      short and long term results of surgical procedures can be monitored with these outcome&#xD;
      scores. In this study we use the Harris Hip Score, Hip disability and Osteoartritis Outcome&#xD;
      Score (HOOS) and The Western Ontario and MacMaster (WOMAC) score. The Harris Hip Score (HHS)&#xD;
      is probably one of the most frequently used scores to assess the outcome of procedures&#xD;
      related to the hip joint16. Finally, the Hip disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score&#xD;
      (HOOS) is a validated scoring system that consists of 39 items, divided into 5 sub-scales&#xD;
      (i.e. pain, other symptoms, activity limitations in daily living (ADL), activity limitations&#xD;
      in recreation and sport, and hip-related quality of life (QoL))17. The Western Ontario and&#xD;
      MacMaster (WOMAC) is also a frequently used outcome tool and can be subtracted from the HOOS&#xD;
      score18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The late (&gt;1 year) outcome parameters are the late complication rate and conversion to&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The morphological outcome is determined on anteroposterior pelvic x-rays and cross-table&#xD;
      lateral views acquired preoperatively and 6 weeks after surgery. Several specific signs will&#xD;
      be recorded. The presence of a cross-over sign 19 (COS), a posterior wall sign 19 (PWS), a&#xD;
      prominence of the ischial spine 23 (PRISS) and a herniation pit 24 will be noted.&#xD;
      Supplementary the CE-Angle 25, AC-Index 26, and quantitative COS 27 and the OA grade&#xD;
      according to Tönnis 20 will be assessed. Additionally, the resection width angle 28 and the&#xD;
      resection depth ratio 28 will be determined as schematically presented in Table 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On reconstructed radial reformations of arthro-CT scans acquired pre-operatively and 3 months&#xD;
      after surgery, the alpha angle 18, anterior femoral head-neck offset 29, resection width&#xD;
      angle, resection depth ratio, acetabular depth and the anterior acetabular coverage angle&#xD;
      will be measured each on 7 positions from anterior to posterosuperior according to Locher 30&#xD;
      In summary, the proposed study is a randomized controlled study that focuses on the early and&#xD;
      late clinical and morphological outcome parameters of the Hip Arthroscopy vs the mini-open&#xD;
      direct anterior surgical approach in treatment of symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the study To assess surgical approach as a prognosticator for early and late&#xD;
      functional recovery, complication rate and rate of morphological bony correction in patients&#xD;
      with symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement Organisation This Randomised Controlled Trail&#xD;
      (RCT) is set-up as a mono-center study. Surgeon: the prime investigator who will be perform&#xD;
      all surgery . The patients will be pre-operatively randomly allocated (1:1 ratio) to either&#xD;
      the HA or Mini-open direct anterior cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are formulated in terms of the Harris Hip Outcome score and morphological&#xD;
      bony correction described by alpha angle, CE-angle and resection depth angle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are the HOOS, WOMAC score, radiographic measures on AP pelvis view and&#xD;
      arthro-CT as mentioned in Table 1 Contact with patients, surgery and follow-up will be done&#xD;
      by the prime investigators but the functional and clinical assessments will be carried out by&#xD;
      independent and blinded investigators trained in these investigations . These data will be&#xD;
      prospectively collected in a protected database structure that allows for easy input and&#xD;
      query assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. METHODS: PARTICIPANTS. All patients eligible for hip replacement surgery between August&#xD;
      2012 and December 2013 will be asked to participate the study in case they meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are eligible to be included when they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Age:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - 15-80 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gender: 1:1 ratio of males and females / cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. BMI: &lt;30kg/m&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Symptomatic FAI proven by clinical examination, plain radiographs and positive arthro-CT&#xD;
           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Clinical inclusion criteria: A positive impingement sign together with hip internal&#xD;
           rotation in the 90° flexed hip position of less than 10° are the main clinical criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Morphologic inclusion: a cam deformity (alpha angle higher 55°) 17 on radial arthro CT&#xD;
           together with corresponding chondrolabral lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Previous surgery on their hip&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Radiological investigations show acetabular retroversion with insufficient posterior&#xD;
           wall (positive posterior wall sign) 19, additional acetabular dysplasia according to&#xD;
           Lequesne's criteria 18, sequels of childhood hip disease such as Perthes disease or&#xD;
           slipped capital femoral epiphysis, or hip OA higher to grade 1 according to Tönnis 20.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Neurologic impairment Reasons for withdrawal from the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Simple request by the patient, even without giving a reason. 2. Decision by the&#xD;
      investigator, based upon suspicion of non-compliance by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Unexpected events not related to the surgical procedure such as serious illness that might&#xD;
      impair the functionality of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Recruitment will be done in the outpatient clinic. We reviewed a total of 26&#xD;
      patients who got a single- arthroscopic CAM resection in our centre by one single surgeon and&#xD;
      measured a mean alpha-angle of 38° with a standard deviation of 7.5° after correction of the&#xD;
      cam deformity. We assumed that if an alternative surgical technique would result in alpha&#xD;
      angles differing less than 7.5° when compared to the angles after hip arthroscopy , this&#xD;
      technique would be equivalent. Accordingly, a 7.5° difference was used for sample size&#xD;
      calculation and revealed a number of 14 patients in each group in order to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis with a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to include 20 patients in every group. This is certainly possible in a monocentric&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total minimum blinded follow-up is 2 years for the early outcomes and 5 and 10 years for the&#xD;
      late outcome parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial entry procedure The prime investigators will propose participation to the eligible&#xD;
      patients in the outpatient clinic, as soon as surgery has been decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive oral information and an 'Informed Consent form' with Patient&#xD;
      information sheet' (see Addendum 1) for home study. This will give the patient time to think&#xD;
      it over and to discuss it with the general practitioner, who will be informed by the&#xD;
      investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomisation will be done as soon as the patient agrees to join this trial. 3. METHODS:&#xD;
      INTERVENTIONS General anaesthesia will be used for all surgeries. The arthroscopic technique,&#xD;
      patient positioning and portal placements followed Byrd's 12 description using fluoroscopy.&#xD;
      Osteochondroplasty will be intra-operatively with direct visualization an impingement-free&#xD;
      flexion and internal rotation. The mini-open technique will be used as described by Clohisy&#xD;
      8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For both techniques at least 30° of internal rotation in the 90° flexed hip position was the&#xD;
      goal. Whereas weight bearing as tolerated on two crutches for 6 weeks was prescribed after&#xD;
      HA, patients after mini-open technique will be prescribed touch weight bearing on two&#xD;
      crutches as long as necessary for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent and trained study nurse who will be blinded for the performed procedure will&#xD;
      assess all patients at all time intervals. All patients will be assessed at the same time&#xD;
      intervals: pre-operatively, 6w, 3-6-12-24months. The primary endpoints will already be&#xD;
      assessed at a minimum follow-up of 12 months post-operatively as an intermediate and&#xD;
      preliminary audit of the trial in order to detect any flaws and to re-evaluate the&#xD;
      power-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. METHODS: OBJECTIVES. To assess surgical approach as a prognosticator for early and late&#xD;
      functional recovery, complication rate and rate of morphological bony correction in patients&#xD;
      with symptomatic femoroacetabular impingement 5. METHODS: SAMPLE SIZE We reviewed a total of&#xD;
      26 patients who got a single- arthroscopic CAM resection in our centre by one single surgeon&#xD;
      and measured a mean alpha-angle of 38° with a standard deviation of 7.5° after correction of&#xD;
      the cam deformity. We assumed that if an alternative surgical technique would result in alpha&#xD;
      angles differing less than 7.5° when compared to the angles after hip arthroscopy , this&#xD;
      technique would be equivalent. Accordingly, a 7.5° difference was used for sample size&#xD;
      calculation and revealed a number of 14 patients in each group in order to reject the null&#xD;
      hypothesis with a significance level of 5% and a power of 80%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to include 20 patients in every group. This is certainly possible in a monocentric&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total minimum blinded follow-up is 2 years for the early outcomes and 5 and 10 years for the&#xD;
      late outcome parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. METHODS: RANDOMIZATION. After the patient has agreed to joint trial and signed informed&#xD;
      consent form, he or she will be assigned to the study and will be given a registration&#xD;
      number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This number will be signed on the sealed and non-transparent envelope that has been picked&#xD;
      from the randomisation box. The envelope will be opened, the paper inside the envelope will&#xD;
      first be signed with the registration number and the paper will then be unfolded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is then allocated to a study cohort and marked in the study database that is only&#xD;
      accessible for the data monitor and the prime investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next the envelope is closed again and put into a sealed box until the end of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research nurse together with the patient will fill in the pre-operative clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. METHODS: RANDOMIZATION. Randomisation will be done by 20 pieces of paper into a&#xD;
      randomisation box signed with &quot;HA&quot; and 20 with &quot;DAA&quot;. These pieces will be 4-folded so that&#xD;
      the registration number of the patient can be written on the outside of the paper. The 40&#xD;
      pieces of paper will be put in sealed envelopes that are non-transparent and are put into one&#xD;
      'Randomisation box' by the data monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will pick the envelope in the presence of the data monitor. A sealed&#xD;
      'Post-intervention box' will be created and all opened and signed envelopes and papers will&#xD;
      be collected in this box that will only be accessible by the data monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After patients have been assigned to a cohort they are scheduled for surgery. 8. METHODS:&#xD;
      BLINDING (MASKING). Of course, the surgeon / prime investigator cannot be blinded. As a&#xD;
      consequence he cannot be an assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be blinded prior to surgery but will be able to differentiate the utilized&#xD;
      approach based upon the incisions used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessors however, namely the study nurse and evaluating junior-trainee will be blinded&#xD;
      to the utilized approach. They will not be able to see the scar and the patient will be asked&#xD;
      not to mention anything about the utilized approach. In case the patient would do this, than&#xD;
      he or she will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
