             of 19.0 kg/m2-29.0 kg/m2 (including the critical value);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Primary liver disease (except for drug-induced liver injury) is necessary for patients&#xD;

             5-6) who are assessed as grade A according to Child-Pugh classification must be taken&#xD;
             the clinical stability was ≥ 28 days before taking the experimental drug; while&#xD;
             patients with moderate liver impairment (Child-Pugh score: 7-9) who are assessed as&#xD;
             grade B according to Child-Pugh classification must be taken the clinical stability&#xD;
             was ≥ 14 days before taking the experimental drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have stable medication regimen for liver impairment, complications and&#xD;
             other concomitant diseases within at least 28 days before taking the experimental&#xD;
             drug, and the medication does not need to be adjusted (including drug type, dosage or&#xD;
             frequency) during the clinical trials; or those who do not use the drug;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The function of vital organs meets the following criteria: Absolute neutrophil count&#xD;
             (ANC) ≥ 1.0 × 109 / L (1000 / mm3); Hemoglobin (Hgb) ≥ 9.0 g / dL (90g / L); Platelet&#xD;

             corrected QTc interval (QTcF) was less than 450 msec (male);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In addition to liver impairment and complications, the investigator judged good&#xD;
             condition according to the history inquiry, vital signs, physical examination, routine&#xD;
             laboratory examination, 12-lead ECG, abdominal ultrasound scan, EEG, etc., and there&#xD;
             was no other clinically significant abnormality;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male subjects are willing to have no family planning during the trial and within 6&#xD;
             months after the last administration of the trial drug, and voluntarily take effective&#xD;
