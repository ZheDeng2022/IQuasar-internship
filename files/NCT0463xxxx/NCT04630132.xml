  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frailty is a syndrome in which the accumulation of small, individually insignificant deficits&#xD;
      leads to heightened vulnerability to adverse events and predisposes to potential catastrophic&#xD;
      decompensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective of this study is to clarify the underlying genetic and immunological mechanisms&#xD;
      responsible of frailty condition focused on: i. nephrosclerosis ageing kidney phenotype&#xD;
      related to salt effects on immunosystem, ii. immunological aspect of sarcopenia, iii.&#xD;
      psychological disorder related to immunosystem activation, iv. detection of new biomarkers of&#xD;
      frailty.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The cross-sectional, observational cohort study include 1500 subjects (age &gt;65 years)&#xD;
      subdivided in 750 cases and 750 controls according to frailty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who met the following criteria are included: 1) older than 65; 2) able to walk 500 m&#xD;
      without assistance; 3) a Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) score &lt;18; and 4) no severe&#xD;
      health problems (eg, uncontrolled hypertension, recent upper or lower extremity fractures,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction within the past 1 year).&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to definition for the 'phenotype' of frailty (cases) is as follows: presence of&#xD;
      three or more of the following features:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Decreased grip strength&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-reported exhaustion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Unintentional weight loss of more than 4.5 kg over the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Slow walking speed&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Low physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators select as control subjects with presence of less than 1 criteria . All the&#xD;
      control subjects are evaluated by the same protocol than the cases. Subjects will be&#xD;
      collected in collaboration with senior housing (RSA) of Milano city, country clubs, social&#xD;
      club for elderly, and elderly university. The study will be approved by the Ethics Committee&#xD;
      of ASL of Milano city and at individual centers by local ethical committees. All the study&#xD;
      participants signed informed consent. At the baseline evaluation, a large amount of data is&#xD;
      collected. First, the participants completed a battery of self-reported questionnaires&#xD;
      concerning the demographic characteristics, psychosocial adjustment, quality of life, and&#xD;
      health condition, in the presence of a trained psychologist in order to clarify any doubts.&#xD;
      Second, an expert in physical education and adapted physical activity for older adults&#xD;
      administered physical tests. Finally, people with expertise in the eld of ergonomics take&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements. Data collection is always carried out in the same order and&#xD;
      individually for each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all the subjects following clinical and laboratoristic data are collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Clinical evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Collection of anamnestic data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Blood pressure measurement. Blood pressure is measured by a trained nurse using an&#xD;
           authomatic device (OMRON) and an appropriately sized cuff. Readings are obtained after 5&#xD;
           min of seated rest. The mean of 3 blood pressure measurements obtained at 1-min&#xD;
           intervals during the medical evaluation is used to define SBP and DBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluation of kidney function :&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. CKD is defined as a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) lower than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 or&#xD;
           markers of kidney damage, such as albuminuria,for greater than 3 months. A&#xD;
           creatinine-based formula is used to estimate GFR, applying Chronic Kidney Disease&#xD;
           Epidemiology Collaboration (CKD-EPI) equations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           b. Urine analysis and albumin /creatinine and sodium /creatinine ratio urinary&#xD;
           excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Physical frailty measure. To identify physically frail older adults, an adapted version of&#xD;
      the frailty phenotype of Fried et al is used. Subjects with three or more criteria are&#xD;
      classified as frail, those with one or two as prefrail, and those meeting none as robust.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Body composition: Height and weight are detected. Bioimpedance analysis (BIA) is a&#xD;
           system of evaluation of body composition, able to calculate adjunctive information:&#xD;
           total body water (TBW), extra and intracellular water (ECW and ICW), body cell mass&#xD;
           (BCM), muscle mass (MM), fat mass (FM), fat free mass (FFM), basal metabolic rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SPPB: The short physical performance battery (SPPB) is a group of measures that combines&#xD;
           the results of the gait speed, chair stand and balance tests. It has been used as a&#xD;
           predictive tool for possible disability and can aid in the monitoring of function in&#xD;
           older people. The scores range from 0 (worst performance) to 12 (best performance).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PASE: Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE) is a brief (5 minutes) and easily&#xD;
           scored survey designed specifically to assess physical activity in epidemiological&#xD;
           studies of persons age 65 years and older. The PASE score combines information on&#xD;
           leisure, household and occupational activity. The PASE assesses the types of activities&#xD;
           typically chosen by older adults (walking, recreational activities, exercise, housework,&#xD;
           yard work, and caring for others. It uses frequency, duration, and intensity level of&#xD;
           activity over the previous week to assign a score, ranging from 0 to 793, with higher&#xD;
           scores indicating greater physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sarcopenia will be defined as fat-free mass index (FFMI) below the 25th percentile combined&#xD;
      with one of the following functional parameter: either an SPPB score ≤8 or a comfortable gait&#xD;
      speed &lt;1.0 m/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Psychological test will be used to assess self conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE): The Mini-Mental Stat Examination (MMSE) is a&#xD;
           10-minute measure of cognitive impairment in undeveloped, uneducated, diseased, or very&#xD;
           old populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Geriatric Depression Scale-short form (GDS-15): The Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS) is&#xD;
           a 15- item self-report validated measure for rating depression in elderly adults.&#xD;
           Additionally, the GDS is sensitive to depression among elderly adults suffering from&#xD;
           mild to moderate dementia and elderly adults with physical illnesses by excluding&#xD;
           questions pertaining to somatic complaints and cognitive dimension of depression. In&#xD;
           this scale, a score of 6 or higher may be indicative of depression and must be evaluated&#xD;
           jointly with patient's clinical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. SF-36 Medical Outcomes Study (MOS) 36-item Short Form Health Survey: This instrument&#xD;
           should capture both mental and physical aspects of health. The 36 6-likert item assess&#xD;
           health across eight domains, namely bodily pain, general health perceptions, mental&#xD;
           health, physical functioning, role limitations due to emotional health problems, role&#xD;
           limitations due to physical health problems, social functioning, and vitality. All items&#xD;
           use categorical response options (range: 2-6 options). Two component summary scores for&#xD;
           physical and mental health (MPS and MCS, respectively) can also be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Laboratory Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Genotyping. OpenArray technology (ThermoFisher) for genetic characterization of Single&#xD;
           Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs), based on TaqMan chemistry. DNA will be used for&#xD;
           genotyping of genetic variants in loci for Klotho (KL) gene, Adducins (ADD1, ADD2 and&#xD;
           ADD3) and EO synthesis (LSS, HSD3B1), metabolism (CYP11A1, ABCB1), and activity (SLC8A1,&#xD;
           SIK1) genes, and for immunological pathway (TLR4, HMGB1, IL6, IL1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Biochemical measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Endogenous Ouabain measurement&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Plasma Klotho measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Immunological determinations. Simultaneous assessment of serum concentrations of&#xD;
           epidermal growth factor (EGF), fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2), FMS-like tyrosine&#xD;
           kinase 3 ligand (Flt-3L), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF),&#xD;
           granulocyte-monocyte colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF), interferon-α2 (IFN-α2), INF-γ,&#xD;
           IL-10, IL-15, IL-17, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-6, IL-8, INF-γ inducible protein 10 (IP-10),&#xD;
           monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), macrophage inflammatory protein-1β (MIP-1&#xD;
           β), platelet-derived growth factor-AA (PDGF-AA), soluble CD40 ligand (sCD40L),&#xD;
           transforming growth factor alpha (TGF-α), TNF-α and vascular endothelial growth factor&#xD;
           (VEGF).&#xD;
