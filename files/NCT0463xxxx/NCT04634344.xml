  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will treat patients with Metastatic Castration Resistant Prostate Cancer who have&#xD;
      progressed following prior therapy. This is the first time this drug has ever been tested in&#xD;
      patients, and so it will help to understand what type of side effects may occur with the drug&#xD;
      treatment. It will also measure the the levels of drug in the body and preliminarily assess&#xD;
      its anti-cancer activity as monotherapy.&#xD;
