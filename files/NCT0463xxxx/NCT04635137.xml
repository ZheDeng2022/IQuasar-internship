    <textblock>
      The aim of this research study is to assess the effectiveness of combined ablation and&#xD;
      cementoplasty in the treatment of spinal, pelvic, and extraspinal lesions causing pain&#xD;
      resistant to conventional treatment at our centre. In particular, the investigator seek to&#xD;
      verify the safety and efficacy for multiple primary tumor types and benign lesions as well as&#xD;
      encompass multiple measurements of outcome, including visual analog scale (VAS) for pain,&#xD;
      opioid and analgesic use, and overall performance scales, combined with cross-sectional&#xD;
      imaging follow-up to assess tumor burden, to ascertain a comprehensive Canadian single-centre&#xD;
      experience that has been lacking in previous studies.&#xD;

      Research Question &amp; Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a prospective, single-centre study of combined ablation and cementoplasty&#xD;
           treatment for painful spinal and extraspinal osseous lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Report the technical outcome and safety of percutaneous ablation prior to image-guided&#xD;
           cementoplasty in a single treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Review the effectiveness and durability of pain control, local tumor control, and the&#xD;
           impact on QoL using ablation and cementoplasty in treating spinal/extraspinal osseous&#xD;
           tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the feasibility and efficacy of ablation and cementoplasty treatment for&#xD;
           different primary tumor types and benign lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will conduct a single-centre, single-arm, cohort analysis of all patients&#xD;
      who undergo cementoplasty for osseous disease in the department of interventional radiology&#xD;
      over a two-year period. This will be a prospective paired comparison study with patients&#xD;
      serving as their own controls. Technical success and procedural complications will be&#xD;
      monitored and recorded for all patients. All patients will be followed until death or 3&#xD;
      months post-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to enroll a minimum of 40 patients referred for symptomatic osseous&#xD;
      lesions. Bipolar radiofrequency ablation (Osteocool RFA system, Medtronic) or cryoablation&#xD;
      (Visual Ice Cryoablation, Boston Scientific) will be performed under CT, ultrasound, or&#xD;
      fluoroscopic guidance at the discretion of the treating radiologist, and immediately followed&#xD;
      by cement injection. Radiological outcomes, including local tumor control and disease&#xD;
      progression, will be assessed by CT imaging immediately post-procedure as well as 3-month&#xD;
      follow-up. Clinical outcomes will be evaluated by VAS, analgesic use, and QoL assessment&#xD;
      using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) prior to procedure and immediately post-procedure, as well at&#xD;
      1-week, 1-month, and 3-month intervals post-procedure.&#xD;
