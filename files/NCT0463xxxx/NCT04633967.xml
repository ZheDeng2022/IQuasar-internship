      This observational study will evaluate and anaylse primary data investigating the effects of&#xD;
      a novel peri-infusion regimen in MS patients in a Candian clinical setting infused with&#xD;
      Alemtuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study has been developed by a Canadian neurologist with the intent to&#xD;
      treat MS patients receiving Alemtuzumab in order to mitigate infusion associated reactions&#xD;
      (safety) by utilizing an alternative peri-infusion protocol which is a deviation from the&#xD;
      recommendation in the Canadian Product Monograph.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients' recruited for this observational study were informed and consented for this&#xD;
      novel peri-infusion regimen and were clinically followed by the neurologist for the two&#xD;
      Alemtuzumab infusion cycles and for any subsequent Alemtuzumab infusions for potential&#xD;
      mitigation of infusion associated reactions associated with Alemtuzumab.&#xD;

    <description>This observational study is collecting clinical data focusing on infusion associated reactions and changes in vital signs in MS patients Novel Infusion protocol: The protocol consisted of the following Pre-infusion Protocol&#xD;
Premedication with an H1 and H2 blockade (ranitidine or similar, loratadine or similar) for 7 days prior to the infusion.&#xD;
Premedication with 50 mg of prednisone orally for 5 days before the infusion.&#xD;
During Infusion Protocol During infusions methylprednisolone is administered in a dosage of 500 mg on every day of the infusion.&#xD;
Post Infusion Medication&#xD;
Post-medication with an H1 and H2 blockade (ranitidine or similar, loratadine or similar) for 7 days after the infusion.&#xD;
Post-medication with 50 mg of prednisone orally for 5 days after the infusion.&#xD;
Medications to be used PRN throughout the peri-infusion protocol Benadryl, acetaminophen or other analgesics were allowed</description>
