    <textblock>
      a comparison shall be conducted between dexamethasone accompanied by bupivacaine, on one&#xD;
      hand, and dexmedetomedine accompanied by bupivacaine, on the other hand for pain-free knee&#xD;
      arthroscopic surgeries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Arthroscopic knee surgery can cause significant postoperative pain to the degree that can&#xD;
      potentially delay timely discharge from the ambulatory surgical setting. Analgesia after knee&#xD;
      surgery can be provided by multiple, non-systemic, non-opioid-based methods, including local&#xD;
      anesthetic infiltration, peripheral nerve blockade, neuraxial procedures, and intra-articular&#xD;
      injections. The femoral nerve block has been shown to be superior to traditional&#xD;
      intra-articular injection of local anesthetics in some knee surgeries, but motor blockade of&#xD;
      the quadriceps muscle, with the potential risk for falls, limits the value of femoral blocks&#xD;
      for less invasive ambulatory surgery. Orthopedic surgery is increasingly being performed on&#xD;
      an ambulatory basis, where perioperative analgesia can improve timely discharge in the&#xD;
      outpatient setting. A trans-arterial landmark-based distal approach to the saphenous nerve&#xD;
      block has been shown to reduce pain significantly by providing sensory block to the tissues&#xD;
      around the medial meniscus. The saphenous nerve, a terminal branch of the femoral nerve,&#xD;
      provides cutaneous sensation to the peripatellar region, and the medial aspect of the lower&#xD;
      extremity below the knee, as well as to the articular branches to the medial aspect of the&#xD;
      knee joint. The saphenous nerve separates from the femoral nerve in the proximal third of the&#xD;
      thigh, courses through the adductor canal with the nerve to the vastus medialis, and emerges&#xD;
      from the adductor hiatus to divide into the infrapatellar branch and the sartorial branch.&#xD;
      Traditionally, saphenous nerve blocks have been performed as an anatomical landmark-based&#xD;
      technique with marginal rates of success, as low as 33%. With ultrasound guidance, the&#xD;
      feasibility of effective saphenous nerve block at the adductor canal has been shown tp&#xD;
      increase. The adductor canal block may provide superior analgesia over traditional distal&#xD;
      saphenous nerve blocks for surgical procedures of the knee because this block includes the&#xD;
      saphenous nerve, the nerve to the vastus medialis, and potentially the articular contribution&#xD;
      of the obturator nerve to the knee joint. Our primary hypothesis was that performing an&#xD;
      adductor canal block as part of a multimodal analgesic regimen would result in improved&#xD;
      analgesia immediately following arthroscopic medial meniscectomy. Dexamethasone improves the&#xD;
      quality and duration of peripheral nerve block when used as an adjuvant to local anesthetic.&#xD;
      Possible mechanisms include: Dexamethasone (as a corticosteroid) was reported to attenuate&#xD;
      C-fiber responses. More recent publications indicate that 8 mg dexamethasone added to&#xD;
      perineural local anesthetic injections augment the duration of peripheral nerve block&#xD;
      analgesia. Dexmedetomidine is a useful sedative agent with analgesic properties, hemodynamic&#xD;
      stability and ability to recover respiratory function in mechanically ventilated patients&#xD;
      facilitating early weaning. Besides being a new modality of sedation and analgesia in ICU&#xD;
      patient management, it has been studied in several other perioperative settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      researchers suggested that dexmedetomidine likely affects the AÎ´ and unmyelinated C fibers&#xD;
      differently from motor neurons. This phenomenon has been observed before in the setting of&#xD;
      neuraxial blockade; however, the exact mechanism of action remains speculative and has been&#xD;
      addressed elsewhere. Rationale for using Adjuvants in Regional anesthesia:- Regional&#xD;
      anesthesia researchers have been exploring the strategies to prolong the duration of PNB&#xD;
      &quot;Peripheral Nerve Blockade&quot; analgesia in patients undergoing ambulatory procedures. Although&#xD;
      ambulatory catheters are an effective option, their practical utility is governed by a&#xD;
      stringent patient selection criteria. Liposomal bupivacaine is another effective alternative,&#xD;
      but its use is limited by price, availability, lack of FDA approval, and the similar&#xD;
      prolongation of both sensory and motor blockade duration it produces. Adjuvants constitute&#xD;
      another option, and numerous local anesthesia additives, have been explored in search of the&#xD;
      ideal adjunct that satisfies the criteria of effectively prolonging the duration of analgesia&#xD;
      and not being associated with a significant risk of neurotoxicity. Among these adjuncts,&#xD;
      dexamethasone has seemed most promising, because researchers have demonstrated its efficacy&#xD;
      when administered intravenously. However, dexmedetomidine as a local anesthetic adjunct may&#xD;
      ultimately prove superior to dexamethasone in terms of its differential prolongation of&#xD;
      sensory-motor blockade.&#xD;
