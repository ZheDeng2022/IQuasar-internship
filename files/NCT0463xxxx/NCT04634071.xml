  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Smoking cessation has been shown to improve the effectiveness and reduce the morbidity of&#xD;
      tobacco-related cancer treatments. We will identify effective smoking cessation strategies&#xD;
      for patients who are receiving treatment for tobacco-related cancer. In this trial, patients'&#xD;
      preferences in smoking cessation therapy will be the principal determinant by providers in&#xD;
      developing a three component regimen of pharmaceutical therapy, counseling, and nicotine&#xD;
      replacement therapy. This study will identify this cohort's preferences for smoking cessation&#xD;
      strategies. We will then examine the impact of utilizing patient preferences upon cessation&#xD;
      efficacy by directly comparing cessation success in this study with our recently completed&#xD;
      study of the same population using the same tobacco treatments which were randomly assigned.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Cigarette smoking is associated with decreased survival and decreased efficacy of&#xD;
      cancer therapy in those with smoking related malignancies. There is limited of study of&#xD;
      smoking cessation for cancer patients being treated in regions with high tobacco use such as&#xD;
      Kentucky. There is little study of cessation implementation in the community cancer treatment&#xD;
      setting where the majority of cancer patients receive their cancer therapy. Most smokers have&#xD;
      significant exposure to information and personal experience with tobacco treatments which, in&#xD;
      some cases, leads to profound preferences. The effect of incorporating these patient&#xD;
      preferences into tobacco treatment planning has not been studied or quantified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Phase II therapeutic clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting University of Kentucky Markey Cancer Center (MCC) and its affiliate research network&#xD;
      of Community Cancer Centers (MCCRN)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Ninety-three subjects will be selected. All subjects will be active smoking oncology&#xD;
      patients with a diagnosis of smoking related malignancy who are beginning a new course of&#xD;
      therapy. In conjunction with their treating clinician, all subjects will be counseled and&#xD;
      then select one of 12 cessation strategies. This will include a choice of continuous&#xD;
      pharmacologic agent (veranicline, bupropion or transdermal nicotine patch), counseling&#xD;
      strategy (11 session high intensity motivational based counseling or single session low&#xD;
      intensity counseling), and whether or not to use as needed nicotine (gum, lozenges or spray).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis All subjects will be followed for six months. The primary endpoint will be a&#xD;
      carbon monoxide monitoring confirmed negative seven-day point prevalence report of cessation&#xD;
      at eight weeks. Data will then be analyzed and compared with a completed randomized clinical&#xD;
      trial of the same treatment strategies in the same population of subjects where the cessation&#xD;
      strategy was assigned (historical control). The proportion of subjects that have quit at week&#xD;
      eight will be compared to the historical control proportion (namely, whether Ho:p=po vs Ha:&#xD;
      p&gt;po). This will be assessed using a z-score for a binomial proportion which will test&#xD;
      whether the underlying proportion quitting at eight weeks (p) differs from the control&#xD;
      proportion (po ranging from 0.215 to 0.26) estimated from our recently completed randomized&#xD;
      trial of these same 12 cessation strategies.&#xD;
