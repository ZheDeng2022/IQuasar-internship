  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In our hypothesis, auricular acupoint stimulation might improve the attention and heart rate&#xD;
      variability in archery athletes. The meridian activities regarding the attention and action&#xD;
      in Chinese medicine systems might be influenced.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      During the execution of archery, attention is the key of performance in elite players,&#xD;
      especially in the initial period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auricular acupoint stimulation is one of the therapeutic methods of traditional Chinese&#xD;
      medicine. It is widely applied in various diseases. Researches had concluded the use of&#xD;
      auricular acupoint stimulation on amplifying the anesthesia effect, weight reduction and the&#xD;
      cessation of substance abuse. This study aimed to investigate the immediate effect of&#xD;
      non-invasive auricular acupoint stimulation on the performance and the meridian activities of&#xD;
      archery athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect the meridian activities and balance index with Ryodoraku&#xD;
      device, the continuous heart rate record and the scores of the two sections as the&#xD;
      performance. The participants will rate their attention and fatigue levels through filling&#xD;
      the self-reported questionnaires.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The participants were randomly assigned to the treatment group and the control group. The Ear-Acupressure group received the seeds attached by 3M tap to the auricular acupoints. The Sham-Acupressure group received sham acupoint stimulation, on the same points, but only with 3M tap. The procedure was then switched to perform cross-over study design.</masking_description>

    <measure>The change of meridian activities</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, one hour, two hours</time_frame>
    <description>The meridian activities and balance index were measured and calculated with Ryodoraku device. (Meridian Energy Analysis Device, MEAD, medpex, Taiwan) The activity will be shown by numbers which were calculated by the skin electric resistance. The higher the number is, the higher meridian activity is presented.</description>

    <description>The self-reported attention and fatigue questionnaire which focus at visual syndrome. VDTs fatigue scale is been applied and standarized by Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor and Welfare survey results, 2004. VDTs fatigue scale is composed with 13 items. Each item ranks from zero to five. Higher scores indicated higher distraction and fatigue levels.</description>
