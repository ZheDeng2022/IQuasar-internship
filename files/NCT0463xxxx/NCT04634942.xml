  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the literature is reviewed, there are few studies evaluating cold spray or ShotBlocker&#xD;
      in reducing pain associated with IM injection. Studies have shown that these applications are&#xD;
      mostly used in children during vaccination or intravenous interventions. These methods are&#xD;
      less commonly used on adults. Both methods without side effects are important in terms of&#xD;
      being cheap, easy to use and reusable. As a result of the researches, these methods can&#xD;
      provide a more comfortable injection experience and provide evidence for pain management,&#xD;
      especially in adults sensitive to pain.&#xD;

&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to use it to reduce pain associated with IM injection in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of cold spray and ShotBlocker applications on pain. In this study, it&#xD;
      was used to reduce pain associated with IM injection in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was aimed to evaluate the effect of ShotBlocker and cold spray application on pain. The&#xD;
      research is planned to be completed between February 2020 and December 2020. The universe of&#xD;
      the study, which was conducted as a randomized controlled trial model, consisted of all adult&#xD;
      patients who received diclofenac sodium treatment in Malatya Turgut Özal Medical Center&#xD;
      Emergency Service. 195 patients selected by the simple random sampling method (shotBlocker&#xD;
      group = 39, shotBlocker placebo = 39 spray groups = 39, spray group placebo = 39, control&#xD;
      group = 39) were included in the study. Participant Introduction Form and Visual Benchmarking&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) were used to collect data. According to the characteristics of the data In&#xD;
      independent groups, t test, ANOVA test, Mann Whitney U test, correlation were measured.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In the study, the randomization method was used to assign the patients to the groups to prevent manipulations that could be done consciously or unconsciously. A computer-assisted randomization program was used to make assignments to the groups. A random list was created in the computer environment by using random.org, assigning individuals to groups (117). 195 people, who will form the sample of the study, were divided into sets of 39, and sets were created by assigning numbers from 1 to 5 to each set. When the sets were obtained, the numbers from 1 to 5 were written on small papers, and group assignments were made by lot method.&#xD;

    <description>Cold spray group injection process step; In addition to the IM injection procedure steps, Cryos cold spray was applied to patients in this group after skin cleansing. Cryos cold spray sprayed 3 puffs from a distance of 20 cm to the skin, and the injection process was performed. Within 2 minutes after the injection process was completed, the patient was allowed to mark the intensity of pain caused by the needle while entering the tissue on the VAS.</description>

    <description>ShotBlocker group injection process step; In addition to the IM injection procedure steps, after cleansing the skin of the patients in this group, the protruding part of the ShotBlocker was placed in contact with the skin. ShotBlocker was pressed firmly against the skin and the injection was made through the central opening of the ShotBlocker. ShotBlocker was removed from the skin after the injection was completed. Within 2 minutes after the injection process was completed, the patient was allowed to mark the intensity of pain caused by the needle while entering the tissue on the VAS.</description>

    <intervention_name>Cryos REF 0971 Cold Spray</intervention_name>
    <description>Cold Spray Coolant spray is manufactured from liquefied gases with high pressure. It acts by rapidly reducing the temperature in the body area where it is applied. The liquefied gas in the tube spreads on the skin in liquid form and takes the heat of the skin by turning into gas. The temperature of the area where it is applied drops from 30-32 degrees to 10-15 degrees. With the effect of the cold, the excitability of the nerve endings decreases, and thus the pain on the skin is felt by the person. Cold sprays, whose analgesic effect occurs immediately, are applied parallel to the muscle fibers in the area to be applied, from a distance of 15-45 centimeters, by squeezing for approximately 5-15 seconds. Cold sprays are suitable for long-term and multiple uses.</description>

    <description>ShotBlocker ShotBlocker is a plastic tool with a small and flat shape, with short and non-sharp protrusions on one side that connect with the skin. It resembles a horseshoe (C shaped) with its structure designed to expose the area to be injected. It is suitable for all age groups. It does not have any side effects. ShotBlocker can be used for both intramuscular and subcutaneous injections. The protruding surface of the ShotBlocker is held by pressing the skin during the injection and the process is performed from the part where the opening is.</description>
