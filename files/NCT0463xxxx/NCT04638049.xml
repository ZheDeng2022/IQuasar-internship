  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiotherapy (RT) of the abdomen and/or pelvis is known to cause acute and late&#xD;
      gastrointestinal (GI) toxicities. While radiation dose and volume are known risk factors for&#xD;
      developing such side effects, recent evidence suggests patterns of disturbance in the&#xD;
      composition of the GI microbiota - so called &quot;dysbiosis&quot; - may also promote the host's&#xD;
      susceptibility to GI toxicities through impaired intestinal barrier function and&#xD;
      inflammation. The IMPRINT-study aims to expand the current knowledge on the role of&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria and their metabolites involved in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      radiation-induced GI toxicities by longitudinally examining the microbiota composition&#xD;
      (feces), the associated metabolome (blood, feces and urine) and bacterial extracellular&#xD;
      vesicles (BEVs) (blood and feces).&#xD;

      The IMPRINT-study is a prospective biomarker study assessing the impact of different&#xD;
      treatment field sizes and associated radiation doses on the patient's microbiome and&#xD;
      metabolome, whereby the link with radiation-induced GI toxicities will be emphasized. Blood,&#xD;
      urine and fecal samples will be longitudinally collected at 4 different time points: (1)&#xD;
      shortly before, (2) during and (3) shortly after RT treatment, as well as (4) one-month&#xD;
      post-RT. To our knowledge, this is the first clinical research project relating the impact of&#xD;
      multiple radiation parameters on fecal-, urine- and blood-based biomarkers to risk of GI&#xD;
      toxicities in a homogeneously defined study population.&#xD;
