      A study to evaluate the long-term risk of hepatic failure with TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) and&#xD;
      the mechanism of liver injury based upon liver biopsy information among patients who received&#xD;
      or are receiving TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) and experience hepatotoxicity.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This FDA post-marketing requirement study will evaluate the long-term risk of hepatic failure&#xD;
      with TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) and the mechanism of liver injury based upon liver biopsy&#xD;
      information among patients who received or are receiving TURALIO™ (pexidartinib) for&#xD;
      symptomatic tenosynovial giant cell tumor (TGCT) associated with severe morbidity or&#xD;
      functional limitations and not amenable to improvement with surgery, and who experience&#xD;
      hepatotoxicity. A liver biopsy will be collected from enrolled patients for central&#xD;
      laboratory analysis of macrophage and immune cell profiles to investigate possible mechanisms&#xD;
      of the hepatotoxicity. Additionally, 4 blood samples will be collected to evaluate liver&#xD;
      function, other relevant safety tests, peripheral immune cells, and for pharmacogenomic&#xD;
      testing. Enrolled patients will be followed at least yearly for 10 years to assess long-term&#xD;
      risk of hepatic failure.&#xD;

      The liver biopsy will be performed as soon as reasonably possible after the liver test&#xD;
      abnormality criteria are first met and before liver tests have returned to normal. Four blood&#xD;
      samples will be drawn on the day of, or up to 4 days before, the biopsy. One sample will&#xD;
      evaluate liver test results (alanine aminotransferase [ALT], aspartate aminotransferase&#xD;
      [AST], alkaline phosphatase [ALP], gammaglutamyl transferase [GGT], total bilirubin [TBIL],&#xD;
      direct bilirubin), serum creatinine, and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at the study site. The&#xD;
      remaining three samples will be used for central laboratory analysis.&#xD;
