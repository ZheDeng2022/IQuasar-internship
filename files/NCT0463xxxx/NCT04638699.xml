  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adequate, needs-oriented psycho-oncological care contributes to reducing the burden on cancer&#xD;
      patients and their relatives and to improving the quality of life. There is still a need for&#xD;
      clarification regarding the need and the determination of psychosocial needs. This&#xD;
      multi-center study (3 centers: Hanover, Leipzig and Dresden) aims at a professionalization of&#xD;
      psychosocial screening, in order to enable thus an exact and need-based allocation to&#xD;
      psycho-oncological support. The optimization and professionalization of the psychosocial&#xD;
      screening process shall be achieved by a training of oncological nursing and development of&#xD;
      an interdisciplinary care algorithm. The aim is to examine whether &quot;OptiScreen&quot; increases the&#xD;
      targeted and needs-based allocation to psycho-oncology.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Adequate, needs-oriented psycho-oncological care contributes to reducing the burden on cancer&#xD;
      patients and their families and to improving the quality of life of all those affected. In&#xD;
      order to ensure patient-oriented psycho-oncological care, it is necessary to allocate&#xD;
      psychologically burdened patients and patients in need of care to psycho-oncology by means of&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the framework of this multicenter study (Hannover, Leipzig and Dresden), a newly&#xD;
      designed training of nursing staff (&quot;OptiScreen training&quot;) on mental stress and&#xD;
      psycho-oncological care is intended to increase the precise identification of mentally&#xD;
      stressed patients in need of treatment, to increase the allocation of these patients to&#xD;
      psycho-oncology and to improve interdisciplinary cooperation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. targeted, needs-based allocation to psycho-oncology&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. increasing the acceptance of psycho-oncological screening by patients* and treatment&#xD;
           team&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. increase of patient competence and satisfaction&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. increasing the acceptance of psycho-oncological treatment by patients and treatment team&#xD;
           In summary, the findings of this multi-center study should contribute to the improvement&#xD;
           of interdisciplinary cooperation, improve the demand-oriented and targeted allocation of&#xD;
           psychologically burdened patients to psycho-oncological care and thus develop a &quot;best&#xD;
           practice model&quot; of an interdisciplinary care algorithm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include inpatients from the visceral oncology centers at the three sites who&#xD;
      have the necessary cognitive, physical and linguistic abilities. The study is divided into 2&#xD;
      phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Survey of the current status For this purpose, N = 300 patients* in the visceral&#xD;
      oncology centers are interviewed with a questionnaire during the inpatient stay (t0) and&#xD;
      three months later (t1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected will include psychological stress, disease management/treatment, quality&#xD;
      of life and treatment satisfaction of persons with oncological diseases. In addition, the&#xD;
      needs for information and support, the practicability as well as the allocation to&#xD;
      psycho-oncological care and its utilization will be surveyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Execution of the &quot;OptiScreen training&quot;: special psycho-oncological training of the nursing&#xD;
      staff for basic knowledge about the experience of psychological stress as well as diagnostics&#xD;
      of psychosocial stress will take place after the completion of phase 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: survey after the OptiScreen training Analogous to phase 1, N = 600 patients* in the&#xD;
      visceral oncology centers are interviewed during the inpatient stay (t0) and three months&#xD;
      later (t1).&#xD;
