  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to compare ethmoid, sphenoid and maxillary sinus volumes of patients&#xD;
      with maxillary deficiency requiring Le Fort osteotomy with healthy patients, by employing&#xD;
      computed tomography imaging. No accessible information could be found on this subject during&#xD;
      literature search. The authors believe anatomical knowledge of these structures in patients&#xD;
      with maxillary deficiency will influence all branches performing surgeries in these areas.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The anatomy of the paranasal sinuses is important for many surgeon groups. The precise&#xD;
      knowledge of such structures with variable anatomy will be important for the preservation of&#xD;
      these structures and the management of complications in surgeries such as endoscopic sinus&#xD;
      surgery and osteotomies involving the maxilla such as Le Fort osteotomies. The&#xD;
      maxillomandibular complex is often affected by developmental problems and growth problems,&#xD;
      and unilateral, bilateral, horizontal, vertical and / or transverse deficiencies are&#xD;
      observed. Treatment of this complex is often performed by surgical intervention involving one&#xD;
      or both jaws. In surgeries involving the maxilla, maxillary sinuses are affected by the&#xD;
      surgery and affect the course of surgery. Paranasal sinuses are also very important&#xD;
      structures for closely related endoscopic sinus surgeries. Detailed preoperative&#xD;
      investigation is crucial for patient selection and hence desired outcome. Study was conducted&#xD;
      in Ankara University Faculty of Dentistry with Ethical approval number:08/03. Computed&#xD;
      tomography scans of 120 patients (59 maxillary deficiency patients and 61 healthy controls)&#xD;
      were included in the study. CT scan indications for the group with maxillary deficiency was&#xD;
      surgical preparation for Le Fort I osteotomy. The control group had no maxillary deficiency&#xD;
      and CT images were obtained for several reasons such as temporomandibular disease,&#xD;
      preparation for orthodontic treatment, obstructive sleep apnea and also paranasal sinus&#xD;
      imaging Patients with a history of trauma in the midline skull base were excluded.&#xD;
      Statistically significant results were obtained between groups for ethmoid and maxillary&#xD;
      sinus volumes (left and right). Ethmoid and maxillary sinus volumes (left and right) were&#xD;
      smaller in the Le Fort group. No statistically significant differences were present for&#xD;
      sphenoid sinus volume of two groups and for the left and right maxillary sinus volumes in&#xD;
      both groups.&#xD;
