    <textblock>
      Objectives The aim of this study is to compare the effects of inducing positive expectations&#xD;
      against negative or neutral induced expectations on the activation of the Autonomic Nervous&#xD;
      System and the analgesic response, after a dry needling technique in upper trapezius fibers&#xD;
      in patients with unspecific neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary Theoretical framework: Dry needling has proven its efficacy for the treatment of&#xD;
      myofascial trigger points. Moreover, it has proven its effects over the Central Nervous&#xD;
      System and the Autonomic Nervous System (ANS). Despite that previous studies have researched&#xD;
      the role of patient's expectations and their relationship with the results of treatment,&#xD;
      there is insufficient information concerning the effects of inducing expectations and the&#xD;
      activation of the ANS during the application of widely used therapies, such as dry needling.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study will be to research the effects of induced expectations combined with a&#xD;
      dry needling technique on the activation of the ANS and on the results of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The induction of a positive expectation shall cause a greater analgesic response&#xD;
      associated with a response in the ANS compared to the induction of neutral or negative&#xD;
      expectations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with neck pain will participated in this randomized clinical trial, which&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned into 3 groups in order to receive positive, neutral or negative&#xD;
      expectations concerning the treatment, by means of an individual informative talk. All&#xD;
      subjects will received treatment using dry needling in the upper trapezius fibers. The main&#xD;
      variables measured will be the following: Analogic Visual Scale, Pressure Pain Threshold&#xD;
      using a mechanical Force Gage (before and after) and the activation of the ANS measuring the&#xD;
      skin conductance, skin temperature, heart rate and breathing rate (monitored for 5 minutes&#xD;
      before the intervention, during and 20 minutes afterwards).&#xD;

    <description>It is the measure of the variations in the electrical resistance of the skin, caused by the excitation of the sweat glands, controlled by the Sympathetic Nervous System (SNS)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at twenty minutes</time_frame>
    <description>It will be collected through the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). It is a continuous scale, which consists of a 100 mm horizontal straight line, so that zero is equivalent to &quot;total absence of pain&quot; and 100 to &quot;more bearable pain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pressure pain threshold</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at twenty minutes.</time_frame>
    <description>The pressure pain threshold is defined as the minimum amount of pressure necessary to cause pain. It has been measured through a Force Dial FDK using a mechanical Force Gage (Wagner Instruments).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Heart rate variability</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline at twenty minutes</time_frame>
    <description>This variable is defined as the variation of the heartbeat in a previously defined period in an analysis of consecutive circadian periods. It measures the time in milliseconds between the R waves of two consecutive beats (known as the RR interval) and is widely used in the field of Cardiology for the stratification of patients after an acute myocardial infarction. It has also been shown to be a useful tool in detecting ANS activation.</description>
