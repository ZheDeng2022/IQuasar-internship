  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of guselkumab compared to&#xD;
      placebo, in combination with a 26-week glucocorticoid (GC) taper regimen, in adult&#xD;
      participants with new-onset or relapsing giant cell arteritis (GCA).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Giant cell arteritis (GCA) is a non-necrotizing granulomatous systemic vasculitis of unknown&#xD;
      etiology affecting medium-sized and large arteries usually accompanied or preceded by&#xD;
      systemic inflammation. Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody (mAb) that binds to the p19&#xD;
      sub-unit of human interleukin (IL)-23 with high affinity and blocks binding of extracellular&#xD;
      IL-23 to cell surface IL-23 receptor, inhibiting IL 23 specific intracellular signaling and&#xD;
      subsequent activation and cytokine production. It is used in treatment of psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis, generalized pustular psoriasis, erythrodermic psoriasis. The study consists of a&#xD;
      screening period (less than or equal to [&lt;=] 6 weeks), double-blind treatment period (48&#xD;
      weeks), and safety follow-up period (12 weeks). Participants who complete the Week 52 visit&#xD;
      and are assessed to be in glucocorticoid (GC)-free remission, may have the option to&#xD;
      participate in the long-term extension (LTE) period of the study for up to 12 months. This&#xD;
      study will evaluate the efficacy, safety, Pharmacokinetics (PK), and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) and subcutaneous (SC) administered guselkumab in combination with a 26-week&#xD;
      GC taper regimen for the treatment of active new-onset or relapsing GCA in adult&#xD;
      participants. The total duration of the study is up to 66 weeks for the main study and for&#xD;
      participants that continue in the LTE period, the total study duration will be up to 112&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
