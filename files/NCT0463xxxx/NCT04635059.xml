      This phase 2, single-arm, open-label study using pacritinib will treat patients with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed prostate adenocarcinoma, status post definitive treatment and&#xD;
      biochemical recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the effect of pacritinib on the time to&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) progression in patients with biochemical relapse of prostate&#xD;
      cancer (defined as the length of time that a given subject will be alive and free from PSA&#xD;
      progression per Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) guidelines.&#xD;
