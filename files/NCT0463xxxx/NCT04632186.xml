    <textblock>
      In an innovative approach, a full body suit with multiple electrodes for provision off&#xD;
      electrical stimulation has been developed by a Swedish Med-tech company. Based on theoretical&#xD;
      background and clinical experience, this study will explore the potential value of the&#xD;
      EXOPULSE Mollii suit-method in the management of post stroke shoulder pain. The overall aim&#xD;
      of this study is to test and further develop the Mollii-suit for its ability to reduce&#xD;
      hemiplegic shoulder pain. The specific aims are 1) to compare the effect of different&#xD;
      stimulation modes for shoulder pain reduction 2) to explore which patients will respond best&#xD;
      to these.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One challenging complication to stroke is the development of hemiplegic shoulder pain, which&#xD;
      is reported in approximately 30% of the stroke population. Treatment strategies recommended&#xD;
      in the Swedish National Guidelines for Stroke Care (NBHW) include use of assistive devices&#xD;
      for arm support and treatment with transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation (TENS), which&#xD;
      may impact on both pain and muscle tone. In an innovative approach, a full body suit with&#xD;
      multiple electrodes for provision off electrical stimulation has been developed by a small&#xD;
      Swedish med-tech company. The suit ( EXOPULSE Mollii suit) is currently used for treatment of&#xD;
      disabling spasticity and to improve motor function in persons living with effects of central&#xD;
      nervous system disease or injury. The theoretical background of the EXOPULSE Mollii-method&#xD;
      primarily refers to the concept of reciprocal inhibition, i.e. that sensory input from a&#xD;
      muscle may inhibit the activation of an antagonistic muscle. Thus, the application of&#xD;
      EXOPULSE Mollii aims at stimulating a muscle, e.g. the anterior tibial muscle of the lower&#xD;
      leg in order to reduce reflex mediated over-activity, i.e. spasticity, in calf muscles by&#xD;
      inducing reciprocal inhibition. Studies on the effects on spasticity and perceived usability&#xD;
      of the suit in a stroke population have recently been completed by our study group at the&#xD;
      Department of Rehabilitation Medicine Stockholm at Danderyd Hospital (dnr 2017/935-31) and&#xD;
      preliminary analyses indicate that spasticity may be reduced by use of the suit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the theoretical and practical background outlined above, this study will explore the&#xD;
      potential value of the Mollii-method in the management of post stroke shoulder pain. The&#xD;
      overall aim of this study is to test and further develop the Mollii-suit for its ability to&#xD;
      reduce hemiplegic shoulder pain. The specific aims are 1) to compare the effect of different&#xD;
      stimulation modes for shoulder pain reduction 2) to explore which patients will respond best&#xD;
      to these.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible participants will have suffered a stroke &gt; 6 months earlier and are living&#xD;
             with hemiplegia affecting the right or the left side of the body including the upper&#xD;
             extremity. They will have developed hemiplegic shoulder pain within the first 6 months&#xD;
             after stroke onset. Moreover, eligible study participants will be able to understand&#xD;
             instructions as well as written and oral study information and can express informed&#xD;
             consent. Furthermore, study participants need to pass the AbilityQ test (Turner-Stokes&#xD;
             2003) that assesses the cognitive ability to fill in a rating scale for pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exclusion criteria comprise any other disorder with an impact on sensorimotor&#xD;
             function, any other severe concomitant disease (such as cancer, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             inflammatory or psychiatric disease), uncontrolled epilepsy or blood pressure, major&#xD;
             surgery during the last year, any implanted medical devices, pregnancy, BMI&gt;35.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with ongoing pharmacological treatment for spasticity or pain may be included only&#xD;
        if the medication is stable since at least 3 months. Patients, who have been subject to&#xD;
        intramuscular treatment for spasticity may participate only if the time since last&#xD;
        treatment is 3 months or more and if it is anticipated that next treatment will not be&#xD;
        given during the study period.&#xD;
