  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DISCOVER randomized controlled trial is designed to evaluate the effect of automated&#xD;
      feedback after internet-based depression screening in individuals with undetected depression.&#xD;
      A total of 1076 individuals reporting elevated levels of depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10 points)&#xD;
      will be randomized into three groups to either receive a) no feedback (control group), b)&#xD;
      standardised or c) tailored feedback on their depression screening results.The primary&#xD;
      hypothesis is that feedback reduces depression severity six months after screening compared&#xD;
      to no feedback. The secondary hypothesis is that tailored feedback is more efficacious as&#xD;
      compared to standard feedback.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent condition associated with substantial&#xD;
      disease burden and economic costs. Still, it often remains undetected and untreated, which in&#xD;
      turn increases the likelihood of a chronic course, treatment resistance and rising healthcare&#xD;
      costs. One solution to address early detection and disease burden could be widely accessible&#xD;
      depression screening. Our previous trial in cardiac patients provides first evidence that&#xD;
      depression screening combined with written individual-targeted feedback on the screening&#xD;
      results improves depression severity and encourages greater patient participation and&#xD;
      engagement in mental health. To amplify these effects in a broader setting, the&#xD;
      internet-based DISCOVER randomized controlled trial (RCT) now aims at addressing affected but&#xD;
      yet undetected individuals on the internet. In order to evaluate the effect of feedback in&#xD;
      this setting, a total of 1076 individuals reporting elevated levels of depression (PHQ-9&#xD;
      score ≥ 10) will be randomized into three groups. They either receive a) no feedback (control&#xD;
      group), b) standardised or c) tailored feedback on their depression screening results. The&#xD;
      primary hypothesis is that feedback reduces depression severity six months after screening&#xD;
      compared to no feedback. The secondary hypothesis is that tailored feedback is more&#xD;
      efficacious as compared to standard feedback. Futher outcomes are guideline-based depression&#xD;
      care, depression-related help-seeking behaviour, a health economic evaluation, clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (somatic symptom severity and anxiety), health-related quality of life, illness&#xD;
      beliefs, intervention acceptance, depression diagnosis and adverse events.&#xD;
