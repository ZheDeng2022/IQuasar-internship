  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to assess the impact of three months' treatment with pre-/probiotic&#xD;
      mix on markers of nephropathy and other comorbidity related to diabetes. A double blinded,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled crossover, single-centre study including 46 patients with type&#xD;
      1 diabetes and albuminuria. The treatment period is 2 x 12 weeks with 6 weeks washout. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is to evaluate the effect of pre-/probiotic mix on albuminuria.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent data has pointed towards a link between gut microbiota and chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD). It is hypothesized that defects in the intestinal barrier due to intestinal dysbiosis,&#xD;
      a microbial imbalance in the intestines, allow bacterial toxins and other proinflammatory&#xD;
      substances to pass and cause systemic inflammation that damages the endothelium. To&#xD;
      reestablish the microbial symbiosis and thereby strengthening the gut barrier different&#xD;
      treatments have been investigated. Fibers serve as substrate for the beneficial bacterial&#xD;
      strains and probiotics are selected bacteria that exert a beneficial effect on the gut&#xD;
      environment. It is hypothesized that a supplement of fructo-oligosaccharides and probiotics&#xD;
      (Pre-/probiotic mix) will strengthen the gut barrier and thereby protect the endothelium and&#xD;
      kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to test whether af Pre-/probiotic mix, will have a beneficial impact&#xD;
      on albuminuria in persons with type 1 diabetes and albuminuria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      46 patients with type 1 diabetes and albuminuria will be recruited from Steno Diabetes Center&#xD;
      Copenhagen (SDCC) in accordance with the study in- and exclusion criteria.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in albuminuria based on urinary albumin-creatinine ratio (UACR)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 weeks. Samples will be collected before and after each og te two treatment periods.</time_frame>
    <description>Three morning urine samples will be collected for assessment of UACR. The geometric mean of the 3 samples will be calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in kidney function (GFR as plasma clearance of 99mTc-DTPA)</measure>
    <time_frame>30 weeks. 99mTc-DTPA GFR will be performed after each of the two treatment periods.</time_frame>
    <description>Renal function (GFR) and extracellular volume (ECV) will be assessed during 4 hours with the measurement plasma clearance of 99mTc-DTPA to provide accurate GFR measurement. A bolus of 0.5 mL Technetium-99m DTPA (approximately 10 MBq) is injected and blood samples are drawn at 0, 180, 200, 220 and 240 minutes after the injection. Urine is collected during the investigation. Plasma concentrations of 99mTc-DTPA at these time points are measured and used to calculate the plasma clearance of 99mTc-DTPA which approximates GFR.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in 24-hour blood pressure</measure>
    <time_frame>30 weeks. 24h BP will be performed after each of the two treatment periods.</time_frame>
    <description>24-hours blood pressure will be measured using a standard cuff-based device (boso TM-2430 PC2) that measures the blood pressure every 15 minutes between 07 in the morning and 23 in the evening and every 30 minutes during the night.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in microcirculation evaluated by the GlycoCheck device</measure>
    <time_frame>30 weeks. GlycoCheck will be performed before and after each of the two treatment periods.</time_frame>
    <description>GlycoCheck is a handheld video capillary microscope that measure glycocalyx thickness and sublingual capillary density under the tongue. The measurement will be performed by investigator and is a measure of the microcirculation damage. The distribution of the red blood cell column width at each capillary segment is used to calculate the perfused boundary region, which is the distance between the median and the outer edge of the red blood cell perfused lumen. The perfused boundary region reflects the thickness of the endothelial glycocalyx, based on the idea that loss of its integrity allows deeper penetration of the red blood cells into the gel-like layer covering the endothelial lining. Higher perfused boundary region, therefore, indicates thinner glycocalyx. The software also returns total and perfused capillary density in segments per millimeter square.</description>
