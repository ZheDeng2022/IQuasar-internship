    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will collect clinical information as well as complete the&#xD;
      following procedures to assess central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system&#xD;
      (PNS) involvement: neuroimaging with MRI, MRS and DTI; needle electromyography with&#xD;
      electromyography, quantitative muscle ultrasound, nerve conduction study, small fiber&#xD;
      neuropathy screening list (SFNSL) and skin biopsy depending on SFNSL score; cognition and&#xD;
      developmental assessments including an audiological exam; physical therapy and speech&#xD;
      evaluation. These assessments will be collected once a year for up to six years.&#xD;
