      To evaluate the following items by PET examination in Japanese heathy adult male subjects who&#xD;
      received single oral administration of TS-091 in an unblinded manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Relationship between plasma concentration and H3 receptor-occupancy of TS-091&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Time course changes in H3 receptor-occupancy of TS-091&#xD;
