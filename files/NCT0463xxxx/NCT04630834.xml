  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the pediatric emergency department (PED), acute traumatic and nontraumatic pain accounts&#xD;
      for approximately 9% of ED visits. The initial drugs of choice for analgesia are typically&#xD;
      ibuprofen or acetaminophen. Both drugs display analgesic and antipyretic effects via distinct&#xD;
      mechanisms of action. Various meta-analyses in the literature have compared ibuprofen and&#xD;
      acetaminophen for pain relief in adults and children. Ibuprofen has been shown to be very&#xD;
      effective for mild to moderate pain, especially in musculoskeletal injuries, including some&#xD;
      limb fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination of analgesics with different modes of action have the potential to offer enhanced&#xD;
      pain relief with reduced dosage. Ibuprofen and acetaminophen have different modes of action.&#xD;
      Ibuprofen is an NSAID that inhibits the activity of cyclooxygenase-1 and cyclooxygenase-2&#xD;
      enzymes and blocks the synthesis of prostaglandins and thromboxanes. The mode of action of&#xD;
      acetaminophen for its analgesic effects is not entirely understood. It is thought that its&#xD;
      effects are mediated through serotonergic pathways, cannabinoid and nitric oxide synthase,&#xD;
      substance P, and N-methyl-D-aspartate. Combination of ibuprofen and acetaminophen has shown&#xD;
      enhanced analgesia in adult studies, with pediatric data limited to post-operative pain and&#xD;
      dental pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data is limited regarding the combination of acetaminophen and ibuprofen for acute pain&#xD;
      in the PED. A recent study showed similar analgesic efficacy of oral ibuprofen and&#xD;
      acetaminophen in comparison with each analgesic alone for short-term treatment of acute pain&#xD;
      in the PED7. In this study, pain reassessment was limited to only one time point at 60&#xD;
      minutes and included patients with pain scores of 1 on a 10 point scale. Since there is ample&#xD;
      data demonstrating the effectiveness of ibuprofen for pain, we will investigate whether the&#xD;
      combination of ibuprofen plus acetaminophen is superior for moderate to severe pain reduction&#xD;
      compared to ibuprofen alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To evaluate the analgesic efficacy of oral acetaminophen plus ibuprofen versus&#xD;
      ibuprofen plus placeboalone for the management of acute pain in a pediatric emergency&#xD;
      department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The combination of oral acetaminophen and ibuprofen is superior to ibuprofen&#xD;
      alone for the reduction of acute traumatic and nontraumatic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This will be a prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial,&#xD;
      conducted in the pediatric emergency department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Recruitment Patients ages 3 years through 20 years who present to the PED with&#xD;
      traumatic and/or nontraumatic pain will be assessed for eligibility. Pain assessment will be&#xD;
      performed by a study investigator upon presentation at triage before medication&#xD;
      administration. A validated numeric pain score (11-point 0-10 scale) will be used for&#xD;
      patients 8 through 20 years. The Wong-Baker FACES Pain Scale (11-point 0-10 scale) will be&#xD;
      used for patients ages 3 through 7 years. If the patient is eligible for enrollment, details&#xD;
      of the study will be discussed with parent and/or patient and consent/assent will be obtained&#xD;
      if they agree to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female patients &gt;12 years will be assessed for pregnancy with a point of care urine HCG test.&#xD;
      Pregnant patients will be excluded. Patients found to be pregnant will not be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study and will be given appropriate care as is our standard procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Intervention Study participants will be randomized to one of two treatment groups&#xD;
      according to predetermined block randomization. A clinical research pharmacist will prepare&#xD;
      placebo and acetaminophen in identical 20 mL amber bottles labeled sequentially. The bottle,&#xD;
      5, 10 and 20 mL amber syringes, and study documents will be stored in individual sequentially&#xD;
      numbered manilla envelopes in a locked cabinet in the PED medication room. A nurse will draw&#xD;
      the appropriate weight-based dose of placebo or medication into the amber syringes and&#xD;
      administer the placebo or medication to the patient. Additionally, the nurse will administer&#xD;
      a weight based dose of ibuprofen to each study participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The placebo group will receive a single weight-based dose of oral ibuprofen (100mg/5mL) at&#xD;
      10mg/kg to a maximum of 600 mg and placebo, mirrored as acetaminophen concentration of&#xD;
      160mg/5mL, at 15mg/kg to a maximum of 20 mL. The intervention group will receive a&#xD;
      weight-based dose of ibuprofen (100mg/5mL) at 10mg/kg to a maximum of 600 mg and a dose of&#xD;
      acetaminophen (160mg/5mL) at 15mg/kg to a maximum of 20 mL (650mg). The patient will then be&#xD;
      evaluated in a standard manner by a treating clinician. The study investigator will reassess&#xD;
      the pain score at 1 hour and 2 hours after medication administration. At the discretion of&#xD;
      the treating physician, patients will receive parenteral medications at any time during the&#xD;
      two hour assessment period for increasing or unremitting pain. Patients who are ready for&#xD;
      discharge before the two hour pain assessment will receive a final pain score by the study&#xD;
      investigator with documentation of time of the reassessment. Adverse events during the&#xD;
      assessment period will be documented on a data collection sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject treatment assignments will remain blinded until the final subject has completed&#xD;
      follow up and all data has been recorded and validated. Urgent, immediate unblinding due to&#xD;
      medical emergency may be authorized by the Investigator. When possible, the treatment&#xD;
      assignment will be provided to the treating physician in order to maintain the blind for the&#xD;
      Investigator and study staff. All instances of subject unblinding will be documented in the&#xD;
      study record&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent Written informed consent will be obtained by a study investigator at triage before&#xD;
      initiation of treatment. An informed consent will be obtained parent or legal guardian for&#xD;
      all patients 17 years and younger. Patients ages 13 years and older will sign an informed&#xD;
      consent and an assent will be obtained from patients 7 years to 12 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are in pain and are first approached at the time the protocol will be initiated&#xD;
      must be capable of providing contemporaneous informed consent. The principal investigator or&#xD;
      study investigator will assess the capacity of the patient to provide ethically adequate&#xD;
      informed consent. If the patient has capacity and consents to participation these facts will&#xD;
      be documented in the patient's research record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality All patient data and research records will be kept confidential. Data&#xD;
      collection sheets will be stored in a locked cabinet in the principal investigator's locked&#xD;
      office throughout the study period and will be accessible only to research staff. Data will&#xD;
      be collected on paper forms then entered into a password protected computer database. After&#xD;
      data collection is performed, identifiers will be removed from the data file. Research&#xD;
      investigators responsible for study collection, nurses, study participants and clinicians&#xD;
      providing care to the patient in the emergency department will be blinded to the medication&#xD;
      received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits The potential benefit of combined acetaminophen and ibuprofen therapy may provide an&#xD;
      increased reduction in acute pain, improved patient comfort and patient/parent satisfaction&#xD;
      compared to ibuprofen administered as a single agent. Enhanced pain reduction may potentially&#xD;
      obviate the need for parenteral pain medication, including opioids. An additional benefit is&#xD;
      the opportunity to contribute to research regarding pain management in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks This study may involve slightly more than minimal risk. Risk of participation in this&#xD;
      study may be failure of combination therapy to potentiate pain reduction. Since patients will&#xD;
      be randomized into treatment or placebo groups, they will not have the ability to choose a&#xD;
      treatment option. Acetaminophen can be given at any age, however, there is a risk of liver&#xD;
      toxicity in overdose. Ibuprofen has common side effects of gastrointestinal and renal effects&#xD;
      including gastric irritation and acute renal injury. These risks, however, are considered to&#xD;
      be minimal the medications are given as a single weight-based dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Baseline and post-treatment pain scores at 1 and 2 hours will be documented.&#xD;
      Categorical data will be compared using the chi-squared test. Continuous data will be&#xD;
      compared using the Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed data and t-test for&#xD;
      normally distributed data. For our sample size calculation, we made the following&#xD;
      assumptions: previous studies investigating pain scores in children have reported a decrease&#xD;
      in pain score of 1 on a 10-point scale to be clinically significant. For this study, we&#xD;
      assumed that a decrease in pain score of 2 would be clinically relevant. We used a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 3 for our sample size calculation. We also assumed a 20% dropout rate and&#xD;
      increased our sample size estimate by 15% to account for nonparametric data. Based on these&#xD;
      assumptions, for our primary outcome, we estimated 50 patients would be needed in each group&#xD;
      to have a power of 80% with an alpha of 0.05 to detect a difference of 2 in pain score&#xD;
      between the two groups, with a standard deviation of 3. Data analyses of the pain scores will&#xD;
      be based on the principle of intention to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single site study involving a biochemical intervention that presents slightly more&#xD;
      than minimal risk due potential adverse effects from medication and randomized design.&#xD;
      Close-monitoring will be performed by the study investigator and co-investigator every other&#xD;
      month, or every 20 patients enrolled, whichever is more frequent. The specific procedures&#xD;
      that will be used to monitor for and report adverse events, protocol violations and&#xD;
      deviations are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data will be analyzed for participant recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Data quality and protocol adherence, as determined by completeness of forms&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Protocol adherence as determined by times of drug administration and pain assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of informed consent process and documentation as determined by review of all&#xD;
           forms for valid signatures and times&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Analysis of adverse effects of medication determined by rates of such events as&#xD;
           identified on data collection forms&#xD;
