      The purpose of this study is to collect long-term safety and tolerability data of LCZ696 and&#xD;
      to provide open-label LCZ696 to eligible participants who completed CLCZ696G2301 study&#xD;
      (PARADISE-MI) if LCZ696 is shown to have a positive benefit-risk profile in comparison to&#xD;
      ramipril in reducing risk of cardiovascular (CV) mortality and development of heart failure&#xD;
      in participants enrolled in the PARADISE-MI study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a multicenter, open-label extension study following-up to PARADISE-MI, which evaluated the efficacy and safety of LCZ696 compared to ramipril, in reducing the occurrence of CV death, heart failure (HF) hospitalization and outpatient HF (time-to-first event analysis) in post-acute myocardial infarction (AMI) patients with evidence of left ventricular (LV) systolic dysfunction and/or pulmonary congestion, without a known prior history of chronic HF. The study duration is up to approximately 24 months with visits at Days -14 to 1, 1, 15, 29 and Months 3, 6, 12, 18, and 24. Participants will receive LCZ696 at maximally tolerated doses with a target dose of 200 mg twice daily at all visits between day 1 and the last visit.</intervention_model_description>
