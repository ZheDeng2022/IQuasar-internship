  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Depression and anxiety in patients with breast cancer are serious comorbidities that affect&#xD;
      the quality of life for patients and their survival rates as they have poorer health&#xD;
      outcomes. This validation study is a part of the study on the prevalence of depression and&#xD;
      anxiety among breast cancer patients. This study aims to investigate the validity of the&#xD;
      Kazakh and Russian versions of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) and Beck Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory (BAI) among breast cancer patients in Almaty, Kazakhstan.&#xD;

    <measure>BDI-II Score at Baseline:</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) Scale is a 21-item self-reported questionnaire which measures the existence and severity of symptoms of depression. Each of the 21 items on BDI-II tool represents a depressive symptom. The symptoms are each scored on a 4-point Likert scale of 0 to 3 (0=symptom is absent; 3=symptom is severe). Scores for each symptom are added up to obtain the total scores for all 21 items. Total score ranges from 0-63; of which 0-8 is considered no depression, 0-13 is minimal depression, 14-19 is mild depression, 20-28 is moderate depression and 29-63 is severe depression.</description>
