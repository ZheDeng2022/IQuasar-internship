  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a prospective, randomized, controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      to assess the utility of IONM in patients undergoing primary, single or multilevel lateral&#xD;
      spinal procedures. Subjects will be randomized to undergo a lateral spine surgery with the&#xD;
      use of NeuroVision® IONM or conventional hospital based IONM to assess incidence of new-onset&#xD;
      neurological injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elective spinal surgery for the correction of degenerative spinal pathology may involve&#xD;
      significant intraoperative risks that can influence postoperative neurologic outcomes. Spinal&#xD;
      cord monitoring had made it possible to track the spine and nerve root sensory and motor&#xD;
      tracts. This has improved the ability to conduct minimally invasive surgery by allowing&#xD;
      surgeons to operate without direct visualization of the neurologic elements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative neuromonitoring (IONM) of the spinal cord is primarily accomplished by both&#xD;
      somatosensory evoked potentials (SSEP) and transcranial motor evoked potentials (tcMEPs). Due&#xD;
      to a shortage in personnel trained to evaluate neuro-monitoring results, surgeon-driven&#xD;
      systems have been established. An example of a surgeon driven monitoring system is&#xD;
      NeuroVision®, which interacts with the surgeon during the operation by providing real-time&#xD;
      visible and auditory tcMEP and compound muscle action potential (CMAP) waveforms. This stands&#xD;
      in comparison to hospital based methods of IONM.&#xD;
