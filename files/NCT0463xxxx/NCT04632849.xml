  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      GEM (Glycemic Excursion Minimization) is a new lifestyle treatment for type 2 diabetes that&#xD;
      aims to lower glucose levels after meals and snacks. This is different from the current&#xD;
      lifestyle treatment, which is to lose weight. This study is trying to find out if people who&#xD;
      are newly diagnosed with type 2 diabetes can use a continuous glucose monitor together with&#xD;
      the GEM lifestyle to improve control of their diabetes. Study participants will follow the&#xD;
      GEM lifestyle for 4 months (1 month of treatment and 3 months of maintenance) instead of&#xD;
      seeking usual care (medications or weight loss programs) to lower blood glucose.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For people who are newly diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), it might be possible to delay&#xD;
      or prevent the need for diabetic medications by reducing postprandial glucose (PPG). Our&#xD;
      Glycemic Excursion Minimization (GEM) lifestyle intervention can reduce PPG, but it depends&#xD;
      on blood glucose feedback to help the user learn what elevates their PPG. This study examines&#xD;
      if continuous feedback from the Libre 2 continuous glucose monitor (CGM) will be advantageous&#xD;
      for reaching the goals of GEM. We will recruit 18 adult participants newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes who are interested in using the Libre 2 CGM. Six participants will be&#xD;
      recruited from each of the primary care clinics at the University of Virginia (Dr. Cox), the&#xD;
      University of Colorado (Dr. Oser) and the University of West Virginia, East Branch (Dr.&#xD;
      Cucuzzella). Each site will also search their medical records to select 4 participants who&#xD;
      match their study participants, meet the study criteria, but are being treated with routine&#xD;
      care. These data will form the Routine Care control group (n=12). Routine Care participants&#xD;
      will follow their doctor's treatment recommendations, while GEM participants will complete&#xD;
      the 1-month, self-directed GEM lifestyle training using the Libre 2 CGM and a FitBit to&#xD;
      monitor progress. They will then maintain the GEM lifestyle for 3 more months. The Total&#xD;
      Treatment Effect (a measure of treatment effectiveness that considers both A1c and medication&#xD;
      changes) will be calculated pre- and post-treatment from medical record data. CGM data from&#xD;
      GEM participants will be collected and analyzed. CGM sensor use will be tracked to estimate&#xD;
      participant engagement. We anticipate this multi-center pilot project will demonstrate the&#xD;
      benefits of using Libre 2 with a structured lifestyle intervention designed to reduce&#xD;
      postprandial blood glucose excursions for individuals newly diagnosed with T2D.&#xD;
