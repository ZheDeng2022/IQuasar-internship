  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The conventional examination of the visual acuity (VA) does not take into account the&#xD;
      patient's reading speed. However, the consideration of the speed for the recognition of the&#xD;
      VA charts' symbols leads to the more accurate and comprehensive assessment of the visual&#xD;
      capacity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, primary objective of this study is to develop and validate a new parameter for the&#xD;
      more comprehensive evaluation of visual capacity: the critical visual acuity (CVA). CVA takes&#xD;
      into account the speed of recognition of the symbols of the distance visual charts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In clinical practice, the conventional examination of the VA does not take into account the&#xD;
      patient's reading speed, and does not reflect the requirements of everyday life (e.g.&#xD;
      driving, watching subtitles on TV), in which each individual has limited time to react. In&#xD;
      addition, the VA measured with the conventional method differs significantly among the&#xD;
      different examiners, since there is no standard time limit for the patient to read the chart&#xD;
      symbols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the consideration of the speed for the recognition of the VA charts' symbols leads&#xD;
      to the more accurate and comprehensive assessment of the visual capacity. Therefore, primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to develop and validate a new parameter for the more comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluation of visual capacity: the critical visual acuity (CVA), and to determine normal&#xD;
      values of population according to age. CVA takes into account the speed of recognition of the&#xD;
      symbols of the distance visual charts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are recruited from the outpatient service of the Department of Ophthalmology of&#xD;
      the University Hospital of Alexandroupolis in a consecutive-if-eligible basis. At first, each&#xD;
      participant performs the conventional VA test monocularly. Then, he/she performs the CVA test&#xD;
      with the same eye. Two different printed Landolt ring charts are used, the first one for VA&#xD;
      and the second one for CVA assessment for all participants to avoid memorization. The VA and&#xD;
      CVA are evaluated for all participants under the same environmental lighting conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding the VA and CVA examination procedure, the investigator masks the chart lines using&#xD;
      a blank piece of paper and reveals one line each time. The investigator instructs the patient&#xD;
      to read aloud the 5 letters of the Landolt chart, as quickly and accurately as possible,&#xD;
      after hearing the words &quot;Ready!â€¦ Go!&quot;. At the same time, a second examiner starts a stopwatch&#xD;
      to record the reading time (in seconds, to the nearest 0.01 s) when the examiner fully&#xD;
      reveals the line and the patient starts to read it. The first examiner counts the number of&#xD;
      errors for each line and the second one enters the reading time for each line in a data file.&#xD;
      The reading time of each line is compared with the automatically calculated average reading&#xD;
      time of the larger lines minus 1.96 (for CVA) or 2.58 (for VA) times the standard deviation&#xD;
      (SD) of the reading time of these lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing stops when the letters are too small for the examinee to discriminate and/or they are&#xD;
      read with a speed lower than the maximum reading speed (MRS) of each examinee.&#xD;
