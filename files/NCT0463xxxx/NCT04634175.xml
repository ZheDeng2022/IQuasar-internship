      Mind-body intervention as a complementary and integrative treatment for compulsive sexual&#xD;
      behavior disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that participants with CSBD, after being submitted to the protocol of the&#xD;
      mind-body intervention group in relation to those submitted to the intervention protocol Shan&#xD;
      of the control group, present less severe sexual compulsiveness.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mind-body intervention practice as a complementary and integrative treatment for compulsive&#xD;
      sexual behavior disorder, a randomized clinical trial, in a sample of male individuals who&#xD;
      spontaneously seek treatment at the Psychiatry Institute of Hospital das Clínicas, University&#xD;
      of São Paulo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The volunteers with CSBD will be randomized by statistical software in two groups, mind-body&#xD;
      intervention and Shan intervention, to participate in a twelve-week program of daily&#xD;
      practices of the mind-body practices protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be evaluated by measuring instruments at time 1 (4th week), time 2 (8th&#xD;
      week) and time 3 (12th week).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the effectiveness of mind-body&#xD;
      intervention in decreasing the symptoms (sexual compulsiveness) of the CSBD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are to investigate the effectiveness of the mind-body&#xD;
      intervention in reducing the severity of impulsivity, hypersexuality, anxiety, depression,&#xD;
      improving the level of quality of life, increasing adherence to total treatment, regulating&#xD;
      sexual inhibition, sexual arousal and decrease the severity of sexual dysfunction.&#xD;
