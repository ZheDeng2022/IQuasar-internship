      Neoadjuvant plus adjuvant treatment with immunotherapy may have an anti-tumor activity and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of relapse in patients with high risk surgically resectable stage III&#xD;
      cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (CSCC) is the second most common skin cancer in US. It is&#xD;
      associated with a surgical cure rate &gt;95% in early stage disease but a small percentage of&#xD;
      patients develop unresectable locally advanced or metastatic CSCC. The 2018 FDA approval of&#xD;
      Libtayo was based on a combined analysis of data from an open-label, multi-center,&#xD;
      non-randomized Phase 2 trial known as EMPOWER-CSCC-1 (Study 1540) and two advanced CSCC&#xD;
      expansion cohorts from a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized Phase 1 trial (Study 1423).&#xD;
      Conventional cytotoxic chemotherapy can induce tumor responses but is often poorly tolerated,&#xD;
      specially among older patients with CSCC. CSCC has higher mutation burden than any tumor type&#xD;
      and immunosuppression is a known risk factor. Furthermore, PD-L1 expression has been&#xD;
      associated with high risk disease1 suggesting that CSCC may be responsive to PD-1 checkpoint&#xD;
      blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cemiplimab is a human anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody, under study for patients with&#xD;
      unresectable locally advanced and/or regionally or metastatic CSCC. It has been studied in a&#xD;
      phase I dose escalation, where a durable radiologic complete response was achieved in CSCC&#xD;
      patients.2-3 In this study, the partial response was 25% in locally advanced and 60% in&#xD;
      metastatic CSCC,stable disease was 31.3% in locally advanced and 10% in metastatic CSCC,&#xD;
      progressive disease was 25% in locally advanced and 20% in metastatic CSCC with an overall&#xD;
      response rate of 46.2% and a disease control rate of 69.2%. The 2018 FDA approval of Libtayo&#xD;
      was based on a combined analysis of data from an open-label, multi-center, non-randomized&#xD;
      Phase 2 trial known as EMPOWER-CSCC-1 (Study 1540) and two advanced CSCC expansion cohorts&#xD;
      from a multi-center, open-label, non-randomized Phase 1 trial (Study 1423). Together, the&#xD;
      trials represent the largest prospective data set in advanced CSCC. The major efficacy&#xD;
      outcome measures for the integrated analysis of EMPOWER-CSCC-1 and the two CSCC expansion&#xD;
      cohorts were confirmed objective response rate (ORR), as assessed by independent central&#xD;
      review (ICR), and ICR-assessed duration of response (DOR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Across the entire population, the overall response rate (ORR) at a median follow-up of 8.9&#xD;
      months was 47% (95% CI, 38-47). The complete response (CR) rate was 4% and the partial&#xD;
      response (PR) rate was 44%. The duration of response ranged from 1 month to over 15 months.&#xD;
      Sixty-one percent of patients had a duration of response ≥6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among 75 patients with metastatic CSCC, the ORR was 47% (95% CI, 35-59). The CR rate was 5%&#xD;
      and the PR rate was 41%. The duration of response ranged from 3 months to over 15 months.&#xD;
      Sixty percent of patients had a duration of response ≥6 months. In the 33 patients with&#xD;
      locally advanced disease, the ORR was 49% (95% CI, 31-67), comprising all PRs. The duration&#xD;
      of response ranged from 1 month to over 13 months. Sixty-three percent of patients had a&#xD;
      duration of response ≥6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cemiplimab therefore produced rapid, deep and durable tumor reductions in target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cemiplimab appears to be active regardless PD-L1 expressione in the tumor and no apparent&#xD;
      association between PD-L1 IHC results and objective responses was determined. Cemiplimab was&#xD;
      generally well tolerated in CSCC, and most commonly associated with fatigue (23.1%&#xD;
      prevalence), arthralgia, rash maculopapular, diarrhea, nausea, hypothyroidism (7.7%) of any&#xD;
      grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantage of neoadjuvant trials is the availability of blood and tumor tissue samples&#xD;
      before and after systemic therapy for the conduct of novel mechanistic and biomarker studies&#xD;
      in the circulation and the tumor microenvironment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the available results to date, the investigators aim to conduct a phase II single&#xD;
      arm trial to define the role of neoadjuvant plus adjuvant immunotherapy in patients with&#xD;
      stage III CSCC. This approach has the potential to define whether neoadjuvant treatment with&#xD;
      cemiplimab has antitumor activity and whether it reduces the risk of relapse after surgery.&#xD;
