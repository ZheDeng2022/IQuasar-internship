  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to compare the safety and efficacy of 0.25% HBM9036 (HL036)&#xD;
      Ophthalmic Solution to placebo for the treatment of the Chinese subjects with moderate and&#xD;
      severe dry eye.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitors for tumor necrosis factor (TNF) have been widely used in clinical practice. Such&#xD;
      class of medications have been approved for rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis, and&#xD;
      uveitis. HBM9036 (HL036) is a molecularly engineered TNFR1 fragment, and molecule&#xD;
      fragmentation and engineering techniques are applied for enhanced tissue distribution,&#xD;
      increased stability and potency. In multiple early stage studies including preclinical&#xD;
      studies, HBM9036 (HL036) has demonstrated the safety and efficacy in the therapy for moderate&#xD;
      and severe dry eye. As a phase 3 confirmational study, this study is to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of 0.25% HBM9036 (HL036) ophthalmic solution compared to placebo in Chinese&#xD;
      subjects with moderate and severe dry eye.&#xD;
