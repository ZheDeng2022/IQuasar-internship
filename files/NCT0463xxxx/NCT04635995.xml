  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      LVGN7409 is a humanized monoclonal antibody that specifically binds to CD40, and acts as an&#xD;
      agonist against CD40.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first in human study of LVGN7409 is designed to establish the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) and/or the recommended dose for expansion (RDE) as well as the recommended Phase 2&#xD;
      dose(s) (RP2D) of LVGN7409, both as a single agent (monotherapy) and in combination with a&#xD;
      fixed dose of anti-PD-1 antibody and/or CD137 agonist in the treatment of advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic malignancy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, two-stage, FIH Phase 1 study, utilizing an accelerated&#xD;
      dose escalation followed by a traditional 3 + 3 dose escalation algorithm to identify the MTD&#xD;
      and/or RDE and RP2D of LVGN7409 as a single agent (monotherapy) and in combination with&#xD;
      anti-PD-1 antibody and/or CD137 agonist. The first stage of the study is the dose escalation&#xD;
      phase (i.e., Phase 1a). The second stage of the study is the dose expansion phase (i.e.,&#xD;
      Phase 1b). During the study, dose interruption(s) and/or delay(s) may be implemented based on&#xD;
      toxicity. Dose modifications are not permitted. Intra-patient dose escalations will be&#xD;
      allowed for the early dose cohorts (single-patient dose groups) in Phase 1a Part 1. Patients&#xD;
      will be considered evaluable for safety and tolerability if they receive at least one dose of&#xD;
      LVGN7409 or anti-PD-1 antibody and/or CD137 agonist at the specified cohort dose. Patients in&#xD;
      all parts of the trial will remain on therapy until confirmed disease progression or for 2&#xD;
      years, whichever occurs first. However, patients who are clinically unstable will discontinue&#xD;
      following the initial assessment of disease progression.&#xD;
