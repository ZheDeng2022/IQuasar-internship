  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this randomized controlled trial is to compare two different strategies of&#xD;
      postoperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) management (manual versus automated) in patients&#xD;
      who underwent a major surgery and admitted in the intensive care unit or post-anesthesia care&#xD;
      unit for postoperative care. The investigators hypothesis is that the automated group will&#xD;
      spend more time in a predetermined target MAP range of 80-90 mmHg compared to the manual&#xD;
      group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the correction of hypotension during the perioperative period should be a key goal,&#xD;
      approximately 40% of overall mortality is still closely linked to the presence of&#xD;
      perioperative hypotension which is responsible for significant morbidity particularly in&#xD;
      patients undergoing major surgery. Indeed, inadequate management of perioperative hypotension&#xD;
      remains an undeniable risk factor for morbidity and mortality. However, management of&#xD;
      perioperative mean arterial pressure (MAP) is still suboptimal today. Indeed, the analysis of&#xD;
      our database demonstrates that, on average, patient spends only 50-60 % of the treatment time&#xD;
      within the predetermined MAP target. In about 10% of the treatment time, the patient is&#xD;
      under-treated (hypotension) and 30% of the time, the patient is over-treated (hypertension).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The correction of hypotension is achieved using vasopressor drugs (mainly norepinephrine&#xD;
      infusion). In 2017 a study published in the JAMA shows that patients with tightly controlled&#xD;
      arterial pressure have fewer organ dysfunctions than those with standard blood pressure&#xD;
      management. However, maintaining MAP within a narrow range involves regular manual&#xD;
      adjustments of norepinephrine infusion doses by intensive care unit nurses. When a&#xD;
      hypotension occurs, there is usually two main possible treatments (fluid or vasopressors). In&#xD;
      the operating room, for patients undergoing major surgery, we usually optimize fluid and&#xD;
      vasopressor titration using an advanced hemodynamic monitoring device &quot;EV1000 monitor&quot;&#xD;
      (Edwards Lifesciences, Irvine USA).This monitoring device can also be connected to a computer&#xD;
      that controls a norepinephrine infusion pump in order to tightly adjust the infusion of&#xD;
      norepinephrine to the target MAP predetermined by the clinician in charge of the patients. We&#xD;
      have recently demonstrated that the use of such system resulted in less intraoperative time&#xD;
      in hypotension compared to manual management. However, in the postoperative period, in&#xD;
      patients admitted in the intensive care unit after a major surgery and requiring tight&#xD;
      control of MAP, such demonstration is still lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the objective of this randomized controlled superiority study is to demonstrate&#xD;
      that, in patients admitted to intensive care unit or post-anesthesia care unit after a major&#xD;
      surgery, tight control of MAP using a closed-loop system for vasopressor administration will&#xD;
      result in MAP being more often within a predetermined MAP range of 80-90 mmHg compared to the&#xD;
      same management without this automated closed-loop system (nurse adjustment of vasopressor&#xD;
      administration).&#xD;
