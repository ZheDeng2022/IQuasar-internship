      This study will create a Breast Cancer Clinical Decision Support Module in MeTree and&#xD;
      validate and pilot the Breast Cancer Clinical Decision Support Module in a clinical setting&#xD;
      within SingHealth. This proposal leverages the larger collaborative work already started to&#xD;
      explore clinically meaningful applications of MeTree within SingHealth. While MeTree has been&#xD;
      shown to be clinically effective within primary care clinics in the U.S., SingHealth's&#xD;
      oncologists are interested in leveraging MeTree's risk assessment features both to establish&#xD;
      a more organized, standardized, and systematic process for collecting information to enhance&#xD;
      cancer management and to maximize the advances in precision medicine for the benefit of&#xD;
      cancer patients. Therefore, in collaboration with SingHealth oncologist Dr.Ngeow, the&#xD;
      principal investigators propose to explore, develop, and pilot a prototype MeTree cancer&#xD;
      module.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The value of precision medicine within clinical care is becoming increasingly more evident.&#xD;
      Nowhere is this clearer than in the field of oncology. With recognition of the value of&#xD;
      genetics in clinical care, the National Cancer Centre Singapore (NCCS) established a Cancer&#xD;
      Genetics Service in 2006. This service performs a valuable function within NCCS by overseeing&#xD;
      the care of patients found to have hereditary cancer syndromes and providing consultation to&#xD;
      clinical oncologists on the appropriate, targeted role of genetic testing within cancer care.&#xD;
      While the Cancer Genetics Service is available to all clinicians within NCCS, with the&#xD;
      continually growing and evolving understanding of how genetics plays a role in cancer and&#xD;
      cancer treatment, there are no clear, consistent guidelines on when to request consultation.&#xD;
      This leads to both over- and underutilization of services with some patients being referred&#xD;
      who do not require it and others being missed whose care would benefit from the expertise of&#xD;
      a cancer geneticist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to address these inconsistencies in care, the study team proposes to further&#xD;
      develop and evaluate the implementation of a Duke-developed precision medicine software&#xD;
      program, MeTree, within NCCS breast cancer clinics. MeTree is a patient-facing family history&#xD;
      based risk assessment tool and clinical decision aid that was developed by researchers within&#xD;
      Duke's Center for Applied Genomics and Precision Medicine (CAGPM). The initial intent of&#xD;
      MeTree was to assist clinicians in identifying patients at greater than population risk based&#xD;
      on a number of clinical and family health history (FHH) factors for a range of common&#xD;
      conditions (including cancer) and provide clinical decision support (CDS) with specific&#xD;
      recommendations based on common U.S. guidelines for prevention and screening.MeTree has been&#xD;
      thoroughly tested and validated and is currently being implemented across five U.S.&#xD;
      healthcare systems by way of a large cooperative grant through NHGRI's IGNITE network.2-7 Dr.&#xD;
      Orlando is co-PI of this study and Dr. Wu served as a site PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the efforts of Drs. Wu and Orlando, among others, a research agreement was recently&#xD;
      signed between Duke University and the National Heart Center Singapore (NHCS) to allow&#xD;
      testing of MeTree within a cardiovascular epidemiologic study, the Biobank study&#xD;
      (MeTree-Biobank pilot). The Biobank study is providing data to the SPECTRA healthy population&#xD;
      database developed by the SingHealth/Duke-NUS Institute of Precision Medicine (PRISM).&#xD;
      SPECTRA aims to collect detailed phenotypic and genomic information on 5,000 healthy&#xD;
      Singaporeans. MeTree will be used to collect detailed FHH on Biobank participants. This&#xD;
      collaboration is part of a larger partnership between CAGPM and PRISM to further develop&#xD;
      cross-institution collaborations. Enrollment in the Biobank study is currently underway and&#xD;
      incorporation of MeTree into the data capture flow started June 2017.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proposal leverages the larger collaborative work already started to explore clinically&#xD;
      meaningful applications of MeTree within SingHealth. While MeTree has been shown to be&#xD;
      clinically effective within primary care clinics in the U.S., SingHealth's oncologists are&#xD;
      interested in leveraging MeTree's risk assessment features both to establish a more&#xD;
      organized, standardized, and systematic process for collecting information to enhance cancer&#xD;
      management and to maximize the advances in precision medicine for the benefit of cancer&#xD;
      patients. Therefore, in collaboration with SingHealth oncologist Dr. Ngeow, the principal&#xD;
      investigators propose to explore, develop, and pilot a prototype MeTree cancer module through&#xD;
      the following two aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Create a Breast Cancer Clinical Decision Support Module in MeTree Specific&#xD;
      Aim 2: Validate and Pilot the Breast Cancer Clinical Decision Support Module in a clinical&#xD;
      setting within SingHealth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      APPROACH Specific Aim 1: Create a Breast Cancer Clinical Decision Support Module in MeTree.&#xD;
      The prototype will focus on breast cancer, as a demonstration case, since the prevalence is&#xD;
      high, the value of risk assessment is established, and MeTree already assesses risk for both&#xD;
      familial and hereditary forms. To achieve this aim the investigators will work with Dr.&#xD;
      Joanne Ngeow, head of the Cancer Genetics Service at NCCS, to understand current risk&#xD;
      assessment practices in the oncology clinics, identify gaps and inefficiencies in meeting&#xD;
      Singapore's risk assessment guidelines, and adapt MeTree to facilitate uptake of&#xD;
      guideline-based care. All aspects of risk assessment will be evaluated, from gathering the&#xD;
      right type of data to understanding the appropriate clinical actions that follow from each&#xD;
      risk assessment result. The goals will be to: 1) create a MeTree integration plan for both&#xD;
      patients and providers that will optimize its value, 2) incorporate additional data elements&#xD;
      and risk algorithms into MeTree as appropriate, 3) generate tailored clinical decision&#xD;
      support for the patient and their oncologist to facilitate appropriate ordering and&#xD;
      interpretation of genetic tests. Drs. Wu, Orlando, and Ngeow will work together on all three&#xD;
      steps, with Dr. Ngeow's expertise in genetics and oncology at SingHealth being critical for&#xD;
      ensuring the team develops a useful and facile tool that meets the needs of SingHealth&#xD;
      oncologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Deliverables These efforts will provide a breast cancer clinical decision support module that&#xD;
      is ready for implementation testing in a breast cancer clinical environment. It will be a&#xD;
      model upon which additional cancer CDS modules could be built, tested, and implemented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Validate and Pilot the Breast Cancer Clinical Decision Support Module in a&#xD;
      clinical setting within SingHealth. To assess the feasibility and potential clinical utility&#xD;
      of the Breast Cancer Clinical Decision Support Module, the investigators will perform a&#xD;
      mixed-methods hybrid type II implementation-effectiveness pilot in the NCCS cancer genetics&#xD;
      clinic and one additional surgical breast cancer clinic. The results of this 12-week pilot&#xD;
      will inform both its potential impact on clinical care and how further to optimize it for&#xD;
      broader clinical integration.&#xD;
