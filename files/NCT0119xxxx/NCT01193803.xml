      Osteoarticular infections are painful and disabling diseases that require antimicrobial&#xD;
      treatment adapted to the microorganisms implicated. Microbiological cultures are currently&#xD;
      regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria. However, the sensitivity&#xD;
      of these cultures is very variable and depends both on the context in which clinical samples&#xD;
      are taken, and on the pathogen involved. The rate of detection varies according to infection&#xD;
      type: from 50 to 70% for infectious spondylodiscitis, 65 to 95% for prosthetic joint&#xD;
      infections, 50% for gonococcal arthritis and 90% for non-gonococcal arthritis. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the diagnostic performances of microbiological cultures and molecular&#xD;
      methods in case of osteoarticular infections. The gold standard will be established by an&#xD;
      expert group of osteoarticular infection (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a&#xD;
      surgeon, an anatomy-pathologist and a rheumatologist), which established the final diagnosis&#xD;
      of infected or not infected patients.&#xD;

      Background: Osteoarticular infections are painful and disabling diseases that require&#xD;
      antimicrobial treatment adapted to the microorganisms implicated. Microbiological cultures&#xD;
      are currently regarded as the reference for identification of pathogenic bacteria and it&#xD;
      seems that the microbiological cultures are sufficient in most cases to establish the&#xD;
      diagnosis. However, the sensitivity of these cultures is very variable and depends both on&#xD;
      the context in which clinical samples are taken, and on the pathogen involved. In addition,&#xD;
      previous experimental data show that molecular methods could produce a diagnosis missing by&#xD;
      conventional cultures. Main objective: The aim of the study is to evaluate the diagnostic&#xD;
      performances of microbiological cultures and molecular method by considering for the&#xD;
      definition of cases an accumulation of clinical, radiological and biological arguments&#xD;
      usually used to establish the diagnosis of bone and joint infections. The discordance of the&#xD;
      two methods will be secondary classified by an expert group of osteoarticular infection&#xD;
      (composed by a bacteriologist, a radiologist, a surgeon, a anatomy-pathologist and a&#xD;
      rheumatologist).Tested hypothesis:Interest of molecular methods for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      osteoarticular infections.Secondary objective:Quantification of the delay of the results&#xD;
      obtained by the two methods Study design: · One centre specialized in osteoarticular&#xD;
      infections· Observational prospective study· Two methods of diagnosis: cultures and molecular&#xD;
      methods· An expert group Included patients and number of patients: Total of 284 patients&#xD;
      composed by 194 cases and 90 controlsIncluded patients (n=194) will all have a suspected&#xD;
      diagnosis of osteoarticular infections included discitis, septic arthritis and prosthetic&#xD;
      joint infection defined by inclusions criteria.Results of the included patients will be&#xD;
      compared to those obtained from the group of control patients (n=90).Protocol of duration:&#xD;
      Study duration is 6 months for each patientThe protocol duration is planned for 2&#xD;
      yearsProcedures:All samples will be treated with the same procedure - Samples (synovial&#xD;
      fluids, biopsies, ..) will be recovered either during surgery, by puncture aspiration at the&#xD;
      bedside, or by guided ultrasonography, all under sterile conditions (mask, sterile gloves,&#xD;
      cautious skin preparation and towelling) and transported to the Bacteriology department in&#xD;
      sterile tubes without additional substrate in less than 12 hours. - Bacteriological&#xD;
      procedures will be performed according to the guidelines applied for osteoarticular infection&#xD;
      · Liquid samples: erythrocyte and leukocyte counts, polymorphonuclear percentage · Solid&#xD;
      specimens: crushed using a mechanic apparatus · Gram and auramine staining· Cultures at 37°C&#xD;
      on Columbia sheep blood agar (aerobically and anaerobically for 5 days), chocolate agar&#xD;
      supplemented with IsoVitaleX (with 5% CO2 for 5 days), brain heart infusion broth&#xD;
      (anaerobically for 15 days with subcultures done after 10 days on the same agar media, even&#xD;
      if aspect was not cloudy).· Mycobacterial culture : Lowenstein-Jensen and COLETSOS media,&#xD;
      MGIT incubated for 3 months.- Molecular procedures· DNA manipulations pre- and post-PCR: in&#xD;
      separate rooms with separate pipetting devices to prevent contamination of samples with&#xD;
      foreign DNA. · Equipment used in pre-PCR steps: DNA-free and UV-irradiated. · DNA extraction&#xD;
      based on Boom's method: QIAGEN kit and EZ1 BioRobot · Broad-range 16S rRNA gene amplification&#xD;
      · Amplicons: sequenced in both directions on an ABIPRISM 3100 analyser (Applied Bio systems,&#xD;
      COURTABOEUF, France). · Cloning experiments for several sequences in one sample· Analysis of&#xD;
      sequence: GenBank using the BLASTN program through the website of the National Centre of&#xD;
      Biotechnology Information.· Internal control PCR: b-actin gene· Real time PCR: for the&#xD;
      detection of mycobacteria and gonococcal arthritis- Potential implications: We could have&#xD;
      chosen, like the majority of the studies published to date, to compare our molecular method&#xD;
      with another method of diagnosis (culture, histology). However, there is not currently gold&#xD;
      standard and the diagnosis of osteoarticular infections generally rests on an accumulation of&#xD;
      arguments. The rule of the expert group is to determine, with less possible error, if each&#xD;
      patient included will be &quot;infected&quot;. This methodology is close to daily clinical reality and&#xD;
      trusted in physician who was treating the patient. If the study shows an advantage of the&#xD;
      molecular biology versus classical methods in our groups it would then be justified to&#xD;
      discuss the diagnosis diagram of osteoarticular infections.&#xD;
