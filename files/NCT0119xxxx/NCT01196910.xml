  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the effect of left or right high-frequency DTMS on ADHD&#xD;
      symptoms, cognitive performance and decision-making ability of ADHD adults, and to compare&#xD;
      this to the effect of sham DTMS on ADHD adults&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention deficit disorder in adults may be due to hypoactivity of prefrontal areas of the&#xD;
      brain. Increasing the activity of these areas may help improve symptoms in many of these&#xD;
      patients. In addition there is evidence as to dysfunction in both hemispheres of the brain,&#xD;
      but it is difficult to determine the contribution of each hemisphere's pattern of activity to&#xD;
      behavioral impairment. The purpose of this study is to use high-frequency DTMS to stimulate&#xD;
      activity either on the left side of the prefrontal cortex (one arm), or on the right side (a&#xD;
      second arm), to see if such stimulation improves attention, comparing to sham DTMS simulation&#xD;
      (a third arm).&#xD;

    <description>DTMS treatment will be given for 3 weeks, 5 days a week. Before each DTMS treatment, neural network excitation practice will be done using AttenGo software (AttenGo, Herzlia, Israel).&#xD;
Each treatment day: Follow-up to evaluate clinical side effects of treatment. Two additional meetings with DTMS treatment and follow-up will be held to evaluate the efficacy of treatment and side effects. The first will be four weeks after the end of the daily treatment phase; the second eight weeks after the end of the daily treatment phase.</description>
