  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators conducted a recent pilot study and found a strong positive correlation&#xD;
      between the consumption of 100% chocolate and acne exacerbation. However, this study had&#xD;
      limitations including the lack of placebo and the small sample size. Although studies have&#xD;
      been conducted assessing chocolate's effect on acne, no study has been done evaluating this&#xD;
      effect using chocolate with 100% cocoa content in a double blind placebo controlled fashion.&#xD;
      This study will analyze the difference in the number and type of acneiform lesions per&#xD;
      subject at the different time points (Day 4 and Day 7) compared to baseline in order to&#xD;
      increase the validity of the investigators results. In addition, the investigators will use&#xD;
      unsweetened cocoa powder,12 rather than chocolate candy, which contains higher quantities of&#xD;
      additive ingredients such as sugar and milk to avoid interference with the results and the&#xD;
      possibility to establish or not an association between the unsweetened cocoa and an effect on&#xD;
      acne.&#xD;
