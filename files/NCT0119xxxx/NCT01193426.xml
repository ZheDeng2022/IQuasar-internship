    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP), an infection of ascitic fluid in the absence of&#xD;
      localized intra-abdominal infection, is one of the main potentially fatal complications of&#xD;
      cirrhosis. In the case of SBP, early diagnosis and rapid therapeutic care can improve patient&#xD;
      survival (Garcia-Tsao, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of SBP is based on the detection of a polymorphonuclear neutrophils count equal&#xD;
      to or greater than 250 /mm3 in the ascitic fluid (method of reference). However, obtaining an&#xD;
      ascitic cell count is sometimes difficult because it can not always be performed in emergency&#xD;
      especially outside the opening hours of the laboratory of Bacteriology. This raises the&#xD;
      necessity of developing quick and easy alternative approaches of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few groups have proposed the use of urinary reagent strip for rapid diagnosis of SBP.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the investigators clinical teams have shown that the sensitivity of this test&#xD;
      was low in a large national multicenter prospective study involving more than a thousand&#xD;
      patients (Nousbaum et al., 2007). The use of Multistix strips test is thus not recommended&#xD;
      for the routine application of diagnosis of SBP due to its lack of sensitivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although performed on small groups of patients, several studies have reported that IL-8 or&#xD;
      IL-6 might be used as markers of ascitic fluid infections. Based on these data and confirmed&#xD;
      by the investigators preliminary results the investigators propose to study on a broad&#xD;
      recruitment of patients estimated to about 500 inclusions (about 45 infected patients) the&#xD;
      interest of using IL-8 and IL-6 as predictive markers of SBP. The investigators propose to&#xD;
      use an ELISA method, standardized, rapid and automated, applicable in the context of&#xD;
      emergency (7 days a week and 24 hours a day) as previously described in the work conducted to&#xD;
      exclude the urinary tract infection (Oregioni et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the preliminary experiments conducted for this project, the investigators also found&#xD;
      systematic variation of another marker, leptin. This is a protein hormone involved in the&#xD;
      inflammatory and immune responses (Otero et al., 2005). It appears necessary to include the&#xD;
      study of this marker in the analysis of differential protein response between patients&#xD;
      suffering or not suffering from SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a diagnostic study, non-interventional, prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter trial conducted over 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The main objective is to establish the diagnostic performance (sensitivity, specificity,&#xD;
           positive predictive value and negative) of IL-8 and IL-6, assayed in the ascites fluid&#xD;
           by an automated ELISA in the early diagnosis of SBP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary objectives are to confirm the interest of the measurement of leptin in the&#xD;
           SBP and to establish the diagnostic performance of IL-8 and IL-6 or leptin according to&#xD;
           different clinical features in patients (score Child-Pugh classification and history of&#xD;
           SBP, ascitic fluid infection with positive bacterial culture).&#xD;
