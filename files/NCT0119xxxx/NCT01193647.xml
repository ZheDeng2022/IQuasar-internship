      This study will begin to evaluate the heritability of rotator cuff disease, and begin&#xD;
      creation of a powerful resource for future genetic studies of rotator cuff disease.&#xD;

      Aim 1. We will recruit and study all patients of the PI who undergo MRI for shoulder&#xD;
      complaints. The PI is a shoulder and elbow surgeon and treats a variety of shoulder and&#xD;
      non-shoulder pathology. All patients agreeing to participate will undergo a history, physical&#xD;
      examination of the shoulder, recording of demographics, family history, genealogy, and risk&#xD;
      factors. All participants will provide a blood or saliva sample. Serum and DNA will be stored&#xD;
      at the University of Utah for future analysis. Based upon the results of MRI, patients will&#xD;
      be categorized based on the presence or absence or rotator cuff tearing. We hope to extend to&#xD;
      hospital-wide ascertainment eventually. All patients will be asked if they have known cases&#xD;
      of shoulder disorders in their family members. Patients will have the option of sharing their&#xD;
      living family members name and contact information with the research team, so we can contact&#xD;
      them and invite them to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. From this DNA bio-repository, we will begin to describe the familial nature of rotator&#xD;
      cuff disease and the characteristics related to increased risk. We will also begin&#xD;
      ascertainment and sampling of high-risk individuals and pedigrees, perform association&#xD;
      studies to identify risk-associated variants, and screen candidate genes as funding is&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Utilizing the Utah Population Database (UPDB), we will also define high risk pedigrees&#xD;
      within the cohort of individuals with rotator cuff tears. We will also use the database to&#xD;
      identify high risk pedigrees by examining the information on family members of patients of&#xD;
      with tears to identify high risk pedigrees as well. The RGE has already approved the use of&#xD;
      the UPDB for these purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: Use UUHSC medical records linked to the UPDB to define the heritable nature of rotator&#xD;
      cuff injury and other tendonopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 5: Determine ABO frequencies for patients with rotator cuff tears and compare to&#xD;
      population normals utilizing the UPDB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 6: Use UUHSC medical records linked to the UPDB to define the heritable nature of rotator&#xD;
      cuff injury and compression neuropathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 7: Query the UUHSC EDW for rotator cuff repair codes and obtain the ABO blood typing for&#xD;
      these patients. We will also obtain operative room reports, names and MRN numbers for these&#xD;
      patients to ensure there aren't duplications between already enrolled patients and UUHSC EDW&#xD;
      findings.&#xD;

        The initial set of study participants for this study will be recruited through the clinical&#xD;
        practice of the PI. Patients will be categorized based upon MRI confirmation of a rotator&#xD;
        cuff tear. All patients being treated for shoulder pain with a positive MRI for a rotator&#xD;
        cuff tear which was performed as a normal part of a clinical exam will be included as&#xD;
        possible participants (tear group). All patients being treated for shoulder pain with a&#xD;
        negative MRI for rotator cuff tearing (MRI performed for normal part of clinical exam) will&#xD;
        undergo an MRI of the opposite shoulder to confirm the absence (or presence) of rotator&#xD;
        cuff pathology and be categorized based upon the findings (either tear or no tear group).&#xD;
