      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling&#xD;
      pathway inhibitor RO4929097 (RO4929097) and erlotinib hydrochloride when given together in&#xD;
      treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer that is stage IV or has come back.&#xD;
      RO4929097 and erlotinib hydrochloride may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define the maximum-tolerated dose (MTD) and toxicity of RO4929097 combined with&#xD;
      erlotinib (erlotinib hydrochloride) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      (NSCLC). (Dose escalation portion) II. To assess whether the probability of detectable tumor&#xD;
      shrinkage or response by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) criteria&#xD;
      correlates with pre-therapy immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse phase protein array (RPPA)&#xD;
      expression of Notch 1, 2, 3, and 4. (Dose escalation portion) III. A preliminary, exploratory&#xD;
      assessment will be performed with respect to percent tumor shrinkage and the probability of&#xD;
      response over the first 2 cycles of therapy. (Expansion cohort) IV. A preliminary,&#xD;
      exploratory assessment will be performed with respect to change in tumor immunohistochemistry&#xD;
      (IHC) scores and reverse phase protein array (RPPA) expression for Notch 1, 2, 3, and 4 over&#xD;
      the first 2 cycles of erlotinib. (Expansion cohort)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform a preliminary exploratory assessment of whether probability of detectable tumor&#xD;
      shrinkage/response correlates with pre RO4929097 presence in tumor of an activating epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation, the T790M EGFR mutation, met proto-oncogene (c-MET)&#xD;
      gene amplification or insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression or activation&#xD;
      or various Notch pathway markers. (Dose escalation portion) II. To perform a preliminary&#xD;
      exploratory assessment of whether addition of RO4929097 to erlotinib leads to tumor&#xD;
      shrinkage/response in any tumor deposits that had previously exhibited growth on erlotinib&#xD;
      alone. (Dose escalation portion) III. Conduct a preliminary exploratory assessment on the&#xD;
      expansion cohort with respect to tumor shrinkage/response of the following over the first 2&#xD;
      cycles of erlotinib and RO4929097 treatment with and without the presence of mutation,&#xD;
      amplification, and activation of markers: tumor IHC scores and RPPA expression of the Notch&#xD;
      ligand jagged 1 (Jag1), and the Notch targets hairy and enhancer of split 1 (HES1),&#xD;
      hairy/enhancer-of-split related with YRPW motif protein 1 (HEY1); tumor IHC scores and RPPA&#xD;
      expression of putative stem cell markers cluster of differentiation (CD)24 (decreased in stem&#xD;
      cells), CD44, CD133, dehydrogenase and of the epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT)&#xD;
      markers E-cadherin and vimentin; detectability in tumor of EGFR T790M mutations, MET&#xD;
      amplification, and IGF-1R expression and activation; and soluble markers of angiogenesis,&#xD;
      including stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF-1alpha), basic fibroblastic growth factor&#xD;
      (bFGF), cryptic epitope of collagen IV, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-8, vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF). (Expansion cohort) IV. Conduct a preliminary exploratory assessment of whether&#xD;
      percent tumor shrinkage/response or time to progression correlates with pre-therapy IHC and&#xD;
      RPPA expression of Notch 1, 2, 3 and 4, the above Notch pathway and stem cell markers, with&#xD;
      baseline detectability of T790M mutations and MET amplification, and with baseline IGF-1R&#xD;
      expression and activation, and with change in these markers from the initial biopsy to the&#xD;
      subsequent biopsy. (Expansion cohort) V. In tumor samples collected both during the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase and in the expansion cohort, assess if IHC and RPPA expression of Notch,&#xD;
      Notch ligand and Notch targets correlates with expression of stem cell markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Assess if percent tumor shrinkage/response, time to progression and baseline and change&#xD;
      in IHC and RPPA expression of Notch, Notch ligand, Notch targets and stem cell markers varies&#xD;
      with: tumor Notch gene amplification as assessed by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH);&#xD;
      tumor IHC and RPPA expression of selected members of the Wnt and Hedgehog pathways (since&#xD;
      these could lead to stem cell properties in cells that do not express Notch); host&#xD;
      (peripheral blood mononuclear cell) polymorphisms for relevant genes in the Notch pathway;&#xD;
      tumor micro ribonucleic acid (RNA) levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Trough levels of erlotinib and RO4929097 will be measured in plasma samples of all&#xD;
      patients on the dose-escalation portion of the study approximately 24 hours after the cycle&#xD;
      1, day 1 dose and again approximately 24 hours after the cycle 2, day 1 dose. These&#xD;
      measurements are being done to permit a preliminary exploratory assessment of whether there&#xD;
      is induction of metabolism of one or both drugs that will lead to decreased drug plasma&#xD;
      concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. In the Expansion Cohort, plasma levels of erlotinib and RO4929097 will be measured&#xD;
      approximately 24 hours after the cycle 2, day 21 erlotinib dose (just prior to initiation of&#xD;
      cycle 3), and plasma levels of both agents will be measured in plasma approximately 24 hours&#xD;
      after the cycle 3, day 1 doses of both agents. These measurements are done to permit a&#xD;
      preliminary exploratory assessment of whether: plasma drug levels correlate with % tumor&#xD;
      shrinkage/response or with change in tumor biomarkers over the first 6 weeks of therapy;&#xD;
      erlotinib plasma concentrations are affected by RO4929097 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive erlotinib hydrochloride orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21 and&#xD;
      gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO QD on days 1-3, 8-10, and&#xD;
      15-17. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 12 weeks.&#xD;

             molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitor [TKI] or antibody); (Note: this in contrast to the&#xD;
             dose escalation portion of the study in which patients with prior anti-EGFR therapy&#xD;
             will be eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to RO4929097, OSI-774 or other agents used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking medications with narrow therapeutic indices that are metabolized by&#xD;
             cytochrome P450 (CYP450), including warfarin sodium (Coumadin®) are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 concurrently with CYP3A4 substrates,&#xD;
             inducers, and/or inhibitors; furthermore, patients who are taking concurrent&#xD;
             medications (other than erlotinib) that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates&#xD;
             of CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications; if such patients cannot be&#xD;
             switched to alternative medications, they will be ineligible to participate in this&#xD;
             study; if a patient is taking a strong CYP3A4 inhibitor/inducer other than the 2 study&#xD;
             drugs, they should be switched to an alternative drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with&#xD;
             intestinal absorption&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diarrhea &gt; grade 1 despite appropriate therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are known to be serologically positive for hepatitis A, B or C are&#xD;
             ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with &gt; grade 1 (by Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events [CTCAE]&#xD;
             criteria) hyponatremia or hypocalcemia (based on measurement of ionized calcium)&#xD;
             despite appropriate medical management are excluded from this study, as are patients&#xD;
             with hypophosphatemia (serum phosphate below the lower limit of normal for the&#xD;
             institution), hypomagnesemia, (serum magnesium below the lower limit of normal),&#xD;
             hypokalemia, or hyperkalemia (serum potassium outside normal limits) despite&#xD;
             appropriate medical management&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection requiring systemic therapy (with antibiotics, antiviral or antifungal&#xD;
             agents), symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, angina at&#xD;
             rest, a history of torsades de pointes, potentially life-threatening cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmias (patients are permitted to have chronic, stable atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
             premature atrial or ventricular contractions, sinus tachycardia, provided the rate is&#xD;
             controlled at &lt; 115 per minute, and sinus bradycardia, provided the rate is &gt; 50 per&#xD;
             minute), myocardial infarction within the previous 3 months, or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular: baseline corrected QT interval using Fridericia's formula (QTcF) &gt; 450&#xD;
             msec (male) or QTcF &gt; 470 msec (female)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring drugs that are known to cause Torsades de pointes and/or prolonged&#xD;
             corrected QT (QTc) intervals are excluded; patients requiring drugs with a possible&#xD;
             but unproven association with Torsades de pointes and/or QTc prolongation may be&#xD;
             eligible, but will require additional electrocardiogram assessments, as outlined&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have not recovered to &lt; CTCAE grade 2 toxicities related to prior therapy&#xD;
             are not eligible to participate in this study&#xD;
