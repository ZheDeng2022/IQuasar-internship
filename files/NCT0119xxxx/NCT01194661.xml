      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Previous research has shown that certain parts of the brain are involved in voluntarily&#xD;
      stopping an ongoing motor response (movement); however, it is not known whether this same&#xD;
      network is also involved in suppressing an urge to act. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) can&#xD;
      significantly impair the brain's ability to voluntarily stop or inhibit certain actions.&#xD;
      Using brain imaging (functional magnetic resonance imaging, or fMRI) and brain stimulation&#xD;
      (transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS) to investigate how people perform activities that&#xD;
      involve moving and suppressing movements, researchers hope to better understand how these&#xD;
      brain areas might be affected in people who have had TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the parts of the brain involved in suppressing an urge to act.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the extent to which traumatic brain injury affecting certain parts of the&#xD;
           brain is involved in problems with suppressing an urge to move and stopping movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals 18 to 40 years of age who have had mild or moderate TBI, or are healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This research study includes a screening visit and two study visits, each of which will&#xD;
           last at least 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical examination and medical history. Women who&#xD;
           can become pregnant will have a urine pregnancy test before being allowed to participate&#xD;
           in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the first study visit, participants will complete one of the following experiment&#xD;
           tests in an MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experiment 1: Participants will be shown arrows or images on a computer screen, and will&#xD;
           press a button or not press a button depending on the image shown. Participants will&#xD;
           practice the experiment tasks before performing them during MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experiment 2: Participants will be shown arrows or images on a computer screen, and will&#xD;
           press a button or not press a button depending on the image shown. Participants will&#xD;
           also have TMS while at rest, and will perform the experiment tasks during the MRI scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the second study visit, participants will have an fMRI scan where they will be asked&#xD;
           to do simple response tasks with a computer outside the MRI scanner.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Voluntarily stopping an on-going motor response has been shown to engage a specific&#xD;
      prefrontal-basal-ganglia (PBG) neural network. However, it is not known whether the PBG&#xD;
      network is also crucial for other types of response inhibition such as suppressing an urge to&#xD;
      act (i.e., habitual impulse), a common impairment after traumatic brain injury (TBI). The&#xD;
      objectives of this protocol are: 1) to determine whether the PBG network is engaged in&#xD;
      suppressing habitual impulses and, 2) to determine the extent to which the (PBG) neural&#xD;
      network can account for the deficiency in response inhibition after mild to moderate&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury (TBI). The proposed studies will involve performance of simple&#xD;
      behavioral tasks, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS), transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), and diffusion tensor&#xD;
      imaging (DTI). tDCS will be applied separately from fMRI scans. TMS will be applied&#xD;
      separately or concurrently during fMRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and ninety healthy adult volunteers and 95 patients with mild to moderate TBI&#xD;
      will be recruited under the protocol. Eighty of the healthy volunteers and 80 of the patients&#xD;
      will be recruited under the project funded by the Center for Neuroscience and Rehabilitative&#xD;
      Medicine (CNRM) at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences (USUHS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are five experiments. Experiment 1 includes healthy adult volunteers and mild to&#xD;
      moderate TBI patients to determine whether the PBG inhibitory network is engaged in the&#xD;
      suppression of an undesirable habitual impulse. Subjects will perform simple motor response&#xD;
      tasks during fMRI scans. Experiment 2 will use fMRI with behavioral tasks and apply&#xD;
      single-pulse TMS during fMRI scans when subjects are at rest to examine whether changes in&#xD;
      the active and resting neural connectivity within the PBG network are associated with&#xD;
      deficiency in response inhibition after mild to moderate TBI. Experiment 3 will involve only&#xD;
      healthy volunteers to determine the effect of disruption of critical links/brain regions&#xD;
      within the PBG network on response inhibition. Inhibitory rTMS (i.e., 1Hz repetitive TMS with&#xD;
      stimulation intensity at 80% of a subject s own resting motor threshold [rMT]) will be&#xD;
      applied in separate groups of subjects immediately before the behavioral tasks. Experiments&#xD;
      4-5 will use similar response tasks as in Experiment 1 but with patients who have had blast&#xD;
      induced concussion(s). tDCS will be applied in Experiment 5 to examine the extent to which&#xD;
      tDCS may change connectivity and improve rapid response inhibition. Additional behavioral&#xD;
      measures, DTI, and high-resolution structural MRI images will be acquired in a separate&#xD;
      session for all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major outcome measures will include: 1) Task and TMS induced fMRI BOLD signal change and, 2)&#xD;
      Behavioral performance data (reaction time and accuracy). Secondary measures: White matter&#xD;
      fiber integrity and fiber tracking based on diffusion tensor imaging data.&#xD;
