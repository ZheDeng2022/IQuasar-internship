      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty consecutive patients fulfilling the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD will be&#xD;
      recruited from the inpatient and outpatient treatment programs at the Beer Sheva Mental&#xD;
      Health Center. Patients will complet a course of 10 daily rTMS sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving a full explanation of the procedures, all subjects will sign a written&#xD;
      informed consent statement approved by the Helsinki Ethics Committee of Ben-Gurion&#xD;
      University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study suggested here will recruit 40 patients with DSM-IV PTSD also demonstrating at&#xD;
      least moderately severe flashbacks. Each of the subjects will be recruited randomly to one of&#xD;
      4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Right DLPF Rtms (10Hz) co-administered with neutral visual and/or auditori stimuli;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Right DLPF Rtms (10Hz) co-administered with visual and/or auditori traumatic stimuli&#xD;
           mimicking experiences appearing during the patients flashbacks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Left DLPF Rtms (10Hz) co-administered with neutral visual and or auditori stimuli;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Left DLPF Rtms (10Hz) co-administered with visual and/or auditori traumatic stimuli&#xD;
           mimicking experiences appearing during the patients flashbacks;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS will be performed with a Magstim stimulator (Magstim Company, Whitland, U.K.) The motor&#xD;
      threshold was determined in each subject once, before treatment. This was defined as the&#xD;
      lowest stimulation intensity capable of inducing a visible movement at least five times out&#xD;
      of 10 stimulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The position of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be defined as 5 cm anterior (in&#xD;
      a parasagittal line) to the motor cortex. The stimulus intensity will be 80% of the patient's&#xD;
      motor threshold intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will be given for 20 minutes per day over 10 working days. Both subjects received&#xD;
      high-frequency rTMS) received 10 Hz for 2 seconds per train; the intertrain interval was 58&#xD;
      seconds. For each participant the stimulus was administered over the right dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratings of PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and depression willm be carried out by an expert&#xD;
      investigator who will be blind to the stimulation condition. The patients will be assessed at&#xD;
      four time points-before TMS (baseline), at day 5, at day 10, and at day 24 (14 days after the&#xD;
      intervention). The instruments used will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PTSD Checklist The Treatment Outcome PTSD Scale The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale The&#xD;
      Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression PTSD symptoms were assessed by using the Hebrew version&#xD;
      of the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale.&#xD;

      Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty consecutive patients fulfilling the DSM-IV diagnostic criteria for PTSD (as assessed by&#xD;
      the Structured Clinical Interview) will be recruited from the inpatient and outpatient&#xD;
      treatment programs at the Beer Sheva Mental Health Center. Patients will complet a course of&#xD;
      10 daily rTMS sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria includ: substance use disorder, cardiac pacemaker implant, or a&#xD;
      history of epilepsy, neurosurgery, or brain trauma. Patients suffering from chronic medical&#xD;
      conditions of any sort will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving a full explanation of the procedures, all subjects will sign a written&#xD;
      informed consent statement approved by the Helsinki Ethics Committee of Ben-Gurion&#xD;
      University.&#xD;

           mimicking experiences appearing during the patients flashbacks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Left DLPF Rtms (10Hz) co-administered with neutral visual and or auditori stimuli;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Left DLPF Rtms (10Hz) co-administered with visual and/or auditori traumatic stimuli&#xD;
           mimicking experiences appearing during the patients flashbacks;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
      rTMS will be performed with a Magstim stimulator (Magstim Company, Whitland, U.K.) having a&#xD;
      circular coil with a 9-cm diameter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The motor threshold will be determined in each subject once, before treatment. This will be&#xD;
      defined as the lowest stimulation intensity capable of inducing a visible movement at least&#xD;
      five times out of 10 stimulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The position of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex will be defined as 5 cm anterior (in&#xD;
      a parasagittal line) to the motor cortex. The stimulus intensity will be 80% of the patient's&#xD;
      motor threshold intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatments will be given for 20 minutes per day over 10 working days subjects will receive&#xD;
      high-frequency rTMS in a 10 Hz for 2 seconds per train; the intertrain interval will be 58&#xD;
      seconds. For each participant the stimulus will be administered over the right dorsolateral&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rating Scales&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ratings of PTSD symptoms, anxiety, and depression willm be carried out by an expert&#xD;
      investigator who will be blind to the stimulation condition. The patients will be assessed at&#xD;
      four time points-before TMS (baseline), at day 5, at day 10, and at day 24 (14 days after the&#xD;
      intervention). The instruments used will be as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PTSD Checklist is a 17-item self-report checklist of PTSD symptoms based closely on the&#xD;
      DSM-IV criteria. The respondents rate each item from 1 (&quot;not at all&quot;) to 5 (&quot;extremely&quot;) to&#xD;
      indicate the degree to which they have been bothered by that particular symptom over the past&#xD;
      month. Thus, the total scores can range from 17 to 85.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Treatment Outcome PTSD Scale is a clinician-rated instrument that measures the presence&#xD;
      and severity of PTSD. This eight-item instrument measures symptoms that occur frequently&#xD;
      within the PTSD population and is sensitive to the three major PTSD symptom dimensions&#xD;
      (intrusive thoughts, avoidance behavior, and hyperarousal symptoms). Each symptom is rated on&#xD;
      a defined step scale (0 to 4). Higher scores reflect greater severity on each measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale is a clinician-rated instrument that measures the presence&#xD;
      and severity of anxiety. This instrument covers 14 symptoms. Each symptom is rated on a&#xD;
      defined scale (0 to 4). Here, too, a higher numeric rating reflects greater symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression is a 23-item instrument that measures the presence&#xD;
      and severity of depression. Each symptom is rated on a defined scale (0 to 4), whereby a&#xD;
      higher numeric rating reflects greater symptom severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PTSD symptoms were assessed by using the Hebrew version of the Clinician-Administered PTSD&#xD;
      Scale. This is a structured interview for assessing PTSD according to DSM-IV criteria. It&#xD;
      quantifies symptom frequency and intensity for each of the criteria, yielding both a&#xD;
      continuous measure of symptom severity and a dichotomous classification of PTSD status. A&#xD;
      severity score for each symptom is calculated by summing the frequency and intensity scores.&#xD;
      Thus, the total range of the instrument is 0-136. If a particular symptom was not present,&#xD;
      the individual item was automatically scored as zero, as a default option. The Hebrew version&#xD;
      of the scale has been extensively used and validated&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be filled out in the presence of an interviewer, and the subjects&#xD;
      will be assisted in answering the questions if necessary. The interviewer will made sure that&#xD;
      all subjects clearly understood the content of each item and the different aspects of the&#xD;
      various component questions.&#xD;
