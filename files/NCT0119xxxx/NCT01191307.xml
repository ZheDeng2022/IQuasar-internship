      The ASK CHILDREN study is intended to aid in future development of various neurologic devices&#xD;
      (i.e. neuroprostheses). The ASK CHILDREN study seeks to use study information obtained to&#xD;
      identify more efficient strategies in the evaluation and review of neuroprostheses regulated&#xD;
      by the Agency. Specific aims of the clinical study include: (1) Collecting qualitative and&#xD;
      quantitative self-report clinical data (through interviews) from children undergoing&#xD;
      treatment related to human factors, safety, usability, and adverse events in patients ages 7&#xD;
      to 15 years old implanted with a neuroprosthesis targeting the brain or spinal cord (at two 6&#xD;
      month intervals); and (2) Establish a science-based framework of recommendations based upon&#xD;
      the data collected in the ASK CHILDREN Study to help develop more efficient strategies in&#xD;
      evaluating pediatric neuroprostheses regulated by the Agency.&#xD;
