  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to study the prognostic ability of various MRI imaging markers in the&#xD;
      evaluation of TBI patients. Cognitive, social, and occupational recovery will be measured at&#xD;
      each time point, and compared to MRI findings. Healthy volunteers will serve as a comparison&#xD;
      to the TBI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that novel MRI markers of metabolism, hemodynamics, functional&#xD;
      connectivity, and tissue microstructure will be related to the clinical status of the&#xD;
      patient, as well as their social and occupational outcomes.&#xD;

      The goal of this study is to identify advanced magnetic resonance imaging markers that can&#xD;
      serve as a prognostic marker in the evaluation and management of traumatic brain injury&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging and cognitive testing (when possible) will be performed in the&#xD;
      acute (within 10 days following injury), and recovery stages (about 1 month, about 6&#xD;
      months,and about 18 months). The relationship between the advanced magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      markers and the clinical condition of the patient will be evaluated at each time point to&#xD;
      determine which combination of imaging markers best describe the current clinical status of&#xD;
      the patient and which markers best predict a patient's outcome status.&#xD;
