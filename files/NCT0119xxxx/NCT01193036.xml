      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to develop a valid and reliable measure of the symptom burden&#xD;
      experienced by patients with cancer experiencing disease-related skin problems and to&#xD;
      delineate this burden over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Aim is to develop and validate an M.D. Anderson Symptom Inventory (MDASI) module&#xD;
      (the MDASI-Derm), compliant with FDA standards for patient-reported outcomes (PROs), to&#xD;
      measure the severity of multiple symptoms and the impact of these symptoms on daily&#xD;
      functioning in patients with cancer-related skin problems. We hypothesize that the MDASI-Derm&#xD;
      will be valid and reliable for measuring the severity of multiple symptoms and the impact of&#xD;
      these symptoms on daily functioning in patients with cancer-related skin problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary Aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to develop a detailed description of the severity and interference with daily activities&#xD;
           of symptoms experienced by patients with cancer-related skin problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the impact of symptom severity on standard function and quality of life (QOL)&#xD;
           measures including both quantitative (Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group [ECOG]&#xD;
           Performance Status, single-item QOL, and Skindex-16 scales) and qualitative measures&#xD;
           (patient interviews);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to evaluate the MDASI-Derm as an estimate of functional status and QOL in patients with&#xD;
           cancer-related skin problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. to identify common clusters of symptoms and symptom patterns occurring over multiple&#xD;
           measurement time points in patients with cancer-related skin problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. to define the qualitative symptom experience of patients with cancer-related skin&#xD;
           problems;&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. to explore the feasibility of the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system in measuring&#xD;
           symptom severity and interference with daily activities over time in patients with&#xD;
           cancer-related skin problems.&#xD;

      Part I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, while you are at the clinic for a visit, you will be&#xD;
      interviewed about skin problems and other symptoms that you have had since you began&#xD;
      experiencing skin problems. The interview should take about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the interview, you will be asked to answer a general symptom questionnaire, a&#xD;
      quality-of-life questionnaire, a skin-specific questionnaire, and some demographic questions&#xD;
      (such as your age and marital status). It should take about 15 minutes to complete all 4&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Symptom Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will complete a questionnaire about skin&#xD;
      problems and other symptoms you are having. This symptom questionnaire will ask you to rate&#xD;
      how severe your skin problems and other symptoms are and how the skin problems and other&#xD;
      symptoms affect the activities of your daily life. It should take about 5 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. You will complete the questionnaire at a routine clinic visit every 2 weeks for 1&#xD;
      year. If you do not have a clinic visit every 2 weeks, you will be called by an automated&#xD;
      phone system so you may complete the questionnaire at least 1 time every 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You can decide what time is most convenient for the automated phone system to call you. If&#xD;
      you are not available when the automated system calls, it will call you again at a later&#xD;
      time. You will be given a secure user name and identification number to use with the&#xD;
      automated phone system. The study staff will teach you how to use the automated phone system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two (2) days after you begin the study, you will fill out the symptom questionnaire again.&#xD;
      You will take home a paper copy of the questionnaire with you from the clinic with a&#xD;
      pre-addressed, stamped envelope given to you by the research staff so you can return it. The&#xD;
      research staff will also ask for your telephone number so that they may contact you and&#xD;
      remind you to complete the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality-of-Life/Demographic Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit, you will also be asked some demographic questions (such as your age and&#xD;
      employment status). Answering these questions should take about 1 minute. Some of these&#xD;
      questions (such as employment status) will be repeated at regular clinic visits. You will not&#xD;
      be asked to do this more often than every 3-5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit and at regular clinic visits, you will also rate your overall&#xD;
      quality-of-life. This should take about 1 minute to complete. You will not be asked to do&#xD;
      this more often than every 3-5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first visit and at regular clinic visits, you will be asked to complete a second&#xD;
      questionnaire that asks specific questions about how problems with your skin affect the&#xD;
      quality of your life. This should take about 5 minutes to complete. You will not be asked to&#xD;
      do this more often than every 3-5 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Opinion Questionnaire:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are 1 of the first 20 participants enrolled in Part 2 of this study, you will be asked&#xD;
      questions about your opinion of the symptom questionnaire after you have completed it for the&#xD;
      first time. For example, you will be asked if the symptom questionnaire was easy to&#xD;
      understand and complete, and if there were any other questions that should be included. The&#xD;
      study staff will use your opinion to decide if changes should be made to the questionnaire or&#xD;
      if important symptom questions are missing from the questionnaire. This questionnaire should&#xD;
      take about 5 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you have completed the interview and questionnaires, your participation on this study&#xD;
      will be over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study You will be on study for 1 year. You will be off study after you complete the&#xD;
      last symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 60 participants will take part in this study. Up to&#xD;
      20 will be enrolled in Part 1 of this study. Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in Part 2&#xD;
      of this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
