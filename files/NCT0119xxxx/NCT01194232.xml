  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cystic Fibrosis (CF), the most common inherited disease in Caucasians, is characterized by&#xD;
      chronic pulmonary inflammation and progressive loss of gas exchange units that eventually&#xD;
      results in respiratory failure. There is strong evidence that, in CF, abnormally low&#xD;
      perfusion carries a high risk of death independent from the presence of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension. However, the evolution of pulmonary vascular disease in CF and how it might&#xD;
      contribute to the rate of decline in lung function is not known. Our knowledge remains&#xD;
      limited to the results of old observational studies which concluded that the major causes of&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular remodeling and hypertension in CF are hypoxic respiratory failure and&#xD;
      destruction of lung tissue. Our recent data obtained by state-of-the-art Magnetic Resonance&#xD;
      Imaging (MRI) of the pulmonary circulation, challenges the existing paradigm. We demonstrate&#xD;
      that in the absence of hypoxia, significant changes in pulmonary perfusion and in surrogate&#xD;
      measures of vascular resistance as well as in collateral blood flow begin early in the course&#xD;
      of CF. Newly developed therapeutics have altered dramatically the course of patients&#xD;
      suffering from pulmonary vascular disease. Through this 8 week trial, we will examine by&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging the effect of Sildenafil on pulmonary perfusion and systemic&#xD;
      vascularization of the lungs in subjects with mild to moderate disease.&#xD;
