      Primary outcome measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the efficacy in terms of complete responses of induction therapy and first-line&#xD;
      consolidation of Clofarabine and low-dose Cytarabine with AML patients aged 60 years or more.&#xD;
      The first efficacy objective is evaluate the overall remission rate (TRG), where general&#xD;
      reference (RG) is defined as a patient who achieved complete remission (CR) or complete&#xD;
      remission with inadequate platelet recovery (CPR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate disease-free survival (DFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluate the overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of clofarabine and duration, severity and&#xD;
           relationship of adverse events (AEs) occurring during treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the rate of mortality at 30 days (ie, the incidence of deaths occurring&#xD;
           between Day 1 and Day 30 of induction cycle)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence, intensity (according to the latest version of the CTCAE classification),&#xD;
           duration, causality, severity and type of AA&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This protocol corresponds to a multicenter, phase II, open, non randomized, designed to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of clofarabine and low-dose cytarabine combination in AML patients&#xD;
      older than or equal to 60 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is divided into pre-treatment and treatment (cycle / s of induction and&#xD;
      consolidation) periods.The induction cycle consist of clofarabine at 20 mg/m2/day&#xD;
      intravenously for 5 consecutive days plus cytarabine subcutaneously at 20 mg/m2/day for 14&#xD;
      consecutive days. If patients do not achieve CR they will receive a second course of&#xD;
      induction with the same pattern. Consolidation cycles consist of clofarabine intravenously at&#xD;
      15 mg/m2/day for 5 consecutive days plus cytarabine at 20 mg/m2/day subcutaneously for 7&#xD;
      consecutive days. Patients will receive a maximum of 12 cycles of clofarabine and LDAC. The&#xD;
      monitoring phase of survival is made by clinical practice and will continue until all&#xD;
      patients have either died or survived two years after the end of treatment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 75 patients older than or equal to 60 years. Patients will be evaluated over&#xD;
      the following periods: Pre-treatment and treatment (induction and consolidation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment phase: includes enrolment visit in which the patient completes the written&#xD;
      informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a selection of patients who have given their written informed consent to join&#xD;
      the clinical trial. They must meet all the inclusion criteria and no exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase: Patients should begin treatment within 14 days after signing the informed&#xD;
      consent form (ICF). Selection period begins when the ICF is signed and the inclusion period&#xD;
      begins when the patient first receives the study drug (ie Day 1 of the induction cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated by monitoring all adverse events haematological and not&#xD;
      haematological related with the drug's study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final visit of treatment will take place at least 45 days after the last dose of study&#xD;
      drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who leave the study prematurely, should have the end of treatment visit within 2&#xD;
      weeks after the decision not to continue to administer the study drug. The final visit should&#xD;
      take place within 2 weeks after the visit of the last cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Off protocol, after making the final visit of, all patients receiving at least one dose of&#xD;
      study drug will be subject to monitoring by normal clinical practice, for a minimum of two&#xD;
      years from the final visit or until his death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum follow-up for all patients is 2 years from the final visit of the last patient&#xD;
      included and be conducted on a monthly basis during the first year and quarterly during the&#xD;
      second at least, notwithstanding that there may be more visits at discretion of each centre&#xD;
      or depending on the clinical features.&#xD;
