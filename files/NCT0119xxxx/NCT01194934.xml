  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the second clinical study of NOX-A12. This study intends to provide information on&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics (PD) of repeated&#xD;
      intravenous doses of NOX-A12 (2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg/d) alone and to compare the mobilization of&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) obtained with NOX-A12 alone with that obtained in combination&#xD;
      with filgrastim in healthy subjects. A single center, open-label, repeated dose study design&#xD;
      is selected to best address the study objectives.The results from this study will establish&#xD;
      the basis for further development of NOX-A12 in lymphoma patients undergoing autologous&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
