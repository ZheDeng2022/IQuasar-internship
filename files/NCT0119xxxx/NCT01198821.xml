      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Find out the largest dose of sodium bicarbonate that can be given with gemcitabine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine if the combination of sodium bicarbonate and gemcitabine produces better control of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer than gemcitabine alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gemcitabine will be administered as an intravenous drip over 30 minutes at a dose of 1000&#xD;
      mg/m2 on days 1, 8, and 15 of each cycle followed by a 7-day treatment rest period. No&#xD;
      treatment will be administered on the 4th week of the cycle. Each cycle is 28 days long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sodium bicarbonate is commercially available and supplied as tablets and water soluble&#xD;
      powder. It is stable in solid form and does not need refrigeration. The sodium bicarbonate&#xD;
      will be dispensed by the pharmacy in packets containing 1/3 the daily dose. The patient will&#xD;
      be asked to dissolve the powder in water 3 times per day and consume the dose over a period&#xD;
      of about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be required to refrain from use of additional buffering agents (antacids)&#xD;
      including sodium bicarbonate, CaCO3, and aluminum hydroxide.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have histologically confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma that is&#xD;
             metastatic or unresectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients previously untreated with chemotherapy in the metastatic setting. Prior 5-FU&#xD;
             or capecitabine treatment is allowed if: 1) it was given as part of a combined&#xD;
             modality chemoradiation regimen in the adjuvant setting and; 2) no greater than 30% of&#xD;
             bone marrow was included in the field and; 3) the treatment free interval has been ≥ 6&#xD;
             weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded) as ≥ 20 mm with&#xD;
             conventional techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤2 (Karnofsky ≥60%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes ≥ 3,000/μl&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/μl&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
