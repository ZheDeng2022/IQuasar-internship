      The purpose of the study aims is to help determine whether it is safe to change directly from&#xD;
      efavirenz to maraviroc in patients who are stable on an efavirenz-containing regimen. The&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics (drug levels) of efavirenz and maraviroc when efavirenz is stopped and&#xD;
      maraviroc is started will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the study patients and the study team will know which treatment is being taken at all&#xD;
      times in the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Maraviroc (MVC) is a CCR5 antagonist that prevents virus entry blocking the binding of&#xD;
      R5-tropic HIV to the cell surface CCR5 co-receptor. The MERIT Study compared MVC with EFV,&#xD;
      each with a Combivir backbone, as initial therapy. Using a non-inferiority margin of 10% MVC&#xD;
      was non-inferior to EFV using the &lt;400 copies/ml viral load cut-off but failed to reach&#xD;
      non-inferiority when a &lt;50 copies/ml analysis was used. Since this study was performed a more&#xD;
      sensitive tropism assay has become routinely available and a re-analysis of the MERIT results&#xD;
      showed that some of the patients with apparent R5-tropic virus actually had non-R5 virus.&#xD;
      When these patients were excluded from the analysis, MVC did achieve non-inferiority compared&#xD;
      to efavirenz. Of note, a subanalysis in the original MERIT Study of individuals with a&#xD;
      baseline viral load below 100,000 copies/ml demonstrated only a small numerical difference&#xD;
      between MVC and EFV recipients with 69.6% and 71.6% respectively achieving a viral load less&#xD;
      than 50 copies/ml at 48 weeks. Recent data from the MOTIVATE Study (a comparison of maraviroc&#xD;
      and placebo with optimised background regimen in treatment-experienced patients) showed&#xD;
      geno2pheno (a genotypic algorithm for tropism estimation) to be as accurate as Trofile (a&#xD;
      phenotypic assay) at predicting response to maraviroc. In situations where the genotypic and&#xD;
      phenotypic test showed discordant results virological response was similar to where both&#xD;
      demonstrated concordant R5-tropism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importantly MVC has been very well-tolerated in both treatment-na√Øve and&#xD;
      treatment-experienced patients. Overall similar proportions of subjects experienced grade 3/4&#xD;
      adverse events; importantly, malignancy rates were similar in the two arms (4.4% on EFV and&#xD;
      2.8% on MVC). Broadly, individual adverse events occurred at similar frequencies in the two&#xD;
      arms although abnormal dreams, dizziness and rash were all less common on MVC. In addition&#xD;
      median lipid changes were greater in the EFV arm, correlating with a lower predicted risk of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease for MVC recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maraviroc is a substrate of the CYP3A4 enzyme; therefore, its metabolism is reduced by pure&#xD;
      CYP3A4 inhibitors (most protease inhibitors) and increased by CYP3A4 inducers (such as EFV).&#xD;
      Dose adjustments are required when MVC is co-administered with certain protease inhibitors&#xD;
      (reduced from 300mg BD to 150mg BD) or EFV (increased from 300mg BD to 600mg BD). When&#xD;
      switching from a protease inhibitor (PI), the PI is cleared rapidly such that no interim dose&#xD;
      adjustment would be required. EFV, however, is cleared slowly and can remain at detectable&#xD;
      concentrations for several days and can continue to induce CYP3A4 for some time after&#xD;
      stopping the drug. Therefore, if switching from EFV to MVC, it can be expected that EFV may&#xD;
      affect MVC concentrations for a period of time after the switch. The length of time that the&#xD;
      inducing effect of EFV will persist for after stopping the drug is unclear. Crucially, the&#xD;
      inducing effect of EFV could result in sub-therapeutic MVC concentrations (if MVC is started&#xD;
      immediately after efavirenz) during initial therapy. Sub-therapeutic drug concentrations are&#xD;
      associated with virological failure and development of resistance. In addition, maintaining&#xD;
      an elevated dose of MVC after the induction effect of EFV has worn off could result in&#xD;
      adverse events (such as hypotension) hence the fact that, in this study, increased dose will&#xD;
      be maintained for a 2 week period only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, while MVC dose adjustments required during co-administration with EFV are&#xD;
      clear, the correct dose of MVC when switching from an EFV-containing regimen remains unknown.&#xD;
