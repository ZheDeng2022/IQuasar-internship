      This is an observational longitudinal study to determine the natural history and&#xD;
      genotype-phenotype correlations of disease causing mutations in Charcot Marie Tooth disease&#xD;
      (CMT) type 1B (CMT1B), 2A (CMT2A), 4A (CMT4A), and 4C (CMT4C).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will also be determine the capability of the newly developed CMT Pediatric&#xD;
      Scale (CMT Peds scale) and the Minimal Dataset to measure impairment and perform longitudinal&#xD;
      measurements in patients with multiple forms of CMT over a five year window&#xD;

      The Inherited Neuropathies Consortium (INC) is a member of the Rare Disease Clinical Research&#xD;
      Network (RDCRN) that is funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) through the Office&#xD;
      of Rare Diseases (ORD) and the NINDS. The University of Iowa is the lead center in INC which&#xD;
      also includes sites from the University of Pennsylvania, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia&#xD;
      (CHOP), the University of Rochester (NY), the National Hospital for Neurology and&#xD;
      Neurosurgery in London England, the Dubowicz Neuromuscular Center, and the University of&#xD;
      Miami (Florida). The North American CMT Network is an additional consortium that is funded by&#xD;
      the Muscular Dystrophy Association (MDA) and the Charcot Marie Tooth Association (CMTA). The&#xD;
      University of Iowa is the lead site for this consortium as well. Additional sites include the&#xD;
      University of Washington (Seattle), Vanderbilt University, Johns Hopkins University, the&#xD;
      University of Sydney, the Besta Neurological Institute in Milan (Italy), Harvard University&#xD;
      and the intramural Neurogenetics division of the NIH. All funding sources have agreed to&#xD;
      allow us to house data from the two consortia together at the NIH funded Data Management&#xD;
      Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South Florida and to group them under the&#xD;
      name of the Inherited Neuropathies Consortium (INC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inherited peripheral neuropathies are often called Charcot Marie Tooth Disease (CMT),&#xD;
      named after the three physician scientists who first described them. These are a heterogenous&#xD;
      group of disorders caused by mutations in more than 50 different genes. The diseases cause&#xD;
      weakness and loss of sensation in patients. There are no effective treatments for any forms&#xD;
      of CMT. There is also limited information on the natural history of how any of the different&#xD;
      types of CMT progress and limited outcome measures to measure impairment. The purpose of INC&#xD;
      is to investigate the natural history of the different types of CMT, to identify genes that&#xD;
      modify the severity of individual types of CMT, to develop and test outcome measures for&#xD;
      children with CMT, to develop an interactive website for patients with CMT and to develop the&#xD;
      knowledge needed to perform clinical trials in patients with CMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To do this, people who have, are suspected to have, or have a family history of an inherited&#xD;
      neuropathy will take part in a full-day evaluation. These patients are being seen in order to&#xD;
      receive a possible diagnosis of CMT and clinical care, but may also choose to participate in&#xD;
      this research project. Most of the testing being performed would be done as part of the&#xD;
      standard of care for diagnosing and treating a patient with an inherited neuropathy.&#xD;
      Additional testing may be performed on certain subjects if applicable, but the majority of&#xD;
      subjects who volunteer for this study are allowing us to use the clinical information&#xD;
      obtained during their visit as coded data for natural history purposes and to develop outcome&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because all individuals who attend the CMT clinic would be eligible for participation in this&#xD;
      study, when they arrive for their clinic visit, the initial meeting is to review the consent&#xD;
      form for the research project. Thus, the evaluation will begin with consenting subjects into&#xD;
      the study, if applicable. Then, a variety of tests will take place to measure the presence&#xD;
      and severity of symptoms, along with identifying which type of CMT a patient/subject may&#xD;
      have. Tests included in this study which are also the standard of care for patients with&#xD;
      inherited neuropathies include a neurological evaluation by a trained neurologist, a limited&#xD;
      set of nerve conduction studies, physical therapy assessment, orthotist assessment, genetic&#xD;
      counseling, and possibly genetic testing to determine the form of CMT. Additional clinical&#xD;
      testing which may be used for research includes EMGs or MUNE testing to evaluate possible&#xD;
      muscular dystrophies or muscle involvement in the disease. The results from these tests will&#xD;
      be used for diagnostic purposes and to give each patient a CMT Neuropathy Score (CMTNS) which&#xD;
      is a validated instrument that allows us to assess the severity of disease based on a 36&#xD;
      point scale. If the subject is also involved in the research project, the results will also&#xD;
      be used for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, some subjects may undergo testing which is not a part of regular clinical care,&#xD;
      but is being done for research purposes only. These tests/procedures may include hand&#xD;
      function testing, physical assessment using the CMT Peds Score (an instrument used to&#xD;
      evaluate children with CMT - see substudy 6603), research based genetic testing, quality of&#xD;
      life questionnaires, or a skin biopsy. All of these tests/procedures are optional, subjects&#xD;
      do not have to complete these to be involved in the overall natural history study. Opting out&#xD;
      of any of these procedures does not mean that they would be excluded from the study. Some of&#xD;
      these procedures would only be performed on certain individuals who are eligible based on age&#xD;
      or type of CMT. Skin biopsies are being performed on certain qualified subjects for research&#xD;
      purposes in order to grow fibroblast cells to further study various forms of CMT. These&#xD;
      individuals would be over 18 and have specific forms of CMT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there are sub-studies that are being performed which SOME subjects may be&#xD;
      eligible for. These sub-study options will be discussed with each patient prior to their&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study #6601 - Test-retest protocol addendum for pCMT-QOL. Substudy for a small group of&#xD;
      subjects in order to assess the test-retest reliability indicates reproducibility of the&#xD;
      pCMT-QOL. In order to calculate test-retest reliability, at a single site of the Inherited&#xD;
      Neuropathy Consortium (University of Iowa), 25 subjects aged 8-18 and their parents will be&#xD;
      given the appropriate version of pCMT-QOL, as well as the parents of 10 subjects aged 7 and&#xD;
      under. These parents will in addition be given a pre-stamped envelope containing the same&#xD;
      version of the pCMT-QOL that they took, to be completed by their child and/or parent in 4&#xD;
      weeks and return by mail (in CMT, the disease should not fluctuate in a 4 week interval).&#xD;
      Parents will be given one reminder phone call in 6-8 weeks, and the pCMT-QOL forms will be&#xD;
      mailed to them again if they are reported missing. Test-retest reliability will be estimated&#xD;
      by intraclass correlation coefficients (two-way random effects model) to show correlations&#xD;
      between any given individual's scores in two QOL assessments taken 4 weeks apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study #6602 - This project is to understand modifier genes and how they influence the&#xD;
      severity of disease expression, along with identifying new forms of CMT which have not been&#xD;
      genetically determined. Subjects who are eligible will either have CMT type 1A (CMT1A) or an&#xD;
      unknown form of CMT type 2 (CMT2). Blood will be drawn and sent to the University of Miami&#xD;
      where they receive the coded sample and process it through exome sequencing. Subjects will be&#xD;
      told that this is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sub-study #6603 - This project is to develop a new CMT Pediatric Scale (CMT Peds) for&#xD;
      Children with CMT. Although there is a validated score (the CMTNS) which measures disease&#xD;
      severity for CMT, it is not always applicable to children due to their limited ability to&#xD;
      relay information about their symptoms. The CMT Peds scale is being developed and validated&#xD;
      in order to measure disease severity in children and have outcome measures available for&#xD;
      future clinical trials. Children (defined as 21 and under) being evaluated will be asked to&#xD;
      perform functional tasks such as using stairs, walking in a hallway, and performing hand&#xD;
      function tests. This information will be used to validate the CMT Peds score. Subjects will&#xD;
      be informed that this study is optional.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These tests will be performed in one day during the clinic visit. Patients who attend the&#xD;
      clinic are given the option of returning for annual visits to help with disease management.&#xD;
      If a patient decides to follow up in the clinic, they will once again be asked to participate&#xD;
      in the research. They do not need to participate in the research in order to be seen in the&#xD;
      clinic, and they can opt out at any time. If a subject does not follow up by making an&#xD;
      appointment in the clinic, they will not be contacted by us to schedule a return visit. All&#xD;
      return visits are initiated by the patient/subject. An individual can decide not to&#xD;
      participate in the research, but will still be able to be seen in the clinic and receive&#xD;
      medical recommendations, treatment, and care by the clinical team who specializes in&#xD;
      inherited neuropathies.&#xD;

        All patients MUST be seen in person at a participating clinical site to be enrolled in the&#xD;
        study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria - Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 1B (CMT1B) and type 2A (CMT2A)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has documented, disease causing mutation in the MPZ gene (for CMT1B) or in&#xD;
             MFN2 (for CMT2A) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has a first or second degree family member (parent, child, sibling,&#xD;
             half-sibling, aunt, uncle, grandparent, or grandchild) with a documented disease&#xD;
             causing mutation AND a clear link between that family member and the affected patient&#xD;
             AND a phenotype consistent with the diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A clear link is necessary for a second-degree relative. For example, if a&#xD;
                  grandparent is affected and has a disease causing mutation, and the parent does&#xD;
                  not have any signs, symptoms, or electrophysiology consistent with the diagnosis,&#xD;
                  there is no clear link.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In cases where clear links are not available, genetic testing is required for the&#xD;
                  patient or the family member who is not clearly affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who have a variant of uncertain significance, as determined by the laboratory&#xD;
             performing the testing may still be included if one of the following circumstances&#xD;
             applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Variant is listed as disease causing at&#xD;
                  http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/CMTMutations/Mutations/Default.cfm.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Variant has been found in multiple affected people in a family and has not been&#xD;
                  found in unaffected family members. (Note - both affected and unaffected family&#xD;
                  members must be tested in this situation to be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has understood and signed an IRB approved consent form for the study.&#xD;
             Teenagers (age 13 - 17 years) must sign an assent form. See Appendix A for a sample&#xD;
             consent form with HIPAA. See Appendix B for a sample assent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria - Charcot Marie Tooth disease type 4A (CMT4A) and 4C (CMT4C)&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has two documented, disease causing mutations in the GDAP1 gene (for CMT4A) or&#xD;
             two mutations in the SH3TC2 gene (for CMT4C) OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have variants of uncertain significance, as determined by the laboratory&#xD;
             performing the testing, may still be included if one of the following circumstances&#xD;
             applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient has one known disease causing mutation and one variant that is listed as&#xD;
                  disease causing at http://www.molgen.ua.ac.be/CMTMutations/Mutations/Default.cfm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient has two variants listed as disease causing mutations at the above&#xD;
                  website.&#xD;
&#xD;
             OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patient is homozygous for a variant with or without consanguineous parents. OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The principal investigator and the site investigator agree that the variant(s) is&#xD;
                  (are) most likely disease causing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has understood and signed an IRB approved consent form for the study.&#xD;
             Teenagers (age 13 - 17 years) must sign an assent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ADDITIONAL PARTICIPANTS&#xD;
&#xD;
        For patients with other forms of CMT than listed above, we will perform all assessments to&#xD;
        prepare for further studies into the disease and the disease process. These patients will&#xD;
        be characterized based on their type of CMT, if known, or by the following categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nerve conduction velocities: demyelinating , axonal, intermediate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inheritance: dominant, recessive, X-linked, or unknown&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient does not have a documented mutation in MPZ (for CMT1B) or MFN2 (for CMT2A),&#xD;
             nor does a first or second degree family member. Patient does not have two documented&#xD;
             mutations in GDAP1 (for CMT4A) or SH3TC2 (CMT4C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has a variant of uncertain significance that cannot be further classified&#xD;
             following methods listed in the Inclusion Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient does not wish to be a part of the study or has not signed an informed consent&#xD;
             form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient is deemed inappropriate by the Site PI.&#xD;
