    <textblock>
      Each subject will be randomized and participate in two 10-day treatment periods during which&#xD;
      once daily dosing of mirabegron and mirabegron/moxifloxacin placebo or moxifloxacin and&#xD;
      moxifloxacin/mirabegron placebo will occur followed by a 1-day post-treatment period. Each&#xD;
      treatment period will be separated by a washout period of at least 12 days from the last dose&#xD;
      of study drug on Day 10 of Period 1 to Day -4 of Period 2.&#xD;
