    <textblock>
      Procedural pain in neonates is recently acknowledged entity and many studies on the use of&#xD;
      pharmacological as well as non pharmacological interventions for alleviation of this pain&#xD;
      have been done. Of these, sucrose with or without non nutritive sucking has been the most&#xD;
      widely studied and accepted form of pain relief. Its analgesic effect is thought to be&#xD;
      mediated by endogenous opioid pathways activated by sweet taste (orogustatory effect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, guidelines based on systematic reviews and meta-analysis for pain management&#xD;
      recommend the use of sucrose solutions for pain relief during procedures, the use of repeated&#xD;
      doses of sucrose with preterm neonates requires further investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain may have profound consequences for preterm neonates during a critical time of brain&#xD;
      development. Data derived from animal models suggests that repeated painful stimuli may&#xD;
      result in structural and functional reorganization of the nervous system and alteration in&#xD;
      future pain response. Early pain experience during this critical period in development are&#xD;
      thought to have immediate and long term consequences that could influence physiological,&#xD;
      behavioral and developmental outcomes. Early repetitive procedural pain related stress in&#xD;
      very preterm neonates is associated with poorer neurobehaviour in first 2 years of life.1&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the effect of repeated painful stimuli on short term neurobehaviour&#xD;
      of preterm infants and the efficacy of repeated doses of sucrose used for pain relief.&#xD;

      DEFINITION OF PAIN - an unpleasant sensory and emotional experience with actual or potential&#xD;
      damage or described in terms of such damage (note that the inability to communicate verbally&#xD;
      or non verbally does not negate the possibility that an individual is having pain and is in&#xD;
      need of appropriate pain relieving treatment)&#xD;
&#xD;
      HISTORICAL BACKGROUND- we as clinicians have emerged from a period of relative neglect of&#xD;
      neonatal pain and are now recognizing the immediate and long term impact of pain on the&#xD;
      neonatal development as well as the need to alleviate pain effectively. Neonatal pain has&#xD;
      been acknowledged and Paediatric societies such as American Academy of Paediatrics and&#xD;
      Canadian paediatric society (2000) have adopted specific guidelines on pain relief in&#xD;
      neonates .&#xD;
&#xD;
      LONG TERM EFFECTS OF CHRONIC PAIN -Early repeated procedural pain in NICU has been proposed&#xD;
      as one of the factors that may contribute to altered development of cognition ,motor function&#xD;
      and behaviour in infants and children born preterm.The vulnerability of preterms is well&#xD;
      established due to their lower pain threshold ,sensitization from repeated pain and immature&#xD;
      systems for maintaining homeostasis .For infants with extremely immature physiological and&#xD;
      neurobehavioural systems ,continual adaptation to repeated challenges induces long term&#xD;
      alterations in pain sensitivity, might affect generalized stress arousal systems and&#xD;
      potentially affect the developing cytotexture of the brain. The physiologic perturbations&#xD;
      associated with early prolonged exposure to episodic pain appear to contribute to altering&#xD;
      the rapidly developing stress systems .Exposure to painful procedures in early neonatal&#xD;
      period affects the long term neurobehavioural outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      .&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCALE USED TO ASSESS SHORT TERM NEUROBEHAVIOUR&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAPI (NEUROBEHAVIOURAL ASSESSMENT OF PRETERM INFANT) -The NAPI is appropriate for infants&#xD;
      between 32 weeks post conceptional age and term. It assesses the relative maturity of&#xD;
      functioning of preterm infants,with higher scores reflecting higher maturity , and can&#xD;
      differentiate 2 weeks PCA . The clinical validity and sensitivity of NAPI were established&#xD;
      using an index of medical complications based on a 1-5 classification range of degrees of&#xD;
      complications21 The items in the motor development cluster include ventral suspension, prone&#xD;
      head raising ,the crawling reflex ,forearm recoil ,power of active movements , and vigor of&#xD;
      spontaneous movements .The alertness and orientation items include percent of time in an&#xD;
      alert state ,duration and quality of alertness , quantitative response to inanimate and&#xD;
      animate visual and auditory stimulation and qualitative ratings that express the nature of&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LACUNAE IN KNOWLEDGE -Preterm infants are more prone to undergo multiple painful procedures&#xD;
      due to their prolonged stay in the neonatal intensive care unit and their typical vulnerable&#xD;
      clinical profile.It has now been proved that painful procedures lead to long term changes in&#xD;
      the pain reactivity and also affect the long term neurobehavioural outcome in these preterm&#xD;
      infants.When a medline search was carried out on the subject it did not return any&#xD;
      result.Currently there is no study which has tried to explore the short term neurobehavioural&#xD;
      outcome in preterm babies &gt;32 weeks - &lt;37 weeks of gestation who undergo multiple painful&#xD;
      procedures during their NICU stay.The present study was thus planned to evaluate the role of&#xD;
      sucrose analgesia in alleviating the pain caused by the routine NICU procedures over a period&#xD;
      of 7 days and to assess the early neurobehavioural outcome in these babies with the help of a&#xD;
      well designed double blinded randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
