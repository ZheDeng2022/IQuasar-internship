  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving gamma-secretase/Notch&#xD;
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 and temsirolimus together in treating patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. Gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 and&#xD;
      temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile of temsirolimus in&#xD;
      combination with RO4929097 (gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097) in&#xD;
      patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain pharmacokinetic (PK) profiles for both drugs when administered in combination in&#xD;
      order to quantify the expected interactive effects in PK between these two agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of both drugs when administered in combination,&#xD;
      with the goal of identifying potential predictive and PD markers that need further&#xD;
      exploration and validation in future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter, dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive temsirolimus IV over 30 minutes on day -6 (course 1 only). Patients then&#xD;
      receive temsirolimus IV or orally (PO) on days 1, 8, and 15 and gamma-secretase/Notch&#xD;
      signalling pathway inhibitor RO4929097 PO once daily on days 1-3, 8-10, and 15-17. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Blood&#xD;
      and tumor tissue samples may be collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and correlative&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 4 weeks.&#xD;
