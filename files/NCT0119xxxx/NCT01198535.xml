  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if a new drug, RO4929097, can work with cetuximab,&#xD;
      a drug already approved for colorectal cancer, to help fight the patient's cancer. Cancers&#xD;
      arise as a result of abnormal control of gene expression. One of the pathways that gets&#xD;
      abnormally regulated in some cancers is the Notch pathway. RO4929097 is an investigational&#xD;
      drug that blocks the activation of the Notch pathway. It is hoped that by blocking this&#xD;
      abnormal activation, this drug may be helpful in patients with cancer but the investigators&#xD;
      do not yet know if that is true. Cetuximab is an antibody against epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor and is known to have activity in metastatic colorectal cancer. Recent studies have&#xD;
      shown that people with colorectal cancers that contain a mutation in a gene called K-ras do&#xD;
      not benefit from receiving cetuximab. It is unknown if adding RO4929097 to cetuximab would&#xD;
      benefit patients who have tumors with this mutation.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determination of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the combination of cetuximab and&#xD;
      RO4929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Safety and tolerability of the combination of cetuximab and RO4929097. II. Exploratory&#xD;
      analyses of anti-tumor effect with the combination. III. Laboratory correlatives exploring&#xD;
      response rate with notch receptors and ligand expression, correlation of response and&#xD;
      toxicity profiles to expression of EGFR pathway components, and evaluation of serum and&#xD;
      tissue markers of gamma-secretase inhibitor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of gamma-secretase/Notch signalling pathway&#xD;
      inhibitor RO4929097.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I dose escalation: In this part of the study, the investigators are trying to find out&#xD;
      what is the highest tolerated dose of RO4929097 that can be safely combined with cetuximab.&#xD;
      The investigators will be testing two different cetuximab doses. One is the standard dose&#xD;
      (Arm A) and one is a little less than the standard dose (Arm B). Everyone will get treated&#xD;
      with cetuximab and R04929097 in this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I dose expansion: In this part of the study, the investigators will take the highest&#xD;
      tolerated dose found in the phase I part of the study and test a small number of people with&#xD;
      colorectal cancer to see if there is any activity with the combination of drugs. Everyone&#xD;
      will get treated with cetuximab and RO4929097 in this part of the study. This part of the&#xD;
      study will be restricted to patients whose tumors do not have a mutation in the K-ras gene.&#xD;
      RO4929097 is an investigational anti-cancer agent that has not yet been approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in colorectal cancer. Cetuximab is FDA approved for&#xD;
      metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The effects of RO4929097on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown; for this reason and because Notch signal pathway inhibitors as well&#xD;
             as other therapeutic agents used in this trial are known to be teratogenic, women of&#xD;
             childbearing potential and men must use two forms of contraception (i.e., barrier&#xD;
             contraception and one other method of contraception) at least 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             entry, for the duration of study participation, and for at least 12 months&#xD;
             post-treatment; should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or&#xD;
             her partner are participating in this study and for 12 months after study&#xD;
             participation, the patient should inform the treating physician immediately&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum pregnancy&#xD;
                  test (with a sensitivity of at least 25 mIU/mL) within 10-14 days and within 24&#xD;
                  hours prior to the first dose of RO4929097 (serum or urine); a pregnancy test&#xD;
                  (serum or urine) will be administered every 4 weeks if their menstrual cycles are&#xD;
                  regular or every 2 weeks if their cycles are irregular while on study within the&#xD;
                  24-hour period prior to the administration of RO4929097; a positive urine test&#xD;
                  must be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test; prior to dispensing RO4929097, the&#xD;
                  investigator must confirm and document the patient's use of two contraceptive&#xD;
                  methods, dates of negative pregnancy test, and confirm the patient's&#xD;
                  understanding of the teratogenic potential of RO4929097&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients of childbearing potential are defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients with regular menses&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patients, after menarche with amenorrhea, irregular cycles, or using a&#xD;
                       contraceptive method that precludes withdrawal bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Women who have had tubal ligation&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients may be considered to NOT be of childbearing potential for the&#xD;
                  following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The patient has undergone total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral&#xD;
                       salpingo-oophorectomy or bilateral oophorectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  The patient is medically confirmed to be menopausal (no menstrual period)&#xD;
                       for 24 consecutive months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow pills&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy or radiotherapy within 4 weeks (6 weeks for&#xD;
             nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to entering the study or those who have not&#xD;
             recovered to a grade 1 or less from adverse events due to agents administered more&#xD;
             than 4 weeks earlier with the exception of alopecia and neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not be receiving any other investigational agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to RO4929097 or other agents (EGFR antibodies) used in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients taking medications with narrow therapeutic indices that are metabolized by&#xD;
             cytochrome P450 (CYP450), including warfarin sodium (Coumadin®) are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Preclinical studies indicate that RO4929097 is a substrate of CYP3A4 and inducer of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 enzyme activity. Caution should be exercised when dosing RO4929097 concurrently&#xD;
             with CYP3A4 substrates, inducers, and/or inhibitors; furthermore, patients who are&#xD;
             taking concurrent medications that are strong inducers/inhibitors or substrates of&#xD;
             CYP3A4 should be switched to alternative medications to minimize any potential risk;&#xD;
             if such patients cannot be switched to alternative medications, they will be&#xD;
             ineligible to participate in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with malabsorption syndrome or other condition that would interfere with&#xD;
             intestinal absorption; patients must be able to swallow tablets&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled hypocalcemia, hypomagnesemia, hyponatremia,&#xD;
             hypophosphatemia or hypokalemia defined as less than the lower limit of normal for the&#xD;
             institution, despite adequate electrolyte supplementation are excluded from this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, a history&#xD;
             of torsades de pointes, significant cardiac arrhythmia other than chronic, stable&#xD;
             atrial fibrillation, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit&#xD;
             compliance with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because RO4929097 is a Notch pathway&#xD;
             inhibiting agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because&#xD;
             there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary&#xD;
             to treatment of the mother with RO4929097, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the&#xD;
             mother is treated with RO4929097; these potential risks may also apply to other agents&#xD;
             used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients on combination antiretroviral therapy are ineligible because of&#xD;
             the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with RO4929097; in addition, these&#xD;
             patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when treated with&#xD;
             marrow-suppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cardiovascular: baseline QTcF &gt; 450 msec (male) or QTcF &gt; 470 msec (female)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose tumor contains a mutation in KRAS are not eligible for the phase I dose&#xD;
             expansion portion of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior exposure to γ-secretase inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with another active malignancy&#xD;
