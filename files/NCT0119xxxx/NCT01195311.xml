  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, dose escalation study using a 3 + 3 design to determine if INCB024360&#xD;
      (study drug) is safe, well-tolerated and effective in patients with advanced malignancies.&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled and treated in cohorts of three and each observed a minimum of 28&#xD;
      days before the next group is enrolled and may begin to receive study drug. For subject&#xD;
      safety, the first subject in each cohort will be administered drug for one week before the&#xD;
      next two subjects in the cohort can begin drug administration. Doses will be escalated unless&#xD;
      a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) is observed in one of three subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expanded cohort of up to 15 patients may be recruited to further explore safety at the&#xD;
      'maximum tolerated dose' or at a lower, pharmacologically active, dose.&#xD;
