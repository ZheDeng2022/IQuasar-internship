      The purpose of this study is to test a standardized approach for children being evaluated for&#xD;
      appendicitis in the emergency department. This means that all doctors would use the same&#xD;
      approach to diagnose appendicitis in children in the emergency department. This pathway uses&#xD;
      two scoring systems to identify patients who are at high and low risks of appendicitis. These&#xD;
      scoring systems are based on the patient's symptoms, signs the doctor finds when examining&#xD;
      the patient, and their blood tests. The goal of this part of the study is to determine if the&#xD;
      investigators' pathway accurately identifies patients who have appendicitis.&#xD;

      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consent and enroll a prospective cohort as well as incorporate a&#xD;
      retrospective before and after chart review based on a HIPAA waiver of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective portion will study pediatric patients ages 3-18 being evaluated for acute&#xD;
      appendicitis in the OHSU/Doernbecher ED. Patients will be prospectively consented and&#xD;
      enrolled by the CRISP program. The treating physician will document specific clinical&#xD;
      predictors of acute appendicitis using a paper form. These criteria will be combined with&#xD;
      routine laboratory measurements to identify patients at high and low risk for acute&#xD;
      appendicitis based on two published and validated scoring systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      High risk patients will be directly admitted to the pediatric surgery service. Low risk&#xD;
      patients will be observed further in the ED or discharged home with close outpatient&#xD;
      follow-up based on the ED attending physician's judgment. Low risk patients will not be&#xD;
      routinely consulted by pediatric surgery unless by the discretion of the ED attending.&#xD;
      Patients at intermediate risk based on the scoring systems will continue evaluation in the ED&#xD;
      at the discretion of the attending physician. Patients who are not definitively diagnosed&#xD;
      with acute appendicitis by operative findings will be contacted by telephone at two weeks by&#xD;
      a trained research assistant to assess for missed outcomes, the same follow up method used by&#xD;
      Schneider et al. in another validation study of prediction rules for pediatric appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this clinical protocol is being introduced in the OHSU/Doernbecher ED independently of the&#xD;
      research study, patients not participating will likely also be treated according to a similar&#xD;
      algorithm. The only difference will be that non-participating patients will have no data&#xD;
      recorded except for that which is part of their regular clinical record, and will not be&#xD;
      contacted for follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes of interest for the prospective portion of the study include the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of the scoring systems for identifying acute appendicitis, as well as the&#xD;
      accuracy of various diagnostic elements including history, exam, laboratory studies, and&#xD;
      imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the effect of the protocol on hospital-level outcomes, a retrospective&#xD;
      before and after chart review study will also be conducted comparing the year before&#xD;
      implementation to the year after. These patients will be retrospectively enrolled based on a&#xD;
      HIPAA waiver of informed consent. Patients who consent to be included in the prospective&#xD;
      portion of the study will also be included in this retrospective analysis. Outcomes of&#xD;
      interest will include emergency department length of stay, time from arrival to inpatient bed&#xD;
      or surgery, time to specialty pediatric surgery consultation, use of diagnostic imaging, and&#xD;
      admission rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will prospectively enroll a consecutive sample of all patients aged 3 through 18&#xD;
      presenting to the OHSU ED for suspicion of appendicitis during the hours in which study staff&#xD;
      are available. The high risk (Alvarado) criteria have been validated in this age group.&#xD;
      Clinical Research Investigative Study Program (CRISP) volunteers who are on duty in the&#xD;
      emergency department between the hours of 7 am and 11 pm will identify possible patients&#xD;
      based on suggestive chief complaints (e.g abdominal pain, vomiting, etc) and approach the&#xD;
      attending physician about whether the patient is being evaluated for possible appendicitis.&#xD;
      If so, they will approach the family, consent them for participation, and prospectively&#xD;
      collect data on a paper form (see data collection section below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients transferred from another facility to the ED will be included, including those with&#xD;
      prior diagnostic imaging. Patients with symptoms greater than seven days will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the before and after portion of the study, patients will be enrolled retrospectively&#xD;
      based on screening of eligible charts in EPIC. Screening will be based on the chief&#xD;
      complaints and diagnoses in EPIC including abdominal pain, vomiting, appendicitis etc. Charts&#xD;
      identified by initial screening will be reviewed by a trained physician and included if they&#xD;
      judge that there was concern on the part of the attending physician for appendicitis. Their&#xD;
      information will be entered in an electronic database (see below). Patients will be entered&#xD;
      in the retrospective portion of the study regardless of whether they were enrolled in the&#xD;
      prospective section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Study Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a projected admission rate of 500 patients per year for suspected appendicitis, and&#xD;
      an admission rate of 50%, we expect 1000 eligible patients to be seen in the OHSU emergency&#xD;
      department annually. As the CRISP volunteers are present only 16 hours per day, with the&#xD;
      expectation that 75% of the patient volume presents during those hours, and based on a 50%&#xD;
      enrollment of eligible patients, we expect to prospectively enroll 375 patients in one year.&#xD;
      Based on a prevalence of appendicitis of 30% and specificity of the high risk criteria of&#xD;
      78.8% in a previous study evaluating the high risk criteria, our projected sample size will&#xD;
      yield of confidence interval for specificity of +/- 4.5%. For the low-risk criteria's&#xD;
      previously demonstrated sensitivity of 98%, our sample size should yield a confidence&#xD;
      interval for sensitivity of less than +/- 4%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The before and after portion of the study will enroll patients for a full year before and&#xD;
      after implementation to avoid the seasonal variation which is especially inherent in a&#xD;
      teaching hospital. Expected enrollment will therefore be 2000 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence rates in previous studies have ranged from 10 to 92% depending on inclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Those studies with the highest prevalence rate included only patients who received&#xD;
      who underwent surgery for suspected appendicitis. In studies with broad inclusion criteria&#xD;
      similar to ours, (e.g. ED evaluation for acute abdominal pain, surgical evaluation for&#xD;
      possible appendicitis), prevalence ranged from 10 to 61%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Special Patient Populations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be selected by the entry criteria described above. No special groups or&#xD;
      vulnerable populations are specifically chosen for inclusion, but may be included within the&#xD;
      general study population. There will be no specific exclusions on the basis of gender or&#xD;
      ethnic groups. Consent forms will be translated into Spanish by ViaLanguage. Spanish speaking&#xD;
      parents of limited English proficiency will be consented by professional in-person or&#xD;
      telephone translator. Other limited English proficiency parents will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prospective portion of the study, eligible parents will be consented for enrollment&#xD;
      by the CRISP volunteers using the attached consent forms. Children ages 7-18 will be asked to&#xD;
      assent using the attached form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the retrospective portion, patients will be enrolled based on a HIPAA waiver of informed&#xD;
      consent, with all data coming from the clinical record.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the prospective cohort portion of the study will be treated according to&#xD;
      the clinical pathway (see attached). This protocol was developed in collaboration between the&#xD;
      departments of emergency medicine and pediatric surgery. The pathway standardizes the routine&#xD;
      treatment of pediatric patients being evaluated for appendicitis (e.g. lab ordering, pain&#xD;
      medications, nursing assessments) as well as triages patients to further evaluation based on&#xD;
      validated low and high risk scoring systems including historical, physical exam, and&#xD;
      laboratory elements. Deviation from the pathway will be allowed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this pathway is being implemented as a departmental protocol (similar to many other&#xD;
      clinical pathways already in use in the emergency department) independent of the study,&#xD;
      non-enrolled patients will also be treated according to it at the discretion of the treating&#xD;
      physician. The only difference in treatment between enrolled and non-enrolled patients will&#xD;
      be that data will be recorded independently from the patient's clinical record for those&#xD;
      enrolled in the study, and enrolled patients will receive telephone follow-up two weeks after&#xD;
      discharge if needed to determine outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathway and form for tabulating low and high risk clinical and laboratory criteria will&#xD;
      be available for clinician reference for both enrolled and non-enrolled patients, but will&#xD;
      not be retained after the visit for those not participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective portion of the study will be based on EPIC chart review of patients being&#xD;
      evaluated for appendicitis in the twelve month periods before and after implementation of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the retrospective and prospective portions of the study will collect the following data:&#xD;
      Patient demographics including age and gender. Duration of symptoms. Visit characteristics&#xD;
      including referral from clinic, inter-hospital transfer, or presentation directly to the OHSU&#xD;
      ED. Studies performed within the 72 hours before and after emergency department arrival: CT&#xD;
      scan and abdominal/pelvic ultrasound, complete blood count, differential, urinalysis, urine&#xD;
      pregnancy tests, metabolic panel, liver function tests, lipase. Time variables: time of&#xD;
      emergency department room assignment, time of emergency department disposition, time of&#xD;
      incision for patients undergoing surgery. Disposition will be classified as home, ED&#xD;
      observation (defined by an ED stay &gt;8 hours), surgery (including admission to inpatient with&#xD;
      operation within 4 hours), inpatient observation (no operation within 4 hours of admission).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who were seen at another facility for this same condition within 72 hours of coming&#xD;
      to OHSU should have had the relevant part of that medical record sent with the patient, by&#xD;
      fax, or by electronic medical record (Kaiser HealthConnect or PACS imaging system). If those&#xD;
      records were not sent, the CRISP volunteer will obtain written permission on the HIPAA&#xD;
      release of information (see attached). This will be immediately faxed to the referring&#xD;
      facility so that this vital information is available to the treating physician for the&#xD;
      patient's care in the emergency department as well as for the study purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the prospective portion of the study, consented patients will also have the specific&#xD;
      signs and symptoms required for the calculation of the two scores documented on a form by the&#xD;
      ED attending physician (see attached). This form will also ask the physician to rate their&#xD;
      level of clinical suspicion for appendicitis prior to completing the scoring system. In the&#xD;
      prospective study, sensitivities and specificities of the high and low risk criteria will be&#xD;
      calculated for diagnosing appendicitis. Imaging study outcomes will be based on the&#xD;
      interpretation of the attending radiologist in the clinical chart. These interpretations will&#xD;
      then be classified as positive, negative, or indeterminate by a physician blinded to the&#xD;
      final diagnosis. Data will be analyzed both including and excluding patients with imaging&#xD;
      performed before transfer, as this may alter the use of the pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the prospective portion of the trial who do not have a surgically confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of appendicitis made during their hospitalization will be contacted by phone by a&#xD;
      research assistant (medical student or physician). The primary outcomes of interest will be&#xD;
      whether the patient was subsequently diagnosed with appendicitis. Other data will include all&#xD;
      subsequent medical visits and diagnostic studies, time until cessation of symptoms, and&#xD;
      alternative diagnoses made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time outcomes and rates of imaging and laboratory utilization will be compared in the periods&#xD;
      before and after implementation of the protocol in appropriate regression models&#xD;
      incorporating variables considered to be of importance a-priori including age, gender, and&#xD;
      pediatric ED census at the time of arrival by six hour block. Rates and location of pediatric&#xD;
      surgery consultation (ED versus inpatient) will also be recorded. Key outcomes will also be&#xD;
      analyzed in an interrupted-time-series fashion, looking at outcomes month by month in order&#xD;
      to track the immediate versus sustained effect of the protocol implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paper data collection forms will be transcribed to a Microsoft Access database kept on a&#xD;
      secured server at OHSU. Analysis will be conducted using STATA 11. Data analysis will be&#xD;
      performed at the Oregon Health Sciences University Department of Emergency Medicine. No data&#xD;
      will be shared outside of OHSU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the records have been entered in a Microsoft Access database kept on a secure server&#xD;
      with limited access at OHSU, records will be de-identified prior to analysis. The date of&#xD;
      visit will be changed to include only the month and date of birth will be converted to age in&#xD;
      order that they will not be identifiable. With these safeguards, we are confident that we can&#xD;
      adequately protect patient confidentiality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of participation in this study is that the clinical decision rules could result in&#xD;
      treatment that was inferior to that which would have occurred without this treatment pathway.&#xD;
      However, as the pathway is being implemented in the emergency department as a care standard,&#xD;
      patients would likely be treated according to it whether or not they participated in the&#xD;
      study. The other risk of participation is loss of privacy if confidential data were to be&#xD;
      compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As these risks are minimal, interim analysis or a data safety monitoring plan is unnecessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be monitored by the investigators and the department of emergency medicine&#xD;
      continuous quality assurance (CQI) process. The CQI process automatically flags all returns&#xD;
      to the emergency department within 48 hours of discharge and forwards them for review monthly&#xD;
      by the CQI committee. Cases of missed appendicitis, and other diagnoses require specific&#xD;
      treatment or hospitalization identified by two-week telephone follow up will be reviewed by&#xD;
      the CQI committee as well as the investigators and the division chief of pediatric emergency&#xD;
      medicine (Dr. Spiro). Cases of patient admitted to emergency department observation who were&#xD;
      subsequently admitted to the hospital will be identified by the research assistant and&#xD;
      reviewed by the investigators.&#xD;
