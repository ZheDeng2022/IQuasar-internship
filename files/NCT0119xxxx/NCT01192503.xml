  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if rasagiline improves RLS symptoms. We also want to&#xD;
      make sure rasagiline is safe to give people with RLS.&#xD;

      The primary objective is to determine if rasagiline, at a dosage of 1mg/day, is non-futile&#xD;
      for the treatment of RLS, as measured by the International RLS Study Group Rating Scale&#xD;
      (IRLS). The primary outcome variable will be the change in IRLS from baseline to Week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine if rasagiline, at a dosage of 1mg/day, is safe and&#xD;
      well-tolerated in participants with RLS. Also, to determine if rasagiline improves measures&#xD;
      of global clinical change, sleep quality, excessive sleepiness, quality of life, or&#xD;
      depressive symptoms.&#xD;
