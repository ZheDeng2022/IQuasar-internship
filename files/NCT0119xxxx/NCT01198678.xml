  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently marketed CGM sensors have an approved functional lifetime of up to 1 week.&#xD;
      Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that GluSense-LTone 2e3 sensors may be used to&#xD;
      accurately monitor glucose levels for 30 days. The purpose of this study is to assess the&#xD;
      safety and functionality of the device in human patients for consecutive 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GluSense-LTone 2e3 as long term CGM, will require less sensor replacements and calibration,&#xD;
      meaning less patient interventions, and is therefore will be much more user friendly.&#xD;
      Moreover, GluSense-LTone 2e3 shows potentially increased accuracy, especially in the&#xD;
      critically important hypoglycemic range, meaning that better management of patient's&#xD;
      condition may be attained.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      GluSense-LTone 2e3 is a continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) system. It is a semi-invasive,&#xD;
      optical fiber-based device with a lifetime of up to one month. The purpose of this study is&#xD;
      to assess the safety, accuracy, calibration requirements and effective lifetime of the&#xD;
      device.&#xD;
