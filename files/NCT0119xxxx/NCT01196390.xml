    <textblock>
      This randomized phase III trial studies how well radiation therapy, paclitaxel, and&#xD;
      carboplatin with or without trastuzumab work in treating patients with esophageal cancer.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as paclitaxel and carboplatin, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from&#xD;
      spreading. Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, may interfere with the ability of&#xD;
      tumor cells to grow and spread. It is not yet known whether giving radiation therapy and&#xD;
      combination chemotherapy together with or without trastuzumab is more effective in treating&#xD;
      esophageal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      l. To determine if trastuzumab increases disease-free survival when combined with trimodality&#xD;
      treatment (radiation plus chemotherapy followed by surgery) for patients with human epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-overexpressing esophageal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate if the addition of trastuzumab to trimodality treatment increases the&#xD;
      pathologic complete response rate and overall survival for patients with HER2-overexpressing&#xD;
      esophageal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To develop a tissue bank of tumor tissue from patients with non-metastatic esophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine molecular correlates of complete pathologic response, disease-free&#xD;
      survival, and overall survival for patients with HER2-overexpressing esophageal&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma treated with neoadjuvant and maintenance trastuzumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate predictors of cardiotoxicity in patients with esophageal cancer treated with&#xD;
      trastuzumab and chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate adverse events associated with the addition of trastuzumab to trimodality&#xD;
      treatment for patients with non-metastatic esophageal adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PATIENT-REPORTED QUALITY OF LIFE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if the addition of trastuzumab to trimodality treatment improves the&#xD;
      patient-reported Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy for Esophageal Cancer (FACT-E)&#xD;
      Esophageal Cancer Subscale (ECS) score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine if an improvement in the FACT-E ECS score at 6-8 weeks post completion of&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemoradiation correlates with pathologic complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine if pathologic complete response correlates with the FACT-E ECS score at 1&#xD;
      year and/or 2 years from the start of chemoradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if the addition of trastuzumab to trimodality treatment improves the Swallow&#xD;
      Index and Eating Index Subscale scores of the FACT-E.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine if the addition of trastuzumab to paclitaxel, carboplatin, and radiation&#xD;
      impacts quality-adjusted survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also&#xD;
      receive trastuzumab intravenously (IV) over 30-90 minutes on days 1, 8, 15, 22, 29, 36, and&#xD;
      57 and paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,&#xD;
      22, 29, and 36. Beginning 21-56 days after surgery, patients receive trastuzumab IV over&#xD;
      30-90 minutes. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 13 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients undergo radiotherapy once daily 5 days a week for 5.5 weeks. Patients also&#xD;
      receive paclitaxel IV over 60 minutes and carboplatin IV over 30-60 minutes on days 1, 8, 15,&#xD;
      22, 29, and 36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 5-8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy, all patients undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed up every 4 months for 2 years and&#xD;
      then yearly thereafter.&#xD;

    <description>A disease event is defined as local/regional persistence or recurrence of the cancer under study, distant metastases, a new second primary cancer, or death due to any cause. Participants undergoing surgery who had an R2 resection and participants not undergoing surgery who had a positive endoscopic biopsy or no biopsy at all were considered to have local persistence of disease. Disease-free survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of first disease event or last known follow-up (censored). Rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis was to occur after 162 events were reported.</description>

        <description>A disease event is defined as local/regional persistence or recurrence of the cancer under study, distant metastases, a new second primary cancer, or death due to any cause. Participants undergoing surgery who had an R2 resection and participants not undergoing surgery who had a positive endoscopic biopsy or no biopsy at all were considered to have local persistence of disease. Disease-free survival time is defined as time from randomization to the date of first disease event or last known follow-up (censored). Rates are estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Analysis was to occur after 162 events were reported.</description>

      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days.

    <limitations_and_caveats>Due to a considerable decrease in the overall rate of new disease-free survival events, the NRG Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) determined that the study would not reach the required 162 events in a reasonable amount of time. With power from the observed number of events calculated to be greater than 80%, the DMC recommended releasing the results for reporting.</limitations_and_caveats>
