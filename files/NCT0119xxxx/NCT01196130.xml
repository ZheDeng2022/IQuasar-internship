  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to test for biomarkers in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic or unresectable, locally advanced colorectal cancer. Biomarkers are chemical&#xD;
      &quot;markers&quot; in the tumor tissue and/or blood that may be related to your reaction to cancer&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. This study's biomarker testing is for research purposes&#xD;
      only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 1280 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The effectiveness of drugs used to treat colorectal cancer may be different from person to&#xD;
      person. Researchers want to learn if certain biomarkers can be used to help predict which&#xD;
      cancer drugs may work better than other drugs in different people with colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to take part in this study, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A leftover sample of tumor tissue from a previous procedure, if available, will be used&#xD;
           for biomarker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3 tablespoons) will be drawn for biomarker testing, to check for levels of&#xD;
           cytokines (proteins that may affect the immune system), and to check the circulating&#xD;
           tumor cells (CTCs) in your blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked how well you are able to perform the normal activities of daily living&#xD;
           (performance status).&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also fill out a questionnaire about the cancer symptoms. This should take about 5&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomarker Test Results:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor and staff will review the biomarker test results with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the results seem to show that a certain investigational drug may help to control the&#xD;
      cancer, and the drug is available through a separate MD Anderson clinical research study&#xD;
      called a &quot;companion&quot; drug study, your doctor may recommend that you have additional tests and&#xD;
      procedures performed. The tests and procedures will be performed as part of the companion&#xD;
      drug study to see if you are eligible to receive that drug. You will be asked to sign a&#xD;
      separate consent form for the companion drug study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that the biomarker test results may seem to show that more than one drug may&#xD;
      help to control the cancer. If so, it may be possible that you could receive the other&#xD;
      drug(s) under other companion studies in the future. The study tests described below would be&#xD;
      repeated during those other studies as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if the biomarker testing shows that a certain drug may be helpful, it is possible that&#xD;
      you may not be eligible to take part in the separate companion drug study, the study drug may&#xD;
      not be available, or there may be other reasons you cannot take part in the drug study. You&#xD;
      may also decide that you do not want to take part in the companion drug study. Your doctor&#xD;
      will discuss other available treatment options with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study visits for this biomarker research study, the following tests and procedures will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out the cancer symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker, cytokine, and CTC testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your schedule of study visits will depend on whether or not you take part in a companion&#xD;
      study. There is a different schedule of visits for participants who do not take part in a&#xD;
      companion study but instead either take part in a clinical research study that is not a&#xD;
      companion study or they receive standard cancer drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you take part in 1 or more companion studies, you will have study visits for this&#xD;
      biomarker research study on the following schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before you start taking the drug(s) if you join a companion drug study and it has been 2&#xD;
           or more weeks since you had these tests done (note: the amount of blood drawn will be&#xD;
           about 2 tablespoons at this visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each time you return for imaging scans during the time that you take part in 1 or more&#xD;
           companion drug studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after you stop taking part in a companion drug study&#xD;
&#xD;
      If your first treatment after consenting to this biomarker research study is part of a&#xD;
      clinical research study that is not a companion study or if you receive standard cancer&#xD;
      drug(s), you will have study visits for this biomarker research study on the following&#xD;
      schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  before you start taking the drug(s) during your first treatment period at MD Anderson&#xD;
           and it has been 2 or more weeks since you had these tests done (note: the amount of&#xD;
           blood drawn will be about 2 tablespoons at this visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  each time you return for imaging scans during your first treatment period at MD Anderson&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  after you first stop taking part in a clinical research study that is not a companion&#xD;
           drug study, or until you first stop taking standard cancer drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study testing will continue:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  for as long as you are taking part in a companion drug study, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  until you first stop taking part in a clinical research study that is not a companion&#xD;
           drug study, or until you first stop taking standard cancer drug(s), if you do not take&#xD;
           part in a companion drug study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you stop taking part in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out the cancer symptom questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for biomarker, cytokine, and CTC testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-Term Follow-Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After your follow-up visit, from then on, the research staff will collect information on your&#xD;
      health status, the drug(s) you receive, and the status of the disease. This information may&#xD;
      be collected at the time of standard clinic visits, by reviewing your medical record and&#xD;
      imaging scans, and/or by contacting you by phone, mail, and/or email. If you are called, the&#xD;
      call will last about 10 minutes or less.&#xD;
