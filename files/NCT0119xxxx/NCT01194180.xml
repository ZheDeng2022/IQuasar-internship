    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the BCG 'challenge' model a four-arm study design&#xD;
      has been chosen. Twelve subjects will be recruited into each arm of the study. Allocation of&#xD;
      BCG-naïve volunteers to either group A or B, and BCG-vaccinated volunteers to either group C&#xD;
      or D, will be performed on a one-to-one alternating basis. Subjects in each group will be&#xD;
      challenged by BCG administered intradermally. Prior to challenge, pre-existing immunity to TB&#xD;
      will be induced by vaccination with BCG, MVA85A, and both in combination (when compared to&#xD;
      BCG- &amp; MVA85A-naïve individuals). BCG quantification will be assessed by analysing the tissue&#xD;
      obtained in a punch biopsy of volunteers' skin over the site of BCG 'challenge' vaccination.&#xD;
      Any reduction in BCG quantification between groups will then be correlated to existing (and&#xD;
      future) laboratory assays of vaccine-induced immune responses in order to identify potential&#xD;
      immunological correlates of protection.&#xD;
