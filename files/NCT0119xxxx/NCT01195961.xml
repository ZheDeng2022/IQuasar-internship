      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Developmental dyscalculia is a learning disability in which individuals have difficulty&#xD;
      learning or comprehending mathematics or other number concepts (such as keeping score during&#xD;
      games, measuring time, or estimating distance). Developmental dyscalculia affects certain&#xD;
      parts of the brain that are required for processing numbers. Research has shown that a form&#xD;
      of brain stimulation called transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), applied when&#xD;
      healthy individuals are being trained to carry out tasks with numbers, improved the ability&#xD;
      to process numbers and solve math problems. More research is needed about whether tDCS can&#xD;
      improve number processing in people with developmental dyscalculia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To examine whether the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation can help&#xD;
      individuals with developmental dyscalculia perform mathematical calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have been diagnosed with developmental&#xD;
      dyscalculia, or are healthy volunteers without dyscalculia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have a screening visit and seven study visits. The screening visit and&#xD;
           six of the study visits will take place consecutively over the course of 6 days, and the&#xD;
           final visit will take place 3 months after the initial participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history, physical and neurological&#xD;
           examination, and a brief examination to test for dyscalculia and determine the&#xD;
           participant's dominant hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups for the study. One group&#xD;
           will receive tDCS during training to perform a task with numbers, and the other group&#xD;
           will receive the same training with sham stimulation. Participants will not know which&#xD;
           group they are in.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the study visits, participants will be trained on number tasks on 6 consecutive&#xD;
           days. Before the tDCS or sham stimulation is applied at the beginning of the experiment&#xD;
           and at the end of each training day, participants will perform other tasks with numbers.&#xD;
           Participants will be evaluated based on the accuracy and speed with which they respond&#xD;
           to the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the followup visit, participants will perform the same number tasks they completed&#xD;
           during the study visits. No tDCS will be performed at this visit.&#xD;

      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a condition in which subjects cannot process adequately&#xD;
      numerical concepts. Performance of arithmetical calculations is associated with fMRI activity&#xD;
      in an extended brain network that includes parietal and prefrontal cortices. Areas within the&#xD;
      parietal lobe, required for numerical processing in healthy subjects, are abnormal in&#xD;
      subjects with DD. The purpose of this single-blinded study is to determine if facilitatory&#xD;
      transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of these parietal areas in association with&#xD;
      numerical training will improve processing of numerical information relative to sham in&#xD;
      subjects with DD and in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 healthy volunteers and 30 subjects with developmental dyscalculia (DD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and subjects with DD will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. Each&#xD;
      group will receive anodal tDCS or sham with numerical training. All subjects will participate&#xD;
      in 7 sessions. First, they will be trained on an ordinal numerical task (numerical training&#xD;
      task) in which they will learn the magnitude relations between two numbers on 6 consecutive&#xD;
      days while receiving sham stimulation or tDCS during the training. Subjects will see two&#xD;
      numbers on the screen, one viewed on the left side of the screen and the other on the right&#xD;
      side of the screen (example, 2, 4), and they have to decide which one is larger. Performance&#xD;
      will be evaluated by fitting a power-law function. Before the beginning of the experiment and&#xD;
      after each training day subjects will perform a numerical Stroop task that assesses the&#xD;
      automaticity of numerical processing, and a number-space task that will provide information&#xD;
      on the subject's accuracy of mapping numbers into space. At the end of each of the 6 training&#xD;
      days (immediately post training) and 3 months (seventh session) later (retention measure)&#xD;
      subjects will be tested on a dyscalculia test (The Dyscalculia Screener),the numerical Stroop&#xD;
      task, and the number-space task&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be the improvement in automatic numerical processing&#xD;
      (numerical Stroop task) as reflected by reaction times. Secondary outcomes are accuracy when&#xD;
      mapping numbers into space (number-space task) and improvement in the dyscalculia score&#xD;
      (Dyscalculia Screener).&#xD;
