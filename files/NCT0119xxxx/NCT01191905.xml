  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute kidney injury (AKI) is a common and serious problem in critically ill patients, and is&#xD;
      known to be an independent risk factor for mortality. Among the various etiologies of AKI,&#xD;
      sepsis or septic shock is the most frequent contributing factor especially in an intensive&#xD;
      care unit setting. Also, the mortality of septic AKI in these patients still remains&#xD;
      extremely high despite recent marked therapeutic advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the physiologic superiority of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) on uremia&#xD;
      and volume control, it has become the modality of choice in critically ill patients with AKI.&#xD;
      In addition, CRRT can theoretically provide immunohomeostasis through the convective and&#xD;
      adsorptive removal of various immune mediators. Although the pathophysiology of septic AKI&#xD;
      remains elusive, it has become increasingly recognized that many pro- and anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      mediators, such as TNF, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10, play an important role in this process.&#xD;
      Therefore, it has been speculated that the reduction of cytokines by increasing CRRT dose in&#xD;
      patients with septic AKI may reduce mortality risk. Even though recent two large scale&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials, ATN and RENAL study, have failed to show the difference in&#xD;
      survival rate between the clearance of 20~25 ml/kg/hr and 35~40 ml/kg/hr, none of these&#xD;
      studies were designed to elucidate the survival benefit of high intensity CRRT in patients&#xD;
      with septic AKI. Moreover, the optimal target CRRT dose in these patients is not well&#xD;
      established and may be even higher than 35~40 ml/kg/hr in terms of septic AKI. Indeed, recent&#xD;
      several uncontrolled trial have shown the survival benefit of high intensity CRRT in these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further explore the effects of high dose CRRT on survival of critically ill patients with&#xD;
      septic AKI, the investigators will conduct a multicenter prospective randomized controlled&#xD;
      open-label trial which compares the difference in survival rate between 1:1 balanced&#xD;
      pre-dilution CVVHDF at 80 vs. 40 mL/Kg/hr for initial 72hrs after the start of CRRT. The&#xD;
      primary end-point of this study is the effect of high volume pre-dilution CVVHDF on 28-day&#xD;
      survival rate. The secondary end-point is 60- and 90-day mortality, ICU and in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality, duration of CRRT and renal replacement therapy, duration of mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation, cytokine removal rate at 12h after the initiation of CRRT, and changes in SOFA&#xD;
      and APACHE II score at 72h after the initiation of CRRT. This is a superiority trial which&#xD;
      aims to demonstrate a reduction of 20% or more in mortality rate. For this purpose, at least&#xD;
      109 subjects (a total of 218) would be required for each group if type I error rate is 5% and&#xD;
      type II error is 20% given 25% of drop-out rate during the study period. Block randomization&#xD;
      will be used by means of a dedicated website.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are still conflicting data on the optimal target dose of CRRT in patients with septic&#xD;
      AKI. Our study will address this issue to answer the unresolved question on the effect of&#xD;
      high dose CRRT.&#xD;
