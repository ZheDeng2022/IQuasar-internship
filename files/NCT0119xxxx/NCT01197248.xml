      Up to 50% of patients undergoing pelvic floor repair experience short-term postoperative&#xD;
      voiding dysfunction, increasing the length of hospitalization, cost and anxiety among&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism behind this problem is the sutures placed in the pubocervical fascia during the&#xD;
      cystocele repair. The cited benefit of bladder plication is greater cure of cystocele. The&#xD;
      existence of pubocervical fascia and the need for placement of plicating sutures over the&#xD;
      bladder have been questioned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine if avoiding cystocele plication in women&#xD;
      undergoing surgery for cystocele decreases the need of catheterization beyond post operative&#xD;
      day #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct a RCT of patients undergoing transvaginal repair of midline cystocele at the&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients will be randomized to receiving plicating sutures versus no&#xD;
      plication. This procedure may be conducted with or without concomitant correction of other&#xD;
      sites of prolapse. However, they will not have any procedures for correction of stress&#xD;
      incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be powered to detect a reduction in voiding dysfunction from 50% to 25% of&#xD;
      patients. Using a ฯ2 distribution, and an alpha error of 0.05, the required sample size is 58&#xD;
      patients per group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vaginal prolapse is a common problem in women. Approximately 11% of women undergo pelvic&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery for either pelvic organ prolapse and/or urinary incontinence[1].&#xD;
      Several surgical techniques for correction of prolapse have evolved and have been&#xD;
      scientifically evaluated. However, many basic surgical gynecological principles and&#xD;
      techniques have been passed on over generations without any scientific evaluation. The&#xD;
      technique of transvaginal repair of cystocele due to an anterior midline defect has&#xD;
      traditionally included four steps: 1. mobilization of the defect (i.e. separation of vagina&#xD;
      from bladder); 2. reduction of the defect (i.e. placement of plicating sutures into the&#xD;
      pubocervical fascia); 3. trimming of redundant vaginal tissues; and 4. reapproximating the&#xD;
      vaginal mucosa[2, 3]. Although each surgeon may modify any of these steps (ex. Depth of&#xD;
      dissection, location and number of sutures), the principles are consistent. The existence of&#xD;
      pubocervical fascia and the need for placement of plicating sutures over the bladder have&#xD;
      been questioned, and some vaginal surgeons omit this step[4-6]. The cited benefit of bladder&#xD;
      plication is greater cure of cystocele. Some of the potential risks of plication include&#xD;
      ureteric obstruction, if the sutures are near the ureteric orifice, and voiding dysfunction&#xD;
      if the sutures are near the urethrovesical junction[3, 7]. A chart review of patients at the&#xD;
      Mount Sinai Hospital, who underwent typical pelvic floor repair, including transvaginal&#xD;
      cystocele repair and mid-urethral sling, has shown that approximately 50% of patients&#xD;
      experience short-term postoperative voiding dysfunction (non-published data), increasing the&#xD;
      length of hospitalization, cost and anxiety among patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot trial will assess the short-term risks of cystocele plication, and will assess&#xD;
      trial feasibility. Ideally a larger subsequent trial will assess the cure of cystocele one&#xD;
      year after surgery. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to assess the&#xD;
      short-term post-operative outcomes in women who undergo this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3- Research Question In women with cystocele due to an anterior midline defect, does&#xD;
      cystocele plication (independent variable) result in more or less patients requiring&#xD;
      catheterization beyond postoperative day 2 (dependent variable) compared to no plication?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The hypothesis is that there may be more short-term voiding dysfunction and&#xD;
      ureteric obstruction following cystocele repair with plication than following cystocele&#xD;
      repair without plication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4- Population of Interest and Sampling Methods Inclusion criteria: Patients between 18 and 75&#xD;
      years, who will undergo surgery at the Mount Sinai Hospital that includes cystocele repair,&#xD;
      will be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Patients will be excluded if the surgeon places anterior vaginal mesh or&#xD;
      a mid-urethral sling, and/or if they had prior surgery for anterior vaginal wall prolapse&#xD;
      and/or stress urinary incontinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment strategy: The patients will be recruited at the Mount Sinai Hospital&#xD;
      Urogynecology Department. Approximately 4 to 6 eligible patients are seen per week and it is&#xD;
      estimated that at least one patient will be recruited per week. The study will be completed&#xD;
      in approximately two years. This will be a single centre study conducted at the Mount Sinai&#xD;
      Hospital, Toronto, Canada.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5- Manoeuvre Study Design This study is a double blind, randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      patients undergoing transvaginal repair of midline cystocele, with or without concomitant&#xD;
      correction of prolapse in other vaginal compartments, but without correction of stress&#xD;
      incontinence. All the patients will provide written informed consent for participation. At&#xD;
      baseline, all participants will undergo a standardized evaluation, which will include an&#xD;
      urogynecologic history, pelvic organ prolapse quantification examination, and urodynamic&#xD;
      evaluation. The urodynamic evaluation will include measurement of post-void residual urine&#xD;
      volume by catheter and/or ultrasound bladder scan, uroflowmetry, a filling cystometrogram and&#xD;
      urethral pressure profilometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized intraoperatively using computer-based randomization. At the time&#xD;
      of the surgical step of bladder plication, the computer program will be used, and will&#xD;
      indicate whether sutures will be placed or omitted. Trimming of redundant vaginal mucosa will&#xD;
      be performed before randomization to avoid any bias resulting from the amount of mucosa&#xD;
      removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized surgical technique&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Midline vaginal mucosal incision&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sharp surgical dissection between vagina and pubocervical fascia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completion of prolapse repair of vault, rectocele, uterine prolapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Manual reduction of prolapse and trimming of redundant vaginal mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open envelope to determine group of allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If randomization to plication, place midline interrupted sutures of 0 or 2-0&#xD;
           polyglycolic acid sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administer indigo carmine 5 ml IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cystoscopy with 70ยบ telescopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Close vaginal mucosa with running interlocking 0 or 2-0 polyglycolic sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol On postoperative day 1, patients will have the Foley catheter removed and&#xD;
      measurement of post-void residual urine volume will be done (either by in and out&#xD;
      catheterization, suprapubic ultrasound or via a Bonnano suprapubic catheter). Catheterization&#xD;
      will be continued until residual volumes are less than 200 ml twice in a row. Registered&#xD;
      nurses who will be masked to the treatment assignment will perform the post-operative&#xD;
      assessment and examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6- Outcomes Primary Outcome Measures The primary outcome variable will be the requirement for&#xD;
      catheterization beyond postoperative day 2. This has been chosen as the primary outcome since&#xD;
      this would delay the usual hospital discharge on postoperative day 2, thus presenting a&#xD;
      practical problem for patients (important based in our patients value and expectative after&#xD;
      pelvic organ prolapse surgery), physicians, and hospitals (cost).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Outcome Measures A secondary outcome will be intraoperative ureteric obstruction. All&#xD;
      patients, regardless of study arm, will undergo intraoperative cystoscopy following&#xD;
      intravenous administration of indigo carmine in order to identify this complication. If this&#xD;
      complication does occur the suspected plicating suture(s) will removed, replaced more&#xD;
      centrally, and cystoscopy repeated to ensure ureteric permeability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Sample Size A chart review of patients at the Mount Sinai Hospital, who underwent&#xD;
      typical pelvic floor repair, including transvaginal cystocele repair and mid-urethral sling,&#xD;
      has shown that approximately 50% of patients experience short-term postoperative voiding&#xD;
      dysfunction. In order to provide convincing evidence that there may be a benefit to omitting&#xD;
      plicating sutures, this study will be powered to detect a substantial difference in voiding&#xD;
      dysfunction - from 50% of patients down to 25% of patients. Using a chi-square distribution&#xD;
      and an alpha error of 0.05, the required sample size is 58 patients per group. (SAS 9.2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Statistical analysis will be performed using SAS 9.2 for Windowsโข.&#xD;
      Chi-square analysis will be used to evaluate categorical variables and T-Tests for continuous&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Management The data will be collected into a database. Statistical analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted using SAS 9.2. All data will be kept confidential and protected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Issues Written consent will be obtained from each participant. All data will be&#xD;
      anonymous and will only be coded by a participant identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ethics proposal will be submitted to the Mount Sinai Hospital Research Ethics Board prior&#xD;
      to beginning the recruitment. Patients with questions or concerns are free to contact the&#xD;
      research assistant or a representative from the ethics board for clarification. The contact&#xD;
      information will be noted in the consent form.&#xD;
