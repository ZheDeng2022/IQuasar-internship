  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial located in Hala district, Pakistan to determine&#xD;
      the impact of using Lady Health Workers (LHW) of National Program for Family Planning and&#xD;
      Primary Health Care to diagnose and manage severe pneumonia with oral amoxicillin on&#xD;
      treatment failure rates at day 6 among 2-59 month old children. LHWs in the control arm&#xD;
      receive a refresher in standard pneumonia case management. LHWs in the intervention arm&#xD;
      receive standard training that is enhanced to include training in the recognition of severe&#xD;
      pneumonia and its home management with oral amoxicillin. Clusters are by Union Council (UC),&#xD;
      administrator units consisting of 7 to 25 LHWs; each UC is randomized to either enhanced&#xD;
      pneumonia case management with oral amoxicillin therapy (intervention) for severe pneumonia&#xD;
      or standard case management and referral to the nearest health facility for treatment&#xD;
      (control). Process indicators reflecting the LHW's ability to assess, classify and treat&#xD;
      pneumonia in the intervention group and cost-effectiveness data is also being collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enhanced pneumonia case management and oral amoxicillin therapy for severe pneumonia&#xD;
      delivered by LHWs in the community will result in a reduction in treatment failure among&#xD;
      children 2 - 59 months of age with severe pneumonia who are treated by the LHW compared with&#xD;
      those referred for care by the LHW.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The proportion of treatment failure, [persistence of lower chest indrawing (LCI) or need&#xD;
           for second line treatment between day 3 and day 14], will be less in the intervention&#xD;
           arm compared with the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. LHWs can adequately assess, classify, and treat severe pneumonia in 2 - 59 month old&#xD;
           children, and adequately recognize and refer children who present with danger signs&#xD;
           during initial antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      children less than five years of age, and is responsible for over 2 million annual deaths in&#xD;
      this age group. Of the 10.8 million global child deaths estimated in 2000, 34% were in South&#xD;
      Asia and 21% of the total deaths were attributed to pneumonia. Inclusion of all deaths for&#xD;
      which acute lower respiratory infections (ALRI) are an associated cause would increase these&#xD;
      estimates by two to threefold. The ARI mortality burden is principally constituted by&#xD;
      pneumonia. The median incidence of pneumonia in under-five children in developing countries&#xD;
      is estimated to be 0.29 episodes (interquartile range 0.21-0.71) per child year. It is&#xD;
      estimated that in the developing countries 150.7 million new pneumonia cases occur each year,&#xD;
      of which 11-20 million (7-13%) are severe enough to require hospital admission. The region of&#xD;
      the world with the highest incidence of pneumonia is South and South East Asia with an&#xD;
      estimated 55.2 million episodes occurring in children under five years old. In the developed&#xD;
      world, an estimated 14.7 million cases occur each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent trends indicate that Pakistan has begun to lag behind many regional countries in major&#xD;
      indicators such as infant mortality rates (IMR). Currently, Pakistan has an IMR of 81/1000&#xD;
      live births and under-five mortality rate of 103/1000 live births. Annual number of child&#xD;
      deaths in Pakistan is estimated at 565,000, giving Pakistan 4th ranking after India, Nigeria&#xD;
      and China. Of more than 560,000 under-five deaths reported in Pakistan in 2001, 19% were due&#xD;
      to pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the community level WHO guidelines recommend that trained health workers treat non-severe&#xD;
      pneumonia with an oral antibiotic and refer children with severe pneumonia (i.e. lower chest&#xD;
      wall indrawing [LCI] present) to a local health facility to be treated by injectable&#xD;
      antibiotic (and oxygen, as required). A series of WHO sponsored randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      and a subsequent meta-analysis of results demonstrated that these guidelines implemented by&#xD;
      community-based health workers (CHWs) resulted in a 24-27% reduction in total child mortality&#xD;
      and a 36-42% reduction in pneumonia mortality in these research settings.Pandey et al. have&#xD;
      shown 28% reduction in total under-five mortality using locally trained community health&#xD;
      workers to detect and treat pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been previously shown that oral amoxicillin is an effective treatment for&#xD;
      (WHO-defined) severe pneumonia in children. More recently a multi-centre randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT) conducted in eight countries has shown that oral amoxicillin is as&#xD;
      effective as injectable penicillin for the treatment of severe pneumonia in a hospital&#xD;
      setting. For non-severe pneumonia two large multicentre RCTs in Pakistan and India have shown&#xD;
      that three-days' treatment with oral amoxicillin therapy was equivalent to five-days'&#xD;
      treatment. Non-adherence was the most important risk factor for treatment failure in these&#xD;
      studies and was also significantly related to longer duration of therapy. In addition, it has&#xD;
      been shown in studies from India and Bangladesh/Indonesia that the three-days' antibiotic&#xD;
      therapy resulted in lower prevalence of resistant organisms 15 days after initiation of&#xD;
      therapy, when compared with a five-days' therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The non-severe pneumonia and severe pneumonia studies mentioned above were all hospital based&#xD;
      clinical efficacy studies (several conducted by members of this project team) so that close&#xD;
      monitoring and follow-up could be assured. There is now a need to demonstrate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of these management strategies for severe pneumonia in the community when&#xD;
      implemented by CHWs. If the findings of the hospital-based RCTs can be replicated in&#xD;
      community settings then this may have a very significant impact on global policy in&#xD;
      community-based management of ARI in young children. Children with very severe pneumonia or&#xD;
      very severe disease (such as those who have danger signs) will continue to be referred for&#xD;
      hospital treatment following current WHO IMCI guidelines. The use of oral antibiotic for&#xD;
      treating severe pneumonia at the community level has many potential benefits. This case&#xD;
      management strategy, if shown to be effective, could:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  simplify treatment of severe pneumonia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  minimize the need for referral or hospitalization;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  decrease treatment administration costs;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce transport, food and lost income costs for the family;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce the pressure on already overburdened hospitals;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce the risk of needle-associated complications such as needle-borne infections; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduce the risk of nosocomial infection during hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LHWs in Pakistan are very well placed in the community and, in Hala district comprise the&#xD;
      mainstay of the primary health care system. LHWs are trained in standard ARI case management&#xD;
      based on WHO's guidelines and the program has an active health education component.&#xD;
      Management of pneumonia through standard case management, part of IMCI - an approach&#xD;
      developed by the WHO and UNICEF - is the principal strategy for reducing ARI mortality.LHWs&#xD;
      employing the IMCI approach classify the severity of respiratory infections by observing a&#xD;
      child for the key signs of pneumonia: chest in-drawing and fast breathing. With the help of&#xD;
      the refresher course recently developed by the LHW program - based on the IMCI algorithm -&#xD;
      LHWs will be additionally trained in identifying and managing severe pneumonia at the&#xD;
      community level and improve their skills in promotion of care-seeking for ANA.While it is&#xD;
      hoped that these measure will markedly reduce overall childhood mortality and pneumonia&#xD;
      related mortality in the community, the study being proposed here will measure the effect of&#xD;
      enhanced case management of ANA by LHWs in reducing the clinical treatment failure rate among&#xD;
      children 2-59 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEFINITION OF TREATMENT FAILURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected treatment failure will be determined by the LHW on subsequent home visits after the&#xD;
      child has been enrolled. The LHW will immediately contact the Lady Health Worker Supervisor&#xD;
      (LHS) who will independently confirm each case of failure. The provision of clinical care&#xD;
      (i.e. arranging referral) will not be delayed should there be a delay between the&#xD;
      identification of suspected treatment failure and confirmation by the LHS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Treatment Failure through day 5 for children 2-59 months will be defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical deterioration through day 5 or death occurring within 14 days of enrollment,&#xD;
           prior to change in primary antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Persistence of fever (&gt;or=100 F) and lower chest indrawing on day 3 (after 48 hours of&#xD;
           initiation of therapy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fever(&gt;or=100 F)or lower chest indrawing or appearance of any danger sign on day 6&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Secondary treatment failure or relapse is defined as appearance of any danger sign or&#xD;
           lower chest indrawing or fast breathing (&gt;or= 50 breaths/min) between day 7 and 14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case management in Control Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care and training for LHWs in the control clusters will be the current&#xD;
      curriculum and training workshops. All LHWs in the control clusters will receive a refresher&#xD;
      in management of ARI through LHW supervisors. They will continue to treat non-severe&#xD;
      pneumonia and other cases of ARI with oral co-trimoxazole. Skills in recognition of severe&#xD;
      pneumonia will be reinforced in the refresher course and LHW will be instructed to continue&#xD;
      to evaluate and refer these cases to the Rural Health Center (RHC) or district general&#xD;
      hospital for admission and treatment (with injectable chloramphenicol or ampicillin) as per&#xD;
      current policy. Patients who refuse to go to any health facility for treatment (either public&#xD;
      or private), will not be offered enhanced home treatment with amoxicillin but will be&#xD;
      provided oral co-trimoxazole as per GoP policy. These children will not be included in final&#xD;
      analysis for treatment failure, but will be recorded in the overall epidemiological data from&#xD;
      the area. Oral cotrimoxazole is provided free of cost per GOP policy. Any compensation for&#xD;
      research related injury including hospitalizations and transportation to and from the health&#xD;
      clinic will be borne by the study. Subjects who develop signs of penicillin allergy will be&#xD;
      treated with an antihistamine at no cost and transported to the local health facility at the&#xD;
      cost of project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case management in Intervention Arm:&#xD;
&#xD;
      LHWs in the intervention clusters will have specific training to enhance their ability to&#xD;
      evaluate and treat ARI. This will include post-training evaluation of their ability to assess&#xD;
      and classify non-severe and severe pneumonia and manage non-severe pneumonia. This will&#xD;
      consist of an improved training module for the LHWs (respiratory care component) with an&#xD;
      amended treatment plan for severe pneumonia with oral amoxicillin. The enhanced respiratory&#xD;
      training module for LHWs will include prompt recognition and referral of study treatment&#xD;
      failures (including very severe disease) by day 3, based on objective criteria of fever and&#xD;
      lower chest indrawing. In the intervention arm LHWs who diagnose severe pneumonia will not&#xD;
      refer the patient to the nearest facility (RHC with admitting facility or district general&#xD;
      hospital), but instead will offer treatment with oral amoxicillin (90 mg/kg/day divided BID)&#xD;
      at home for 5 days with close follow-up. Additionally, these LHWs will continue to treat&#xD;
      non-severe pneumonia entirely in the community with a 3 days course of oral amoxicillin as&#xD;
      per standard of practice. The study drug (oral amoxicillin) is provided free of cost per GOP&#xD;
      policy. Any compensation for research related injury including hospitalizations and&#xD;
      transportation to and from the health clinic will be borne by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For severe pneumonia, oral amoxicillin will be provided as a suspension at a total dose of 90&#xD;
      mg/kg per day for 5 days&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who vomit within a half an hour of oral treatment will receive a repeat dose of&#xD;
      amoxicillin. This will be attempted three times over 30 minutes. If the patient fails three&#xD;
      attempts they will be considered a treatment failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation - Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have calculated a sample size that will allow us to test the following null&#xD;
      hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypothesis: The proportion of children who fail treatment in the treatment group will&#xD;
      not be greater than the proportion of those who fail in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The method of Hayes and Bennett21, which employs the following equations, was used to&#xD;
      calculate the number of clusters. The sample size calculation was then repeated using PASS&#xD;
      software using procedures for cluster randomized equivalency trial Because the number of&#xD;
      clusters was fixed, the investigators calculated the sample size for the trial by solving for&#xD;
      the number of participants required given a set of assumptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      c =2 + (Zα/2 + Zβ)2 * [π0*(1-π0)/n +π1*(1-π1)/n+k2*(π02+π12)]/(π0-π1)2&#xD;
&#xD;
      where π0 = prop int, π1=prop control, n=number per cluster, k=coefficient of variation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Below the investigators detail the assumptions used in sample size calculations and provide&#xD;
      justifications for these assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Failure proportion in control group: The investigators anticipate that the proportion of&#xD;
           children 2-59 months who fail standard of care therapy by day 6 will be 15%. This is&#xD;
           based on the 15% failure proportion found in the APPIS I trial.(11) A consensus among&#xD;
           investigators determined that failure proportion will be lower in this trial because the&#xD;
           definition of failure in APPIS I was overly conservative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Failure proportion in intervention group: The investigators anticipate that the&#xD;
           proportion of children who fail therapy by day 6 in the intervention arm will be 10%.&#xD;
           The null hypothesis is that the proportion of children 2-59 months who fail treatment in&#xD;
           the intervention group will not be greater than the proportion of those who fail in t&#xD;
           control group. Based on a consensus of the investigators, if a difference of 5% or less&#xD;
           is observed in treatment failure between the groups, then the two treatments will be&#xD;
           considered equivalent. This equivalence was considered clinically equivalent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of clusters: The investigators have based the sample size determination on a&#xD;
           total of 18 available clusters (9 per arm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Power: The investigators have used a power of 0.9, setting the Type II error level at&#xD;
           0.1, or a 10% chance of not being able to detect a difference in treatment failure if it&#xD;
           truly existed. This was based on a consensus among the investigators. Power was set high&#xD;
           because this was an equivalency trial, and more emphasis should be placed on making sure&#xD;
           any lack of difference was not based on an underpowered study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Alpha: Based on a consensus of the principal investigators, the null hypothesis will be&#xD;
           rejected based on a one-sided test (because the study focuses only on whether the&#xD;
           intervention is not equivalent to the control), with a p=0.05 level of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Coefficient of variation (k): Inherent correlations between observations in homogeneous&#xD;
           clusters are accounted for in cluster-randomized trials through the coefficient of&#xD;
           variation. The investigators have used an estimate of 0.20 for the study. Hayes and&#xD;
           Bennett21 note that k is typically less than 0.25 for health studies. In this case the&#xD;
           outcome is the proportion of children failing treatment and the investigators therefore&#xD;
           assume that variation in failure rates between clusters will not exhibit great&#xD;
           variation. A coefficient of variation of 0.2 would be equivalent to no cluster in the&#xD;
           control arm having a failure rate below 0.06 or above 0.18.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these assumptions, the investigators conclude that they will need to enroll 290&#xD;
      cases of severe pneumonia per cluster among 9 clusters per arm (total 18 clusters) over two&#xD;
      years, for a total of 5,233 cases of severe pneumonia.&#xD;
