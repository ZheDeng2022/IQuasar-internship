  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Various biological materials have been investigated to determine dietary fatty acid intakes,&#xD;
      such as plasma, erythrocytes, and adipose tissue. The applied techniques are invasive&#xD;
      sampling methods and may have limitations in studies involving infants or young children. In&#xD;
      1985 the group of McMurchie suggested buccal cheek cells as a marker for dietary fatty acid&#xD;
      intake; however fatty acid profiling in cheek cells has not been widely used yet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a clinical intervention trial a new method will be tested. The study will consist of two&#xD;
      consecutive parts: A) a correlation study will investigate the relationship between&#xD;
      established fatty acid markers (red blood cells (RBC), plasma) and the newly proposed markers&#xD;
      (cheek cells) before and after intervention B) an intervention study will investigate the&#xD;
      time depended implementation and steady state of docosahexaenoic acid DHA in plasma, RBC and&#xD;
      cheek cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will receive 520 mg DHA daily over a period of 30 days. Blood and cheek cell&#xD;
      samples will be collected once prior to study commencement and regularly during intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study aims at verifying cheek cell analysis results as a non-invasive marker for&#xD;
      fatty acid profiling. This will be shown by correlation analyses of fatty acids in cheek&#xD;
      cells, erythrocytes and plasma phospholipids. Furthermore, the time kinetics of DHA&#xD;
      incorporation into cheek cells will clarify if cheek cell fatty acids can be considered as a&#xD;
      short or long term marker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new non-invasive method is expected to be extremely valuable as a non-invasive approach&#xD;
      for studying the fatty acid profile in human, including infants and young children.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is of great interest to validate the new method in a clinical trial.&#xD;
