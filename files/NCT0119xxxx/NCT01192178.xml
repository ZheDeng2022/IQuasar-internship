    <textblock>
      Study ADA113872 is an exploratory 16-week multi-centre, randomized, double-blind, parallel&#xD;
      group study in pediatric subjects, 4 to 11 years of age, with a history of seasonal asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation(s). Approximately 40 clinical sites in the United States will randomize 316&#xD;
      subjects. Eligible subjects will be randomly assigned to one of two double-blind treatments&#xD;
      using a 1:1 randomization. Subjects will be identified for their eligibility for enrolment&#xD;
      starting in April 2010. Eligible subjects will be invited to return for randomization into&#xD;
      the study in August 2010. This exploratory study is being conducted to assess whether&#xD;
      treatment with ADVAIR™ DISKUS™ 100/50 mcg is more effective at reducing the risk of&#xD;
      exacerbation and the asthma impairment associated with viral respiratory tract infections&#xD;
      during the fall season when compared to treatment with FLOVENT™ DISKUS™ 100 mcg.&#xD;

      Study ADA113872 will assess the ability of ADVAIR™ DISKUS™ 100/50 mcg, in comparison to&#xD;
      FLOVENT™ DISKUS™ 100 mcg, to reduce worsening asthma associated with viral respiratory&#xD;
      infections during the fall season in a pediatric population. A number of descriptive measures&#xD;
      will be used to assess the reduction in worsening asthma. These include the number of&#xD;
      exacerbations, the duration and severity of asthma symptoms in the 7 days following the&#xD;
      report of moderate upper respiratory tract symptoms or worsening asthma, the number of&#xD;
      rescue-free days, and the rate of asthma control days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be identified starting in April 2010 to evaluate whether they meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria. If a subject is identified as a potential candidate for the study they&#xD;
      will be requested to return to the clinic between August 2, 2010 and August 20, 2010.&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the&#xD;
      study. All subjects must be randomized on or before August 20th, 2010.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be males and females who are between the ages of 4 and 11 years (as of&#xD;
      randomization date) with a documented diagnosis of asthma requiring ICS monotherapy&#xD;
      controller medication or low dose ICS as part of combination controller medication. In order&#xD;
      for a subject on moderate dose ICS or low dose ICS + LABA combination therapy to be eligible&#xD;
      for inclusion in this study their asthma must be under control for the 3 months prior to&#xD;
      randomization and they must be a candidate for step-down therapy as outlined by current&#xD;
      asthma management guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects must have a history of one or more exacerbations during the previous respiratory&#xD;
      viral season that required the use of outpatient oral/parenteral corticosteroid or an urgent&#xD;
      care, Emergency Department visit hospitalization, or for asthma that required the use of&#xD;
      oral/parenteral corticosteroid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive their study medication at the Randomization visit and be instructed to&#xD;
      keep an electronic daily record of AM PEF, asthma symptoms, night-time awakenings due to&#xD;
      asthma, rescue use, and upper respiratory tract infection symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the double-blind treatment period the electronic Diary (eDiary) will alert the subject&#xD;
      or parent/legal guardian when the data imputed into the eDiary indicates the presence of&#xD;
      upper respiratory symptoms of moderate or severe severity or if the subject has reached the&#xD;
      criteria for worsening asthma. Upon receipt of either of these alerts, the subject or&#xD;
      parent/legal guardian will be instructed to call the clinic. The clinic will instruct the&#xD;
      subject (parent/legal guardian) to provide a mucus sample for assessment of viral respiratory&#xD;
      infection. Mucus samples for viral respiratory assessment will not be collected from subjects&#xD;
      more than once in a 7 day period. During the randomization visit subjects will receive&#xD;
      training on the at home collection of a mucus sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study each subject will be instructed to rate their daily upper respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms. Upper respiratory tract symptoms include: runny nose, sneezing, nasal congestion,&#xD;
      and sore throat. Subjects will be instructed to select a rating from the following list that&#xD;
      best describes their aggregate upper respiratory symptoms during the previous 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effects of the ADVAIR™ DISKUS™ 100/50 mcg and FLOVENT™ DISKUS™&#xD;
      100 mcg on clinical parameters and indices of airway inflammation associated with viral&#xD;
      respiratory tract infections in pediatric asthmatic subjects. Safety will be assessed by&#xD;
      monitoring adverse events.&#xD;

        <title>Mean Duration of Worsening Asthma Symptoms Associated With the Presence of Moderate or Severe URTS or a Confirmed RV Infection</title>
        <description>A worsening asthma day is one on which any of the following occurred: rescue albuterol use above baseline, use of oral/parenteral corticosteroids for asthma, use of asthma medication other than study medication, asthma symptom scores &gt;=3, nighttime awakenings, unscheduled health care visits, or missed school due to asthma. The duration of worsening asthma is the number of consecutive worsening asthma days after the date of a URTS score of 2 (moderate) or 3 (severe) or collection of a mucus sample containing RV (whichever occurred first). Each span of consecutive days is a participant interval.</description>
