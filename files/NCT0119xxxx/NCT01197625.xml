  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study the investigators will include patients with high risk of PSA relapse scheduled&#xD;
      to receive curative surgical treatment. This include patients with high Gleason score (9-10)&#xD;
      or micrometastatic disease (tumor cells detected in specimens obtained from bone marrow).&#xD;
      They are scheduled for regular follow-ups with PSA measurements. We have previously published&#xD;
      that some patients with metastatic prostate cancer may respond to DC-vaccination with tumor&#xD;
      mRNA, with a decrease in PSA. PSA response is related to immunological response. Patients&#xD;
      receiving DC-vaccination may have a reduced risk of PSA relapse or increased time to PSA&#xD;
      relapse. Previous experience with different DC-vaccine protocols in our hospital has resulted&#xD;
      in only minor side-effects (grade 1-2 fever, rubor, fatigue, local swelling or pain).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Radical prostatectomy. Preferably accessible tumor tissue with enough volume and&#xD;
             quality for vaccine production (extraction of tumor mRNA).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pathological stage pT2 - pT3b and Gleason score 7B-10, pN0, pN+ or pNx.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be ambulatory with an ECOG performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor cells detected in bone-marrow samples (micrometastatic disease). Patients with&#xD;
             Gleason score 9-10 or pT3b Gleason score 8 may also be included with negative&#xD;
             bone-marrow aspiration. Bone-marrow aspirates and plasma for microRNA will be obtained&#xD;
             before start of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be at least 18 years of age and less than 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PSA &lt; 0.2 µg/L within 6 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have lab values as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        ANC ≥ 1.5 x 109/L; Platelets ≥ 100 x 109/L; Hb ≥ 9 g/dL (≥ 5.6 mmol/L); Creatinine ≤ 140&#xD;
        μmol/L (1.6 mg/dL)- if borderline, the creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min; Bilirubin within&#xD;
        the upper limit of normal; ASAT and ALAT ≤ 2.5 the upper limit of normal; Albumin levels&#xD;
        above lower normal value&#xD;
