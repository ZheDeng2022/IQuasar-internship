    <textblock>
      Total abdominal hysterectomy is known to be associated with operative blood loss, which can&#xD;
      lead to patients' morbidity. Misoprostol, a prostaglandin, has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      reducing operative blood loss during myomectomy. It is the first study to investigate if&#xD;
      preoperative misoprostol is effective in reducing operative blood loss during total abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Uterine leiomyoma is the commonest benign tumour affecting women in their reproductive age.&#xD;
      Around 20-50% can cause symptoms that warrant treatment. Different medical therapies,&#xD;
      including gonadotrophin releasing hormone analogues, mifepristone, progestins and androgens&#xD;
      have been tried. However, most of the medical therapy have significant side-effects that&#xD;
      would only allow a short-term treatment. Total abdominal hysterectomy is the definitive&#xD;
      treatment for large, symptomatic fibroids. Operative mortality of total abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy is rare. However, the operation may be associated with significant morbidities.&#xD;
      Significant operative blood loss that required blood transfusion and oral iron supplement is&#xD;
      not uncommonly encountered after total abdominal hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various methods have been tried to reduce the operative blood loss during total abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy. A course of hormonal therapy for a few months before operation aiming to shrink&#xD;
      the size of fibroid(s) and reduce the vascularity is the commonest approach. Although it is&#xD;
      effective, there are significant side effects and the cost of gonadotrophin releasing hormone&#xD;
      analogues is high. Intramyometrial vasopressin injection has been reported, but serious&#xD;
      complications have been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Misoprostol, a prostaglandin E1 analogue, has been widely used in clinical practice in&#xD;
      obstetrics and gynaecology. It stimulates uterine contractions and this increase in&#xD;
      myometrial contraction will lead to contraction of the vessels supplying blood to the&#xD;
      leiomyomas. Misoprostol has also been shown to increase the uterine artery resistance and&#xD;
      reduce the blood flow to the leiomyomas. Study by Celik et al has shown that pre-operative&#xD;
      misoprostol can reduce intra-operative blood loss and need for post-operative blood&#xD;
      transfusion after abdominal myomectomy. Chang et al investigated the use of misoprostol and&#xD;
      oxytocin in laparoscopy-assisted vaginal hysterectomy and found that the combination of&#xD;
      pre-operative misoprostol and intra-operative oxytocin can reduce blood loss by 200 ml. As&#xD;
      misoprostol can stimulate uterine contraction and reduce uterine blood flow, based on the&#xD;
      hypothesis that pre-operative misoprostol may redistribute the blood from the diseased uterus&#xD;
      back to the circulation hence reducing operative blood loss during total abdominal&#xD;
      hysterectomy, we use a double-blind randomized controlled trial to investigate whether a&#xD;
      single dose of sublingual misoprostol before total abdominal hysterectomy +/-&#xD;
      salpingo-oophorectomy for symptomatic uterine leiomyomas can reduce operative blood loss and&#xD;
      need for post-operative blood transfusion.&#xD;
