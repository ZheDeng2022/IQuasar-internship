      The primary objective is to assess the effect of azelastine hydrochloride (AZE) on the&#xD;
      relative bioavailability (AUC0-∞) of fluticasone propionate (FLU) when administered as fixed&#xD;
      AZE-FLU combination product (TEST) compared to a similar formulation without containing AZE&#xD;
      (i.e. FLU alone in the MP29-02 vehicle; REF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to compare the relative bioavailability (AUC0-∞) of FLU when&#xD;
      administered either as fixed AZE-FLU combination product (TEST) or as marketed FLU product,&#xD;
      Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray, Roxane Laboratories (COMP); To compare the effects of AZE&#xD;
      on other pharmacokinetic parameters of FLU (AUC0 tlast, CL/f, Cmax, tmax, t½); To assess&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;

      This study will enrol healthy subjects. It is considered that study results are more&#xD;
      discriminative in healthy subjects than in rhinitis patients as there are no interferences by&#xD;
      varying rhinitis symptoms and respective differences in the status of the nasal mucosa&#xD;
      regarding the 3 study periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time schedule for serum sampling (pre-dose and 8, 15, 30, 45 min, 1, 1¼, 1½, 2, 2½, 3, 4,&#xD;
      6, 8, 12, and 24 h p.a., time refer to the end of the second spray into the second nostril of&#xD;
      each administration) is derived from previous bioavailability studies assuming a mean tmax of&#xD;
      1 h p.a. [P5] and a mean t1/2 of 3 h [L9]. Sampling times are expected to cover an AUC0-tlast&#xD;
      above 80% of the total AUC of fluticasone propionate (bioanalytical detection method with a&#xD;
      LLOQ of 0.5 pg/mL).&#xD;
