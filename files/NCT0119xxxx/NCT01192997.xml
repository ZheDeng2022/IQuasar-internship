  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is evidence of waning immunity in individuals vaccinated against meningitis C as part&#xD;
      of the UK infant immunisation schedule. The intention of this study is to contact&#xD;
      participants of a previous NVEC (National Vaccine Evalutaion Consortium) clinical trial (a&#xD;
      PreSchool Men C trial, in which participants were randomised to receive Meningitec, Menjugate&#xD;
      or Neisvac-C). They will be invited to enrol and will be randomised to receive one of two&#xD;
      quadrivalent meningococcal ACWY vaccines, to look at the boosting effect they may confer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Between 550 and 650 subjects enrolled in a previous Meningococcal C vaccine study will be&#xD;
      invited to join this new study looking at the boosting effects of two quadrivalent&#xD;
      meningococcal ACWY vaccines. If they choose to participate, they will be randomised to&#xD;
      receive one of the ACWY vaccines. Within each vaccine group, there will be further division&#xD;
      into short (6 months) or longer (9 months) follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be given one dose of an allocated vaccine. Blood samples will be taken&#xD;
      three times from each participant - the first sample will be pre-vaccination; the second&#xD;
      sample will be taken one month after vaccination; and the third and final sample at either&#xD;
      six or nine months after vaccination (depending on the group they are randomised to).&#xD;
