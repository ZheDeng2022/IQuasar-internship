      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) RA is characterized by joint inflammation causing peripheral pain,&#xD;
      however the relation between peripheral pathology and pain intensity is weak. There is&#xD;
      substantial evidence that also pain modulation mechanisms are dysregulated in RA. For&#xD;
      example, generalized pain frequency is higher in RA than in normal population, about 15%&#xD;
      compared to 3%. Earlier data from our group show a changed pattern of pain-modulation in&#xD;
      established RA compared to early RA and controls (Keystone 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several treatments in RA directed at relieving symptoms (NSAIDs) as well as&#xD;
      modifying disease (DMARDs and biologics). One of the established biologics is the Tumor&#xD;
      Necrosis Factor (TNF)-blocking agent adalimumab which has proven efficacious for decreasing&#xD;
      disease activity and retardation of joint destruction in RA (Keystone 2004, Weinblatt 2006).&#xD;
      In addition, adalimumab has proven efficient in reduction of fatigue in RA (Yount 2007)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain mechanisms in rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain in RA has traditionally been regarded as nociceptive pain due to peripheral inflammation&#xD;
      of joints (arthritis). However, although affected joints are typically inflamed and swollen,&#xD;
      peripheral pathology cannot fully explain the amount of pain a patient experiences (Thompson&#xD;
      1997). Central nervous system (CNS) mechanisms have been implicated in the pain experience by&#xD;
      RA patients and we have previously been able to demonstrate a generalised increase in pain&#xD;
      sensitivity in RA patients (Leffler 2002). The importance of CNS changes in endogenous pain&#xD;
      modulation (i.e, facilitation, central sensitisation/disinhibition) is further underscored by&#xD;
      the high co-morbidity between RA and generalised pain syndromes such as fibromyalgia&#xD;
      (FM)(Neumann and Buskila 2003), where specific dysfunctions of endogenous pain modulation&#xD;
      have been documented. The pronounced co-morbidity between FM and rheumatic inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases, and the fact that a generalised increase in pain sensitivity has been reported in&#xD;
      patients with long (&gt; 5 years) but not short (&lt; 1 year) duration of RA (Leffler 2002) suggest&#xD;
      that disturbances in pain modulation can also be important for pain perception in many&#xD;
      patients with RA. Endogenous pain inhibitory mechanisms are physiologically closely linked to&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system activity. The same type of autonomic nervous system dysfunction&#xD;
      (i.e., basal sympathetic hyperactivity and hyporeactivity) has been reported in RA patients&#xD;
      (Evrengul 2004, Goldstein 2007) and FM patients (Cohen 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides pain regulation, recent studies have focused on the involvement of autonomic tone&#xD;
      also in systemic inflammatory responses. A major breakthrough was the characterization of the&#xD;
      cholinergic anti-inflammatory pathway. Efferent activity in the vagus nerve leads to systemic&#xD;
      release of acetylcholine (ACh). Specific binding to alfa 7 nicotinic ACh receptors on tissue&#xD;
      macrophages efficiently inhibits the release of proinflammatory substances such as TNF, IL-1,&#xD;
      IL-6 and IL-8 (Tracey 2002). This inflammatory reflex pathway is rapid, localized and&#xD;
      integrated in contrast to the well defined humoral regulation of inflammation. Dysfunction of&#xD;
      autonomic regulation, with a relative reduction of vagal tone is a feature of RA and proven&#xD;
      to correlate with systemic levels of inflammatory cytokines (Goldstein 2007). The importance&#xD;
      of interaction between autonomic pain regulation and neural anti-inflammatory pathways is&#xD;
      indicated by several findings. Flight-or-fight responses activated by pain can result in&#xD;
      increase of epinephrine and norepinephrine, that can inhibit macrophage activation and&#xD;
      regulate TNF secretion (Tracey 2002). Moreover, a reduction of antiinflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      (IL-4 and IL-10) (Uceyler 2006) and an increase in pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF, IL-1,&#xD;
      IL6, IL-8) have been shown in syndromes characterized by generalized pain (Salemi 2003,&#xD;
      Bazzichi 2007). Thus, these data indicate that modulation of systemic and chronic&#xD;
      inflammation may have significant effects on pain processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years increasing focus has been placed upon the interactions between the immune&#xD;
      system and the CNS with the recognition of an immune - to brain pathway activating the&#xD;
      sickness response. In addition to blood-borne signalling, neural pathways via the sensory&#xD;
      vagus and glossopharyngeal nerves have been identified (Watkins 2005). Recent animal studies&#xD;
      have revealed that peripheral inflammation, nociceptive input as well as pronounced mental&#xD;
      stress can activate microglia cells throughout the CNS and that these stimulated microglia&#xD;
      cells start to produce pro-inflammatory substances (TNF, IL-&#xD;
&#xD;
      1, IL-6). These substances initiate central inflammatory changes with increased pain&#xD;
      sensitivity (allodynia, hyperalgesia and most likely spontaneously ongoing pain) as a result&#xD;
      (Milligan 2009, Beattie 2002). Moreover, intrathecal administration of substances&#xD;
      potentiating release of antiinflammatory cytokines such as IL-10, have been proven&#xD;
      efficiently analgesic (Johnston 2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These data are in accordance with recent results where collagen induced arthritis resulted in&#xD;
      a decrease in the threshold for thermal and mechanical stimuli, beginning on the day of&#xD;
      onset. This was accompanied by increased inflammatory response in spinal cord astrocytes, and&#xD;
      treatment with anti-TNF was both profoundly analgesic and also restored inflammatory changes&#xD;
      in astrocytes (Inglis JJ 2007). These results thus indicate that pain regulation may be&#xD;
      influenced by peripheral inflammation and can also be reversed by potent anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altogether, understanding the relationship between peripheral nociceptive input (due to&#xD;
      inflamed joints), autonomic NS activity, endogenous pain modulatory systems and CNS&#xD;
      inflammation for the symptoms in patients with RA is important and can lead to improved&#xD;
      strategies in treatment of pain mechanisms as well as fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging Pain can be conceptualised as a primarily motivational state to induce a behavioural&#xD;
      drive with the purpose to restore homeostasis. The multidimensionality of pain perception is&#xD;
      supported by studies using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assess cerebral&#xD;
      activation during stimulus-evoked pain in human subjects. These studies have documented&#xD;
      activation of brain areas traditionally associated with the perception of sensory features&#xD;
      (e.g. somatosensory cortices) and regions associated with emotional and motivational aspects&#xD;
      of pain (prefrontal cortex (PFC), anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and insular cortex (IC)).&#xD;
      In addition, brain areas involved in the regulation of autonomic nervous system and&#xD;
      endogenous pain modulation are also activated. In a recent fMRI study of patients with&#xD;
      chronic low back pain (LBP) activation of the somatosensory cortex was only seen during brief&#xD;
      periods of spontaneously increasing pain intensity. During periods of ongoing LBP only brain&#xD;
      regions of importance for emotional and cognitive aspects of pain (i.e. prefrontal cortex and&#xD;
      cingulate) were activated (Baliki 2006). These findings indicate that the perception of&#xD;
      chronic, ongoing pain requires very limited involvement of the pure somatosensory areas.&#xD;
      These results are in accordance with two recent positron emission tomography (PET) studies of&#xD;
      joint pain. In patients with pain due to knee osteoarthritis, increased activity was reported&#xD;
      in the prefrontal cortex, cingulate and insula during arthritic pain compared to experimental&#xD;
      heat pain (Kulkarni 2007). Accordingly, in another PET study, Schweinhardt et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Schweinhardt 2008) reported a stronger activation in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in&#xD;
      response to provoked joint pain in RA patients compared to experimental heat pain. The&#xD;
      results were interpreted as increased activation of areas implicated in emotional and&#xD;
      cognitive processing of noxious stimuli, reflecting the greater emotional salience of&#xD;
      clinical pain compared to experimental pain and the importance of coping strategies&#xD;
      potentially influencing the perception of chronic pain. In healthy volunteers, activation of&#xD;
      the prefrontal cortex is related to the degree of anxiety during the experience of&#xD;
      experimental pain (Ochsner 2006) and the prefrontal cortex has been reported to be more&#xD;
      consistently activated in studies of clinical pain compared to studies of experimental pain&#xD;
      (Apkarian 2005). Little is known about the relation between cerebral pain related activity,&#xD;
      clinical symptoms, degree of systemic inflammation and various coping strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study We hypothesise that RA patients have a generalised increase in pain&#xD;
      sensitivity (i.e., not restricted to inflamed joints) and that this increase in pain&#xD;
      sensitivity is mediated through increased central nervous system inflammation affecting the&#xD;
      ability to recruit endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms in a negative way. Furthermore, we&#xD;
      hypothesise that treatment with TNF antagonists, in addition to reductions in peripheral&#xD;
      inflammation, also affect central nervous system inflammation and improve the ability to&#xD;
      activate endogenous pain modulatory mechanisms thus reducing pain and other symptoms (i.e.,&#xD;
      fatigue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study adresses the following questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Do patients with RA exhibit an increased sensitivity to randomized painful stimulation&#xD;
           at an inflamed joint and at a neutral painfree area, resp., compared to healthy&#xD;
           controls?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Does the cerebral activation pattern assessed by fMRI differ between patients and&#xD;
           controls during experimental painful stimulation at a painful (inflamed joint) and a&#xD;
           non-painful (thumbnail) area?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Can disturbances in autonomic nervous system activity be linked to the pain sensitivity,&#xD;
           cerebral processing of noxious stimuli and/or the degree of inflammation in RA patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Can the subjective perception of fatigue be related to any of the following; pain&#xD;
           sensitivity, abnormalities in cerebral pain processing, inflammatory parameters and&#xD;
           autonomic activity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How are the above parameters affected by treatment with a TNF antagonist (adalimumab)&#xD;
           compared to placebo?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with active RA and incomplete response to methotrexate (MTX) will be recruited to&#xD;
      the study as well as healthy clinical subjects. RA patients and controls will be compared&#xD;
      concerning pain pressure thresholds, pain processing using brain fMRI, activity in the&#xD;
      autonomous nerve system and inflammatory markers in blood samples as well as assessment of&#xD;
      pain, fatigue using standardized assessments. Following inclusion, patients with RA will be&#xD;
      randomized into active treatment (A) and placebo control group (B) using standardized&#xD;
      procedures for randomized, double blind, placebo controlled studies. The treatment group will&#xD;
      receive adalimumab directly following the baseline assessment and subsequently eow during the&#xD;
      study. The placebo control group will receive placebo injections at baseline, two weeks and&#xD;
      at four weeks and subsequently adalimumab. The overall aim with the study is to obtain&#xD;
      increased knowledge concerning pain processing and fatigue in RA, and how these conditions&#xD;
      are influenced by treatment with TNF blockade with adalimumab.&#xD;
