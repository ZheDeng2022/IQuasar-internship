    <textblock>
      Background: Recent single arm studies have suggested that partial breast irradiation (PBI),&#xD;
      delivered in a relatively short overall treatment time of a few days, may be an effective&#xD;
      alternative to adjuvant whole breast irradiation (WBI) delivered over a number of weeks.&#xD;
      Several PBI modalities and techniques have been investigated, including interstitial&#xD;
      brachytherapy and external beam radiation therapy, most often given over the course of one&#xD;
      week of twice daily outpatient treatments. One randomized study has shown equivalency between&#xD;
      WBI and PBI using brachytherapy. There are currently three large phase-III randomized studies&#xD;
      comparing PBI to WBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permanent Breast Seed Implant (PBSI) is the newest PBI technique which has been piloted at&#xD;
      the Odette Cancer Centre (OCC) in Toronto. The main advantage of this technique is that it&#xD;
      requires only one out-patient procedure. The treatment is administered by implanting&#xD;
      radioactive Palladium (103Pd) seeds into the tumor bed region in a 1 to Â½ hour outpatient&#xD;
      procedure, after which the patient is discharged home to resume her normal living activities.&#xD;
      This PBI procedure was shown to be well tolerated with minimal acute toxicity. Estimated&#xD;
      partner radiation exposure was well within internationally acceptable levels. Subjects with a&#xD;
      seroma &gt;2cm were, however, excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: PBSI is a feasible, safe, and acceptable treatment option for the subject and her&#xD;
      partner in the context of medical practice and resources in BC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: In subjects who have undergone breast conserving surgery for early breast cancer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the technical feasibility of PBSI in BC&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure the subject's partner in terms of radiation protection&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate acceptability of PBSI by the subject&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To assess resource requirements for PBSI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: This is a single arm feasibility study. Five women who had undergone breast&#xD;
      conserving surgery for breast cancer with low risk of local recurrence will be accrued. This&#xD;
      study will adhere to a detailed written protocol for radiation measurements and protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo PBSI within 4-14 weeks from last breast surgery. The procedure will be&#xD;
      performed in an outpatient setting, under conscious sedation and local anesthesia, by a team&#xD;
      with a wide brachytherapy experience. The technique used in this feasibility study will be&#xD;
      based on the OCC technique. It is intended that two oncologists and one physicist will spend&#xD;
      2-3 days at the OCC to acquire detailed and firsthand knowledge of the technique as&#xD;
      implemented at that centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OCC technique is US-based; in this study, however, an additional CT-assisted planning&#xD;
      component will be investigated building on the experience of the VIC team which conducted the&#xD;
      BC Cancer Agency Vancouver Island Centre's pilot study of CT-based multi-catheter&#xD;
      brachytherapy PBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic therapy will be according to BCCA guidelines; however, subjects requiring adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy will be excluded from this study. Subjects will be followed prospectively for 5&#xD;
      years for evaluation of toxicity, QOL and cosmesis. Disease status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance: Completing adjuvant breast irradiation with a single out-patient treatment could&#xD;
      significantly improve QOL and convenience for patients choosing breast conserving therapy.&#xD;
      Confirming the technical feasibility and safety of PBSI is needed before progressing to&#xD;
      larger prospective evaluation of this novel adjuvant radiation therapy technique as a viable&#xD;
      treatment option for women in British Columbia.&#xD;

    <description>Target Volumes: The surgical cavity will be assessed with US &amp; CT scans. The Clinical Target Volume (CTV) will encompass the surgical cavity plus 1 cm uniform expansion. The Planning Target Volume (PTV) will be the CTV plus 0.5 cm.&#xD;

Implant Procedure and QA: This will be performed as an outpatient procedure under conscious sedation and local anesthesia, by a team with several years experience in brachytherapy and conscious sedation administration. The technique used in this pilot study will be based on the OCC technique. It is intended that two oncologists and one physicist will spend 2-3 days at the OCC to acquire detailed and firsthand knowledge of the technique and its implementation at that centre.</description>
