  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of behavioral weight&#xD;
      loss as a treatment for migraine in obese females aged 18 to 50 years. The primary aim is to&#xD;
      examine whether participants assigned to a behavioral weight loss treatment condition report&#xD;
      greater pre- to post-treatment reductions in migraine headache frequency than participants&#xD;
      assigned to a migraine education condition.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Migraine is a highly prevalent, debilitating and costly disorder. Eighteen percent of women&#xD;
      and 6% of men are affected by migraine; a neurovascular disorder characterized by severe&#xD;
      recurrent headache pain episodes involving nausea, photophobia, phonophobia and aversion to&#xD;
      physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing evidence that obesity exacerbates migraine. Obesity is associated with&#xD;
      more frequent headaches in episodic migraineurs, and is a risk factor for progression to&#xD;
      chronic migraine. Several plausible mechanisms have been proposed to underlie the&#xD;
      migraine-obesity link including common pro-inflammatory processes, psychological conditions&#xD;
      that are comorbid to both disorders (e.g., depression), and similar behavioral risk factors&#xD;
      (e.g., low physical activity and high fat intake).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No research to date has examined the impact of standard behavioral weight loss programs on&#xD;
      migraine in obese adults. Behavioral weight loss programs focused on improving diet and&#xD;
      physical activity consistently produce weight losses of 8-10 kg at 6 months which reduces the&#xD;
      risk of diabetes and improves cardiovascular disease risk factors. Weight loss may also&#xD;
      improve each of the physiological, psychological, and behavioral pathways that purportedly&#xD;
      link migraine and obesity. Thus, behavioral weight loss programs may serve as an innovative&#xD;
      approach to treating migraine headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves a randomized controlled trial to examine the efficacy of behavioral&#xD;
      weight loss as a treatment for migraine. One hundred and forty obese females who meet&#xD;
      research criteria for migraine, as confirmed by a study neurologist and completion of an&#xD;
      electronic headache diary will be assigned to 16 weekly group sessions of either: (1)&#xD;
      Behavioral weight loss (BWL) treatment (n=70) or (2) Healthy Living for Migraine Relief&#xD;
      (HLMR) education (n=70). BWL will provide a combination of empirically validated diet and&#xD;
      exercise prescriptions and behavior change strategies such as self-monitoring, goal-setting&#xD;
      and stimulus control. HLMR will provide education on migraine and pharmacological and&#xD;
      behavioral (e.g., stress management) treatments. Both groups will use smartphones to record&#xD;
      their headaches for 4 weeks at a time during pre-treatment, post-treatment, and the end of a&#xD;
      16-week weight maintenance period. Weight and other potential physiological (inflammation),&#xD;
      psychological (depression), and behavioral (diet and physical activity) mediators of the&#xD;
      treatment effect will be assessed at the end of treatment for tests of prospective effects on&#xD;
      migraine days at post-treatment. The primary hypothesis is that BWL participants will report&#xD;
      greater pre- to post-treatment reductions in number of migraine days than HLMR participants.&#xD;
