  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of giving 1-methyl-d-tryptophan&#xD;
      and docetaxel together in treating patients with metastatic solid tumors. Biological&#xD;
      therapies, such as 1-methyl-d-tryptophan, may stop the growth of tumor cells by stimulating&#xD;
      the immune system and by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving 1-methyl-d-tryptophan&#xD;
      with chemotherapy may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The MTD of the 1-MT/docetaxel combination using CTCAE 4.0 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determination of PK data for the combination of docetaxel plus oral 1-MT.Overall objective&#xD;
      response rate (CR, PR) per RECIST criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral 1-methyl-d-tryptophan twice daily on days 1-21 and docetaxel IV over 1&#xD;
      hour on day 1 (in course one patients receive 1-methyl-d-tryptophan once daily on days 1 and&#xD;
      3-21). Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected periodically for pharmacokinetic and correlative studies.&#xD;
