  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to select targeted treatment based on ex vivo kinase activity&#xD;
      inhibition profiles to targeted agents of tumor tissue from patients with advanced cancer for&#xD;
      whom no standard treatment is available.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific signalling proteins that are important for tumor growth can be targeted by agents.&#xD;
      These are called targeted agents or targeted treatment. Thus far, it is unclear which&#xD;
      patients will respond to these targeted agents. It is assumed that responses to these agents&#xD;
      depend on specific receptor and protein signalling activities in tumor tissues. The&#xD;
      investigators propose that kinase activity profiling may be a potential clinical diagnostic&#xD;
      tool to predict tumor response to targeted treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine ex vivo kinase activity inhibition profiles of tumor tissue&#xD;
      to different targeted agents. Tumor tissue from patients with advanced cancer for whom no&#xD;
      standard treatment is available will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated with the selected targeted agent and the clinical benefit will be&#xD;
      determined.&#xD;
