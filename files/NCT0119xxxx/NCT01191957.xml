      The purpose of this prospective phase III, open-label, randomized multicenter study is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) elderly patients in Complete Remission (CR)&#xD;
      undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation after a reduce toxicity&#xD;
      conditioning regimen (I.V. BuFlu) as compared to the conventional I.V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BuCy2 program will experience:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A lower transplant-related mortality (TRM) at 1 year after Hematopoietic Stem Cells&#xD;
           Transplant (HSCT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A similar anti-leukemic activity and a similar or better safety profile, in terms of:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Early and/or late graft rejection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hematopoietic and immunologic recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Chimerism&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Toxicity and incidence of Veno-occlusive Disease (VOD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Acute (aGvHD) and chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGvHD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cumulative incidence of TRM at +100 days and 2 years after transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cumulative incidence of relapse by 1 and 2 years after transplant&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT) is a potentially curative treatment modality&#xD;
      for patients with Acute Myelogenous Leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An effective conditioning regimen is based on the association of oral Busulfan 4 mg/kg daily&#xD;
      in 4 doses, each of 1 mg/kg, on each of 4 successive days (total dose, 16 mgkg), followed by&#xD;
      CY 60 mg/kg intravenously on each of 2 successive days (BuCy2). The antileukemic activity of&#xD;
      this latter program was tested and confirmed in most large randomized clinical trials&#xD;
      conducted in AML and Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) patients in which the BU-CY regimen was&#xD;
      associated with survival and relapse probabilities that compare favourably with the CY-Total&#xD;
      Body Irradiation (TBI) regimen. The BuCy2 program is considered a golden standard preparative&#xD;
      regimen for allogeneic transplantation in AML patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, for many years the treatment related toxicities of all these full myeloablative&#xD;
      conditioning regimens has substantially limited the overall applicability of the transplant&#xD;
      procedure to young patients with a good performance status (PS). The observation that&#xD;
      allogeneic stem cell transplants have a potentially curative graft-versus-leukemia (GVL)&#xD;
      effect in addition to the antileukemic action of myeloablative conditioning regimens was a&#xD;
      major stimulus for the development of reduced-intensity conditioning (RIC) regimens, aimed&#xD;
      primarily at securing engraftment to provide the GVL effect, while minimizing regimen-related&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observation that allogeneic stem cell transplants have a potentially curative&#xD;
      graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect in addition to the antileukemic action of myeloablative&#xD;
      conditioning regimens was a major stimulus for the development of reduced-intensity&#xD;
      conditioning (RIC) regimens, aimed primarily at securing engraftment to provide the GVL&#xD;
      effect, while minimizing regimen-related toxicity. As a consequence reduced-intensity&#xD;
      conditioning (RIC) regimens might give possibility to extend access to allogeneic&#xD;
      transplantation to patients who would not have previously been considered reasonable&#xD;
      candidates because of their age and for the presence of comorbidities. However, after a lot&#xD;
      of initial enthusiasm, it has become clear that a more intensive conditioning is associated&#xD;
      with a reduced risk for relapse after HSCT. Therefore, while it is clear that RIC transplants&#xD;
      have opened the way to using allogeneic SCT in patients several years older than the upper&#xD;
      age limit of 60, the superiority of the RIC approach cannot be assumed even in this subgroup&#xD;
      of patients. This is why, more recently, investigators are looking for conditioning programs&#xD;
      that while better tolerated still might retain a strong ability of inducing a direct ablation&#xD;
      of the leukemic hematopoiesis. This has led to the new concept of reduced toxicity rather&#xD;
      than reduced intensity conditioning programs. One of such a program is based on the&#xD;
      association of a myeloablative dose of intravenous Busulfan (0.8 mg/kg/d for 4 days), with&#xD;
      Fludarabine (30 mg/m2/d for 4 days) which has been reported as highly effective in patients&#xD;
      with AML. In elderly patients with this disease, this program might lead to an overall&#xD;
      outcome at least as good as that following conventional myeloablative programs such as those&#xD;
      based on Cyclophosphamide combined to the same dose of IV Busulfan or the TBI. In fact, when&#xD;
      compared to these latter programs, the Busulfan Fludarabine regimen was found associated with&#xD;
      lower non relapse mortality although a higher relapse rate was still documented, but not in&#xD;
      all published experiences. In all, outcomes for standard transplant regimens have generally&#xD;
      improved and these newer myeloablative regimens of Fludarabine with full-dose intravenous&#xD;
      Busulfan achieve 1 year TRM below 10%. So, based on these considerations, protocol&#xD;
      GITMO-AML.R2 has been designed to compare intravenous Busulfan plus Fludarabine (BuFlu)&#xD;
      versus Busulfan (I.V. Bu; Busilvex®) plus Cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) as conditioning regimens&#xD;
      prior to allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation (alloHSCT) in patients (aged&#xD;
      between 40 and 65 years) with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) in Complete Remission (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, based on these considerations, protocol GITMO-AML.R2 has been designed to compare&#xD;
      intravenous Busulfan plus Fludarabine (BuFlu) versus Busulfan (I.V. Bu; Busilvex®) plus&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide (BuCy2) as conditioning regimens prior to allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell&#xD;
      Transplantation (alloHSCT) in patients (aged between 40 and 65 years) with Acute Myeloid&#xD;
      Leukemia (AML) in Complete Remission (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of this trial is the evaluation of one year transplant-related&#xD;
      mortality (TRM) of AML patients undergoing allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation&#xD;
      after a reduced toxicity conditioning regimen (I.V.BuFlu) as compared to the conventional&#xD;
      I.V. BuCy2 program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose, in the IV BuCy2 arm, reference TRM was assumed to be 25% (range 16-50%)&#xD;
      while in the IV BuFlu arm and an estimated 12.5% TRM is assumed (range 0-30%). The study is&#xD;
      designed to demonstrate a relative risk reduction of 50%. For the event-driven two-sided&#xD;
      test, an alpha-level probability of 0.05 (type I error) and a power of 80% (type II&#xD;
      error=0.2) has been considered. The ratio between the numbers of patients included in each&#xD;
      arm is set equal to 1:1. The resulting required sample size is 240 (120 patients in each&#xD;
      arm). Sample size estimation is based on the intention-to-treat principle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The accrual time is 2.5 years, and an additional follow-up of 2 years is planned after the&#xD;
      last patient entry in the study and before the final analysis.&#xD;
