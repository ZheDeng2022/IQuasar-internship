      The primary objective of the study is to find the gene(s) responsible for causing DDH. The&#xD;
      secondary objective of the study is to determine the mode of genetic transmission of DDH.&#xD;

      Developmental dysplasia of the hip (DDH), formerly known as Congenital Dislocation of the Hip&#xD;
      (CDH) is a relatively common disorder that can lead to early onset arthritis of the hip. It&#xD;
      is believed that DDH is the major cause of arthritis of the hip in young patients. The&#xD;
      majority of patients with DDH are unaware of their condition. Only a very small number of&#xD;
      these patients with the extremely severe form of the disease (dislocated hip) are identified&#xD;
      at birth. The remaining patients usually seek help when severe arthritis is present and joint&#xD;
      preservation treatment is not possible. The exact etiology of this condition remains elusive.&#xD;
      Based on reports in the literature, DDH is believed to have a genetic basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dr. Javad Parvizi at Rothman Institute (RT) in Philadelphia has extensive experience with&#xD;
      this condition because their center provides joint preservation procedures such as pelvic and&#xD;
      femoral osteotomy. They also have extensive experience with hip replacement in these&#xD;
      patients. They are aware of some families with many affected individuals. Close history&#xD;
      taking and examination of these patients has suggested that there may indeed be a genetic&#xD;
      basis for DDH. Based on our findings so far, we believe that a dominant pattern of&#xD;
      inheritance may exist, implying that this disorder may be inherited in a Mendelian manner&#xD;
      (Single gene disorder).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, Dr. Parvizi's group have documented a peculiar pattern of dominant inheritance&#xD;
      in which all affected males give rise to only affected female children, suggesting that the&#xD;
      disorder may be inherited as an X-linked dominant trait. X-linked dominant is the mode of&#xD;
      inheritance in which a gene on the X chromosome is dominant. The X-linked dominant&#xD;
      inheritance may in part account for the large number of females affected with the trait.&#xD;
      Understanding the inheritance mechanism of this disease will allow better genetic counseling&#xD;
      and monitoring of affected individuals and their families.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason behind this study is to investigate the possible genetic inheritance of the&#xD;
      disease. Knowing this information will allow us to test patients for the disease early and&#xD;
      before arthritis develops. In addition it is possible that better treatments may be designed&#xD;
      based on this knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DDH is a relatively common condition. Although the most severe form of DDH is usually&#xD;
      diagnosed during birth (dislocated hip), the majority (&gt;80%) of patients with this condition&#xD;
      do not even know that they suffer from this disease and usually discover their condition when&#xD;
      disabling arthritis of the hip develops in early adulthood.&#xD;
