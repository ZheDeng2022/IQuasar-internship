  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to learn why some black and Latino men and women choose not to&#xD;
      exercise very often. Researchers also want to learn more about any social and environmental&#xD;
      factors that may affect the way an exercise program is followed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you chose to take part in this study, you will receive an exercise program, a pedometer,&#xD;
      access to a social networking site, and newsletters to help you start becoming more&#xD;
      physically active. A pedometer is a small device worn on the hip that counts the number of&#xD;
      steps you have taken each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will come in for study visits 6 times while you are on study; 1 time at the beginning of&#xD;
      the study called &quot;screening&quot;, 1 time for an orientation visit 7 days after the screening&#xD;
      visit, and for follow-up visits at 8, 26, 39, and 52 weeks after you begin the exercise&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part on this study based on the results of the&#xD;
      screening tests, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to complete a computer-based survey. The questionnaires will ask&#xD;
           questions about stress, your motivation for physical activity, any social support you&#xD;
           may receive from others, the neighborhood you live in, and other physical&#xD;
           activity-related topics. The questionnaires should take about 2 hours total to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your height, weight, and waistline will be measured. To measure your waistline&#xD;
           accurately, you may be asked to lift your shirt to expose your stomach area and to lower&#xD;
           your pants to expose your mid-hip area. Waistline measurements will only take about 10&#xD;
           minutes to complete and will be performed in a private area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a fitness test. To complete the fitness test, you will either walk a&#xD;
           circular path at the clinic for 6 minutes or complete a step test. The study staff will&#xD;
           decide which test you will complete and will discuss the test with you in more detail. A&#xD;
           study staff member will monitor you during this test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, you will be given the following study devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a smartphone to take home with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will fill out a set of questions on the smartphone each time you exercise. The&#xD;
           questions will ask about the kind physical activity you are participating in, the&#xD;
           location of where the physical activity is taking place, and the weather conditions&#xD;
           outside. These questions will take about 1-2 minutes per day. Also, the smartphone will&#xD;
           &quot;beep&quot; at random times (3 times per day) and set times (in the morning and evening)&#xD;
           throughout the day to prompt you to answer a set of questions about your thoughts and&#xD;
           feelings. The device will also automatically record your location using a Global&#xD;
           Positioning System (GPS) during the time you are carrying the phone. This will take&#xD;
           about 7-8 minutes per day. The research staff will call you 1 time each week to remind&#xD;
           you to use the smartphone and will help with any smartphone problems that may occur.&#xD;
           Each reminder phone call should last about 3 minutes. You will return the smartphone&#xD;
           with you at the orientation visit for the study staff to download your answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given an accelerometer. You will wear the accelerometer for 7 days and then&#xD;
           return it at the orientation study visit. An accelerometer is a small device that is&#xD;
           worn on your hip that measures the amount of physical activity you do.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Orientation Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the orientation study visit, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a newsletter that contains information and strategies to help you&#xD;
           start your exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a smartphone again to take home.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a physical activity (PA) prescription. The PA prescription outlines&#xD;
           your exercise program and has instructions on the proper way to walk to decrease the&#xD;
           chance of getting an injury. You will be instructed to start your PA prescription and&#xD;
           carry the smartphone with you for 2 weeks. After 2weeks, you will return the smartphone&#xD;
           by mail in a prepaid envelope that will be provided to you by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a pedometer to wear when you are ready to start your PA prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 8, 26, 39, and 52 Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of these study visits, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will return the accelerometer at each visit for the study staff to review, and you&#xD;
           will take it home at the end of each visit. The staff member will provide you with the&#xD;
           device at your Week 8 visit and you will receive an envelope for return. The smartphone&#xD;
           will also be given to you at Weeks 26 and 39, and you will be required to mail it back.&#xD;
           For Week 52 you will receive the device 1 week before and return it at your Week 52&#xD;
           visit. You should tell a research staff member right away about any problems you may&#xD;
           have using the smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete the computer-based survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your blood pressure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your height, weight, and waistline will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive phone calls between study visits to remind you to complete the questions on&#xD;
      the smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the Weeks 26 and 52 study visits, in addition to the tests and procedures listed above,&#xD;
      you will complete the fitness test again and return the smartphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will remain in the study for up to 1 year. Your participation on this study will be over&#xD;
      after you complete the study visit at Week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Information:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may be contacted by phone, mail, text messaging, and/or email at any time while you are&#xD;
      taking part in this study to be reminded about the study visits. You will be asked to give&#xD;
      the names and contact information of family members and/or friends for the study staff to&#xD;
      contact in the event they cannot reach you first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 300 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;
