  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing whipples pancreaticoduodenectomy tend to develop delayed gastric&#xD;
      emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study compares two types of anastamosis of stomach to jejunum (supracolic and infracolic)&#xD;
      and compares whether it influences the gastric emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical evidence of delayed gastric emptying is correlated with objective evidence of&#xD;
      liquid and solid emptying by radionuclide study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study also tries to evaluate whether pancreatic leak correlates with delayed gastric&#xD;
      emptying&#xD;

      METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized control trial includes all patients undergoing whipples&#xD;
      pancreaticoduodenectomy st Asian Institute of Gastroenterology. All patients were randomized&#xD;
      by a closed envelope technique. The envelope was opened after complete resection of the&#xD;
      specimen and then allocating the patients into either of the two groups, Group A- Infracolic&#xD;
      Gastrojejunostomy, Group B- Supracolic Gastrojejunostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients undergoing whipples pancreaticoduodenectomy, who consented for the trial&#xD;
           and found to be resectable at surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unresectable tumors at surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in whom gastric emptying studies could not be done due to any reason&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documented Mechanical obstruction at Gastrojejunal anastamosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post operative mortality due to other causes&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the resection, a Roux loop of jejunum is prepared and taken up through a rent in the&#xD;
      transverse mesocolon to which an end to side Hepaticojejunostomy followed by&#xD;
      Pancreaticojejunostomy is done in both the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group A Infracolic gastrojejunostomy is done in the infracolic compartment to the same&#xD;
      loop of jejunum after pulling the stomach down through another rent in the transverse&#xD;
      mesocolon to the left of middle colic artery, thereby compartmentalizing or separating&#xD;
      gastrojejunostomy from Hepaticojejunostomy and pancreaticojejunostomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Group B Supracolic gastrojejunostomy is done in the supracolic compartment to the same&#xD;
      Roux loop of jejunum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients undergo a feeding jejunostomy. Postoperatively all the patients were managed&#xD;
      according to a standard protocol, daily monitoring of Ryle's tube output and drain fluid&#xD;
      output was recorded. Drain fluid amylase levels and serum amylase levels were estimated on&#xD;
      postoperative day 3, 5 and 7. Ryle's tube was removed if the output was &lt;200ml in 24hrs after&#xD;
      confirming that the tube was patent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral feeds were started after removal of Ryle's tube, initially with liquids followed by&#xD;
      semisolids and then normal diet. Patient's daily intake is recorded. Any adverse event of&#xD;
      vomiting, abdominal distension and succussion splash was recorded by the person blinded about&#xD;
      the technique of anastamosis. If there was clinical suspicion of gastric outlet obstruction,&#xD;
      Ryle's tube was placed and output recorded. If mechanical cause for gastric outlet&#xD;
      obstruction was suspected, then contrast study and/or gastroscopy was done to confirm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graded enteral nutrition was started in all the patients from post operative day 3 through&#xD;
      the feeding jejunostomy tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any medications effecting GI motility were avoided till the gastric emptying studies were&#xD;
      performed&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically delayed gastric emptying was defined according to International study group of&#xD;
      pancreatic Surgeons (ISGPS), as Grade A, B and C. Pancreatic fistula was defined based on&#xD;
      International Study Group on Pancreatic Fistula (ISGPF) as Grade A, B and C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radio isotope gastric emptying studies were done for both liquids and solids on postoperative&#xD;
      day 7 &amp; 8 respectively. Test was performed and interpreted by the investigator who is blinded&#xD;
      about the type of anastamosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end the groups will be analyzed whether they were comparable with regard to the age,&#xD;
      sex and diagnosis. The gastric emptying (Clinical, liquid meal and solid meal emptying) will&#xD;
      be compared between both procedure groups. Correlation of clinical evidence of gastric&#xD;
      emptying with liquid and solid emptying is calculated. Correlation of pancreatic anastomotic&#xD;
      leak with gastric emptying is also done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROTOCOL OF GASTRIC EMRTYING STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liquid study on one day &amp; solid study on the next day&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tracer to be use:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Tc99m-DTPA in water 400ml for 70 Kg adult; volume to be adjusted based on patient&#xD;
           weight, is used for liquid emptying study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Tc99m-Pertechnetate labeled with Idly during cooking, 300gm for 70 Kg adult; volume to&#xD;
           be adjusted based on patient weight, is used for solid emptying study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMAGING TECHNIQUE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequential static images are to be obtained with patient in erect position from anterior &amp;&#xD;
      posterior projections of the abdomen Liquids - 1min image for every 15min for 90mins (to be&#xD;
      extended to 120 mins if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Solids - 1min image for every 30min for 4hrs (to be extended if necessary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMAGE PROCESSING:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Region of interest to be generated over stomach region, after verifying with the surgeon&#xD;
      initially for standardization Now Geometric mean of counts calculated from the stomach and&#xD;
      used to generate the time activity curve, percentage emptying at different time intervals and&#xD;
      T1/2 to be calculated.&#xD;
