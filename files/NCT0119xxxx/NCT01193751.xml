      The specified Apgar-Score in combination with the AAP-Score predicts the morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality of asphyxiated newborns.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the first place the Apgar-score helps to evaluate the postnatal adaptation of the newborn&#xD;
      and is used as an index for resuscitative interventions. However, it has been shown in the&#xD;
      past that the score has its limits and may be influenced by several factors such as the&#xD;
      variability of the examiner, drugs, parental age, neurological impairment of the child as&#xD;
      well as premature delivery. Previous studies have proven, however, that the evaluation of the&#xD;
      infant's condition with the conventional Apgar-score is affected due to non-uniform&#xD;
      definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this, an explanation might be that on the one hand the inaccuracy of the score is based&#xD;
      on missing guidelines for the assessment of the score in premature infants. Both, muscle tone&#xD;
      and reflexes of extremely premature infants are physiologically more immature than they are&#xD;
      in term newborns. In conclusion, healthy premature infants often achieve a lower Apgar-score&#xD;
      than their term counterparts. However, this is rather an expression of their immaturity than&#xD;
      a sign for postnatal depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another reason for the inaccuracy of the score might have its origin in the limited&#xD;
      comparability and validity of the Apgar-score when applied in resuscitated newborns. Until&#xD;
      now there is no consensus how to assess the condition of the newborn under resuscitation,&#xD;
      since the individual characteristics composing the score are affected by the resuscitation&#xD;
      itself. For example, heart frequency and skin colour are improved by sufficient ventilation.&#xD;
      So far there are no regulations on how this fact should be considered while assessing the&#xD;
      score. A description of the infant's condition without interventions respectively with&#xD;
      interruption of the interventions applied would be in contrast to Apgar's intention to have a&#xD;
      score &quot;which could be determined easily without interfering with the care of the infant&quot;. The&#xD;
      description of the condition independently of the interventions applied offers a practicable&#xD;
      alternative. By using this method the resuscitation will not be interrupted and the score&#xD;
      will not express the efforts of the infant but describe its condition, independently of the&#xD;
      requirements needed to achieve this condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the accuracy of the specified version of the Apgar-score to predict neonatal&#xD;
      mortality and long term outcome in preterm infants, the multicenter TEST-Apgar study has been&#xD;
      performed recently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) is also aware of the problem concerning the&#xD;
      description of resuscitated newborns. As a solution, it was suggested to use an expanded&#xD;
      Apgar-score reporting form that accounts for concurrent resuscitative interventions&#xD;
      (AAP-Score). This way the infant's condition can be estimated and documented more easily.&#xD;
      Although the AAP-Score has been suggested 4 years ago, data on the predictive reliability are&#xD;
      not available yet. This aspect regarding the neonatal mortality of premature infants has also&#xD;
      been analyzed in the TEST-Apgar study. The results show that the specified Apgar-Score should&#xD;
      be used in combination with the AAP-Score in the future to appraise the condition of&#xD;
      premature infants. Its predictive value regarding the neonatal mortality of premature infants&#xD;
      is very good. Detailed results will be published soon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study analyzes the validity of the specified Apgar- and the AAP- Scores in&#xD;
      asphyxiated infants &gt;37 weeks of gestation undergoing resuscitation. Since the Apgar-score&#xD;
      presents an index for the postnatal adaption to the extra-uterine life, reflects the&#xD;
      efficiency of resuscitative interventions and also serves as an inclusion criteria for&#xD;
      specific types of therapy (e.g. hypothermia therapy), it is necessary, to standardise the use&#xD;
      of the Apgar-score and improve its prognostic value.&#xD;
