  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of antiviral therapy of patients with chronic hepatitis C (CHC) is the&#xD;
      sustained elimination of the hepatitis C virus (HCV). The standard of care (SOC) is&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2a/-2b with ribavirin for 48 weeks or 24 weeks according to HCV genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this approach is not sufficient to substantially improve the sustained virologic&#xD;
      response (SVR) rates. Therefore, new therapies are needed to treat patients with hepatitis C&#xD;
      virus (HCV) infection. Nitazoxanide (NTZ), originally used to treat cryptosporidium parvum&#xD;
      infection, recently was shown to have an unexpected antiviral activity in the HCV replicon&#xD;
      system and in chronically infected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this work is to study impact of nitazoxanide therapy in addition to&#xD;
      peginterferon/ribavirin combination on virologic responses in patients with chronic hepatitis&#xD;
      C genotype 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled in this study and will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio into 2&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group A: comprises 100 CHC patients who will receive the standard of care treatment,&#xD;
      peginterferon-alf 2a plus weight-based ribavirin for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B: comprises 100 CHC patients who will receive nitazoxanide monotherapy at a dose of&#xD;
      500 mg twice daily for 12 weeks as a lead-in phase followed by triple therapy, nitazoxanide&#xD;
      500 mg twice daily plus peginterferon alfa-2a, and weight-based ribavirin for 48 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected and statistical analysis will be done comparing the groups regarding&#xD;
      response to antiviral therapy. Final results will be discussed and compared to similar&#xD;
      studies published in peer reviewed journals and international conferences.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic hepatitis C virus (CHC) infects approximately 170 million individuals worldwide.&#xD;
      Egypt has the highest hepatitis C virus prevalence in the world (overall prevalence is 12%&#xD;
      among the general population, and up to 40% in persons above 40 years of age and is more in&#xD;
      rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately, 90% of hepatitis C patients in Egypt are infected with HCV genotype 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of antiviral therapy of patients with chronic hepatitis C is the sustained&#xD;
      elimination of the hepatitis C virus (HCV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C is a 24- to 48- week course of&#xD;
      peginterferon plus ribavirin, depending on genotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall, approximately, half of the patients can be cured by SOC. For patients with genotype&#xD;
      4, the sustained virologic response (SVR) rate with 48 weeks of therapy ranges from 50 to 60&#xD;
      %. Based on baseline viral load and the speed of virologic response during treatment,&#xD;
      individualization of treatment duration is possible. However, this approach is not sufficient&#xD;
      to substantially improve the sustained virologic response (SVR) rates. A significant&#xD;
      proportion of treated patients thus either fail to respond or relapse following an initial&#xD;
      response and a substantial number of patients are unable to tolerate treatment. There is at&#xD;
      present no alternative therapy for these patients and thus a need for new drugs for the&#xD;
      treatment of chronic hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitazoxanide, the first member of the thiazolidide anti-infective class of compounds, is an&#xD;
      oral anti-parasitic agent with no major side effects that was developed and licensed in the&#xD;
      US (Alinia; Romark Laboratories, L.C., Tampa FL, USA) for the treatment of cryptosporidium&#xD;
      parvum and Giardia lamblia, recently was shown to have an unexpected antiviral activity in&#xD;
      the HCV replicon system and in chronically infected patients. A serendipitous observation&#xD;
      during drug development revealed that some patients with cryptosporidiosis and acquired&#xD;
      immunodeficiency syndrome who are co-infected with hepatitis C or B viruses, had a reduction&#xD;
      in serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) levels during therapy. This observation led to&#xD;
      studies of the anti-viral activity of nitazoxanide and its active metabolite tizoxanide in&#xD;
      HCV genotype 1a and 1b replicons and a genotype 2 infectious clone, which showed a potent&#xD;
      inhibition of HCV replication by both compounds at submicromolar concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, pretreatment of HCV replicon-containing cells with nitazoxanide was shown to&#xD;
      enhance the antiviral effect of subsequent treatment with nitazoxanide plus interferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanism of action of nitazoxanide in protozoa and anaerobic bacteria has been shown to&#xD;
      result from direct inhibition of pyruvate ferredoxin oxidoreductase enzyme-dependent electron&#xD;
      transfer reaction which is essential to anaerobic energy metabolism. However, the antiviral&#xD;
      mechanism of action of nitazoxanide appears to be different.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies of the mechanism of action of nitazoxanide against HCV have shown that it&#xD;
      induces double-stranded RNA-activated protein kinase (PKR) phosphorylation, which results in&#xD;
      an increased intracellular concentration of phosphorylated eukaryotic initiation factor 2α, a&#xD;
      naturally occurring antiviral intracellular protein and a key mediator of host cell defenses&#xD;
      against viral infection, this mechanism of action is triggered only when a cell is infected&#xD;
      with HCV, whereas nitazoxanide has no effect on in uninfected cells, which provides a&#xD;
      potential explanation for its very low rate of toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It worth mentioning that resistance to nitazoxanide is unlikely as it exerts its antiviral&#xD;
      activity by modulating cell signaling, an interferon-like mechanism, rather than by targeting&#xD;
      the virus directly and that nitazoxanide does not induce mutations that confer viral&#xD;
      resistance, suggesting that the genetic barrier to the development of resistance to&#xD;
      nitazoxanide is high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These clinical and laboratory observations prompted study of the potential effect of&#xD;
      nitazoxanide in patients with chronic hepatitis C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rossingol JF et al,demonstrated that treatment with nitazoxanide monotherapy at a dose of 500&#xD;
      mg twice daily orally, was associated with an ETR in 7 of 23 (30.4%) patients with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C genotype 4, the virologic responses occurred between 4 and 20 weeks of therapy&#xD;
      (three at week 4, three at week 8 and one at week 20) and continued through the end of&#xD;
      treatment with no virological breakthroughs. A low serum HCV RNA ≤ 400,000 IU/ml, was the&#xD;
      most significant predictor of virological response (p=0.009). In addition, none of the&#xD;
      patients with cirrhosis, poorly controlled diabetes, or the one patient with HBV coinfection&#xD;
      responded to treatment. Four of the 7 patients with an ETR (17.4% of 23 treated patients) had&#xD;
      an SVR, 24 weeks after the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This preliminary data prompted the study of the efficacy and safety of Nitazoxanide as a&#xD;
      triple therapy in combination with peginterferon and ribavirin in patients with chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis C genotype 4 aiming at improving the rate of sustained virological response (SVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study by Rossignol JF et al, conducted on a total 97 treatment -naïve patients&#xD;
      conducted in 2 centers in Egypt demonstrated that, significantly more patients receiving&#xD;
      triple therapy with peginterferon alfa-2a, ribavirin and nitazoxanide experienced SVR&#xD;
      compared with the standard of care (79% vs 50%; p=0-023). The SVR rates for the peginterferon&#xD;
      plus nitazoxanide group was higher than the standard of care (61% vs 50%) although this&#xD;
      difference was not statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentages of rapid virologic response (RVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA at week 4&#xD;
      of combination therapy, and SVR were significantly higher in patients given the triple&#xD;
      (Nitazoxanide/ peginterferon/ ribavirin) therapy compared with the standard of care (64% vs&#xD;
      38%, P = .048; and 79% vs 50%, P = .023; respectively). Patients given nitazoxanide plus&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2a had intermediate rates of RVR (54%). There were no added side effects&#xD;
      associated with the use of nitazoxanide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean reductions in serum HCV RNA from baseline to the RVR visit were -2.86, -3.74, and -4.5&#xD;
      log10 IU/ml for the peginterferon plus ribavirin, dual therapy with peginterferon plus&#xD;
      nitazoxanide, and triple therapy with peginterferon, ribavirin and nitazoxanide groups,&#xD;
      respectively (p=0.008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes in ALT levels from baseline to week 72 in patients who achieved an SVR were&#xD;
      evaluated, nearly all patients had normalization of ALT levels (15/16 patients in groups 1&#xD;
      and 3, and all patients in group 2), in parallel with loss of detectable serum HCV RNA.&#xD;
      Interestingly, the use of nitazoxanide in the dual- and triple-treatment arms was associated&#xD;
      with reduced relapse rates (3/20 patients and 1/23 patients, respectively) compared with the&#xD;
      standard of care arm (10/30 patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for a nitazoxanide lead-in phase before combined therapy with peginterferon,&#xD;
      with or without ribavirin, was based on an initial pilot experience that showed greater&#xD;
      antiviral efficacy if nitazoxanide was administered before peginterferon rather than&#xD;
      simultaneously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The required duration of nitazoxanide lead-in phase is unknown, and 12 weeks was selected as&#xD;
      an initial conservative estimate to optimize the potential benefit of nitazoxanide&#xD;
      pretreatment. A subsequent study has shown that a 4-week lead-in phase may be satisfactory,&#xD;
      and this study also provides further confirmation of the antiviral efficacy of nitazoxanide&#xD;
      combined with peginterferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this open-labeled study, 44 treatment-naïve patients with chronic hepatitis C were treated&#xD;
      with 4 weeks on nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily followed by combination dual therapy of&#xD;
      peginterferon alfa-2a 180 µg weekly plus nitazoxanide 500 mg twice daily for an additional 36&#xD;
      weeks. Interestingly, the SVR rate with dual therapy (80%), was similar to the SVR rate with&#xD;
      triple therapy (79%) seen in the previous study using a 12-week lead-in phase. This shorter&#xD;
      lead-in period might be adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a preliminary experience with interferon nonresponders, a small number of patients with&#xD;
      chronic hepatitis C genotype 4 who had failed prior interferon-based therapy were re-treated&#xD;
      using triple therapy with nitazoxanide, peginterferon and ribavirin and achieved an SVR rate&#xD;
      of 25% (3/12 patients) compared with 8% (1/12 patients) retreated with the standard of care&#xD;
      using peginterferon alfa-2a plus ribavirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All these data show that nitazoxanide, a novel protein kinase inducer, has the potential to&#xD;
      increase the SVR rate in patients with chronic hepatitis C, however, further studies to test&#xD;
      these hypotheses on larger numbers of both naïve and nonresponder patients are still&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
