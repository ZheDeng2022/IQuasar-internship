    <textblock>
      This protocol is a single-arm, three-cohort, phase II multicenter study designed to assess&#xD;
      the safety and the efficacy of three all-oral combinations: Velcade with continuous low-dose&#xD;
      melphalan and prednisone (VMP) or with continuous low-dose cyclophosphamide and prednisone&#xD;
      (VCP) or Velcade with low-dose prednisone could be effective and well tolerated (VP).&#xD;

      This protocol is a single-arm, three-cohort, phase II multicenter study designed to assess&#xD;
      the safety and the efficacy of VMP and VCP and VP as up-front treatment in elderly MM&#xD;
      patients. The combination of weekly subcutaneous administrations of Velcade with continuous&#xD;
      low-dose melphalan and prednisone (VMP) or with continuous low-dose cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      prednisone (VCP) or Velcade with low-dose prednisone could be effective and well tolerated&#xD;
      (VP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated at scheduled visits in up to 3 study periods: pre-treatment,&#xD;
      treatment and long-term follow-up (LTFU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-treatment period includes screening visits, performed at study entry. After providing&#xD;
      written informed consent to participate in the study, patients will be evaluated for study&#xD;
      eligibility. The screening period includes the availability of inclusion criteria described&#xD;
      above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment period includes induction and maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects receive:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Induction therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           nine 4-week courses of Velcade/Melphalan/Prednisone (VMP) or nine 4-week courses of&#xD;
           Velcade/Cyclophosphamide/Prednisone (VCP) or Nine 4-week courses of Velcade/Prednisone&#xD;
           (VP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Maintenance therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Velcade alone During the induction period patients will attend periodic study centre visits&#xD;
      each scheduled Velcade administration in order to asses the toxicity and efficacy of the&#xD;
      treatment. During the maintenance period, all patients will attend study centre visits every&#xD;
      4 weeks, until development of confirmed PD. The response will be assessed after each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the LTFU period, after development of confirmed PD, all patients are to be followed&#xD;
      for survival during the LTFU period every 3 months via telephone or office visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of treatment period, including the maintenance treatment is approximately 3&#xD;
      years. The duration of LTFU is approximately 2 years, for a total of 5 years. the occurance&#xD;
      of PD will determine the duration of progression-free survival of each patient(secondary&#xD;
      objective). The occurrence of death will determine the duration of overall survival&#xD;
      (secondary objective).&#xD;
