  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and tolerability of four new&#xD;
      investigational Cytomegalovirus (CMV) vaccines (Towne-Toledo 1, 2, 3, 4) in healthy male&#xD;
      volunteers who are CMV negative. CMV is a common virus, infecting 50-80% of adults in the&#xD;
      United States by the age of twenty-one. CMV does not usually cause illness in adults or&#xD;
      children. However, CMV can be a cause of deafness and mental retardation in a child if a&#xD;
      mother is infected during pregnancy. It also can be a serious illness in patients with&#xD;
      impaired immunity (decreased ability to fight infection).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of thirty six participants will be enrolled. The first 12 participants will be&#xD;
      randomized into four groups. Four groups will receive one of the four investigational&#xD;
      vaccines. The four investigational HCMV vaccine candidates will be administered&#xD;
      subcutaneously to 3 volunteers at 10 pfu (the lowest dose to be used). The safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of the four investigational HCMV vaccine candidates will be monitored closely&#xD;
      for a period of 12 weeks following vaccination at this dose. Investigational vaccines that&#xD;
      are found to be safe and well tolerated at a dose of 10pfu will be administered to 3&#xD;
      additional individuals at 102 pfu and then at 103 pfu. Safety and tolerability will be&#xD;
      evaluated at each dose level by monitoring clinical signs and symptoms, laboratory parameters&#xD;
      and virus detection in the blood, urine, and saliva. After the 12-week safety-monitoring&#xD;
      period, participants will be followed for the remainder of one year to assess long-term&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of the investigational vaccines.&#xD;
