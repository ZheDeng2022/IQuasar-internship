    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is widely prevalent in India. Serum 25(OH)D levels are &lt;20 ng /ml in up&#xD;
      to 90% of them. Recently, in a randomized control trial, investigators have shown that dual&#xD;
      cholecalciferol and calcium supplementation lead to significant improvement in hand grip&#xD;
      strength and distance covered during six minutes walk test. Present study is being taken to&#xD;
      further understand the functional significance of 25(OH)D in terms of its effect on Skeletal&#xD;
      muscle strength including surface electromyography (EMG) in a larger cohort involving&#xD;
      approximately 200 subjects. The impact of calcium and vitamin D supplementation would be&#xD;
      assessed by supplementing them alone and in combination. Besides, the investigators would&#xD;
      also assess impact of above supplementation on Th1/Th2 cytokines expression in the peripheral&#xD;
      mononuclear cells.&#xD;

      Vitamin D is an essential nutrient that plays an important role in calcium metabolism and&#xD;
      bone health. In recent years, biomarkers like PTH, calcium absorption have been used to&#xD;
      define relevant biological indices of vitamin D nutritional status. Several studies from&#xD;
      India have shown wide prevalence of vitamin D deficiency (VDD) in India. Goswami et al&#xD;
      studied serum 25 (OH)D levels and its functional significance in apparently healthy subjects&#xD;
      residing in Delhi and showed low serum 25(OH)D values in all the groups (Am J Clin Nutr&#xD;
      2000). Its functional significance is currently under evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevant studies assessing functional significance of VDD in Asian Indians are summarized&#xD;
      below (Am J Clin Nutr 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Goswami et al while reporting low serum 25(OH) D concentrations in healthy subjects in&#xD;
      Delhi, showed a higher serum PTH levels &amp; significant inverse relation between serum 25(OH) D&#xD;
      and PTH levels ( r = -0.6303, p &lt; 0.001) in all the three groups (soldiers, physicians &amp;&#xD;
      nurses, depigmented persons) studied in winter (Am J Clin Nutr 2006) B) Effects on BMD&#xD;
      Recently,we have analyzed relationship between BMD and serum 25(OH) D in 105 apparently&#xD;
      healthy Asian Indian. The cohort of 105 subjects was split into 2 groups at a serum 25(OH) D&#xD;
      cutoff of 9.0 ng/mL. The mean serum iPTH was significantly higher in the group 1 (&lt;9.0&#xD;
      ng/ml)than in the group 2 subjects (53.1±31.3 and 39.3±17.5 pg/mL, respectively; P=0.012).The&#xD;
      mean BMD values of the total hip, including femoral neck, trochanter, and intertrochanter,&#xD;
      were significantly (P = 0.001) lower in group 1 than in group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Effect of VDD on intestinal calcium absorption in Asian Indians with chronic&#xD;
      hypovitaminosis D and its change after cholecalciferol supplementation was studied recently&#xD;
      at our Department of Endocrinology and Metabolism. Study subjects were 29 apparently healthy&#xD;
      volunteers [17 M, 12 F, mean (SD) age = 28.4 ± 6.4 year] with low serum 25(OH)D levels [mean&#xD;
      (SD) = 7.6 ± 4.8 ng/ml]. Intestinal calcium absorption was assessed by 'calcium load test'&#xD;
      (PAK test) (10) using 1 gm of oral elemental calcium load before and after (n = 26)&#xD;
      supplementation with oral cholecalciferol (60,000 IU/week for eight weeks). This study showed&#xD;
      that the vitamin D Deficiency is physiologically relevant in terms of intestinal calcium&#xD;
      absorption in Asian Indians (Journal of Human Nutrition and dietetics 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently in a randomized control trial we have shown significant improvement in the muscle&#xD;
      strength and walking distance after dual supplementation with cholecalciferol and calcium&#xD;
      (Clin Endocrinol 2010). In the current study we plan to study this aspect further by&#xD;
      recruiting four groups to study the effect of calcium and vitamin D supplementation alone or&#xD;
      in combination as a dual supplementation. Baseline evaluation (Before vitamin D&#xD;
      supplementation) would include serum total calcium, inorganic phosphorus, alkaline&#xD;
      phosphatase, intact PTH and 25(OH) D assays, hand grip muscle strength and surface EMG&#xD;
      testing. Hand grip would be done will be done using a computerized dynamometer in the&#xD;
      Department of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation under the guidance of Professor U Singh,&#xD;
      Head, Department of Physical Medicine &amp; Rehabilitation, AIIMS. Handgrip strength will be&#xD;
      measured in right hand by dynamometer. The average of two measurement of grip strength will&#xD;
      be used for analysis (in kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical performance will be tested by performing 6 - minute walk test using standard&#xD;
      protocol and results will be interpreted in terms of 6 minute walk distance in meters and&#xD;
      degree of shortness of breath using modified Borg dyspnea scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mRNA expression Th1 and Th2 cytokines would be assessed in the PBMC drawn from 5 ml of&#xD;
      the peripheral blood using the real time PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin D supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the subjects will be randomized into three treatment groups and one placebo group in a&#xD;
      double blind manner. Random code would be generated by a investigator, who will not be&#xD;
      involved in distribution of medicines and assessment of the muscle strength Active drug would&#xD;
      be calcium (two tablets of calcium carbonate each containing 500 mg of elemental calcium/day,&#xD;
      and 60,000 IU of cholecalciferol/week obtained from the commercial source. The inactive drug&#xD;
      would be lactose containing identical placebo obtained from the same source. All study&#xD;
      subjects will be provided with packets containing four sachets of cholecalciferol (each&#xD;
      containing 60000 IU vitamin D3; Cadila Pharmaceutical, India) /placebo; and sixty tablets of&#xD;
      calcium carbonate (500mg elemental calcium &amp; 250 IU vitamin D3; Elder Pharmaceutical,&#xD;
      India)/placebo. First dose will be supervised. Subjects will be counseled for daily intake of&#xD;
      two tablets of calcium carbonate and weekly intake of a cholecalciferol sachet and follow up&#xD;
      at completion of 4 weeks. Similar packets will be given after 4 weeks of follow up. Drug&#xD;
      compliance will be assessed by counting the empty sachets. After eight week subjects will be&#xD;
      provided daily two tablets of calcium carbonate containing 500 mg elemental calcium each and&#xD;
      two sachets of cholecalciferol every month for four months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment at 8 weeks and 6 months would include serum intact PTH &amp; 25(OH) D levels&#xD;
      estimation, skeletal muscle strength testing, and 6 minute walk test and Th1/Th2 analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety of Proposed Interventions Cholecalciferol dose of 60000 IU/week × 8 weeks has been&#xD;
      considered safe to be used in healthy subjects, as shown in our recent studies.&#xD;
