  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human cancers express tumor antigens that can be targeted by cytolytic T lymphocytes (CTL).&#xD;
      These antigens consist of a small peptide, derived from endogenous proteins, that is&#xD;
      presented at the cancer cell's surface by an HLA class I molecule. Such antigenic peptides,&#xD;
      including MAGE-3.A1 and NA17.A2, have been tested in experimental therapeutic vaccines to&#xD;
      elicit CTL responses in cancer patients, mainly with metastatic melanoma. Up to now, only&#xD;
      rare tumor responses have been observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor resistance to CTL killing is the most likely explanation for the poor effectiveness of&#xD;
      cancer vaccines. This resistance is probably acquired by the tumor during its development and&#xD;
      selected by its repetitive challenge with spontaneous anti-tumoral immune responses. The&#xD;
      precise molecular mechanisms of tumor resistance remain unknown. The observation that&#xD;
      tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TIL) purified from melanoma metastases can recognize and kill&#xD;
      autologous tumor cells in vitro, whilst they seem unable to control tumor growth in vivo,&#xD;
      suggests that this resistance is hosted by the tumor environment, rather than being the&#xD;
      result of a generalized immune suppression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a murine model of cutaneous graft rejection that mimics the&#xD;
      situation in melanoma. Female CBA mice do not reject syngeneic male skin grafts, even though&#xD;
      they mount a spontaneous CTL response against H-Y, a male specific minor histocompatibility&#xD;
      antigen, following grafting. The investigators have tested various experimental procedures&#xD;
      aimed at inducing effective graft rejection in these mice. This was obtained with a&#xD;
      combination of IFN-α, IL-2, GM-CSF, each administered separately under the skin graft,&#xD;
      associated with topical applications of imiquimod. All these agents are available as&#xD;
      registered drugs. Based on this murine model of cutaneous allograft rejection, the&#xD;
      investigators postulate that local immunomodulation with this combination can trigger an&#xD;
      effective tumor rejection process, and induce a more efficient and long-lasting anti-tumoral&#xD;
      immune response following peptide vaccination.&#xD;

      Patients will receive the following treatments:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Vaccinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The vaccine will be the MAGE-3.A1 and/or the NA17.A2 peptide, matching the patient's HLA&#xD;
           type and the gene expression of his tumor. If both antigens are expressed, then the&#xD;
           patient will receive both peptides.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Local treatment with a combination of immunomodulatory drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This treatment will combine peritumoral injection of IL-2, IFN-α and GM-CSF (6000 IU, 100.000&#xD;
      IU and 300 ng per tumor injected, respectively), as well as topical application of imiquimod&#xD;
      (applied during 24h). The peritumoral injections of cytokines will be given on days&#xD;
      +2,+3,+4,+7,+8 and +9, and the Aldara® cream will be applied on days +2 and +7 following&#xD;
      vaccines 3 and 4. One or 2 cutaneous lesions will be treated, if there are 2 or more such&#xD;
      lesions present at day 29 of the treatment, respectively.&#xD;
