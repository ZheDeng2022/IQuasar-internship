      The objectives of this Phase I study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      endoscopic endodontic equipment device for root canal assistance treatment as well as to&#xD;
      evaluate the ease of use of this device, by a surgeon experienced in endodontic treatment, in&#xD;
      a true clinical setting.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This open, phase 1 trial will be conducted on 15 patients with the need for root canal&#xD;
      treatment. The teeth will be permanent teeth in which the need for root canal treatment was&#xD;
      decided by his dentist in the dental clinic in the Barzilai medical center Ashkelon.&#xD;
      Videoendoscopy of the procedure will be recorded and will include a post-op view of the&#xD;
      treatment. Patients will be followed up for pain infection and any potential complications;&#xD;
      immediately, at 4 weeks 12 weeks and 6 month post- op. The procedure will also be taped&#xD;
      externally to document surgeon's convenience with the equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures will be performed under local or general anesthesia in an ambulatory&#xD;
      environment, using standard root canal equipment, which will include endodontic hand and&#xD;
      rotary files, endodonically used irrigating solutions and the videoendoscopy equipment. Under&#xD;
      this protocol the basic treatment will be carried out by professional well trained&#xD;
      endodontist in the same way used for root canal treatment. Following the mechanical&#xD;
      preparation of the canal the endoscope, connected to a video camera and monitor, is&#xD;
      introduced with the help of isotonic saline irrigation. With the aid of the endoscope remains&#xD;
      of soft tissue from the pulp tissue will be coagulated with the ERBOTOM ICC 80 monopolar&#xD;
      fibers and removed with the irrigation, the canal will be inspected for lateral canals and&#xD;
      the monoplar fibers will be used for coagulating and removal of this tissue. Er-Yag laser&#xD;
      fiber connected to Erbium laser generator will be used for finalizing the canal preparation&#xD;
      and preparation of the lateral canals. Actual lasing and coagulation will be performed only&#xD;
      under clear vision, when the fiber is seen to be in direct contact with the tissue. Adequate&#xD;
      irrigation will be maintained throughout the procedure using an intravenous bag connected to&#xD;
      the irrigation port on the sheath of the endoscope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The endoscope device will be connected to the Erbbe diathermy ERBOTOM ICC 80 for coagulation&#xD;
      monopolar fibers 0.05-0.1 mm number 20197-021-022 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Lumenis Opus 20, dental Erbium:YAG laser available in the hospital. Lasing will&#xD;
      begin at a setting of 300 mj per pulse and a pulse rate of 7 Hz.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same procedures performed on 15 human teeth in a lab status. The insertion of the&#xD;
      instruments to the root canal will be in 2 techniques:1) Via the endoscope channel and 2) The&#xD;
      instruments will be inserted parallel to the endoscope.&#xD;
