  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed series addresses the prevention and treatment of voice problems in teachers.&#xD;
      Data in the literature clearly identify voice disorders as teachers' primary occupational&#xD;
      risk not only in the U.S. but also internationally. Moreover, voice problems constitute a&#xD;
      global women's health concern. Until recently, few reports have been available around the&#xD;
      treatment of these problems in teachers, and even fewer have addressed the equally important&#xD;
      question of prevention. The present studies are conducted within the context of a long-range&#xD;
      goal to identify effective intervention methodologies for both the prevention and treatment&#xD;
      of voice problems in teachers taking into consideration multicultural and linguistic factors.&#xD;
      The present studies will report pragmatic data around the effectiveness of two&#xD;
      theoretically-driven approaches to the prevention and treatment of voice problems in&#xD;
      teachers, (a) voice hygiene education (VH) and (b) voice hygiene education + voice production&#xD;
      training in &quot;resonant voice&quot; (VH+VP, essentially the Lessac-Madsen Resonant Voice Therapy&#xD;
      program). Participants will be student teachers in Pittsburgh and Hong Kong, who will be&#xD;
      followed from student teaching across their second full year of employment as a professional&#xD;
      teacher. The central aims are: [1] to evaluate the effectiveness of VH and VH+VP for the&#xD;
      prevention of future voice problems in student teachers who are vocally healthy at the outset&#xD;
      of the protocol, versus the treatment of voice problems in student teachers who already have&#xD;
      them at some level; [2] to evaluate the generality of the findings across teachers in the&#xD;
      U.S. and China, using appropriate linguistic and cultural adaptations of the interventions;&#xD;
      and [3] to evaluate the feasibility of an internet-based voice exercise and reporting program&#xD;
      as a supplement to face-to-face interventions. Ergonomic and personal factors will also be&#xD;
      evaluated for their differential ability to predict the risk for future voice problems in&#xD;
      teachers. The results should be useful at a practical level, and should also lay the&#xD;
      groundwork for future studies assessing similar issues around the prevention of voice&#xD;
      problems in teachers, in particular as influenced by multicultural factors within the U.S.&#xD;
      The results should also be useful for future studies investigating causal pathways in&#xD;
      interventions around these problems.&#xD;

        By self-report in person or over the phone: (a) 21-40 yr; (b) no current self-perceived&#xD;
        voice problem;(c) student teacher in the final year of formal education prior to the&#xD;
        initiation of employment as a teacher and imminent start of the first formal teaching&#xD;
        practicum; (d) availability and willingness to attend up to an 8-hr group intervention on 1&#xD;
        of 2 days when it will be offered the week before the start of student teaching,&#xD;
        willingness to be randomized to one of three groups, and stated willingness to persist with&#xD;
        the entire 2.5-yr protocol, which will involve baseline, 1-mo, 3-mo, 1-yr,and 2-yr&#xD;
        follow-up measures, and two separate interventions followed by a 4-wk hygiene reporting and&#xD;
        potentially voice exercise period for intervention groups; (e) intention to obtain&#xD;

        other medical conditions or medications that would affect voice, with the exception of&#xD;
        seasonal allergies (and their treatment) or laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR; and its&#xD;
        treatment).&#xD;

        group&quot;-assuming the subject has indicated normal voice by self report, or overall voice&#xD;
        quality score &lt; 20, together with a total VHI score &gt; 25 and either normal larynx or mildly&#xD;

        protocol(D.2.4.1; &quot;high-starter group&quot;)-if the subject has indicated normal voice or at&#xD;
