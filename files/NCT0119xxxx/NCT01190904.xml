  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out if androgen deficiency (low levels of testosterone,&#xD;
      a male hormone produced by the sex glands) and erectile dysfunction (sexual dysfunction) will&#xD;
      predict over time the development of a heart attack, stroke, or death in men with Diabetes&#xD;
      Mellitus who have angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) (≥50%) with or&#xD;
      without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). A substudy aims to show the different&#xD;
      factors and processes that may show a relationship between sexual function and levels of&#xD;
      androgen in the body to heart disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes mellitus (DM) and multi-vessel coronary artery disease (CAD) entail significant risk&#xD;
      for progression of cardiac morbidity and mortality. Compelling recent research points to&#xD;
      biological pathways that link DM and CAD to androgen status and sexual function. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that androgen deficiency (AD) and erectile dysfunction (ED) independently serve&#xD;
      as sentinel indicators, predicting the future development of adverse cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events in men with diabetes following coronary revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ED is emerging as a barometer of overall endothelial function. We hypothesize that as a&#xD;
      consequence of this relationship, erectile dysfunction is predictive of cardiovascular&#xD;
      outcomes in men with diabetes and CAD. We also propose that AD affects morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality in men with DM and CAD by influencing presentation and progression of endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction as well as inflammation and hemostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to investigate four specific aims using 1,143 diabetic men who have&#xD;
      angiographically proven coronary artery disease (CAD) (≥50%) in at least one major epicardial&#xD;
      vessel with or without percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Specific aims of this study&#xD;
      are: 1) To determine whether androgen status at baseline independently predicts primary and&#xD;
      secondary endpoints in men (n=1,143) with DM and CAD. 2) To determine whether erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction at baseline independently predicts cardiovascular outcomes in men with DM and&#xD;
      CAD. 3) To determine whether change of androgen status and sexual function over time&#xD;
      independently predict cardiovascular outcomes in men with DM and CAD. 4) To demonstrate&#xD;
      specific mediators and pathways that link sexual function and androgen status to&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is defined as the combined all-cause mortality, non-fatal myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI), and stroke. Secondary endpoints include major adverse cardiovascular and&#xD;
      cerebrovascular events (MACCE), defined as death, nonfatal MI, stroke or revascularization at&#xD;
      one year and angina status as evaluated with the Seattle Angina Questionnaire (SAQ) at 6&#xD;
      months, 12 months, 18 months, 24 months, 30 months and 36 months following catheterization.&#xD;
