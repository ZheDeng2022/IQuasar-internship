  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. In an initial&#xD;
      phase, 100 patients with chronic low back pain will be included in this study. The patients&#xD;
      will be recruited through magazines and newspapers to take part in a screening for treatment&#xD;
      of low back pain. This screening will involve the evaluation of data such as history and&#xD;
      physical examination to classify the patient in the group of nonspecific low back pain,&#xD;
      excluding patients with neurological alterations and the so-called Red-Flags.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures After the initial screening the patients will undergo diagnostic blocks of the&#xD;
      medial branch of lumbar vertebrae L2, L3, L4 , L5 and of the first sacral vertebra (S1) with&#xD;
      lidocaine and control with distilled water. The patients that present more than 50% of pain&#xD;
      improvement, evaluated by the Likert scale after 30 minutes will form the study group, while&#xD;
      the patients that do not present pain improvement with lidocaine or that present pain&#xD;
      improvement with distilled water will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medial branch block consists of the insertion of a 90mm, 25-gauge needle through the skin&#xD;
      with radioscopic control up to the medial branch topography. Infusion of 1ml of 2% lidocaine&#xD;
      should be performed in each medial branch of the abovementioned vertebrae. Control is&#xD;
      executed in the same manner yet with infusion of 1ml of distilled water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through the use of the diagnostic block we will have 40 patients selected for the second&#xD;
      phase of the study. Once defined the study group should be evaluated before the procedure&#xD;
      through the Oswestry, Roland Morris, SF-36 and VAS questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase of the study the patients will be randomized. The random division into&#xD;
      two groups will be performed through a computerized program of random numbers. The&#xD;
      randomization result will be kept in matt sealed envelopes to guarantee secrecy of the&#xD;
      allocation. The neurolysis procedure will be carried out in the first group, consisting of 20&#xD;
      patients, and the placebo or sham procedure with the second group, also with 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurolysis procedure will be carried out under sterile conditions, with the patient lying&#xD;
      prone and with the neurotome insertion sites anesthetized with 2ml of 1% lidocaine. The&#xD;
      neurotome (Smith &amp; Nephew - RF) will be used for the procedure. The neurotome is a&#xD;
      radiofrequency apparatus mounted on a 10cm electrode type 22 needle with a 5mm exposure tip.&#xD;
      The neurotome should be introduced percutaneously in a manner similar to that adopted in the&#xD;
      medial branch block through radioscopic control. The temperature of the electrode after its&#xD;
      placement in the correct position is then raised to 80 Â°C for 90 seconds. Two neurotomies&#xD;
      should be performed for each facet, one proximally and the other distally, due to double&#xD;
      innervation of each facet. In the patients of the placebo group the procedure will be the&#xD;
      same only the temperature of the neurotome will not be raised. This will be performed in a&#xD;
      blind manner, as before starting the procedure, the surgeon will show the assistant who turns&#xD;
      the device on or not the envelope containing the patient's group (placebo or neurotomy), yet&#xD;
      the surgeon will not be informed whether the device has been turned on or not, having to&#xD;
      perform the procedure in the same manner in both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will then be reevaluated in the first month, 3 months after, 6 months after and&#xD;
      12 months after the procedure. The assessors will not be informed of the group to which the&#xD;
      patient belongs, and the same scales performed in the preoperative period will be used here.&#xD;
