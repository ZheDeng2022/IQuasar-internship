    <textblock>
      This non-interventional study for prospective follow up of a cohort of 220 subjects born&#xD;
      small for gestational age (SGA) is planned for the purpose of finding out if normalisation of&#xD;
      adult height is associated or not with metabolic alterations and if true, their magnitude and&#xD;
      relevance as well as to detect warnings throughout the treatment period that may be useful&#xD;
      for prevention or therapy. This study would help in answering the question if the SGA and&#xD;
      growth hormone (GH) association results in insulin resistance and if affirmative, who&#xD;
      develops it as well as its impact on other metabolic parameters that precedes type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The small for gestational age (SGA) concept includes babies born to term whose weight and/or&#xD;
      height is lower than two standard deviations (SD) below the mean. Pathologically short&#xD;
      stature is understood as a stature of 2.5 SD below the mean for their age and an expected&#xD;
      adult height adjusted to the parental height of one SD below the mean. These SGA children&#xD;
      with a pathological short stature after four years of age are unsuitable for GH treatment. In&#xD;
      fact, there is no other efficient treatment for short stature and insufficient development of&#xD;
      these children other than GH. In addition to short stature, the SGA syndrome also includes&#xD;
      resistance to insulin with the consequent risk of developing type 2 diabetes and other&#xD;
      interrelated metabolic alterations like dyslipidemia and hypertension; and the&#xD;
      glucose-insulin-insulin growth factors (IGFs)-proteins transport axis regulate growth as well&#xD;
      as foetal metabolism and development. Independent from the possible maternal environmental&#xD;
      causes, those born with SGA have low levels of somatomedin C (IGF-I) and its transport&#xD;
      protein [Insulin-like growth factor binding protein 3 (IGFBP-3)] as well as fasting&#xD;
      hyperinsulinemia. The low levels of IGF-1 and IGFBP-3 persist in those that do not present a&#xD;
      catch-up growth and the insulin resistance is secondary to the somatotrope axis. Treatment&#xD;
      with GH increases IGF-I and IGFBP3 levels but also the plasmatic level of fasting insulin and&#xD;
      the long term net result of this combination is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis has shown, that although during the first 2 years of GH treatment, there are no&#xD;
      signs of glucose intolerance even though there is less sensitivity to insulin, there could be&#xD;
      a greater incidence of type 2 diabetes in deficient children that have been treated with GH&#xD;
      for a longer period. Treatment with GH, of children born SGA that have not caught-up their&#xD;
      growth at 4 years of age, in the majority of cases achieves a good initial growth speed&#xD;
      increase in order to continue to grow within normal limits and end up with an adult height&#xD;
      that falls within normal. This is achieved with an authorised daily dose of 0.035 mg/kg (1&#xD;
      mg/m2/day). However, the question regarding the possible metabolic consequences of GH&#xD;
      treatment of those born SGA remains unanswered in both forms, to find out if GH treatment&#xD;
      increases or reduces resistance to insulin and other associated metabolic parameters and&#xD;
      therefore, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Continued monitoring to adult height of a&#xD;
      cohort of subjects born with SGA and treated with GH is the most efficient, easy and&#xD;
      comfortable tool for answering that question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To quantify the evolution of insulin sensitivity from the start of treatment with GH&#xD;
           until adult stature is reached. Sensitivity or resistance to insulin is calculated using&#xD;
           the HOMA-IR model (Homeostasis Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance) which is a&#xD;
           reliable and easy mathematical model that uses the following formula: insulinemia&#xD;
           (Î¼U/ml) x glycemia (mmol/l)/22.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To find predictive factors for the possible changes in insulin sensitivity and its&#xD;
           complex associated obesity, hypertension and high triglycerides type dyslipidemia with&#xD;
           low high density lipoprotein (HDL)-cholesterol. For this, a relation between these&#xD;
           metabolic factors and auxological parameters is to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The following are considered independent or predictive variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Speed of growth in cm/ year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard deviations of height&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IGF-I in ng/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IGFBP-3 in ng/ml b. The dependent variables will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HOMA-IR value&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triglycerides rate in mg/dl / HDL-cholesterol in mg/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood pressure in mmHG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body mass index&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study of a single cohort, without the possibility of a control group&#xD;
      because those born with SGA, who experience a catch-up growth and enter normal auxology&#xD;
      within the first four years of life are not subjected to a paediatric follow-up similar to&#xD;
      those that do not catch-up to normal auxology and are treated with GH. Therefore, the same&#xD;
      auxological and metabolic test results are not available in standard care. The collection of&#xD;
      said parameters requires an &quot;ad hoc&quot; intervention and the study would be experimental or&#xD;
      interventional. The observation period of this study encompasses from the start of treatment&#xD;
      with GH up to a year after finishing the treatment for any reason. The starting age as well&#xD;
      as the time treatment is ended will vary per subject. However, most subjects finish treatment&#xD;
      once adulthood is reached. In accordance with clinical studies, the average observation&#xD;
      period will probably be about 10 years. After the basal data is made available, the&#xD;
      collection of data afterwards will be carried out once a year per subject.&#xD;
