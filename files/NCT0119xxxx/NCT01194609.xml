      Among the immune cell therapy, autologous adoptive immune cell therapy is a method to&#xD;
      transfer the immune cells derived from peripheral white blood cells and expanded and&#xD;
      stimulated with various cytokines and tumor specific antigens in cancer patients. Recently,&#xD;
      the low-dose radiation is known to increase the immune response in many human cancer&#xD;
      patients. In a clinical trial, 70% response rate with combination of low-dose radiation and&#xD;
      adoptive immune cell therapy was reported in recurrent melanoma patients. This study is to&#xD;
      investigate the feasibility of combination of low-dose radiation and autologous immune cell&#xD;
      therapy in recurrent cervical cancer which is resistant to conventional palliative treatment.&#xD;

      Immune cell therapy is considered one of the most promising anti-cancer strategy in many&#xD;
      human cancers. Compared to the destructive methods such as surgery, radiation, and&#xD;
      chemotherapy, anti-cancer immune therapy is safer and less toxic method in the treatment of&#xD;
      human cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the immune cell therapy, autologous adoptive immune cell therapy is a method to&#xD;
      transfer the immune cells derived from peripheral white blood cells and expanded and&#xD;
      stimulated with various cytokines and tumor specific antigens in cancer patients. Recent&#xD;
      development of the technique to expand immune cells ex vivo make autologous adoptive immune&#xD;
      cell therapy much more feasible and popular. However, immune cell therapy showed response of&#xD;
      below 10% currently in several clinical trials. The reason of poor response is that the&#xD;
      adopted immune cells have to overcome the highly immune compromised environment in advanced&#xD;
      or recurrent cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The low-dose radiation, defined as the radiation below the therapeutic dose range, is known&#xD;
      to increase the immune response in many human cancer patients. Despite the exact mechanism is&#xD;
      not well known, the 'danger signal' and the decrease of T-regulatory cells by low-dose&#xD;
      radiation are the possible mechanism of enhanced immunity by low-dose radiation. So, the&#xD;
      combination of low-dose radiation and immune cell therapy can be a attractive strategy to&#xD;
      recurrent or advanced cancer patients who are resistant to conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A challenging clinical trial performed in recurrent melanoma cancers, Dr. Rosenverg reported&#xD;
      around 70% response rate with combination of low-dose radiation and adoptive immune cell&#xD;
      therapy. However, the feasibility of combination of low-dose radiation and immune cell&#xD;
      therapy is still unknown in many human cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to investigate the feasibility of combination of low-dose radiation and&#xD;
      autologous immune cell therapy in recurrent cervical cancer which is resistant to&#xD;
      conventional palliative treatment. The cervical cancer, highly responsive to radiation,&#xD;
      becomes resistant to radiation in case of recurrent disease. We hypothetize that if the&#xD;
      low-dose radiation can reverse the immune compromised environment, adoptive immune cells&#xD;
      derived from the autologous peripheral blood immune cells will be highly effective in&#xD;
      recurrent cervical cancers.&#xD;
