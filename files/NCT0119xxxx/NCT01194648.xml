      RATIONALE: Prospective trials using hemi-ablation with high intensity focused ultrasound&#xD;
      (HIFU) (Sonablate 500) have demonstrated feasibility, safety, and encouraging functional&#xD;
      outcomes and early cancer control with 90% of men achieving trifecta status (no erectile&#xD;
      dysfunction, leak-free pad-free continence, cancer control). However, these trials have&#xD;
      involved small numbers of patients with men selected for good baseline function. A&#xD;
      multi-centre prospective trial within a larger cohort of men that better represents the&#xD;
      patient population with prostate cancer (external validity) is required.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Verification of a new therapy as favourable, or equivalent, in outcome to 'standard' care is&#xD;
      ideally sought through comparison with another matched control group. Randomised controlled&#xD;
      trials (RCTs) offer the best method for minimising systematic bias and revealing the true&#xD;
      effect of an intervention or drug. However, RCTs involving treatments of localised prostate&#xD;
      cancer have had a historically poor patient uptake, as the reference 'gold' standard of care&#xD;
      is not known. In addition, RCTs are expensive to run and involve huge infra-structural&#xD;
      support. A number of trials in the USA have been forced to close due to lack of recruitment.&#xD;
      The ProStart trial in the UK has also had to close for the same reason. It has been&#xD;
      acknowledged by the Food and Drug Agency in the USA that comparative randomized trials will&#xD;
      be problematic in this area due to lack of physician and patient equipoise. A randomized&#xD;
      trial may be feasible if a pragmatic design is adopted but prior to acceptance of such a&#xD;
      design, the number of centres with expertise in this complex intervention (mp-MRI, TTPM,&#xD;
      focal HIFU) will need to be increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational studies are a commonly used alternative to ascertain the effectiveness of a&#xD;
      treatment. They are used to observe a treatment effect in a selected group of patients who&#xD;
      are presumed to derive benefit from the treatment given. Although methodologically not as&#xD;
      robust, and therefore prone to bias, they have some benefits over RCTs. The principal ones&#xD;
      are those of enhanced external validity (many patients do not wished to be randomised and&#xD;
      therefore refuse participation), and more rapid accrual compared to a randomised design. For&#xD;
      this reasons, a single arm medium term follow-up cohort intervention study has been designed.&#xD;
      At the time of writing the safety and tolerability aspects of focal therapy by HIFU are known&#xD;
      as a result of the Phase I/II studies carried out at UCLH. The results have been presented&#xD;
      and exist in the public domain in abstract form but have not yet been published (presented in&#xD;
      tables above). These early studies were powered to detect a change in the proportion of men&#xD;
      who could obtain an erection sufficient for penetration compared to their status prior to&#xD;
      their treatment. The very low event rate for both erectile dysfunction and incontinence&#xD;
      indicates that the 'proof of concept' has been demonstrated for focal therapy. Moreover, we&#xD;
      can be relatively confident that, in expert hands, focal HIFU is safe. Therefore, a&#xD;
      multi-centre study is now required involving a larger group of patients for the following&#xD;
      reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate medium term cancer control using histological parameters. Stage two of INDEX&#xD;
           will evaluate conversion to radical and systemic therapies and link men to national&#xD;
           databases to determine survival in 5 and 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To confirm that focal therapy can lead to low rates of genitourinary and rectal toxicity&#xD;
           and minimal impact on quality of life within a large and more representative cohort of&#xD;
           patients (greater precision around outcome measures).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To demonstrate that the skills (characterization through template prostate mapping and&#xD;
           MRI as well as the treatment related skills) acquired by the team at UCLH are indeed&#xD;
           transferable to other providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To calculate costs of care and to model potential cost-effectiveness in comparison to&#xD;
           alternative therapies. If this single arm intervention study demonstrates acceptable&#xD;
           outcomes to support the findings of the Phase I/II studies, it is anticipated that this&#xD;
           preliminary study will lead onto a Phase III evaluation of focal therapy, prior to more&#xD;
           widespread use of this technology.&#xD;
