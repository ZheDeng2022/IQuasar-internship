    <textblock>
      It is a multicenter, single arm treatment, phase II study of the combination in one treatment&#xD;
      arm with Lenalidomide, Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who qualify for participation will receive lenalidomide plus dexamethasone and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide in 4-week cycles. Subjects will be seen (study visits) every 2 weeks for the&#xD;
      first 3 cycles of therapy and monthly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cycles of lenalidomide/dexamethasone/cyclophosphamide will consists of lenalidomide 15 mg by&#xD;
      mouth for 21 days followed by 7 days rest and 300 mg/m2 of cyclophosphamide on days 1 and 8&#xD;
      plus oral dexamethasone 20 mg/day on days 1-4 and 9-12 given at 4-week intervals. Patients&#xD;
      will be treated with 6 cycles of therapy with the option to continue beyond as long there is&#xD;
      evidence of response. In this case the dose of lenalidomide will be the same and the dose of&#xD;
      the dexamethasone will be administered only on days 1 to 4 of each cycle and the dose of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide only day 1 during 6 cycles. After 12 cycles if the patients remaining in&#xD;
      response, will be treated with 10 mg/day, cyclophosphamide day 1, and dexamethasone will be&#xD;
      administered on days 1 to 4 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 3 cycles, patients will be followed for adverse events with hematologic control&#xD;
      every 2 weeks and monthly thereafter. Patients will be required to have a blood work-up&#xD;
      including total serum protein and serum protein electrophoresis, urine protein studies and a&#xD;
      clinical visit before each cycle. Organ involvement will be assessed every 4 cycles during&#xD;
      the first year of therapy. Hematologic response will be assessed every 3 months and organ&#xD;
      response every 6 months after the first year of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment modifications will be based on adverse events graded according to the Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE Version 3.0).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 30 patients enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial consists of three periods: pre-treatment, treatment and follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-treatment phase: include the enrolment visit in order to determine if the patient is&#xD;
      eligible to participate in the study. The patient will sign the Informed Consent Form to take&#xD;
      part in the study, and will receive detailed information about the treatment, its benefits&#xD;
      and risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment phase: include the 12 cycles of 28 days treatment with Lenalidomide,&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide and Dexamethasone as induction therapy followed with low doses of&#xD;
      Lenalidomide and Dexamethasone during three years until progression or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up phase: Once the clinical trial has finished, patients will be followed during usual&#xD;
      clinical practice visits where progression, free survival and overall survival will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

             cells&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously untreated disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not candidates for up-front high-dose therapy/stem cell&#xD;
             transplantation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serologically measurable disease defined as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Evidence of a monoclonal light chain in serum and urine by immunofixation Raise of the&#xD;
        level of circulating free light chains above the ordinary limits and an abnormal&#xD;
        relationship kappa/lambda.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance status ECOG ≤ 2 (see Annex 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Laboratory tests results within these ranges:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1 x 10 9/ L. Platelet count ≥ 100 x 10 9/ L Serum creatinine&#xD;
        less than 3.0 mg/dL Serum bilirubin less than 3.0 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Females of childbearing potential (FCBP) must agree to: Know the teratogenic risks of the&#xD;
        study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
        Commit to use contraceptives during the 4 weeks before the start of this study drug&#xD;
        treatment, during the treatment and also 4 weeks after it, even amenorrheic cases. All of&#xD;
        it applies always except women committed to maintain sexual abstinence confirming it&#xD;
        monthly. Some of effective contraceptives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Birth control implant Levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine device. Depot&#xD;
        medroxyprogesterone acetate Tubal ligation Sexual intercourse only with a vasectomized&#xD;
        partner. The effectiveness of vasectomy must be confirmed by two semen analysis; the result&#xD;
        must be negative Inhibiting ovulation pill progesterone only (for example: desogestrel) if&#xD;
        it is determined that the patient doesn't use an effective contraceptive method will be&#xD;
        referred to a skilled health professional to receive advice on contraception, so that they&#xD;
        can begin to birth control measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        It's discouraged combine oral contraceptives in myeloma multiple women cases treated with&#xD;
        Lenalidomide combined with Dexamethasone due to high venous thromboembolism risk. In case&#xD;
        these kind of patient were having combined oral contraceptives, she must change to another&#xD;
        one of list above. Risks of venous thromboembolism will remain during the 3 or 4 weeks&#xD;
        after discontinue combine oral contraceptives treatment. Concomitant treatment with&#xD;
        dexamethasone reduces the effectiveness of contraceptive steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Implants and levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine systems are related to higher risks of&#xD;
        infections at the moment of the implant or when there is metrorrhagia. It should be&#xD;
        considered prophylactic treatment with antibiotics for neutropenic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Normally it's discouraged copper intrauterine devices because of the infection risk and&#xD;
        menstrual blood loss at the moment of the implant for patients with neutropenia or&#xD;
        thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Women patients must follow all warnings for an effective contraception, even if she is&#xD;
        amenorrheic.&#xD;

        Women patients must be aware about effects of pregnancy and go to a health care centre&#xD;
        urgently in case of pregnancy risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        She must take a pregnancy test with a minimum sensitivity of 25 mUl/ml, under medical&#xD;
        supervision, when the study visits or three days before the visit, when she were 4 weeks at&#xD;
        least using effective contraceptive methods. This requirement applies for women who&#xD;
        practice a complete and continuous sexual abstinence. Test should confirm that the patient&#xD;
        is not pregnant at the time of starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        She must take a pregnancy test, under medical supervision, each 4 weeks, even a pregnancy&#xD;
        test 4 weeks after the end of the study treatment, except in case of a confirmed tubal&#xD;
        ligation. Pregnancy test should be performed the day of the study's visit or during the&#xD;
        three days before it. This requirement also applies for childbearing women who practice a&#xD;
        complete and continuous sexual abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        - Male patients must: Undertake to use latex condoms during treatment with study medication&#xD;
        including all periods of interruption of doses, even one week after finishing treatment if&#xD;
        his partner is a woman of childbearing who doesn't use contraceptive methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Commit not to donate semen during treatment with study medication and even one week after&#xD;
        finishing treatment.&#xD;
