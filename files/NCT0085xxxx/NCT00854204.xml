  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the bioavailability (the degree to which a drug&#xD;
      becomes available in the body after administration) of 3 different pharmaceutical&#xD;
      preparations of a combination of two drugs, TMC114 and TMC41629. There will be 1 single oral&#xD;
      intake (intake by mouth) of each of the 3 preparations. The study will also investigate the&#xD;
      safety of use and the potential side effects of TMC114 and TMC41629, and determine the&#xD;
      circulating levels of both compounds in your blood over time (pharmacokinetics), after a&#xD;
      single intake.&#xD;

      TMC41629 is a new investigational drug for the treatment of HIV. TMC114, is also known as&#xD;
      Darunavir. In this randomized (study medication assigned by chance), open label trial&#xD;
      (investigator and healthy volunteer know the name of the study medication), each healthy&#xD;
      volunteer will receive a single dose of TMC114/TMC41629, in 3 subsequent sessions, Treatment&#xD;
      A, Treatment B and Treatment C. Each capsule is equivalent to a dose of 200 mg of TMC114 and&#xD;
      23.67 mg of TMC41629. Treatment A (immediate-release formulation) will serve as reference&#xD;
      formulation. All medication intakes will be orally and in fasted conditions.The study&#xD;
      duration is at least 19 days, excluding screening and follow-up visits with three single&#xD;
      intakes with 72 hours follow-up per intake. Each volunteer will receive a single dose of each&#xD;
      formulation. TMC114/TMC41629 is formulated as an oral immediate-release hard-gelatin capsule,&#xD;
      as an oral gastro-resistant hard-gelatin capsule, enteric-coated and as an oral&#xD;
      gastro-resistant hard-gelatin capsule, colon-targeted. Each capsule is equivalent to a dose&#xD;
      of 200 mg of TMC114 and 23.67 mg of TMC41629.&#xD;
