    <textblock>
      Standard therapy with Imatinib (IM) significantly prolongs the survival of Ph+CML patients&#xD;
      who obtain a complete cytogenetic response (CCgR). Elderly patients (i.e., at least 65 years)&#xD;
      have similar cytogenetic responses and survival, but they usually show a low compliance. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to evaluate the percentage of elderly patients who maintain a CCgR with&#xD;
      intermittent imatinib therapy with respect to standard daily administration.&#xD;

      Objective: The aim of the study is to investigate if the complete cytogenetic response (CCgR)&#xD;
      that has been achieved with standard (daily administration) Imatinib (IM) therapy can be&#xD;
      maintained with the same dose of IM given intermittently (INTERIM). For the purposes of this&#xD;
      study, the term &quot;standard IM therapy&quot; means the daily administration of IM at any dose&#xD;
      between 300 and 800mg, whereas, &quot;intermittent IM treatment&quot; (INTERIM), is defined as the same&#xD;
      daily dose of IM given one month on/one month off .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the proportion of patients who remain in&#xD;
      CCgR with INTERIM given for one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This study is an open-label, multicenter, Phase II study of INTERIM for the&#xD;
      maintenance of CCgR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Elderly patients (at least 65 years) with Ph+ CML and with stable CCgR&#xD;
      after at least 2 years of standard (daily administration ) IM therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan STUDY DRUG: Imatinib is registered as Glivec by Novartis Pharma Italy for&#xD;
      treatment of patients with Ph+ CML in any phase (CP and AP/BP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE AND SCHEDULE: Imatinib (Glivec) is given at the same daily dose that was given at the&#xD;
      time of the enrollment by the following intermittent schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 week on / 1 week off for the 1st month(weeks 1-4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 weeks on / 2 weeks off for the 2nd and the 3rd month(weeks 5-12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 month on / 1 month off from the 4th month thereafter(weeks 13 on)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT DURATION: The study has a duration of 12 months. After 12 months of intermittent&#xD;
      dose of IM (INTERIM) the patients who are in continuous CCgR are advised to continue study&#xD;
      treatment dose (INTERIM) but can go back to pre-study daily dose. Follow up is required&#xD;
      indefinitely for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy The primary efficacy variable of intermittent dose of IM (INTERIM) is measured by&#xD;
      the proportion of patients who maintain a stable CCgR over the whole study period (12&#xD;
      months). For the purposes of this study the monitoring of the cytogenetic response (CgR)&#xD;
      status will be evaluated by Fluorescence-in-situ-Hybridization (FISH) of interphase&#xD;
      peripheral blood cells (molecular cytogenetic analysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OFF TREATMENT EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients go off the study in case of failure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of CCgR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of CHR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Progression to AP/BP or in case of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's refusal&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documentation of serious adverse events (SAE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protocol violation&#xD;
&#xD;
      OFF-TREATMENT THERAPEUTIC RECOMMENDATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of Loss of CCgR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  intermittent dose of IM (INTERIM) has to be STOPPED&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  evaluation of additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACA) by conventional&#xD;
                (morphologic) cytogenetics has to be performed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mutational analysis of BCR-ABL transcript has to be checked&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  and pre-study IM standard therapy (daily dose administration) has to be RESUMED&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of Loss of CHR or Disease Progression to AP/BP&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  intermittent dose of IM (INTERIM) has to be STOPPED&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  and it is recommended to move to investigational available treatments, based on&#xD;
                cytogenetic and molecular data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of SAE: it is recommended to discontinue IM forever&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of Refusal or Protocol Violation: it is recommended to go back to pre-study IM&#xD;
           dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Treatments All patients who are enrolled in this study have already been treated&#xD;
      with IM for a minimum of 2 years. Therefore, it is expected that the problems concerning&#xD;
      concomitant treatments have already been considered and that the investigators and the&#xD;
      patients are familiar with them. However, it is wise to remind that IM is a competitive&#xD;
      inhibitor of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4/5. Interactions are possible when IM is administered with&#xD;
      drugs whose metabolism is dependent on or which a1ter levels of these P450 cytochrome&#xD;
      isoenzymes. When drugs classified as 'substrates' are co-administered with IM, there is the&#xD;
      potential for higher concentrations of the 'substrate'. When IM is co-administered with&#xD;
      compounds classified as 'inhibitors', increased plasma concentrations of Imatinib is the&#xD;
      potential outcome. Particular attention is drawn to the potential interaction between IM and&#xD;
      acetaminophen, anticoagulants (especially warfarin) and anticonvulsants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Schedule, Assessments and Follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical evaluation and physical examination, including height, weight, vital signs and&#xD;
           other relevant findings will be assessed at the time of enrollment (baseline) and every&#xD;
           3 months during the study (12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiac function assessment will be performed by echocardiography at baseline, and at&#xD;
           the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood count including Hb, Plt count, WBC and differential will be performed at baseline&#xD;
           and will be monitored every 3 months during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serum chemistry, including BUN, creatinine, AST, ALT, ALP, bilirubin, Ca, P, K and Mg,&#xD;
           total protein concentration and electrophoretic profile, IgG, IgA, IgM concentration&#xD;
           will be performed at baseline and every 3 months during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The cytogenetic response (CgR) status has to be evaluated at baseline and every 3 months&#xD;
           during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At baseline (BL) the cytogenetic response (CgR) status must be evaluated by&#xD;
                conventional (morphologic) AND by molecular cytogenetics (FISH) analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The monitoring of the cytogenetic response (CgR) status (months 3, 6, 9 and 12)&#xD;
                will be evaluated only by Fluorescence-in-situ-Hybridization (FISH) of interphase&#xD;
                peripheral blood cells (see section 11.1 page 19). FISH has the potential advantage&#xD;
                of i) evaluating many more cells and of using peripheral blood instead of marrow,&#xD;
                ii) reducing missing information by conventional morphologic evaluation of marrow&#xD;
                cells metaphases, iii) improving the compliance of patients for cytogenetic&#xD;
                monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If FISH documents a variation of the baseline value of more than 1%, check again&#xD;
                the CgR by a second FISH analysis after 1 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If the second FISH analysis confirms a variation of the baseline value of more than&#xD;
                1%, conventional cytogenetics by evaluation of marrow cells metaphases has to be&#xD;
                performed to confirm the Cytogenetic Response Loss (CgR loss) and to check for&#xD;
                additional cytogenetic abnormalities (ACA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative molecular assessment of BCR-ABL transcript by RQ-PCR on peripheral blood&#xD;
           sample is due at baseline and every 3 months during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mutational analysis has to be performed in case of loss of CCgR on marrow cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow up is required indefinitely for all patients by standard hematologic, cytogenetic&#xD;
           and molecular criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size This study has been designed according to the optimal Simon's two stage&#xD;
      procedure, based on data of the annual rates of treatment failure reported in 454 patients&#xD;
      receiving IM in the multicenter, open-label, phase III randomized international study IRIS.&#xD;
      The optimal two-stage design to test the null hypothesis that P&lt;= 0.850 versus the&#xD;
      alternative that P&gt;= 0.950 has an expected sample size of 33.7 and a probability of early&#xD;
      termination of 0.602. If the INTERIM regimen is not effective (in the sense of maintaining a&#xD;
      complete cytogenetic response less than 0.85), there is a 0.049 probability of concluding&#xD;
      that it is (the target for this value was 0.050). If the INTERIM regimen is effective (in the&#xD;
      sense of maintaining a complete cytogenetic response more than 0.85), there is a 0.200&#xD;
      probability of concluding that it is not (the target of this value was 0.200). A total of 78&#xD;
      patients have to be enrolled, 13 in the first stage and 65 in the second stage. The Trial&#xD;
      Advisory Committee (TAC) will monitor the accrual and the cytogenetic response status every 3&#xD;
      months and will stop the study if the loss of the CCgR is more than 15.4% and 9.2% in the&#xD;
      first and second stage, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Time Trial time is 12 months. Thereafter, all patients are followed by standard&#xD;
      hematologic, cytogenetic and molecular criteria, indefinitely.&#xD;
