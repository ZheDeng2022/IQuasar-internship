  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial is studying how well dasatinib works in treating patients with malignant&#xD;
      salivary gland tumors that have come back after treatment or have spread to other parts of&#xD;
      the body. Dasatinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed&#xD;
      for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the objective response rate (complete response plus partial response) of&#xD;
      dasatinib in adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the progression-free survival of dasatinib in ACC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the duration of response. II. Determine the stable disease rate and duration of&#xD;
      stable disease. III. Determine progression-free survival. IV. Determine the median survival.&#xD;
      V. Determine the overall survival. VI. Determine the safety and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To examine biomarkers that relate to SRC proto-oncogene, non-receptor tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      (Src) signal transduction and to correlate these biomarkers with clinical response to&#xD;
      dasatinib in ACC and non-ACC malignant salivary gland tumors (MSGT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine if activating mutations in platelet-derived growth factor alpha polypeptide&#xD;
      (PDGFA) and KIT are associated with response in ACC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dasatinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-28. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 8 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Response rate is percentage of the best overall response which recoded from the start of the treatment until diseases progression/recurrence. Response criteria are defined using the international criteria proposed by the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST) Committee: Complete Response, Disappearance of all target lesions; Partial Response, &gt;=30% decrease in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions; Progressive Disease, 20% increase in the sum of the longest diameter of target lesions, or a measurable increase in a non-target lesion, or the appearance of new lesions; Stable Disease, neither sufficient shrinkage to qualify for partial response nor sufficient increase to qualify for progressive disease, no occurrence of progression disease for non-target lesions, and no new lesions.</description>

    <measure>Progression-free Survival</measure>

    <measure>Changes in Laboratory Correlates</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in laboratory correlates pre-post therapy will be analyzed using paired t-tests. The association between RET gene rearrangements/mutations and tumor response, as well as the association between germ-line polymorp response, will be analyzed using Fisher's exact test. The correlative and genetic data will also be entered as cova only due to the small sample size) in a Cox regression model of progression-free survival.</description>
