      Thrombin is the most potent activator of platelets, and platelet activation is a hallmark of&#xD;
      thrombosis. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in&#xD;
      the United States and other industrialized countries, and thrombotic sequelae are the key&#xD;
      cause of death in diabetes. The accumulation of thrombin at sites of vascular injury provides&#xD;
      one of the major mechanisms of recruiting platelets into a hemostatic plug. Thrombin works by&#xD;
      activation of the G protein-coupled protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 on human&#xD;
      platelets to initiate signaling cascades leading to increases in [Ca]i, secretion of&#xD;
      autocrine activators, trafficking of adhesion molecules to the plasma membrane, and shape&#xD;
      change, which all promote platelet aggregation. The thrombin receptors work in a progressive&#xD;
      manner, with PAR1 activated at low thrombin concentrations, and PAR4 recruited at higher&#xD;
      thrombin concentrations. As direct thrombin inhibitors become widely used in clinical&#xD;
      practice, it is important to assess their effects on vascular function. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that PAR1 and PAR4 do not signal through the same G protein pathways, and that PAR4 is not a&#xD;
      strong platelet agonist. To investigate this hypothesis, the investigators will study the G&#xD;
      protein pathways downstream of PAR4, and assess ex-vivo platelet responsiveness to thrombin,&#xD;
      PAR1, and PAR4 agonist peptides, both in normal human subjects, and along the stages of&#xD;
      pathology, from patients with stable angina as well as unstable angina who are undergoing&#xD;
      angioplasty. Similarly, the investigators will examine platelet function in patients with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome as well as diabetes, along the continuum from insulin resistance to&#xD;
      full-blown disease. These studies will provide deeper insight into the G protein pathways&#xD;
      used by PARs. They will elucidate the contribution of PAR receptors to normal platelet&#xD;
      function as well as the abnormal platelet activation in thrombotic states. The long term goal&#xD;
      is to understand the implications for PAR receptors as therapeutic targets for anti-platelet&#xD;
      therapies that may carry less bleeding risk.&#xD;

      Thrombin is the major protease in the coagulation cascade whose pleiotropic actions can&#xD;
      ultimately lead to thrombosis and tissue injury. Thrombin is the key effector of the&#xD;
      coagulation cascade and converts fibrinogen to fibrin which is essential for laying the mesh&#xD;
      work for clot formation. Further, thrombin also provides positive feedback by converting&#xD;
      inactive coagulation factors into their active state, thereby generating more thrombin. In&#xD;
      addition, thrombin displays a diverse range of effects in vascular cells that functionally&#xD;
      connects tissue damage to both hemostatic and inflammatory responses. Many of the cellular&#xD;
      effects of thrombin are initiated via activation of a family of Protease-Activated Receptors&#xD;
      (PARs) which are coupled to heterotrimeric G proteins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in the United States, accounting&#xD;
      for over 39% of deaths and over $350 billion in annual health care costs in this country.&#xD;
      Current pharmacological therapy for treatment of diseases caused by blood clots, such as&#xD;
      heart disease and stroke, often involve the use of drugs that do not reflect current&#xD;
      scientific understanding of these pathologies. Acute coronary syndrome is a thrombotic event,&#xD;
      and platelet activation plays a critical role in the formation of intravascular thrombus at&#xD;
      the site of arterial injury or plaque rupture. Medical management of acute coronary syndrome&#xD;
      is centered on anti-platelet therapies, however, current anti-platelet drugs do not fully&#xD;
      attenuate platelet activation, can have delayed onset and long durations of action and may&#xD;
      result in significant morbidity due to bleeding complications. With increasing numbers of&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with ACS, bleeding complications become a&#xD;
      major concern in this new era of anti-platelet and coagulation therapies. The direct thrombin&#xD;
      inhibitor bivalirudin was associated with a significant reduction of in-hospital bleeding&#xD;
      complication as compared to heparin plus IIbIIIa inhibitors in patients undergoing PCI, while&#xD;
      composite clinical endpoints (death, MI, repeated revascularization) were maintained. An&#xD;
      explanation for the lack of superiority of direct thrombin inhibitors when compared to&#xD;
      heparin, could be that direct thrombin inhibitors also block the anticoagulation and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory effects of thrombin thereby potentially altering the risk/benefit ratio. In&#xD;
      addition, all of the agents used in treating ACS have undesirable side effects such as&#xD;
      bleeding. An agent that would selectively block the inflammatory and thrombotic effects of&#xD;
      thrombin by selectively blocking PAR activation, without altering the protective APC pathway&#xD;
      or inhibiting fibrin generation (bleeding) would potentially have more of a desirable&#xD;
      risk/benefit ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the known roles of proteases and PARs in coagulation, inflammation, pain, healing and&#xD;
      protection, the need for development of a PAR antagonist as a therapeutic agent for treatment&#xD;
      of thrombosis, atherosclerosis and inflammation is well-recognized. Thus, blocking PAR action&#xD;
      by inhibiting the PAR-G protein interface is an alternative target for blocking downstream&#xD;
      consequences of thrombin-mediated cellular activation. Since there are two PARs on human&#xD;
      platelets, PAR1 and PAR4, it is critical to define the roles of both receptors in several&#xD;
      likely clinical settings where PAR antagonists would be used. In this proposal both the G&#xD;
      protein pathways underlying PAR signaling mechanisms as well as their roles in pathologies&#xD;
      characterized by activated platelets will be studied in detail. We propose in this grant to&#xD;
      investigate the specific roles of individual PARs in mediating the events leading to the&#xD;
      multi-stage process of platelet activation and clot formation. The long term goals of these&#xD;
      studies are to determine novel PAR-specific anti-platelet therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In defining which G protein mediates the effects of different PARs on platelets, we will&#xD;
      target that particular receptor-G protein interface using the C-terminus of the particular G&#xD;
      alpha that mediates the response. We have used overexpression of the native C-terminal&#xD;
      peptides of different G proteins to determine which G protein signaling pathway is involved&#xD;
      in physiological responses in endothelial cells. As this method is not applicable to&#xD;
      platelets, which are not transfectable, we propose to create membrane-permeable versions of&#xD;
      Gα C-terminal peptides that would be acutely deliverable to platelets to tease out signaling&#xD;
      pathways. The roles of G proteins in platelet activation in mice has been studied extensively&#xD;
      through the use of knockout technology. The most striking phenotype was in mice lacking G&#xD;
      alpha q. They demonstrate an absence of platelet aggregation and are protected against&#xD;
      thromboembolism. Recently, the role of G alpha 13 in platelets has been uncovered through the&#xD;
      use of an inducible mouse line lacking G alpha 13. Previously the role of G alpha 13 was&#xD;
      unknown as these mice die in utero from defects in angiogenesis. Surprisingly, absence of G13&#xD;
      in mice platelets leads to a reduced potency of thrombin, TXA2 and collagen to induce&#xD;
      platelet shape change and aggregation. The specific roles of G proteins in platelet&#xD;
      activation in humans has been less well studied, because of the lack of a tractable genetic&#xD;
      approach and the inability to transfect human platelets. One study has identified a patient&#xD;
      with diminished Gαq activity (50% of Gαq immunoreactivity compared to normal) who also had&#xD;
      impaired agonist-induced platelet aggregation and secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant differences exist in the expression patterns of G proteins and PARs between mouse&#xD;
      and human platelets. Perhaps the biggest difference is that thrombin activation of mouse&#xD;
      platelets is mediated through PAR3 and PAR4, while thrombin activation of human platelets is&#xD;
      mediated through PAR1 and PAR4. This was made very clear as thrombin was still able to&#xD;
      activate platelets in PAR1 knockout mice. Murine PAR3 is unable to signal to downstream&#xD;
      effectors and functions to present thrombin to PAR4 in platelets, as PAR4 lacks the&#xD;
      hirudin-like sequence and does not bind thrombin efficiently. By contrast, human PAR3 has&#xD;
      been proposed to signal through thrombin-triggered phosphoinositide hydrolysis, however, its&#xD;
      functional role remains to be established. Mice platelets only express Gαq while not&#xD;
      expressing Gα11, which most likely explains the more severe phenotype with Gαq knockout mice&#xD;
      compared to the other knockout mice. However, human platelets may contain G alpha 11, in&#xD;
      addition to G alpha q, although this has been viewed with controversy. Our dominant-negative&#xD;
      G protein peptide strategy should now allow us to directly study PAR-G protein signaling in&#xD;
      human platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the leading cause of death in the world. The lifetime risk&#xD;
      of having coronary heart disease after age 40 is 49% for men and 32% for women. The AHA&#xD;
      estimates that more than 12 million people have some form of CAD history. This will increase&#xD;
      with the aging of the baby boom generation. Research spanning nearly three decades has firmly&#xD;
      established the role of platelet activation in the pathophysiology of ACS. In contrast to the&#xD;
      central role of platelet activation in the pathogenesis of unstable angina and acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, a major role for platelet activation in the setting of chronic stable&#xD;
      angina has not been widely acknowledged. Coronary angioplasty leads to vessel wall injury and&#xD;
      exposure of subendothelial structures with resultant platelet activation that may limit the&#xD;
      early and late success of the procedure. In contrast with the findings in patients with&#xD;
      stable angina, patients referred for angioplasty exhibit more consistent increases in&#xD;
      platelet activation prior to their intervention. Platelet aggregation and the expression of&#xD;
      activated GPIIbIIIa and P-selectin are increased in patients referred for coronary artery&#xD;
      stenting or angioplasty. In contrast, increased concentrations of circulating markers of&#xD;
      platelet activation in patients following angioplasty have been reported by some but not all&#xD;
      groups. Based on the REPLACE-2 trial of bivalirudin, interventional cardiologists at&#xD;
      Vanderbilt and around the world are increasingly using bivalirudin as the anticoagulant of&#xD;
      choice for PCI. We will examine the effects of blocking thrombin on PAR signaling in&#xD;
      platelets from subjects with normal coronary arteries as well as patients undergoing PCI. We&#xD;
      have carried out preliminary studies of platelet aggregation before and after bivalirudin&#xD;
      infusion in patients from Vanderbilt's Coronary Catheterization Laboratory. As expected,&#xD;
      thrombin mediated aggregation of ex vivo platelets is inhibited by bivalirudin (data not&#xD;
      shown). Therefore, we hypothesize that removing the protective effect of basal thrombin on&#xD;
      the vasculature could change the platelet PAR1 or PAR4 signaling state. This possibility has&#xD;
      not been examined, and it is important that such studies be conducted, as direct thrombin&#xD;
      inhibition becomes a more widely used therapeutic strategy in acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies were designed to study PAR signaling and G protein activation states in&#xD;
      patients with platelet activation in the setting of the continuum of the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and diabetes mellitus. The degree of platelet activation as determined by assays of platelet&#xD;
      reactivity and by the expression of markers of platelet activation will be correlated with&#xD;
      the changes in PAR signaling. These studies will provide a comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
      platelet activation in the setting of the metabolic syndrome, and will compare the extent of&#xD;
      activation in this setting with that in a group of contemporaneously studied patients with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. Finally, the influence of the direct thrombin inhibitor, bivalirudin on&#xD;
      platelet activation and signaling will be assessed.&#xD;
