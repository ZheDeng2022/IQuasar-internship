  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Usually, the male hormone testosterone makes prostate cancer cells grow. Lowering&#xD;
      testosterone usually stops the growth of prostate cancer. However, after a period of time&#xD;
      without testosterone, prostate cancer cells learn to grow again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You are able to join this trial because your prostate cancer is growing even though you have&#xD;
      very low levels of testosterone. Studies have shown that high doses of testosterone, in this&#xD;
      situation, can cause prostate cancer cells to stop growing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators did a study several years ago in which the investigators gave high doses of&#xD;
      testosterone to patients such as yourself. The investigators showed that giving testosterone&#xD;
      in this situation was safe. The investigators also showed that the investigators could, in&#xD;
      some cases, make the PSA go down using high-dose testosterone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that they can improve this type of treatment by combining&#xD;
      testosterone with another drug called dutasteride. Dutasteride is another type of hormone. It&#xD;
      should make testosterone levels rise. The investigators believe that combination of&#xD;
      dutasteride and testosterone will be more a more powerful regimen against your cancer than&#xD;
      testosterone alone.&#xD;

    <description>This trial is a multi-center, open-label, phase II trial of the combination of exogenous testosterone (AndroGel®) with the 5α-reductase inhibitor dutasteride in patients with castration-resistant metastatic prostate cancer.</description>

    <description>Patients will be treated with dutasteride 3.5 mg once daily (oral administration). To avoid rapid conversion of testosterone to DHT in case 5α-reductase is not adequately inhibited during the first few days of concurrent treatment with dutasteride and testosterone, daily dutasteride treatment will be initiated 7 days prior to testosterone initiation.&#xD;
Patients will receive AndroGel® at the dose of 15 g (3 times the standard replacement dose for hypogonadism) once daily (topical administration), starting on Day 8 and continuing for 12 weeks (or until disease progression or withdrawal from the study).</description>
