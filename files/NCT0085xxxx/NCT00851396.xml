  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to assess the relationship between vitamin D status and insulin-&#xD;
      glucose dynamics in obese Adolescents. The study is intended to assess the difference in the&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity before and after correction of vitamin D deficiency.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vitamin D deficient subjects are identified initially through an existing study. Those&#xD;
      identified with vitamin D deficiency are notified and subsequently treated with standard&#xD;
      therapy for vitamin D deficiency as part of their clinical care. Patients who self report&#xD;
      that they have taken the treatment are enrolled in this study. Patients will be evaluated in&#xD;
      this study with measurement of serum 25 OH D level, PTH and oral glucose tolerance test. The&#xD;
      study will assess if there is improvement in glucose- insulin sensitivity dynamics once the&#xD;
      serum 25OH D level is normalized&#xD;

    <description>Obese adolescents will be screened for vitamin D deficiency through an existing study. Those found to be vitamin D deficient will be given standard treatment of vitamin D deficiency. In this study, patients who self report that they had taken the treatment for vitamin D will be screened for serum 25 OH D level and will undergo OGTT. The OGTT results as well as insulin resistance indices will be compared to their initial values.</description>
