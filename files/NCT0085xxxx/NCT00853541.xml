      Heart failure (HF) is a major public health problem, which affects about 5 million&#xD;
      Americans.HF is when the heart muscle does not pump as much blood as the body needs. As a&#xD;
      result of this,the body has difficulties in keeping an optimal fluid status. The fluid status&#xD;
      of the body is regulated by both the heart and the kidneys. Due to the strong interaction&#xD;
      between the heart and the kidneys, heart failure can result in a slight decreased kidney&#xD;
      function as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that people who primarily suffer from chronic kidney disease (CKD) have a higher&#xD;
      risk of developing arterial calcifications. Calcification of the arteries is caused by&#xD;
      deposits of calcium within the walls of the blood vessels. Calcifications of the arteries may&#xD;
      result in a loss of elasticity of the blood vessels. Recent research studies have shown that&#xD;
      people with CKD have stiffer blood vessels which in these people, is associated with a higher&#xD;
      chance of developing cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it is not known whether a decrease in kidney function in people with HF results in&#xD;
      arterial calcification as well. In addition, it is not known whether this is also associated&#xD;
      with a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases (diseases of the heart and blood&#xD;
      vessels.) We are asking you to take part in this study because you have HF combined with some&#xD;
      decrease in your kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see whether people with HF and a decrease in kidney function&#xD;
      do have a higher chance of developing arterial calcifications. We will do this by comparing&#xD;
      the results of the following; 1) several blood tests, 2) pictures taken of your heart by&#xD;
      echocardiogram and computed tomography (CT) scan, and 3) measurements of the elasticity of&#xD;
      your arteries. All of these tests are routinely used in clinical care. However, there have&#xD;
      not been any research studies that have compared these results to see how they relate to&#xD;
      arterial calcification in people with HF who have a decrease in kidney function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We also want to see whether people with HF and a decreased kidney function are at a higher&#xD;
      risk of developing cardiovascular diseases. This study is being performed at Massachusetts&#xD;
      General Hospital (MGH), in Boston Massachusetts. We expect to enroll a total of 150 subjects&#xD;
      at MGH.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The interaction between cardiac and renal (dys)function has been a highly relevant, yet&#xD;
      poorly understood phenomena to both clinicians and scientists. More than 50% of the heart&#xD;
      failure patients suffers from renal impairment, defined as a creatinine clearance &lt; 60&#xD;
      ml/min,while renal impairment is one of the most powerful predictors of outcome in heart&#xD;
      failure.However, the complex mechanism why renal insufficiency is associated with a worse&#xD;
      outcome, is still not fully elucidated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was presumed that in the setting of acute heart failure, cardiac output reduces, which is&#xD;
      counteracted by systemic and other responses such as a decrease in renal blood flow, in order&#xD;
      to retain circulating fluid and restore cardiac output.Yet, heart failure patients with&#xD;
      deterioration in renal function are not necessarily those with the poorest ventricular&#xD;
      function, lowest cardiac output or the lowest blood pressures.It is therefore hypothesized&#xD;
      that renal impairment is not merely a marker of end-stage heart failure, but is associated&#xD;
      with a myriad of pathophysiological processes which may influence prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the consequences of renal insufficiency that usually remains unnoticed by&#xD;
      cardiologists, is a disregulation in the calcium and phosphate homeostasis. Yet, especially&#xD;
      hyperphosphatemia is present in 50% of the pre-dialysis patients and is an important&#xD;
      independent predictor of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiological mechanisms behind this process are intensively studied. In vitro&#xD;
      studies show that elevated phosphate concentrations induce differentiation of vascular smooth&#xD;
      muscle cells (VSMC) via Cbfa1 to osteoblast-like cells. These osteoblast-like cells are&#xD;
      capable of producing bone matrix proteins, which may subsequently regulate mineralization.&#xD;
      Once mineralization is initiated, increased Ca x PO4 product from (ab)normal bone metabolism,&#xD;
      secondary hyperparathyroidism, or excessive calcium intake may accelerate this process&#xD;
      leading to vascular calcification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum phosphate concentrations are regulated by fibroblast growth factor 23 (FGF-23), a&#xD;
      circulating protein which may protect the transition of VSMC into osteoblast-like cells by&#xD;
      lowering phosphate concentrations.Studies with FGF-23 null mice revealed extensive vascular&#xD;
      calcification of the media layer in arteries.FGF-3 was also strongly related to vascular&#xD;
      calcification in patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD), while there was no association&#xD;
      found with atherosclerosis in subjects with normal renal function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fetuin-A, also a circulatory protein, inhibits the de novo formation and precipitation of&#xD;
      mineral basic calcium phosphate, but does not dissolve it once the basic calcium phosphate is&#xD;
      formed. Therefore, fetuin-A can prevent undesirable calcification in the circulation without&#xD;
      inhibiting bone mineralization. Serum levels of fetuin-A in individual dialysis patients are&#xD;
      indeed inversely correlated to coronary artery calcification on CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matrix-carboxyglutamic acid protein (MGP), a calcification inhibitor, is a&#xD;
      vitamin-K-dependent protein synthesized by chondrocytes and VSMC.MGP knockout mice develop&#xD;
      severe calcifications of the arterial media layer.However, only carboxylated MGP seems to&#xD;
      inhibit the process of calcification and the inhibition of MGP carboxylation by the vitamin K&#xD;
      antagonist warfarin resulted in extensive calcification of arteries in vitro as well as in&#xD;
      vivo.This is explained by the fact that during warfarin treatment undercarboxylated MGP&#xD;
      (uc-MGP) is synthesized, which is inactive. It was recently found that uc-MGP serum&#xD;
      concentrations were negatively associated with phosphate levels and positively with fetuin-A&#xD;
      and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) concentrations, suggesting that low uc-MGP&#xD;
      concentrations may be a marker of active calcification.Besides, low uc-MGP concentrations are&#xD;
      inversely related to both the aortic augmentation index, a marker of arterial stiffness, as&#xD;
      well as to coronary artery calcification diagnosed on CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interestingly, the process of vascular calcification in renal impairment seems not to be a&#xD;
      process of accelerated atherosclerosis, i.e plaque (de)formation, but of more severe&#xD;
      calcification besides existing atherosclerosis. It is shown in autopsy specimens from ESRD&#xD;
      patients and matched controls that the plaque area and volume were not different in the two&#xD;
      groups, but the plaque was more calcified in the ESRD population. Furthermore, intimal&#xD;
      thickness was not different between the two groups as well, whereas medial thickness was&#xD;
      significantly greater in the ESRD patients. In addition,a 2- to 5-fold increase in coronary&#xD;
      artery calcification is found in dialysis patients compared with age-matched non-dialysis&#xD;
      patients with angiographically proven coronary artery disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An elegant, new diagnostic technique which seems to be ideal for imaging coronary&#xD;
      calcification, is the coronary artery calcification score (CAC-score) as measured by&#xD;
      electron-beam computed tomography (EBCT).This technique enables to objectify coronary artery&#xD;
      calcification without the application of any nephrotoxic contrast agent. Although this would&#xD;
      be an ideal tool for diagnosing coronary artery disease in patients where classical contrast&#xD;
      agents could potentially be harmful, there is debate about the role of CAC determination in&#xD;
      cardiovascular medicine. Indeed, recently an AHA/ACC panel of experts stated that the role of&#xD;
      CAC is still undetermined. Because of the variability of reported data and the large variance&#xD;
      of calcium scores in the asymptomatic population, a clear definition of a CAC score threshold&#xD;
      for application to the general population is problematic. For a cutoff threshold in the&#xD;
      100-200 range of Agatston score, most population studies have found that although the&#xD;
      negative predictive value is very high (0.95-0.99), the positive predictive value is rather&#xD;
      low (0.02-0.13).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is a positive correlation between the site and the amount of coronary artery&#xD;
      calcium and the percent of coronary luminal narrowing at the same anatomic site, the relation&#xD;
      is nonlinear and has large confidence limits.The relation of arterial calcification, like&#xD;
      that of angiographic coronary artery stenosis, to the probability of plaque rupture is&#xD;
      unknown and there is a broad variation in the correlation between CAC and angiographically&#xD;
      proven coronary artery disease in patients without renal impairment. Interestingly however,&#xD;
      it was found that CAC on EBCT correlated well with serum concentrations of calcium and&#xD;
      phosphate in ESRD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While there is uncertainty about the exact association with plaque instability, vascular&#xD;
      calcification does lead to arterial stiffness.Arterial stiffness can be objectified by&#xD;
      functional parameters such as the pulse wave velocity (PWV) or the augmentation index&#xD;
      (AIx).It has been previously demonstrated that CAC strongly correlates with these parameters&#xD;
      of arterial stiffness.Interestingly, it was found that PWV is an independent predictor of&#xD;
      future coronary events, while patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention who&#xD;
      have an increased AIx, are at the highest risk for a future coronary event.Furthermore, in a&#xD;
      population of patients with renal impairment it was found that PWV significantly correlates&#xD;
      with both vascular calcification on CT as well as serum phosphate concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Via an increase of pressure throughout systole and a decrease in pressure throughout&#xD;
      diastole, arterial stiffness results in an increase of cardiomyocyte oxygen demand. While an&#xD;
      acute increase in load increases tension-time index and acute oxygen demand, chronic increase&#xD;
      enhances basal oxygen requirements. This process of increased coronary blood flow&#xD;
      requirements, associated with a decreased ability to supply, develops independently of&#xD;
      coronary narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although small studies indeed suggest that heart failure patients have higher serum phosphate&#xD;
      concentrations, the prevalence and prognostic role of hyperphosphatemia or any disturbances&#xD;
      in the calcium and phosphate balance of heart failure patients with renal impairment have&#xD;
      never been the specific subject of investigation in a larger population. The correlation&#xD;
      between coronary artery calcification, arterial stiffness and coronary events in this&#xD;
      population is unknown as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We designed this study in order to investigate the prevalence of calcium and phosphate&#xD;
      disturbances and their correlates with other markers such as fetuin-A, uc-MGP and FGF-23,&#xD;
      vascular calcification on EBCT and functional parameters of arterial stiffness.Secondly, we&#xD;
      want to optimize the application of the CAC score in this population, where classical&#xD;
      contrast agents are contra-indicated, by adding serological and or functional parameters to&#xD;
      this score. Thirdly, we aim to study the prognostic role of all these parameters.&#xD;
