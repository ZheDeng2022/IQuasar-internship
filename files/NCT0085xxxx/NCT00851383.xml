    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Ad35-GRIN/ENV HIV&#xD;
      vaccine and Ad35-GRIN HIV vaccine administered intramuscularly at 0 and 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I dose-escalation randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of Ad35-GRIN and Ad35-ENV filled in the same vial and&#xD;
      administered as a single, combined vaccine. This is the first administration of this vaccine&#xD;
      in humans. The study will be double blind with respect to vaccine or placebo. The vaccine&#xD;
      will be administered intramuscularly at months 0 and 6 at three dose levels: 2 x 10^9, 2 x&#xD;
      10^10, and 2 x 10^11 vp per dose. Volunteers will be randomized to vaccine: placebo in a 10:4&#xD;
      ratio in each group. A fourth group was added as a protocol amendment to study Ad35-GRIN HIV&#xD;
      vaccine alone at 1x10^10 vp in 14 volunteers (10:4 vaccine:placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers will be screened up to 42 days before vaccination (90 days for Ad35 neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody screening) and will be followed for 12 months after the last vaccination (18 months&#xD;
      total study participation). Estimated enrollment will take approximately 5 months. Thus, the&#xD;
      total duration of the study would be approximately 23 months.&#xD;
