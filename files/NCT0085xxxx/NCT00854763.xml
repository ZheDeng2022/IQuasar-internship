      We will conduct an open label, non-comparative, observational study to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of Olmesartan therapy in Taiwan patients with essential hypertension,&#xD;
      and the primary objective is the change in the 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure from&#xD;
      baseline to the day after post-treatment week-12 visit according to the ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring.&#xD;

      Vitamin D plays an important role for cardiac function and blood pressure regulation, and the&#xD;
      serum 25(OH)D concentration change is an important indicator for Vitamin D nutritional&#xD;
      status, and serum 1,25(OH)2D is an active hormone for biological actions. However, little is&#xD;
      known about the change of vitamin D concentration was related to the usage of angiotensin&#xD;
      receptor blocker among patients with hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will conduct an open label, non-comparative, observational study to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of Olmesartan therapy in Taiwan patients with essential hypertension,&#xD;
      and the primary objective is the change in the 24-hour mean systolic blood pressure from&#xD;
      baseline to the day after post-treatment week-12 visit according to the ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring. Our second endpoints included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change in the 24-hour mean diastolic blood pressure from baseline to the day after&#xD;
           post-treatment week-12 visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the reduction in office blood pressure, including SeSBP and SeDPB, with&#xD;
           Olmesartan 20mg therapy at 4,8,12 weeks (only for subjects with week-4, week-8 visit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Control rate [% of patients] at 12weeks, defined by Defined as SBP less than 140mmHg and&#xD;
           / or DBP less than 90mmHg or a reduction more than 10 mmHg for DBP and / or more than&#xD;
           20mmHg SBP versus baseline values&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Biomarker assessment Vitamin D change from the baseline 24-hour urinary sodium excretion&#xD;
           change from the baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of Olmesartan 20mg at 12 weeks based on global&#xD;
           assessment by the physicians and patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major aim of this proposal is to investigate the effect of angiotensin receptor blocker,&#xD;
      Olmesartan, for a 12 weeks' treatment among patients with hypertension in the outpatient&#xD;
      clinics in one hospital center. We set the blood pressure measured from ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure monitor as the primary endpoint. Furthermore, we will test Vitamin D related&#xD;
      concentrations and 24 hour urine sodium excretion change with the blood pressure change. We&#xD;
      will recruit 200 patients with hypertension in this observational study and will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety issues among these patients. The specific aims of this proposal will&#xD;
      include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test the improvement of blood pressure change in 24-hour blood pressure monitor by an&#xD;
           angiotensin receptor blocker, Olmesartan, among hypertensive patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test the change of vitamin D concentrations and 24-hour urinary sodium excretion change&#xD;
           after this angiotensin receptor blocker, Olmesartan, treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Test the association between blood pressure change and vitamin D-related measurements&#xD;
           among the drug treatment, We hypothesize that the blood pressure change was related to&#xD;
           the change of serum vitamin D concentration and also related to urinary sodium excretion&#xD;
           change. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The unique feature of this proposal includes a well-designed observational study with&#xD;
      experienced clinicians and epidemiologists to conduct the study. Under the infrastructure in&#xD;
      a tertiary hospital center, participant compliance, follow up, quality control and outcomes&#xD;
      measurements can be assured and monitored under the guideline of good clinical practice.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the investigators are the experts in vitamin D associated measurements and&#xD;
      biomarkers studies and in clinical setting. This proposal will provide important scientific&#xD;
      knowledge about the relationship among blood pressure change, vitamin D and urinary sodium&#xD;
      excretion among hypertensive patients under 12 weeks' angiotensin receptor blocker treatment&#xD;
      in Taiwan.&#xD;
