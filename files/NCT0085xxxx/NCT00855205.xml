  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a inflammatory disease affecting many parts of the body, especially the lungs.&#xD;
      While most patients do well, there is a group of patients who require continuous doses of&#xD;
      prednisone or other drugs. The current study will determine the role of Rituximab as new&#xD;
      agent for patients with refractory disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with refractory pulmonary sarcoidosis will be eligible for participation in this&#xD;
      open label trial of Rituximab as additional therapy. The study will evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      rituximab in improving the symptoms and functional capacity in patients with chronic&#xD;
      sarcoidosis with pulmonary involvement who are symptomatic despite current treatment.&#xD;
