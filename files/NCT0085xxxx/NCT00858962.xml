  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this protocol is to study the effect of an HIV medication known as&#xD;
      Raltegravir on Buprenorphine in people who have been receiving the same dose of Buprenorphine&#xD;
      for at least 3 weeks before study entry. This will be determined by giving Raltegravir along&#xD;
      with Buprenorphine and by measuring the amount of Raltegravir and Buprenorphine in the blood.&#xD;
      The investigators will also learn about the effects of Buprenorphine on Raltegravir and about&#xD;
      the safety of taking these two medications together.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A large number of people who are infected with HIV have acquired it through injection drug&#xD;
      use. Some of these people are currently being treated with Buprenorphine for their addiction&#xD;
      and with medications for HIV infection. Raltegravir is a medication that was approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of HIV infection. Raltegravir acts by&#xD;
      making it more difficult for the virus that causes AIDS to multiply and cause more damage to&#xD;
      the immune system in someone who is HIV infected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier studies looking at the effect of Buprenorphine and HIV medications have shown that&#xD;
      Buprenorphine and some HIV medications act differently when taken together. It is important&#xD;
      to learn if taking Buprenorphine and HIV medications together results in changes in the blood&#xD;
      level of either medication. If the HIV medication affects the level of Buprenorphine in the&#xD;
      blood, an individual taking Buprenorphine and HIV medications may experience symptoms of&#xD;
      withdrawal, even while taking their usual dose of Buprenorphine. On the other hand, if&#xD;
      Buprenorphine decreases the amount of HIV medication in the blood, then the HIV medication&#xD;
      may be less effective in controlling HIV infection. It is therefore important to learn if&#xD;
      Raltegravir and Buprenorphine will affect each other when taken together.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to learn about the effects of Buprenorphine and Raltegravir, we will need to measure&#xD;
      the amount of Buprenorphine in your blood for 24 hours before you have taken Raltegravir and&#xD;
      then compare that to the amount of Buprenorphine in your blood after you have taken&#xD;
      Buprenorphine and Raltegravir together .&#xD;

          <description>HIV negative subjects currently enrolled in Buprenorphine maintenance therapy on a stable dose of BUP for at least 3 weeks were admitted to the HRU for PK sampling at intervals over a 24 hour period. Subjects then received RAL and BUP co-administration for a minimum of 4 days after which a second series of blood draws at intervals over a 24 hour period were conducted.</description>

    <certain_agreements>
      <pi_employee>Principal Investigators are NOT employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>The only disclosure restriction on the PI is that the sponsor can review results communications prior to public release and can embargo communications regarding trial results for a period that is less than or equal to 60 days. The sponsor cannot require changes to the communication and cannot extend the embargo.</restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The sample size was small, though within the range of similar drug-drug interaction studies. This study utilized a within-subject design with patients acting as their own controls (thereby resulting in less intra-patient variability).</limitations_and_caveats>
