      RATIONALE: Stereotactic body radiation therapy may be able to send x-rays directly to the&#xD;
      tumor and cause less damage to normal tissue. Vertebroplasty may help prevent fractures and&#xD;
      spinal cord compression caused by spinal metastasis. Giving stereotactic body radiation&#xD;
      therapy together with vertebroplasty may help lessen pain and improve quality of life of&#xD;
      patients with spinal metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      together with vertebroplasty works in treating patients with localized spinal metastasis.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the efficacy of stereotactic body radiotherapy in reducing pain at 3 months&#xD;
           in patients with localized spinal metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the duration of pain response at the treated site(s) scored as the time of&#xD;
           maximal pain relief to an increase of 2 points on the Visual Analogue Scoring System.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the functional preservation of improvement as measured by the Brief Pain&#xD;
           Inventory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To prospectively assess quality of life using the FACT-G and EQ-5D questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the long-term stability of the treated vertebral bone (e.g., fracture,&#xD;
           sclerotic change, vertebral body height, or malalignment) as measured by MRI, CT scan,&#xD;
           and plain radiographs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups according to prior radiotherapy to&#xD;
      the planned treatment site(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo 5 fractions of stereotactic body&#xD;
           radiotherapy (SBRT) over 30-90 minutes each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (no prior radiotherapy): Patients undergo 1 fraction of SBRT over 30-90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 1 month after the initiation of SBRT, patients in both groups undergo percutaneous&#xD;
      vertebroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete pain and quality-of-life questionnaires at baseline and periodically during&#xD;
      study. Patients also undergo MRI and CT scan at baseline, at 1, 3, and 6 months, and then&#xD;
      every 6 months for 3 years to assess changes in vertebral bone strength and stability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed at 2 weeks, at 1, 3, and 6 months,&#xD;
      and then every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
