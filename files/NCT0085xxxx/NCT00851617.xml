      Patients under threshold IMT show better conditions to weaning from mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      than the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  After at least 48 hours on CMV, the patients in PSV were randomized into two groups:&#xD;
           control group and IMT group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before each protocol session, the cardiorespiratory variables such as f, HR, MAP and&#xD;
           SpO2, as well as the support ventilatory variables such as PSV, PEEP, FiO2 and trigger&#xD;
           sensitivity, were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After collecting the first records, the patients were placed in a 45º Fowler position,&#xD;
           and variables MIP and MEP were collected with a unidirectional valve, as well as f, VE,&#xD;
           Vt and f/Vt.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The IMT group was trained using the threshold IMT device with a 40% MIP load. Each&#xD;
           training session consisted of 5 sets with 10 breaths, twice a day. Supplementary oxygen&#xD;
           was added if necessary during the protocol. The training was cancelled in the presence&#xD;
           of tachyarrhythmia, reduction of SpO2 under 85% and in the presence of fatigue signs or&#xD;
           respiratory dysfunction. In this case, the patients returned to MV. All&#xD;
           cardiorespiratory variables (f, HR, MAP and SpO2) were recorded again one minute after&#xD;
           the end of the protocol. The same data were recorded in the control group before and&#xD;
           after the protocol, but the patients were not trained with the threshold IMT device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients were followed up until weaning. During this period, laboratory tests were&#xD;
           recorded, such as: potassium, sodium and magnesium as well as arterial gasometry,&#xD;
           calculating the partial pressure of arterial oxygen/fraction of inspired oxygen&#xD;
           (PaO2/FiO2) ratio.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients included in this study were under MV for more than 48 hours of CMV and&#xD;
             ventilated with pressure support ventilation (PSV) between 12 and 15 cmH2O, with&#xD;
             positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) between 5 and 7 cmH2O, hemodynamically stable&#xD;
             without vasoactive drugs (dopamine, dobutamine or norepinephrine) or sedative agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This study excluded hypotensive patients (systolic blood pressure &lt; 100 mmHg or mean&#xD;
             blood pressure &lt; 70 mmHg), severe intracranial disease and sensory reduction,&#xD;
             barotrauma, tracheotomy, neuromuscular disease and the use of vasoactive drugs or&#xD;
