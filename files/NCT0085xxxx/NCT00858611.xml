      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a prime-boost study regimen that includes the&#xD;
           recombinant DNA vaccine followed by licensed 2008/2009 FluLaval(Registered Trademark) in&#xD;
           adults ages 18-50 years and adults ages 51-70 years as compared with control groups that&#xD;
           receive the licensed vaccine only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether the study participants in each age group receiving a prime-boost&#xD;
           schedule have a greater frequency of H1 or H3 neutralizing antibodies compared with&#xD;
           those of the same age group who received only the 2008/2009 trivalent influenza vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate differences in antibody or T cell responses (quantity, quality, or&#xD;
           durability) between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants ages 18 to 70 years of age who are available for clinic follow-up through&#xD;
           Week 24 and who have no previously undiagnosed clinically significant chronic diseases.&#xD;
           Participants will provide blood samples for further testing to determine eligibility.&#xD;
           Females must not be or become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Volunteers who have been immunized with the current season FDA-approved influenza&#xD;
           vaccine (2008-2009), or who are being treated for tuberculosis may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study lasts for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 0: The first day of Week 0 (i.e., Day 0) is defined as the day of enrollment and&#xD;
           first injection. Specific eligibility is reviewed. Participants will receive an&#xD;
           injection of either the DNA vaccine VRC-FLUDNA047-00-VP (at 4 mg dosage) or a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Week 4: All study participants will receive an injection of the trivalent seasonal&#xD;
           influenza vaccine, according to the manufacturer's package insert directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be given 7-day diary cards on which to record temperature and symptoms&#xD;
           (e.g., muscle aches, headache, chills, nausea) and injection site reactions (e.g., pain,&#xD;
           tenderness). Participants may also enter this information via the Internet. Presence of&#xD;
           symptoms may require additional visits to the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will return to the clinic 2 weeks after each injection for the following&#xD;
           procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws for further tests to determine the immune system's response to the&#xD;
           vaccine(s) Clinical evaluations: vital signs and weight, examinations of the lymph&#xD;
           nodes, and targeted physical exam on any visit if indicated by interim complaints or&#xD;
           laboratory findings.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, randomized study in healthy younger (18-50 years) and older (51-70 years)&#xD;
      adults. For each age group, the study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of a prime-boost vaccination regimen against the seasonal influenza virus with&#xD;
      an investigational plasmid DNA vaccine as a prime followed 4 weeks later by the seasonal&#xD;
      influenza trivalent inactivated vaccine (TIV) boost as compared to the seasonal TIV alone.&#xD;
      Equal numbers of healthy adults in each age group will receive the DNA vaccine as the first&#xD;
      injection or a control injection with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) as the first injection.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that the DNA vaccine will be safe for human administration and that the&#xD;
      prime-boost schedule will elicit a higher titer antibody response than the seasonal TIV&#xD;
      alone. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability and induced&#xD;
      antibody titer of the investigational prime-boost regimen, at a dose of 4 mg for the DNA&#xD;
      vaccine and 45 micrograms ((Micro)g) for the seasonal TIV vaccine. Secondary and exploratory&#xD;
      objectives are related to the humoral and cellular immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inactivated seasonal influenza vaccine is the trivalent subunit virion vaccine for the&#xD;
      2008-2009 season. Each dose is composed of 45 (Micro)g hemagglutinin (HA) in 0.5 mL; with the&#xD;
      recommended ratio of 15 (Micro)g HA of each of the following 3 strains:&#xD;
      A/Brisbane/59/2007-like (H1N1); A/Brisbane/10/2007-like (H3N2), A/Uruguay/716/2007, and&#xD;
      B/Florida/4/2006-like. The VRC-FLUDNA047-00-VP vaccine was developed and manufactured by VRC,&#xD;
      NIAID and is composed of 3 closed-circular DNA plasmids, each with a CMV/R promoter that&#xD;
      encode for 2008-2009 strains of the H1, H3 and B proteins. DNA vaccine vials will be supplied&#xD;
      at 4 mg/mL and each dose will be 1 mL. The placebo for the DNA vaccine is PBS. Vaccination&#xD;
      will be administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle using needle and syringe for&#xD;
      the seasonal influenza vaccine and the Biojector(Registered Trademark) 2000 Needle-Free&#xD;
      Injection Management System (Biojector) for the DNA vaccine (or placebo) injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 healthy adults will be enrolled; 40 in the 18-50 year age group and 40 in the&#xD;
      51-70 year age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two groups in the study that are based on age. Subjects in each group will be&#xD;
      randomized into one of two vaccination schedules. Each age group is randomized at a ratio of&#xD;
      1:1 to either the DNA prime-TIV boost schedule or the placebo-TIV schedule. Subjects and&#xD;
      clinicians will be blinded to assignment to DNA vaccine or placebo for first injection until&#xD;
      all subjects have completed Study Week 8. All subjects will receive the seasonal influenza&#xD;
      TIV vaccine as the second injection. The initial enrollments in each group will occur no&#xD;
      faster than 4 in the first week. Before completing enrollment, there will be a study pause&#xD;
      with review by the Protocol Safety Review Team (PSRT) when there is at least 1 week of safety&#xD;
      follow-up on this initial group of 8 subjects' (4 in each group) first injections. Half of&#xD;
      the subjects will have received placebo; therefore at the time of this safety review 4&#xD;
      injections of the investigational DNA vaccine will have been administered. A report will be&#xD;
      provided to the Data and Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB), which will review the study twice&#xD;
      per year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol requires 6 clinic visits and 2 telephone follow-up contacts for all groups. This&#xD;
      study also includes a substudy of the consent process in collaboration with the NIH Clinical&#xD;
      Center Department of Bioethics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (18-50 years), 40 subjects enrolled, Group 1A: n=20 and Group 1B: n=20 will received&#xD;
      DNA IM Biojector at Day 0 and Flulaval(Registered Trademark) IM Needle at Day 28 (plus or&#xD;
      minus 7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (51-70 years), 40 subjects enrolled, Group 1A: n=20 and Group 2B: n=20 will received&#xD;
      DNA IM Biojector at Day 0 and Flulaval(Registered Trademark) IM Needle at Day 28 (plus or&#xD;
      minus 7 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      TOTAL: 80 subjects; Day 0 injection is blinded and Day 28 is open label.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will complete 24 weeks of clinical follow up.&#xD;
