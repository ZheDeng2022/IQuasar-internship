    <textblock>
      The objective of this open-label, randomized, two-period crossover study was to compare the&#xD;
      oral bioavailability of a Mallinckrodt test tablet formulation of hydromorphone 8 mg to an&#xD;
      equivalent oral dose of a commercially available hydromorphone tablet (DILAUDID® 8 mg, Knoll&#xD;
      Pharmaceutical Company) in a test group of healthy subjects under fasting conditions.&#xD;

             or practicing adequate non-hormonal contraception for at least 3 months prior to and&#xD;
             for the duration of study participation. All female subjects will undergo a pregnancy&#xD;
             test at screening and at check-in to the clinical study site for every dosing period.&#xD;
             The results of the test must be negative for continued participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Weight must be within 15% of the ideal weight for height and frame, as adopted by the&#xD;
             Metropolitan Life Insurance Co., 1993.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Qualifying subjects must be in good health and physical condition as determined by a&#xD;
             screening medical history obtained within 30 days prior to study start. Subjects&#xD;
             should not present with a history of significant past illness expected to affect the&#xD;
             investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The normal status of subjects will be confirmed by the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Laboratory tests (serum chemistry, hematology, urinalysis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), hepatitis, alcohol, and &quot;drugs of abuse&quot;&#xD;
                  testing will be done at screening. Results of the HIV, hepatitis, alcohol, and&#xD;
                  &quot;drugs of abuse&quot; tests must be negative or non-reactive for&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Electrocardiogram: A 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) will be obtained for all&#xD;
                  subjects. This ECG must be interpreted by appropriately trained and experienced&#xD;
                  medical personnel. A subject with an ECG that is not within normal range does not&#xD;
                  qualify, unless specifically accepted (with comment) by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects must be able to provide written consent and agree to abide by the study&#xD;

             or neurological disorder capable of altering the absorption, metabolism, or&#xD;
             elimination of drugs or constituting a risk factor when taking hydromorphone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of anxiety, tension, severe agitation, psychosis, or mental depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Family history or diagnosis of epilepsy or other seizure disorder.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. History of conditions that might contraindicate or require caution be used in the&#xD;
             administration of hydromorphone including: renal impairment, hepatobiliary or&#xD;
             pancreatic disease, GI obstruction, cardiac disease, obstructive pulmonary disease,&#xD;
             acute or severe bronchial asthma, hypercarbia, elevated intracranial pressure,&#xD;
             depleted blood volume, paralytic ileus, or allergy to hydromorphone, any opiate&#xD;
             agonists, or naltrexone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Administration of any other investigational drug during the 30 days prior to&#xD;
             enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who smoke or have a history of smoking, or use nicotine-containing products.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects who have donated blood within 30 days prior to study entry, including that&#xD;
             withdrawn during the conduct of any other clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Subjects presenting with acute illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who have taken prescription drugs within 14 days or over-the-counter&#xD;
             medications (including herbal preparations) within 7 days prior to dosing except for&#xD;
