  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mutations detected in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have been show to produce very high risks&#xD;
           of breast and ovarian cancer (as high as 90% and 60%, respectively), as well as&#xD;
           accompanying risks for several other types of cancer. Women who have these genetic&#xD;
           anomalies and who do not have cancer are aware of their high-risk status, which can have&#xD;
           an effect on their ability to make decisions about personal choices and health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers are interested in learning more about how people who know their cancer risk&#xD;
           status make decisions on personal relationships, family formation, and risk-reduction&#xD;
           options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study young women s experiences and decision-making processes regarding family history,&#xD;
      genetic testing, couple relationships, family formation, and cancer risk management within&#xD;
      the context of their experiences as BRCA1/2 mutation carriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women between the ages of 18 and 35 years of age and older who have been identified as&#xD;
           having a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Participants must be contemplating or have experienced&#xD;
           couple relationships, family formation, and/or risk management and reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must be willing to have their interviews digitally recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will conduct between 30 and 50 telephone interviews of study participants.&#xD;
           Each interview will be approximately 90 minutes in length. The interview consists of&#xD;
           open-ended questions that ask about the participants and their experiences before,&#xD;
           during, and after they underwent genetic testing for BRCA1/2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least one focus group will be coordinated at a national conference for individuals&#xD;
           who are aware of their genetically based cancer risk. If more than 25 individuals are&#xD;
           interested in participating in the group, an additional focus group will be convened.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No medical treatments are specifically offered as a part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BRCA1/2 mutations are present in approximately 1 in 800 individuals in the US, with&#xD;
           higher frequency among some populations (e.g., Ashkenazi Jews)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mutations confer a lifetime breast cancer risk approaching 90%, ovarian cancer risk as&#xD;
           high as 60%, and lesser increases in absolute risks of selected other cancers (e.g.,&#xD;
           male breast, prostate, pancreas).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We have successfully conducted follow-up interviews with women in our original studies&#xD;
           who had known about their mutations for less than six months, and have gleaned useful&#xD;
           longitudinal data. We now propose to conduct additional follow-up interviews with&#xD;
           participants who were in the process of making significant decisions about&#xD;
           risk-management, relationships, family formation, and other pertinent issues at the time&#xD;
           of their initial interviews.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additionally, previous research indicates that women who undergo genetic testing very&#xD;
           early in young adulthood (i.e., prior to their 25th birthdays) have genetic counseling&#xD;
           and support needs that are different from the broader BRCA-positive population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Research regarding how these very young mutation carriers manage and accommodate their&#xD;
           risk is scarce. We propose to conduct two focus groups with women who considered and/or&#xD;
           underwent genetic testing for BRCA prior to their 25th birthdays, who are attending the&#xD;
           Joining FORCES annual conference in Orlando, FL June 23-25, 2011.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Study Application has been updated with this amendment to reflect the following&#xD;
           changes: 1) the inclusion of males who may be enrolled only in the Family Group&#xD;
           Interview component of the study &amp; 2) the inclusion older individuals as some women may&#xD;
           wish to include male or older members of their family in Family Group Interview portion&#xD;
           of the study. To reflect this change the maximum age for study participants has been&#xD;
           increased to 100 years of age and males are no longer listed as excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For follow-up to previous study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -- Conduct follow-up telephone interviews with participants who were newly-tested at the&#xD;
           time of original data collection to increase understanding of their mutation-positive&#xD;
           experience longitudinally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 25 &amp; Under study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Conduct two (2) focus group sessions at the Joining FORCES Annual Conference,&#xD;
                focusing on the unique genetic counseling and support needs of women who consider&#xD;
                or undergo genetic testing for BRCA1/2 prior to age 25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For follow-up to previous study:&#xD;
&#xD;
           -- Individuals who were in the process of making decisions relative to their status as&#xD;
           mutation positive at the time of their previous interviews will be re-interviewed, in&#xD;
           order to learn about their longitudinal experiences and expand the data set.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 25 &amp; Under study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women aged 18-24 who have received a positive BRCA1/2 mutation test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Women aged 25-30 who considered or completed genetic testing for BRCA1/2 prior to&#xD;
                their 25th birthdays&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  English-speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Attending the 2011 Joining FORCES Annual Conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For follow-up to previous study:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Individuals will be invited to participate in a second telephone interview, during&#xD;
                which they will be asked to describe their mutation-related experience since their&#xD;
                previous interviews (approximately two years ago).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Questions for each participant will be specifically tailored based on their&#xD;
                previous interview data. Telephone interviews are anticipated to be approximately&#xD;
                60 minutes in length.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  **Note: In cases where an individual eligible for follow-up is also participating&#xD;
                in the multi-generational family interview (see Amendment A), the individual&#xD;
                interview conducted as part of that study will take the place of a follow-up&#xD;
                telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For 25 &amp; Under Study&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Individuals who meet eligibility criteria will be invited to participate in either&#xD;
                of two focus group sessions being held during the FORCE conference.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Following the conference, each participant will be contacted via telephone to&#xD;
                complete a brief family history interview, in order to provide context for the data&#xD;
                collected during the focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Focus groups will be conducted using a prepared guide (see attachment).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants will be entered into a raffle at each session, and one participant in&#xD;
                each session will win a $50 gift card.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Focus group sessions and telephone family history interviews will be audio&#xD;
                recorded; then, they will be transcribed and analyzed using modified grounded&#xD;
                theoretical design and QSR NVivo v8 software.&#xD;
