  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We are inviting individuals such as yourself, who have diaphyseal fracture (broken bone) with&#xD;
      a non union to participate in this research study. A non-union is a lack of bone healing&#xD;
      (bone growth where the break in the bone occurred) after 3 months after the operation. The&#xD;
      diaphyseal is an area of a specific bone (usually near the middle) where the fracture&#xD;
      occurred. The bones we are interested in are the clavicle (collar bone), tibia (lower leg),&#xD;
      femur (upper leg), humerus (upper arm) and forearm (lower arm). Treatment goals for these&#xD;
      types of fractures are to minimize later surgeries, to assist the healing process, and to&#xD;
      decrease the time to healing. The ability of a patient with non-union (lack of bone healing&#xD;
      after 3 months post operation) to return to the work force and to normal activities more&#xD;
      quickly not only has a good financial impact on society (community), but also improves&#xD;
      over-all physical and mental well-being of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Infuse&quot; is a synthetic bone morphogenic protein which means it has the ability to help your&#xD;
      bone to form and heal if inserted in the fracture site. &quot;Infuse&quot; may be the first&#xD;
      commercially available product approved by Health Canada to accelerate the healing of long&#xD;
      bone non-unions requiring surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the safety and efficacy of Infuse has been demonstrated through numerous&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies, further human clinical trial is needed to evaluate the safety and the&#xD;
      power to produce effects of this product particularly with respect to non unions of long&#xD;
      bones. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and the power to produce effects&#xD;
      of Infuse implanted during treatment of long bone non unions to reduce later surgeries&#xD;
      required to augment the healing process and to accelerate the time to healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given this, the orthopaedic community has planned this study in order to scientifically&#xD;
      establish the most effective treatment method to restore function after this type of injury.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a multi-centre Canadian randomized Study wherein 80 patients are randomized (put&#xD;
      in groups by no standard pattern ie. flipping a coin) to receive both autograft (sample of&#xD;
      your own bone: iliac crest) and allograft (bone chips from bone bank) or &quot;infuse&quot; (synthetic&#xD;
      bone morphogenic protein) and allograft using locked plates. Locked plates are surgical&#xD;
      plates placed on the fracture in which the screws lock into the plate when they have been&#xD;
      completely screwed into the bone through holes on the plate. Our objective is to assess the&#xD;
      total cost of the patients treated in both study group and the benefits of the Infuse by&#xD;
      comparing the new bone formation in the fracture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will monitor critical aspects of operative care and rehabilitation at regular intervals,&#xD;
      up to 2 year after surgery. We will independently monitor revision surgery (surgeries to&#xD;
      repair a previous surgery) rates. We will also assess patients for functional health and&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes.&#xD;
