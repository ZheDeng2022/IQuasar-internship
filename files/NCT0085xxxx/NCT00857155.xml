      Purpose: In patients with coronary artery disease, aspirin and Plavix are used increasingly&#xD;
      to prevent the formation of blood clots in the coronary arteries. These drugs exert their&#xD;
      beneficial effects by irreversibly blocking platelets, the compounds found in blood&#xD;
      responsible for clotting after an injury or during a heart attack. However, these effects&#xD;
      also place patients at increased risk for bleeding after coronary artery bypass surgery.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is currently recommended to withhold Plavix therapy for 5 days before&#xD;
      undergoing surgery in order to reduce the incidence of bleeding. However, it has been&#xD;
      repeatedly shown that Plavix exerts variable effects on different patients, which may be&#xD;
      partially explained by poor absorption, drug-drug interaction, and by variations in&#xD;
      deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) which constitutes your genes. In addition, the time required for&#xD;
      platelets to regain function after Plavix treatment has been shown to vary between patients.&#xD;
      Therefore, by measuring platelet function, it may be possible to determine the optimal amount&#xD;
      of time required to withhold Plavix before undergoing bypass surgery, which may improve rates&#xD;
      of bleeding following the procedure. The purpose of this study is to classify patients into&#xD;
      groups based on platelet function in order to define the ideal time period for delaying&#xD;
      surgery. By analyzing the amount of time required for platelet recovery, it is expected that&#xD;
      surgery-related bleeding will decrease without increasing the risk of blood clot formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Approximately 200 patients requiring CABG will be enrolled at Sinai Hospital,&#xD;
      which is the only site where this study is being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible you must:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be able to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Be between the ages of 18-85 and require CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently be on aspirin therapy (81-325mg).&#xD;

      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that stratifying patients on clopidogrel into time-based platelet function&#xD;
      recovery groups as determined by pre-operative clopidogrel response measured by point of care&#xD;
      methods will result in similar rates of bleeding as compared to those of clopidogrel naïve&#xD;
      patients undergoing elective CABG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single center, prospective study analyzing clopidogrel naïve patients and&#xD;
      patients on clopidogrel with background aspirin therapy requiring CABG.&#xD;
