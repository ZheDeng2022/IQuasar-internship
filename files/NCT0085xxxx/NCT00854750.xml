      The investigators principal hypothesis is that INO and optic neuritis are objective,&#xD;
      quantitative, and reproducible models for corroborating the hypothesis that changes in core&#xD;
      body temperature are associated with the reversible and stereotypic decay in axonal&#xD;
      conduction and that ACTHAR can serve to prevent such changes. The application of ocular motor&#xD;
      and optic nerve measures appears to constitute a useful paradigm to detect and monitor&#xD;
      responses to therapeutic strategies that stabilize nerve cell membranes in response to&#xD;
      temperature induced decay in axonal conduction mechanisms, with implications on activities of&#xD;
      daily life that are dependent upon vision (reading, driving, walking, work performance).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A quantum leap forward in our understanding of MS pathophysiology was provided by the&#xD;
      discovery of myelin by Louis Ranvier in 1878, and by Pierre Marie who first suggested in 1892&#xD;
      that demyelination represented a critical element in MS pathology.1 In 1925 Lord Edgar&#xD;
      Douglas Adrian reported the first electrical recordings of nerve transmission.2 Ultimately&#xD;
      six Nobel prizes were awarded for contributions directly related to the characterization of&#xD;
      the nerve impulse and the role played by myelin, a monumental achievement of modern biology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While working at the University of Otago in New Zealand, Dr. W. Ian McDonald (who passed away&#xD;
      on December 13, 2006) was the first to provide objective evidence that demyelination in MS&#xD;
      was associated with a corresponding change in the transmission of electrically coded messages&#xD;
      within nerve axons.3-5 He noted that the disruption of myelin led to a reduction in axonal&#xD;
      cross sectional area and thereby a reduction in conduction velocity, loss of saltatory&#xD;
      conduction, with a predilection to conduction block. Understanding this conspicuous aspect of&#xD;
      MS pathophysiology allows us to predict many of the reversible symptoms described by our&#xD;
      patients, particularly those that are provoked or intensified by elevated ambient or core&#xD;
      body temperature, exercise, and infection. Such processes appear to compromise the safety&#xD;
      threshold for high fidelity nerve transmissions. This phenomenon was also recognized&#xD;
      clinically by Wilhelm Uhthoff in 1899, when he evaluated optic neuritis patients who&#xD;
      experienced reversible and stereotypic alterations in vision after exercise or exposure to&#xD;
      heat.6 MS exacerbations (via inflammation, edema, and demyelination) and sustained&#xD;
      progression of disability (via gliosis, sustained demyelination, and neurodegeneration)&#xD;
      represent formidable challenges of the disease process that have partially yielded to a&#xD;
      series of disease modifying therapeutic strategies.7 However, in most patients, bona fide&#xD;
      exacerbations typically occur infrequently (perhaps a few per year, even in those not using&#xD;
      treatment), and disability progression takes time (many years in most). Alternately,&#xD;
      fluctuations in neuronal activity can be induced by a variety of factors with great frequency&#xD;
      and variability (provoked over minutes, hours, days, or weeks) and correspondingly results in&#xD;
      a compromise of functional capabilities such as vision, reading, driving, walking, work&#xD;
      performance, cognitive processing, and the execution of activities of daily living. In&#xD;
      essence, these frequent, transient, typically stereotypic and reversible physiologic changes&#xD;
      constitute a major component of MS related disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notwithstanding the important achievement of validating the favorable effects of disease&#xD;
      modifying agents in MS, a major and recalcitrant challenge, that should be at the forefront&#xD;
      in MS therapeutics, is a focus on reducing the consequences of symptoms collateral to the&#xD;
      disease process. Such symptoms include fatigue, weakness, gait dysfunction, spasticity, heat&#xD;
      intolerance, pain, cognitive changes, sensory disturbances, bowel, bladder, sexual&#xD;
      dysfunction, depression, and hopelessness.8 While the underpinnings of these complaints are&#xD;
      manifold, changes in axonal conduction mechanisms now represent a well-recognized and&#xD;
      cardinal feature of MS pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A deeper understanding on how novel interventions might serve to enhance the axonal 'safety&#xD;
      factor' to thermal perturbations (ambient, surface, and core body temperature) could lead to&#xD;
      the identification of new treatment strategies for enhancing physiologic performance in CNS&#xD;
      pathways involved in the organization of physical and intellectual capabilities. An important&#xD;
      randomized controlled study systematically demonstrated the long-term benefits of acute and&#xD;
      chronic cooling on objective as well as patient reported measures of neurologic function.9 It&#xD;
      would be important to also understand how active heating impacts upon similar measures, and&#xD;
      whether preemptive cooling is protective in response to a heat stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose that neuro-ophthalmologic hallmarks of MS, INO (an ocular motor syndrome) and&#xD;
      optic neuritis (a visual sensory syndrome), can be studied with objective methods (infrared&#xD;
      oculography and VEPs respectively) to better understand the factors that provoke or prevent&#xD;
      the reversible conduction changes in demyelinated axons, within highly discrete tract systems&#xD;
      and whether a specific drug treatment, ACTHAR Gel, can mitigate heat induced worsening of&#xD;
      ocular motor and anterior visual system dysfunction. Such studies would appear to be germane&#xD;
      to the development of new treatment approaches focused on optimizing the fidelity of axonal&#xD;
      conduction in demyelinated pathways, and providing elusive outcome measures for some Phase II&#xD;
      trials. Education efforts to inform patients and health care providers on the pervasive&#xD;
      nature of thermally induced symptoms in MS (and the potential impact on daily activities),&#xD;
      could lead to effective strategies to enhance performance and safety. There has been a&#xD;
      paucity of research and education on this very conspicuous and important aspect of MS and its&#xD;
      impact upon patients, families, and the workplace.&#xD;
