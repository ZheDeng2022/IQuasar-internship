      Background: Alcoholic liver disease is one of the most important causes of chronic liver&#xD;
      disease in this country. There is currently no treatment for chronic alcoholic liver disease&#xD;
      other than abstinence. Hepatic methionine metabolism is abnormal in these patients and one of&#xD;
      the consequences is depletion of S-adenosylmethionine (SAMe) levels, which can affect&#xD;
      numerous important cellular processes. SAMe has been increasingly utilized for the treatment&#xD;
      of liver diseases although the protective mechanisms remain unclear. A recent randomized&#xD;
      double-blind trial using SAMe in patients with alcoholic liver disease and found improvement&#xD;
      in 2-year survival in those with less advanced liver disease. However, important changes in&#xD;
      methionine metabolism and histological changes were not included in the study. Aim: The goal&#xD;
      of this study is to determine the effect of SAMe administration on key metabolic&#xD;
      abnormalities of the methionine cycle and on the recovery from alcoholic liver disease.&#xD;

      Methods: This is a randomized, double blind, placebo-controlled trial. Thirty patients with&#xD;
      stable alcoholic hepatitis (Maddrey Score &lt; 32) without cirrhosis who meet entry criteria&#xD;
      will receive either 400 mg of SAMe (n=15) or placebo (n=15) three times a day for the&#xD;
      duration of one year. History, physical assessment, various blood tests and a liver biopsy&#xD;
      will be performed prior to treatment. Patients will have repeat blood tests on subsequent&#xD;
      follow-up visits every month for the first two months, then every two months thereafter. They&#xD;
      will also be encouraged to abstain from alcohol during these visits. A post-treatment liver&#xD;
      biopsy will be obtained at the end of the trial. The primary outcome parameters include serum&#xD;
      homocysteine, SAMe and TNFalpha levels, and the expression of key hepatic enzymes of the&#xD;
      methionine cycle and of hepatic SAMe and glutathione levels. Histological progression of&#xD;
      alcoholic liver disease, clinical and biochemical indices of liver disease, and quality of&#xD;
      life assessment will also be examined.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be chronic alcohol users, defined by a history of ethanol consumption on&#xD;
             average &gt; 40g/day for women and 60g/day for men for at least 1 year before inclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presumptive diagnosis for alcoholic hepatitis will be: recent binge drinking;&#xD;
             compatible physical findings (one or more: jaundice, enlarged liver, hepatic bruit,&#xD;
             abdominal pain, loss of appetite, nausea); and a compatible biochemical profile&#xD;
             (moderate elevation of AST over ALT, elevated total serum bilirubin); or a&#xD;
             liver-spleen colloid scan suggestive of reticulo-endothelial redistribution and&#xD;
             hepatic arterialization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The diagnosis of alcoholic hepatitis must be confirmed on liver biopsy, showing&#xD;
             typical features of acute sclerosing hyaline necrosis 70.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The degree of portal fibrosis as determined on liver biopsy, graded according to the&#xD;
             Knodell score-modified by Ishak 71 must be less than or equal to 5 out of a possible&#xD;
             score of 6, 6 indicating cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The alcoholic hepatitis must be &quot;stable&quot;, i.e. not requiring treatment by either&#xD;
             pentoxifylline 72 or prednisone, with a Maddrey Score 73 {(PTpatient - PTcontrol) x&#xD;
             4.6 + TBmg/dL} &lt; 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be willing to participate in the trial, remain abstinent to alcohol, and&#xD;
             compliant to the treatment regimen, and undergo a post-treatment liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have either compensated cirrhosis (biopsy proven) or a clinical picture&#xD;
             of severe cirrhosis defined as Child's class C and/or with a recent history (within&#xD;
             one month) of decompensated liver disease (history of ascites, encephalopathy or&#xD;
             variceal bleeding within one month of trial entry). These patients have reduced life&#xD;
             expectancy below one year and are most often severely coagulopathic and cannot be&#xD;
             biopsied.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have severe acute alcoholic hepatitis of poor prognosis defined as a&#xD;
             Maddrey Score &gt; 32. These patients have a mortality rate of 50% during their&#xD;
             hospitalization period when untreated by either prednisone or pentoxifylline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving hepatotropic treatments such as colchicine, penicillamine,&#xD;
             corticosteroids, ursodeoxycholic acid, and pentoxifylline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving known hepatotoxic long-term treatments such as NSAIDs,&#xD;
             statins, neuroleptics, certain anti-convulsive medications, or high-dose&#xD;
             acetaminophen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients suspected of having hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have contra-indications to liver biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have a liver biopsy that does not yield sufficient specimen for analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have untreated deficiencies of folic acid, vitamin B6 or B12.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have chronic active Hepatitis B or C, hemochromatosis, autoimmune&#xD;
             hepatitis, or a cholangiopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychotic disorders, and in particular manic depression (contra&#xD;
             indication to SAMe treatment).&#xD;
