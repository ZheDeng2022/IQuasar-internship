      Hypothesis 1. Telepsychiatry consultations will be acceptable and well-received by depressed&#xD;
      Chinese Americans and by their primary care clinicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2. Depressed Chinese Americans in remote primary care clinics receiving T-CSCT&#xD;
      will have improved outcomes compared to patients who receive Usual Care by primary care&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;

      Telepsychiatry-based CSCT (T-CSCT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Live and interactive Telepsychiatry (using videoconferencing) brings tremendous opportunities&#xD;
      to clinical care, education, research, and administration. In the U.S. to date,&#xD;
      telepsychiatry has been implemented in rural areas where people lack access to psychiatrists&#xD;
      (Baer et al, 1997), in the Prison System with service users constrained from traveling&#xD;
      (Brecht et al., 1996), in rural native American resettlement areas (Shore &amp; Spero, 2005), and&#xD;
      in Alaska where residents are faced with both distance and a shortage of mental health&#xD;
      professionals. In this proposed study, we plan to investigate the effectiveness of&#xD;
      telepsychiatry-based CSCT (T-CSCT) to provide culturally sensitive collaborative management&#xD;
      of MDD to monolingual Chinese Americans. For this group of patients, telepsychiatry&#xD;
      consultation could be a necessity both in urban as well as rural primary care clinics that&#xD;
      are not staffed with bilingual psychiatrists. T-CSCT plans to utilize the advanced&#xD;
      telemedicine technology in major academic centers to connect the scarce resource of bilingual&#xD;
      and bicultural mental health professionals to underserved Chinese Americans to improve their&#xD;
      access to treatment of MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-CSCT will explore the usefulness and effectiveness of recognizing MDD subjects through&#xD;
      consumer-initiated depression self-screening using the validated CB-PHQ-9, which will be made&#xD;
      available in community newspapers, journals, and on the internet. To facilitate care&#xD;
      management for Chinese Americans, a Depression Toolkit for Chinese Americans will be&#xD;
      developed, which will include information on the nature and treatment of MDD, the CB-PHQ-9&#xD;
      for depression self-screening, a bilingual instrument to monitor progress of depressive&#xD;
      symptoms, strategies for patients to negotiate with health professionals for individually&#xD;
      tailored treatment for depression, and answers to frequently asked questions (FAQs) by Asian&#xD;
      American immigrants on MDD and its treatment. If shown to be effective, the T-CSCT can be the&#xD;
      prototype of a telemedicine-based Multiracial Mental Health Resource Center to provide&#xD;
      services to other minority populations to reduce disparities in mental health treatment.&#xD;
