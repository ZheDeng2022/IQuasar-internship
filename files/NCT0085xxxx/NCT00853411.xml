  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a clinical syndrome that is well recognized by health care practitioners, yet&#xD;
      asthma pathogenesis still remains poorly understood. Asthma affects approximately 20 million&#xD;
      Americans, who suffer around 5,000 deaths annually. More than 70% of people with asthma also&#xD;
      suffer from allergies. Although many advances in understanding the pathophysiology of asthma&#xD;
      have been made in the past few decades, more studies are necessary to achieve a more thorough&#xD;
      understanding of asthma at the cellular and molecular level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of murine models suggest asthma and &quot;allergic&quot; responses involve activation of&#xD;
      Th2 cytokine pathways, including IL-4 and -13. Similarly in humans, several lines of evidence&#xD;
      support a large role for Th2 adaptive immunity. These include the large majority of asthmatic&#xD;
      patients with atopy; the measurement of increased amounts of Th2 cytokines, including IL-4&#xD;
      and IL-13 in the airways and sputum of mild asthma; and most recently, the observed efficacy&#xD;
      of anti-IgE therapy in &quot;allergic&quot; asthma. However, other data, including the large numbers of&#xD;
      subjects with atopy and no asthma, suggest Th2 adaptive responses are insufficient to explain&#xD;
      many aspects of asthma. Whether and how innate and adaptive immune pathways interact in human&#xD;
      asthma is not clear, with few studies beginning to address these interactions in vitro and in&#xD;
      vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, the investigators of this study would like to prospectively enroll patients&#xD;
      with known asthma and follow them through an asthma exacerbation, while treating them with a&#xD;
      standardized protocol. Over six week's duration, the investigators would like to study&#xD;
      patients by collecting physiologic data such as spirometry, and biologic material in the form&#xD;
      of sputum, nasal scraping, venous blood, exhaled breath and sputum. It is our aim to fully&#xD;
      characterize the impact of the prostaglandin/cycloygenase/eicosanoid pathway as it relates to&#xD;
      asthma exacerbation and recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Completion of this study in human asthma may provide new mechanistic insights into how&#xD;
      relationships between innate and adaptive immune responses influence the course of an asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation. The information obtained from this research and the corresponding studies may&#xD;
      lead to innovative medical therapies and insight into the role of the epithelium and its&#xD;
      interactions with both innate and adaptive immunity.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All adults (age 18 and older) with moderate-severe persistent asthma identified by&#xD;
             their physicians at the Comprehensive Lung Center and UPMC network physicians, and&#xD;
             those individuals self-referred to the asthma research center will be considered for&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All subjects will be involved in the research design first by participating in&#xD;
             clinical testing to characterize the absence of any respiratory disease and the&#xD;
             severity of asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical testing will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  spirometry&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  methacholine challenge (when necessary for diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  allergy testing&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  nitric oxide monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  These tests will be performed as part of the research design on all adult subjects&#xD;
