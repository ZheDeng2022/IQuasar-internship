      Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) (excluding nasopharyngeal cancer) accounts for&#xD;
      4% to 5% of the cancer incidence in Taiwan.1 Localized disease is curable by surgery and&#xD;
      irradiation. Two-thirds of patients present with advanced stages of the disease (stage III&#xD;
      and IV), and are treated with multimodality therapy, including surgery, radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Despite the achievement of complete responses in patients who receive&#xD;
      multimodality therapy, however, recurrences might occur in some of patients within two years&#xD;
      after multimodality therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HNSCC has been regarded as a chemosensitive tumor since the early 1980s.Cisplatin-based&#xD;
      combination therapy with fluorouracil (5-FU) is the most common chemotherapy regimen for&#xD;
      patients with HNSCC. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is conceptually supported by the&#xD;
      natural history of head and neck cancer, which indicates a primary need to improve&#xD;
      locoregional therapy and only a secondary need to improve systemic therapy. CCRT has&#xD;
      frequently been studied in inoperable patients or in those with unresectable disease4.&#xD;
      Several recent studies and meta-analyses have indicated superior locoregional control and/or&#xD;
      survival rates after CCRT when compared with radiotherapy alone3-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Two similar, large-scale, prospective randomized independent trials designed by the European&#xD;
      Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and the Radiation Therapy Oncology&#xD;
      Group (RTOG) were conducted to evaluate the role of concurrent administration of cisplatin&#xD;
      with radiation in the postoperative treatment of high-risk head and neck tumors. The EORTC&#xD;
      (#22931) 29 study revealed that combination therapy was more efficacious than radiotherapy&#xD;
      alone in patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer and that the treatment did not&#xD;
      cause an undue number of late complications. The RTOG (#9501)30 trial found that&#xD;
      postoperative CCRT significantly improved the rates of local and regional control and&#xD;
      disease-free survival in high-risk patients with resected head and neck cancer; however, the&#xD;
      combined treatment was associated with a substantial increase in adverse effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multimodality therapy may achieve higher complete response rate for patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced HNSCC, however, patients still face high recurrent rate that might decrease survival&#xD;
      time. For these reasons, the development of reliable methods (for example) and metronomic&#xD;
      therapy to prevent relapse at locally advanced setting may improve the outcome of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uracil-tegafur (UFT), an oral fluoropyrimidine prodrug, is available commercially in Japan&#xD;
      and in several other countries. It is composed of 1-(2-tetrahydrofuryl)-5-fluorouracil (5-FU)&#xD;
      (FT; also ftorafur or tegafur) and uracil in a molar ratio of 1:4. FT is readily absorbed&#xD;
      through the gut without degradation and is converted in the liver to 5-FU and subsequently&#xD;
      degraded to 2-fluoro-b-alanine. Thus, UFT shares the chemotherapeutic mechanism of action of&#xD;
      5-FU. The 5-FU metabolite FdUMP binds and inhibits the enzymatic activity of thymidylate&#xD;
      synthase (TS), thereby inhibiting DNA synthesis.13-17 Uracil strongly inhibits the&#xD;
      degradation of 5-FU to 2-fluoro-b-alanine by competitive inhibition of dihydropyrimidine&#xD;
      dehydrogenase (DPD), the rate-limiting enzyme in the metabolism of 5-FU.18,19 This alteration&#xD;
      of 5-FU disposition seems to be tumor selective. When taken orally, UFT and FT give a&#xD;
      comparable distribution of 5-FU in blood and other normal tissues, but UFT results in 5-10&#xD;
      times greater distribution of 5-FU in tumors.20 Co-administration of uracil and/or FT,&#xD;
      therefore, enhances the anti-tumor activity of FT.21 The cytotoxic effects of 5-FU (and,&#xD;
      thus, FT) can be enhanced markedly if sufficient amounts of reduced folate cofactor, such as&#xD;
      leucovorin (LV), are present. Cellular folate pools are considered an important biochemical&#xD;
      determinant of FdUMP enzyme binding.22-28 One basic study has shown that in mice bearing&#xD;
      RENCA tumors, tegafur/uracil treatment resulted in significant prolongation of their life&#xD;
      span, which was associated with the inhibition of angiogenesis. This should be recomposed.&#xD;
      For example, &quot;Tegafur/uracil treatment of mice with RENCA tumors has been shown to inhibit&#xD;
      angiogenesis, leading to a significant prolongation of life span.Two metabolites of&#xD;
      tegafur/uracil, namely, GHB33,34 and GBL were found to be responsible for these effects. In&#xD;
      another study, the formation of cancer vasculature, essential for the initiation of&#xD;
      metastasis and the inhibition of tumor angiogenesis, is one of the targets in tumor dormancy&#xD;
      therapy. The efficacy of tegafur/uracil in postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in several clinical trials. The basic data from these studies indicate a&#xD;
      possible contribution of the anti-angiogenic activity of tegafur/uracil to its overall&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity, which until now has been thought to be mediated by the cytotoxic effects&#xD;
      of 5-FU. Thus, tegafur/uracil seems to be particularly useful in a chronic postoperative&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy regimen to control metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lam et31al. conducted a prospective randomized study of post-operative chemotherapy with&#xD;
      levamisole and UFT for treatment of head and neck carcinoma. A trend towards better distant&#xD;
      control in post-operative oral chemotherapy was observed. The side effects were minimal.&#xD;
      Masato Fujii also reported that adjuvant chemotherapy with UFT was efficacious for treating&#xD;
      maxillary sinus carcinoma. The 5-year survival was 76.2% for the UFT group and 17.9% for the&#xD;
      control group32.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metronomic chemotherapy refers to the close, regular administration of a chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      drug, over prolonged periods, with no extended drug-free break periods38. As such, it is a&#xD;
      form of &quot;dose dense&quot; chemotherapy but differs from most forms of the latter in several&#xD;
      ways35,36. First, it is not &quot;dose intense&quot; when the goal remains to deliver high, toxic&#xD;
      levels of drug over shorter periods of time. Second, because metronomic regimens are much&#xD;
      less toxic, they do not usually require supportive growth factor, or other supportive care&#xD;
      measures39,40. Metronomic chemotherapy can thus be viewed as a form of efficiently, low dose,&#xD;
      and long term 'maintenance' chemotherapy that can be used on its own36,38, or more&#xD;
      importantly, combined with long-term biologic targeted therapies, especially with&#xD;
      antiangiogenic drugs such as anti-VEGFR-2 antibodies41 or small molecule multi-targeted&#xD;
      VEGFR-2 antagonist receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitors42. It can also be integrated with&#xD;
      standard MTD-type (maximum tolerated dose) chemotherapy where brief courses of such therapy,&#xD;
      'upfront', is followed by long-term maintenance metronomic chemotherapy combined with&#xD;
      concurrent targeted therapies41,42, called &quot;chemo-switching&quot;40. The advantages of metronomic&#xD;
      chemotherapy include reduced acute toxicities, such as high grade myelosuppression, vomiting,&#xD;
      nausea, and mucotitis, 39,40 and sometimes surprisingly good activity against drug resistant&#xD;
      tumors38, reduced costs when using off patent chemotherapeutic drugs, and increased&#xD;
      convenience when using oral drugs that can be taken at home36,39. These potential advantages&#xD;
      could be useful for long term adjuvant therapy of early stage cancers, e.g. long-term daily&#xD;
      oral administration of a drug such as UFUR(UFT; a 5-FU prodrug) for 1~2 years with no&#xD;
      breaks43,45,46,50.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reason why standard chemotherapy, using a maximum tolerated dose (MTD), separated by long&#xD;
      2-3 week drug-free break periods is not as effective as an antiangiogenic treatment regimen&#xD;
      is that the damage inflicted upon the dividing endothelium cells of the tumor is largely&#xD;
      reversed during the extended drug-free break periods, perhaps by a massive hemopoiesis-like&#xD;
      mobilization ('rebound') of CEPs which then home to damaged tumor endothelium and set about&#xD;
      repairing the damage44. Thus shortening the break periods is critical to ensure that the&#xD;
      repair process is prevented or minimized38. This in turn requires relatively low doses of&#xD;
      drug to be used38.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The anti-tumor effects of single versus two chemotherapeutic drug combinations, dosed and&#xD;
      administered in a metronomic fashion, i.e., daily (by oral delivery) in a model of advanced&#xD;
      high volume (end stage) visceral metastatic disease where therapy is initiated in terminal&#xD;
      stages of disease47.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metronomic chemotherapy regimens combined with an antiangiogenic drug have moved into phase&#xD;
      II clinical trial testing both in the adjuvant and metastatic settings. Some interim results&#xD;
      of phase II clinical trials involving metastatic breast cancer or advanced, recurrent ovarian&#xD;
      cancer looked extremely promising48,49,50. Ongoing, planned or recently completed phase II&#xD;
      clinical trials of metronomic chemotherapy combined with an agent such as bevacizumab or&#xD;
      thalidomide should indicate whether or not this treatment strategy is promising in the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic and/or early stage human cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although when low-dose cytotoxic drugs combined with targeted agents may have potential&#xD;
      benefits as explained previously. There remain several significant challenges that must be&#xD;
      overcome to increase the success in the clinical setting. Foremost among these is the current&#xD;
      empiricism associated with trying to determine the optimal dose and schedule for&#xD;
      administration of chemotherapeutics. The challenge lies in finding the smallest dose that&#xD;
      will control the growth of target cells and then the most frequent dosing that will maximize&#xD;
      this control. the discovery and application of functional surrogate markers might be one of&#xD;
      the solutions to overcome the problem of metronomic-dose determination, such as determining&#xD;
      the So, detecting changes in levels of circulating TSP1 levels in serum or plasma after&#xD;
      administration of various low doses of chemotherapeutics might be useful in determining the&#xD;
      optimal low dose for a drug such as cyclophosphamide51.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to TSP1 level, the most important approach in determining the optimal metronomic&#xD;
      low dose for a given metronomic chemotherapy regimen is evaluation of the activities of CEPs&#xD;
      or circulating endothelial cells (CECs). As previously discussed, CEPs mobilization from the&#xD;
      bone marrow into the peripheral circulation is strongly inhibited by low-dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, as is CEP viability52. It might be conferred that there could be a direct&#xD;
      relationship between the relative efficacy of different (low) doses of metronomic&#xD;
      chemotherapy and the ability of these doses to reduce levels of CEPs in the peripheral&#xD;
      circulation. In a study by Shaked et al., using 4 distinct metronomic chemotherapy regimens&#xD;
      in 4 different preclinical tumor models to establish optimal biological dose (OBD) without&#xD;
      causing excessive toxicity demonstrated that the OBDs in each tumor models were strikingly&#xD;
      correlated with the maximum reduction in CEPs53. The results of this study suggested that&#xD;
      these results suggested that CEPs may serve as a pharmacodynamic biomarker to determine the&#xD;
      OBD of metronomic chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our understanding that the combination of clinical trial with laboratory&#xD;
      cellular/molecular assay is relevant to the current promising mainstream, the translational&#xD;
      research. The design of this trial fulfills this concept and would be a good example&#xD;
      conducting in Mackay Memorial hospital.&#xD;
