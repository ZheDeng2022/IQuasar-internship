    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of monochromatic&#xD;
      phototherapy (Biolight®) on foot ulcers in diabetic patients, in comparison of placebo&#xD;
      phototherapy as a complementary to standard diabetic foot ulcer therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study initiated with a four week long Run In Period to eliminate spontaneous healing&#xD;
      ulcer to be included. Treatment with monochromatic phototherapy (Biolight® or placebo) will&#xD;
      be given locally, additional to standard care, three times weekly during the first four weeks&#xD;
      and twice weekly the following sixteen weeks or until the ulcer is completely healed,&#xD;
      according to a pre-determined treatment plan. The area of the ulcer will be measured once&#xD;
      weekly for 20 weeks or until the ulcer is completely healed.&#xD;

      Description of Biolight® Therapy and device The therapy works by applying, for each&#xD;
      indication, a specific combination of pulsating monochromatic light to specific areas of the&#xD;
      body. The therapy is non-invasive, non-thermal, and based on the effects of pulsed&#xD;
      monochromatic light in the visible or near-visible spectrum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biolight® Therapy - mechanism of action Light is a pre-requisite for most living&#xD;
      organisms, and human being have learnt to use light in many different situations, not least&#xD;
      in health care, where light is widely used in various therapeutic contexts every day. X-ray&#xD;
      is used as an investigational tool. In treating skin diseases, such as psoriasis, we use UV&#xD;
      radiation. Laser has been successful, both in surgery and for pain relief, and white light&#xD;
      treatment is recommended in seasonal depressions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light is in fact electromagnetic radiation using various wavelengths. These wavelengths are&#xD;
      perceived as different colours. Red and violet light consist of long and shorter wavelength&#xD;
      respectively. Light consisting of all the wavelengths is perceived as white. There is an&#xD;
      electromagnetic field in light containing energy, which can be used in different treatment&#xD;
      situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the healing process of wounded tissue basal components need access to energy and oxygen.&#xD;
      If the amount of energy is insufficient, the healing process is retarded. By the use of&#xD;
      monochromatic light, having a predetermined energy level and a specific wavelength, we can&#xD;
      contribute to the expected amount of energy demand. Applied at a chosen pulse frequency and&#xD;
      for a carefully calculated period of time, the wounded cells are provided with energy,&#xD;
      increasing their activity as well as the oxygen supply in the damaged area. That may promote&#xD;
      a faster healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biolight Therapy is suggested to shorten treatment time and reduce treatment costs and to&#xD;
      improve quality of life. This non-invasive treatment is thought to be complementary to&#xD;
      traditional therapies. The method is simple, painless and without known side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Biolight Care Device The Biolight® Care Device is a CE-marked medical device certified in&#xD;
      accordance with the Medical Device Directive (MDD; 93/42/EEC), with the size of the palm of&#xD;
      the hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device contains 30 diodes emitting infrared light at 956 nm and also 80 diodes emitting&#xD;
      red light at 637 nm. Infrared and red pulsed monochromatic light are used in a unique&#xD;
      triple-stepped sequence. Infrared light, with an irradiance of ~55 W/m2, is combined with red&#xD;
      light, with an irradiance of ~21 W/m2. Using a duty cycle of 80%, both infrared and red light&#xD;
      are pulsed at the following frequencies during the first week: infrared/red 78 Hz,&#xD;
      infrared/red 702 Hz, infrared/red 8572,2Hz and from the second week: infrared/red 15,6 Hz,&#xD;
      infrared/red 287 Hz, infrared/red124 Hz. The choice of pulse frequencies and wavelengths are&#xD;
      based on earlier observations in both in-vitro and in-vivo studies. The equipment for both&#xD;
      monochromatic phototherapy and placebo (no irradiance output from the diodes) is identical in&#xD;
      appearance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies - light therapy Treatment with pulsed electromagnetic fields for 40 minutes&#xD;
      improves micro vascular perfusion of the skin (1). In a literature overview from 1965 to 2003&#xD;
      on low-laser therapy for wound healing, focusing on both in vitro models and in vivo animal&#xD;
      and human studies, some studies reported increased cell proliferation and collagen&#xD;
      production; improvements in surgical wound healing were found in a rodent model; and, in&#xD;
      humans, beneficial effects on superficial wound healing found in small case series have not&#xD;
      been replicated in larger studies (2). In none of the reviewed studies was the exact&#xD;
      mechanism of photo thermal, photochemical or photomechanical action, reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The precise mode of action of low-laser therapy on wound healing is still unknown (2). In a&#xD;
      meta-analytic study of 34 peer-reviewed papers on the efficacy of low-power lasers in tissue&#xD;
      repair, a positive effect was shown on collagen formation, rate of healing, tensile strength,&#xD;
      and time needed for wound closure (3). In an experimental study on pressure ulcers in mice, a&#xD;
      significant positive effect was shown on wound healing after treatment with low-laser therapy&#xD;
      and this effect was independent of the temperature on the skin surface (4). In a systematic&#xD;
      review of the effects of low-level laser therapy on wound healing in cell studies and animal&#xD;
      model experiments by Lucas et al. (5), the 36 included studies contained 49 outcome&#xD;
      parameters, of which 30 reported the positive effect of laser irradiation and 19 did not. The&#xD;
      methodological quality of many studies was poor, and in-depth analysis of the studies with&#xD;
      the highest methodological quality scores showed no significant pooled effect in favour of&#xD;
      treatment (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study of 20 spinal cord-injured patients with 22 pressure ulcers showed faster healing with&#xD;
      a combination of ultrasound/ultraviolet-C and laser treatment, compared with nursing care&#xD;
      alone (6). In a prospective, observer-blinded, multicenter randomized clinical study on the&#xD;
      efficacy of low-level laser therapy in 86 patients with stage III decubitus ulcers, no&#xD;
      evidence was found that justified the use of low-level laser therapy (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies - Biolight® A double-blind randomized placebo-controlled study on pressure&#xD;
      ulcer in elderly patients showed a statistically significant difference between patients&#xD;
      treated with monochromatic pulsating light (Biolight®) or placebo together with standard&#xD;
      care. This study was conducted on 163 patients as a multi-centre study at 9 centres in Sweden&#xD;
      and Denmark (8, 9). The mean normalised reduction in pressure ulcer size at week 12 was 0.79&#xD;
      for the phototherapy group and 0.50 for the placebo group (95 % CI 0.01-0.53; p=0.039). No&#xD;
      serious side effects were noted. The conclusion was that monochromatic pulsating light&#xD;
      fastened healing in grade II pressure ulcers in elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sub group analysis for the patient with diabetic foot ulcer in the above study showed a&#xD;
      strong tendency to improved healing (diff 71.3%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A controlled, randomised, open study on the effect of Biolight® phototherapy in comparison to&#xD;
      conventional treatment in 74 patients with grade II or III chronic pressure ulcers was&#xD;
      conducted at Huddinge hospital (10). This study showed a statistically significant decreased&#xD;
      time to healing, in the phototherapy treated group compared with the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical study of 26 elderly patients with decubitus ulcers showed that monochromatic&#xD;
      phototherapy, Biolight®, had an effect on the microcirculation in the edge of the decubitus&#xD;
      ulcer with an increase of the oxygen supply to the tissue. (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two in-vitro studies on the growth of skin fibroblast cells, using monochromatic phototherapy&#xD;
      showed that the two wavelengths and the low and high pulse frequencies used in the Biolight®&#xD;
      Wound Care program significantly influenced skin fibroblast cell growth (personal&#xD;
      communication Kratz &amp; Huss Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an animal study (exposure 5 times a week during a 2-week period), with similar equipment&#xD;
      and similar infrared and red light exposure as in the present study, no adverse effect was&#xD;
      found (11).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Diabetic patients with foot ulcers will be randomised to active&#xD;
      phototherapeutic treatment plus standard care treatment or placebo phototherapeutic treatment&#xD;
      plus standard care for diabetic foot ulcers.&#xD;
