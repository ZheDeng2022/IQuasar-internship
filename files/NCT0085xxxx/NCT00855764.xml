&#xD;
          -  Patients with locally advanced head and neck cancer pretreated with surgery and/or&#xD;
             radiotherapy (plus or minus one chemotherapy regimen) and not suitable for further&#xD;
             radical local treatment or patients with distant metastases who may have received no&#xD;
