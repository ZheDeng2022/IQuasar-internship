  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this study is to determine whether variations in the perilipin, and&#xD;
      several other, genes would be a useful tool for physicians who are caring for morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients to guide therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main hypotheses to be tested is that sequence variations (polymorphisms) in the perilipin&#xD;
      gene and several other obesity-related genes are associated with resistance to weight loss&#xD;
      for obese individuals on energy restricted diets, potentially playing a role in the&#xD;
      development of obesity related complications.&#xD;

      The PRIMARY goal of this study is to investigate the association of perilipin gene&#xD;
      polymorphisms, with obese subjects who are &quot;resistant&quot; to weight loss in a defined program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SECONDARY goal of this study is to investigate if additional candidate obesity genes that&#xD;
      have previously been associated with obesity or energy metabolism show association with&#xD;
      resistance to weight loss in subjects on an energy restricted diet. Additionally, we would&#xD;
      like to investigate if any metabolic syndrome parameters, such as dyslipidemia or abnormal&#xD;
      fasting glucose are associated with perilipin or variations in other obesity-related genes.&#xD;
