      Brigham and Women's Hospital will coordinate a Quality Improvement Initiative at other&#xD;
      hospitals that focuses on whether physician notification prior to discharge of high risk VTE&#xD;
      patients will reduce the incidence of VTE after hospital discharge.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND INFORMATION AND RATIONALE FOR THE STUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is often avoidable in hospitalized patients because proven&#xD;
      prevention strategies have been established for patients at risk (1). North American and&#xD;
      European prophylaxis guidelines have been widely disseminated. However, despite focus on&#xD;
      strategies for the prevention of VTE in hospitalized patients at the time of admission to the&#xD;
      hospital, there has been little focus on prevention of VTE at the time of discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital (2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Brigham and Women's Hospital, we undertook a previous Quality Improvement Initiative (BWH&#xD;
      protocol # 2000P000328) aimed at increasing the frequency of VTE prophylaxis in high risk&#xD;
      patients. This novel strategy required: 1) devising a risk score that reliably and quickly&#xD;
      identified patients at high risk of VTE, and 2) randomizing high-risk patients without&#xD;
      prophylaxis into an intervention group or control group. The intervention group's physicians&#xD;
      received a single electronic, computerized alert explaining that the patient was at high&#xD;
      risk, was not receiving prophylaxis, and suggesting that prophylaxis be ordered from a&#xD;
      template of available pharmacological and mechanical options. In contrast, the control&#xD;
      group's physicians received no alert (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each of 8 common risk factors was weighted according to a point scale. To be labeled as&#xD;
      &quot;high-risk&quot; for VTE, the point score must equal or exceed 4 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were 2,506 patients in the Quality Improvement Initiative: 1,255 in the intervention&#xD;
      group and 1,251 in the control group. The incidence of symptomatic VTE at 90 days was high:&#xD;
      8.2% in the control group and 4.9% in the intervention group (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, an investigator initiated Quality Improvement Initiative (BWH protocol #&#xD;
      2005-P-002527) of human alerts rather than electronic, computerized alerts, has been&#xD;
      undertaken in high risk patients not receiving prophylaxis. Enrollment of 2,500 patients at&#xD;
      25 centers located throughout the United States was completed in November 2007 with a&#xD;
      follow-up rate that exceeded 99%. Analysis of the data is currently being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Limited research focus has been placed on high-risk VTE subjects in the community, outside of&#xD;
      the hospital setting. Since most VTE prophylaxis has focused upon protection of high-risk&#xD;
      patients at the time of hospital admission, there is a need to focus on VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
      within 48 hours of hospital discharge. It is clear that as preparations are being made for&#xD;
      hospital discharge, many patients remain at high risk for DVT and acute pulmonary embolism.&#xD;
      After discharge, some patients will have an even higher risk than during hospitalization&#xD;
      because of prolonged immobilization and bed rest at home (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Discharge Alert Quality Improvement Initiative will determine whether alerting physicians&#xD;
      about the importance of continued VTE prophylaxis just prior to the time of planned hospital&#xD;
      discharge will lower the incidence of outpatient VTE. This new strategy is unproven and might&#xD;
      not be effective, but this Quality Improvement Initiative should provide a definitive answer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also implement as part of our Discharge Alert Trial an in-hospital Quality&#xD;
      Improvement Initiative of intensive patient education at Brigham and Women's Hospital to&#xD;
      improve patient adherence to physician-ordered pharmacological venous thromboembolism (VTE)&#xD;
      prophylaxis. We hypothesize that after implementation of this education program, fewer&#xD;
      patients will decline physician-ordered doses of enoxaparin or unfractionated heparin (UFH)&#xD;
      compared with a recent cohort of patients at risk for VTE who did not receive specialized&#xD;
      education about VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of Patients at Risk for Venous Thromboembolism (VTE)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hospitalized patients awaiting planned discharge within 48 hours will be evaluated with a&#xD;
      previously validated (BWH protocol # 2000P000328) VTE risk profile. The VTE risk profile will&#xD;
      be computed for each patient awaiting discharge using 8 common risk factors. Each risk factor&#xD;
      is weighted according to a point score. To be labeled as &quot;high risk&quot; for VTE, the point score&#xD;
      must equal or exceed 4 points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Minor (Low) Risk Factors (1 POINT each):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Advanced Age (&gt; 70 years of age)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obesity (BMI &gt; 29, or the presence of the word &quot;obesity&quot; in admission exam notes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bed rest / Immobility (not related to surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Female Hormone Replacement Therapy or Oral Contraceptives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intermediate Risk Factor (2 POINTS each):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Major Surgery (&gt; 60 minutes, during this admission)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major (High) Risk Factors (3 POINTS each):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer (active)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior VTE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypercoagulability&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening for Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the cumulative VTE risk score is at least 4, orders are reviewed to detect ongoing&#xD;
      mechanical or pharmacological prophylactic measures. Mechanical prophylactic measures include&#xD;
      graduated compression stockings and intermittent pneumatic compression devices.&#xD;
      Pharmacological prophylactic measures include unfractionated heparin, enoxaparin, dalteparin,&#xD;
      fondaparinux, tinzaparin, and warfarin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Brigham and Women's Hospital, we will also identify all new orders for pharmacological VTE&#xD;
      prophylaxis with enoxaparin and UFH using the BWH computerized order entry system as part of&#xD;
      an additional component of the Quality Improvement Initiative. For this component of the&#xD;
      Quality Improvement Initiative, eligibility is defined as having a DVT Risk Score of 3 or&#xD;
      higher and having electronically entered physician's orders for appropriate pharmacologic VTE&#xD;
      thromboprophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Improvement Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will take place within 48 hours of planned hospital discharge. If randomized&#xD;
      to the alert, the responsible physician will be notified that: 1) his or her patient is at&#xD;
      high risk for VTE, and 2) VTE prophylaxis should be considered in the Discharge orders. If&#xD;
      randomized to no alert (control patients), the responsible physician will not be contacted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Brigham and Women's Hospital, we will also provide 500 eligible patients in a prospective&#xD;
      cohort with one-on-one education using a scripted dialog to describe the rationale and&#xD;
      importance of pharmacological VTE prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylaxis Guidelines at Discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Consider Venous Thromboembolism prophylaxis at the time of hospital discharge in patients&#xD;
      with congestive heart failure or respiratory disease or prolonged immobility.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;For those without contraindication, consider pharmacological prophylaxis with low-molecular&#xD;
      weight heparin, unfractionated heparin, or fondaparinux.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;For those at high risk of bleeding, consider mechanical prophylaxis with intermittent&#xD;
      pneumatic compression devices or graduated compression stockings.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 90-day follow-up will be performed for all study patients. If patient outcomes cannot be&#xD;
      determined by medical record review alone, then study representatives may contact the&#xD;
      subject's Primary Care Physician (PCP) for necessary information. IRB approval must be&#xD;
      obtained at each participating hospital prior to any contact with subjects' PCPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Study Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is clinically diagnosed DVT or PE at 90 days. Safety endpoints include&#xD;
      total mortality and hemorrhagic events at 90 and 30 days, respectively. These are the same&#xD;
      endpoints utilized in our prior Quality Improvement Initiative (BWH protocol # 2000P000328).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemorrhagic events will be classified according to the Global Utilization of Streptokinase&#xD;
      and Tissue Plasminogen Activator for Occluded Coronary Arteries (GUSTO) trial criteria.&#xD;
      Bleeding events will be classified as severe or life-threatening if they are intracerebral or&#xD;
      if they result in substantial hemodynamic compromise requiring treatment. Moderate bleeding&#xD;
      is defined by the need for transfusion. Minor events refer to bleeding not requiring&#xD;
      transfusion or causing hemodynamic compromise. We will report rates of &quot;major bleeding&quot; which&#xD;
      will be defined as GUSTO severe/life-threatening or moderate bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the additional component of the Quality Improvement Initiative at Brigham and Women's&#xD;
      Hospital, we will also assess improvement of medication adherence with enoxaparin and UFH&#xD;
      following an intensive and individualized patient education program compared with our&#xD;
      recently completed cohort study in which no uniform education program was targeted at VTE&#xD;
      prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial sample size (power 80%, two-sided alpha 5%) has been calculated at 2,500 patients&#xD;
      based on an estimated 7% rate of the primary end point in the control group, and an odds&#xD;
      ratio of 0.59 for the primary endpoint in intervention group patients. This yields a sample&#xD;
      size requirement of 2,138 patients, plus an estimated 362 patients who will withdraw from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use Wilcoxon rank-sum tests for comparisons in the distributions of continuous&#xD;
      variables between groups, and chi-square tests or Fisher's exact test for comparisons of&#xD;
      categorical variables. The primary analysis is the difference in the Kaplan-Meier estimator&#xD;
      for freedom from VTE at day 90 between intervention and control patients. The log-rank test&#xD;
      will estimate the cumulative probability of the primary endpoint in the intervention and&#xD;
      control groups. We will use the proportional-hazards model for estimation of the relative&#xD;
      hazard of clinical endpoints associated with the physician alert. All p-values reported are&#xD;
      two-sided.&#xD;
