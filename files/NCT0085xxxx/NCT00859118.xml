  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to see what changes happen to the tumors while taking the&#xD;
      axitinib and after it is stopped (during the scheduled breaks), and what changes in the tumor&#xD;
      may be responsible for this growth. This will be done by using a special kind of scan called&#xD;
      an 18F-FLT PET/CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators want to find out how the drugs are processed and distributed&#xD;
      in the human body. The investigators will also look at how different types of cancer are&#xD;
      affected by axitinib. The investigators will also correlate vasculature kinetics extracted&#xD;
      from the dynamic FLT PET/CT imaging with the vasculature kinetics extracted from DCE-CT.&#xD;
