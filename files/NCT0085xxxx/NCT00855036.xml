    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the outcomes of children who have sustained blunt&#xD;
      renal injury and to evaluate our current bed rest protocol. The variables of concern are&#xD;
      readmission, operation, subsequent hypertension and clearance of hematuria. The specific aim&#xD;
      of the study is to prospectively collect the clinical data of these children to validate our&#xD;
      hospital management and to define the natural history of these lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current management for blunt renal injury in children is based on level 5 evidence, which&#xD;
      is the lowest score. Essentially, empiric decisions about therapy without physiologic&#xD;
      rationale have been permeated through generations of teaching. Patients are therefore managed&#xD;
      by historical opinion, borrowing some principles from spleen and liver injuries. Over the&#xD;
      past few decades all authors have agreed that non-operative management should be followed in&#xD;
      all these patients as almost all injuries will heal with preservation of renal function.&#xD;
      However, as opposed to spleen and liver injuries, there are no published guidelines for a&#xD;
      non-operative management scheme. The kidney possesses important anatomic and physiologic&#xD;
      differences when compared to the intraperitoneal solid organs that may allow for a distinct&#xD;
      method of management. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective review to examine the natural&#xD;
      history of these injuries and identify potential recommendations for management (IRB 07&#xD;
      12-186X). In patients with isolated renal injury (n = 65), mean length of bedrest was 3.8 +/-&#xD;
      1.9 days resulting in a mean length of stay of 3.8 +/- 3.1 days. There were no transfusions&#xD;
      in these patients. There were 3 patients readmitted after discharge, 2 for pain control, and&#xD;
      one for new hematuria after discharge. There were 15 patients discharged with persistent&#xD;
      hematuria, none of whom suffered long term sequelae. Children were released from bedrest in&#xD;
      attending-specific manner which was a wide array of management schemes. Our data suggests the&#xD;
      risk of significant hemorrhage from blunt renal trauma is low. Further, clearance of&#xD;
      hematuria may not be a good marker for therapy. Therefore, a period of bedrest with serial&#xD;
      blood and urine monitoring may not be justified, and there is clearly a role for prospective&#xD;
      application of a single management protocol to validate at least one protocol for other&#xD;
      institutions to follow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the retrospective data, we found one patient developed intermittent hypertension. However,&#xD;
      identifying this one patient requires that the hypertension is documented in our medical&#xD;
      record, which means we may miss those patients managed by their pediatricians. More&#xD;
      concerning is that we may be missing patients who have hypertension. These potential patients&#xD;
      may get well into adulthood before the hypertension is detected which is why this study is&#xD;
      imperative to define the natural history of renal healing, quantify the risk of hypertension,&#xD;
      and potentially identify predictors of this complication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The management protocol currently being followed and proposed for this study will include one&#xD;
      night of bedrest and then the patient may be ambulatory the next day. From this point,&#xD;
      patients will be managed in the hospital until they meet general discharge criteria.&#xD;
      Discharge criteria are adequate pain control with oral pain medications and tolerating&#xD;
      regular diet.&#xD;
