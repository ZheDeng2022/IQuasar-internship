      The objectives of this post-market evaluation are&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the capacity of the procedure to be completed with use of only a semi-rigid&#xD;
           ureteroscope, without requiring use of a flexible ureteroscope&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to compare the rate of retropulsion and the time required to complete the lithotripsy in&#xD;
           patients in which the Accordion device is used in contrast to when such a device is not&#xD;
           employed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In North America, ureteroscopic-guided lithotripsy with the holmium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet&#xD;
      (Ho:YAG) laser has increased in clinical utility owing to its capacity to fragment stones of&#xD;
      all compositions. However, with the application of the light energy, retropulsion of the&#xD;
      stone is possible due to the combined effects of fragment ejection, water vaporization, and&#xD;
      cavitation bubble expansion then collapse. Reducing the laser energy and using laser fibers&#xD;
      with small diameters are options to address such a consequence, but these changes have the&#xD;
      potential to reduce the efficacy of the laser treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Movement of stones and stone fragments during laser lithotripsy also can be caused by the&#xD;
      application of irrigation during the procedure. Irrigation is necessary in order to maintain&#xD;
      clear visualization of the targeted stone during lithotripsy, and yet irrigation flow&#xD;
      pressure can push stones away from the laser tip, requiring repositioning of the laser, and,&#xD;
      in the presence of hydrodilation of the ureter, cause the stone to float up to the renal&#xD;
      pelvis or into the kidney itself. In such a situation the physician may be required to use&#xD;
      more specialized instruments, adding to the complexity and cost of the procedure. As a&#xD;
      result, physicians monitor irrigation closely and will reduce the flow if retropulsion of the&#xD;
      stone or fragments occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retropulsion of stones and stone fragments during laser lithotripsy has been reported in up&#xD;
      to 24% of patients and can cause prolonged operative times due to near-constant repositioning&#xD;
      of the laser fiber between firings, and as well as result in additional treatment methods,&#xD;
      making available a flexible ureteroscope, with its associated costs, and additional cost&#xD;
      associated with an extended procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A novel occluding guidewire, the Accordion Stone Management Device, has been developed that&#xD;
      can be advanced up the ureter and past the stone. Once past the stone, an occlusion film is&#xD;
      engaged within the lumen of the ureter in order to limit retropulsion of the stone and its&#xD;
      fragments, irrespective of the laser energy, flow rate of irrigation, or dilation of the&#xD;
      ureter. Reduction of stone fragment movement has the potential to reduce operative time and&#xD;
      increase stone-free rates within this population.&#xD;
