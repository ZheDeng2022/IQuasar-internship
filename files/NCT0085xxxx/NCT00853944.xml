  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Islet transplantation requires a large number of islets required to achieve insulin&#xD;
      independence and the function of the transplanted islets progressively declines over time.&#xD;
      Evidence from animal studies and human islets in culture suggests that increasing GLP-1&#xD;
      levels could help with both of these problems. This study is designed to test this hypothesis&#xD;
      using sitagliptin in a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothesis: Sitagliptin taken for 12 months after an islet infusion will significantly&#xD;
      improve islet function compared with a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To determine if sitagliptin given at the time of an islet cell transplant (ICT)&#xD;
      results in improved islet graft function at 3 and 12 months post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective, randomized, double-blind, single-centre, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation for primary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome (stimulated insulin secretion) is a continuous variable that is normally&#xD;
      distributed. Our previous clamp studies show an expected standard deviation of around 20% and&#xD;
      we wish to be able to detect an increase of 33%. The result will be calculated both with and&#xD;
      without adjustment for the number of IE / kg that a patient has received, since the&#xD;
      literature is not clear on this issue. Analysis will be done using a two-sided t test. Sample&#xD;
      size is estimated using an approximation of Lehr's formula for 80% power and 2-sided&#xD;
      significance level of 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      m = 16 where d = δ δ = 33%, σ = 20% d 2 σ The calculation indicates a need for 6 patients per&#xD;
      arm or a total of 12 patients for the 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ability of our site to perform the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since starting in 2003, we have performed 75 islet infusions in 31 patients, averaging one&#xD;
      infusion per month. We are 1 of the 4 most active sites in North America (Edmonton, Miami,&#xD;
      Minnesota are the others). We have a list of patients activated and waiting for a suitable&#xD;
      islet donor. We anticipate that the great majority of patients will choose to participate in&#xD;
      this trial. We should easily be able to perform the required 12 islet infusions within 2&#xD;
      years. The advantage of performing this study in a single therapy is the ability to keep&#xD;
      constant variables such as eligibility criteria for recipients and choice of&#xD;
      immunosuppressive drugs that differ considerably between centres. This approach increases the&#xD;
      chances that the question posed will be answered by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients Eligible patients will be those in our transplant program who are about to&#xD;
      undergo an infusion of donor islets. Criteria for entry into our program are as described&#xD;
      (Warnock et al Arch Surg 2005;140:735). All eligible patients will be offered a chance to&#xD;
      enter the study. Patients will need to sign an informed consent that has been approved by the&#xD;
      Clinical Research Ethics Board of the University of British Columbia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding Random numbers will be computer generated and placed in opaque&#xD;
      sealed, numbered envelopes. The ratio of sitagliptin and placebo will be 1:1. The pharmacist&#xD;
      associated with the islet transplant team will be the only team member with knowledge of the&#xD;
      code for sitagliptin and placebo. Randomization will be done in blocks of four. The advantage&#xD;
      of block randomization is to allow similar distribution among groups of any changes in&#xD;
      performance of islet transplantation, such as new immunosuppression regimens, that could&#xD;
      arise during the course of the study. There will not be any stratification. Randomization&#xD;
      will be done just prior to islet infusion so that patients receiving either placebo or&#xD;
      sitagliptin will be given their medication before receiving islets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subject and the investigators obtaining consent, performing the transplant, providing&#xD;
      post-transplant care and performing the hyperglycemic clamp will be blind as to whether a&#xD;
      subject is receiving sitagliptin or placebo. The placebo will be supplied by Merck and will&#xD;
      be identical in appearance to sitagliptin. Sitagliptin and the placebo will be stored in the&#xD;
      VGH pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a subject consents to participate in the study, the investigator obtaining the consent&#xD;
      will contact the pharmacy. The pharmacy will open the next randomization envelope and&#xD;
      dispense the medication (sitagliptin or placebo). Ongoing supply of the medication will be&#xD;
      provided by the pharmacy in the transplant clinic during routine follow-up visits for&#xD;
      post-transplant care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Care&#xD;
&#xD;
      All aspects of the transplantation procedure, immunosuppressive therapy and ancillary care&#xD;
      will be performed as described (Warnock et al Arch Surg 2005;140:735) and will be similar for&#xD;
      all patients for the duration of the study. The indications for stopping or restarting&#xD;
      insulin are those recommended by the metabolic monitoring committee of the Collaborative&#xD;
      Islet Transplant Registry. This will eliminate subjective investigator judgments that could&#xD;
      affect one of the secondary endpoints (insulin dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Maximum insulin secretory capacity will be determined by a hyperglycemic glucose&#xD;
      clamp, performed as described (Al Ghofaili et al Transplantation 2007;83:24). This will be&#xD;
      performed at 3 and 12 months ± 2 weeks after islet infusion, with the subject having received&#xD;
      either sitagliptin or placebo during this period. The medication will be stopped for 48 hours&#xD;
      before the clamp to allow washout. A positive result would suggest that sitagliptin had&#xD;
      increased functional islet mass, not that it was acting as a short-term secretagogue. The&#xD;
      values will be expressed both as absolute numbers and as divided by the number of IE / kg&#xD;
      received as it is not clear from the literature which is the better measurement. A baseline&#xD;
      fasting C peptide will be drawn prior to the islet infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary: Patients are followed closely post transplant to maintain tight glucose control.&#xD;
      Insulin adjustment and glucose targets are as described. The average daily insulin&#xD;
      requirement in the week before transplant and in the week prior to stopping the study will be&#xD;
      used for calculation. A positive result would be consistent with either an increase in&#xD;
      functional islet mass or stimulation or insulin secretion.&#xD;
