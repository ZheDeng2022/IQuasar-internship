      Study phase: Phase II Investigational product, dosage, and route of administration:&#xD;
      Ibritumomab tiuxetan (&quot;Zevalin) is composed of a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (ibritumomab) covalently bound to the chelating agent tiuxetan. To prepare the active&#xD;
      therapeutic agent [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan, the antibody is chelated with the Î²-emitter&#xD;
      yttrium-90 chloride immediately before intravenous administration. Treatment with&#xD;
      [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan is preceded by an infusion of rituximab (Rituxan, Mabthera) in&#xD;
      order to optimize the biodistribution of radiolabeled antibody by depleting CD20 positive&#xD;
      B-cells. Rituximab is a chimeric human/murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody. The Zevalin study&#xD;
      regimen is given as an infusion of rituximab 250 mg/m2 and (where biodistribution imaging or&#xD;
      dosimetry is compulsory) 185 MBq (5mCi) of [111In]-ibritumomab tiuxetan on Day 1 followed 7&#xD;
      to 9 days later by a single dose of 14.8 MBq/kg (0.4 mCi/kg) of [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan,&#xD;
      maximal dose of 1184 MBq (32 mCi), preceded by 250 mg/m2 of rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference product, dosage, and route of administration: Not applicable Indication: stage&#xD;
      II-IV diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patients after 4 cycles of CHOP21-Rituximab&#xD;
      (CHOP21-R) Study objectives: Evaluation of efficacy and safety of [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan,&#xD;
      as well as assessment of quality of life Patient population: Patients more than 60&#xD;
      years-of-age with DLBCL after 4 cycles of treatment with CHOP21-R Study design: Prospective,&#xD;
      multicenter, open-label study designed to treat patients with a sequential front-line&#xD;
      treatment represented by: 4 cycles CHOP21-R plus Zevalin Duration of treatment: Four months&#xD;
      for CHOP21-R and two treatment days one week apart followed by a 12-week safety period for&#xD;
      Zevalin Duration of study: Estimated duration of study is 18 months Methodology: Primary&#xD;
      efficacy parameter: Overall response rate and complete response rate. Secondary efficacy&#xD;
      parameters: Overall survival, disease-free survival, health-related quality of life. Safety&#xD;
      parameters: Vital signs, adverse events (AEs), hematology, blood chemistry, and&#xD;
      immunoglobulin levels Number of study centers: Planned total of 10 study centers in Italy&#xD;
      Total number of patients, statistical rationale provided: Expected total of approximately 55&#xD;
      patients. The final sample size is based on the number of events observed for the primary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoint as calculated in the sequential statistical model. Adverse events: AEs&#xD;
      observed, mentioned upon open questioning and/or spontaneously reported will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned start and end of recruitment: Start of recruitment: 19/12/2006. End of recruitment:&#xD;
      04/11/2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manufacturer(s) of the investigational /reference product(s): Ibritumomab tiuxetan is&#xD;
      manufactured by Biogen IDEC, San Diego, CA and Cambridge, MA, USA. The isotopes yttrium-90&#xD;
      will be provided by European suppliers. There is no reference product in this study.&#xD;
