      Study phase: Phase II Investigational product, dosage, and route of administration:&#xD;
      Ibritumomab tiuxetan (Zevalin) is composed of a murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody (ibritumomab)&#xD;
      covalently bound to the chelating agent tiuxetan. To prepare the active therapeutic agent&#xD;
      [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan, the antibody is chelated with the β-emitter yttrium-90 chloride&#xD;
      immediately before intravenous administration. Treatment with [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan is&#xD;
      preceded by an infusion of rituximab (Rituxan, Mabthera) in order to optimize the&#xD;
      biodistribution of radiolabeled antibody by depleting CD20 positive B-cells. Rituximab is a&#xD;
      chimeric human/murine IgG1 monoclonal antibody. The Zevalin study regimen is given as an&#xD;
      infusion of rituximab 250 mg/m2 and (where biodistribution imaging or dosimetry is&#xD;
      compulsory) 185 MBq (5mCi) of [111In]-ibritumomab tiuxetan on Day 1 followed 7 to 9 days&#xD;
      later by a single dose of 14.8 MBq/kg (0.4 mCi/kg) of [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan, maximal&#xD;
      dose of 1184 MBq (32 mCi), preceded by 250 mg/m2 of rituximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indication: stage II-IV follicular lymphoma (FL) grade I-II after 4 cycles of FMR Study&#xD;
      objectives: Evaluation of efficacy and safety of [90Y]-ibritumomab tiuxetan, as well as&#xD;
      assessment of quality of life Patient population: Patients with after 4 cycles of treatment&#xD;
      with FMR Study design: Prospective, multicenter, open-label study designed to treat patients&#xD;
      with a sequential front-line treatment represented by 4 cycles FMR plus Zevalin Duration of&#xD;
      treatment: Four months for FMR and two treatment days one week apart followed by a 12-week&#xD;
      safety period for Zevalin Duration of study: Estimated duration of study is 18 months Primary&#xD;
      efficacy parameter: Overall response rate and complete response rate Secondary efficacy&#xD;
      parameters: Overall survival, Disease-free survival, health-related quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters: Vital signs, adverse events (AEs), hematology, blood chemistry,and&#xD;
      immunoglobulin levels Number of study centers: 4 study centers in Italy T otal number of&#xD;
      patients, statistical rationale provided: Expected total of 55 patients. The final sample&#xD;
      size will be based on the number of events observed for the primary efficacy endpoint as&#xD;
      calculated in the sequential statistical model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events: AEs observed, mentioned upon open questioning and/or spontaneously reported&#xD;
      will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned start and end of recruitment: Start of recruitment: 3rd quarter 2006. End of&#xD;
      recruitment: 1st quarter of 2007&#xD;
