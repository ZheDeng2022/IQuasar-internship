  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to establish what dose level and dosing frequency is&#xD;
      optimal in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis patients with ART621.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite being effective in approximately 60% of subjects, there are limitations to existing&#xD;
      anti-TNF therapies especially in relation to immunogenicity, safety and administration. In&#xD;
      addition, due to their high molecular weight, currently marketed products are largely&#xD;
      confined to the blood stream.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ART621 is an anti-TNF molecule that contains 2 identical domain &quot;antibodies&quot; that have the&#xD;
      binding activity of a full antibody but with a substantially smaller molecular size. The&#xD;
      molecular weight of approximately half that of full size antibodies is predicted to, a) have&#xD;
      improved tissue penetration and, b) to be less immunogenic than full size antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical trial is designed to establish the optimal dose level and dose frequency of&#xD;
      ART621 in the treatment of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and to obtain data relating to&#xD;
      the safety, immunogenicity and pharmacokinetics of ART621 when administered with an&#xD;
      intravenous loading dose followed by subcutaneous administration every week compared to every&#xD;
      fortnight.&#xD;
