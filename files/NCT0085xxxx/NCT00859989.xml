      RATIONALE: A diet and physical activity program followed by a weight-loss maintenance program&#xD;
      may help obese black women lose weight. It is not yet known whether a weight-loss program is&#xD;
      more effective than a general health education program in helping obese black women lose&#xD;
      weight. Weight loss may reduce a person's risk of developing cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase III trial is studying a weight-loss program to see how well it&#xD;
      works in helping obese black women lose weight.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the effectiveness of a 24-week diet and physical activity intervention and a&#xD;
           1-year maintenance intervention designed to produce and maintain weight loss in obese&#xD;
           black women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the effect of these interventions on changes in fasting serum insulin,&#xD;
           glucose, and free IGF-1, IGFBP-1, and IGFBP-2 levels as well as total IGF-1 and IGFBP-3&#xD;
           levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare changes in dietary consumption of total calories, total fat, fruits,&#xD;
           vegetables, and fiber as well as physical activity in participants undergoing a&#xD;
           weight-loss intervention vs a control intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare changes in knowledge, attitudes, self-efficacy, and social support related to&#xD;
           diet, physical activity, and weight loss in participants undergoing a weight-loss&#xD;
           intervention vs a control intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the efficacy of a weight-loss intervention mechanism and the association between&#xD;
           weight loss and weight loss maintenance with potential biologic mediators of breast&#xD;
           cancer risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Participants are randomized to 1 of 2 intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (weight-loss intervention): Participants undergo a combined weight-loss&#xD;
           intervention (diet and physical activity) over 24 weeks comprising individualized&#xD;
           sessions with an interventionist once monthly and group sessions twice weekly. During&#xD;
           the group sessions, participants receive information about diet, physical activity, and&#xD;
           weight loss and take part in exercise classes. Participants receive handouts,&#xD;
           food-measuring tools, and pedometers. Participants also discuss goal setting and problem&#xD;
           solving. During the individualized sessions, participants undergo motivational&#xD;
           interviewing (MI) to assess their individual needs and to motivate them to make or&#xD;
           sustain behavioral changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beginning 1 month after completion of the combined weight-loss intervention, participants&#xD;
      undergo a weight-loss maintenance intervention over 12 months. Participants continue their&#xD;
      exercise classes twice weekly and receive a copy of the aerobic exercise class videotape for&#xD;
      use at home. Prior to each exercise session, participants may share their weight-loss&#xD;
      experiences (e.g., successes, struggles) or a motivational or informational story, article,&#xD;
      or prayer with other group members. Participants also receive weekly newsletters that include&#xD;
      information presented in the original weight-loss intervention, opportunities in the&#xD;
      community for physical activity (e.g., ice skating, swimming, or local walks), and further&#xD;
      advice on maintaining weight loss. Participants undergo 4 MI sessions over the telephone that&#xD;
      address diet, physical activity, and weight-loss maintenance strategies. The MI sessions also&#xD;
      provide an opportunity for individualized problem solving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (control intervention): Participants undergo a control intervention over 24 weeks&#xD;
           comprising weekly newsletters on general health topics, such as first aid, smoking&#xD;
           cessation, cancer screening, and disease prevention, and monthly general health classes&#xD;
           that demonstrate information conveyed in the newsletter (e.g., first-aid techniques).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the control intervention, participants undergo a control maintenance&#xD;
      intervention over 12 months comprising a monthly newsletter on general health topics. After&#xD;
      completion of the maintenance intervention, participants undergo 10 intervention sessions and&#xD;
      receive the same study-related materials (handouts, food-measuring tools, and pedometers) as&#xD;
      in arm I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected at baseline, 24 weeks, and 18 months for laboratory biomarker&#xD;
      studies. Samples are analyzed for insulin levels by radioimmunoassay, glucose concentrations,&#xD;
      and total and free IGF-1, IGFBP-1, IGFBP-2, and IGFBP-3 by enzyme-linked immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants complete questionnaires at baseline, 24 weeks, and 18 months to assess diet,&#xD;
      physical activity, cognitive measures (attitudes, beliefs, and self-efficacy), social&#xD;
      support, and environmental measures.&#xD;
