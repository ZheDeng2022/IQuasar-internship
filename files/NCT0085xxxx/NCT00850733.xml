        The study will recruit 260 patients nationwide with an expected recruitment of 6 patients&#xD;
        at the VA San Diego Healthcare System. Patients must be between 18-80 years of age and will&#xD;
        include patients with neurogenic detrusor overactivity as a result of spinal cord injury or&#xD;
        multiple sclerosis, with urinary incontinence, who have not been adequately managed with&#xD;
        anticholinergic therapy. 50% of the patients randomized will be of spinal cord injury&#xD;
        etiology and 50% of multiple sclerosis etiology.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Patient weighs ≥ 50 kg (110 lb).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient has urinary incontinence as a result of neurogenic detrusor overactivity for a&#xD;
             period of at least 3 months prior to screening as a result of spinal cord injury or&#xD;
             multiple sclerosis, determined by documented patient history. In addition:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Spinal cord injury patients must have a stable neurological injury level at T1 or&#xD;
                  below (cervical injuries are excluded) occurring ≥ 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Multiple sclerosis patients must be clinically stable in the investigator's&#xD;
                  opinion for ≥ 3 months prior to screening and have an Expanded Disability Status&#xD;
                  Scale score ≤ 6.5.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient has detrusor overactivity (defined as a phasic rise in bladder pressure during&#xD;
             the filling phase determined by urodynamics) demonstrated during the screening period&#xD;
             or Day 1 (prior to randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient is able to complete study requirements including bladder diary completion and&#xD;
             attend all study visits (telephone and clinic), in the opinion of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient has not been adequately managed with one or more anticholinergics for their&#xD;
             urinary incontinence, in the opinion of the investigator. Not adequately managed is&#xD;
             defined as an inadequate response or intolerable side effects after at least one month&#xD;
             of anticholinergic therapy on an optimized dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For patients taking anticholinergic medication for their neurogenic overactive&#xD;
             bladder, dose is stable and patient is willing to maintain same dosing during study&#xD;
             participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has a negative pregnancy result if female and of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The following criteria are also required for entry into the study at Randomization/Day&#xD;
             1:&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient experiences ≥ 14 episodes of urinary incontinence per week with no more than 2&#xD;
             incontinent-free days determined by completion of patient bladder diary during the&#xD;
             screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient currently uses or is willing to use clean intermittent catheterization (CIC)&#xD;
             to empty the bladder (indwelling catheter is not permitted). Patients currently on CIC&#xD;
             should be willing to maintain an established CIC frequency throughout the study.&#xD;
             Caregiver may perform CIC.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a negative urine culture result must take an antibiotic medication for 3&#xD;
             days immediately prior to Randomization/Day 1 and agree to continue antibiotic&#xD;
             medication for at least 3 days following treatment. Patients with a positive urine&#xD;
             culture result indicating urinary tract infection (UTI) must take an antibiotic to&#xD;
             which the identified organism is sensitive for at least 5 days immediately prior to&#xD;
             Randomization/Day 1 and continue for 3 days following the procedure (or longer as&#xD;
             needed) and patient is asymptomatic for UTI on day of treatment. A UTI is defined as&#xD;
             either a positive urine culture result with a bacteriuria count of &gt; 105 CFU/mL&#xD;
             conjoint with a leukocyturia &gt; 5/hpf at screening or a positive urine culture that, in&#xD;
             the investigator's opinion, requires antibiotic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient has history or evidence of any pelvic or urological abnormalities including&#xD;
             but not limited to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  elevated serum creatinine &gt; 2 times the upper limit of normal (reference range)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of or current hematuria, 1) if the hematuria is determined to be a&#xD;
                  pathologic condition or 2) is uninvestigated&#xD;

               -  bladder stones within 6 months of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  surgery or bladder disease other than detrusor overactivity that may impact&#xD;
                  bladder function with the exception of surgeries for bladder stones (&gt; 6 months)&#xD;
                  and stress incontinence, uterine prolapse, rectocele, or cystocele (&gt;1 year) from&#xD;
                  screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient has had previous or current botulinum toxin therapy of any serotype for any&#xD;
             urological condition or, treatment within 3 months of Randomization/Day 1 for any&#xD;

             exposure to BOTOX® including diagnosed myasthenia gravis, Eaton-Lambert syndrome or&#xD;
             amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient is female and pregnant, nursing or planning a pregnancy during the study, or&#xD;
             of childbearing potential and unable or unwilling to use a reliable form of&#xD;
             contraception during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Patient is currently or has previously participated in another therapeutic or device&#xD;
             study within 30 days of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patient has any condition or situation, which, in the investigator's opinion, puts the&#xD;
             patient at significant risk, could confound the study results, or may interfere&#xD;
