  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) can be a serious complication. The development of&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies for the prevention and treatment of this condition requires the&#xD;
      identification of subgroup of patients with the greatest incidence of POCD. Several&#xD;
      retrospective analyses have raised the possibility that surgery is a risk factor for the&#xD;
      accelerated progression of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Moreover, there is increasing evidence&#xD;
      that inflammatory mechanisms are involved in the pathogenesis of AD. Major surgery can be&#xD;
      associated with a profound systemic inflammatory response. Consequently, it is reasonable to&#xD;
      suggest that there is a link between major surgery and the postoperative development of AD in&#xD;
      patients who are already at high risk for this complication, e.g. the elderly with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment. In addition, there are several laboratory investigations that suggest&#xD;
      that anesthetic agents increase amyloid peptide levels as well as enhance oligomerization of&#xD;
      these proteins. The significance of these findings, however, is unknown. This clinical study&#xD;
      seeks to correlate perioperative inflammatory responses, perioperative changes in&#xD;
      amyloid-beta protein levels (markers of AD) with neurocognitive and functional outcome in the&#xD;
      elderly who are at risk for POCD. This knowledge does not exist, but is essential in the&#xD;
      effort to plan perioperative care that can reduce the incidence of POCD as well as improve&#xD;
      functional recovery.&#xD;

      We will recruit 50 patients 65 years and older scheduled for spine surgery. The design&#xD;
      utilizes prospective serial assessments. The enrolled 50 surgical subjects will be evaluated&#xD;
      preoperatively and postoperatively over 6 time-points (preoperatively, inta-op, post op day&#xD;
      1, post op day 7, three months and six months) using a widely accepted set of neurocognitive&#xD;
      tests, multiple indices of functional recovery, as well as blood tests for plasma biomarkers&#xD;
      of inflammation and β-amyloids. Enrollees will be divided in 2 groups: 25 patients with mild&#xD;
      cognitive impairment (diagnosed by clinical assessment) and 25 normal elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of normal elderly includes: 1). Global Deterioration Scale (GDS) &lt; 3 and&#xD;
      Mini-Mental Exam Score (MMSE) &gt;27; 2). Performance on neurocognitive testing (including&#xD;
      memory) that is within 1.5 Standard Deviation (SD) of the age matched normative data; 3). The&#xD;
      informant interview confirming no functional impairment in the subject. The definition of MCI&#xD;
      includes: self-reported memory and functional complains, a history of memory decline with&#xD;
      functional changes that are corroborated by a knowledgeable informant, and a clinical&#xD;
      interview resulting in a GDS=3 or higher and MMSE=26 or lower.&#xD;
