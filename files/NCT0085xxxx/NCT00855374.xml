      Thrombin is the most potent activator of platelets, and platelet activation is a hallmark of&#xD;
      thrombosis. Coronary artery disease (CAD) is the major cause of mortality and morbidity in&#xD;
      the United States and other industrialized countries, and thrombotic sequelae are the key&#xD;
      cause of death in diabetes. The accumulation of thrombin at sites of vascular injury provides&#xD;
      one of the major mechanisms of recruiting platelets into a hemostatic plug. Thrombin works by&#xD;
      activation of the G protein-coupled protease activated receptors PAR1 and PAR4 on human&#xD;
      platelets to initiate signaling cascades leading to increases in [Ca]i, secretion of&#xD;
      autocrine activators, trafficking of adhesion molecules to the plasma membrane, and shape&#xD;
      change, which all promote platelet aggregation. The thrombin receptors work in a progressive&#xD;
      manner, with PAR1 activated at low thrombin concentrations, and PAR4 recruited at higher&#xD;
      thrombin concentrations. As direct thrombin inhibitors become widely used in clinical&#xD;
      practice, it is important to assess their effects on vascular function. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that PAR1 and PAR4 do not signal through the same G protein pathways, and that PAR4 is not a&#xD;
      strong platelet agonist. To investigate this hypothesis, the investigators will study the G&#xD;
      protein pathways downstream of PAR4, and assess ex-vivo platelet responsiveness to thrombin,&#xD;
      PAR1, and PAR4 agonist peptides, both in normal human subjects, and along the stages of&#xD;
      pathology, from patients with stable angina as well as unstable angina who are undergoing&#xD;
      angioplasty. Similarly, the investigators will examine platelet function in patients with&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome as well as diabetes, along the continuum from insulin resistance to&#xD;
      full-blown disease. These studies will provide deeper insight into the G protein pathways&#xD;
      used by PARs. They will elucidate the contribution of PAR receptors to normal platelet&#xD;
      function as well as the abnormal platelet activation in thrombotic states. The long term goal&#xD;
      is to understand the implications for PAR receptors as therapeutic targets for anti-platelet&#xD;
      therapies that may carry less bleeding risk.&#xD;

      Given the known roles of proteases and PARs in coagulation, inflammation, pain, healing and&#xD;
      protection, the need for development of a PAR antagonist as a therapeutic agent for treatment&#xD;
      of thrombosis, atherosclerosis and inflammation is well-recognized. Thus, blocking PAR action&#xD;
      by inhibiting the PAR-G protein interface is an alternative target for blocking downstream&#xD;
      consequences of thrombin-mediated cellular activation. Since there are two PARs on human&#xD;
      platelets, PAR1 and PAR4, it is critical to define the roles of both receptors in several&#xD;
      likely clinical settings where PAR antagonists would be used. In this proposal both the G&#xD;
      protein pathways underlying PAR signaling mechanisms as well as their roles in pathologies&#xD;
      characterized by activated platelets will be studied in detail. We propose in our grant to&#xD;
      investigate the specific roles of individual PARs in mediating the events leading to the&#xD;
      multi-stage process of platelet activation and clot formation. The long term goals of these&#xD;
      studies are to determine novel PAR-specific anti-platelet therapies. The 2002 estimates of&#xD;
      the DHHS suggest that 6.3% of the population of the United States (18.2 Million people) have&#xD;
      diabetes, with estimated annual costs of $132 Billion (Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention). The complications of coronary artery and of cerebrovascular disease account for&#xD;
      up to 65% of deaths in patients with diabetes. The prevalence, complexity and complications&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease are increased in patients with diabetes. This appears related to&#xD;
      the frequent association of diabetes and of insulin resistance with traditional risk factors&#xD;
      for atherosclerosis. Recent studies by Haffner and other investigators have established the&#xD;
      concept of diabetes as a coronary risk equivalent; this is reflected in the guidelines for&#xD;
      therapeutic targets set by the ADA, AHA and ACC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical importance of platelet activation is reflected by the benefits of aspirin and&#xD;
      clopidogrel and GPIIbIIIa inhibitors in diabetics. Epidemiologic data demonstrates that the&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome is associated with an increased incidence of atherosclerotic events. Type&#xD;
      2 diabetes shares many features in common with the metabolic syndrome, and may represent a&#xD;
      precursor condition, Stern described this in the &quot;common soil hypothesis&quot;. Hsueh and Law have&#xD;
      more recently proposed that the progression of insulin resistance to type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      parallels the progression of endothelial dysfunction to atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These studies were designed to study PAR signaling and G protein activation states in&#xD;
      patients with platelet activation in the setting of the continuum of the metabolic syndrome&#xD;
      and diabetes mellitus. The degree of platelet activation as determined by assays of platelet&#xD;
      reactivity and by the expression of markers of platelet activation will be correlated with&#xD;
      the changes in PAR signaling. These studies will provide a comprehensive assessment of&#xD;
      platelet activation in the setting of the metabolic syndrome, and will compare the extent of&#xD;
      activation in this setting with that in a group of contemporaneously studied patients with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus. Finally, the influence of the direct thrombin inhibitor, bivalirudin on&#xD;
      platelet activation and signaling will be assessed.&#xD;
