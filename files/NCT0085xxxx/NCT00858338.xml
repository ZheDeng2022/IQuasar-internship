  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of addition of intraperitoneal (ip)&#xD;
      Floxuridine to adjuvant chemoradiation therapy for patients under-going potentially curative&#xD;
      stomach resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most patients diagnosed with stomach cancer in the US fail to be cured by gastric resection,&#xD;
      and most trials of adjuvant chemotherapy do not improve survival rates. However, it has shown&#xD;
      that chemo-radiotherapy can substantially increase survival rates after gastric resection in&#xD;
      a recent intergroup randomized study (INT 0116) that used adjuvant chemoradiation of&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and leucovorin concurrently with total dose of 4500 cGy of&#xD;
      external-beam radiation treatment (RT) to the abdominal tumor nodal field in patients with&#xD;
      resected, locally advanced gastric cancer. However, since the most common recurrences in both&#xD;
      arms (surgery only vs. surgery followed by chemoradiation) were regional, typically abdominal&#xD;
      carcinomatosis, this may indicate the need for adjuvant ip floxuridine to be added to&#xD;
      adjuvant chemoradiation. Our experience for ip floxuridine leads us to hypothesize that the&#xD;
      addition of this type of therapy to adjuvant chemoradiation may further increase the&#xD;
      cure-rate for patient under-going potentially curative gastric resection. It seems important&#xD;
      to convincingly demonstrate the effect of ip floxuridine treatment combined with the&#xD;
      chemoradiation regimen. This became the basis for the design of this Phase II study, which&#xD;
      will test the toxicity and efficacy of ip floxuridine added to chemo-radiation of the INT&#xD;
      0116 study. The protocol is to be completed in three years, and it may become a springboard&#xD;
      for planning and initiation of a pivotal multi-institutional trials.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Eligibility to the protocol is established following complete evaluation specified&#xD;
             under 9.2 of the study protocol. This evaluation includes the diagnosis and disease&#xD;
             stage. Untreated patients with histologically documented gastric/GEJ carcinoma stages&#xD;
             IB-IV (Mo), become eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who underwent emergency surgery for indications such as gastrointestinal&#xD;
             obstruction, perforation or hemorrhage, or patients with surgery already performed,&#xD;
             are eligible as long as the surgery is considered curative (Ro) as specified in&#xD;
             section 9.3 of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

             2.5x the upper limit of normal, BUN not greater than 30 mg/dL, creatinine&#xD;
             concentration not greater than 1.5 mg/dL or creatinine clearance &gt;60 mL/min), and&#xD;
             negative BHcG in females of reproductive potential, are required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have evidence of at least unilateral renal function as established by CT&#xD;
             scan with contrast or nephrogram. If only one kidney is present, at least two thirds&#xD;
             of the functioning kidney must be excluded from any radiation port.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The prothrombin time, activated partial thromboplastin time, and thrombin time should&#xD;
             be within the range of normal values.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients and records must be evaluated by a Surgical, Radiation and Medical&#xD;
             Oncologists within one month before their entry to this protocol. There should be a&#xD;
             reasonable assurance that patient will be available for planned post-treatment&#xD;
             follow-up.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with another active invasive malignancy. Adequately treated basal cell or&#xD;
             squamous cell skin cancer, in-situ cervix cancer, or other cancers the patient has&#xD;
             been free for at least 5 years, are acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active or uncontrolled infection including HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
