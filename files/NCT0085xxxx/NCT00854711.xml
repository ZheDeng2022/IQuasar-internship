    <textblock>
      Reperfusion of ischemic myocardium, termed ischemia/reperfusion during the treatment of MI&#xD;
      may result in paradoxical myocardial injury compromising myocardial salvage and left&#xD;
      ventricular functional recovery. Nitric oxide (NO) modulates many of the processes&#xD;
      contributing to ischemia-reperfusion injury (IR)and inhaled NO (iNO) has been shown to&#xD;
      decease infarct size in animal models of IR. iNO has been studied in various clinical&#xD;
      settings and has shown promise im modulating the detrimental effects of IR. Clinical toxicity&#xD;
      potentially associated with the use of iNO was of no apparent concern in these studies.&#xD;
      Although controlled trials of iNO therapy in humans with acute MI have not been published,&#xD;
      anecdotal experience indicates a beneficial impact of iNO on the hemodynamic course of&#xD;
      patients with right ventricular MI. iNO is widely used to treat neonatal hypoxemia and acute&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension. iNO has been studied at this dose in various clinical settings and&#xD;
      side effects related to its use at such doses are extremely uncommon. The effect of iNO on IR&#xD;
      injury in patients with acute ST-segment elevation MI is unknown. The investigator intend to&#xD;
      perform a prospective, randomized, placebo-controlled, clinical trial of iNO in patients with&#xD;
      acute MI undergoing primary percutaneous intervention to determine whether this form of&#xD;
      therapy can decrease infarct size and improve clinical outcomes.&#xD;

      Eligible consenting patients will be randomly assigned to either of the 2 treatment arms&#xD;
      using a computer-generated randomization sequence. Treatment arms: 1) Intervention group,&#xD;
      treated with inhalation of a mixture of NO 80 ppm and oxygen; or, 2) Control group,&#xD;
      inhalation oxygen and nitrogen (placebo). In both groups, oxygen will be administered at the&#xD;
      minimal FiO2 required to maintain arterial oxygen saturation determined by pulse oxymetry&#xD;
      &gt;97%. Inhalation treatment will be given throughout the angioplasty procedure via a reservoir&#xD;
      face mask and a dedicated respiratory circuit. Nitric oxide will be delivered using an&#xD;
      FDA-approved device marketed in Israel under license by the Ministry of Health. The device is&#xD;
      in routine clinical use in intensive care units, neonatal care units, and catheterization&#xD;
      laboratories. An NO-level detector will be employed in the catheterization laboratory to&#xD;
      monitor the ambient NO exposure of the staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival in the catheterization laboratory, a 40 ml blood sample will be obtained for a&#xD;
      full chemistry panel, lipid levels, complete blood count. Creatine kinase, creatine kinase MB&#xD;
      fraction, and troponin I will be measured at baseline and every 4 hours following the&#xD;
      angioplasty procedure during the first 24 hours, and then every 6 hours during the second and&#xD;
      third days, and as clinically indicated thereafter.Methemoglobin levels will be measured at&#xD;
      baseline, every 30 minutes throughout the interventional procedure, at procedure completion,&#xD;
      and at 4 hours post procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo diagnostic angiography and interventional procedures as per&#xD;
      standard clinical practice. Post procedural pharmacotherapy, sheath removal, and deployment&#xD;
      of hemostatic devices will be left to the discretion of the attending physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following treatment in the catheterization laboratory, medical treatment throughout&#xD;
      hospitalization and recommendations for therapy after discharge will be left to the&#xD;
      discretion of the attending cardiologists managing patient care on the hospital wards. These&#xD;
      cardiologists will be blinded to the patient randomization status.&#xD;
