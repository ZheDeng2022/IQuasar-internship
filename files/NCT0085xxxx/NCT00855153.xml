  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this pilot study is to begin the examination of the feasibility of using&#xD;
      Gradual Virtual Reality Exposure Therapy and D-Cycloserine (DCS) in the management of&#xD;
      posttraumatic psychological symptoms in burned OIF/OEF military combatants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of a feasibility study is to determine if there is clinical utility in this&#xD;
      proposed treatment and to establish effective and safe treatment procedures. Given current&#xD;
      literature, the following hypotheses are generated:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Virtual Reality Exposure and D-Cycloserine medication (VRE + DCS learning pill)&#xD;
      will result in clinically meaningful PTSD symptom reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. SMs will attain scores that are lower than initial measures for symptoms of PTSD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. By the completion of VRE, Ss will attain scores in the sub-clinical range for measures&#xD;
           of clinical depression Hypothesis 2: SMs will report greater life satisfaction following&#xD;
           completion of VR+DCS treatment, as measured by scores on the Quality of Life Inventory&#xD;
           (QOLI) when compared to pre-treatment scores&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to establish systematic observations about the feasibility of&#xD;
      using gradual exposure virtual reality treatment and D-Cycloserine (VRE + DCS) with service&#xD;
      members receiving medical care for burns attained during combat. The rational for this study&#xD;
      comes from the need to establish with this population, when and how VRE + DCS might be&#xD;
      delivered in a safe and systematic fashion. This would be done in preparation for the&#xD;
      potential of a future controlled study to address the efficacy of VRE + DCS in comparison to&#xD;
      each component and control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study seeks to establish methods of applying VRE + DCS in relation to medical viability&#xD;
      as an attempt to clarify at what stage of medical care a service member is able to give&#xD;
      informed consent, follow the proscribed instructions, and participate in VRE+ DCS process to&#xD;
      include reasonable attention and capacity for immersion. Other areas that will be examined&#xD;
      include medication suitability, expected course of medical treatment that would allow for&#xD;
      reasonable completion of twelve sessions within twenty weeks, and assessed stability in&#xD;
      social support.&#xD;
