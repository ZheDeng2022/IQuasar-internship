      Removal of bile duct stones can be challenging at ERCP, particularly, when the size of the&#xD;
      stone is at least 1.2cm, and may require more than one ERCP session. Various techniques for&#xD;
      removal of difficult bile duct stones include using a balloon to enlarge the opening of the&#xD;
      bile duct (large balloon sphincteroplasty), mechanical lithotripsy or single-operator&#xD;
      cholangioscopy guided laser lithotripsy techniques. There are currently no randomized trials&#xD;
      comparing laser lithotripsy and sphincteroplasty techniques for the removal of difficult bile&#xD;
      duct stones and the aim of this randomized trial is to determine which technique is superior&#xD;
      in the removal of difficult bile duct stones.&#xD;

      Stones in the common bile duct (CBD) can result in various complications including acute&#xD;
      cholangitis, acute pancreatitis and secondary biliary cirrhosis. Bile duct stones should&#xD;
      therefore be removed and this can be successfully achieved in 85-90% of patients with small&#xD;
      bile duct stones using standard endoscopic techniques. This comprises endoscopic&#xD;
      sphincterotomy whereby the duodenal sphincter at the entrance of the bile duct is cut during&#xD;
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) and subsequent removal of the stone is&#xD;
      achieved using standard accessories such as a basket and/or extraction balloon. However,&#xD;
      large/difficult bile duct stones (at least 12mm in size), multiple stones and those located&#xD;
      in non-dilated bile ducts can be difficult to remove by endoscopic sphincterotomy and using&#xD;
      only standard accessories. In such cases, the three most commonly practiced advanced&#xD;
      maneuvers for extraction of difficult CBD stones are mechanical lithotripsy, large balloon&#xD;
      sphincteroplasty (LBS) of the major duodenal papilla and single operator&#xD;
      cholangioscopy-guided laser lithotripsy (SOC-LL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic large balloon sphincteroplasty (using CRE Wireguided Balloon Dilatation Catheter;&#xD;
      Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) is a technique in which a balloon is used to dilate&#xD;
      the papilla located at the bile duct opening by up to 20mm (depending on size of the distal&#xD;
      CBD) after performing an endoscopic sphincterotomy. Following dilation, the stone is removed&#xD;
      using a basket and/or extraction balloon. This technique was shown to be effective in&#xD;
      clearing the bile duct in 50-60% of patients with difficult bile stones in whom initial&#xD;
      endoscopic sphincterotomy was unsuccessful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SpyGlass Direct Visualization System (Boston Scientific Corp., Natick, MA, USA) is a&#xD;
      single-operator cholangioscopy system, which allows direct visualization of the bile duct&#xD;
      stone. The main advantage of this technique is that the cholangioscope can be inserted into&#xD;
      the endoscope and then guided through the bile duct to reach the stone. A probe can then be&#xD;
      inserted into the cholangioscope to allow the energy from laser (laser lithotripsy) to be&#xD;
      accurately focused onto the stone to cause stone fragmentation under direct visualization.&#xD;
      The use of SpyGlass system with laser lithotripsy has been shown to be successful in the&#xD;
      clearance of difficult bile duct stones in 73-100% patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although various methods for removal of bile duct stones exist, there have been thus far no&#xD;
      studies directly comparing endoscopic large balloon sphincteroplasty with&#xD;
      cholangioscopy-guided laser lithotripsy for clearance of difficult bile duct stones. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is therefore to compare the efficiency of the single-operator&#xD;
      cholangioscopy-directed laser lithotripsy using the SpyGlass Direct Visualization system&#xD;
      versus endoscopic large balloon sphincteroplasty for clearance of difficult bile duct stones.&#xD;
