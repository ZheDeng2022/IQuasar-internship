  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators' work proposes to evaluate the effectiveness of the Acid Nicotinique&#xD;
      (Niaspan®), only molecule currently marketed, ready to raise the plasmatic levels of HDL-c.&#xD;
      This effectiveness will be tested among patients having presented recently an acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome. The effectiveness of the molecule will be appreciated versus placebo after&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The technique of evaluation of this effectiveness will be the analysis of the vasodilatation&#xD;
      endothelial-dependent measured on the level huméral (by echography high resolution).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The awaited result is an improvement of 2% in value absolute of this vasodilatation between&#xD;
      the initial test and the end of study for the patients receiving the acid nicotinic versus&#xD;
      those receiving the placebo (3 months of treatment after inclusion). The calculation of the&#xD;
      sample necessary to achieve this goal envisages 70 patients led at the end of the study,&#xD;
      divided into two groups of treatment (acid nicotinic or Placebo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such a result if it were obtained would be higher than that found in studies evaluating the&#xD;
      effect on the vasomotricity endothelial statins or inhibitors of the enzyme of conversion.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The pharmacological assumption of responsibility of the coronary disease has rested partially&#xD;
      for a few years on the regulation of the inhibitors of the HMG CoA reductase (statins). These&#xD;
      drugs initially address to the quantitative anomalies Lipoproteins of low density (LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol). The objectives laid down by the national recommendations (obtaining a plasmatic&#xD;
      rate &lt; 1gr/l in coronary secondary prevention or among patients at the high vascular risk) or&#xD;
      international, implies their broad regulation with the waning of the coronary syndromes. It&#xD;
      can exist in addition among many patients of the qualitative or quantitative anomalies of the&#xD;
      Lipoproteins of High density (HDL-c) whose correlation to the coronary risk was beforehand&#xD;
      largely shown. The anomalies of HDL-c are not very sensitive to the hygieno-dietetic rules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To intervene on the plasmatic levels of the lipoproteins is thus essential with the&#xD;
      improvement of the forecast of the proven coronary patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators know since the beginning of the years 1980 (work of Furchgott and Moncada)&#xD;
      that the endothelium is a powerful integrator of the vascular risk, in particular in its&#xD;
      aspect of regulation vasomotrice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of investigation of the endothelium were developed on the coronary floor or the level&#xD;
      of the peripheral arteries to analyze the vasomotricity endothelial dependent. Among these&#xD;
      methods the study of the vasomotricity on the level huméral is validated, largely used and&#xD;
      correlated in many tests with the forecast of the patients presenting a high vascular risk.&#xD;
