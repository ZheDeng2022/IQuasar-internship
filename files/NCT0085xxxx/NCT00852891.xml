  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study was to analyze changes in cardiac function using Doppler&#xD;
      echocardiogram in critical patients during weaning from mechanical ventilation using two&#xD;
      different weaning methods (pressure support and T-tube) and to compare a subgroup of&#xD;
      patients: success vs. failure in weaning and patients with vs. without heart disease.&#xD;

      Weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV) involves physiological changes that can overload the&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory system due to changes in the interaction between patient and ventilator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a randomized crossover clinical trial that included patients in an intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) who had been on MV for more than 48 hours and who were considered ready for&#xD;
      weaning. Cardiorespiratory variables, oxygenation, electrocardiogram (ECG) and Doppler&#xD;
      echocardiogram findings were analyzed at baseline and after 30 minutes in each trial weaning&#xD;
      method (PSV and T-tube). Comparisons were made between PSV and T-tube, weaning success and&#xD;
      failure and patients with and without heart disease, using ANOVA and Student's t test. The&#xD;
      level of significance was set at p &lt; 0.05.&#xD;

        Patients receiving MV for more than 48 hours, who had been admitted to the Intensive Care&#xD;
        Unit (ICU), and who met the criteria for weaning from MV according to the parameters&#xD;
        previously defined were selected to participate in this study.&#xD;
