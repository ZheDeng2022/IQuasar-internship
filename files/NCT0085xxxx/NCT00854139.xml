  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to cure multiple myeloma with less toxic allogeneic bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation while inducing renal allograft tolerance through mixed chimerism in patients&#xD;
      with end stage renal failure and multiple myeloma&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The induction of transplantation tolerance involves the specific elimination of the immune&#xD;
      response to the transplant but not to other antigens. In the realm of kidney transplantation,&#xD;
      tolerance means that the recipient is unable to detect the donor transplant kidney as&#xD;
      foreign, and therefore the recipient is unable to reject the kidney. Donor bone marrow&#xD;
      engraftment leads to kidney graft tolerance in animal models. Renal failure is a major&#xD;
      complication of multiple myeloma, a plasma cell malignancy for which the only known cure is&#xD;
      allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. Standard bone marrow transplantation is associated&#xD;
      with frequent toxicity in patients with multiple myeloma, and is generally no considered an&#xD;
      option for those patients with end stage renal disease. Myeloma patients are excluded from&#xD;
      conventional renal transplantation protocols because of their underlying malignancy. A less&#xD;
      toxic bone marrow transplantation protocol, combined with renal transplantation, could&#xD;
      provide an opportunity for cure of the myeloma and correction of ESRD in patients with this&#xD;
      disease. In addition, successful marrow engraftment may be expected to lead to a state of&#xD;
      tolerance. Successful implementation of tolerance would be a major benefit to transplant&#xD;
      recipients. The significance of developing tolerance is that the patient would be spared the&#xD;
      disabling complications of indefinite immunosuppression, which include infections, cataracts,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, diabetes, atherosclerosis, hypertension, and malignancy&#xD;

    <description>â€¢ Donor bone marrow (&gt; 2 x 108 nucleated cells/kg of recipient body weight) is prepared for infusion according to the standard procedure at the medical center. A total of 15,000 Units of heparin is mixed with the marrow, which is infused at a rate of 300-500 cc/hr. The infusion begins in the operating room as soon as the vascular anastomosis of the renal allograft has been completed. Protamine, 25 mg, is administered I.V. after completion of the first half of the bone marrow infusion. If a partial thromboplastin time measured after completion of the marrow infusion is &gt; 60 seconds, the protamine treatment shall be repeated</description>
