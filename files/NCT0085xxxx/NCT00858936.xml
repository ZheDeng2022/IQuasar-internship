  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will investigate the safety and effectiveness of IK-1001 (the liquid form&#xD;
      of sodium sulfide) when used in Coronary Artery Bypass Graft (CABG) patients to potentially&#xD;
      reduce the damage done to the heart during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has 2 parts. Part 1 will first test 36 subjects at different doses (amount) of the&#xD;
      study drug. There will be 6 different groups of 6 subjects each that will receive the study&#xD;
      drug or a placebo. A placebo is a substance that will be prepared to look like the study drug&#xD;
      but will contain no active ingredients. In Part 1, five subjects from each group will receive&#xD;
      study drug (IK-1001) and one will receive a placebo. This first part of this study is also a&#xD;
      dose (amount) escalation. This means that each group will be receiving a different dose of&#xD;
      the study drug. The first group will receive the lowest dose, the second group will receive a&#xD;
      slightly higher dose, and the third group a slightly higher dose until all six groups has&#xD;
      been tested. You can not choose which group you will be in but prior to starting each new&#xD;
      dose level, the data (information) from the previous dose level will have been reviewed by a&#xD;
      group of qualified individuals to determine if it is safe to proceed to the next highest dose&#xD;
      level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will expand the study and will treat at least 158 (and up to 632) more subjects at a&#xD;
      dose level that has been deemed safe from information collected from Part 1. Subjects in Part&#xD;
      2 of the study will have a 1 in 2 (50%) chance of receiving the study drug or placebo.&#xD;
      Whether the subject gets study drug or the placebo will be randomly assigned (like the toss&#xD;
      of a coin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug or placebo will be given as an intravenous infusion (into the vein) for six&#xD;
      hours while the subject is having their CABG surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be followed up for 6 months after their CABG surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter, dose escalation&#xD;
      and dose-expansion, study that will evaluate safety, PK, and POC-efficacy of IK-1001 in&#xD;
      subjects undergoing on pump CABG surgery who are at an increased risk for I/R mediated tissue&#xD;
      damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will undergo planned CABG surgery with cardiopulmonary bypass. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted in two parts. Part 1 of the study will involve the dose escalation to evaluate&#xD;
      safety, PK, and preliminary efficacy of IK-1001. Up to 36 eligible subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      into the Part 1 portion and randomized to receive either placebo (n = 6) or IK-1001 (n = 30)&#xD;
      at 6 dose escalating levels of 0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5 mg/kg/hr infusion for 6&#xD;
      hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug administration will begin in the operating room after the induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia and prior to the surgical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After safety, efficacy, and PK data have been evaluated in Part 1, the optimum dose will be&#xD;
      determined and this dose will be expanded in Part 2. Initially up to 158 eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized to receive either IK-1001 or placebo at a 1:1 ratio. Part 2 aims to&#xD;
      further establish safety, PK as well as POC efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that none of the 4 primary endpoints reach at least a 15% decline as compared&#xD;
      with placebo, the Sponsor may decide to amend the protocol to explore a higher dose. After 6&#xD;
      subjects have been dosed at this higher dose level, the data will be reviewed by the Sponsor&#xD;
      or designee for safety and PK and the remaining subjects will then be enrolled. If the safety&#xD;
      and PK data are favorable, the study will be completed at this higher dose level.&#xD;
