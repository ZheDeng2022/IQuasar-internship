  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be performed at the University of Washington. Forty subjects with Cystic&#xD;
      Fibrosis will be enrolled, with 20 randomized into the usual care arm and 20 randomized into&#xD;
      the intervention arm. All subjects will be enrolled for 6 months and have 3 study visits. One&#xD;
      at baseline, midpoint, and final. The intervention arm subjects may have more study visits&#xD;
      depending on their respiratory symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention arm subjects will perform home spirometry twice a week with a PiKo-6 hand&#xD;
      held spirometer. They will also have a home-based telemonitoring system connected to their&#xD;
      phone line. They will be prompted twice a week to answer questions regarding their health via&#xD;
      the telemonitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who are not able to utilize the home-based telemonitoring system will answer the&#xD;
      questions regarding their health via the internet from their home computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject's spirometry falls by greater than 10% from baseline or the CF respiratory&#xD;
      symptoms change in 3 or more of the 8 respiratory symptoms captured by the telemonitor&#xD;
      questionnaire, the subject will be called by the research staff and clinically evaluated by&#xD;
      the study PIs within three days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The usual care subjects will continue with their routine care at the University of Washington&#xD;
      CF Clinic.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study design is a single center, randomized non-blinded controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing usual care to a program of early identification and treatment of pulmonary&#xD;
      exacerbation in adults with CF. Forty subjects will be enrolled a at the University of&#xD;
      Washington with 20 subjects randomized into the usual care arm, and 20 randomized into the&#xD;
      intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care is defined as the regular quarterly CF visits with acute visits triggered by calls&#xD;
      from the patient to the clinic. Neither home assessment of spirometry or standardized home&#xD;
      symptom assessment are a component of usual care. Treatment of a pulmonary exacerbation will&#xD;
      be based on a standard protocol employing a standard definition and treatment regimen. This&#xD;
      study will employ current standardized CF pulmonary exacerbation orders used at the&#xD;
      University of Washington. Usual care arm subjects will have 3 study visits at baseline,&#xD;
      midpoint, and final, over a period of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The early intervention protocol will employ twice a week assessment of home spirometry and CF&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms; we will employ a home based monitoring system from Philips called the&#xD;
      Philips Remote Patient Monitoring system (TeleStation). The home monitoring system is&#xD;
      connected to the patient's phone line; this system is currently used in clinical practice in&#xD;
      the care of patients with diabetes and heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who do not have a home phone line will answer the CF respiratory questions via the&#xD;
      internet from their home computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The home spirometry will be done using a PiKo-6 hand held spirometer up to 84 spirometry&#xD;
      values. If the subject's spirometry falls by greater than 10% from baseline or the CF&#xD;
      respiratory symptoms change in 3 or more of the 8 respiratory symptoms captured in the&#xD;
      questionnaire, the subject will be called by the research staff and clinically evaluated by&#xD;
      the study PIs within three days. This evaluation will include a history and physical exam&#xD;
      along with repeat spirometry at the clinic. The intervention arm subjects will have 3 study&#xD;
      visits at baseline, midpoint, and final, over a period of 6 months. They may have additional&#xD;
      study visits depending on their respiratory symptoms or exacerbations during the 6 month&#xD;
      study period.&#xD;
