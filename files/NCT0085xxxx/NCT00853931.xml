      This is an exploratory study in which all eligible subjects are given Panitumumab according&#xD;
      to the dose and schedule approved by Health Canada. The purpose of this research study is to&#xD;
      determine whether the presence of certain biomarkers (substances measurable in blood, normal&#xD;
      cells or tumour tissue) are associated with an increased or decreased chance of benefit from&#xD;
      panitumumab.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colon cancer affects 20,000 Canadians a year. Despite efforts to improve screening, 8,500&#xD;
      patients will die of the disease (1). The agents used in both the adjuvant and metastatic&#xD;
      setting have dramatically changed over the past ten years. Even with the optimal treatment&#xD;
      and careful follow-up many patients will develop metastasis. For most this is an incurable&#xD;
      condition and the median survival for these patients is only 2 years (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapy with 5-Fluorouracil (FU)/Leucovorin, oxaliplatin and irinotecan with or without&#xD;
      bevacizumab are conventionally used as first and second line therapy for metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Third line therapy options are limited to anti-epidermal growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (EGFR) therapy Cetuximab or Panitumumab either as monotherapy or in combination with&#xD;
      Irinotecan. Recent data (see Table 1) has demonstrated that KRAS mutation status is a&#xD;
      predictor of benefit to anti-EGFR therapy, with wild-type tumours demonstrating a response&#xD;
      rate of 10-17% to monotherapy while a 0% response rate is observed among KRAS mutant tumours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this exploratory study is to examine the correlation of biomarkers (PTEN,&#xD;
      BRAF, amphiregulin, c-MET, EGFR) with response rate among patients with KRAS wild type&#xD;
      tumours treated with panitumumab. If a high response subgroup can be identified, this may&#xD;
      support the use of Panitumumab with combination therapy in the first line setting. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to determine the prognostic and predictive value of CTCs for patients treated&#xD;
      with single agent panitumumab and to describe overall survival (OS) and progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) in registered patients.&#xD;
