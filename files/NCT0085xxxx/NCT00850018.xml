  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD), also known as sickle cell anemia, is an inherited blood disease&#xD;
      that can cause intense pain episodes and may lead to organ failure. Preliminary studies have&#xD;
      shown that adults with SCD may have brain abnormalities that contribute to problems with&#xD;
      cognitive functioning, including attention and memory difficulties. This study will use brain&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and neuropsychological testing to examine the differences in&#xD;
      cognitive functioning in adults with SCD who are treated for anemia with monthly blood&#xD;
      transfusions for 6 months versus adults with SCD who receive usual care for 6 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      SCD is an inherited blood disorder. Symptoms include anemia, infections, organ damage, and&#xD;
      intense episodes of pain, which are called &quot;sickle cell crises.&quot; In the past, SCD was&#xD;
      considered a fatal disease, and many people with SCD died at a young age. Due to advances in&#xD;
      medical care, people with SCD are now living longer lives; however, they often experience a&#xD;
      deterioration in quality of life due to progressive organ failure. Past research has&#xD;
      suggested that children with SCD commonly have frontal lobe dysfunction syndrome, which is a&#xD;
      brain disorder that can affect cognitive functioning in areas such as attention,&#xD;
      concentration, information processing, and decision making. Often times, however,&#xD;
      neurocognitive and brain disorders are not diagnosed or treated in people with SCD. In&#xD;
      preliminary brain imaging studies, at least half of adult participants with SCD had visible&#xD;
      cognitive dysfunction, while participants without SCD rarely had visible changes in the&#xD;
      brain. Brain dysfunction may be one of the most important and least-studied problems&#xD;
      affecting adults with SCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most people with SCD have anemia, or low levels of red blood cells, which are the cells that&#xD;
      carry oxygen to the body's tissues, especially the brain. Research has shown that in people&#xD;
      with anemia who do not have SCD, memory and attention problems have decreased after receiving&#xD;
      treatment for anemia. The purpose of this study is to determine whether people with SCD who&#xD;
      receive monthly blood transfusions to treat their anemia experience greater cognitive&#xD;
      functioning than adults with SCD who receive usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase of this study was an observational study that enrolled adults with SCD and a&#xD;
      control group of healthy adults who did not have SCD. Study procedures included&#xD;
      questionnaires, neuropsychological testing, and MRI testing. At the end of the first phase,&#xD;
      participants were asked if they were willing to take part in a second phase of the overall&#xD;
      study in the future. Enrollment into the first phase ended in February 2008.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current pilot study is the second phase of the overall study. In this study,&#xD;
      participants will begin by completing questionnaires, a medical history review, a physical&#xD;
      exam, a neurological exam, and a blood collection. Women will provide a urine sample for a&#xD;
      pregnancy test. An MRI and neuropsychological testing will also occur. Participants will then&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive either blood transfusions or usual care for 6 months.&#xD;
      Participants assigned to blood transfusions will receive the transfusions every 3 to 4 weeks&#xD;
      for 6 months. Before each transfusion, participants will undergo blood collection and a&#xD;
      review of medical history and medication history. Participants assigned to usual care will&#xD;
      receive a telephone call from study researchers at Months 1, 2, 4, and 5, at which time&#xD;
      medical and medication history will be reviewed. At study visits at Months 3 and 6, these&#xD;
      participants will also undergo a blood collection. At Month 6, all participants will complete&#xD;
      health and quality of life questionnaires, neuropsychological testing, and an MRI.&#xD;

        People who meet any of the following criteria are disqualified from enrollment in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of life threatening or serious transfusion complications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of venous access&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current enrollment in the Arginine study (NCT00513617)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  History of unexplained severe hemolytic transfusion reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of serious allergic, pulmonary transfusion reaction requiring hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive auto-immune hemolytic anemia (direct Coombs test with IgG and complement)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple (three or more) clinically significant allo-antibodies, due to common&#xD;
             antigens (e.g., EC, Kel)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncommon, clinically significant antibody that results in difficulty in finding&#xD;
             matched units (e.g., anti-JKB)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Currently taking Hydroxyurea and not on a stable dose in the 6 months before study&#xD;
             entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine level greater than 1.7 mg/dL&#xD;

             7 mg/g dry weight and not currently on iron chelation therapy. (This is a pilot&#xD;
             transfusion in which only 6 months of transfusion will be utilized. The likelihood of&#xD;
             iron overload induced toxicity from the transfusions over the 6 months is very small.&#xD;
             Furthermore, ferritin is disproportionately elevated in SCD and overestimates the iron&#xD;
             burden. Therefore, a quantitative liver iron and/or ferritin level has been included&#xD;
             as criteria for exclusion.)&#xD;
