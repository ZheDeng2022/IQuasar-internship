      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To establish valid serum total cortisol and salivary cut-offs for use with the short&#xD;
      Synacthen test in patients with normal CBG concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate, using current assays, the effect of assay differences on the serum total&#xD;
      cortisol cut-off.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To explore the performance of these cut-offs in groups of patients with suspected adrenal&#xD;
      insufficiency and high and low serum CBG concentration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: An ACTH test (250 micrograms iv ACTH1-24) will be undertaken in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers, women taking an oestrogen-containing oral contraceptive pill (OCP), patients with&#xD;
      adrenal insufficiency and patients with low serum albumin. Serum cortisol in the samples&#xD;
      collected from healthy volunteers will be measured using GC-MS, Advia Centaur (Siemens),&#xD;
      Architect (Abbott), Modular Analytics E170 (Roche), Immulite 2000 (Siemens) and Access&#xD;
      (Beckman) automated immunoassays. The estimated lower reference limit for the 30 min cortisol&#xD;
      response to ACTH, defined as the 2.5th percentile of log-transformed concentrations, will be&#xD;
      determined in this healthy population and used as a cut-off in the patient groups studied.&#xD;

      Synacthen® is a synthetic analogue of ACTH which has been used since the 1960s to assess&#xD;
      adrenal sufficiency. It is now well established as a first line test to investigate diseases&#xD;
      of the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal axis and to assess adrenal function in patients on&#xD;
      long-term corticosteroid therapy. Briefly, cortisol is measured before and after injection of&#xD;
      250 micrograms of Synacthen®. In a normal individual serum cortisol will rise to&#xD;
      concentrations greater than an arbitrary value (typically 550 nmol/l) 30 minutes after&#xD;
      administration of Synacthen®.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2004 the All Wales Clinical Biochemistry Audit group surveyed protocols for performing and&#xD;
      interpreting short Synacthen® tests. This identified wide differences in practice within&#xD;
      Wales. As a result standards were drawn up for performance of the test. It was noted that&#xD;
      there was considerable variability or bias between cortisol immunoassays and that the&#xD;
      cortisol cut-off chosen for interpretation of the short Synacthen® test should be method&#xD;
      dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clark et al., in 1998 reported cortisol cut-offs following Synacthen® using 4 well&#xD;
      established commercially available cortisol immunoassays. This study demonstrated&#xD;
      considerable differences between the cortisol immunoassays used in clinical laboratories at&#xD;
      the time. It was also apparent that there were differences in gender-related responses to&#xD;
      Synacthen® although there was no dependence on age. In the 8 years since publication of this&#xD;
      study there have been advances in formulation of cortisol immunoassays as well as the&#xD;
      instrumentation used to perform analyses. At the University Hospital of Wales cortisol is&#xD;
      currently assayed using the Bayer Centaur automated immunoassay analyser. This assay was not&#xD;
      available at the time of the study by Clark et al.,. The investigators' current short&#xD;
      Synacthen® test cut-offs therefore rely on historical reference ranges which have become&#xD;
      outdated. A re-evaluation of the cortisol cut-off is required to ensure that patients are not&#xD;
      incorrectly classified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been long been recognised that oestrogens (including ethinyloestradiol prescribed in&#xD;
      combined oral contraceptive pills) increase total (but not free) serum cortisol levels. The&#xD;
      degree of increase is related to the dose used and is thought to be due to an elevation in&#xD;
      cortisol binding globulin (CBG). However, no comparisons of total serum cortisol in response&#xD;
      to Synacthen® have been performed between women taking oestrogens and those who are not.&#xD;
      Knowledge of the salivary cortisol response may also be useful in patients with decreased&#xD;
      serum CBG concentrations e.g. severe nephrotic syndrome in whom the serum cortisol response&#xD;
      may be misleading. The investigators therefore plan to measure salivary cortisol as part of&#xD;
      the investigators' study protocol to assess the response of free cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      17 Hydroxyprogesterone (17OHP) is an intermediate in the biosynthesis of cortisol. Deficiency&#xD;
      of 21-hydroxylase enzyme activity leads to an increased concentration of 17OHP in the&#xD;
      peripheral circulation. The short Synacthen® test can be used to assist in diagnosis of mild&#xD;
      cases of congenital adrenal hyperplasia. Current reference ranges are taken from the&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;
