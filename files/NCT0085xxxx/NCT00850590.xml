  <brief_title>Study of Escalating Doses of NRL001 Given in Slow-release Rectal Suppositories of Different Weights</brief_title>
  <official_title>A Randomised, Placebo-controlled, Double-blind, Dose Escalation Study in Healthy Volunteers to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability, and Pharmacokinetics of Single Doses of Rectal Suppositories Containing Between 5 and 15 mg NRL001 or Matching Placebo for Two Different Sized Suppositories (1 g and 2 g).</official_title>

  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies investigating single doses of different NRL001 formulations showed&#xD;
      formulation-dependent differences in exposure, even though they had similar effects on mean&#xD;
      anal resting pressure (MARP). This study is a first step in investigating the hypothesis that&#xD;
      a better balance between desired anal effects and undesired systemic effects can be reached&#xD;
      with a NRL001-slow release suppository than with previously studied formulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To this purpose, single doses of 5 to 15 mg, administered as 1 g and 2 g suppositories, are&#xD;
      being investigated with regard to their pharmacokinetics and systemic effects (blood&#xD;
      pressure, pulse rate, electrocardiographic heart rate).&#xD;
