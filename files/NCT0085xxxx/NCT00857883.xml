  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a first-time-in-human study. The overall purpose of the study is to assess whether&#xD;
      the drug is safe and well tolerated after single, increasing doses. The blood levels of the&#xD;
      drug after different doses will be measured and the effect of the drug on pleasurable eating&#xD;
      behaviour will be assessed.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The human body naturally produces substances known as opioids and the pleasurable (or&#xD;
      hedonic) response to eating highly sugary or fatty foods is increased by opioids. The drug to&#xD;
      be tested in this study attaches to specific binding sites in the brain, known as mu-opioid&#xD;
      receptors. This may stop the natural effect of opioids and therefore reduce the pleasurable&#xD;
      response to food. We predict that this in turn may help patients with obesity to lose weight&#xD;
      more effectively. The study is divided into three parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: This part of the study will start with a very low dose of study drug, which will then&#xD;
      be gradually increased in subesquent doses. This is known as dose-rising and is the way to&#xD;
      assess safety and tolerability (any side effects that make taking the drug unpleasant).&#xD;
      Effects will be compared to those seen when a placebo (a &quot;dummy&quot; drug) is taken. Up to 4&#xD;
      groups of 6-9 healthy male or female volunteers will be enrolled in this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: A dose selected from Part A that was well tolerated will be used to check if there is&#xD;
      a difference in the blood levels of the study drug when taken without food in liquid form,&#xD;
      without food as a capsule, or with a high fat meal as a capsule. One group of 12 healthy male&#xD;
      or female volunteers will be enrolled in this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C: A well tolerated dose selected from Parts A &amp; B will be used to test whether the drug&#xD;
      has an effect on preferences for sugary and high fat food, when compared to placebo. Up to 32&#xD;
      healthy overweight male volunteers will be enrolled in this part of the study.&#xD;
