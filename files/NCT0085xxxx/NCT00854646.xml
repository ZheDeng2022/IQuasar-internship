  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, Phase I study to determine the highest amount of the study drug, ON&#xD;
      01910.Na, that can be safety given to patients with high risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS)&#xD;
      or refractory leukemias. Patients will receive ON 01910.Na (at a starting dose of 650 mg/m2)&#xD;
      intravenously by 3-day continuous infusion once every 2 weeks. Successive courses will use&#xD;
      longer infusion times and/or higher doses of the drug until toxicity, effectiveness, or&#xD;
      ineffectiveness is recognized. In addition, the amount of drug in the blood will be measured,&#xD;
      any antitumor activity will be documented, and the biological effect of ON 01910.Na on&#xD;
      cell-cycle pathways will be evaluated in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients must have histologically documented or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of acute&#xD;
      myelocytic leukemia refractory to standard induction treatment, or relapsed after standard&#xD;
      therapy; acute lymphocytic leukemia refractory to induction treatment, or relapsed after&#xD;
      effective therapy; chronic myelocytic leukemia refractory to imatinib therapy or second line&#xD;
      tyrosine kinase inhibition, or relapsed after tyrosine kinase inhibition, in chronic,&#xD;
      accelerated, or blastic phase; chronic lymphocytic leukemia refractory to standard therapy,&#xD;
      or relapsed in second relapse; a myelodysplastic syndrome (including chronic myelomonocytic&#xD;
      leukemia) refractory to azacitidine; and an int-2 or high myelodysplastic syndrome relapsed&#xD;
      after a hypomethylating agent. Patients may not be eligible for, or must have declined, bone&#xD;
      marrow transplantation or other chemotherapeutic regimens known to produce consistent&#xD;
      remissions. Because hematopoietic criteria in leukemia and lymphoma are confounded by the&#xD;
      nature of the diseases themselves, there are no hematologic exclusions from treatment. If&#xD;
      leukopenia is clinically determined to be attributable to prior treatment, ON 01910.Na&#xD;
      treatment may start when the leukocyte count increases on two successive determinations&#xD;
      performed at least three days apart. Thrombocytopenia is not a criterion, and patients will&#xD;
      be supported with platelet transfusions as clinically necessary. In the absence of&#xD;
      leukopenia, a failed prior treatment may be succeeded immediately by entry into study of ON&#xD;
      01910.Na if the leukocyte count is stable or rising, on two successive determinations&#xD;
      performed at least three days apart, in the absence of other drug toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population will involve approximately 12 to 28 patients â‰¥ 18 years of age in the&#xD;
      dose escalation portion of the protocol. All patients must have relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      leukemia or poor risk MDS (i.e., int-2 or high risk MDS who have failed standard therapy).&#xD;
      They must not be candidates for known regimens or protocol treatments of higher efficacy or&#xD;
      priority. Patients with relapsed/refractory leukemia or poor risk MDS must have an ECOG&#xD;
      Performance Status of 0, 1, or 2. Patients must have an expected survival, in the opinion of&#xD;
      the Investigator, to allow a sufficient observation period for evaluating ON 01910.Na, and&#xD;
      meet the eligibility criteria for patients with leukemia or poor risk MDS. After the&#xD;
      maximally tolerated dose and the Recommended Phase II Dose (RPTD) and duration are&#xD;
      determined, up to 12 additional patients with histologically documented or cytologically&#xD;
      confirmed leukemia or poor risk MDS will be added to confirm the appropriateness of the RPTD.&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the dose confirmation phase will be similar to those of the dose&#xD;
      escalation phase of the study, but the ECOG Performance Status must be 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data, including laboratory parameters and adverse events, will be collected for all&#xD;
      patients in order to determine the qualitative and quantitative toxicity, and reversibility&#xD;
      of toxicity, of ON 01910.Na. Leukemic cells and MDS cells in peripheral blood will be&#xD;
      measured on a daily basis during infusion, and at least two times weekly during the following&#xD;
      week. If leukemic cells disappear from the blood or blood counts improve as defined by IWG&#xD;
      criteria in MDS patients, a bone marrow aspiration will be performed to determine response&#xD;
      status in the bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients may continue therapy for at least six cycles unless rapid disease progression is&#xD;
      documented. Patients with an objective clinical response or stable disease can continue up to&#xD;
      six more cycles. Further continuation will be determined by the clinical judgment of the&#xD;
      Investigator.&#xD;
