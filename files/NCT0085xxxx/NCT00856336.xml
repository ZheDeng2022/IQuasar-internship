  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This was a phase I study aimed at identifying safe doses of DMXAA (now known as ASA404) to be&#xD;
      used in future combination studies with chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a multi-centre randomized, double blind study to further characterize the effect of&#xD;
      DMXAA on QTc interval, ophthalmic safety and pharmacodynamic effects on tumour blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with refractory tumors were to each undergo six doses of treatment at weekly&#xD;
      intervals, receiving each of six doses of DMXAA (300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400 and 3000 mg/m2)&#xD;
