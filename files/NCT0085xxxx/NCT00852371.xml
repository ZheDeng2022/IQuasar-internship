  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, single-blinded, placebo-controlled trial to evaluate the efficacy,&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of antimalarial regimens in healthy schoolchildren. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to compare the efficacy of different combination antimalarial&#xD;
      regimens, including amodiaquine + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AQ+SP),&#xD;
      dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP), and placebo, to SP for intermittent preventive treatment&#xD;
      (IPT) in schoolchildren, as measured by risk of parasitaemia (unadjusted by genotyping) after&#xD;
      42 days of follow-up. This will assess both the efficacy for treatment of asymptomatic&#xD;
      infections and the efficacy for prevention of new infections.&#xD;

      The study will be carried out among children aged ≥ 8 to &lt; 14 years (boys) and ≥ 8 to &lt; 12&#xD;
      years (girls) attending primary schools in Tororo district. Schools will be selected using&#xD;
      convenience sampling with the assistance of the district and the education sector. The target&#xD;
      population includes children attending primary schools in Uganda. The accessible population&#xD;
      includes the children attending the participating primary schools in classes 3-7 in Tororo&#xD;
      district. Children who meet the selection criteria for participation in the study will be&#xD;
      randomized to treatment with one of the four study regimens and will be followed for 42 days.&#xD;
      Repeat evaluations will be performed on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 42 (and any unscheduled&#xD;
      day that a student is ill) and will include assessment for the occurrence of adverse events.&#xD;
      Treatment efficacy outcomes will be assessed using revised WHO outcome classification&#xD;
      criteria. Acceptability of treatment regimens will be assessed using a questionnaire&#xD;
      administered to participating students on day 7. The primary outcome measure is risk of&#xD;
      parasitaemia (unadjusted by genotyping) after 42 days of follow-up.&#xD;
