    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer the most frequent neoplasm and the fifth mortality rate of malignancies of&#xD;
      the women in the world. It results in about 1,000 women in Taiwan and about 200,000 women&#xD;
      worldwide dying of cervical cancer each year. Human papilloma viruses (HPV) have been&#xD;
      consistently implicated in causing cervical cancer especially those high-risk types (HPV&#xD;
      16,18,31,45) have been strongly associated with cervical cancer. Around 50-80 % of women are&#xD;
      infected by HPV within their whole lives. However, only 1% of HPV-infected women have&#xD;
      cervical cancer eventually. Seventy and 91% of HPV infection could be cleaned up by host&#xD;
      immune responses within 1 and 2 years later. It shows that host immunity plays an important&#xD;
      role in the progression, persistence, or regression of HPV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two main defense lines in the host immunity including innate immunity and adoptive&#xD;
      immunity. Adoptive immunity plays more important roles in the defense of HPV infections than&#xD;
      innate immunity. The adoptive immunity could be further divided into humoral immunity and&#xD;
      cell-mediated immunity. Humoral immunity regulated by Th2 helper T lymphocytes to generate&#xD;
      memory B cells to produce antibody which provide the protective function to HPV infection.&#xD;
      Cell-mediated immunity regulated by Th1 helper T lymphocytes to induce antigen-specific&#xD;
      cytotoxic T cells which could kill the HPV-infected cells. Although there are many researches&#xD;
      focused on the immunity to HPV infection, there is no conclusion about the relationship&#xD;
      between humoral and cell-mediated immunities on HPV infection and roles of humoral and&#xD;
      cell-mediated immunities in the prognosis of HPV-infected population and cervical cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team has focused on the establishment of platforms on cell-mediated immunity to&#xD;
      HPV infection and on the correlation of cell-mediated immunity and prognosis of HPV-infected&#xD;
      population and cervical cancer patients for years. In order to survey the host immunity to&#xD;
      HPV infection more comprehensively, we propose this 3-year proposal. First, we would like to&#xD;
      set up the platforms to survey the humoral immunity to HPV infection in normal population and&#xD;
      patients with CIN lesion or cervical cancer. Second, we would to elucidate the correlation&#xD;
      between humoral immunity and status and clinico-pathologic items of HPV-infected populations.&#xD;
      Third, we would like to survey if the humoral immunity correlate with the prognosis of&#xD;
      patients with cervical lesions. Fourth, we would like to elucidate the correlation betweenHLA&#xD;
      haplotype and humoral immunity in HPV-infected populations. Our research results will have a&#xD;
      more comprehensive overview in the host immunity to HPV infection and its related diseases.&#xD;
      It could provide more information in the prevention and treatment of HPV infection in the&#xD;
      future.&#xD;
