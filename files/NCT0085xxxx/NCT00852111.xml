      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers have studied the causes of fatigue during treatments for various diseases,&#xD;
           but these results have not been conclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More information on the physical changes that affect the body during treatment may help&#xD;
           identify biological or chemical factors that contribute to patient fatigue, which may&#xD;
           allow physicians to identify individuals who may be more at risk of feeling fatigue&#xD;
           before, during, and after treatment for diseases such as cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify factors contributing to fatigue in men who are undergoing radiation&#xD;
           treatment for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men 18 years of age and older who are scheduled to receive localized radiation treatment&#xD;
           for prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six outpatient visits to the NIH Clinical Center, approximately on the same day and same&#xD;
           time of day:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First visit before beginning radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once a week for the first 2 weeks of the treatment, once at the midpoint of treatment,&#xD;
           once at the end of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final visit 4 weeks after completion of radiation treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial visit will involve a physical examination and questions about medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluations during the treatment period:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood draws to identify cells and chemicals associated with inflammation and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions about physical activity, fatigue, depression, and quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although the underlying mechanisms of fatigue have been studied in several disease conditions&#xD;
      the data are not conclusive, and this symptom remains poorly managed at present. Longitudinal&#xD;
      studies related to treatment-related fatigue in prostate cancer patients have been conducted,&#xD;
      but there are limited studies exploring the changes in physiologic mechanisms before and&#xD;
      after radiotherapy which can identify individuals who are at risk for enduring fatigue during&#xD;
      and after therapy. Fatigue is conceptualized as a multidimensional symptom which incorporates&#xD;
      temporal, sensory, cognitive/mental, affective/emotional, behavioral, and physiological&#xD;
      dimensions. This prospective, observational study is the first study to explore the&#xD;
      molecular-genetic mechanisms underlying fatigue and the cluster of symptoms (urinary, sexual,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, psychiatric) experienced by prostate cancer patients undergoing External&#xD;
      Beam Radiation Therapy (EBRT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to describe the changes in the self-reported fatigue;&#xD;
      urinary, sexual, and gastrointestinal symptoms; depression; fatigue catastrophizing; and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life (HRQOL) experienced by patients with and without prostate&#xD;
      surgery before, during, and after EBRT completion. The secondary objectives of this study are&#xD;
      to investigate the pro-inflammatory cytokine profile of EBRT-related fatigue (TNF alpha,&#xD;
      IGF-I, IL-6, IL-8, TGF alpha and beta), determine changes in white blood cell gene&#xD;
      expression, determine levels of oxidative stress and changes in potential biomarkers&#xD;
      influencing oxidative stress from blood and buccal samples before and after EBRT completion&#xD;
      and to relate these changes in the levels of these biological markers to self-reported&#xD;
      fatigue; urinary, sexual, and gastrointestinal symptoms; depression; fatigue catastrophizing;&#xD;
      and HRQOL scores. This study also aims to measure the skeletal muscle strength,&#xD;
      activity/fitness levels, cognitive function and energy expenditure of patients before, at&#xD;
      completion of EBRT, and at least 6 months post EBRT and relate these findings with&#xD;
      self-reported fatigue, physical symptoms (e.g. urinary, gastrointestinal, and sexual&#xD;
      functioning), depression, and HRQOL scores before and after an exercise training program. The&#xD;
      study also aims to describe changes in chemical profile in the brain that are associated with&#xD;
      changes in fatigue symptoms using magnetic resonance spectroscopy before and after EBRT.&#xD;

        This protocol will enroll 262 men with prostate cancer, 161 (116 without prior&#xD;
        prostatectomy and 45 with previous prostatectomy) who are scheduled to receive EBRT.&#xD;
        Additional 56 men will be invited to participate in 8-week, an hour/day, 3 days/week&#xD;
        aerobic exercise programs (CT [N=28], HIIT [N=28]). It will also enroll 45 men with&#xD;
        prostate cancer who are not currently receiving any treatment to serve as the control group&#xD;
        for the study. Ten additional prostate cancer subjects (with and without previous&#xD;
        prostatectomy) who are scheduled to be treated with EBRT will also be enrolled for the&#xD;
        pilot study subgroup to determine associations between fatigue with structural and chemical&#xD;
        changes of the brain using magnetic resonance spectrospcopy (MRS). Thirty additional men&#xD;
        (with and without previous prostatectomy) will be enrolled for the pilot study subgroup to&#xD;
        collect buccal swabs to measure proteins related to mitochondrial function. The study will&#xD;
        enroll a total of 262 subjects.&#xD;
