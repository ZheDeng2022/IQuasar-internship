      Research Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with dasatinib 100 mg QD is superior to imatinib 600 mg QD in terms of complete&#xD;
      cytogenetic response (CCyR) in chronic phase (CP) Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph+)&#xD;
      Chronic Myeloid Leukemia (CML) subjects who are imatinib failures or who have achieved only a&#xD;
      suboptimal response after 3-18 months (12-77 weeks) of therapy with imatinib 400 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to compare the rate of CCyR of dasatinib (100mg QD) to&#xD;
      high-dose imatinib (600 mg QD) therapy at 6 months after randomization in CP Ph+ CML subjects&#xD;
      who are imatinib failures or who have achieved only a suboptimal response after 3 - 18 months&#xD;
      of imatinib monotherapy at 400 mg/day.&#xD;

      Study Design: Prospective open-label, randomized two arms, multicenter study for the patients&#xD;
      with suboptimal response to standard Tx to evaluate efficacy &amp; safety of dasatinib (100mg qd)&#xD;
      &amp; imatinib (600mg daily) by CyR &amp; MoR at 3, 6 &amp; 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized 1:1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Crossover to alternate be permitted after confirmed PD at 3M (AP, BC &amp; loss of CHR or&#xD;
           MCyR) &amp; absence of any response at 6M.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study: Subjects will be treated for up to 12 months, unless disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity occurs, the subject withdraws, or the study is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Study: Subjects will be treated for up to 12 months, unless disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity occurs, the subject withdraws, or the study is discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Subjects: A total of 90 subjects will be randomized in 1:1 randomization ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Subjects 18 years of age or older with CP Ph+ CML and who are imatinib&#xD;
      failures or ave achieved only a suboptimal response after 3 - 18 months (12 - 77 weeks) of&#xD;
      treatment with 400 mg/day of imatinib monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Product, Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the dasatinib arm will begin treatment with dasatinib at an oral dose of 100 mg&#xD;
      QD. One dose reduction to 70 mg due to toxicity will be allowed. One dose escalation to 140&#xD;
      mg is allowed under specified circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference Therapy, Dose and Mode of Administration, Duration of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the imatinib arm will begin treatment with imatinib at an oral dose of 600 mg QD&#xD;
      Doses of imatinib can be escalated to 800 mg for patients with inadequate response at 3&#xD;
      months and dose reduction of imatinib is not permitted for any cases of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for Evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Endpoint: CCyR rate at 6 months after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  MMR rates at 3, 6, and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CCyR rates at 3, 6 and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CHR rates at 3, 6and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to-, and duration of-, MMR and CCyR&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse experiences associated with dasatinib or imatinib treatment will be reported for all&#xD;
      treated subjects. Adverse events will be assessed continuously and graded according to the&#xD;
      NCI Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 3.0.&#xD;

    <description>Dasatinib Dasatinib will be administered orally at a dose of 100 mg QD. During the first month, subjects will be instructed to take dasatinib in the morning.&#xD;
Imatinib Imatinib will be administered orally at a dose of 600 mg once daily (QD). Each 600 mg dose should be administered with a meal and taken with a large glass of water. If a scheduled dose is missed for more than 12 hours or dosing is interrupted for toxicity or for any other reason, these doses should be omitted.</description>
