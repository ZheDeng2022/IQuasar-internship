      It is hypothesized that other anti-angiogenic agents such as endostar, may augment the effect&#xD;
      of chemotherapy regimens in CRC. Endostar, a recombinant human endostatin which expressed and&#xD;
      purified in E. coli, was approved by the SFDA for the treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer&#xD;
      in 2005. Ling et al. found that endostar suppressed the VEGF-stimulated proliferation,&#xD;
      migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro,&#xD;
      and the antiangiogenic effects of endostar were correlated with the VEGF-triggered signaling.&#xD;
      (Ling et al, 2007) A Chinese phase III clinical trial in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer,&#xD;
      endostar--a new angiogenesis inhibitor prolonged the overall survival, time to progression&#xD;
      and improved response rate. (Wang et al, 2005) Based on these results, the investigators&#xD;
      design this phase II clinical trial of oxaliplatin, capecitabine and endostar as first line&#xD;
      treatment, to evaluate whether endostar can bring survival benefits to patients with advanced&#xD;
      colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      Among the different combination regimens of new drugs in CRC treatment, the combination of&#xD;
      capecitabine and oxaliplatin seems especially attractive. Both drugs have a different and&#xD;
      relatively mild toxicity profile. In phase II studies that used the recommended dose of XELOX&#xD;
      (capecitabine 1000 mg/m2 twice daily on days 1-14 with intravenous oxaliplatin 130 mg/m2 on&#xD;
      day 1 every 3 weeks), RRs were between 42% and 55%, with PFS times of 6.0 to 7.7 months,&#xD;
      which showed that the XELOX combination was effective in the first-line treatment of patients&#xD;
      with metastatic CRC. (Cassidy et al, 2004; Scheithauer et al, 2003)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colorectal carcinomas (CRC) are characterised by enhanced VEGF expression and the&#xD;
      corresponding high microvascular densities, indicating increased angiogenic activity and&#xD;
      leading to worse patient survival.(Zheng et al, 2003; Des Guetz et al, 2006) Recently, the&#xD;
      final results of XELOX-1/NO16966, a study of first line therapy, confirmed that&#xD;
      bevacizumab+chemotherapy (XELOX or FOLFOX) was superior to chemotherapy alone in terms of PFS&#xD;
      (HR 0.83; p=0.0023) although the OS data did not reach statistical significance (HR 0.89;&#xD;
      p=0.0769). (Saltz et al, 2008)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bevacizumab data provide a treatment option for patients with metastatic CRC based on&#xD;
      VEGF inhibition. It is hypothesized that other anti-angiogenic agents such as endostar, may&#xD;
      augment the effect of chemotherapy regimens in CRC. Endostar, a recombinant human endostatin&#xD;
      which expressed and purified in E. coli, was approved by the SFDA for the treatment of&#xD;
      non-small-cell lung cancer in 2005. Ling et al. found that endostar suppressed the&#xD;
      VEGF-stimulated proliferation, migration, and tube formation of human umbilical vein&#xD;
      endothelial cells (HUVECs) in vitro, and the antiangiogenic effects of endostar were&#xD;
      correlated with the VEGF-triggered signaling. (Ling et al, 2007) A Chinese phase III clinical&#xD;
      trial in advanced non-small-cell lung cancer, endostar--a new angiogenesis inhibitor&#xD;
      prolonged the overall survival, time to progression and improved response rate. (Wang et al,&#xD;
      2005) Based on these results, we design this phase II clinical trial of oxaliplatin,&#xD;
      capecitabine and endostar as first line treatment, to evaluate whether endostar can bring&#xD;
      survival benefits to patients with advanced colorectal cancer.&#xD;
