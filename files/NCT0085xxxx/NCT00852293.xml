  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chitinase and chitinase like proteins are members of the 18-glycosyl-hydrolase family.&#xD;
      Several reports have linked the chitinase 3 like 1 protein with colitis, asthma and liver&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the correlation of chitinase 3 like 1 protein with clinical&#xD;
      parameters such as disease severity, reaction to treatment, portal hypertension and&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chitin is a poly saccharide, abundant in insects, fungi, crustaceans and other organisms, but&#xD;
      not in mammals. Chitinases and chitinase like proteins (which have the ability to bind chitin&#xD;
      without enzymatic activity) are members of the 18-glycosyl-hydrolase family. Their function&#xD;
      and importance are still not clearly understood. However, several reports have linked the&#xD;
      chitinase 3 like 1 protein with colitis and asthma. Furthermore, Johansen et al have reported&#xD;
      elevated levels of chitinase 3 like 1 protein in patients with liver disease, mainly those&#xD;
      with alcoholic liver disease (ALD) and fibrosis. This report consisted of 51 patients with&#xD;
      ALD ,but only 16 and 17 patients with fatty liver and viral hepatitis respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate the correlation of chitinase 3 like 1 protein with clinical&#xD;
      parameters such as disease severity, reaction to treatment, portal hypertension (when&#xD;
      measured) and prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ***Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Subjects i.The study will include patients with liver disease followed at the liver unit,&#xD;
      Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem. b. Planned number i.The study is planned to include 200&#xD;
      volunteers. c. Inclusion criteria i.Patients with liver disease followed at the liver unit at&#xD;
      Hadassah Medical Center. ii.Patients who have given their informed consent for participation&#xD;
      in the study. d. Exclusion criteria i.Age&lt;18y. ii.Pregnancy iii.Patients with other&#xD;
      conditions associated with elevated chitinase 3 like 1 protein (such as asthma and rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis). e. Chitinase 3 like-1 protein levels will be measured by a commercially available&#xD;
      kit (Human Chitinase 3-like 1 Quantikine ELISA Kit, catalogue number - DC3L1, Biotest LTD).&#xD;
      f. Stopping/modifying criteria i.At subjects' request. g. Trial entry and enrollment i.A&#xD;
      consecutive cohort will be recruited form amongst the patients followed at the liver unit in&#xD;
      Hadassah medical center. Jerusalem Israel. ii.Consenting patients will have a blood test&#xD;
      drawn for chitinase 3 like 1 protein levels. iii.Clinical details of each patient will be&#xD;
      obtained form the liver unit. iv.In addition to the routine follow up at the liver unit,&#xD;
      follow up will be performed at 1,2 and 5 years. h. Statistical considerations i.Subjects will&#xD;
      be grouped according to their clinical properties (disease, treatment, severity, portal&#xD;
      hypertension) ii.Chitinase 3 like 1 protein levels will be compared between each group. F.&#xD;
      Informed consent i.Each subject will be enrolled and enter the study only after giving an&#xD;
      informed consent. G. Adherence to study eligibility i.The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines, and the study protocol. H.&#xD;
      Safeguarding of documents i.The privacy of the subjects and all confidentiality issues will&#xD;
      be handled in accordance with applicable law and guidelines of the institution and the&#xD;
      Helsinki Committee, the Israeli ministry of health, or the other appropriate regulatory&#xD;
      authorities.&#xD;
