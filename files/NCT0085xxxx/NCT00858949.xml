  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational study with the goal of determining the costs of nausea and vomiting&#xD;
      in ambulatory patients after surgery from the US societal perspective.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The direct cost between the end of outpatient surgery and discharge from the hospital will&#xD;
      include costs of labors and supplies for any outpatient care, physician visits, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, and prescribed medications, which may be used to treat operation side effects. Based&#xD;
      on the time and motion study design, the timing of these healthcare activities will be&#xD;
      collected. The study coordinator will observe the actual time taken for each activity for&#xD;
      each patient. The observation period will begin after completion of the outpatient surgery.&#xD;
      The start and end times for each activity performed will be recorded. Therefore, each&#xD;
      activity and its duration will be concurrently recorded. We will also query patients daily to&#xD;
      determine additional costs associated with PONV until the third postoperative morning.&#xD;
