  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study of the genetics of malaria transmission by the mosquito vector in Africa,&#xD;
      Anopheles gambiae. The study focuses on the mosquito vector, not the human subjects infected&#xD;
      with malaria. DNA extracted from infected mosquitoes will be analyzed genetically by&#xD;
      microsatellite and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to identify mosquito genes that&#xD;
      control mosquito resistance to malaria parasites.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A standard diagnostic blood smear from a drop of blood will be carried out on 20 study&#xD;
      subjects once per month. One malaria-positive subject from among the 20 will be asked to&#xD;
      donate 5cc of blood, also no more frequently than once per month. The blood will be placed in&#xD;
      a water-jacketed heated membrane feeding device that will be positioned on top of a cage of&#xD;
      mosquitoes. The mosquitoes are attracted to the warmth and drink the blood through the&#xD;
      artificial skin-like membrane. The goal of the research is to study the infected mosquitoes.&#xD;
      No studies will be carried out on the human subjects. The point of human subjects involvement&#xD;
      is to obtain the naturally malaria-infected blood for feeding of mosquitoes. After blood&#xD;
      feeding, the mosquitoes are held in an environmental chamber for one week, at which time they&#xD;
      are dissected to count numbers of malaria parasites developing on the mosquito stomach wall.&#xD;
      This number constitutes the quantitative phenotype, and we extract genomic DNA from the&#xD;
      carcass for genetic marker typing, which constitutes the genotype. Genetic linkage analysis&#xD;
      identifies markers near genes that control parasite number, thus resistance or susceptibility&#xD;
      to parasite infection.&#xD;
