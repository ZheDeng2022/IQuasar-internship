      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Dietary&#xD;
      supplements, such as phytochemicals, may stop or delay the development of breast cancer. It&#xD;
      is not yet known whether giving docetaxel together with a phytochemical is more effective&#xD;
      than giving docetaxel alone in treating patients with breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II trial is studying how well giving docetaxel together with a&#xD;
      phytochemical works compared with giving docetaxel alone as first- or second-line therapy in&#xD;
      treating patients with breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the response rate in HER2-negative patients with locally advanced or&#xD;
           metastatic breast cancer or locoregional breast cancer recurrence treated with docetaxel&#xD;
           and a dietary phytochemical vs docetaxel alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the overall clinical benefit rate (i.e., objective response plus stable&#xD;
           disease) in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare time to progression in patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare overall survival of patients treated with these regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess biomarkers of response in blood samples from patients treated with these&#xD;
           regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to recruitment center&#xD;
      and line of chemotherapy (first vs second line of docetaxel). Patients are randomized to 1 of&#xD;
      2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients receive docetaxel IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3&#xD;
           weeks for up to 6 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II: Patients receive docetaxel as in arm I. Patients also receive an oral dietary&#xD;
           phytochemical twice on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3 weeks for up to 6 courses in the&#xD;
           absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study therapy, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
