      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and side effects of a study product that&#xD;
      contains recombinant modified peanut proteins (EMP-123) in healthy and peanut-allergic&#xD;
      participants. This is a first in human study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of November 2009, this study is no longer recruiting healthy volunteers and will only be&#xD;
      recruiting individuals with peanut allergies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Peanut allergy is a common ailment in the United States. Research suggests that the&#xD;
      prevalence of peanut allergy in the United States has doubled over the last 5 years.&#xD;
      Currently, the only effective treatment for peanut allergy is a peanut-free diet and quick&#xD;
      access to self-injectable epinephrine. This study will evaluate the safety of a rectally&#xD;
      administered product, EMP-123, consisting of three recombinant modified peanut protein&#xD;
      antigens encapsulated within dead E. coli. E. coli is a common bacterium found in everyone's&#xD;
      colon. E. coli acts like a package to hold the modified peanut proteins. EMP-123 is designed&#xD;
      to act as an allergy vaccine with an eventual goal to induce tolerance to the major peanut&#xD;
      proteins responsible for peanut allergy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will involve weekly dosing and for females, a pregnancy test will occur at 48&#xD;
      hours before the start of product administration and later during the study. The study will&#xD;
      involve two steps. Step 1 will enroll 5 healthy participants who will receive four escalating&#xD;
      doses of study product on a weekly basis. Participants will be monitored at the clinic for 2&#xD;
      hours after receiving each dose of study product. Each dosing visit will be followed with a&#xD;
      phone interview to assess any adverse effects or symptoms. Participants in Step 1 will&#xD;
      maintain a home diary and record any symptoms that occur between visits. After screening,&#xD;
      Step 1 will consist of five study visits on Weeks 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8. Vital signs, adverse&#xD;
      event monitoring, and review of the home diary will occur at all visits. Breathing tests will&#xD;
      occur at most visits. Stool and urine collection will occur at Weeks 4 and 8. The expected&#xD;
      duration of Step 1 is 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no safety concerns are identified at the conclusion of Step 1, 10 peanut-allergic&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled into the second phase of the study, Step 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2 is expected to last 20 weeks. Participants in Step 2 will receive weekly dose&#xD;
      escalation of the study product for 10 weeks followed by administration every 2 weeks for 6&#xD;
      weeks. Participants will remain in the clinic for 2 hours after every dose is received.&#xD;
      Follow-up will then continue for 4 weeks after the conclusion of treatment. Each dosing visit&#xD;
      will be followed with a phone interview to assess any adverse effects or symptoms. After&#xD;
      screening, Step 2 will consist of 14 study visits. Vital signs, adverse event monitoring, and&#xD;
      a review of the home diary will occur at all visits. Breathing tests will occur at most&#xD;
      visits. A skin prick test and stool, blood, and urine collection will occur at select visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of November 2009, this study is no longer recruiting healthy volunteers and will only be&#xD;
      recruiting individuals with peanut allergies.&#xD;
