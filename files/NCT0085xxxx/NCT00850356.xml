  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to determine the economic, clinical and quality of life outcomes of bariatric&#xD;
      surgery and describe the consequences of protracted wait-times (~ 2 years) for this&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Severe obesity affects approximately 3% of Canadians (nearly 1 million people) and is&#xD;
      becoming increasingly common and costly. Surgery for severe obesity, known as bariatric&#xD;
      surgery, substantially reduces weight and the risk of death, decreases obesity-related health&#xD;
      problems and increases quality of life. However, surgery carries a 0.5-2% up-front risk of&#xD;
      death, has potentially serious short and long-term complications, and an uncertain&#xD;
      cost-to-benefit ratio. Surgery is becoming increasingly popular, programs are being initiated&#xD;
      or expanded across the country, and waiting lists are several years long. Provincial&#xD;
      governments, unable to keep pace with surgical demand, are sending patients to the US for&#xD;
      surgery and patients are petitioning governments for increased access to care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By collecting data from a clinical obesity program that services an entire Canadian health&#xD;
      region of over 1 million people and linking these data to provincial and regional data&#xD;
      sources, this study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine whether surgery improves 2-yr medical and patient-centered outcomes (such as&#xD;
           quality of life, satisfaction, and others) compared to both medical and community&#xD;
           wait-list control patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Comprehensively compare the 3-yr costs of surgical and non-surgical care;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the impact of 2-yr wait times for surgery on patient health and wellness,&#xD;
           including quality of life and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide essential data to accurately determine the benefits, risks, and costs&#xD;
      of bariatric surgery in the Canadian context for patients, care providers, and decision&#xD;
      makers. Equally important, it will determine whether the health and quality of life of&#xD;
      Canadians waiting for surgery is adversely affected because of extended wait-times. Results&#xD;
      will directly influence and streamline patient care, will be applicable to similar programs&#xD;
      across the country, and serve as an important foundation for future research and data&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;

        Three participant goups (n=500:)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Bariatric Surgery(Sx):150 participants. Patients approved for bariatric surgery in an Adult&#xD;
        Weight Management Clinic (AWMC) will be eligible (BMI ≥35 kg/m2 and a major medical&#xD;
        comorbidity or BMI ≥ 40 kg/m2). Contraindications to surgery are pregnancy, unstable&#xD;
        psychiatric disease, patients deemed too medically high-risk, age &gt; 60 years, active&#xD;
        substance abuse, or an active eating disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Medical Treatment(Mx):200 participants. Patients will be approached for the study upon&#xD;
        their first visit in the AWMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both medical and surgical patients receive intensive lifestyle counseling (diets, exercise,&#xD;
        behavioral modification) delivered according to current recommendations. Other than&#xD;
        receiving extra education about surgery and post-operative diets, there is no difference in&#xD;
        care between the medical and surgical arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Community Wait-List Control(Wx):150 participants will be enrolled from the list of newly&#xD;
        referred patients to the AWMC.&#xD;
