      Direct intravitreal administration of medication is the preferred method of treatment for&#xD;
      uveitis and retinal vascular disorders. The eye is a self contained organ relatively isolated&#xD;
      from the systemic circulation by the tight blood retinal barrier. Effective intraocular drug&#xD;
      levels can be achieved with a much smaller amount of medication if injected intravitreally&#xD;
      and this also results in minimal systemic exposure to the patient. Preliminary studies have&#xD;
      shown that adalimumab may have a positive role in the management of uveitis in humans and can&#xD;
      be an effective treatment intravitreally in animal models. No data has been published yet on&#xD;
      intravitreal use of adalimumab in human subjects.&#xD;

      Abstract Purpose: Our aim is study to determine the efficacy and safety of intravitreal&#xD;
      adalimumab in patients with active vision threatening uveitis, diabetic macular edema (DME)&#xD;
      and choroidal neovascularization (CNV) despite standard treatment and to ensure its safety in&#xD;
      intravitreal use in humans and its rapid onset of action.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Pilot study, Non-Randomized, Open Label, Single Group Assignment, Safety Study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: 15 eyes with refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis will be injected with intravitreal&#xD;
      adalimumab on a 3 week interval. Patients will satisfy the inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      listed at the end.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Initial treatment will consist of intravitreal adalimumab injection (1.5 mg/ 0.03&#xD;
      mL) in the eyes of patients with refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis and with visual acuity less&#xD;
      than or equal to 20/70. Patients will be followed up every 3 weeks for a total of 6 weeks.&#xD;
      Patients will have a baseline best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA), slit lamp examination,&#xD;
      dilated fundus examination, ocular coherence tomography (OCT), fluorescein angiography (F.A),&#xD;
      and standard electroretinogram (ERG) and then these studies will be repeated every visit. If&#xD;
      there is stabilization or improvement in visual acuity, decrease in edema on OCT and leakage&#xD;
      on F.A after the first injection, then further injections will be given. The injection will&#xD;
      be delayed if a patient develops an acute systemic infection and will be given when it&#xD;
      subsides. If there is worsening of visual acuity after the first injection, patients will be&#xD;
      shifted to the traditional treatment with intravitreal Avastin or intravitreal steroids. The&#xD;
      paired sample Student t- test, Chi-square test, Pearson correlation and ANOVA will be used to&#xD;
      analyze the mean visual acuity and central retinal thickness before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome measures: to study the response to intravitreal adalimumab injection of patients&#xD;
      with different visual acuity at baseline measured in terms of improvement in visual acuity,&#xD;
      shrinkage in central retinal thickness, reduction in fluid leakage, and decrease in the&#xD;
      active inflammatory uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: Our goal is to study the efficacy and intraocular safety of intravitreal&#xD;
      adalimumab in the treatment of refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background and Significance Inflammatory mediators are involved in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      diabetic retinopathy, choroidal neovascularization and uveitis. Owing to the propensity for&#xD;
      visual loss, immunosuppressive treatment in the form of systemic and/or local therapy is&#xD;
      often required for the management of cystoids macular edema from posterior uveitis, diabetes&#xD;
      or age-related macular degeneration. There have been changes in the management of these&#xD;
      conditions over the last few years, with immunomodulatory agents and new intraocular delivery&#xD;
      systems. After the new trend of intravitreal corticosteroid and anti-VEGF, the new wave of&#xD;
      so-called biologic response modifiers, predominantly monoclonal antibodies directed against&#xD;
      inflammatory mediators or their receptors, but also some cytokines, represent a very&#xD;
      promising generation of immunomodulating agents. There is rising evidence that these biologic&#xD;
      drugs might be superior regarding their anti-inflammatory potential to conventional&#xD;
      immunosuppressive therapies. Unfortunately, these new drugs are also very expensive so far.&#xD;
      The yearly cost for a regular weight patient is around 20,000 dollars for Adalimumab or&#xD;
      Infliximab. Therefore, they may not be universally available in countries with poorly funded&#xD;
      health systems and for individuals with low economic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal injections of anti-VEGF and corticosteroids are currently the standard therapy&#xD;
      in a multitude of retinal diseases such as choroidal neovascularization, diabetic&#xD;
      maculopathy, proliferative diabetic retinopathy, and uveitis. However many patients respond&#xD;
      only partially or develop complications like corticosteroid induced glaucoma or cataract. As&#xD;
      such, we are looking for safe new therapies for various chorioretinal disorders aiming at&#xD;
      visual improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adalimumab (Humira) is a genetically engineered antibody against a proinflammatory cytokine,&#xD;
      namely, tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-α). Adalimumab is the first member of a new class of&#xD;
      TNF antibody compounds developed to contain exclusively human sequences. Adalimumab (ADA) is&#xD;
      a subcutaneously (SC) self-administered fully human Ig G1 monoclonal antibody directed&#xD;
      against tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) which will be used intravitreally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We do not know if adalimumab injections into the eye are effective and safe in most people.&#xD;
      We are performing this pilot study to determine its efficacy and safety in patients with&#xD;
      active vision threatening uveitis despite standard immunosuppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike infliximab, adalimumab contains no nonhuman sequences, making it indistinguishable in&#xD;
      structure and function from naturally occurring human IgG1. Unlike infliximab, allergic&#xD;
      reactions to adalimumab appear to be rare.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subcutaneous Adalimumab is currently used for the treatment of systemic inflammatory&#xD;
      conditions and inflammatory disease of the eye with a relatively favorable safety profile.&#xD;
      However, systemic administration carries the risk of systemic side effects, which in the case&#xD;
      of adalimumab can be severe, such as increased risk of infection, reactivation of&#xD;
      tuberculosis or increased risk for lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravitreal injection of Adalimumab The eye to be treated will be prepared with 5%&#xD;
      povidone-iodine solution after which 1% lidocaine will be administered as a subconjunctival&#xD;
      injection about 3 to 4 mm from the limbus to form a small bleb where the intravitreal&#xD;
      injection will be given. Following that, 0.03ml of adalimumab will be injected intravitreally&#xD;
      using a 30 gauge needle through the pars plana 3.5 mm from the limbus. Twenty minutes after&#xD;
      the injection, a paracentesis will be performed in case the intraocular pressure was greater&#xD;
      than 25 mmHg or if the optic nerve head was not adequately perfused. By the end of the&#xD;
      procedure, the eyes will be covered by a patch for one day after which topical antibiotics&#xD;
      (Ciloxan) will be applied 3 times per day for 3 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks Intravitreal adalimumab have never been tried but as any intravitreal&#xD;
      intervention, the risks of anti-VEGF therapy consist of local complications including&#xD;
      endophthalmitis (0.16% per injection), retinal detachment (0.08% per injection), cataract&#xD;
      (0.07% per injection), subconjuntival hemorrhage mainly related to the size of the needle&#xD;
      used, and uveitis (0.09% per injection). Systemic administration carries the risk of systemic&#xD;
      side effects, which in the case of adalimumab can be severe, such as increased risk of&#xD;
      infection, reactivation of tuberculosis or increased risk for lymphoma. However, because the&#xD;
      eye is a self contained organ relatively isolated from the systemic circulation by the tight&#xD;
      blood retinal barrier, it is unknown how much the amount of the drug injected intravitreally&#xD;
      gets reabsorbed systemically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-injection follow-up Patients will be examined every 3 weeks to measure the BCVA along&#xD;
      with slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment, dilated fundus examination, OCT, F.A, and&#xD;
      ERG. If any of the patients develops a decrease in visual acuity at least five letters of&#xD;
      vision post first injection, he/she will be shifted to the traditional treatment with&#xD;
      intravitreal avastin or intravitreal steroids. Else, if the vision is stable, patients will&#xD;
      continue treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total follow-up period of every patient will be 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main outcome Our goal is to study the efficacy and intraocular safety of intravitreal&#xD;
      adalimumab in the treatment of refractory CNV, DME, or uveitis and to ensure its rapid onset&#xD;
      of action. The main outcome measure will be the proportion of patients who lose fewer than 15&#xD;
      letters (3 lines) in BCVA score at 6 weeks compared with baseline. Secondary visual acuity&#xD;
      endpoints at 6 weeks include 1) mean change from baseline in BCVA score; 2) the proportion of&#xD;
      patients who gain ≥15 letters in BCVA; and 3) the proportion of patients with a Snellen&#xD;
      visual acuity of 20/70 or worse compared with baseline. Other secondary endpoints include the&#xD;
      effect of adalimumab on the central retinal thickness (CRT) as assessed by OCT and on the&#xD;
      lesion size assessed by F.A.&#xD;
