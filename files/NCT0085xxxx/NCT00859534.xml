  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urticaria is one of the most common dermatological conditions with diverse clinical&#xD;
      presentations and causes. Solar urticaria (SU) is a rare subset of physical urticaria, where&#xD;
      symptoms are induced by direct exposure of the skin to sunlight. As little as 5 minutes of&#xD;
      sun exposure can cause flares and whealing on exposed skin sites, accompanied by severe&#xD;
      itching. The wavelengths of radiation causing the eruption (i.e. the action spectrum) are in&#xD;
      the ultraviolet or visible light range. Initially described by Merklen in 1904, SU may have a&#xD;
      very sudden and dramatic onset, and then rapidly disappear once the exposure ceases. A&#xD;
      delayed form of SU has also been reported, although this is extremely rare. Information on&#xD;
      the pathophysiology of SU is limited and symptoms are confined to areas of the body exposed&#xD;
      to direct sunlight. The condition can be very distressing and severely impair the&#xD;
      individual's ability to go outdoors and to tolerate indoor lighting. The standard therapy,&#xD;
      i.e. oral antihistamines, is only partially effective and may provide little worthwhile&#xD;
      relief of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study is proposed to evaluate implants containing 16mg CUV1647 as a prophylactic&#xD;
      treatment for patients with SU. The effectiveness of CUV1647 will be assessed by determining&#xD;
      the minimum urticarial dose before and after treatment.&#xD;

      When human skin is exposed to ultraviolet radiation from the sun or via the use of solaria,&#xD;
      it responds by increasing melanin levels within epidermal melanocytes. Ultraviolet light&#xD;
      enhances the local production and release of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone&#xD;
      (alpha-MSH), which results in increased melanin levels through a process known as&#xD;
      melanogenesis. Melanin, in the form of eumelanin, is a photoprotective agent. The mechanisms&#xD;
      proposed for photoprotection include, but are not limited to, the absorption and scattering&#xD;
      of UV and visible radiation, free radical scavenging and quenching of UV light. There is also&#xD;
      increasing evidence that melanogenesis represents a major antioxidant defence mechanism in&#xD;
      melanocytes, neutralising the deleterious effects of free radicals and active oxygen species.&#xD;
      Eumelanin acts as a neutral density filter and, unlike most sunscreens, reduces all&#xD;
      wavelengths of light equally so that the photoprotection provided by epidermal melanin&#xD;
      pigmentation is essentially independent of wavelength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CUV1647 ([Nle4-D-Phe7]-alpha-MSH) is a potent and longer lasting analogue of alpha-MSH which&#xD;
      stimulates the production of eumelanin in the skin without the specific cell damage that&#xD;
      usually occurs when melanin production is stimulated by UV radiation.&#xD;
