      This is an observational study aiming to study the prevalence and risk factors for&#xD;
      osteoporosis and vertebral fractures in patients with ankylosing spondylitis attending three&#xD;
      Rheumatology clinics in Western Sweden.&#xD;

      Background Ankylosing spondylitis (AS) is a common inflammatory rheumatic disease with a&#xD;
      prevalence of 0.5-1.0%. Men are more commonly affected by the disease as compared to women,&#xD;
      ratio 2.6-4:1. Pain in the back is a frequent symptom of debut. This pain is often associated&#xD;
      with sacroilitis. In later stages also the lumbar, thoracic and cervical spine are hit by the&#xD;
      disease. Peripheral joints, eyes, heart, lungs and urinary tract may also be influenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoporosis in AS In AS the risk of osteoporosis is increased. However, this field has not&#xD;
      yet been significantly studied probably due to several reasons such as the predominance of&#xD;
      men with the disease and men are more seldom investigated for osteoporosis compared to women.&#xD;
      When AS progresses syndesmophytes of the spine are developed which makes it difficult to&#xD;
      assess bone mineral density (BMD) correctly with the conventional method, dual energy x-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DXA). Fractures in the spine are easy to foreseen since the pain of the&#xD;
      patient might be misjudged to be related to increased disease activity. Fractures are also&#xD;
      overlooked in radiographs in AS. AS is associated with both increased bone formation and&#xD;
      increased bone resorption. The bone remodeling process in the spine renders the spine less&#xD;
      flexible and stiffer and as a consequence also a quite small trauma may result in a fracture.&#xD;
      These fractures are often instable risking injuring the spinal cord and nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the prevalence of osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures in&#xD;
           patients with AS in Western Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify risk factors for osteoporosis and osteoporosis related fractures in AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study how fractures in the spine may influence the pain in the back, the flexibility&#xD;
           of the spine and the posture of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study to which extent the patients with AS are investigated and treated for&#xD;
           osteoporosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate which method is most reliable for measuring BMD in AS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods This is an observational study consisting of questionnaires, examination&#xD;
      of the patients, blood tests, measures of BMD with different techniques, DXA, both&#xD;
      frontal-dorsal and lateral projections, Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) and Xtreme CT.&#xD;
      Patients with AS from three rheumatology clinics in western Sweden with definite AS will be&#xD;
      invited to participate. It is estimated that about 250 patients will be included in the&#xD;
      trial. All patients gave informed written consent according to the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the Regional Ethics Committee.&#xD;
