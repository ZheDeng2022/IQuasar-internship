  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart disease is the most common cause of death in the United States and it is commonly found&#xD;
      in people with diabetes and high cholesterol. Inflammation is one mechanism by which diabetes&#xD;
      and elevated cholesterol damage blood vessels. Inflammation can be increased by oxidative&#xD;
      stress. This study will see if Alpha Lipoic acid, a potent antioxidant and over the counter&#xD;
      product, reduces blood levels of markers of oxidative stress and inflammation when compared&#xD;
      with placebo. Placebo is a substance that looks like the real product, but contains no active&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized study. A randomized study means you will be assigned by chance (like the&#xD;
      toss of a coin) to one of four groups and receive either alpha lipoic acid (ALA or placebo&#xD;
      (an inactive substance that looks like the real drug). In this study, there is a 1 out of 4&#xD;
      chance you will receive placebo. Three of the groups will receive different doses of ALA and&#xD;
      one group will receive placebo only. The groups are: placebo only, 600 mg ALA, 1200 mg ALA,&#xD;
      and 1800 mg ALA a day. At some point all study participants will receive placebo; sometimes&#xD;
      the pills will be ALA and sometimes they will be placebo. You will not know which you are&#xD;
      taking on any given day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is also double-blinded, which means that you, the study doctor, and the Sponsor&#xD;
      will not know until the end of the study whether you are receiving ALA or placebo only. Your&#xD;
      study doctor can find out if you are receiving ALA or placebo if needed in an emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you agree to be in this study, you will be asked to come in for up to 6 visits in 12&#xD;
      weeks. You should be fasting before some of these visits. Fasting means that you should have&#xD;
      nothing to eat or drink, except water with your usual morning medications, for 10 hours&#xD;
      before your scheduled study visit. The study staff will go over this with you each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1-Screening: (about 3 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Please fast before this visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to find out if you qualify to take part in the study, you will have the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures done during this visit including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your health history will be taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your height, weight, and blood pressure will be measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will give fasting blood samples of about 3-5 tablespoons and urine samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are female and can have children, you will be given a urine pregnancy test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take a glucose tolerance test (GTT) A dietitian will briefly discuss your diet&#xD;
           and exercise. An ECG will be done to measure your heart function. ECG measures the&#xD;
           electrical activity of your heart. You will be asked to lie down and small sticky pads&#xD;
           will be placed on your arms, legs, and across your chest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GTT test involves collecting 1 blood sample before, and 4 samples up to 2 hours after,&#xD;
      you drink a measured amount of glucose (a sugar) in a pleasant tasting liquid. You will have&#xD;
      2 tablespoons of blood drawn. An indwelling intravenous (IV) needle will be inserted into&#xD;
      your vein for the 2-hour period so that individual needle sticks will not be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the results of your blood and urine tests, you may be asked to come in for a&#xD;
      second visit in about 1 week. The screening blood tests may provide you with information on&#xD;
      your health that could be important to you, for example diagnosing diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 2: (about 1 hour)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • You do not have to fast for this visit and may take your morning medications as usual&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have the following tests and procedures done during this visit including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - You will meet with a dietician for an assessment of your eating habits. The dietitian will&#xD;
      advise you on how to maintain a stable diet during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your blood tests indicate that you have diabetes, you will receive instructions on&#xD;
           diet and exercise to improve your blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your HbA1c level is high, you will be given a home glucose monitoring device&#xD;
           (glucometer) with instructions on its use for daily testing. HbA1c is a measure of&#xD;
           average glucose levels over the prior few weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be given a 2-week supply of study drug and asked to stop any over- the-counter&#xD;
           vitamins that you are taking until you have completed this study. We will provide 3&#xD;
           bottles of study medicine at a time. Each bottle will be uniquely identified for use in&#xD;
           the morning, midday or evening. You will be asked to take 2 tablets from the morning&#xD;
           bottle, then 2 from the midday bottle and 2 from the evening bottle. You will also be&#xD;
           given a daily multivitamin to take. This will be a total of 7 tablets a day for 10&#xD;
           weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All unused study drug should be returned when you come in for the next visit in 2 weeks. It&#xD;
      is important that you are able to take all the study drug. If we find that you are unable to&#xD;
      take most of the study drug, you will be removed from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VISIT 3: (about 6-8 hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
      •&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Please be fasting and do not have alcohol or exercise for 48 hours prior to the visit.&#xD;
           You may be asked to withhold some of your usual medicines on this day but bring the&#xD;
           doses to the visit with you to be taken at a later time. You will have the following&#xD;
           tests and procedures done during this visit including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachial artery ultrasound: This is a way to see how the walls of your arteries respond&#xD;
           to change in blood flow. For this test, you will lie on a bed and we will take sound&#xD;
           wave pictures of the artery in your elbow area. After the initial pictures, we will then&#xD;
           inflate a blood pressure cuff on your upper arm for 5 minutes. As soon as the cuff is&#xD;
           deflated more pictures of the same artery are taken. We will give then give you a pill&#xD;
           called nitroglycerine to dissolve under your tongue. When the pill dissolves in a few&#xD;
           minutes, final pictures of the same artery will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The brachial test will be repeated 2 hours after a high fat meal is eaten. We will give&#xD;
           the meal to you It will contain known amounts of fat,carbohydrates, and protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Augmentation index: This is a test to see how stiff the walls of your artery may be. A&#xD;
           small microphone will record the signal from the artery in your wrist for about 5&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Several samples of blood (2 tablespoons) will be taken before you eat the high fat meal&#xD;
           and when the second brachial test is completed. An indwelling IV needle may be inserted&#xD;
           into your vein during this period so that individual needle sticks will not be needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan. DEXA is a 4-5 minute x-ray body scan that provides accurate body fat mass&#xD;
           measurements.If you are a woman who can have children, you will have a urine pregnancy&#xD;
           test. If you are pregnant you will NOT be able to have the DEXA scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A dietician will assist you with food questionnaire about your usual diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 4-week supply of study drug will be given to you with instructions on how to take it.&#xD;
           Please bring any remaining study drug bottles with you to your next visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: telephone call. You will also be asked about your ability and willingness to&#xD;
      continue to take the study medicine until the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also ask if you are having any new symptoms that may indicate low blood sugar such as&#xD;
      hunger, shakiness, dizziness, confusion, difficulty speaking, feeling anxious or weak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You should notify the study team at any time by telephone to report these symptoms. You may&#xD;
      be asked to come in for an extra visit if these are occurring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits 5(day 1 and 2 final visits): (about 4 hours each day for 2 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Please be fasting and do not have alcohol or exercise for 48 hours prior to these visits.&#xD;
      You may be asked to withhold some of your usual medicines on both days but bring the doses to&#xD;
      the visit with you to take at a later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These 2 visits may be done on 2 consecutive mornings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have a brachial artery ultrasound with nitroglycerine, a DEXA scan, a 2 hour GTT&#xD;
      blood test with an indwelling IV needle in your vein, height, weight, blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - If you are a woman who can have children, you will be given a urine pregnancy test. If you&#xD;
      are pregnant, you will NOT be able to have the DEXA scan that is part of this visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5 day 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      The brachial ultrasound will be repeated after a high fat meal is eaten which is provided by&#xD;
      the study center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will have blood samples taken before and after the test and you will also meet with a&#xD;
      dietitian for a final food questionnaire.&#xD;
