    <textblock>
      This is a Two-part Pilot Study: Part 1 is descriptive and Part 2 is a pilot randomized trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1 will be a formative study in which individual interviews are conducted with 20&#xD;
      patients previously diagnosed with colorectal cancer. During open-ended interviews,&#xD;
      researchers will collect data on QOL issues colorectal cancer patients face and will elicit&#xD;
      feedback regarding development of and participation in a pilot expressive disclosure&#xD;
      intervention. Patients also will pilot test an assessment procedures including completing the&#xD;
      written questionnaires and wearing the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 will include a small randomized pilot test in which 44 patients (two cohorts of 22&#xD;
      patients) will be randomly assigned to the Expressive Disclosure Group Program or a Standard&#xD;
      Care Control Group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims of the study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct a descriptive study of colorectal cancer patients, through qualitative&#xD;
           interviews and standardized questionnaires, in an effort to assess their QOL, specific&#xD;
           health and emotional problems, issues related to social functioning, and preferences&#xD;
           regarding intervention format and logistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To use the information from the descriptive study to develop an Expressive Disclosure&#xD;
           Group Program for colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To pilot test a novel technology called the Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) for&#xD;
           assessing cognitive processing and social support in colorectal cancer patients and&#xD;
           compare these data to those obtained with traditional self-report measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To pilot test the Expressive Disclosure Group Program and conduct process evaluation&#xD;
           including rates of recruitment and retention, attendance, satisfaction, barriers to&#xD;
           participation, and feasibility of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the effects of the Expressive Disclosure Group Program on outcome variables&#xD;
           of QOL and psychological functioning and mediating variables of cognitive processing,&#xD;
           coping skills, and social support.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Colon and rectal cancer patients will be asked to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will include three tasks:&#xD;
&#xD;
      First, you will participate in individual interviews during which questions about quality of&#xD;
      life will be asked. You also will be provided information about a new expressive disclosure&#xD;
      group program for colon and rectal cancer patients, after which you will be asked your&#xD;
      opinions about the program. The entire individual interview will last 30 minutes to 1 hour.&#xD;
      The interviews will be audiotaped, and then the study staff will make a written copy of the&#xD;
      answers given on the tapes to be used in analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, you will be asked to complete questionnaires about your medical history, quality of&#xD;
      life, mood, thought processes, coping style, and social support. It will take about 1 hour to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, you will be asked to wear an Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) for two days in a&#xD;
      row. The EAR is a recording system consisting of a digital tape-recorder and a small external&#xD;
      microphone. The EAR is programmed to record for 30 seconds at a time, and then is off for 12&#xD;
      minutes. It repeats this 12.5 minute cycle the entire time while worn for two days. The&#xD;
      recordings from the EAR will provide information about your daily activities. The study staff&#xD;
      will make a written copy of what is said on the recordings for analysis. Before returning the&#xD;
      EAR device, you will be given the opportunity to schedule an appointment where you can listen&#xD;
      to the recordings and erase any portion that you think is embarrassing or private. If&#xD;
      participants have no concerns about the EAR recordings, the EAR can be returned in a prepaid&#xD;
      mailing packet. After wearing the EAR, you will complete an evaluation questionnaire over the&#xD;
      phone, which will take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. A total of 25 colon and rectal cancer patients will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in this study. Participants will be from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center and&#xD;
      Kelsey-Seybold Clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will first be asked to complete a brief questionnaire about your mood. If the answers to&#xD;
      the questionnaire indicate that you are distressed, you will be eligible for the remainder of&#xD;
      the study. Only those participants who score as distressed will stay in the study. Regardless&#xD;
      of your answers, you will be informed of your test results and provided with a list of&#xD;
      community referrals. If your responses to the questionnaire indicate potential harm to&#xD;
      yourself, a licensed psychologist will follow-up with you and make recommendations, which may&#xD;
      include mental health referrals at M.D. Anderson and/or in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the first questionnaire indicates that you are distressed, you will be asked to complete&#xD;
      additional questionnaires about your medical history, quality of life, mood, thought&#xD;
      processes, coping style and social support. It will take about 1 hour to complete the&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You also will be asked to wear an Electronically Activated Recorder (EAR) for two days in a&#xD;
      row. The EAR is a recording system consisting of a digital tape-recorder and a small external&#xD;
      microphone. The EAR is programmed to record for 30 seconds at a time, and then is off for 12&#xD;
      minutes. It repeats this 12.5 minute cycle the entire time while worn for two days. The&#xD;
      recordings from the EAR will provide information about your daily activities. The study staff&#xD;
      will make a written copy of what is said on the recordings for analysis. Before returning the&#xD;
      EAR device, you will be given the opportunity to schedule an appointment where you can listen&#xD;
      to the recordings and erase any portion that you think is embarrassing or private. If&#xD;
      participants have no concerns about the EAR recordings, the EAR can be returned in a prepaid&#xD;
      mailing packet. After wearing the EAR, you will complete an evaluation questionnaire over the&#xD;
      phone, which will take about 5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete the questionnaires when you enter the study, 2 months after entering the&#xD;
      study, and 4 months after entering the study. You also will be asked to wear the EAR for 2&#xD;
      days when you enter the study, and for 2 days at 4 months after entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be assigned randomly (as in the toss of a coin) to one of two programs: the&#xD;
      Expressive Disclosure Group Program or the Standard Care Program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Expressive Disclosure Group Program will attend groups with about 11 members.&#xD;
      The program will include 12 group meetings over the course of 4months: 9 weekly meetings, 2&#xD;
      semi-monthly (twice a month) meetings, and a final meeting in month 4. Each meeting will last&#xD;
      1 hour. This program will involve talking and writing about several topics that are important&#xD;
      for individuals facing colon and rectal cancer. Participants in this program also will&#xD;
      receive written educational material and information about community resources. Group&#xD;
      meetings will be audio-taped. Copies of tapes will be provided to participants when they miss&#xD;
      a session. Tapes will sometimes be reviewed by project investigators to make sure the groups&#xD;
      are covering the program content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the Standard Care Program will not attend any formal group meetings. They will&#xD;
      receive by mail written educational material and information about community resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. A total of 149 individuals diagnosed with colon or rectal&#xD;
      cancer will take part in this study: 131 from M. D. Anderson and 18 from Kelsey-Seybold&#xD;
      Clinics.&#xD;
