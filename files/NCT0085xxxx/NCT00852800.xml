  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is a common and severe complication of cirrhosis. The&#xD;
      most serious complication of SBP is the hepatorenal syndrome (HRS), which occurs in up to 30&#xD;
      percent of patients, with high mortality. Intravenous albumin (1.5 g/kg at diagnosis and 1&#xD;
      g/kg 48 hours later - standard regimen) helps to prevent HRS and improves survival. No&#xD;
      information exists on the efficacy of lower doses of albumin. This study was designed to&#xD;
      allow direct comparison among different doses of intravenous albumin in patients with SBP -&#xD;
      standard (SR) vs dose reduced regimen (DRR) - in order to prevent renal failure and&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;

      Patients with cirrhosis who had spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) and who are admitted&#xD;
      from March 2006 to a single university hospital were evaluated for inclusion in the study.&#xD;
      The study was approved by the investigational review boar, and patients gave written informed&#xD;
      consent to participate. Inclusion criteria were a cytological diagnosis of SBP, in the&#xD;
      absence of findings suggestive of secondary peritonitis; age between 18 and 80 years; no&#xD;
      antibiotic treatment within one week before the diagnosis of spontaneous bacterial&#xD;
      peritonitis (except for prophylactic treatment with norfloxacin or&#xD;
      trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole); the absence of other infections, shock, gastrointestinal&#xD;
      bleeding, grade 3 or 4 hepatic encephalopathy, cardiac failure, and any disease (e.g.,&#xD;
      advanced neoplasia) that could affect the short term prognosis; a serum creatinine level of&#xD;
      no more than 3 mg per deciliter 265 Âµmol per liter); and the absence of potential causes of&#xD;
      dehydration (such as diarrhea or an intense response to diuretic treatment) within one week&#xD;
      before the diagnosis of peritonitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly assigned to one of two groups: standard regimen (SR) vs dose reduced&#xD;
      regimen (DRR). Randomization was performed independently with the use of sealed envelopes&#xD;
      containing the treatment assignments, which were based on random numbers generated by&#xD;
      computer. All the investigators were unaware of the treatment assignments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical examination and routine laboratory tests (blood-cell counts and liver and renal&#xD;
      tests) and measurement of plasma rennin activity were performed on day 1 of therapy in all&#xD;
      patients. Laboratory measurements were repeated every three days until discharge. Rennin&#xD;
      activity was repeated on day 7. Intravenous cefotaxime was given daily in doses that varied&#xD;
      accordingly to creatinine. Albumin was given at a dose of 1.5 or 1 g per kilogram of body&#xD;
      weight on day 1, followed by 1 or 0.5 g per kilogram on day 3 (SR vs DRR). Albumin was&#xD;
      diluted in saline solution until total volume of 1000 ml on day 1 and 500 ml on day 3.&#xD;
      Albumin was prepared in a bottle with same color, volume and aspect in both groups. Diuretic&#xD;
      treatment was not give until day 5 of treatment and therapeutic paracentesis &gt; 3 liters was&#xD;
      not allowed until the infection had resolved. Response to cefotaxime was considered when the&#xD;
      polymorphonuclear-cell count in ascitic fluid reduced by at least 50%. Antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      was modified when no response to cefotaxim occurred according to the in vitro susceptibility&#xD;
      of the isolated organism or was modified empirically in patients with negative blood and&#xD;
      ascitic-fluid cultures. Prophylactic norfloxacin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole therapy was&#xD;
      initiated after the resolution of infection and was maintained throughout the follow-up&#xD;
      period. Renal failure at the time of enrollment was diagnosed when the serum creatinine level&#xD;
      was more than 1.5 mg per deciliter. Renal impairment was defined as a nonreversible&#xD;
      deterioration of renal function during hospitalization. In patients without renal failure at&#xD;
      enrollment, renal impairment was diagnosed when serum creatinine level increased by more than&#xD;
      50 percent of the pretreatment value, to level higher than 1.5 mg per deciliter. In patients&#xD;
      with preexisting renal failure, an increase in serum creatinine level by more than 50 percent&#xD;
      from base line was required for a diagnosis of renal impairment. After the resolution of&#xD;
      infection, patients with tense ascites were treated with total paracentesis and the&#xD;
      administration of albumin, regardless of treatment assignment, followed by sodium restriction&#xD;
      and diuretic therapy, and those with moderate ascites were treated only with sodium&#xD;
      restriction and diuretics. After discharge from the hospital, patients were followed until 90&#xD;
      days after enrollment.&#xD;
