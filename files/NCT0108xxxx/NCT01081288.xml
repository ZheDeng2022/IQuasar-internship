      Nationwide cluster-randomised trial of extending the NHS breast screening age range in&#xD;
      England&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 1988, the national Breast Screening Programme (BSP) began offering women aged 50-64 years&#xD;
      triennial mammographic screening and full national coverage was achieved by the mid-1990s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2003, the age range for triennial screening was extended from 50-64 to 50-70 years;&#xD;
      proposals from committees in the Department of Health to randomise this age extension and&#xD;
      thereby to obtain reliable information on both the risks and benefits of additional screening&#xD;
      at ages 65-70 were not adopted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, 80 breast screening units cover all of England, each responsible for a defined&#xD;
      area, and each year they invite about 2.8 million women aged 50-70, with 2.0 million&#xD;
      accepting. The BSP sets standards for the screening units and monitors performance through&#xD;
      its national quality assurance network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2007, the Prime Minister announced plans for eventual extension to the range 47-73 years.&#xD;
      This offered another opportunity to obtain reliable evidence about the effects of extending&#xD;
      the age range of triennial screening. Hence, a trial of this age extension has begun, in&#xD;
      which only half are offered extra screening, with the effects monitored through routinely&#xD;
      collected NHS statistics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a 2009-10 pilot study of the acceptability of cluster-randomisation of additional&#xD;
      screening at ages 47-49 and 71-73 in 5 breast screening units, the AgeX trial extended&#xD;
      recruitment to about five-sixths of the breast screening clinics in England, and this&#xD;
      cluster-randomisation continues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2011, the Government deferred the earliest possible date when screening would be extended&#xD;
      to all women aged 47-73. Later, Public Health England (PHE, which is responsible for&#xD;
      government screening programmes) stated that final decisions about extension of the age range&#xD;
      would await the emergence of reliable evidence of its effects. The AgeX trial will eventually&#xD;
      provide this.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2012, an independent panel set up by the Department of Health and the charity Cancer&#xD;
      Research UK reported &quot;The UK breast screening programmes [at ages 50-70] confer significant&#xD;
      benefit and should continue…. The impact of breast screening outside the ages 50-69 years is&#xD;
      very uncertain. The Panel supports the principle of the ongoing trial in the UK [AgeX] for&#xD;
      randomising women under age 50 and above age 70 to be invited for breast screening&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Meanwhile, as female life expectancy is increasing, interest has grown in the possible&#xD;
      advantages of continuing to screen women not just in their early 70s but throughout their&#xD;
      70s. The advantages and the disadvantages of continuing triennial screening after age 70&#xD;
      would be seen more clearly in a trial of 2 or 3 additional invitations (covering ages 71-76&#xD;
      or 71-79) than in a trial of just one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2013 the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Breast Cancer in Older Women (APPG) said &quot;Women&#xD;
      are not routinely invited for breast screening past the age of 70 … the current 'age&#xD;
      extension trial' [of screening past age 70] … should be extended past 73 to 76, and, if&#xD;
      appropriate … further extended&quot;. In a separate report in 2015 the APPG reiterated this&#xD;
      conclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although AgeX began as a trial of additional screening at ages 47-49 and at ages 71-73, it&#xD;
      has therefore become a trial in which the older women allocated additional screening can,&#xD;
      where resources are available, continue be invited triennially at ages 71-76 or at ages&#xD;
      71-79, thereby assessing the effects of continuing triennial screening for several years&#xD;
      after age 70.&#xD;
