  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to determine the safety and maximum tolerated dose of a drug, OXi4503&#xD;
      (combretastatin A1 diphosphate, CA1P, OXiGENE), in patients with relapsed and refractory AML&#xD;
      and MDS.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite initial disease remissions with cytotoxic chemotherapies, patients with AML and MDS&#xD;
      often relapse and die of their disease. Novel strategies for targeting dependent pathways are&#xD;
      needed. AML and MDS depend on blood vessels for survival and proliferation. OXi4503 is a&#xD;
      novel microtubule targeting agent that selectively destroys cancer-associated blood vessels,&#xD;
      induces cancer cell apoptosis via an ortho-quinone moiety and results in significant&#xD;
      regressions of solid tumors. OXi4503 is currently being tested in phase I clinical trials of&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors. In preclinical studies with human AML, OXi4503 was cytotoxic to&#xD;
      leukemia cells, decreased size of chloromas, regressed leukemic cell engraftment in bone&#xD;
      marrow and brought about phenotypic and molecular remissions. Given these results, we&#xD;
      hypothesize that OXi4503 has disease remitting effects in myeloid malignancies such as AML&#xD;
      and MDS. Before evaluating efficacy, safety and maximum tolerated dose of OXi4503 will be&#xD;
      defined in AML and MDS patients. In addition, assessments of pharmacokinetic (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PD) parameters will be made, and relationships between dose and biologic&#xD;
      activity will be defined. Results from this trial will provide new clinical data and biologic&#xD;
      insight regarding the effects of OXi4503 in AML and MDS, and will serve as the basis for&#xD;
      future efficacy trials.&#xD;

    <description>Two safety cohorts treating two (2) patients at a dose of 2.5 mg/m2 followed by two patients at 3.75 mg/m2 will be completed prior to beginning at the dose level of 5 mg/m2.&#xD;
Dosing of OXi4503 will be an intravenous infusion (IV) over 10 minutes on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each 28 day cycle.&#xD;
Dose escalations and de-escalations of 25% will be made until the maximum tolerated dose is reached.&#xD;
Number of cycles: After Cycle 1, subjects who achieve stable disease (SD) or greater response may continue to receive additional cycles of treatment until either disease progression (defined as greater than 25% increase in leukemia myeloblasts in the bone marrow compared to baseline examination) or unacceptable toxicity due to the investigational agent.</description>
