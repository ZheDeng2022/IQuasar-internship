  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we will test, using a randomized controlled trial design, whether the use of a&#xD;
      computer-based decision aid (DA) may improve general knowledge and reduce personal decisional&#xD;
      conflict in patients with early stage papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), when compared to usual&#xD;
      care. Patients with early stage PTC will be required to have surgical pathologic criteria for&#xD;
      which adjuvant RAI treatment may be considered optional.&#xD;
    </textblock>

      A. Primary research question&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with early stage papillary thyroid cancer, does the administration of a&#xD;
      computerized decision aid improve the score on a test of knowledge about early stage PTC and&#xD;
      adjuvant RAI treatment, when compared to usual care? (The knowledge score is a sum of&#xD;
      positive responses from a total of 10 true/false questions in a self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire, to be administered at the study visit, Q2A).&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Secondary research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In patients with early stage PTC, does the administration of a computerized decision aid&#xD;
           reduce overall decisional conflict (as well as the following respective subscales -&#xD;
           informed subscale, uncertainty subscale, and effective decision subscale), when compared&#xD;
           to usual care? (Decisional Conflict questionnaire, DCS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In patients with early stage PTC, does the administration of a computerized decision&#xD;
           aid, improve reduce decisional regret relating to RAI decision making after the final&#xD;
           decision has been made? (Decision Regret Questionnaire, DRQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In patients with early stage PTC, does the administration of a computerized decision&#xD;
           aid, reduce the number of participants receiving adjuvant radioactive iodine treatment&#xD;
           (analysis for all participants, as well as those who are not already on a waiting list&#xD;
           for radioactive iodine treatment at the time of recruitment, respectively)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Do the respective monitoring or blunting scores on the Miller Behavioral Style Scale&#xD;
           (MBSS) correlate with the number of clicks for information performed by participants&#xD;
           reviewing the decision aid? (subgroup analysis in the decision aid intervention group)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Do the respective monitoring or blunting scores on the Miller Behavioral Style Scale&#xD;
           (MBSS) correlate with the score on a test of knowledge about early stage PTC and&#xD;
           adjuvant RAI treatment? (Respective analyses planned for entire study population, as&#xD;
           well as the intervention and control groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. What are the main reasons why RAI treatment is selected or not selected (after the&#xD;
           decision has been finalized), grouping descriptions according to exposure or&#xD;
           non-exposure to a computerized decision aid? (See Follow-up questionnaire [administered&#xD;
           by telephone], question 2, qualitative description, with reasons to be coded and&#xD;
           quantified using mixed methods).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: In the original design of this study, we hoped to utilize a modified Client&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaire for assessment of satisfaction of patient participants and&#xD;
      physicians as secondary trial outcomes. However, we are unable to utilize any modified Client&#xD;
      Satisfaction Questionnaires in this study, because of lack of permission from the original&#xD;
      developer of the Client Satisfaction Questionnaire-8, who has copyrighted and trademarked the&#xD;
      questionnaire and prohibits such modifications. No modified client satisfaction questionnaire&#xD;
      results have been analyzed in this study and will not be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design The project design will be a single-centre randomized controlled trial conducted&#xD;
      at University Health Network. The participants will be randomized to a) the decision aid&#xD;
      group (in addition to usual care [counseling by his or her physician, called usual care]) or&#xD;
      b) usual care. The DA will be available only to participants during the study (not the public&#xD;
      or treating physicians). The decision aid testing will be performed at the Toronto General&#xD;
      Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15-23 Month Extended Follow-up Study: After initiation of the primary study above, we were&#xD;
      subsequently awarded funding to contact the enrolled study participants about 15 and 23&#xD;
      months post-randomization to inquire for permission to participate in an extended follow-up&#xD;
      study. The extended follow-up study was approved by the University Health Network Research&#xD;
      Ethics Board. Participants from the original randomized controlled trial (above) are&#xD;
      contacted by telephone for consent to participate in the extended follow-up study, which is&#xD;
      considered exploratory (secondary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extended follow-up study includes a quantitative questionnaire telephone interview&#xD;
      component and a qualitative component. For the quantitative questionnaire component, a single&#xD;
      telephone interview is performed updating demographics, thyroid cancer outcomes/treatments&#xD;
      (with confirmatory medical record review and administering quantitative questionnaires&#xD;
      verbally. A participants consenting to the extended follow-up study are also offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to participate in an in-depth qualitative study, involving a one-on in-person&#xD;
      interview (which is audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative methods). A&#xD;
      representative subgroup of about 15-30 participants are invited in the qualitative interview&#xD;
      and sampling continued until saturation of themes is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exploratory questions are to be addressed in the quantitative component of the&#xD;
      extended follow-up study (about 15-23 months post-randomization):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To what degree do participants in the study (decision aid and control groups) perceive&#xD;
           themselves to be respectively informed and satisfied with the original radioactive&#xD;
           iodine treatment decision? The results in respective study arms are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To what degree do participants in the study (decision aid and control groups) perceive&#xD;
           themselves to regret their original radioactive iodine treatment decision? The results&#xD;
           in respective study arms are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To what degree do participants in the study (decision aid and control groups) perceive&#xD;
           current cancer-related worry (Assessment of Survivor Concerns Questionnaires)? The&#xD;
           results in respective study arms are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To what degree do participants in the study (decision aid and control groups) perceive&#xD;
           trust in their treating physician (Trust in Physician Scale)? The results in respective&#xD;
           study arms are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How do participants in the study (decision aid and control groups) perceive their mood&#xD;
           (PHQ-4 questionnaire)? The results in respective study arms are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The qualitative subgroup study includes semi-structured questions on the experiences of&#xD;
      radioactive iodine treatment decision-making, overall thyroid cancer treatment satisfaction,&#xD;
      and study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Telephone Survey Study - 24 months or longer after randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initiation of the primary study above, we were subsequently awarded pilot study funding&#xD;
      to contact the study participants on one occasion, two or more years post-randomization to&#xD;
      inquire for permission to participate in an exploratory telephone survey study, intended to&#xD;
      guide future research directions, and generate data for possible use in sample size&#xD;
      calculations for potential future studies. The 24 month or longer post-randomization&#xD;
      exploratory telephone survey study was approved by the University Health Network Research&#xD;
      Ethics Board. Participants from the original randomized controlled trial (above) are&#xD;
      contacted by telephone for consent to participate in the study, which is considered&#xD;
      exploratory (secondary) and is thus, hypothesis-generating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The telephone survey exploratory study (2 or more years post-randomization) consists of&#xD;
      quantitative telephone questionnaires. A single telephone interview is performed updating&#xD;
      demographics, thyroid cancer outcomes/treatments (with confirmatory medical record review and&#xD;
      administering quantitative questionnaires verbally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exploratory questions are to be addressed in the exploratory 24 month (or&#xD;
      longer) post-randomization study. For all of the analyses below, descriptive data will be&#xD;
      described for the entire study population, and if sample size permits, subgroup analyses&#xD;
      according to decision aid status, radioactive iodine status, and age (&lt;45 years at time of&#xD;
      original surgery or 45 years or older at time of original surgery), and recurrence status,&#xD;
      will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe the Cancer Impact in consenting participants, 2 or more years&#xD;
           post-randomization. For participants in whom a negative financial impact of cancer is&#xD;
           reported, an additional question is posed requesting explanation of this impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the Information Needs of consenting participants, 2 or more years&#xD;
           post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the General Concerns of consenting participants, 2 or more years&#xD;
           post-randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe cancer-related worry (Assessment of Survivor Concerns Questionnaires) two or&#xD;
           more years following randomization.&#xD;
