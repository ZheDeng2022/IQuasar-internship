      A study to see how a single subcutaneous dose of Epoetin beta (NeoRecormon®) in healthy&#xD;
      Japanese compares with a single subcutaneous dose of Epoetin beta (NeoRecormon®) in Caucasian&#xD;
      Male subjects. Each subject received a single subcutaneous dose of 50IU/kg of NeoRecormon&#xD;
      Multidose solution on Day 1.&#xD;

      Ethnic comparison studies are becoming common research requirements in order to identify&#xD;
      differences in response to drugs in various ethnic populations. This study will investigate&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetic parameters and pharmacodynamic response in healthy Caucasian and Japanese&#xD;
      male subjects after a single subcutaneous administration of 50IU/kg Epoetin beta&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I single centre, open label trial to investigate the bioequivalence of a&#xD;
      single subcutaneous dose of Epoetin beta (NeoRecormon®) in healthy Japanese and Caucasian&#xD;
      Male subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives are 1) to establish the pharmacokinetic parameters of Epoetin beta in&#xD;
      healthy Japanese and Caucasian males, and 2) to compare the pharmacokinetic parameters AUCinf&#xD;
      and Cmax in healthy Japanese and Caucasian males. The secondary objective is to establish the&#xD;
      pharmacodynamic parameters of a single dose of Epoetin beta in healthy Japanese and Caucasian&#xD;
      males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single subcutaneous administration of 50IU/kg on one occasion only.&#xD;
      The planned study duration is approximately 1 month.&#xD;
