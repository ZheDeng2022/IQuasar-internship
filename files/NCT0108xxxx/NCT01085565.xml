      The goal of this prospective, non-randomized, single-arm, phase 2 study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of this treatment using this ExAblate conformal system in the&#xD;
      treatment of pain resulting from metastatic bone tumors Up to Fifty (50) patients will be&#xD;
      recruited in this feasibility study. The treated patients will be followed for 3-Months post&#xD;
      their last treatment, patients with the standard contraindications to MRI examination, such&#xD;
      as implanted metal devices (pacemakers, etc.), will be excluded.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Bone is the third most common organ involved by metastatic disease behind lung and liver [6].&#xD;
      In breast cancer, bone is the second most common site of metastatic spread, and 90% of&#xD;
      patients dying of breast cancer have bone metastasis. Breast and prostate cancer metastasize&#xD;
      to bone most frequently, which reflects the high incidence of both these tumors, as well as&#xD;
      their prolonged clinical courses. Post-cancer survival has increased with improvement in&#xD;
      early detection and treatments. As a consequence, the number of patients developing&#xD;
      metastatic bone disease during their lifetime has also increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatments for patients with bone metastases are primarily palliative and include&#xD;
      localized therapies (radiation and surgery), systemic therapies (chemotherapy, hormonal&#xD;
      therapy, radiopharmaceutical, and bisphosphonates although the primary goal of the use of&#xD;
      these therapies are often to address the disease itself), and analgesics (opioids and&#xD;
      non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs). Recently, radiofrequency ablation has been tested as&#xD;
      a treatment option for bone metastases [8]. Currently, an off label use of Cryoablation&#xD;
      techniques are being tested as another alternative for bone Mets palliation. The main goals&#xD;
      of these treatments are improvement of quality of life and functional level. These goals can&#xD;
      be further described:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pain relief&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preservation and restoration of function&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Local tumor control&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Skeletal stabilization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) is the standard of care for patients&#xD;
      with localized bone pain, and results in the palliation of pain for many of these patients.&#xD;
      Twenty to 30% of patients treated with radiation therapy do not experience pain relief&#xD;
      [9-13]. Re-treatment rates are generally reported in the range of 10-25%. Many patients with&#xD;
      relapsed pain or poor response to initial radiation may be lost to follow up or may not be&#xD;
      referred back to oncologists for consideration of re-radiation. In addition to relapse and&#xD;
      re-treatment, there is an increased risk of pathologic fracture in the peri-radiation period.&#xD;
      The fracture rate reported in radiation studies is generally in the range of 1% to 8%. The&#xD;
      hyperemic response weakens the adjacent bone and increases the risk of spontaneous fracture.&#xD;
      Furthermore, patients who have recurrent pain at a site previously irradiated may not be&#xD;
      eligible for further radiation therapy secondary to limitations in normal tissue tolerance.&#xD;
      Hesitation on the part of physicians to use a larger dose may be related to increased&#xD;
      long-term toxicity. Larger radiation dose produces a greater risk of complications such as&#xD;
      fibrosis of normal soft tissue, which can cause a decrement in the quality of life in cases&#xD;
      of life expectancy longer than 6 months. There may also be a greater incidence of acute side&#xD;
      effects of nausea and vomiting if the treatment field includes the stomach. The percent of&#xD;
      patients experiencing vomiting following EBRT ranges from about 5% to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A palliative treatment for painful bone metastases that is non-invasive, without long-term&#xD;
      toxicity and having minimal complications would be a useful tool for treating physicians and&#xD;
      also a beneficial option for patients suffering from painful bone metastases. Results of&#xD;
      preliminary studies indicate that ExAblate treatment of painful bone metastases may be a&#xD;
      beneficial treatment option [14, 15]. The ExAblate system is a non-invasive thermal ablation&#xD;
      device used in the coagulation of various types of soft tissue. The ExAblate system has the&#xD;
      potential to achieve the first three of the four previously mentioned goals in the treatment&#xD;
      of bone tumors; namely pain relief, preservation and restoration of functional levels and&#xD;
      local tumor control [11]. The ExAblate system used in the present study is a technological&#xD;
      advance over the ExAblate 2000 fixed transducer system in terms of flexibility of use and&#xD;
      reduction of positioning related pain to the patients. The ExAblate system used in this study&#xD;
      conforms to the patient's body shape at the location of the bone mets location&#xD;
