      The objective of this study is to determine if observations the investigators made in an&#xD;
      animal model of sepsis can be translated to clinical practice. Specifically, the&#xD;
      investigators will use the noninvasive Orthogonal Polarization Spectral (OPS) microscope and&#xD;
      venous oxygen saturation to test the hypothesis that recombinant human erythropoietin(rHuEPO)&#xD;
      will acutely improve the microcircualtion in septic patients in the ICU.&#xD;

      Sepsis is a systemic inflammatory response to a bacterial infection and is a common&#xD;
      complication during the course of treatment of patients with multiple trauma and major&#xD;
      surgery. In severe sepsis, the inflammatory response leads to multiple organ failure that can&#xD;
      result in death. Multiple organ dysfunction in sepsis is now considered the most common cause&#xD;
      of death in non-coronary critical care units. In fact, sepsis is one of the top 10 or 12&#xD;
      causes of death in the general population. Approximately 150,000 people die annually.1 On a&#xD;
      microscopic level there is impairment in the relationship between oxygen delivery (DO2) and&#xD;
      consumption (VO2) suggestive of defects in microcirculatory perfusion during septic&#xD;
      shock.2,3,4 These alterations include a decrease in the proportion of perfused vessels&#xD;
      smaller than 20 μm, which mostly are capillaries whereas flow in the larger perfusion vessels&#xD;
      is preserved. As the micro-circulation alteration persists then multiple organ failure and&#xD;
      death ensues,4 thus interventions able to improve the microcirculation may reduce tissue&#xD;
      dysoxia. De Backer et. al.3 reported that topical application of acetylcholine can restore a&#xD;
      normal microcirculatory flow pattern in patients with septic shock, indicating an important&#xD;
      role for the micro-vascular endothelium, and that these alterations can be manipulated. Other&#xD;
      experimental studies of several vasodilatory compounds have been shown to improve&#xD;
      micro-vascular perfusion5,6,7,8,9 and even be associated with improved outcomes.7,10 In a&#xD;
      human study, Spronk et. al.11 observed that intravenous administration of nitroglycerin&#xD;
      resulted in a marked improvement in capillary perfusion, but this intervention may produce&#xD;
      severe arterial hypotension and also increase some nitric oxide mediated cytoxic&#xD;
      effects.12,13 In another human study, De Baker et. al.14 demonstrated that the administration&#xD;
      of 5 μg/kg-min dobutamine can improve but not restore capillary perfusion in patients with&#xD;
      septic shock and that these changes are independent of changes in systemic hemodynamic&#xD;
      variables. The concomitant decrease in blood lactate level suggested the changes in the&#xD;
      micro-vascular perfusion were associated with improved cellular metabolism. However,&#xD;
      dobutamine may also produce hypotension in patients with hypovolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythropoietin (EPO), a sialoglycoprotein hormone produced by the adult kidney, is a major&#xD;
      regulator of red blood cell production but more recently has been suggested to have&#xD;
      favourable effects on tissue injury and vascular function. It stimulates the proliferation of&#xD;
      committed erythroid progenitor cells and their development into mature erythrocytes.15 Thus,&#xD;
      the potential benefit of erythropoietin therapy in patients with anemia secondary to chronic&#xD;
      renal failure has long been recognized.16 Recombinant Human EPO (rh-EPO) is indicated for the&#xD;
      treatment of anemia associated with chronic renal failure, non-myeloid malignancies due to&#xD;
      the effect of concomitantly administered chemotherapy, zidovudine treated HIV infected&#xD;
      patients and patients under going major elective surgery to facilitate autologous blood&#xD;
      collection thus to reduce allogenic blood exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In critically ill adults and specifically those with sepsis, EPO levels have been shown to be&#xD;
      relatively low with respect to the level of anemia present.17,18 As well, correlations were&#xD;
      found between erythropoietin concentration and biological markers of tissue hypoperfusion&#xD;
      i.e. lactate level or PCO2 gap.19 A common adverse effect of rh-EPO therapy in renal patients&#xD;
      is the development of hypertension. The acute effects of rh-EPO on arterial vasoactivity&#xD;
      suggest direct and indirect actions that occur prior to any effect on erythropoeisis. In&#xD;
      addition to its hematopoietic effect, rh-EPO also has significant cardiovascular&#xD;
      effects,20,21 including a direct vasopressor effect.22 In a rat splanchnic artery occlusion&#xD;
      shock model, treatment with rh-EPO inhibited inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) activity&#xD;
      and prevented the overproduction of NO in vivo restoring responsiveness to&#xD;
      Phenylephrine.23,24 Rh-EPO has direct vasopressor effects on smooth muscle cells, which&#xD;
      express EPO receptors, modulating intracellular Ca++.25 An increase in the plasma levels of&#xD;
      the endothelium derived vasoconstrictor endothelin-1 can occur after rh-EPO&#xD;
      treatment.26,27,28 Indirect effects of EPO treatment may also increase the activity of the&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system and increase sensitivity to angiotensin II, which is a potent&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor.29 We recently reported that rh-EPO in a septic mouse model produces an&#xD;
      immediate increase in the perfused capillary density with a concomitant decrease in NADH&#xD;
      fluorescence, an indirect measure indicating improvement in mitochondical oxidative&#xD;
      phosphorylation, in skeletal muscle. Thus, rh-EPO appears to improve tissue bioenergetics in&#xD;
      this septic mouse model in part by maintaining DO2 via increased perfused capillary&#xD;
      density.30 The recently developed, noninvasive orthogonal polarization spectral (OPS) imaging&#xD;
      technique can be applied to investigate the human vasculature.34 Polarized light of defined&#xD;
      wavelength (548 nm) is emitted to illuminate the area of interest, is reflected by the&#xD;
      background but absorbed by hemoglobin, producing high-contrast images of the&#xD;
      micro-circulation. This technique is particularly convenient for studying tissues protected&#xD;
      by a thin epithelial layer, such as the mucosal surface35 and has been validated as an&#xD;
      effective method of micro-vascular imaging in animals34, 36,37 and in humans.38 The OPS&#xD;
      technique has been used to observe major micro-vascular blood flow alterations in patients&#xD;
      with severe sepsis3 including a decreased vascular density, especially of the small vessels;&#xD;
      a large number of non-perfused and intermittently perfused small vessels; and a marked&#xD;
      perfusion heterogeneity between areas.39 These alterations were more severe in non-survivors&#xD;
      than in survivors but were not affected by the global hemodynamic state or vasopressor&#xD;
      agents.39 The persistence of micro-vascular alterations in patients with poor outcomes&#xD;
      further emphasize the potential role of micro-circulatory disturbances in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of sepsis-induced multiple organ failure. In this study, we will use the OPS imaging&#xD;
      technique to investigate the sublingual microcirculation in patients with septic shock after&#xD;
      treatment with a single dose of rh-EPO. We hypothesize that rh-EPO will improve the&#xD;
      sepsis-related alterations in micro-circulatory perfusion, independent of any systemic&#xD;
      hemodynamic effects.&#xD;
