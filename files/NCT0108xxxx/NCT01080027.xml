      The rationale of this study is to assess the safety profile, efficacy and adherence to Rebif®&#xD;
      New Formulation in real life settings with a multinational approach, as well as the impact of&#xD;
      this improved formulation (with regards to adverse events [AEs]) to subjects' adherence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This international, multicentric, prospective, observational study is being conducted to&#xD;
      assess the safety profile, efficacy and adherence to Rebif® New Formulation in real life&#xD;
      settings in subjects with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis (RRMS), as well as the&#xD;
      impact of this improved formulation (with regards to adverse events [AEs]) to subjects'&#xD;
      adherence. Three hundred and fifty subjects from approximately 80 sites across seven&#xD;
      countries will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be treated with IFN beta-1a (Rebif®&#xD;
      New Formulation) in real life settings according to the clinical and paraclinical course and&#xD;
      laboratory findings as routinely evaluated by the physician. Data related to AEs; subjects'&#xD;
      adherence to treatment, reasons for treatment discontinuation; number and reasons of missed&#xD;
      injections; and the clinical and paraclinical data on efficacy regarding relapses will be&#xD;
      captured. Data will be reported prospectively throughout the duration of the study (12&#xD;
      months) at two visits (at month 6 and month 12) following the initial visit; at baseline,&#xD;
      data can be recorded retrospectively from the subjects' medical file. All the data will be&#xD;
      evaluated descriptively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the local tolerability of Rebif® New Formulation in real life settings with a&#xD;
           multinational approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the safety profile, subjects' adherence to and efficacy of Rebif® New&#xD;
           Formulation&#xD;
