    <textblock>
      The Community Youth Development Study is an experimental test of the Communities That Care&#xD;
      (CTC) prevention planning system. It has been designed to find out if communities that were&#xD;
      trained to use the CTC system improved public health by reducing rates of adolescent drug&#xD;
      use, delinquency, violence, and risky sexual behavior when compared to communities that did&#xD;
      not use this approach. The primary purpose of the current continuation study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether CTC has long-term effects on substance use, antisocial behavior, and&#xD;
      violence, as well as secondary effects on educational attainment, mental health, and sexual&#xD;
      risk behavior in young adults at ages 26 and 28. The continuation study also examines (a) how&#xD;
      the interaction of social, normative, and legal marijuana contexts creates variation in the&#xD;
      permissiveness of individuals' marijuana environments from late childhood to young adulthood&#xD;
      and (b) whether, when, and for whom permissive marijuana environments increase marijuana and&#xD;
      ATOD use and misuse from age 11 to 28 and interfere with the adoption of adult roles.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Preventing alcohol, tobacco, and other drug use; delinquency; violence; and health-risking&#xD;
      sexual behavior among adolescents is a national priority. While advances in prevention&#xD;
      science over the past two decades have produced a growing list of tested and effective&#xD;
      programs and policies for preventing these behaviors, widespread dissemination and&#xD;
      high-quality implementation of these effective programs and policies in communities has not&#xD;
      been achieved. The development and testing of approaches for translating prevention research&#xD;
      findings into effective community prevention service systems with long-term impact is&#xD;
      important to achieving reductions in the prevalence of adolescent health and behavior&#xD;
      problems that are sustained into adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Community Youth Development Study (CYDS) is a community-randomized trial of the effects&#xD;
      of Communities That Care (CTC) on community prevention systems and adolescent risk,&#xD;
      protection, and behavioral health outcomes. The current continuation study is evaluating the&#xD;
      long-term effects of CTC on a panel of 4,407 young adults at ages 21 and 23 who have been&#xD;
      surveyed regularly since the trial started when they were in grade 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CTC is a prevention planning and capacity building system for improving behavioral health&#xD;
      problems among youth community-wide. CTC guides communities to implement with fidelity and&#xD;
      monitor the results of effective prevention programs that address community-specific elevated&#xD;
      risk factors and depressed protective factors and reduce problem behavior. The CTC system is&#xD;
      hypothesized first to produce improvements in key characteristics of community prevention&#xD;
      service systems, which, in turn, reduce community levels of risk, increase protective&#xD;
      factors, and lower rates of youth problem behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CYDS communities were matched in pairs within state, on population size, racial and&#xD;
      ethnic diversity, economic indicators, and crime rates. One community from each matched pair&#xD;
      was assigned randomly by a coin toss to either the intervention or control condition.&#xD;
      Starting in 2003, intervention communities received training, technical assistance, and&#xD;
      materials and funding needed to install the CTC prevention system in years 2-5 (2004-2008),&#xD;
      hire a community coordinator, and implement 2-5 tested preventive interventions. Selected&#xD;
      interventions addressed local prevention priorities established by communities after&#xD;
      reviewing local epidemiological data on youth risk factors, protective factors and problem&#xD;
      behaviors. Control communities received no training or technical assistance from the study.&#xD;
      Technical assistance and study-provided funding to intervention communities ended after 5&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial CYDS trial (2003-2008) evaluated the efficacy of CTC in reducing levels of risk,&#xD;
      increasing levels of protection, and reducing levels of drug use and other problem behaviors&#xD;
      in adolescents from Grades 5 through 9. It also tested the effects of CTC on prevention&#xD;
      service system transformation (e.g., increases in a science-based approach to prevention,&#xD;
      collaboration among prevention service organizations, support for prevention, community norms&#xD;
      against drug use and delinquency, and use of the Social Development Strategy to guide&#xD;
      interactions with youth) as reported by key community leaders and members of CTC coalitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first continuation study (2009-2013) assessed the effects of installation and&#xD;
      implementation of CTC when panel youth were in Grades 10 through Age 19. During this period,&#xD;
      panel youth passed through high school, the developmental period of greatest risk for&#xD;
      delinquent and violent behavior, and a period of greatly increasing substance use and&#xD;
      problems related to substance use. The study evaluated the long-term effects of CTC on&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult risk and problem behaviors, including primary outcomes of&#xD;
      substance use and abuse, delinquency, crime, and violence. It also evaluated the&#xD;
      sustainability of the CTC prevention system without the study-provided funding and support&#xD;
      that were offered during the implementation of CTC in the 12 intervention communities during&#xD;
      the initial efficacy trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second continuation study (2013-2017) investigated the long-term effects of CTC on young&#xD;
      adult substance use and misuse, crime, violence, and incarceration 11 and 13 years following&#xD;
      CTC's initial installation. It also evaluated possible effects on a number of secondary&#xD;
      outcomes salient in young adulthood, including HIV/AIDS sexual risk behavior, depression and&#xD;
      suicidality, anxiety and other mental health disorders, and educational attainment. Panel&#xD;
      youth were surveyed twice during the study, at ages 21 and 23.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The third continuation study (2018-2023) further investigates the long-term effects of CTC on&#xD;
      the study's primary outcomes of substance use and misuse, crime, violence, and incarceration&#xD;
      16 and 18 years after CTC was installed in intervention communities. As in the prior&#xD;
      continuation, it will also evaluate possible long-term effects on salient secondary outcomes,&#xD;
      including HIV/AIDS sexual risk behavior, depression and suicidality, anxiety and other mental&#xD;
      health disorders, and educational attainment. Another major aim of this study is to examine&#xD;
      the normative and legal environment around marijuana use in the U.S., which is becoming more&#xD;
      permissive, raising concern that it will increase youth and young adult marijuana and other&#xD;
      drug use and associated negative consequences including addiction. Understanding how&#xD;
      marijuana use norms and behaviors in multiple social contexts (e.g., peer, family, and&#xD;
      community) interact with the legal marijuana context and impact drug use behavior from age 11&#xD;
      to 28 will assist in the identification of malleable targets for interventions and public&#xD;
      health approaches to prevent the possible negative outcomes of increasing permissiveness&#xD;
      towards marijuana use. Panel participants will be surveyed twice, at ages 26 and 28.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>We support the goal of making datasets available to researchers in a timely manner to expedite translation of research results into knowledge, products, and procedures to improve human health. With these goals in mind, we have entered into data-sharing collaborations many times with outside researchers. To ensure that the use of these data stay within the legal and ethical constraints of the consent agreement under which they were collected, we have developed a Fair Use Agreement, available upon request, that is signed by the Principal Investigator, Dr. Kuklinski, and by the collaborating researcher when agreement has been reached to share study data. As part of the Fair Use Agreement, we ask researchers to abide by the same Data and Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) that we adhere to. We will continue to share data with other researchers who meet the terms of our Fair Use Agreement (and DSMP) and share our strong commitment to protection of the rights and privacy of study participants.</ipd_description>
