      The study is a two-arm, parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled, double blind trial,&#xD;
      conducted at four primary health care centers in Aleppo, Syria, to test the efficacy of&#xD;
      behavioral counseling with and without transdermal nicotine therapy on long-term smoking&#xD;
      cessation rates. The trial will be conducted at four primary care clinics in Aleppo, Syria&#xD;
      that are sponsored by private or non governmental organizations. Clinic physicians will be&#xD;
      trained to provide a brief assessment of each patient's smoking status and motivation to&#xD;
      quit, and to refer appropriate patients to a cessation clinic within the primary care center.&#xD;
      Eligible and interested smokers will be randomized to receive behavioral cessation counseling&#xD;
      + nicotine patch or behavioral cessation counseling + placebo patch. Behavioral counseling&#xD;
      will be delivered by a physician at each clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After eligibility is determined and a description of the cessation program has been provided,&#xD;
      written informed consent will be obtained. When literacy is a concern, the consent form will&#xD;
      be read to the subjects who will then mark the form to indicate consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will provide baseline demographic data (age, gender, ethnicity, residence,&#xD;
      marital status, education, occupation, income), smoking related information (smoking history,&#xD;
      level of dependence, interest in quitting, comorbidities), and complete additional&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess quitting self-efficacy, stage of change, withdrawal symptoms, and&#xD;
      depression/mood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be allocated to one of two treatment conditions (Arm A: behavioral&#xD;
      counseling + nicotine patch vs. Arm B: behavioral counseling + placebo patch) using random&#xD;
      permuted blocks, stratified according to primary care center and gender. Specific behavioral&#xD;
      and pharmacological intervention procedures are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in Arm A will receive active transdermal nicotine, and participants in Arm B&#xD;
      will receive placebo patch. Transdermal nicotine replacement was selected as the&#xD;
      pharmacologic agent of choice, based on its ease of use, acceptability to patients, favorable&#xD;
      side effect and contraindications profile, and its well researched and documented efficacy&#xD;
      (Fiore et al., 1994). Additionally, our pilot intervention work in Syria indicates a high&#xD;
      degree of acceptability of the patch as a potential smoking cessation intervention (Asfar et&#xD;
      al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with clinical practice guidelines in the U.S. (Fiore et al., 2000),&#xD;
      participants will receive six weeks of patch treatment, 24 hour dose, using a step-down&#xD;
      algorithm. Participants who smoke greater than 10 cigarettes/day will be receive two weeks of&#xD;
      21 mg patch, followed by two weeks of 14 mg patch, and then two weeks of 7 mg patch.&#xD;
      Participants who smoke 5-9 cigarettes per day will receive four weeks of 14 mg patch,&#xD;
      followed by two weeks of 7 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in both arms receive three brief face-to-face counseling sessions and five brief&#xD;
      (approximately 10 minute) phone counseling calls. Session 1 occurs 3-4 days before the&#xD;
      scheduled quit day and focuses on preparing to quit. Calls 1 and 2 occur the day before and&#xD;
      the day after quit day, respectively, and focus on surviving the first few days as a&#xD;
      non-smoker. Session 2 takes place 7 days after the quit day and emphasizes provision of&#xD;
      social support, problem solving, and coping with withdrawal symptoms and negative emotions.&#xD;
      The final session occurs 14 days after quit day and emphasizes relapse prevention and coping&#xD;
      skills training. An additional three phone calls occur 10, 30, and 45 days after quit day and&#xD;
      provide social support, check progress, and reinforce coping skills. Follow-up assessments&#xD;
      occur at 7 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months post-cessation.&#xD;
