  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, prospective, non-interventional, non-randomised, open label&#xD;
      multicentric study planned to be conducted in 1000 subjects with mild to moderate primary&#xD;
      hypertension in approximately 20 centres in Thailand. The purpose of this study is to examine&#xD;
      the beneficial effects of combination of bisoprolol with hydrochlorothiazide available as&#xD;
      Lodoz in treatment of Thai subjects with mild to moderate hypertension. The outcome of the&#xD;
      study would also provide information on the optimal daily dosage schedule as well as&#xD;
      adherence of Lodoz.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Essential hypertension is a heterogenous multifactorial disease affecting large number of&#xD;
      population. Monotherapy treatment in hypertension is often unable to achieve the desired&#xD;
      blood pressure (BP) goals and subjects even remain at significant risk for developing&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The use of combination therapy as first line treatment for&#xD;
      hypertension provides a solution to the management problems related to hypertension. Among&#xD;
      combination drugs, low dose combinations are useful tools in treating large segments of&#xD;
      hypertensive subjects because of their several advantages, such as simplified dosage&#xD;
      regimens, improve compliance and hypertensive control, decrease dose dependent side effects&#xD;
      as well as reduce costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of Lodoz therapy when used in routine clinical practice in&#xD;
           subjects with mild to moderate essential hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the discontinuation rate of Lodoz therapy.&#xD;
