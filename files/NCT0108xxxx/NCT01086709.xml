      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - National Cancer Institute Protocol 04-C-N191, also known as the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial,&#xD;
      was a double-blind controlled study of the effectiveness of an experimental human&#xD;
      papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine in preventing cervical cancer in young women in Costa Rica.&#xD;
      Costa Rica was part of the first large study to show the association between HPV and cervical&#xD;
      cancer, and the study contributed greatly to the understanding of this association. The women&#xD;
      who have participated in the vaccine trial in Costa Rica are reaching the end of the&#xD;
      follow-up period offered in the vaccine trial protocol, and as a result they are being&#xD;
      offered the chance to have complementary vaccinations against HPV, hepatitis A, and hepatitis&#xD;
      B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To offer participants in the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial the vaccine that they did not&#xD;
           receive during the masked portion of the trial (HPV vaccine or hepatitis A vaccine) and&#xD;
           hepatitis B vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect information about exposure to known and suspected risk factors for HPV&#xD;
           infection and cervical cancer from women who are receiving vaccination against HPV at&#xD;
           crossover.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Women who participated in National Cancer Institute Protocol 04-C-N191.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be offered vaccination against hepatitis B.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who received the hepatitis A vaccine during the trial will be offered vaccination&#xD;
           against HPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women who received the HPV vaccine during the trial will be offered vaccination against&#xD;
           hepatitis A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Appropriate vaccinations (including a combined hepatitis A and hepatitis B vaccine) will&#xD;
           be available to reduce the number of injections that participants will be asked to&#xD;
           receive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All vaccines will be given according to the manufacturer's specifications for&#xD;
           appropriate length of time between vaccine doses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the mid 1980 s, the Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics of the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute in collaboration with investigators in Costa Rica has conducted studies regarding&#xD;
      cervical cancer and HPV infection. The first effort was a case control study where Costa Rica&#xD;
      was one of the Latin American countries included, and it was the first large epidemiological&#xD;
      study to show the association between HPV and cervical cancer. The second study, consisting&#xD;
      of a 10,049 women population-based cohort, the Guanacaste cohort, was carried out from 1993&#xD;
      until 2004, and has greatly contributed to the understanding of the natural history of HPV&#xD;
      infection and its relationship with precancerous cervical lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The profound knowledge of the natural history of HPV infection and cervical neoplasia in&#xD;
      Guanacaste, Costa Rica together with the promising results of the different HPV vaccine&#xD;
      trials led the National Cancer Institute, in collaboration with investigators in Costa Rica,&#xD;
      to launch a community-based randomized phase III clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      virus-like particle HPV vaccine (henceforth referred to as the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial&#xD;
      (CVT)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial were to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      candidate vaccine to prevent persisting HPV-16/18 infections and related histopathologically&#xD;
      confirmed CIN2+ lesions among the according to protocol subcohort and the overall population&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. In contrast, the objectives of this protocol are aimed at offering&#xD;
      beneficial complementary vaccination to women enrolled in the trial with an additional&#xD;
      objective to collect biological specimens from women receiving the HPV-16/18 vaccine to&#xD;
      complement the information obtained during the masked phase of the trial. As an additional&#xD;
      objective, we propose to collect information regarding exposure to known and suspected risk&#xD;
      factors for HPV infection and cervical cancer and biological specimens during this crossover&#xD;
      phase that will complement those collected during the masked phase of the Costa Rica Vaccine&#xD;
      Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collection of risk factor information and biological specimens during this crossover phase&#xD;
      will be restricted to women receiving vaccination against HPV 16/18 at crossover. These&#xD;
      samples will permit a more complete and comprehensive evaluation of the vaccine&#xD;
      immunogenicity. Also, those specimens will allow for ancillary analyses and studies (e.g.,&#xD;
      natural history of HPV infection acquisition/clearance) and to assist ongoing efforts to&#xD;
      evaluate the longer-term impact of HPV-16/18 vaccination.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        To be eligible to receive crossover vaccination, participants must fulfill all of the&#xD;
        following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation Status: Women previously randomized into the HPV-16/18 vaccine trial&#xD;
             04-C-N191, also known as the Costa Rica Vaccine Trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Planned Residence: Residents of Guanacaste or Puntarenas Province or willingness to&#xD;
             visit one of the study clinics for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent: Written informed consent obtained prior to enrollment into the crossover&#xD;
             protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following criteria will be checked for all potential participants at the time of&#xD;
        enrollment. If any apply, the participant will not be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of (a) allergic reaction (e.g., difficulty breathing) after receipt of any&#xD;
             vaccine, (b) hypersensitivity to latex.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of vaccine related adverse events during the vaccination phase that, at the&#xD;
             discretion of the investigators, preclude vaccination during the crossover phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are receiving vaccination with Cervarix , are sexually experienced and of childbearing&#xD;
             potential (i.e., not surgically sterilized), and are unwilling to use an effective&#xD;
             method of birth control for 30 days before vaccination until 60 days after the last&#xD;
             Cervarix vaccination (approximately 9 months). Acceptable forms of birth control&#xD;
             include abstinence, surgical sterilization, hormonal contraceptives (e.g., oral,&#xD;
             injectable, implant, and patch), intrauterine devices, and diaphragm or condom.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic condition that per attending doctor opinion precludes her from&#xD;
             receiving vaccination (e.g., no proper treatment available or participant is unwilling&#xD;
             to stay under proper treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a diagnosed autoimmune illness (per the specific requirement of&#xD;
             the INCIENSA IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The vaccine or vaccines the participant is interested in receiving are contraindicated&#xD;
             in her case.&#xD;
