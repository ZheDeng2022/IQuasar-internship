  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II study evaluating the feasibility of concurrent carboplatin given with&#xD;
      focal radiation therapy in children age 12 months to &lt; 21 years with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      localized ependymoma who have no or minimal residual disease post-operatively (&lt; 0.5 cm). The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that utilizing carboplatin as a radiosensitizer is feasible and tolerable and&#xD;
      may improve event-free survival (EFS) and minimize local recurrences as compared to historic&#xD;
      controls. Following a neurosurgical resection and staging, patients who meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria will receive standard fractionated radiation therapy at doses of 54 to 59.4 Gy to&#xD;
      the primary site depending upon age. All patients will receive 35 mg/m²/day of carboplatin&#xD;
      prior to each fraction of radiotherapy. Although significant neutropenia is not anticipated,&#xD;
      G-CSF will be administered per study guidelines during radiation if neutropenia occurs. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed for toxicity, response (resolution of residual disease) and&#xD;
      event-free survival (EFS). Patients' tumor sample, blood and cerebro-spinal fluid (CSF) will&#xD;
      also be prospectively evaluated to quantify the level of Survivin, a known inhibitor of&#xD;
      apoptosis, via immunohistochemistry, Western Blot Analysis (in tumor tissue) and ELISA (in&#xD;
      blood and CSF). The feasibility of obtaining these levels prospectively and in real time will&#xD;
      be evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>Tolerability and toxicity will be measured by documenting the toxicities associated with this treatment using the current CTCAE version 4.0. The feasibility of this therapy will be measured by observing the ability to finish therapy without delays and the ability to receive daily carboplatin and radiation in the time alloted by the study (within 4 hours) on a daily basis. Delays in therapy will be documented in an effort to define both tolerability and feasibility.</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be enrolled before treatment begins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be ≥ 12 months and &lt; 22 years of age at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The target tumors are primary brain non-metastatic (M0) ependymomas tumors. Patients&#xD;
             must have histologic verification of an ependymoma at diagnosis. Patients with the&#xD;
             following world health organization (WHO) diagnoses will be eligible for this&#xD;
             study:Ependymoma (Subtypes: cellular, papillary, clear cell and tanycytic) and&#xD;
             Anaplastic Ependymoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of ≥ 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Newly diagnosed ependymoma and must not have had any prior chemotherapy or&#xD;
             radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients must have:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A pre-operative MRI scan of the brain with and without contrast. NOTE: CT scans&#xD;
                  are NOT sufficient for study eligibility since radiation therapy planning and&#xD;
                  responses will be based on MRI scans only.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-operative head MRI scan with and without contrast (preferably within 72&#xD;
                  hours post-operatively).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Spinal MRI (T-1 weighted imaging with and without gadolinium) is required within&#xD;
                  28 days of surgery if done post-operatively and within 14 days of surgery if done&#xD;
                  pre-operatively. For posterior fossa tumors, pre-operative MRI scans are&#xD;
                  preferred because surgically induced inflammation/blood can be difficult to&#xD;
                  distinguish from tumor.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Hemoglobin ≥ 10.0 gm/dl (may receive RBC transfusions)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Adequate renal function defined as:&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  SGOT (AST) or SGPT (ALT) &lt;2.5 x institutional normals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must begin chemoradiotherapy within 56 days of definitive surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All patients and/or their parents or legal guardians must sign a written informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must provide assent as per local IRB guidelines (if applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients and/or their families must consent to the mandatory biology studies,&#xD;
             including serum Survivin levels, CSF Survivin levels, paraffin-embedded tissue and&#xD;
             fresh-frozen tissue when available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Karnofsky/Lansky scoring greater than 50.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Corticosteroid supportive care is permissible at the clinician's discretion prior to&#xD;
             and during chemo-radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-seizure medication support is permitted as necessary and at the treating&#xD;
             physician's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy or prior radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or breast feeding, or patients (male or female) not&#xD;
             employing adequate contraception. Acceptable means of birth control include IUD, oral&#xD;
             contraceptive, subdermal implant, a condom with a contraceptive sponge or suppository&#xD;
             or abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to undergo MR imaging&#xD;
