    <textblock>
      To date the standard non-surgical treatment strategy for treating un-ruptured intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms is the use of either coils or self-expandable stents. This post-market clinical&#xD;
      investigation compares the efficacy of using the CE-marked, commercially available SILK&#xD;
      Artery Reconstruction Device against commercially available intracranial coils in the&#xD;
      endovascular treatment (occlusion) of intracranial aneurysms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To date the standard non-surgical treatment strategy for treating un-ruptured intracranial&#xD;
      aneurysms is the use of either coils or self-expandable stents. The flow diverter stent&#xD;
      concept is based upon the hemodynamic exclusion of the aneurysm sac, without coils being&#xD;
      eventually placed within the sac. The primary objective of this post-market clinical&#xD;
      investigation is to demonstrate that when using the CE-marked, commercially available SILK&#xD;
      Artery Reconstruction Device in the indication for which it is approved, notably for the&#xD;
      treatment (occlusion) of intracranial aneurysms, the anatomical results are superior compared&#xD;
      to standard treatment with commercially available intracranial coils (used with eventual&#xD;
      balloon remodeling and/or stents when necessary). It is a prospective, randomized, unblinded,&#xD;
      multi-center post-market clinical investigation. The patient population comprises a maximum&#xD;
      of 160 subjects with at least one documented untreated, unruptured intracranial aneurysm&#xD;
      suitable for occlusion with an intracranial device. Subject enrollment will require a maximum&#xD;
      of 18 months. Enrolled subjects will be followed for 12 months after treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective is to demonstrate that when using the SILK Artery Reconstruction Device in the indication for which it is approved, notably for the treatment (occlusion) of intracranial aneurysms, the anatomical results are superior compared to standard treatment with commercially available intracranial coils. Therefore, angiographic assessment will measure efficacy by determining the percentage of subjects in each of the two arms experiencing complete occlusion of the aneurysm at 12 months post-procedure.</description>

    <description>Safety will be evaluated as follows:&#xD;
Peri-procedural ischemic and hemorrhagic adverse events&#xD;
Peri-procedural technical complications&#xD;
Death from any cause&#xD;
Neurological deterioration&#xD;
Cranial nerve deficit&#xD;
General adverse events&#xD;
In addition, Subject Quality of Life (QOL) will be measured at baseline and at 12 months post-procedure using the EuroQol questionnaire.</description>
