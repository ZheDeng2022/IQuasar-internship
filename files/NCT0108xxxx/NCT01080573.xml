      This 1-arm, open-label, multicentric, observational study aims to collect subject centric&#xD;
      information in line with routine care. Subjects' expectations of therapy, side effect&#xD;
      management and lifestyle may influence adherence to therapy. This survey aims to determine&#xD;
      whether such factors and/or others affect the successful initiation and maintenance of Rebif&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected during this study will include information on the subject's treatment&#xD;
      including expectations, experience, training and support. The results of the study will be&#xD;
      used to understand the impact on subjects' compliance and tailor training and support&#xD;
      services to subject's need. It will also be made available to other healthcare organisations&#xD;
      involved in the subjects treatment.&#xD;

      Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic, inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central&#xD;
      nervous system and is one of the most common causes of neurological disability in young&#xD;
      adults. It is characterised by multifocal, recurrent attacks of neurological symptoms and&#xD;
      signs with variable recovery. Eventually the majority of subjects develop a progressive&#xD;
      clinical course. It is important to carefully initiate and maintain subjects with MS on&#xD;
      therapy. Information will be gathered in a structured way which will enable easier&#xD;
      identification of any subgroups of subjects who may be at risk of poor compliance. These risk&#xD;
      groups could possibly include groups with particular attributes such as poor information at&#xD;
      the start of treatment, unrealistic expectations or a particular life style. This study will&#xD;
      be conducted during the contact with the subject necessary to deliver the homecare service.&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by Bupa Home Healthcare Multiple Sclerosis subject&#xD;
      coordinators by telephone to conduct specific questionnaires during the 4 stages of the&#xD;
      subject's treatment i.e. pre-installation of treatment, post installation of treatment,&#xD;
      monthly pre delivery of drug and at a subject's end treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To collect subject centric information in line with routine care including subject's&#xD;
           expectations of therapy, side effect management and lifestyle may influence adherence to&#xD;
           therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether such factors and/or others affect the successful initiation and&#xD;
           maintenance of Rebif therapy&#xD;
