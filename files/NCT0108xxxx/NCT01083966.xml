  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A recent study by Plotkin et al. showed that bevacizumab (Avastin) treatment was followed by&#xD;
      clinically meaningful hearing improvement, tumor-volume reduction, or both in some, but not&#xD;
      all, patients with Vestibular Schwannoma (VS) who were at risk for complete hearing loss or&#xD;
      brain-stem compression from growing VS. Because of the promising results in preliminary&#xD;
      studies of Bevacizumab and because of significant experience with the safety of the dosages&#xD;
      proposed in this study, this study will offer a safe treatment for patients with VS.&#xD;
      Therefore, this phase I clinical research trial will test the hypothesis that Bevacizumab can&#xD;
      be safely used by direct intracranial superselective intraarterial infusion up to a dose of&#xD;
      10mg/kg to ultimately enhance survival and hearing function of patients with VS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Newer techniques in interventional neuroradiology have allowed for a more selective delivery&#xD;
      of catheters higher up into the arterial tree where agents such as chemotherapies, can be&#xD;
      delivered without the risk of adverse affects such as blindness. In fact, studies here at&#xD;
      Cornell have developed very new and exciting super selective intraarterial delivery treatment&#xD;
      for Retinoblastoma and Malignant Glioma brain tumors with little toxicity. Therefore, this&#xD;
      trial will ask one simple question: Is it safe to deliver a first dose of Avastin&#xD;
      intraarterially using these super selective delivery techniques instead of the standard&#xD;
      intravenous route of administration? This should not only increase the amount of drug that&#xD;
      gets to the VS but also spare them of any adverse effects from a less selective delivery.&#xD;
      During that single dose of intraarterial Avastin, they will also receive a dose of mannitol&#xD;
      that opens up the blood brain barrier to improve delivery of the agent to the tumor. After&#xD;
      that single dose of Mannitol and Avastin intraarterially, the patient will be evaluated for 4&#xD;
      weeks to assess for toxicity. If no toxicity, then the will go on and get MRI of the brain&#xD;
      every two months to assess for response up to 12 months. After this, the subject is done with&#xD;
      the &quot;experimental&quot; aspects of the protocol. This is a Phase I trial that is designed to test&#xD;
      the safety of the single dose intraarterial delivery of Avastin and Mannitol,.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To summarize:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Standard of Care: Surgery or radiosurgery: IV Avastin&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental portion of this proposal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 0: Intraarterial Avastin single dose (starting at 2mg/kg and up to 10mg/kg) after&#xD;
      Mannitol to open the blood brain barrier Day 28 (and every two months thereafter): MRI brain&#xD;
      with contrast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the experimental aspects of this treatment plan will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects will first be treated with Mannitol prior to chemotherapy infusion (Mannitol&#xD;
           25%; 3-10 mL/s for 30seconds) in order to disrupt the blood brain barrier. This&#xD;
           technique has been used in several thousand patients in previous studies for the IA&#xD;
           delivery of chemotherapy for malignant glioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To add a single intraarterial delivery (SIACI) of the Avastin with VS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The dose escalation algorithm is as follows: We will use a single intracranial&#xD;
           superselective intraarterial infusion of Avastin, starting at a dose of 2mg/kg in the&#xD;
           first three patients. Assuming no dose limiting toxicity during the first 28 days after&#xD;
           IA infusion, an MRI of the brain will be performed. The doses will be escalated to 4,6,8&#xD;
           and finally 10mg/kg in this Phase I trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Include: Males or females, &gt;=18 years of age, with documented Radiologic&#xD;
      or histologic diagnosis of VS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both hematologic and non-hematologic toxicity will be determined and scored according to the&#xD;
      NCI Common Toxicity Criteria (version 3.0). Monitoring will be conducted by post procedure&#xD;
      history, neurological and physical examinations together with serial blood counts,&#xD;
      prothrombin time (PT), partial thromboplastin time (PTT) and chemistries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Response will be evaluated after 4 weeks via a MRI with the injection of contrast. The&#xD;
      following will be evaluated every cycle, and then during follow-up: neurological examination,&#xD;
      physical examination, performance status, laboratory parameters and review of adverse&#xD;
      reactions. Contrast enhanced MRI (MRI with gadolinium is the preferable imaging study. The&#xD;
      following subjects will be taken off protocol: those with progressive disease; those who&#xD;
      experience dose-limiting toxicity (DLT). Follow-up will continue until disease progression or&#xD;
      death. Survival will be measured from the time of the first dose of IA Avastin® (given at the&#xD;
      start of each treatment cycle).&#xD;
