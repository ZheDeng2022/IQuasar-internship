      Hypothesis: The small molecule and metabolic modulator Dichloroacetate (DCA) is safe,&#xD;
      tolerated as a potential therapy in patients with moderate or severe Pulmonary Arterial&#xD;
      Hypertension (PAH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, two centre study in subjects with PAH WHO functional class III-IV whose&#xD;
      symptoms have been clinically stable on their prescribed medical treatment (which includes&#xD;
      endothelin and/or phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors) for 8 weeks prior to enrollment. Such&#xD;
      patients will be given either DCA 3.0 mg/kg BID (group I), 6.25 mg/kg BID (group II) or 12.5&#xD;
      mg/kg BID (group III) as an additional treatment for 16 weeks. The design is open-label with&#xD;
      the subjects acting as their own controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint is the safety and tolerability of DCA. Secondary end points include: a)&#xD;
      functional capacity including a change in the 6 minute walk form baseline, b) change in&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance (measured by right heart catheterization), c) right ventricular&#xD;
      volumes and mass (measured by MRI), d) NT-proBNP levels changed from baseline, e) change in&#xD;
      FDG-glucose uptake in the lung and right ventricle (measured by PET) and f) change in quality&#xD;
      of life indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      15 evaluable patients in each site are expected to be included.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vascular remodeling in PAH is a state of apoptosis-resistance. As in cancer, a switch&#xD;
      from the anti-apoptotic glycolytic metabolism towards the pro-apoptotic oxidative&#xD;
      phosphorylation metabolism, has been shown to cause regression of vascular remodeling and PAH&#xD;
      in several animal models. This has been achieved with the small molecular DCA, an inhibitor&#xD;
      of the mitochondrial enzyme pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DCA has been used in humans for over 30 years, mostly in the treatment of inherited&#xD;
      mitochondrial disorders and is also currently being evaluated as a potential therapy in&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a first-in-humans, Phase I, two centre study (University of Alberta and Imperial&#xD;
      College) in subjects with advanced PAH, whose symptoms have been clinically stable on their&#xD;
      prescribed medical treatment for 8 weeks prior to enrollment. These treatments include&#xD;
      standard (eg diuretics, warfarin) or specific PAH therapies (eg endothelin or&#xD;
      phosphodiesterase type 5 inhibitors). From the known metabolism of the drugs involved, no&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic interaction is anticipated. In line with most safety and efficacy studies,&#xD;
      the design is open-label with the subjects acting as their own controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PAH who have been stable on their current therapy for the preceding 2 months&#xD;
      will be given either DCA 3.0 mg/kg BID (group I), 6.25 mg/kg BID (group II) or 12.5 mg/kg BID&#xD;
      (group III) as an additional treatment for 16 weeks. Following the baseline visit, the&#xD;
      patients will be followed every week for the first month, and then at weeks 6, 8 10, 12 and&#xD;
      16. In weeks 1, 3, 6 and 10, the patients' status will be assessed by telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all the other visits: medical history and physical examination will be performed. With the&#xD;
      exception of week 2 (unless clinically indicated), this will be combined with routine&#xD;
      hematology and biochemistry and an assessment of functional capacity (6 minute walk test).&#xD;
      Serum lactate and NT-pro-BNP levels will be measured and PDH activity assay will be&#xD;
      performed. Urine will be obtained for DCA metabolite studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline and 16 weeks: A cardiac catheterization to assess change in pulmonary&#xD;
      hemodynamics; a routine cardiac MR (RV mass/volumes, MR angiography); FDG-PET to examine for&#xD;
      an effect on regional lung or RV glucose uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If tolerated well, the subjects will continue with their medication and return for follow-up&#xD;
      assessments at Weeks 20, 24 and 28. At each follow-up visit, a physical examination will be&#xD;
      performed and functional capacity will be assessed (6 minute walk test). At the Week 28 visit&#xD;
      a routine cardiac MR will also be performed. Enrollment will continue until 30 evaluable&#xD;
      subjects (15 in each site) are included.&#xD;
