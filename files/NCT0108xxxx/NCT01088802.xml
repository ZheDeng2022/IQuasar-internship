  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to try to reduce radiation side effects that happen with the&#xD;
      standard radiation methods. Generally surgery, radiation therapy, and sometimes chemotherapy&#xD;
      are standard treatment for people with squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will look at giving a slightly smaller dose of radiation (de-intensification) to&#xD;
      see if regularly expected late toxicities (two years after receiving treatment) can be&#xD;
      reduced. This study will also try to see if the smaller dose of radiation is equally&#xD;
      effective at treating the cancer and to see if it improves quality of life. Along with this&#xD;
      radiation treatment plan some participants in this study will have surgery on their tumor and&#xD;
      or receive chemotherapy (cisplatin or carboplatin). The possible surgery and or chemotherapy&#xD;
      will be up to the participant's doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be tested for the Human Papillomavirus (HPV). This tissue test is&#xD;
      required for this study. Some studies have suggested that HPV-related cancer is biologically&#xD;
      and clinically different as compared to non-HPV-related cancer. Some studies have found that&#xD;
      patients with HPV-related oropharynx cancer have a better response to treatment. This test&#xD;
      will help researchers learn more about HPV-related cancer.&#xD;
