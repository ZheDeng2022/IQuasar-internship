    <textblock>
      Artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) are now the treatment of choice for malaria in&#xD;
      non-pregnant individuals living in areas with established chloroquine resistance; they have&#xD;
      been shown to be both safe and highly efficacious. There is rapidly increasing experience&#xD;
      with artemisinin derivatives in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters of pregnancy, with over 1,000 well&#xD;
      documented cases with no reported serious adverse effects to mother or fetus (WHO Malaria&#xD;
      Treatment Guidelines, 2006). Many countries in Latin America have abandoned the previous 1st&#xD;
      line regimen of Quinine-Clindamycin for treatment of malaria in pregnancy, a complex and&#xD;
      poorly tolerated regimen with low adherence, in favor of ACTs, despite limited safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data on the use of these compounds in pregnant women. Lack of pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      data may lead to underdosing of pregnant women, with subsequent reduced efficacy and&#xD;
      increased potential for development of resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One ACT regimen, Artesunate-Mefloquine, has been developed as a fixed-dose combination&#xD;
      (Farmanguinhos Artesunato + Mefloquina), as part of an international collaborative research&#xD;
      effort led by Drugs for Neglected Diseases Initiative (DNDi), and manufactured by&#xD;
      Farmanguinhos, laboratory of the Brazilian Ministry of Health. Initial clinical trials&#xD;
      suggest that it is very well tolerated and efficacious in both pregnant and non-pregnant&#xD;
      individuals. The convenient dosing afforded by a fixed drug combination make this a very&#xD;
      promising candidate for treatment of pregnant women with malaria. Preliminary pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      data from mefloquine monotherapy and prophylaxis suggest that the peak concentration of&#xD;
      mefloquine is lowered in pregnant women. Prior to wide-spread adoption of the&#xD;
      Artesunate-Mefloquine combination, further studies on safety, efficacy, and dose optimization&#xD;
      are imperative. We propose to compare the pharmacokinetics of the fixed combination of&#xD;
      mefloquine-artesunate (MA) for treatment of P.falciparum in 28 pregnant women in the second&#xD;
      and third trimesters to the pharmacokinetics of this regimen in 28 matched non-pregnant&#xD;
      P.falciparum infected women. This will allow us to determine whether the standard adult dose&#xD;
      is sufficient for pregnant women.&#xD;

             weeks determined by LMP and confirmed by fundal height measurement) Controls:&#xD;
             Non-pregnant women ≥18 years old (negative urine pregnancy test)&#xD;
