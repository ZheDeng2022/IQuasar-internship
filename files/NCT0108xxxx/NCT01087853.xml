  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients often require fluid replacement during and after an operation. This is usually given&#xD;
      through veins in the arm using an intravenous cannula and doctors have traditionally used&#xD;
      fluid containing sodium chloride (saline). However accumulating evidence suggests that large&#xD;
      infusions of saline are associated with adverse physiological effects including acidification&#xD;
      of the blood and a rise in potassium and chloride levels. Studies in animals have shown that&#xD;
      high levels of chloride in the blood and excess saline can cause blood vessels in the kidney&#xD;
      to constrict leading possibly to a decrease in kidney function. Improvement in acid-base&#xD;
      balance and kidney function may be observed with balanced solutions containing constituents&#xD;
      that are more closely matched to the body's own fluid composition. However, little is known&#xD;
      about the physiological effects of these solutions as they have only recently been developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a radiological modality which can now assess blood flow&#xD;
      and supply of the kidney noninvasively without the need for the injection of radiological&#xD;
      dyes known as contrast agents. This is now of major importance due to the possible adverse&#xD;
      effects of MRI contrast agents leading to Nephrogenic Systemic Fibrosis (NSF), a progressive&#xD;
      disease which has been observed in some kidney patients after receiving 'gadolinium based'&#xD;
      contrast agents. This has therefore led to increased interest and demand for noncontrast&#xD;
      based imaging methods. In this study we aim to compare the effects of balanced versus&#xD;
      unbalanced fluid infusions in healthy human volunteers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will aim to measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Blood biochemical composition and acidity&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Kidney function and supply as measured by dynamic MRI&#xD;

      Type of Study: Two phase double blind, randomised crossover study. In phase A (crystalloid),&#xD;
      we will compare the effects of Plasmalyte 148 with 0.9% saline and in phase B (colloid) we&#xD;
      will compare the effects of PVR with Voluven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will either be involved in phase A or phase B not both. In each phase&#xD;
      participants will receive a randomly assigned fluid and then the comparator fluid 1 week&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject selection: 24 healthy, male volunteers, (12 for each phase) between the age of 18 and&#xD;
      40, and weighing between 65 and 80 kg will be recruited for of the study. Informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained before entering volunteers into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol: Volunteers will report for the study at 09.00 hours after a fast from&#xD;
      midnight and having abstained from alcohol, nicotine, tea and coffee for at least 24 hours.&#xD;
      After voiding of the bladder, height will recorded to the nearest 0.01 m, weight measured to&#xD;
      the nearest 0.1 kg using Avery 3306ABV scales (Avery Berkel, Royston, UK), and body mass&#xD;
      index calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any urine passed over a 24 hour period from the start of the infusion will be collected for&#xD;
      measurement of creatinine clearance, osmolality and electrolytes. Two venous cannulae will be&#xD;
      inserted, one in each forearm and blood will be sampled for full blood count, haemoglobin,&#xD;
      electrolytes, creatinine, albumin and osmolality. A venous blood gas sample will also be&#xD;
      obtained to calculate base excess. Serum and urinary osmolality will be measured on a Fiske&#xD;
      2400 Osmometer (Vitech Scientific Ltd., Partridge Green, West Sussex, UK) using a freezing&#xD;
      point depression method which has a coefficient of variance (CV) of 1.2%. A Vitros 950&#xD;
      analyser (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Amersham, UK) will be used to measure serum sodium (CV&#xD;
      0.6%), potassium (CV 1.0%), magnesium, chloride (CV 1.1%), bicarbonate, (CV 4.0%), urea (CV&#xD;
      2.0%) and albumin (CV 1.6%). Strong ion difference will be calculated by subtracting the&#xD;
      serum chloride concentration from the sum of the serum concentrations of sodium and&#xD;
      potassium.28 Urinary sodium (CV 1.5%) and potassium (CV 1.5%) will be assayed on a Vitros 250&#xD;
      analyser (Ortho Clinical Diagnostics, Amersham, UK). Haematological parameters will be&#xD;
      measured on a Sysmex SE 9500 Analyser (Sysmex UK Ltd., Milton Keynes, UK) using direct&#xD;
      current hydrodynamic focusing and cumulative pulse height detection. The CV for haemoglobin&#xD;
      and packed cell volume estimation is 11.5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase A, 12 subjects will receive 2 litres of 0.9% saline BP (Baxter Health Care,&#xD;
      Thetford, UK) or Plasmalyte® (Baxter Health Care, Thetford, UK). The assignment of the&#xD;
      initial infused solution will be random followed by the alternate solution at crossover. The&#xD;
      crystalloid solution will be infused in the supine position over 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Phase B, 12 subjects will receive 1 litre of PlasmaVolume® (Baxter Health Care, Thetford,&#xD;
      UK) or Voluven® (Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany). The initial infused solution will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned and the subject will receive the alternate solution at the crossover&#xD;
      timepoint. The starch solution will be infused in the supine position over 30 minutes. A&#xD;
      nurse who will not be involved in the study will mask all labels and administration sets on&#xD;
      the infusion bags with opaque tape and also perform the randomisation. Randomisation will&#xD;
      performed using sequentially numbered paired sealed opaque envelopes. The aforementioned&#xD;
      blood tests will be repeated at 30/60 minute intervals for 4 hours. Subjects will be&#xD;
      encouraged to void urine as the need arises, and on completion of the study. In addition to&#xD;
      laboratory data, time to first void and void volume will be recorded. Postinfusion urine will&#xD;
      be pooled and analysed for osmolality, pH and concentrations of electrolytes and NGAL. The&#xD;
      crossover experiment will be repeated with the alternate infusion not used in the first&#xD;
      study, 7-10 days later. Participation in the crossover phase will be postponed one week if&#xD;
      the baseline laboratory work shows continued effect of hemodilution or phlebotomy with a&#xD;
      hematocrit decrease of 3% or greater from the first infusion baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of volunteers: Pulse oximetry will be performed continuously during the infusion.&#xD;
      Blood pressure will be measured every 15 min for the first two hours and then every 30 min&#xD;
      until the end of the study. Infusions will be stopped if there is any evidence of&#xD;
      hypersensitivity or anaphylactic reactions or for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulse rate rises above 110/minute or falls below 50/minute. The SaO2 falls below 92% The&#xD;
      blood pressure rises above 140 mm Hg systolic or 95 mm Hg diastolic The blood pressure falls&#xD;
      below 90 mm Hg systolic or 55 mm Hg diastolic The volunteer expresses the desire to have the&#xD;
      infusion stopped.&#xD;
