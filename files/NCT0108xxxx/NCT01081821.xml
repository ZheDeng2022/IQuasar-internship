  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (how the drug is absorbed in the body, how it is distributed within the body and it is&#xD;
      removed from the body over time) of single doses of JNJ-39758979 in healthy Japanese&#xD;
      volunteers and multiple doses of JNJ-39758979 in healthy Japanese and Caucasian volunteers.&#xD;

      This study will assess the safety and pharmacokinetics of JNJ-39758979 or placebo (which&#xD;
      looks like the drug being studied but has no active ingredients) in healthy volunteers. This&#xD;
      study is being conducted in two parts. Part 1 is a randomized (study drug will be assigned by&#xD;
      chance), double-blind (neither the physician nor volunteer knows the identity of the assigned&#xD;
      drug) study evaluating the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of single doses of&#xD;
      JNJ-39758979 and placebo in 36 healthy Japanese male volunteers. Part 2 is a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind study evaluating the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of multiple&#xD;
      doses of JNJ-39758979 and placebo in 24 healthy Japanese males and 24 healthy Caucasian&#xD;
      males. For Part 1, the participation period is a maximum of 56 days, including a screening&#xD;
      visit, a 7-day in-clinic period and two follow-up visits. For Part 2, the participation&#xD;
      period is a maximum of 202 days, including a screening visit, a 17-day in-clinic period and&#xD;
      two follow-up visits. For both parts of the study, safety evaluations, which will include ECG&#xD;
      (a cardiac function test), vital signs and monitoring of side-effects will be performed.&#xD;
      Additionally, blood and urine samples will be collected for evaluation. Part 1: volunteers&#xD;
      will receive a single oral (by mouth) dose of JNJ-39758979 (50, 100, 300, or 600mg) or&#xD;
      placebo; Part 2: volunteers will receive an oral dose of JNJ-39758979 (300 mg) or placebo&#xD;
      once a day for 14 days.&#xD;
