      This is an observational, prospective, non-interventional, non-controlled study planned to be&#xD;
      conducted in subjects with Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this observational study is to determine the correlation between the degree of&#xD;
      disability and sexual dysfunction; and between the sexual dysfunction and the quality of life&#xD;
      (QoL) of subjects with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) in Argentina.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Multiple sclerosis, like most of the chronic diseases, can affect the sexuality of those who&#xD;
      suffer from it. This situation has an evident and marked impact on the QoL of the subjects&#xD;
      and his/her partner, and causes conflict in the relationship, with high levels of mutual&#xD;
      dissatisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact that the duration of the disease or the degree of disability have on the level of&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction is not clear. However, the possible organic and state of mind causes of&#xD;
      the sexual dysfunction makes us think that the degree of disability is a crucial factor in&#xD;
      the genesis and duration of the symptoms in the sexual area. The frequency with which the&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction is detected or referred in these subjects is variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sexual dysfunction in subjects with MS is typically characterized by a decreased libido,&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction and ejaculation disorders in men, and decreased lubrication and&#xD;
      anorgasmia in women. The most commonly detected problems are the erectile dysfunction and/or&#xD;
      lack of sexual interest in men and lack of interest, decreased libido and orgasmic disorder&#xD;
      in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study aims to assess a population of subjects with MS that show symptoms&#xD;
      of sexual dysfunction, in order to determine the relationship, if any, between the severity&#xD;
      of the general disability and the incidence of sexual dysfunction. At the same time, this&#xD;
      epidemiologic study aims to measure the impact the sexual dysfunction generates in the&#xD;
      quality of life of subjects with MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data to be obtained could contribute to a better understanding of the relationship&#xD;
      between the studied variables and, eventually, to alert the treating doctors about the&#xD;
      incidence of these morbid associations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is 24 months. The recruiting period will be 12 months. Once&#xD;
      the recruiting time is over, the collection of data will continue during the full 24 months&#xD;
      period that was planned.&#xD;
