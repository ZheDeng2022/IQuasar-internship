      The objective of this pilot study is to explore barriers to medication adherence among HPHC&#xD;
      members with CKD, particularly those not yet on dialysis, and to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of a wireless, internet-based MedMinder system intervention among HPHC&#xD;
      enrollees with CKD and their care partners. The investigators hypothesize that the&#xD;
      intervention will improve medication use and adherence among patient members with CKD on&#xD;
      complex medication treatment, and improve informal caregivers' ability to provide support for&#xD;
      improved medication use among patient members.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adherence to medications is critical in managing chronic disease, yet it remains an issue&#xD;
      across chronic conditions. Poor medication adherence leads to deteriorating health and&#xD;
      subsequently to increased costs as a result of higher hospitalizations rates. Medication&#xD;
      adherence in chronic kidney disease (CKD) is especially important because successful&#xD;
      treatment can slow the progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD), yet little research has&#xD;
      focused on adherence in patients with early CKD. Numerous barriers to medication adherence&#xD;
      exist, including the prescription of complex medication regimens, the often asymptomatic&#xD;
      nature of early CKD, and the lack of social support for treatment adherence. While technology&#xD;
      and support-based interventions show promise, there currently is no gold-standard approach to&#xD;
      improving medication adherence. Thus, it is essential to pursue novel interventions that&#xD;
      address barriers for patients with CKD to improve medication adherence and slow the&#xD;
      progression to ESRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-range goal of this application is to improve medication adherence in chronic illness&#xD;
      through the development of effective interventions that capitalize on patients'&#xD;
      medication-taking context. The objective of this application, which is the next step to&#xD;
      achieving that goal, is to pilot test the impact and acceptability of the MedMinder, a&#xD;
      pillbox device that transmits medication-taking data via a secure internet-interface to&#xD;
      patients, family members, and care managers, in a group of adult, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care&#xD;
      (HPHC) members with CKD. To achieve this objective, in partnership with HPHC, we will recruit&#xD;
      120 members with diagnosed CKD stage III or IV to participate in a 6-month pre-post&#xD;
      randomized-controlled trial. Participants will be randomized to either receive use of the&#xD;
      MedMinder over a six-month period with access to telephone care management, or receive usual&#xD;
      care of regular pillboxes with access to telephone care management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary aim is to test the feasibility and acceptability of the MedMinder intervention.&#xD;
      The main components of the intervention include: (1) a plastic weekly pill box with&#xD;
      programmable visual and auditory cues to prompt medication use, (2) generation of missed-dose&#xD;
      alerts that can be sent via email, text message, or telephone to patients, family members,&#xD;
      and HPHC care managers, (3) a secure internet site that permits customization of alerts and&#xD;
      has graphical representations of medication use, and (4) aggregate adherence reports&#xD;
      available to CKD care managers for patients who are participating in HPHC care management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary aim is to assess the impact and acceptability of family and friend involvement&#xD;
      in CKD member medication taking. We will document family and friend activities related to&#xD;
      medication taking, the acceptability of family and friend involvement in member medication&#xD;
      taking, and the impact such involvement has on medication use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings of this proposed project would provide information on the feasibility of a&#xD;
      technology-based adherence intervention, with medication-taking support, in patients with&#xD;
      chronic disease. The results from this pilot will inform a future application for a more&#xD;
      adequately powered study examining the intervention and measurement of structured support&#xD;
      from others in medication taking.&#xD;

    <description>We will calculate the proportion of days over a six month follow up period. We will calculate quantity dispensed on all chronic prescriptions filled to measure the number of days a patient had chronic medications available during the study period (&quot;days covered&quot;). Patients who switch treatment from one medication to another within the same therapeutic category will count toward adherence. Adherence is indicated by patients using &gt;80% of prescribed doses.</description>
