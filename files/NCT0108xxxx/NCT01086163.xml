  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Omacor®/Lovaza® is an effective, and very safe mix of PO-3A, and the drug is currently&#xD;
      approved by the Federal authorities for the drug management of post-infarction patients with&#xD;
      high blood triglycerides. Given the growing length of CAD progression, it is pertinent that&#xD;
      many more patients will yield extra benefit from Lovaza® on top of aggressive antiplatelet&#xD;
      regimens and statin due to severity of their vascular disease. Therefore, mild antiplatelet&#xD;
      properties of PO-3A will be a highly desirable and attractive commodity of this medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that Omacor®/Lovaza® is ideally positioned for the chronic&#xD;
      management of CAD as a safe, efficient, and &quot;gentle&quot; agent with no harmful interactions with&#xD;
      statins or aspirin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that addition of Omacor may add mild antiplatelet protection&#xD;
      for CAD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the ex vivo effects of Omacor® on platelet function in patients with coronary&#xD;
           artery disease (CAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare ex vivo platelet-related effects after 7 and 14 days of therapy with Omacor&#xD;
           and statin combination versus statin alone in patients with chronic stable coronary&#xD;
           heart disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish the relation of changes in platelet activity (if any) with the lipid&#xD;
           profile to prove an additional benefit of Omacor® on top of statin and aspirin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In terms of incidence, prevalence, morbidity, and economic costs, coronary artery disease&#xD;
      represents a number 1 public health concern. Omacor®/Lovaza® is an effective, and very safe&#xD;
      mix of PO-3A, and the drug is currently approved by the Federal authorities for the drug&#xD;
      management of post-infarction patients with high blood triglycerides. Despite significant&#xD;
      progress in the prevention and treatment of vascular disease in the Western World in the past&#xD;
      two decades, national statistics indicate that the incidence and prevalence of heart disease&#xD;
      has been increasing steadily. Given the growing length of CAD progression, it is pertinent&#xD;
      that many more patients will yield extra benefit from Lovaza® on top of aggressive&#xD;
      antiplatelet regimens and statin due to severity of their vascular disease. Therefore, mild&#xD;
      antiplatelet properties of PO-3A will be a highly desirable and attractive commodity of this&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that Omacor®/Lovaza® is ideally positioned for the chronic management of CAD as a&#xD;
      safe, efficient, and &quot;gentle&quot; agent with no harmful interactions with statins or aspirin.&#xD;
      Also considering low clinical incidence of aspirin-induced interactions with other classes of&#xD;
      drugs, Lovaza® may fit nicely into a standard cocktail for diabetes, hypertension,&#xD;
      depression, arrhythmias, and heart failure management of CAD patients, which will expand the&#xD;
      drug utilization. However, platelet-related effects of Lovaza® on top of aspirin and statin&#xD;
      in patients with stable coronary disease are not known, but may be important due to the high&#xD;
      incidence of aspirin resistance and heavy burden of thrombin activation in such patients. We&#xD;
      have a large pool of patients with documented CAD (300-350/annum), and we will be able to&#xD;
      enroll relatively large amount of quality patients fast.&#xD;

        Serial assessments of platelet characteristics from 10 patients in each of the 3 study&#xD;
        groups at 2 time points for the total of 60 platelet samples. First, patients with stable&#xD;
        coronary disease will be identified, telephone interviews will be conducted, and screening&#xD;
        visits scheduled to those who qualify. We expect to triage 50 patients who then will be&#xD;
        examined, and biochemistry markers tested. Patients will be allocated to one of three&#xD;
        treatment arms based on randomization. Enrollment will continue until all 3 cells will be&#xD;
