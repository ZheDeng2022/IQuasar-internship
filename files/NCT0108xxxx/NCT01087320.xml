      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - A number of rare inherited diseases affect only a few patients, and the genetic causes of&#xD;
      these conditions remain unknown. Researchers are studying the use of a new technology called&#xD;
      whole genome sequencing to learn which gene or genes cause these conditions. Understanding&#xD;
      the genes that cause these diseases is important to improve diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      affected patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify the genetic cause of disorders that are difficult to identify with existing&#xD;
           techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop best practices for the medical and counseling challenges of whole genome&#xD;
           sequencing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals who have one of the rare disorders under consideration in this study. These&#xD;
           conditions are generally those in which the genetic cause of the disorder is unknown.&#xD;
           The eligibility of most individual participants will be decided on a case-by-case basis&#xD;
           by the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family members of affected individuals, if that family member (often a parent) may&#xD;
           provide genetic information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants in this study will have at least one and in some cases several of the&#xD;
           following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medical genetics evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other tests that may include x-rays, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) exams, and&#xD;
           consultations with other doctors. Not all studies are necessary for each person, but the&#xD;
           information from the tests may be required to proceed with some of our gene sequencing&#xD;
           studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical photographs to document certain aspects of the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and skin biopsy samples, or other tissue samples, as required by the study&#xD;
           doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Genetic testing, as decided by the researchers. However, most participants in this study&#xD;
           can expect to undergo whole genome sequencing, which is a technique to study all of a&#xD;
           person s genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants may be asked to take part in a telephone interview and/or a web-based&#xD;
           survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have choices about what kinds of results from whole genome sequencing&#xD;
           they wish to learn.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After the tests have been completed and the results of the genetic studies are known,&#xD;
           participants will be offered a return visit to the National Institutes of Health to&#xD;
           learn these results. During this visit, participants will be asked to complete surveys&#xD;
           and participate in interviews related to their decisions to participate in the study and&#xD;
           to learn individual genetic test results.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We aim to use genome scale medical sequencing (GSMS, to include exome and whole&#xD;
&#xD;
      genome sequencing as appropriate) to discover causative molecular lesions for a set of rare,&#xD;
      severe phenotypes hypothesized to be caused by either somatic mutations, germline de novo&#xD;
      heterozygous mutations, germline inherited recessive, or germline inherited dominant&#xD;
      mutations in currently unknown or uncharacterized genes. The goal of this research is&#xD;
      threefold: to identify causative sequence variants for disorders whose molecular etiology was&#xD;
      previously unknown, to apply this insight to both the rare disorders under study and more&#xD;
      common phenotypes, and to enhance the study of mutation on a genome-wide level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to recruit approximately three to six affected individuals along with both parents&#xD;
      for each phenotype under study. Prospectively recruited trios will be brought to the NIH&#xD;
      Clinical Center for brief clinical evaluations and molecular evaluation. Each trio will be&#xD;
      consented to GSMS with the option to learn clinically relevant results, that is, those that&#xD;
      explain the disorder in question (what we refer to as the primary variant ) as well as other&#xD;
      clinically relevant findings discovered incidentally as part of the GSMS process (what we&#xD;
      refer to as secondary variants ). Participants will be offered a return visit to NIH to learn&#xD;
      these results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sequence data generated at the NIH Intramural Sequencing Center (NISC) will be screened by&#xD;
      staff in the Biesecker laboratory for sequence variants that conform to the hypothesized&#xD;
      inheritance pattern. All sequence variants deemed clinically relevant will be validated in a&#xD;
      CLIA-certified laboratory and the results returned to that participant. This protocol is&#xD;
      being designed in a way that will provide the long-term potential for pursuing many different&#xD;
      clinical projects.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        An individual who is affected with a disorder under study and is older than 4 weeks. Our&#xD;
        initial list of exemplar disorders has been discontinued; these disorders were examples of&#xD;
        those which meet the general attributes for inclusion in this protocol. As stated above,&#xD;
        individuals with disorders we choose to investigate under this protocol will generally&#xD;
        represent simplex cases with rare phenotypes whose molecular etiology is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In rare instances, we may accept DNA from deceased individuals, including DNA or other&#xD;
        saved biological specimens from deceased fetuses/neonates in accordance with Policy 400.&#xD;
        These samples may provide us exceptional opportunities to study variants and manifestations&#xD;
        of severe genetic overgrowth disorders where the fetus/neonate is unviable due to the&#xD;
        severity of manifestations. In the rare circumstance where we plan to accept samples from&#xD;
        non-viable fetuses/neonates, we may engage with pregnant mothers to begin consent&#xD;
        discussions and coordinate specimen collection. We will only enroll pregnant women who&#xD;
        voluntarily donate fetal tissue from invasive prenatal testing, and for which trio analysis&#xD;
        is appropriate and necessary. While rare, there may be circumstances in which the&#xD;
        scientific objectives (to elucidate the molecular etiology of the proband s genetic&#xD;
        condition) would not be possible without analyzing the DNA of the fetus/proband and the&#xD;
        biological parents. The conditions set under 45CFR46.205 are met for the inclusion of&#xD;
        non-viable neonates:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vital functions of the neonate will not be artificially maintained;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The research will not terminate the heartbeat or respiration of the neonate;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There will be no added risk to the neonate resulting from the research;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The purpose of the research is the development of important biomedical knowledge that&#xD;
             cannot be obtained by any other means; and&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The legally effective informed consent is obtained in accord with applicable&#xD;
             regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Family members of an affected individual where that family member (often a parent) is&#xD;
        potentially informative or useful for linkage or other bioinformatic analyses of genetic&#xD;
        variants may be enrolled. Probands who are minors or decisionally impaired adults are&#xD;
        eligible if they have a parent or legal guardian who has authority to sign a consent form&#xD;
        on their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION INCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Probands who are adults and decisionally impaired are ineligible if they do not have a&#xD;
        legal guardian who has authority to sign a consent form on their behalf.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who have known, significant affective or psychiatric disorders that, in the&#xD;
        judgment of the team, may impair their ability to understand and appropriately use complex&#xD;
        medical and genetic information will be considered decisionally-impaired and will be&#xD;
        ineligible unless they have appointed (or, in the case of minor children, are in the&#xD;
        custody of) an appropriate surrogate decision-maker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition, guardianship for cognitively impaired adult probands must be legally&#xD;
        established and proof of guardianship must be supplied prior to that family s enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We request the ability to use this protocol for multiple genetic disorders, without&#xD;
        specifically delineating them a priori. We believe this approach to be appropriate because&#xD;
        for nearly all inherited disorders, the risks and benefits of GSMS do not substantively&#xD;
        differ. This concept was validated by our now-closed protocol 94-HG-0193, which was a&#xD;
        broad-based protocol for heritable congenital anomaly disorders, many of which do not fall&#xD;
        neatly into a specific diagnostic classification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        As mentioned, we may request permission to retain some information about prospective&#xD;
        participants who, at the time of their inquiry, may not be eligible for the study but who&#xD;
        could become eligible in the future. As these participants will not be signing a consent&#xD;
        form, we propose to NOT count these participants in our Inclusion Enrollment Reports but&#xD;
        will provide the IRB with a tally of retained records at each Continuing Review.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consent documents for this protocol are available in English and Spanish. In rare&#xD;
        instances, we may enroll participants who speak other languages using the NIH Short Written&#xD;
        Consent Form Translation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        We will not enroll pregnant women, except as outlined in the section above.&#xD;
