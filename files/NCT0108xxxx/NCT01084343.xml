    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the safety and efficacy of a newly developed vaccine&#xD;
      against HIV-1 in female healthy subjects. Safety will be assessed by local and systemic&#xD;
      adverse reactions, investigations of blood and urine, and physical exam including vital sign&#xD;
      measurements. Efficacy will be assessed in blood, and in vaginal and rectal mucosal samples.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The current treatment of HIV is aimed at delaying the disease process after the body has been&#xD;
      infected with the virus. HIV treatment does not prevent the spreading of the virus to&#xD;
      uninfected people. Prevention of HIV infection could be realized by a vaccine. An effective&#xD;
      vaccine could slow down the world wide epidemic. None of the potential vaccines investigated&#xD;
      in the past 20 years could provide protection to HIV. All these vaccines were aimed at&#xD;
      stimulating an immune reaction in the blood. A new theory has been raised that protection&#xD;
      against HIV should take place at the site where the virus in most cases enters the body after&#xD;
      sexual contacts, in the vagina and rectum. Mymetics Corporation, sponsor of this clinical&#xD;
      trial, has developed a new vaccine, based on the so-called virosome technique. This vaccine&#xD;
      should be able to induce a local immune reaction in the mucosa of vagina and rectum.&#xD;
      Investigations in laboratory animals showed that the newly developed vaccine was safe and&#xD;
      well tolerated and a local immune reaction in the mucosa could be established. The next step&#xD;
      is to investigate if the concept of mucosal immunity does also apply in the human being.&#xD;
      Therefore this trial is being designed to investigate if the newly developed vaccine is also&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated in healthy subjects. In addition, it will be investigated if the&#xD;
      vaccine can induce an immune response in the mucosa of vagina and rectum. The vaccine will be&#xD;
      investigated for the first time in man. The vaccine consists of a very small part of the HIV&#xD;
      1 virus, coupled to a carrier, the virosome. The vaccine also contains two proteins of the&#xD;
      influenza virus. These are needed for stability of the vaccine and activation of the immune&#xD;
      system in general. There will be two groups of 12 healthy female subjects. In total 24&#xD;
      subjects will participate in this study. The first group will be vaccinated with a low dose&#xD;
      of the vaccine (10 microgram of peptide). If the vaccine is assessed as safe during the&#xD;
      safety reviews, the second group will be vaccinated with a high dose of vaccine (50 microgram&#xD;
      of peptide). Safety and tolerability of the high dose will also be assessed during two safety&#xD;
      reviews. Each subject will be vaccinated on four occasions, separated by eight weeks. The&#xD;
      first two vaccinations will be given in the muscles and the third and fourth vaccination will&#xD;
      be given in the nose in order to enhance the immune response in the mucosa. In both groups,&#xD;
      eight subjects will be vaccinated with the real vaccine and four subjects will be vaccinated&#xD;
      with the carrier only (placebo). Nor the investigator neither the subject will know which&#xD;
      vaccination they receive. It will be a so-called double-blinded study. Safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be assessed by the local and systemic adverse reactions. In addition, blood&#xD;
      and urine will be investigated and subjects will have a physical examination including vital&#xD;
      signs measurements. At home, subjects will complete a diary card for the registration of&#xD;
      local and systemic adverse events. The immune response in blood will be measured. For the&#xD;
      investigation of the mucosal immune response, a smear from the mucosa of vagina and rectum&#xD;
      will be taken and investigated at four visits. This will be performed with special sponges&#xD;
      and it is a painless procedure. Total duration of the study for each subject will be 32-34&#xD;
      weeks. HIV infection due to this vaccination is not possible.&#xD;
