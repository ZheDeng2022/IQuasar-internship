      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - New vaccines against avian influenza, also known as &quot;bird flu,&quot; are being developed and&#xD;
      require testing to determine if they are safe and effective and whether they have any side&#xD;
      effects. Researchers are interested in testing two experimental avian influenza vaccines to&#xD;
      see whether they are safe, if there are any side effects from the vaccines, and how the&#xD;
      body's immune response differs in response to different vaccination schedules. One vaccine is&#xD;
      an inactivated vaccine (made with killed or weakened influenza) and one is a DNA vaccine that&#xD;
      allows the body to use vaccine to make an immune system response to a specific part of an&#xD;
      avian influenza protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the safety and potential side effects of two experimental vaccines against&#xD;
           avian influenza.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate whether the time between the two experimental vaccine injections affects the&#xD;
           immune response to the vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Healthy individuals between 18 and 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be randomly divided (by chance) into six groups to receive two&#xD;
           injections of vaccine at different intervals. One group will receive only the&#xD;
           inactivated vaccine, while the other groups will receive the DNA vaccine followed by the&#xD;
           inactivated vaccine at different intervals (e.g., 4 weeks, 8 weeks, 12 weeks, 16 weeks&#xD;
           or 24 weeks later).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will remain at the clinical center for at least 30 minutes after each&#xD;
           vaccination. A few days after each injection, participants will contact staff by&#xD;
           telephone or have a clinic visit. Participants will also be asked to complete a diary&#xD;
           card at home for 5 days to keep track of temperature changes, injection site skin&#xD;
           changes, and other effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four weeks after the first injection, participants will return for a clinic visit and to&#xD;
           provide blood samples for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two weeks after the second injection, participants will return for a clinic visit and&#xD;
           provide blood samples (collected through apheresis) to provide information on immune&#xD;
           response to the vaccine.&#xD;

      An Open-Label, Randomized Phase I Study in Healthy Adults of the Safety and Immunogenicity of&#xD;
      Prime-Boost Intervals with Monovalent Influenza Subunit Virion (H5N1) Vaccine,&#xD;
      A/Indonesia/05/2005 (Sanofi Pasteur, Inc), Administered Alone or Following Recombinant DNA&#xD;
      Plasmid (H5) Vaccine, VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP (VRC, NIAID)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase I, randomized, open-label study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of prime-boost vaccination regimens against the influenza virus hemagglutinin&#xD;
      H5. One group will receive A/Indonesia/05/2005 (inactivated H5N1) vaccine as both prime and&#xD;
      boost, and the other groups will receive the VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP (DNA) vaccine as prime with&#xD;
      inactivated H5N1 boost but with various boost intervals. The VRC 310 study will provide data&#xD;
      from different prime-boost schedules to identify whether homologous or heterologous schedules&#xD;
      result in a better antibody response as well as which interval of time between vaccinations&#xD;
      is associated with the best immune response. The hypothesis is that all of the study regimens&#xD;
      will be safe for human administration and will elicit antibody and T cell responses against&#xD;
      the H5 protein. The primary objectives are to evaluate the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      investigational vaccine regimens, at a dose of 4 mg for the DNA vaccine and 90 microg for the&#xD;
      inactivated H5N1, in healthy adults. Secondary and exploratory objectives are related to the&#xD;
      immunogenicity of the study vaccine regimens and identification of an interval between prime&#xD;
      and boost that has the highest frequency of strong immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Product Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inactivated H5N1 vaccine is monovalent subunit virion vaccine, A/Indonesia/05/2005 clade&#xD;
      2, manufactured by Sanofi Pasteur, Inc (Swiftwater, PA). Vaccine vials will be supplied at 90&#xD;
      microg/0.5mL. The VRC-AVIDNA036-00-VP vaccine was developed and manufactured by VRC, NIAID&#xD;
      and is composed of a single closed-circular DNA plasmid that encodes the H5 protein with a&#xD;
      CMV/R promoter. Vaccine vials will be supplied at 4 mg/mL. Each vaccination will be&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly (IM) in the deltoid muscle using needle and syringe for the H5N1&#xD;
      vaccine and the Biojector 2000 Needle-Free Injection Management System (Biojector) for the&#xD;
      DNA vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 healthy adults, ages 18-60 years will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be simultaneously randomized equally into one of 6 groups. Subjects and&#xD;
      clinicians will be blinded to group assignment until Day 0 following completion of the&#xD;
      enrollment. At the point of enrollment the randomly assigned regimen will become known to&#xD;
      subjects and clinicians. Subjects will receive two injections on the schedule shown in the&#xD;
      schema. The protocol requires 5 or 6 clinic visits, depending upon the group, and telephone&#xD;
      follow-up contact after the first study injection and 24 weeks after the second study&#xD;
      injection. Additional optional visits may be conducted at study weeks 48 and 72 to collect&#xD;
      blood for evaluation of immune response durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will complete clinical follow up through 24 weeks after the second&#xD;
      vaccination. Duration of the expected time on study will vary from 28 to 48 weeks depending&#xD;
      upon the Group, but may be extended to 72 weeks after enrollment for subjects who agree to&#xD;
      complete the optional research blood drawas.&#xD;
