      This study will develop and evaluate the effectiveness of a technology-assisted behavioral&#xD;
      intervention, consisting of Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy combined with&#xD;
      telephone and email support, in preventing depressive symptoms and improving treatment&#xD;
      adherence in individuals at risk of major depressive disorder.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression is common, with one-year prevalence rates of major depressive disorder (MDD)&#xD;
      estimated to be between 6.6-10.3% in the general population. Depression imposes a very high&#xD;
      societal burden in terms of cost, morbidity, suffering, and mortality. Yet only about 20% of&#xD;
      all patients referred for psychotherapy ever enter treatment, and of those who initiate&#xD;
      treatment, nearly half drop out before completion. Given the limitations of treatment and the&#xD;
      significant burden of depression, research into the prevention of depression is needed. There&#xD;
      is a dearth of research related to the effective prevention of depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Delivering an intervention through telecommunication technologies, such as the telephone and&#xD;
      Internet, has the potential to overcome many of the barriers to existing depression&#xD;
      prevention interventions. For example, telephone- and Web-based interventions can reduce&#xD;
      cost, extend specialized treatment over broad geographic areas, and permit considerable&#xD;
      flexibility in scheduling of treatment components. Approaches to Improving Mood (AIM) is a&#xD;
      specific form of a telecommunication behavioral intervention that incorporates Web-based&#xD;
      Internet, e-mail, and telephone intervention. Further study is needed to determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of AIM in preventing depressive symptoms and improving attrition from treatment&#xD;
      rates in people at risk for MDD. The study will compare the effectiveness of the AIM program&#xD;
      with a one year surveillance follow up with the effectiveness of the AIM program alone and a&#xD;
      website offering information on depression prevention in preventing depressive symptoms and&#xD;
      improving treatment adherence in individuals at risk of MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the treatment phase of this study will last 12 weeks. All participants will&#xD;
      first undergo initial assessments that will include a telephone interview and a series of&#xD;
      questionnaires about mood. Eligible participants will then be assigned randomly to receive&#xD;
      AIM + surveillance, AIM alone, or the education website. All participants will undergo 12&#xD;
      weeks of a Web-based Internet intervention consisting of modules to help them learn skills to&#xD;
      manage their moods. Participants will be asked to access the Web site every day or two to&#xD;
      complete the modules and to practice the learned techniques. Participants assigned to AIM +&#xD;
      surveillance and AIM alone will also receive a weekly telephone-based motivational&#xD;
      intervention from a coach and will be able to communicate with the coach via email throughout&#xD;
      the first 12 weeks of treatment. Participants assigned to the education group will be given&#xD;
      access to a website but no assistance from a coach. All participants will undergo repeat&#xD;
      initial assessments at Weeks 6, 12 (end of treatment) and at 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and&#xD;
      12 months following the completion of treatment.&#xD;
