    <textblock>
      Several adjuvant therapies have been attempted to reduce uni-centric, and intra- or&#xD;
      extrahepatic recurrence after curative surgical resection for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC).&#xD;
      However, because the efficacy of such adjuvant therapy remains unclear, there is no standard&#xD;
      postoperative therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators investigated whether adjuvant hepatic arterial infusional chemotherapy with&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin reduces the recurrence of HCC after curative resection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignancies in the world. In&#xD;
      particular, the global occurrence rate of HCC ranks first in males and fourth in females.&#xD;
      Despite advances in diagnosis and medical, and surgical management, HCC is still considered a&#xD;
      difficult disease to cure because of the high recurrence rate, even after surgical resection.&#xD;
      The cumulative 3-year recurrence rate after resection with a curative aim is approximately&#xD;
      80%.1 Portal vein invasion and satellite nodules are important factors that predispose a&#xD;
      patient to recurrence after resection.2 More importantly, recurrence after resection usually&#xD;
      results in a high rate of mortality.3 Uni-centric or intrahepatic metastatic recurrence&#xD;
      usually indicates metastatic spread from the primary tumor and is generally distinguished&#xD;
      from multi-centric recurrence by a short interval between resection and recurrence (12 months&#xD;
      for primary tumor spreading vs. 3 years for multi-centric recurrence).4,5 In this regard,&#xD;
      several adjuvant therapies have been used to attempt to primarily reduce uni-centric, and&#xD;
      intra- or extrahepatic recurrence after curative surgical resection for HCC. However, because&#xD;
      the efficacy of adjuvant therapy after curative resection is still not clear, no&#xD;
      recommendation for postoperative therapy exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several chemotherapeutic agents, including doxorubicin, epirubicin, mitomycin C,&#xD;
      5-fluorouracil (5-FU), and cisplatin have been delivered into the hepatic artery via an&#xD;
      implanted port system as the first-line regimen or adjuvant therapy after curative resection&#xD;
      in HCC.6-8 A recent study reported that repetitive short-course hepatic arterial infusion of&#xD;
      5-FU and cisplatin showed significant anti-tumor effects in advanced HCC.9 With the&#xD;
      hypothesis that post-operative chemotherapeutic agents delivered via the hepatic artery may&#xD;
      eliminate residual cancer cells in the liver, we designed a prospective study to determine&#xD;
      whether adjuvant hepatic arterial infusional chemotherapy (HAIC) with 5-FU and cisplatin&#xD;
      reduced the incidence of recurrence of HCC and improved overall patient survival after&#xD;
      curative resection.&#xD;
