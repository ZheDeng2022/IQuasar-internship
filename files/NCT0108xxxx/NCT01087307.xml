      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Researchers are interested in developing a registry protocol to obtain biologic and&#xD;
      environmental samples anonymously from adult volunteers for use in laboratory tests and&#xD;
      studies. The samples will be used to determine if new tests are sufficiently valid and&#xD;
      precise to be used in research studies and for quality control purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To provide a registry of samples for test development, validation, analysis, and quality&#xD;
      control at the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Male and nonpregnant female volunteers at least 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples to be collected will include blood, urine, saliva, household dust, cheek cells,&#xD;
           hair, nasal cells, stool, nail clippings, exhaled breath condensate, or sperm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specimens may be collected during a one-time sample collection, or participants may be&#xD;
           asked to provide specimens on several occasions over a specified period, not to exceed 1&#xD;
           year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eligible participants will be asked to come to the clinical research unit to have their&#xD;
           blood drawn and any noninvasive samples retrieved. Prior to blood draw, researchers will&#xD;
           administer a brief past 24-hour questionnaire for research purposes. Specimens will be&#xD;
           collected using standard clinical protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will receive monetary compensation for providing samples for this protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We propose a sample collection registry protocol for use in obtaining biologic and&#xD;
      environmental samples anonymously from adult volunteers for use in laboratory assay&#xD;
      evaluation. The samples will be used to determine if new tests are sufficiently valid and&#xD;
      precise to be used in research studies and for quality control purposes. In studies involving&#xD;
      the storage and analysis of laboratory specimens, it is essential to evaluate the performance&#xD;
      of available assays and to actively assess the impact of storage and handling on the quality&#xD;
      of samples and laboratory analyses. Specifically, it is essential to 1) demonstrate that an&#xD;
      assay is sufficiently reproducible and stable over time such that differences in levels among&#xD;
      individuals in the population can be detected; 2) evaluate assay reliability by sending&#xD;
      blinded anonymous samples along with study samples to testing labs for quality control&#xD;
      purposes; 3) test proposed laboratories or methods by using replicate samples from the&#xD;
      population in order to choose the laboratory or method with the greater precision, and; 4)&#xD;
      assess how sample collection, handling, and storage procedures affect measured levels of&#xD;
      specific analytes to allow for informed decisions about whether to proceed with a specific&#xD;
      analysis. Under this protocol, assays could include evaluation of immunologic parameters,&#xD;
      genes and gene products, peptides, proteins, hormones, lipids, viability of cells,&#xD;
      evaporation and dilution effects, chemical toxins and their metabolites, micronutrients,&#xD;
      metals and more. For some samples, lymphocytes will be extracted for use in studies of&#xD;
      lymphocytes and/or immortalized cells. Samples to be collected will include blood, urine,&#xD;
      saliva, household dust, cheek cells, hair, nasal cells, stool, nail clippings, exhaled breath&#xD;
      condensate, sperm samples, skin cells, and/or sputum. In addition, a pulmonary function test&#xD;
      (PFT) may be conducted to collect lung function information. Since it is important to collect&#xD;
      samples from the general population, this protocol covers collection of samples from&#xD;
      non-pregnant adults (male and female, age 18+). Specimens may be collected during a one-time&#xD;
      sample collection, or participants may be asked to provide specimens on several occasions&#xD;
      over a specified period, not to exceed one year.&#xD;
