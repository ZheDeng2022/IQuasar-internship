      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as cellular adoptive immunotherapy, may stimulate the&#xD;
      immune system in different ways and stop tumor cells from growing. Donor T cells that are&#xD;
      treated in the laboratory may be effective treatment for malignant glioma. Aldesleukin may&#xD;
      stimulate the white blood cells to kill tumor cells. Combining different types of biological&#xD;
      therapies may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best way to give therapeutic&#xD;
      donor lymphocytes together with aldesleukin in treating patients with stage III or stage IV&#xD;
      malignant glioma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety of GRm13Z40-2 CTL CNS loco-regional cellular immunotherapy in&#xD;
      research participants with recurrent or refractory/ progressive malignant glioma (WHO Grades&#xD;
      3 or 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety of convection enhanced delivery (CED) of recombinant human&#xD;
      Interleukin-2 (rhuIL-2) used in conjunction with GRm13Z40-2 CTL adoptive transfer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate the ability of 9-(4-fluoro-3-hydroxy-methyl-butyl) guanine (18FHBG)&#xD;
      positron emission tomography PET to image GRm13Z40-2 CTL's in research participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To study the impact of concurrent dexamethasone administration on the tempo and magnitude&#xD;
      of T cell allograft rejection responses in treated research participants by tracking the&#xD;
      frequency of anti-GRm13Z40-2 immune responses in serially acquired peripheral blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate ganciclovir administration for ablating transferred GRm13Z40-2 in vivo&#xD;
      should significant graft-mediated toxicities be encountered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients receive GRm13Z40-2 therapeutic allogeneic lymphocytes intratumorally (IT)&#xD;
      over 10 minutes on days 1 and 3 and aldesleukin IT over 3 hours on days 2-5 (days 1-5 in week&#xD;
      2). Treatment repeats every week for 2 courses in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed annually for at least 15 years.&#xD;
