      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of 2 different&#xD;
      combinations of drugs that can be given to patients with advanced cancer. The first&#xD;
      combination of drugs is Tykerb (lapatinib) and Rapamune (sirolimus), and the second&#xD;
      combination is lapatinib and Glucophage (metformin). The safety of these drug combinations&#xD;
      will also be studied.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lapatinib is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking 2&#xD;
      proteins on the surface of the cancer cell, which are HER 1 and HER 2 receptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sirolimus is designed to block a protein called mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) (a&#xD;
      protein that is thought to cause cancer cells to grow) inside the cancer cell. This may&#xD;
      interfere with the growth or spread of cancer cells or possibly kill the cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metformin was designed to treat patients with diabetes. It may be able to block mTOR and slow&#xD;
      the growth of tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide if you&#xD;
      will receive lapatinib with metformin or lapatinib with sirolimus. Once it is decided which&#xD;
      combination you will receive, you will be assigned to a dose level based on when you join the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 7 dose levels of lapatinib with sirolimus will be tested. Up to 6 dose levels of&#xD;
      lapatinib with metformin will be tested. Three (3) to 6 participants will be enrolled at each&#xD;
      dose level. The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new&#xD;
      group will receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects&#xD;
      were seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of the combination of&#xD;
      lapatinib with either sirolimus or metformin is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerated dose of the combination of lapatinib with either sirolimus or&#xD;
      metformin is found, 14 participants with the tumor type that has responded to the study drug&#xD;
      combination will receive the study drugs at that dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study &quot;cycle&quot; is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take lapatinib by mouth 1 time each day. You should take it at about the same time&#xD;
      each day on an empty stomach with a cup (about 8 ounces) of water, 1 hour before and 2 hours&#xD;
      after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are also taking metformin, you will take it by mouth 1 time every day. You should take&#xD;
      it at about the same time each day with a meal and cup of water (about 8 ounces).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are also taking sirolimus, you will take it by mouth 1 time every day. You should take&#xD;
      it at about the same time each day on an empty stomach with a cup of water, 1 hour before and&#xD;
      2 hours after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every study visit, you will be asked about any current health conditions you have, any&#xD;
      other drugs you are taking, and if you have experienced any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On about Days 1, 8, and 15 of Cycle 1, blood (about 2 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On about Day 1 Cycle 1, urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On about Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) drawn or urine collected for&#xD;
      pregnancy test if you are able to become pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 8 weeks for the first 4 cycles, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, and/or&#xD;
      PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease. If the study doctor thinks it is needed, they&#xD;
      will be performed more often. After 4 cycles you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan,&#xD;
      and/or PET/CT scan every 8 - 12 weeks as your study if the study doctor feels it is&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may stay on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study if you&#xD;
      experience intolerable side effects, the study doctor thinks it is in your best interest, or&#xD;
      the disease gets worse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Sirolimus is FDA approved and commercially available as an&#xD;
      anti-rejection drug for kidney transplant recipients. Lapatinib is FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available for the treatment of advanced breast cancer. Metformin is FDA approved&#xD;
      and commercially available for the treatment of diabetes mellitus. The combination of these&#xD;
      drugs to treat advanced cancer is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 106 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;
