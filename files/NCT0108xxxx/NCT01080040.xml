  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is observational, non-controlled, multicentric and prospective, without&#xD;
      experimental intervention or control. As part of the usual management of the subjects, scales&#xD;
      will be used for the assessment of the spasticity and the quality of life (QoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this observational study is to assess the incidence of spasticity in a group&#xD;
      of subjects with Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis (RRMS) in Argentina and the way it&#xD;
      affects the QoL of these subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of most frequently observed symptoms in subjects with MS is spasticity. Spasticity is&#xD;
      defined as an abnormal velocity-dependent increase in muscle tonic stretch reflexes due to an&#xD;
      amplified reactivity of motor segments to sensory input. It is part of one of the components&#xD;
      of the superior motoneurone syndrome and it may cause muscle rigidity and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The spasticity, which could be measured in electrophysiological, biomechanical and clinical&#xD;
      terms, has a significant prevalence. It is a frequent cause for consultation among subjects&#xD;
      with MS and, consequently, has a significant impact on the QoL. Men and those subjects with&#xD;
      MS of longer duration are the most affected by spasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to assess the impact that spasticity has on the QoL of subjects with&#xD;
      MS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total duration of the study is 24 months. The recruiting period will be 12 months. Once&#xD;
      the recruiting time is over, the collection of data will continue during the full 24 months&#xD;
      period that was planned.&#xD;
