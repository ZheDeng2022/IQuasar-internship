      The purpose of this research study is to test the safety and effectiveness of the SCOUT DS in&#xD;
      measuring the concentration of substances (advanced glycation endproducts) in the skin. These&#xD;
      substances have been found to be in higher concentrations in people with diabetes and high&#xD;
      blood sugar. The SCOUT DS is being developed to help doctors measure these substances in skin&#xD;
      and possibly help doctors diagnose diabetes.&#xD;

      The trial will be a prospective, multi-center, paired data, cohort screening trial. Up to 960&#xD;
      subjects will complete the study to determine the relative accuracy of SCOUT DS compared to&#xD;
      the FPG and HbA1c tests in screening for abnormal glucose tolerance. All methods will be&#xD;
      compared to the 2 hour value of the OGTT. An algorithm utilizes skin optical modeling as well&#xD;
      as the spectral and blood assay data accumulated from the initial phase of the study to&#xD;
      produce a risk score for abnormal glucose tolerance. This algorithm and the calculation of&#xD;
      the score will be integrated into the SCOUT DS for prospective testing. The design requires&#xD;
      three patient visits to the clinical site and up to a total of seven measurements on the&#xD;
      SCOUT device.&#xD;

        Volunteers age 18 and above, of either sex and of any ethnic background, will be recruited&#xD;
        at up to 12 clinical sites. All subjects will be at risk for diabetes based on the American&#xD;
        Diabetes Association Standard of Care Guidelines. Those in the 18-44 age group will have an&#xD;
        additional risk factor, and the addition of the waist circumference and hypertension&#xD;
        thresholds from the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III&#xD;
