      After consultation with the Korean Health Authorities, the two Post-Authorization Safety&#xD;
      Studies EMR 62202-509 (NCT01082315) and EMR 62241-508 (NCT01075828) were combined within one&#xD;
      study protocol EMR 062202-551. This Post-Marketing Surveillance Study (PMS) EMR 062202-551 is&#xD;
      requested by the Korean Health Authorities to continue monitoring of Erbitux and provide&#xD;
      further information about safety and toxicity in clinical practice in at least 900 patients&#xD;
      during 6 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data points from the EMR 62202-509 (NCT01082315) and EMR 62241-508 (NCT01075828) remain&#xD;
      unchanged in protocol EMR 062202-551. Therefore, the Sponsor has decided not to separately&#xD;
      disclose the EMR 062202-551 study titled &quot;A Korean Post-Marketing Surveillance Study On&#xD;
      Erbitux® (Cetuximab) in Patients With Locally Advanced or Recurrent and/or Metastatic&#xD;
      Squamous Cell Cancer of the Head and Neck (originally EMR 62241-508) and in Patients With&#xD;
      EGFR-expressing, KRAS wild-type Metastatic Colorectal Cancer (originally EMR 62202-509)&quot; on&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a post marketing surveillance (PMS), prospective study to collect safety information&#xD;
      from more than 600 subjects with epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR)-expressing,&#xD;
      V-Ki-ras2 Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) wild-type metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer (mCRC) treated with Erbitux as final evaluable cases. This PMS is requested by the&#xD;
      Korean Regulatory Authorities because after removal of an orphan drug in Korea, there is a&#xD;
      requirement to investigate more than 600 patients during six years, to continue monitoring&#xD;
      and provide further information about safety and toxicity in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This PMS study is planned to be conducted within 6 years from the removal date of orphan drug&#xD;
      in approximately 50 institutions in Korea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the study is to analyse the safety and efficacy information on the use of&#xD;
      Erbitux in the market and factors affecting its safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain safety information on the use of Erbitux in subjects with mCRC in terms of&#xD;
           frequency and severity of adverse events (AEs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gather clinical efficacy information of the treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the PMS period, each subject's background, medical history (surgery, radiotherapy),&#xD;
      Erbitux treatment status, concurrent medication, response evaluation, status and reason of&#xD;
      discontinuation, all AEs (regardless of the causal relationship to Erbitux), and abnormal&#xD;
      results of laboratory tests will be collected from the start of treatment with Erbitux until&#xD;
      progressive disease, Erbitux-related intolerable toxicities, death, or withdrawal of Erbitux&#xD;
      treatment (whichever occurs first). The primary endpoint, the safety evaluation will be based&#xD;
      on all cases treated with Erbitux having received at least one dose. However, for efficacy&#xD;
      evaluation, 12 weeks of treatment have to be applied to each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erbitux will be prescribed to mCRC subjects according to the approved national label as in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice, under the supervision of an investigator experienced in the use of&#xD;
      antineoplastic medicinal products. Prior to the first infusion, subjects will receive&#xD;
      pre-medication with an antihistamine and a corticosteroid. The initial dose of Erbitux is 400&#xD;
      mg/m2 body surface area and the subsequent weekly doses are 250 mg/m2 each administered&#xD;
      intravenously via in-line filtration with an infusion pump, gravity drip, or a syringe pump.&#xD;
      The recommended infusion period for the initial dose is 120 minutes and for the subsequent&#xD;
      weekly doses is 60 minutes with the maximum infusion rate not exceeding 10 mg/min, equivalent&#xD;
      to 5 ml/min of Erbitux 2 mg/ml.&#xD;
