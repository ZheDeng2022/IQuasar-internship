      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as ixabepilone, work in different ways to stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing or&#xD;
      by stopping them from spreading. Vorinostat may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking&#xD;
      some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving ixabepilone together with vorinostat may&#xD;
      kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase I trial is studying the side effects, best way to give, and&#xD;
      best dose of vorinostat when given together with ixabepilone in treating patients with breast&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to another place in the body.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of vorinostat with&#xD;
      ixabepilone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the best schedule for delivery of this drug combination. III. To recommend a&#xD;
      phase II dose of vorinostat in combination with ixabepilone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the objective response rate and/or clinical benefit rate. II. To assess the&#xD;
      toxicity profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Collecting circulating tumor cells pre and post-treatment to study its deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid (DNA) somatic mutation and methylation assay after the introduction of histone&#xD;
      deacetylases (HDAC) inhibitors and ixabepilone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine whether administration of vorinostat with ixabepilone will alter the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of vorinostat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of vorinostat. Patients are randomized to 1&#xD;
      of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm I (Cohort A): Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-14 and ixabepilone&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on day 2. Courses repeat every 21 days in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm II (Cohort B): Patients receive oral vorinostat once daily on days 1-7 and 15-21.&#xD;
      Patients also receive ixabepilone IV over 3 hours on days 2, 9, and 16. Courses repeat every&#xD;
      28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;

             become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she&#xD;
             should inform her treating physician immediately and the patient will be withdrawn&#xD;
             from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patient of childbearing potential is willing to use 2 adequate barrier methods&#xD;
