  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of this project is to determine the impact of a daily intake of one half&#xD;
      ounce of lyophilized meat between 6-18 months of age (0.5 oz for 6-12 mo; 0.75 oz for 12-18&#xD;
      mo) on linear growth velocity, zinc and iron intakes and status, brain growth and&#xD;
      neurocognitive development, and infectious disease morbidity in populations traditionally&#xD;
      dependent on non-micronutrient fortified plant foods for complementary feeding.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inadequate and inappropriate complementary feeding are major factors contributing to excess&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality in young children. Prominent among nutrient inadequacies are those of&#xD;
      iron and zinc. While huge campaigns are being mounted to fortify complementary foods and to&#xD;
      distribute supplements, the effectiveness of these programs is generally uncertain and they&#xD;
      do not reach millions of rural poor. By comparison, little support is being given to local&#xD;
      food-based solutions. These not only require diversity of plant foods but appear to require&#xD;
      the inclusion of meat to achieve zinc and iron requirements. Local supplies of meat are&#xD;
      achievable but only with a concerted international and local effort. To justify this effort&#xD;
      requires a multi-site efficacy study, the results of which, if positive, will leave no doubt&#xD;
      that the effort required to provide sustainable local sources of meat for complementary feeds&#xD;
      is worthwhile. The principal hypothesis to be tested is that daily intake of beef (1 oz/d for&#xD;
      6-12 mo and 1.5 oz/d for 12-18 mo) added to usual primarily plant-derived complementary feeds&#xD;
      plus selected repetitive nutrition education messages results in greater linear growth&#xD;
      velocity than does a micronutrient (including Zn and Fe) fortified equi-caloric cereal/legume&#xD;
      supplement plus the same educational messages. Participants from four sites in the Global&#xD;
      Network which have stunting rates &gt; 20%, i.e. Guatemala, Pakistan and Zambia will be&#xD;
      randomized by clusters to receive either Â½ oz lyophilized beef (equivalent to 1 oz cooked&#xD;
      beef)/d or the equi-caloric micronutrient-fortified plant-based supplement (both increasing&#xD;
      by 50% at age 1 year). Both groups will receive three repetitive messages delivered by study&#xD;
      coordinators and through the local health system as part of integrated health care. These&#xD;
      are: provide a thick puree/gruel; feed complementary foods at least three times per day; and&#xD;
      maximize dietary diversity. These interventions will be preceded by messages to promote&#xD;
      exclusive breast feeding until 6 months and to start complementary feeding promptly at that&#xD;
      time as far as possible. The meat or fortified cereal supplement will be provided daily in a&#xD;
      group setting for each cluster; as necessary the food intervention and messages will be&#xD;
      delivered at home by the assigned community coordinator or alternate. Outcome measures,&#xD;
      obtained by a separate group of local, trained assessment workers, include: longitudinal&#xD;
      linear growth between 6-18 months (primary outcome); weight and head circumference;&#xD;
      assessment of dietary variety and diversity at 6,9,12, and 18 months; indices of iron, zinc&#xD;
      and Vitamin B12 status at 18 months; neurocognitive development at 18 months; and incidence&#xD;
      of diarrhea and lower respiratory infections. A positive multi-country, multi-culture outcome&#xD;
      of this trial will demonstrate the efficacy of a regular intake of meat commencing at age 6&#xD;
      months to achieve nutritionally complete complementary feeding and will provide a strong&#xD;
      rationale for global efforts to enhance local supplies of meat and achieve acceptance of&#xD;
      meats as complementary food.&#xD;
