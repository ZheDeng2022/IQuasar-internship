      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as contrast-enhanced CT scan and contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      MRI, may help find liver cancer and find out how far the disease has spread.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This clinical trial is studying contrast-enhanced CT scan and contrast-enhanced MRI&#xD;
      in diagnosing and staging liver cancer in patients with chronic liver disease.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the sensitivity of multiphase contrast-enhanced CT scan to that of multiphase&#xD;
           contrast-enhanced MRI using non-specific contrast agents for diagnosing hepatocellular&#xD;
           carcinoma (HCC) in patients with chronic liver disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the positive predictive value (PPV) of CT scan to that of MRI for diagnosing&#xD;
           HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the lesion-level sensitivity and PPV of CT scan and MRI as interpreted by&#xD;
           radiologists at the respective transplant centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the sensitivity and specificity of multiphase contrast-enhanced CT scan vs&#xD;
           MRI for diagnosing residual or recurrent HCC after local ablative therapy in patients&#xD;
           listed for liver transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the accuracy of imaging-based diagnosis and staging of HCC in clinical&#xD;
           practice using the new Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)&#xD;
           liver-imaging criteria compared with the reference standard of pathologic diagnosis and&#xD;
           staging at the time of explantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore whether the comparisons of sensitivity and PPV are affected by stratifying&#xD;
           patients by AFP level (elevated vs normal). (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tertiary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the sensitivity and PPV of MRI and CT interpreted at the participating sites&#xD;
           on the basis of all available information and sequences and compare the sensitivity and&#xD;
           PPV of the two modalities interpreted using the main study criterion. (Exploratory)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified according to AFP level&#xD;
      (elevated vs normal).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo CT scan with iodinated contrast agent and MRI with extracellular gadolinium&#xD;
      contrast agent (both standard-of-care and study-related) at baseline and at 90-day intervals&#xD;
      while on the liver transplant wait list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After transplantation, the explanted liver will be analyzed for biomarkers and other studies.&#xD;
