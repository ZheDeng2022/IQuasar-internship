  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an observational, non-controlled, multicentric, prospective study planned to be&#xD;
      conducted in 66 subjects diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS) in 20 centres of Argentina.&#xD;
      Fatigue is recognized as one of the most frequent symptoms of MS with a high incidence in MS&#xD;
      subjects. The link between fatigue and the degree of disability and other manifestations of&#xD;
      the disease, such as depression has not been yet clearly understood. Hence, this study aims&#xD;
      to understand the way in which fatigue impairs the quality of life (QoL) of MS subjects. This&#xD;
      epidemiologic study can contribute to a better understanding of the way in which fatigue&#xD;
      correlates with depression and the intensity with which both situations impact on the QoL of&#xD;
      MS subjects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fatigue is recognized as one of the most frequent symptoms of MS and its impact on QoL of&#xD;
      subjects is high. Fatigue in MS is sometimes considered as a prodromic symptom or as a&#xD;
      peculiar symptom that must be differentiated from natural fatigue, pathological fatigue of&#xD;
      other chronic diseases; as well as from fatigue caused by the excessive effort in case of&#xD;
      gait disorder, spasticity or paresis. The origin of the fatigue symptom in MS is unknown and&#xD;
      the cause is likely to be multifactorial. The evaluation of the fatigue is challenging, due&#xD;
      to its variability and hence, scales such as Krupp's Fatigue Severity Scale (FSS) has been&#xD;
      developed for measuring MS fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the impact of fatigue on QoL of MS subjects in Argentina&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate correlation between FSS and disability, depression, demographic variables;&#xD;
           and between FSS and the use of disease modifying drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the impact of depression and neurological disability on QoL of MS subjects&#xD;
           in Argentina&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be managed with the clinical and therapeutic elements that the treating&#xD;
      doctor considers appropriate, without modifying their decisions due to the subject inclusion&#xD;
      into the study. The epidemiologic data required by this study will be collected by the&#xD;
      investigator from the documents in which each subject visit is registered, whether programmed&#xD;
      or not. Once the recruiting period of 12 months is over, the collection of data will continue&#xD;
      during the full 24 months period for each subject. The closure of the study will be marked by&#xD;
      the follow-up of the last subject who entered the study.&#xD;
