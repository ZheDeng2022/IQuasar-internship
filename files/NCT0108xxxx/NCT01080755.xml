      This is a multicentric, longitudinal, observational study with the prospective follow-up of&#xD;
      Adult subjects with Growth Hormone Deficiency (AGHD) being treated with Saizen, every six&#xD;
      months in the first year and then annually. At the request of health authorities, the sponsor&#xD;
      has arranged for the follow-up of prescriptions and treated subjects within the scope of this&#xD;
      indication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adult growth hormone deficiency can lead to various effects. In some subjects, an increase is&#xD;
      observed in the body fat mass and often, there is an increase in blood lipid levels, which&#xD;
      also leads to an increase in risk of death by cardiovascular diseases. Sometimes muscle mass&#xD;
      is reduced, thus affecting physical performances, which cannot be rectified by exercise&#xD;
      alone. And finally, there is a decline in bone density, which increases the risk of&#xD;
      fractures. In general, most of the subjects with inadequate growth hormone secretion also&#xD;
      show a deficiency in other hormones secreted by the hypophysis (pituitary gland). In spite of&#xD;
      an adequate substitution of the possible related hormonal deficiency, these subjects also&#xD;
      present psychomotor retardation, decrease in tonus and vitality, emotional lability, a&#xD;
      feeling of social isolation and sexual problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, marketing approval had been granted to different recombinant growth hormones (GH),&#xD;
      including Saizen, for treating AGHD subjects. The indication of Saizen in adults is as&#xD;
      follows: marked deficiency in GH documented by a dynamic test indicating somatotroph&#xD;
      deficiency. The therapeutic benefits of Saizen as well as its good tolerance has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in the marketing approval indications. It has been shown that this treatment&#xD;
      results in a significant improvement in the body composition and cardiac function of AGHD&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the marketing approval for Saizen on the basis of this indication in adults,&#xD;
      the sponsor, has set-up a study in France, at the request of health authorities, to ensure a&#xD;
      follow-up of the prescriptions and treated subjects in the use of Saizen post marketing&#xD;
      approval. This request of the health authorities is also mentioned in the Treatment&#xD;
      Information Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To ensure the longitudinal follow-up of GH-deficient adult subjects treated with Saizen&#xD;
           in France, with the description:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. of the terms and conditions of prescription,&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. of the demographic and clinical characteristics of subjects,&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. of subjects' compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. of product tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data collected in this study will concern the demography, medical history, clinical and&#xD;
      biological characteristics of the subjects, the terms and conditions of prescription of&#xD;
      Saizen, its tolerance and subjects' compliance. The information will be gathered by all&#xD;
      hospital endocrinologist (approximately 200 potential prescribing doctors in France). The&#xD;
      prescribing doctor shall care for the subjects on account of the treatment and for medical&#xD;
      reasons as per his/her regular practice. The period of inclusion of subjects in the cohort is&#xD;
      3 years. The extension of this inclusion period will be discussed with the health authorities&#xD;
      during the third year of inclusion. The follow-up period for each subject included will be 5&#xD;
      years. This follow-up will be carried out at regular intervals of 6 months in the first year&#xD;
      (2 intermediate visits before 6 months are also available) and then of 12 months in the&#xD;
      subsequent years.&#xD;
