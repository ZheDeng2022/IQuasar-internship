      The purpose of this study is to determine the impact of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine on&#xD;
      carriage of pneumococcus in the nasopharynx and on the incidence of invasive pneumococcal&#xD;
      disease in the community.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pneumococcus is a bacterium that healthy people commonly have in their nose and throat; this&#xD;
      is called pneumococcal 'carriage'. Carriage is usually harmless, but can progress to serious&#xD;
      disease like pneumonia, meningitis, and blood stream infections or to less serious, but&#xD;
      burdensome, diseases like sinusitis or ear infections. Infants and the elderly bear the&#xD;
      greatest burden of pneumococcal disease with over 800,000 annual global deaths from this germ&#xD;
      among children under 5 years of age. Furthermore, pneumococcus has developed resistance to&#xD;
      antibiotics making it increasingly difficult to treat pneumococcal infections. Within the&#xD;
      United States some Native American groups, like the Navajo and the White Mountain Apache&#xD;
      tribes, suffer from pneumococcal disease much more often than people in the general US&#xD;
      population. We don't know why pneumococcus disproportionately afflicts these communities, but&#xD;
      we know this health disparity can be significantly reduced through vaccination. In 2000, for&#xD;
      the first time a pneumococcal vaccine designed specifically for infants, called PCV7, became&#xD;
      available and was put into routine use among Navajo and Apache as well as the general US&#xD;
      population. PCV7 contains the 7 most common of the &gt;90 pneumococcal strains that exist.&#xD;
      Although PCV7 is only given to infants and toddlers, it impacts pneumococcal disease&#xD;
      throughout the community because it not only protects vaccinated infants from disease it also&#xD;
      protects them against NP colonization. Infants and children are the main transmitters of&#xD;
      pneumococcal colonization in the community so any change in their carriage affects the whole&#xD;
      population of pneumococcal germs circulating within the family and community. Reductions in&#xD;
      pneumococcal disease caused by the 7 types in PCV7 have exceeded expectations, especially&#xD;
      among Navajo and Apache where we have seen virtually no cases in over 5 years. But, PCV7 has&#xD;
      had the unintended consequence of increasing the amount of pneumococcal disease from some&#xD;
      pneumococcal types that are not in PCV7. Therefore a new vaccine to protect against 13&#xD;
      pneumococcal strains, called PCV13, has been developed and is about to be licensed and used&#xD;
      (expected licensure Q4/2009). This project aims to reveal the impact of PCV13 on pneumococcal&#xD;
      disease and carriage of strains which move from person to person within the Navajo community.&#xD;
      We specifically intend to find out if use of PCV13 has an effect on disease and carriage of&#xD;
      the 6 additional strains in the vaccine and to find out if PCV13 will result in the emergence&#xD;
      of new pneumococcal serotypes within the community, like PCV7 did. This information will&#xD;
      allow us to design vaccine strategies to meet these new patterns of pneumococcal disease and&#xD;
      stay at least one step ahead of the organism changes. It will also provide the evidence on&#xD;
      which rational policies for PCV13 use among Navajo can be made. This has been essential&#xD;
      information in past experiences of vaccine shortages, where Navajo communities were given&#xD;
      priority for vaccine use. We also propose to explore the correlations between pneumococcal&#xD;
      colonization and viral infection of the nasopharynx to establish if there is enhanced risk of&#xD;
      pneumococcal colonization in the setting of viral co-infection and if that enhances the risk&#xD;
      of developing disease. To achieve the overall objectives we propose pulling together three&#xD;
      types of information (1) effect of PCV13 on nasopharyngeal colonization with pneumococcus and&#xD;
      viral pathogens (2) effect of PCV13 on disease and (3) use of PCV13 in the community.&#xD;

        The target population for the nasopharyngeal study is American Indian children 7-24 months&#xD;
        of age (index child) and their adult and child household members who reside in the&#xD;
        Whiteriver, Shiprock, Chinle, Fort Defiance and Gallup service units on the White Mountain&#xD;
        Apache and Navajo reservations. In addition those children and adults who have close&#xD;
        contact with the index child but may not live in the same household as the child are&#xD;
        eligible to participate. This may be relatives or close contacts of the index child who&#xD;
        reside in the same family compound (a compound is a group of homes in close proximity to&#xD;
        each other) but do not live in the same household as the index child.&#xD;
