      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor&#xD;
      cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving chemotherapy&#xD;
      after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery. It is not yet known whether&#xD;
      chemotherapy is more effective when given alone or together with surgery in treating patients&#xD;
      with colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized phase II/III trial is studying how well chemotherapy works and&#xD;
      compares it with surgery followed by chemotherapy in treating patients with metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer that can not be removed by surgery.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether overall survival is improved in patients with asymptomatic,&#xD;
           unresectable metastatic colorectal cancer treated with chemotherapy alone versus surgery&#xD;
           followed by chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (control arm): Patients receive systemic chemotherapy according to standard local&#xD;
           practice. Patients who develop symptoms from their primary tumor receive treatment as&#xD;
           required including surgery, if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (experimental arm): Patients undergo surgery at the discretion of the surgeon.&#xD;
           Beginning 8 weeks after completion of surgery, patients receive chemotherapy according&#xD;
           to standard local practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete quality-of-life questionnaires (EQ-5D) at baseline and then periodically&#xD;
      during and after completion of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 months.&#xD;
