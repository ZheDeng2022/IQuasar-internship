      The purpose of this study is to use an experimental diagnostic tool(NIRS), combined with a&#xD;
      known screening tool (cranial ultrasound), to analyze and evaluate cerebral blood flow and&#xD;
      oxygenation, and determine if abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes can be predicted and&#xD;
      potentially improved upon in pediatric patients undergoing repair for congenital heart&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      Purpose: There are 4 objectives for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine if the use of cranial ultrasound and multi-source-detector near infrared&#xD;
           spectroscopy can identify alterations in cerebral perfusion that are associated with&#xD;
           long-term neurologic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate whether changes in resistive indices as determined by cranial ultrasound after&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary bypass are associated with major neurologic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Describe regional changes in brain tissue oxygenation during selective cerebral&#xD;
           perfusion using near-infrared spectroscopy and determine if there are critical&#xD;
           thresholds that correlate with poor neurologic outcomes. To accomplish this, we will&#xD;
           describe differences in cerebral blood flow and oxygenation as related to structural&#xD;
           anatomy of the heart. Specifically, we will compare single ventricle and two ventricle&#xD;
           hearts with regards to use of cardiopulmonary bypass with or without selective cerebral&#xD;
           perfusion. We will also determine if a prolonged reduction in cerebral oxygenation&#xD;
           intraoperatively is associated with ultrasound-diagnosed periventricular leukomalacia at&#xD;
           discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Prospectively collect patients' DNA to determine if differences exist in neurologic&#xD;
           outcomes that are associated with genetic variation. Specifically, we will look at&#xD;
           simple karyotyping, single nucleotide polymorphisms, and copy number variation&#xD;
           differences between patients. This DNA will be collected and stored for future&#xD;
           comparison with other children with congenital heart disease who undergo&#xD;
           neurodevelopmental testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of congenital heart disease is at least 10 per 1000 live born children and&#xD;
      children with congenital heart disease are at high risk for developing neurologic&#xD;
      abnormalities1. Patients with a single ventricle have a mean full scale IQ between 89-97 and&#xD;
      the incidence of severe mental retardation in hypoplastic left heart syndrome is as high as&#xD;
      18%2, 3. The factors influencing this risk are multiple and include preoperative,&#xD;
      intraoperative, and postoperative events. One major risk factor is the use of deep&#xD;
      hypothermic circulatory arrest (DHCA), which has historically been employed to obtain a&#xD;
      bloodless operating field for aortic arch reconstruction. Since it is becoming increasingly&#xD;
      evident that there is no safe duration of DHCA, newly developed strategies are aimed at&#xD;
      maximizing cerebral blood flow and thereby improving neurologic outcomes4-7. One such&#xD;
      strategy that has been widely employed is selective cerebral perfusion (SCP), which increases&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow via a dedicated brain cannula advanced into the right common carotid&#xD;
      artery during aortic arch reconstruction.8 This technique, which decreases the period of&#xD;
      cerebral ischemia, has been shown in animal models to improve neurologic outcome, but similar&#xD;
      studies have not been performed in humans9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that cerebral vascular resistance is increased after DHCA and it has been&#xD;
      suggested that SCP may contribute to post-bypass cerebral vascular hypertension10, 11. Single&#xD;
      channel near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) measurements have been shown to correlate with&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow in animal models, but evaluation of SCP with multi-site-detector NIRS has&#xD;
      not been performed, and it is unknown if there are regional oxygenation differences12, 13.&#xD;
      This study would provide important information on the cerebral blood flow characteristics of&#xD;
      regional tissue, particularly as it relates to unilateral perfusion as well as differences in&#xD;
      patients with complex anatomy and compromised cerebral blood flow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cranial ultrasound with Doppler resistance measurements have been used to predict hypoxic&#xD;
      ischemic encephalopathy in term and preterm infants14-16. It is known that infants with&#xD;
      severe congenital heart disease have abnormal cerebral blood flow, particularly those with&#xD;
      single ventricles, and that this puts them at increased risk for periventricular&#xD;
      leukomalacia17-19. It is not clear, however, if these measurements are associated with&#xD;
      adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, and whether they can be used in combination with NIRS to&#xD;
      provide bedside information on neurologic health and adequacy of current hemodynamic&#xD;
      management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While NIRS has been demonstrated to be associated with new or worsened ischemia on&#xD;
      postoperative magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), it is often the case that these infants are&#xD;
      not stable enough for the risks inherent in obtaining an MRI, including transport and&#xD;
      sedation, and ultrasound may serve as an appropriate, safer, screening tool20, 21. We propose&#xD;
      to use an experimental continuous diagnostic modality (NIRS), combined with a known screening&#xD;
      tool (cranial ultrasound), to analyze and evaluate cerebral blood flow and oxygenation, and&#xD;
      determine if abnormal neurodevelopmental outcomes can be predicted and potentially improved&#xD;
      upon. The optimal timing of ultrasound performance is not known, and thus it is important to&#xD;
      obtain pilot data to refine a diagnostic combination to best assess the risk of neurologic&#xD;
      injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another well known risk factor for poor neurologic outcome in children with congenital heart&#xD;
      disease is genetics22. Single gene polymorphisms have been identified and associated with&#xD;
      poor neurodevelopmental outcomes and more are being identified23. Further study needs to be&#xD;
      done to better understand the genetic keys to congenital heart disease and the neurologic&#xD;
      outcomes that result because of it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, prospective analysis of cerebral perfusion in infants up to 2 months&#xD;
      of age who are undergoing repair of congenital heart disease. A total of 70 subjects will be&#xD;
      consented on this protocol with the hopes that 60 will complete the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      expected to participate in the study for a total of 6 years, from enrollment to the final&#xD;
      neurocognitive assessment. Subjects will receive $25 for the 12 month follow-up evaluation,&#xD;
      $50 for the three year evaluation, and $75 for the 6 year evaluation as patient incentive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants (up to 2 months) with congenital heart disease that undergo surgery at Children's&#xD;
      Medical Center Dallas (CMCD) will be eligible. All such patients will receive standard pre-,&#xD;
      intra-, and post-operative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will undergo a pre-operative head ultrasound to determine resistive indices&#xD;
      and Doppler flow of the middle cerebral artery. Patients will then have a&#xD;
      multi-source-detector NIRS device placed on the scalp which will be held in place with&#xD;
      Velcro. The probes are attached to wires that are connected to a data collection computer.&#xD;
      This device will collect data intra-operatively about regional tissue oxygenation and blood&#xD;
      flow and compare many different areas of the brain. A second head ultrasound will be obtained&#xD;
      in the immediate post-operative period to determine resistive indices and Doppler flow&#xD;
      (within 4 hours). Finally, a third head ultrasound will be performed within 48 hours of&#xD;
      discharge to screen for periventricular leukomalacia, or injury to the brain's white matter.&#xD;
      These examinations are not painful and produce no additional burden on the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These diagnostic tests are part of a research process and are not standard of care. Single&#xD;
      channel NIRS monitoring is standard of care and will be performed as it usually is.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurodevelopmental status will be assessed by a trained pediatric neuropsychologist at 12&#xD;
      months of age. The Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler Development will be performed at the&#xD;
      12 month evaluation (2 hours). The Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scales of Intelligence will&#xD;
      be performed at the 3 year evaluation (2 hours). The Children's Memory Scales, the Beery&#xD;
      Visual-Motor Integration Tests, the Child Behavior Checklists, and the Woodcock Johnson Tests&#xD;
      of Language Proficiency will be performed at the 6 year evaluation (3 hours). These tests are&#xD;
      not considered standard of care for these patients, but can provide important information&#xD;
      about learning disabilities and school performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, the subject will have the option to consent to providing a DNA sample. If the&#xD;
      subject does consent, one sample of blood will be collected by a doctor, nurse, or licensed&#xD;
      technician. We will take up to 30ml of blood to be collected on the day of the surgery from&#xD;
      an already existing line. These samples will be drawn in accordance with CMCD's maximum blood&#xD;
      sampling volume policies. The samples will be completely de-identified and assigned a unique&#xD;
      two digit identifier prior to being sent to the Kernie lab at UTSW for extraction and&#xD;
      analysis. This sample will be stored in a database to compare with future study subjects with&#xD;
      congenital heart disease. This blood draw will occur through an already existing line&#xD;
      (necessary for surgery) and will not add additional burden on the patient. Genetic testing&#xD;
      may include analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms, copy number variation, and simple&#xD;
      karyotyping. Correlation with type of congenital heart disease, results of neurodevelopmental&#xD;
      exams, and imaging results will be made with DNA results.&#xD;
