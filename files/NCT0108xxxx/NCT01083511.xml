      The study will be conducted with nasopharyngeal swab specimens collected prospectively from&#xD;
      individuals suspected of having an acute respiratory tract infection caused by an Influenza&#xD;
      virus. A series of standard viral culture tests validated for routine use in the clinical&#xD;
      laboratory, as well as the CDC swine H1N1 test will be used to establish a collection of well&#xD;
      characterized specimens. For each specimen four (4) aliquots will be prepared. One aliquot&#xD;
      will be tested in real-time using the requisite viral culture reference methods, one aliquot&#xD;
      will be used for H1N1 reference testing, one aliquot will be used to extract nucleic acid in&#xD;
      real-time, and one aliquot of the UTM will be archived for the purpose of sequencing to&#xD;
      confirm Influenza-positive specimens. The extracted nucleic acid and any remaining specimen&#xD;
      will be stored at -70°C for later testing by the artus Influenza RG PCR test, or other&#xD;
      investigational method(s).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year the morbidity and mortality associated with respiratory tract infections fluctuates&#xD;
      seasonally. This rise and fall is associated with the changing prevalence of respiratory&#xD;
      viruses in the population. Myriad respiratory viruses are responsible for these infections.&#xD;
      For example, Influenza Virus, Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), Parainfluenza Virus, Human&#xD;
      Metapneumovirus, Rhinovirus, and Adenovirus have all been identified as causing such&#xD;
      infections. Numerous pathogenic subtypes have been identified within most of these viral&#xD;
      groups. Apart from supportive measure (e.g., bed rest, hydration, etc.), there are no&#xD;
      effective treatments for these viral infections; however, antiviral agents (e.g.,Tamiflu) can&#xD;
      be used to alleviate the severity of flu-like symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year the virus population fluctuates, and with it the antigenic presentation of the&#xD;
      dominant strains that circulate through the population. Epidemics arise when larger and&#xD;
      larger portions of the population do not have innate or acquired resistance to such strain(s)&#xD;
      in a given season. The World Health Organization (WHO) maintains a separate website dedicated&#xD;
      to tracking outbreaks of influenza, especially avian influenza&#xD;
      (https://www.who.int/fluvirus_tracker). Influenza outbreaks monitored in the hope that a&#xD;
      pandemic similar to the Spanish Flu of 1918 can be avoided; it is estimated that well over 25&#xD;
      million people died from the Spanish Flu. The United States government also maintains a&#xD;
      separate website with resources regarding the flu and pandemic related information&#xD;
      (http://www.pandemicflu.gov/). On June 11, 2009 the WHO raised the pandemic threat level to 6&#xD;
      in response to the global appearance of a new strain of swine Influenza A (subtype H1N1). The&#xD;
      rapidity with which the H1N1 virus has spread exemplifies the notion that quickly and&#xD;
      accurately identifying a viruses associated with an outbreak is critical to global public&#xD;
      health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present study a collection of respiratory specimens that are well characterized will&#xD;
      be archived for later evaluation using the artus® Influenza RG PCR test. The artus Influenza&#xD;
      test is a real-time PCR test that identifies Influenza A, Influenza B, and Influenza Type&#xD;
      A/subtype H1N1 from nasopharyngeal swab specimens.&#xD;
