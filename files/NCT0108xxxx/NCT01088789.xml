      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and feasibility of long term boost&#xD;
      vaccination of a lethally irradiated, allogenic pancreatic tumor cell vaccine transfected&#xD;
      with the granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene alone or given in&#xD;
      combination with either a single intravenous dose or daily metronomic oral doses of&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide for the treatment of patients with surgically resected adenocarcinoma of the&#xD;
      head, neck, tail or the uncinate process of the pancreas.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. To evaluate the safety and feasibility of long term boost vaccinations of a lethally&#xD;
      irradiated, allogeneic pancreatic tumor cell vaccine transfected with the GM-CSF gene given&#xD;
      alone or in combination with either a single intravenous dose or daily metronomic oral doses&#xD;
      of cyclophosphamide for the treatment of patients with surgically resected adenocarcinoma of&#xD;
      the head, neck, or uncinate process of the pancreas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the effect of boost vaccinations and long-term treatment of immune modulating&#xD;
           doses of cyclophosphamide on the number, repertoire and avidity of peripheral&#xD;
           mesothelin-specific CD8+ T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To estimate disease-free and overall survival of surgically resected pancreatic&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma patients treated with vaccine boosts with or without low dose&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will receive by intradermal administration the pancreatic tumor vaccine&#xD;
      consisting of two irradiated, allogeneic pancreatic tumor cell lines transfected with the&#xD;
      granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) gene with or without low dose&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide. Study participants will be recruited from our prior three arm neoadjuvant&#xD;
      vaccination with or without low dose cyclophosphamide trial and vaccine naive patients. The&#xD;
      vaccination boosts will be offered as a continuation of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients from the J0810 study will remain on the same arm as the J0810 study where they have&#xD;
      received the parental vaccine. The first vaccine boost will be given no sooner than six&#xD;
      months after the last prime vaccination. The vaccine will be administered for all arms once&#xD;
      every six months after the previous vaccine until five years have passed and then once every&#xD;
      12 months until 10 years have passed, the subject no longer meets the eligibility criteria,&#xD;
      no longer wishes to participate in the study, or the vaccine supply is exhausted. Arm A&#xD;
      participants will receive the pancreatic cancer vaccine alone. Arm B participants will be&#xD;
      vaccinated and receive a single low-dose of cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m2) intravenously one&#xD;
      day prior to vaccination. Participants in Arm C will receive cyclophosphamide 50 mg once a&#xD;
      day starting from 28 days prior to day 1 of vaccination till 28 days post vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccine naive patients will first receive three prime vaccines each one month apart and each&#xD;
      in combination with a single low-dose of cyclophosphamide (200 mg/m2)intravenously one day&#xD;
      prior to vaccination. Then they will receive the boost vaccines as the participant in Arm B&#xD;
      from the J0810 study.&#xD;
