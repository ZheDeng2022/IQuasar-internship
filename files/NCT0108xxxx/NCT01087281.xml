      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Previous studies have shown that people with certain types of brain damage may have&#xD;
      particular problems paying attention and processing things that they see. Researchers are&#xD;
      interested in comparing how people with brain damage and without brain damage process visual&#xD;
      images.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand the areas of the brain involved in paying attention to things that are&#xD;
      seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals at least 18 years of age who either have had damage to one or both sides of&#xD;
      specific parts of the brain (e.g., stroke, injury, certain neurosurgery procedures) or are&#xD;
      healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The study involves 4 to 10 visits to the NIH Clinical Center over 1 to 2 years. Each&#xD;
           visit will last approximately 2 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical examination, and may&#xD;
           have the cognitive testing described below during the same visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On the first visit and for at least one visit thereafter, participants will have&#xD;
           cognitive testing to evaluate thinking and memory. These tests will be either written&#xD;
           tests or computer-based tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some participants will qualify for functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) as part&#xD;
           of the study. This part will involve a decision-making task that will be performed on a&#xD;
           computer during the fMRI scan. Additional scans may be required as directed by the study&#xD;
           doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Some randomly selected participants will be asked to have magnetoencephalography (MEG),&#xD;
           a procedure to record very small magnetic field changes produced by brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  During the behavioral training, or fMRI or MEG scanning, participants may be monitored&#xD;
           with equipment to track eye movements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Attention is required for most, if not all, perceptual processes. There is a converging body&#xD;
      of evidence from single-cell recording studies in monkeys and neuroimaging, behavioral, and&#xD;
      clinical studies in humans showing that the processing of attended information is enhanced&#xD;
      relative to the processing of unattended information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What is the source of this attentional modulation? Because neuroimaging studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that multiple cortical regions are recruited during tasks involving selective&#xD;
      attention, it has proven difficult thus far to determine the differential contributions of&#xD;
      each region. A central goal of the proposed research is to characterize the contributions of&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex and parietal cortex and test the hypothesis that these regions exert&#xD;
      top-down modulatory influences over visual processing areas. Specifically, we wish to&#xD;
      investigate the interaction between areas involved in attentional control and visual areas&#xD;
      modulated by attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to study patients with focal lesions and healthy volunteers while they perform&#xD;
      tasks requiring attention. Subjects will participate, first, in a series of behavioral&#xD;
      studies involving selective attention; the relative performance of different patient groups&#xD;
      and neurologically healthy volunteers will be compared. Subjects will also be studied while&#xD;
      performing similar tasks during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We hypothesize&#xD;
      that selective attention will be heavily impaired by lesions of key prefrontal (e.g.,&#xD;
      dorsolateral prefrontal cortex) and key parietal (e.g., superior parietal lobule) sites. We&#xD;
      also expect that brain imaging data will show decreased activation in visual regions&#xD;
      ipsilateral to the focal lesions in prefrontal and parietal cortex, thus providing evidence&#xD;
      that prefrontal and parietal cortex are sources of top-down modulation. Although other&#xD;
      research groups have compared the behavior of patients with various focal lesions or have&#xD;
      performed fMRI studies of visual attention in neurologically normal patients, we are unaware&#xD;
      of any concerted effort to perform fMRI in patients with focal lesions in order to&#xD;
      functionally isolate the contributions of individual cortical regions that serve as critical&#xD;
      nodes in the attentional network.&#xD;
