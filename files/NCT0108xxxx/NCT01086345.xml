      RATIONALE: Radiosurgery can send x-rays directly to the tumor and cause less damage to normal&#xD;
      tissue. Monoclonal antibodies, such as bevacizumab, can block tumor growth in different ways.&#xD;
      Some block the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Others find tumor cells and help&#xD;
      kill them or carry tumor-killing substances to them. Bevacizumab may also stop the growth of&#xD;
      glioblastoma by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy such as&#xD;
      irinotecan hydrochloride work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving radiosurgery together with&#xD;
      bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well giving radiosurgery together with&#xD;
      bevacizumab and irinotecan hydrochloride works in treating patients with recurrent&#xD;
      glioblastoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall survival of patients with recurrent GBM treated with bevacizumab,&#xD;
      irinotecan and radiosurgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the toxicities of the combination of bevacizumab, irinotecan and radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival of patients treated with bevacizumab,&#xD;
      irinotecan and radiosurgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive bevacizumab IV over 30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Patients also receive&#xD;
      irinotecan hydrochloride IV on days 1 and 15 beginning in course 2. Courses repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo radiosurgery 10-14 days after beginning bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for 18 months.&#xD;
