  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dengue viruses can cause dengue fever and other serious health conditions, primarily&#xD;
      affecting people living in tropical regions of the world. There are four types of dengue&#xD;
      virus, and infection with one does not offer protection against the others. This study will&#xD;
      test whether a vaccine developed to prevent infection with dengue virus type 1 (DEN1) causes&#xD;
      a response in people's immune system and is safe.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dengue virus causes approximately 50 million cases of dengue fever and 1.5 million cases&#xD;
      of the more severe diseases dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHS) and dengue shock syndrome (DSS)&#xD;
      every year. There are four subtypes of the virus, and infection with one offers no protection&#xD;
      from infection by the others. In fact, most cases of DHS and DSS occur in people infected by&#xD;
      more than one subtype. In areas of the world where multiple subtypes of dengue are common,&#xD;
      vaccines must be developed against each of the subtypes of dengue virus. This study will&#xD;
      examine the safety and immune response of an investigational vaccine for preventing infection&#xD;
      with DEN1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study will last about 6 weeks. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to be injected with either the investigational study vaccine or a placebo. Participants will&#xD;
      have a five in six chance of receiving the vaccine. The first study visit will take place on&#xD;
      the vaccination day, on which participants will undergo a physical examination, blood draw,&#xD;
      and pregnancy test, and then receive the vaccine. Participants will be given a thermometer&#xD;
      and temperature card, and be told to record their temperature three times per day for 16 days&#xD;
      after vaccination. Participants will come to follow-up visits every other day for the 16 days&#xD;
      after vaccination, and then 3, 4, and 6 weeks after vaccination (Days 21, 28, and 42).&#xD;
      Assessments completed during these visits will include a questionnaire about how the&#xD;
      participant is feeling, pregnancy test, review of temperature cards, blood draw, and physical&#xD;
      exam. Blood drawn will be analyzed to check participants' health, determine the amount of&#xD;
      vaccine and antibodies in the blood, test markers in white blood cells and genes, and look&#xD;
      for proteins that are important for fighting dengue infection.&#xD;
