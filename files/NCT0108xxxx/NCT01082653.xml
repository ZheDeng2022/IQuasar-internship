    <textblock>
      A Phase I, single center, prospective, non-randomized, open label, safety/efficacy study of&#xD;
      the infusion of autologous bone marrow-derived stem cells, in 6 patients with Amyotrophic&#xD;
      Lateral Sclerosis according to established criteria (1), (2) with a moderate to severe&#xD;
      diagnosis of ALS according to the World Federation of Neurology El Escorial criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this study is to evaluate safety of the infusion procedure, as&#xD;
      assessed by absence of complications at the site of infusion or the appearance of new&#xD;
      neurologic deficit not attributed to the natural progression of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include a)neurological evidence of trends toward a slowing down of&#xD;
      the decline of the forced vital capacity (FVC) (3) and of the functional rating scale&#xD;
      (ALS-FRS) scores, as assessed at 3-month intervals, b)evidence of a decline of the maximum&#xD;
      voluntary isometric contraction-arm (MVIC-arm) and MVIC-grip Z (4) scores and c)patient&#xD;
      evaluation that the treatment was effective and consider the possibility of a new cell&#xD;
      product stem cell infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who fulfill inclusion/exclusion criteria and sign informed consent will undergo an&#xD;
      aspiration of bone marrow from the iliac crest for preparation of the cellular product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The day of infusion, the investigational product will be injected into the patient's&#xD;
      intrathecal space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cell infusion patients will be followed at WK 2, MN 1, MN 2, MN 6 and a long-term&#xD;
      followup at MN 12 in the clinic and/or office. Electromyographic (EMG) studies, Forced vital&#xD;
      capacity (FVC), functional rating scale (FRS) and maximum voluntary isometric contraction-arm&#xD;
      (MVIC-arm) and MVIC-grip Z scores will have been used to assess the status of the disease&#xD;
      before (historical record acceptable if done within three months of Screening Visit) and&#xD;
      during the 12-month study period after cell infusion.&#xD;
