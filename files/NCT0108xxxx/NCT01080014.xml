      This observational study is being conducted to evaluate the usefulness of the MSFC and its&#xD;
      relationship with EDSS scores in subjects with MS in Argentina.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This observational, open-label study is being conducted to correlate change in EDSS score&#xD;
      with the change in MSFC scores at the end of a 2-year follow-up period for subjects with MS&#xD;
      in Argentina. Measurement of disability is an indispensable parameter in assessing the&#xD;
      efficacy of experimental therapeutic agents in MS as well as in trying to determine possible&#xD;
      individual evolution of the disease. Clinical scales are being used as primary or secondary&#xD;
      outcome measures for recording disease progression in clinical trials. Kurtzke's EDSS is&#xD;
      still used as a gold standard for measuring impairment and disability in MS. The MSFC is an&#xD;
      examination-based quantitative scoring of neurological impairment. This study aims to&#xD;
      establish a correlation between the usefulness of both scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the change in MSFC score with change in EDSS scores at end of 2 year&#xD;
           follow-up period for subjects with MS in Argentina&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the cross-sectional correlations in MSFC score at baseline and at 24 months&#xD;
           with EDSS score at baseline and at 24 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the MSFC score for MS phenotype in this population&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the predictive validity of MSFC score of a subsequent EDSS change in a&#xD;
           subgroup of MS patients in Argentina&#xD;
