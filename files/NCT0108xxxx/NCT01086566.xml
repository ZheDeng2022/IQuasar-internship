      The purpose of the study is to evaluate safety and compare how the body reacts to 2 different&#xD;
      strengths of the Clade (specific type of H5N1 virus) 2 H5N1 flu vaccine when given as a&#xD;
      single vaccination with a high dose (90 mcg) or low dose (15 mcg) to volunteers who have&#xD;
      received at least 2 doses of the Clade 1 H5N1 vaccine, in a previous National Institute of&#xD;
      Health study or who have never received a H5N1 vaccine (naïve). Previously vaccinated&#xD;
      subjects (in studies 04-0063, 05-0090, 05-0127) will receive either 15 or 90 mcg of H5N1&#xD;
      vaccine. Multiply boosted volunteers who participated study 05-0043 and received Clade 1 and&#xD;
      3 vaccines, will receive the same dose (15mcg). Vaccine naïve subjects will receive 2 doses&#xD;
      of vaccine (15 or 90 mcg) separated by 28 days. Blood samples will be collected. 115&#xD;
      volunteers age 18-64 may participate in study related procedures for approximately 7 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In response to the steadily increasing number of reports of human infection with avian&#xD;
      influenza A (H5N1) viruses, there is now a world-wide effort to develop and test potential&#xD;
      candidate vaccines for this and other avian viruses with pandemic potential. The study will&#xD;
      be conducted as a laboratory blinded assessment of the humoral and cellular immune response&#xD;
      to A/Indonesia/5/05 vaccine in three populations: healthy adults who have previously received&#xD;
      a clade 1 H5 vaccine in a Division of Microbiology and Infectious Diseases (DMID)-sponsored&#xD;
      study; healthy adult recipients of prime-boost regimens representing two clades; and healthy&#xD;
      adults with no previous H5 vaccination and who are not at risk for H5 exposures. Primed&#xD;
      subjects are randomized to receive a single dose of either 15 mcg or 90 mcg of&#xD;
      A/Indonesia/5/05 vaccine. Multiply boosted subjects are those who participated in study&#xD;
      05-0043, and have previously received both A/HK/97 (Clade 3) and A/VN/04 (Clade 1) vaccines.&#xD;
      Because only a small number of such subjects are available, they will not be randomized but&#xD;
      will all receive the same dose of vaccine. Unprimed subjects are randomized to receive 2&#xD;
      doses of 15 mcg or 90 mcg of A/Indonesia/5/05 vaccine separated by 28 days. In all groups,&#xD;
      sera and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) are obtained prior to and on days 3, 7,&#xD;
      14, and 28 after each dose. Primed and multiply boosted subjects also have sera and PBMC&#xD;
      obtained on day 56. All groups will make a final study visit at 6 months following the last&#xD;
      dose of vaccine (day 180 for primed and boosted subjects and day 208 for unprimed subjects).&#xD;
      Approximately 115 subjects between the ages of 18 and 64 will participate in this study. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to determine the safety of administration of the A/Indonesia/05&#xD;
      subvirion vaccine when administered to healthy, primed or unprimed adults. The secondary&#xD;
      objective is to: determine the effects of priming with a clade 1 vaccine on antibody&#xD;
      responses to revaccination with a clade 2 vaccine. The tertiary objectives are to determine&#xD;
      the effects of priming on the repertoire and phenotypes of B and T cells generated in&#xD;
      response to vaccination; to evaluate whether pre-existing immunity to seasonal influenza&#xD;
      viruses impacts the specificity and magnitude of the cluster of differentiation marker (CD)4&#xD;
      T cell response to H5 vaccination and to describe the kinetics of the cellualr immune&#xD;
      response to subvirion H5N1 vaccinatin in primed and unprimed individuals. The primary&#xD;
      endpoint is reactogenicity, adverse event (AE) and serious adverse event (SAE) information,&#xD;
      solicited in-clinic and via memory aids. The secondary endpoints are: levels of HAI antibody&#xD;
      recognizing A/Indonesia/05 (Clade 2), A/Vietnam/04 (Clade 1) and representative Clade 2&#xD;
      subclade viruses, and levels of neutralizing antibody assessed by neutralization tests using&#xD;
      the rgA/Indonesia/5/05 virus prior to and Days 3, 7, 14, and 28 after each vaccination. This&#xD;
      study is linked to DMID protocols 04-063, 05-0090, 05-0043 and 05-0127.&#xD;
