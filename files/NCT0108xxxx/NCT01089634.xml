      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To characterize left ventricular (LV) threshold behavior over time using daily left&#xD;
      ventricular capture management (LVCM) measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study with patients receiving their&#xD;
      first cardiac resynchronisation therapy-implantable cardioverter defibrillator (CRT-ICD)&#xD;
      device. The study design, based on the primary objective, is an observational examination of&#xD;
      LV thresholds over time. Daily left ventricular threshold measurements will be collected&#xD;
      using the LVCM feature. Up to 150 patients will be enrolled in Canada to evaluate the primary&#xD;
      objective at up to 15 study centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected at Baseline, Implant, 12 months post-implant and all regularly&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up visits up to 12 months post-implant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ConcertoTM CRT-ICD device and future Medtronic CRT-ICD devices containing the LVCM&#xD;
      feature will be used in this study.&#xD;

      I. Study Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the LEARN Study is to provide information that will assist clinicians in&#xD;
      managing LV thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Device Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CRT-ICD devices to be used in this study are all Therapeutic Products Directorate&#xD;
      licensed, market released Medtronic CRT-ICD devices equipped with the LVCM feature. Currently&#xD;
      this includes only the ConcertoTM CRT Defibrillator. Future Medtronic models equipped with&#xD;
      the LVCM feature that become Therapeutic Products Directorate licensed and market released in&#xD;
      the future are also included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will allow all commercially available leads from all manufacturers that are&#xD;
      compatible with Medtronic CRT-ICD devices. Devices will be programmed and interrogated with a&#xD;
      Medtronic 9790 or 2090 programmer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medtronic defibrillators automatically detect and treat episodes of ventricular fibrillation&#xD;
      (VF), ventricular tachycardia (VT) and bradyarrhythmia. When a ventricular arrhythmia is&#xD;
      detected, the implantable devices deliver defibrillation, cardioversion, anti-tachycardia&#xD;
      pacing or standard pacing therapy to terminate the ventricular arrhythmia. In addition,&#xD;
      Medtronic CRT defibrillators, including Concerto, also provide Cardiac Resynchronization&#xD;
      therapy. All devices in this study will be used according to their intended use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Study Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Study Objective: To characterize LV threshold behavior over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Study Scope:&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 patients will be enrolled in Canada to evaluate the primary objective at up to 15 study&#xD;
      centers. Individual centers will be limited to a maximum of 30 enrollments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for a 12 month period with interim visits occurring according to&#xD;
      regular clinic follow up schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Study Design This is a multicenter, prospective, non-interventional study with patients&#xD;
      receiving their first CRT-ICD device. The study design, based on the primary objective, is an&#xD;
      observational examination of LV thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed in clinic as per the hospital ICD clinic standard follow up&#xD;
      schedule with a mandatory follow-up visit at 12 months (± 30 days) post-implant. The&#xD;
      following will be collected at the 12 month (± 30 days) visit and at all regularly scheduled&#xD;
      follow-up visits: LV threshold measurements, changes in cardiovascular medications and a save&#xD;
      to disk file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Patient Population Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who will be implanted with their first CRT defibrillator system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who will be implanted with a Medtronic CRT defibrillator containing the LVCM&#xD;
           feature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are willing and able to sign an IRB/MEC approved patient informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who are geographically stable and available for follow-up at the study center&#xD;
           for the required follow-up duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who meet any of the following criteria are excluded from entry into the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have a pre-existing LV lead prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who have a life expectancy of less than 1 year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients included in another clinical trial that will affect the objectives of this&#xD;
           study&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Overview of Data Collection Requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected at baseline, implant, regularly scheduled follow-up visits&#xD;
      over 12months, system modifications, and patient withdrawal/exit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected via case report forms, and Save-to-Disk files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B. Enrollment Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no medications or treatments that are required in this study. Patients enrolled in&#xD;
      the LEARN Study will receive the standard of medical care that is typically provided by the&#xD;
      investigator. There are no medications or treatments that are not permitted in this study,&#xD;
      unless they conflict with the patient inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients planned to be implanted with a CRT-ICD will be evaluated for inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Patients who meet these inclusion and exclusion criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Each study subject must sign an IRB/MEC approved consent form prior&#xD;
      to implant. Once the patient signs the consent form the patient is enrolled in the LEARN&#xD;
      Study. Patients must be consented and enrolled prior to hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of enrollment, a Baseline Case Report Form must be completed. The following&#xD;
      information will be documented on this form:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Verification that all inclusion/exclusion criteria were met&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular status and history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arrhythmia status and history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current Cardiovascular and Medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      C. Implant Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medtronic device will be implanted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The&#xD;
      leads will be implanted according to the instructions provided with the applicable lead. Only&#xD;
      commercially available RA, RV and LV leads may be used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At implant, record the model number and serial number of the device and leads implanted on&#xD;
      the implant form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a patient does not receive a ConcertoTM or equivalent LVCM equipped&#xD;
      Medtronic CRT-ICD device, they will be withdrawn from the study via a study exit case report&#xD;
      form. In the event that an LV lead cannot be placed at the time of implant and subsequent&#xD;
      attempts to implant an LV lead are either not successful or not attempted, the patient will&#xD;
      be withdrawn from the study via a study exit case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D. LVCM Programming Requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to collect data on LV thresholds, the LVCM feature must be set to either Monitor or&#xD;
      Adaptive. The setting must be noted on the implant form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      E. Follow-up Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be performed at all regularly scheduled in-clinic follow-up visits for 12&#xD;
      months post-implant including the required 12 month visit. Record the required data on the&#xD;
      corresponding CRF for each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Record LV lead data on the follow up CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Record results of manual LV threshold testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      b) 'Interrogate all' and perform a final Save-to-Disk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F. Adverse Event Reporting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will not be collected in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      G. System Modification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that the CRT defibrillator or lead system requires invasive modification (e.g.,&#xD;
      device or LV lead explant, device or LV lead replacement, attempting to place LV lead after&#xD;
      initial failed attempt, or lead repositioning), the System Modification Case Report Form must&#xD;
      be completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient's CRT defibrillator system or LV lead is explanted and not replaced, complete&#xD;
      a study exit form and exit the patient from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H. Study Exit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event that a patient is unable or unwilling to continue participation in the study,&#xD;
      notify the Medtronic Clinical Research Manager immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are enrolled in the study, but do not receive a Concerto or equivalent Medtronic&#xD;
      device, as well as patients who do not receive an LV lead must be withdrawn via a Study Exit&#xD;
      Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient expresses desire to withdraw from the study, a Study Exit Case Report Form must&#xD;
      be completed. The reason for patient withdrawal must be documented on this form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case that the patient fails to comply with the follow-up schedule, the study site must&#xD;
      attempt to contact the patient. Each attempt to contact the patient must be documented in the&#xD;
      patient's records. In the event that the patient is lost to follow-up, a Study Exit Case&#xD;
      Report Form must be completed. Details on all attempts to contact the patient and the method&#xD;
      used (e.g. telephone, registered mail) must be recorded on the case report form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of a patient death, a study exit form should be completed with patient death&#xD;
      listed as the reason for withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Study Deviations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Study Deviation is defined as an event where the clinical Investigator or site personnel&#xD;
      did not conduct the study according to the Investigational Plan, protocol, applicable laws or&#xD;
      regulations or the Investigator Agreement. Examples include but are not limited to: failure&#xD;
      to obtain informed consent, missing save to disk etc. It is the responsibility of the&#xD;
      investigator to notify the study sponsor (Medtronic of Canada Ltd.) of any deviation and&#xD;
      complete the Deviation CRF including rationale for the deviation. Any planned deviation that&#xD;
      may affect the rights, safety or welfare of a patient involved in this study requires prior&#xD;
      approval of the IRB/MEC and Medtronic. If a patient is enrolled in violation of the inclusion&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria, the patient will not contribute to the study objectives. All protocol&#xD;
      deviations should be reported by the investigator to Medtronic on a deviation CRF and to the&#xD;
      sites IRB/MEC as per IRB/MEC policy.&#xD;
