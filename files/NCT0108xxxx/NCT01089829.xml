  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Foot ulceration is a risk factor that has been associated with early death in patients with&#xD;
      chronic kidney disease. Little is known about the relationship between these risk factors&#xD;
      that develop in patients with kidney failure and the onset of lower limb threatening foot&#xD;
      ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a major cause of both kidney disease and foot ulceration; however a previous&#xD;
      study reported that a significant proportion of kidney failure patients on haemodialysis&#xD;
      treatment without a diagnosis of diabetes also had these risk factors that could lead to foot&#xD;
      ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to identify these risk factors associated with lower limb&#xD;
      threatening disease in patients with advanced kidney failure. In addition a robust screening&#xD;
      tool will be developed to address the reliability and validity of current screening methods&#xD;
      deemed to be gold standard in the assessment of diabetic foot disease in this Chronic Kidney&#xD;
      Disease population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to follow the progression of these risk factors as the kidney failure&#xD;
      worsens. The study also intends to screen patients as they start dialysis treatment and&#xD;
      follow their progress with respect to risk factors known to predispose to foot ulceration&#xD;
      over their first year of treatment. The proposed outcome from this study is to develop a&#xD;
      strategy to identify patients with kidney failure that are at risk of foot ulceration and&#xD;
      intervene at an early point to prevent the life threatening complications associated foot&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The risk factors contributing to foot ulceration in the diabetic population are well&#xD;
      published, and an abundance of these publications demonstrate the acceleration of risk&#xD;
      factors in association with diabetic nephropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is also apparent that there are risk factors present in the non-diabetic Chronic Kidney&#xD;
      Disease population but much less information about there prevalence and progression is&#xD;
      published. A recent pilot study reported significant risk factors for foot ulceration in a&#xD;
      population of subjects receiving haemodialysis therapy in the absence of diabetes mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to increase the understanding of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) and the&#xD;
      development of foot ulceration in the diabetic and non-diabetic Chronic Kidney Disease&#xD;
      population as renal failure progresses and dialysis is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Identification:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed to identify patients with Chronic Kidney Disease level 4 (renal function at&#xD;
      between 15 and 30% of normal)in the Nephrology clinics at University Hospital of Wales,&#xD;
      Cardiff. It is this group of patients that are most at risk of progression of renal disease&#xD;
      towards end stage and subsequent need for dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A proportion of the patients will be identified from the pre-dialysis clinics that are due to&#xD;
      commence dialysis imminently. It is this group of patients that will used to examine the&#xD;
      specific effects of dialysis modality on risk factors for foot ulceration The directorate of&#xD;
      Nephrology and Transplantation in Cardiff has 450 haemodialysis patients, 140 peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis (CAPD) patients, and around 400 Chronic Kidney Disease level 4 patients.&#xD;
      Approximately 100 new patients commence dialysis each year of which 35 will start peritoneal&#xD;
      dialysis and the rest haemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal patients currently have the freedom to choose their preferred modality of dialysis&#xD;
      following a series of informed consultations with the Physician. One method may be indicated&#xD;
      over another if the patient does not meet the suitability criteria for one or other of the&#xD;
      modalities. However, current recruitment trends demonstrate that most patients prefer to&#xD;
      choose haemodialysis despite the socioeconomic challenges the therapy poses on their quality&#xD;
      of life and the cost constraints on the health service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study demonstrated that 20% of patients with diabetes develop foot ulceration&#xD;
      within the first year of commencing haemodialysis and this may be attributed to the hypoxia&#xD;
      of the peripheral tissues during the haemodialysis process. There is much less information&#xD;
      about the changes seen with the initiation of peritoneal dialysis and this study may help to&#xD;
      influence dialysis modality choice in the future if one method of dialysis is associated with&#xD;
      the development of fewer lower limb threatening complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Stage 4/5 Chronic Kidney Disease (eGFR &lt;30ml/min) Over 18 years of age&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Chronic Kidney Disease Stage 1-3 (eGFR &gt;31) Inability or refusal to give&#xD;
      informed consent Life expectancy &lt; 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Proton database held within Nephrology along with clinic lists will be used to identify&#xD;
      potential patients by the research team and an invitation letter will be sent with a study&#xD;
      information leaflet prior to their clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Physician in the clinic will recruit the patient to take part in the study during the&#xD;
      Outpatient consultation. Clinic lists will also be reviewed to identify patients with Chronic&#xD;
      Kidney Disease stage 4/5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The longitudinal prospective study proposed would expand on pilot study results to include&#xD;
      level 4 Chronic Kidney Disease and monitor the development of lower limb threatening risk&#xD;
      factors with the progression of kidney failure towards end stage renal disease.Patients will&#xD;
      be followed for a 2 year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single Podiatrist will undertake the interview and use non-invasive techniques to assess&#xD;
      feet for physiological risk factors in accordance with evidence-based practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Renal Foot Screening Tool has been developed and will be used to prospectively identify&#xD;
      the neurovascular risk factors for foot ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients would have podiatry assessment at baseline, 12 and 24 months. In addition a&#xD;
      triggered assessment would take place at commencement of dialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations are difficult to undertake given the lack of current knowledge of risk&#xD;
      factors for this group of patients. Following consultation with a statistician on the&#xD;
      supervisory team the minimum figure of 100 has been adopted as the target for Chronic Kidney&#xD;
      Disease level 4 patients with an additional minimum 100 patients commencing renal replacement&#xD;
      therapy over the course of the study period.The target for recruitment was estimated taking&#xD;
      into account the financial and resource implications, and was agreed by the supervisory team&#xD;
      to be a realistic sample size. Subsequent statistical analysis will include multiple&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic and medical information will be obtained through patient interview and medical&#xD;
      records at the time of the foot screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be questioned about prior foot care education, patient perception of their&#xD;
      current foot health status, history of Podiatry care, history of foot ulceration and previous&#xD;
      amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive assessment techniques&#xD;
&#xD;
      No current foot screening provision for patients with Chronic Kidney Disease exists in&#xD;
      Cardiff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research participants will have a detailed foot screening consultation that will identify&#xD;
      potential risks of foot ulceration allowing earlier intervention should it be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients enrolled into this study will have enhanced care in terms of identification of&#xD;
      potential foot ulceration. However, this does raise some ethical concerns. The first is that&#xD;
      patients may be seen at presentation with a foot ulcer or be at high risk of developing a&#xD;
      foot ulcer and these patients will be referred to the Podiatry service for routine treatment.&#xD;
      The other issue is that patients will not be given verbal education regarding their specific&#xD;
      foot care needs during the contacts. We justify this in that we are trying to find the&#xD;
      factors associated with Chronic Kidney Disease that contribute to foot ulceration in a&#xD;
      longitudinal fashion. Intervention with education could confound the true prevalence for the&#xD;
      study. We would acknowledge that simply checking the feet of a patient would alter their&#xD;
      awareness and this also may influence the study findings in a small way. Information leaflet&#xD;
      provided to each high risk participant will give indications of the danger signs that can&#xD;
      preceded to ulceration and infection,with a help line telephone number to call should a&#xD;
      participant develop any of these warning signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant will be fast track referred to the Cardiff &amp; Vale Podiatry department, and&#xD;
      given an urgent appointment at a Cardiff &amp; Vale Podiatry Wound Clinic for a treatment plan.&#xD;
      Follow up care will be provided by the local Community Podiatry Service after the wound has&#xD;
      healed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-healing foot ulcers will be referred to the Multi-disciplinary Foot Ulcer Clinic for&#xD;
      review by the Vascular, Orthopaedic, and Medical team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral neuropathy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure all patients with neuropathy are identified multiple forms of assessment will be&#xD;
      used for each patient. All methods of assessment are standardised, and any tests will be&#xD;
      demonstrated on the back of one hand for the patient to experience prior to formal neuropathy&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previously published Neuropathy Symptom Score is used to pick up symptomatic peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy. This scoring system is used to identify the sensory symptoms of peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy, such as aching, burning, prickling, numbness, and sharp pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light pressure sensation is tested using the Semmes-Weinstein 10g monofilament at 10 sites on&#xD;
      each foot. The patient is instructed to close their eyes, the 10g monofilament is applied at&#xD;
      a 90 degree right angle to the selected site until it buckled, and held for 1 second before&#xD;
      moving onto the next test site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A positive neuropathy score for the monofilament assessment is defined as inability to&#xD;
      perceive the monofilament sensation on the testing sites on each foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A neurothesiometer is used to test vibration perception threshold. This device is applied&#xD;
      with the tractor balanced vertically onto the pulp of the hallux with the voltage increased&#xD;
      at the base unit until the patient can perceive the vibration sensation. A mean of three&#xD;
      readings would be recorded for each foot.A value of 25 volts and over would confirm the&#xD;
      patient being 'At Risk' of foot ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that patients often score differently for each test, patients with a positive score&#xD;
      during any of the 3 repetitions are classified as having peripheral neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular Insufficiency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Edinburgh Claudication Questionnaire is used to diagnose symptomatic vascular&#xD;
      insufficiency. Patients score positive for symptomatic vascular insufficiency if they&#xD;
      described either symptoms of intermittent claudication or rest pain. The possibility of&#xD;
      concomitant peripheral neuropathy in this patient population is such that symptoms alone are&#xD;
      insufficient to diagnose peripheral vascular disease. Therefore a hand held Doppler&#xD;
      ultrasound is used to locate the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial arteries. The probe is&#xD;
      lightly applied to the skin to avoid occlusion of the artery, and the audible sound is&#xD;
      reproduced on a printout in preparation for waveform analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arterial insufficiency is recorded when both the dorsalis pedis and posterior tibial signals&#xD;
      are monophasic in a single lower limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Foot Pathology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is recognised that foot pathology is an additional risk factor for foot ulceration&#xD;
      especially in those patients with either peripheral neuropathy or vascular insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both feet are visually inspected for common pathologies predisposing to diabetic foot&#xD;
      ulceration. Any deformity, including hammer toes and Charcot deformity, nail dystrophies,&#xD;
      corns and calluses are reported as additional risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of active foot ulceration is documented and graded according to the Texas Wound&#xD;
      Classification system to ascertain the severity of the wounds presenting within a cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected on laptop will only have study identification number recorded to ensure the&#xD;
      anonymisation of participants during data collection and data analysis by the research team&#xD;
      statistician. The laptop will be password secure and be stored in a locked filling cabinet in&#xD;
      a locked office with key access to the Band 7 Podiatrist. Files containing consent forms will&#xD;
      be indexed in numerical order of study identification numbers, and will be stored in a locked&#xD;
      filling cabinet with only access to the Principle Investigator and the Band 7 Podiatrist. The&#xD;
      file will be the only source of person identifiable information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of a none invasive assessment of body composition will allow a review of body fluid&#xD;
      status which may impact on the ability of tissues to heal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resources:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Podiatrist will be required to undertake this longitudinal study on a part time basis. This&#xD;
      is supported by the fact that the highly specialised skills developed by the Podiatrist need&#xD;
      to be maintained during the PhD study period also require a contribution of specialist&#xD;
      clinical duties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The equipment needed to make the measurements is available from the department of Podiatry&#xD;
      and is calibrated and used on a day to day basis for current patient care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Willing participants will be offered foot screening at the end of the Nephrology OPD&#xD;
      consultation to minimise any further inconvenience with travelling and parking costs A&#xD;
      contribution may be required for patients travelling expenses when they are recalled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full support of the Institute of Nephrology has been obtained in terms of supervision by&#xD;
      a Consultant Nephrologist and access to patient information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed that this work will be presented at Podiatry and Renal conferences in the UK&#xD;
      and overseas. Minimum of 3 papers and 3 conference presentations. There is room for&#xD;
      publication in Podiatry and Renal publications to ensure both groups of professionals are&#xD;
      informed. Posters will be prepared for international conferences. There is also an&#xD;
      opportunity to consider Nursing conferences to raise general awareness of the issue, and any&#xD;
      opportunities that arise for the preparation of review articles will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and impact:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of the study is to identify the neurovascular risk factors for foot&#xD;
      ulceration as renal function declines, and to develop a suitable foot protection programme&#xD;
      for Chronic Kidney Disease patients. The secondary outcome measure is to identify whether&#xD;
      dialysis modality choice influence foot ulcer development and should this be used to inform&#xD;
      patient choice of dialysis.&#xD;
