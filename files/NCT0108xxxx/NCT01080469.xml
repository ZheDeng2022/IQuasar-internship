      The objective of the study is to demonstrate bioequivalence between Test Product (A):&#xD;
      Tacrolimus Capsules 1 mg, manufactured by Panacea Biotec Limited, India and the corresponding&#xD;
      Reference Product (B): Prograf (Tacrolimus) Capsules 1 mg, manufactured by Astellas Pharma,&#xD;
      Inc., USA in 36 normal, healthy, adult, male subjects under fed condition.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Total 36 normal healthy adult male subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will be&#xD;
      administered either the Test or the Reference Product with 240 mL of water in each period as&#xD;
      per the randomization schedule. Subjects will fast for at least 10 hours prior to High Fat&#xD;
      Breakfast half an hour before administration of the study drug and for four (4) additional&#xD;
      hours each, post dose during each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each&#xD;
      study period. Water will not be accessible to the subjects 1 hour Predose and 2 hours Post&#xD;
      dose in each period. A total of 26 blood samples will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profiling. The whole blood concentrations of Tacrolimus will be measured by a validated&#xD;
      LC/MS/MS analytical method. Ratio analysis will be performed for untransformed and log&#xD;
      transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-72, AUC0 inf. ANOVA will be performed on&#xD;
      log transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-72, AUC0-inf and 90% confidence&#xD;
      interval will be constructed for the ratio of geometric least square mean of the Test and&#xD;
      Reference products, obtained from the log-transformed data. Bioequivalence will be concluded&#xD;
      if the ratio estimate as well as its 90% confidence interval, both falls within the&#xD;
      acceptable range of 80.00% to 125.00% for Cmax, AUC0-72 and AUC0-inf.&#xD;
