  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Systemic sclerosis-associated pulmonary arterial hypertension (SSc-PAH) is a serious,&#xD;
      life-threatening manifestation of systemic sclerosis (SSc), an autoimmune disease of the&#xD;
      connective tissue characterized by scarring (fibrosis) and atrophy of the skin, joints and&#xD;
      tendons, skeletal muscles, and internal organs, and immunological disturbances. One-year&#xD;
      survival for patients with SSc-PAH ranges from 50-81%. There is currently no cure for SSc-PAH&#xD;
      and treatment is limited to vasodilator therapy used in all forms of PAH. In recent studies,&#xD;
      immunotherapy was shown to be effective in treating SSc-interstitial lung disease, another&#xD;
      serious, life-threatening manifestation of SSc. In addition, there are compelling&#xD;
      pre-clinical data and anecdotal clinical reports that suggest modulation of the immune system&#xD;
      may be an effective strategy for treating SSc-PAH. To test this approach, this trial will&#xD;
      determine if rituximab, an immunotherapy, has a marked beneficial effect on clinical disease&#xD;
      progression, with minimal toxicity, in patients with SSc-PAH when compared to placebo.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multi-center, randomized trial will&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of rituximab on disease progression in subjects with SSc-PAH receiving&#xD;
      concurrent stable-dose standard medical therapy with a prostanoid, endothelin receptor&#xD;
      antagonist, and/or phosphodiesterase 5 (PDE-5) inhibitor. The study will focus on assessment&#xD;
      of clinical response and safety measures longitudinally. In addition, the effects of&#xD;
      treatment with rituximab on the underlying immune mechanisms associated with B-cell&#xD;
      dysregulation and pathogenic autoantibody response in this disease will be investigated. 1000&#xD;
      mg of rituximab or placebo will be administered as two IV infusions given two weeks apart.&#xD;
      Clinical assessments and sample collection will occur at monthly visits through Week 48. If a&#xD;
      participant has not recovered B cells by Week 48, B cell studies will be conducted quarterly&#xD;
      until reconstitution is documented or for 2 years after initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will include a sub-study, entitled &quot;Right Ventricular Response to Rituximab in&#xD;
      Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension - A Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      Sub-study&quot; (RESTORE Sub-study). The objective of the RESTORE sub-study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      therapeutic effect of rituximab on the right ventricle of patients with SSc-PAH. Changes in&#xD;
      right ventricular end diastolic volume index (RVEDVI) and stroke volume (SV) determined by&#xD;
      cardiac MRI will be used as surrogates of right ventricle function and prognosis. Enrollment&#xD;
      for the RESTORE sub-study will parallel that of main trial. Twenty patients from each&#xD;
      treatment arm, distributed among all participating sites, will be recruited for this&#xD;
      sub-study. Each patient will be studied at baseline (i.e. prior to initiation of study drug)&#xD;
      and after 24 weeks or at time of discontinuation. In addition to the data collection and&#xD;
      testing specified in the main trial, participants in RESTORE will undergo comprehensive&#xD;
      cardiac MRI evaluation. All main trial study inclusion and exclusion criteria apply, as well&#xD;
      as additional exclusion criteria that pertain only to the RESTORE sub-study: 1) known&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to Gadolinium; 2) inability to tolerate or cooperate with MRI; 3) morbid&#xD;
      obesity; and 4) presence of metallic objects or pacemakers.&#xD;

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Distance Walked During a Six Minute Walk Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Treatment Initiation) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The six minute walk test measures the distance a participant is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the participant to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The participant is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway. The total distance walked, in meters, was recorded for each participant. Longer distances indicate better outcomes.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Pulmonary Vascular Resistance Measured by Right Heart Catheterization at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Treatment Initiation) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>During a right heart catheterization, a catheter is guided to the right side of the heart and then into the pulmonary artery; blood flow through the heart is observed and is used to measure pressures in a participant's heart and lungs. The calculation of Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) is measured in Woods Units. Change is derived by measuring the difference between Baseline and Week 24 PVR (Week 24 minus Baseline). Higher PVR values indicate worse disease status.</description>

    <description>Assessment of time to clinical worsening, censored at Week 48, defined as the first occurrence of any of the following:&#xD;
death,&#xD;
hospitalization for Systemic Sclerosis-Associated Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (SSc-PAH),&#xD;
lung transplantation,&#xD;
atrial septostomy,&#xD;
addition of other Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) therapeutic agents, or&#xD;
worsening of the six minute walk distance by &gt; 20% and an increase in New York Heart Association functional class.&#xD;
Time to clinical worsening was defined as the first date that met any of the above criteria and was calculated in study days as: date of first event minus (-) date of treatment randomization. If a participant did not experience any of the referenced events by Week 48 or, if the date of death was after the 48 week follow-up period, time to clinical worsening was equal to the participant's duration of follow-up in the study.</description>

    <measure>Time to the Change or Addition of New Pulmonary Arterial Hypertension (PAH) Therapeutic Medications</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Treatment Initiation) to Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Per protocol, from the time of study entry, participants were to remain on background PAH medical therapy with either a single agent or a combination of prostanoid, endothelin receptor antagonist, PDE-5 inhibitor, and/or guanylate cyclase stimulators as per the entry criteria. Doses should have remained stable through the Week 24 primary outcome/endpoint visit. If a dose of a background PAH medication was changed or a new PAH medication was added during the course of the trial, the date of the first dose change or additional medication was recorded. Time to the addition or modification of PAH medications was defined in study days as: date of the first time a PAH medication was modified or added minus (-) date of randomization.</description>

    <measure>Change in Severity of Raynaud's Phenomenon</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Pre Treatment Initiation) to Week 24 and Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Severity of Raynaud's phenomenon was measured by a Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of the Scleroderma Health Assessment Questionnaire (SHAQ). The SHAQ VAS includes a question asking, &quot;In the past week, how much has your Raynaud's Phenomenon interfered with your activities?&quot; Participants were asked to place a mark on a 15 cm line, scaled from 0 (does not interfere) to 100 (very severe limitation), to describe the severity of their Raynaud's phenomenon in the past week. The distance from the left edge of the line to the vertical line placed by the participant was measured in centimeters; VAS scores were converted to a 0 to 100 scale.</description>

        <description>During a right heart catheterization, a catheter is guided to the right side of the heart and then into the pulmonary artery; blood flow through the heart is observed and is used to measure pressures in a participant's heart and lungs. The calculation of Pulmonary Vascular Resistance (PVR) is measured in Woods Units. Change is derived by measuring the difference between Baseline and Week 24 PVR (Week 24 minus Baseline). Higher PVR values indicate worse disease status.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Distance Walked During a Six Minute Walk Test at Week 24 and Week 48</title>
          <description>The six minute walk test measures the distance a participant is able to walk over a total of six minutes on a hard, flat surface. The goal is for the participant to walk as far as possible in six minutes. The participant is allowed to self-pace and rest as needed as they traverse back and forth along a marked walkway. The total distance walked, in meters, was recorded for each participant. Longer distances indicate better outcomes.</description>

        <description>The SF-36 measures health-related quality of life. It has 36 items and 2 component scores, the Physical Component Score and the Mental Component Score. The SF-36 Physical component summary score is comprised of the Physical Functioning Scale, the Role-Physical Scale, the Bodily Pain Scale, and the General Health Scale. It is scaled from 0 to 100 with a score of 0 equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability. A negative value indicates a decrease in quality of life from Baseline.</description>
