  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2008 a research study conducted by Dr. Barth involving 46 women determined that whole&#xD;
      breast radiation therapy performed after a lumpectomy of borderline and malignant phyllodes&#xD;
      tumors decreases rate of recurrence. None of the 46 participants developed a local&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on information we have learned from research studies, we recommend whole breast&#xD;
      radiation therapy for women with malignant and borderline phyllodes tumors after they receive&#xD;
      a lumpectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New methods for delivering breast radiotherapy are being developed that allow radiation to be&#xD;
      delivered solely to the site of the surgical resection. This is called partial breast&#xD;
      radiation. The main advantage of partial breast radiation is that it simplifies treatment for&#xD;
      the patient. Radiation is delivered twice a day for 5 days, rather than 5 days per week for 6&#xD;
      weeks. The main concern is that partial breast radiation might miss other sites of breast&#xD;
      cancer in the breast receiving the radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence is accumulating from research studies that partial breast radiation therapy after&#xD;
      surgical removal of the more common type of breast cancer, invasive ductal carcinoma, the&#xD;
      breast results in rates of local recurrence that are comparable to those seen after whole&#xD;
      breast radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to patients with invasive ductal cancers of the breast, it is very rare for&#xD;
      patients to have phyllodes tumors that appear in more than one area of the breast. Review of&#xD;
      research data determined that cancer recurrences seen in patients with phyllodes tumors that&#xD;
      had undergone lumpectomies were almost always at the original tumor site. Therefore, partial&#xD;
      breast radiation is likely to be as effective as whole breast radiation therapy after&#xD;
      resection of malignant phyllodes tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine what the chances are that a phyllodes tumor will&#xD;
      recur in the breast when the breast is treated with partial breast radiation therapy after a&#xD;
      lumpectomy.&#xD;

    <description>Radiation therapy will be administered in the vicinity of the center where the surgical resection was performed. Adjuvant radiation must start within 12 weeks of breast excision or re-excision. The radiation oncologist can choose between two methods of partial breast irradiation (PBI): external beam partial breast radiation or MammositeÂ® brachytherapy, based on radiation oncologist and patient preference. Radiation will be administered per guidelines used in the NSABP B-39/RTOG 0413 protocol.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologic proof of phyllodes tumor of borderline or malignant grade, as first defined&#xD;
             by Pietruszka and modified by Azzopardi and adopted by the World Health Organization&#xD;
             (1,2,17):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Borderline malignant: 5-9 mitoses/10 HPF, pushing or infiltrating margins, 2+&#xD;
                  (moderate) stromal cellularity and atypia.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Malignant: 10 or more mitoses / 10 HPF, predominantly infiltrating margins,&#xD;
                  usually 3+ (severe) stromal cellularity and atypia but occasionally 2+.&#xD;
