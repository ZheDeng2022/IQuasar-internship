  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To exploit the curative potential of allografting, the ultimate clinical goal is to separate&#xD;
      GVL from GVHD. In murine preclinical models, recipients of allogeneic hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplants after a preparative regimen of total lymphoid irradiation (TLI) and antithymocyte&#xD;
      globulin (ATG) did not develop GVHD. The murine TLI/ATG study was turned into a clinical&#xD;
      phase I protocol for patients with hematological malignancies, and a reduction of acute GVHD&#xD;
      to &lt; 3% was observed (Lowsky R et al, N Engl J Med). This suggests that specific immune&#xD;
      mechanisms control GVHD and preserve GVL. The study will include patients with lympho and&#xD;
      myeloproliferative diseases. The conditioning regimen will consist of TLI [ten 80 cGy&#xD;
      fractions on day -11 through day -7 and on day -4 through day -1; the radiation field (four&#xD;
      fields-two anterior and two posterior) involves all major lymphoid organs including the&#xD;
      thymus, spleen and lymph nodes] and ATG (five i.v. doses at 1.5 mg/kg/day from day -11&#xD;
      through day -7). G-CSF mobilised hematopoietic cells, collected on days -1 and 0, from&#xD;
      HLA-identical siblings or unrelated donors will be infused on day 0. Post-transplant&#xD;
      immunosuppression will consist of oral cyclosporine (at 6.25 mg/kg/d) from day -3 and&#xD;
      micophenolate mophetile (at 15 mg/Kg bid) from day +1. The clinical primary objective is to&#xD;
      reduce the incidence of GVHD to &lt; 5%, with better survival and quality of life.&#xD;

      PATIENT ENROLMENT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 15 patients / year will be enrolled in this phase I-II protocol.&#xD;
      Patient selection will be based on the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Any patient with one of the following lympho or myeloproliferative malignancies or&#xD;
           syndromes in whom allogeneic NST is warranted. Patients with other selected&#xD;
           malignancies/disorders may also be considered but must be approved by the transplant&#xD;
           team and the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient age &gt; 50 years, or for patients &lt;50 years of age but because of pre-existing&#xD;
           medical conditions or prior therapy are considered to be at high risk for&#xD;
           regimen-related toxicity associated with conventional myeloablative transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. an HLA-identical sibling or matched unrelated donor is available. Patients with one&#xD;
           antigen mismatched donors can be considered but only after discussion with the&#xD;
           transplant team and the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEM CELL TRANSPLANTATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (A) TLI Administration: see &quot;brief description&quot; (B) ATG: Thymoglobulin will be administered&#xD;
      five times intravenously at 1.5 mg/kg/day from day -11 through day -7 for a total dose of 7.5&#xD;
      mg/kg. Thymoglobulin doses will be based on the adjusted ideal body weight. Premedication for&#xD;
      thymoglobulin will include solumedrol 1.0 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilized PBPC: The minimum cell doses (based on recipient body weight) for transplants are &gt;&#xD;
      5x106 CD34+ cells/kg. Cells collected on days -1 and 0 will be pooled and processed for&#xD;
      infusion on day 0. Fresh cells (not frozen) are to be infused. For related donor transplants,&#xD;
      if the target cell dose is not achieved then a third apheresis procedure may be performed on&#xD;
      day+1 and the cells infused on the same day. Collection of cells for unrelated donor&#xD;
      transplants will be coordinated through the Italian bone Marrow Transplant Registry and&#xD;
      subject to the rules of that Program. If mobilized PBPC is not available through certain&#xD;
      collection centers then bone marrow will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (F) Cyclosporine (CSP): CSP is given at 6.25 mg/kg p.o. b.i.d (9 a.m and 9 p.m.) from day -3&#xD;
      until after the day +56 chimerism results are obtained. CSP will be tapered after the day +56&#xD;
      chimerism results are obtained. If the day +56 chimerism results show &gt;40% donor cells in the&#xD;
      CD3+ lineage, and the patient is without evidence of GVHD then CSP taper will begin. The CSP&#xD;
      will be tapered at 6% every week. Modifications of the taper schedule may be indicated if&#xD;
      significant disease progression occurs early post-transplantation or the patient develops&#xD;
      GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (G) Mycophenylate mofetil (MMF): Administration of MMF will begin at 15 mg/kg po on day 0, at&#xD;
      5-10 hours after mobilized PBPC infusion is complete. Thereafter,beginning on day +1 MMF is&#xD;
      taken at 15 mg/kg po b.i.d. (30 mg/kg/day) if transplantation was using a matched related&#xD;
      donor and 15 mg/kg po t.i.d if from a matched unrelated donor or a one antigen mismatched&#xD;
      donor. Doses will be rounded up to the nearest 250 mg (capsules are 250 mg). MMF will be&#xD;
      stopped on day +28 for matched related donors and for one antigen mismatched or unrelated&#xD;
      donors beginning day +40 MMF will be tapered by 10% weekly till off, typically by day +96.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POST-TRANSPLANT FOLLOW-UP&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical: The incidence, severity and extent of acute and chronic GVHD will be monitored and&#xD;
      scored according to standard criteria. As well, documented and presumed post-transplant&#xD;
      infectious complications, rate of relapse, event-free and overall survival and transplant&#xD;
      related mortality will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of Disease Response: Since the diseases treated on this protocol are heterogenous,&#xD;
      appropriate disease specific studies will be performed to evaluate response to transplant.&#xD;
      Responses will be classified as continued complete remission (CCR), achieved complete&#xD;
      remission (CRa), partial response (PR), progressive disease (PD), or no response (NR).&#xD;
      Disease response will be according to accepted criteria. All cases of progressive disease&#xD;
      should be discussed with the Principal Investigators. If patients show evidence of&#xD;
      progressive disease then they may be candidates for donor lymphocyte infusion.&#xD;
