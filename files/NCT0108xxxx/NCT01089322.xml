  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several studies have demonstrated the efficacy of asthma treatment but despite being&#xD;
      correctly diagnosed, conveniently prescribed and adherent to the therapeutics, 5% to 10% of&#xD;
      asthmatics do not reach disease control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to measure asthma control, evaluate inflammatory and functional&#xD;
      characteristics, describe comorbidities and aggravating factors and phenotypes derived from&#xD;
      the characteristics of a severe asthmatic population followed at an outpatient university&#xD;
      service in Sao Paolo, Brazil.&#xD;

      Study design: interventional&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-four severe asthma patients, aged between 18 and 65 years old were recruited from the&#xD;
      outpatient clinics of the Pulmonary Division of the University of São Paolo Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severe asthma were defined according to GINA. Intervention: after 2 weeks screening period&#xD;
      patients were treated with high inhaled corticosteroid dose plus long acting beta 2 agonist&#xD;
      during 12 weeks plus oral corticosteroid ( prednisone 40 mg/day) during 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures ( baseline, after 2 weeks and 12 weeks): asthma control questionnaire (ACQ),&#xD;
      asthma control (ACT) test, lung function test, quality of life questionnaire (SGRQ and&#xD;
      SF-36), exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO), induced sputum (IS). After 12 weeks patients underwent&#xD;
      the following evaluation: Upper Digestive Endoscopy, Esophageal 24hs pHmetry, High Resolution&#xD;
      Chest Tomography, Nasoscope exam,Bronchofibroscopy with endobronchial biopsy.&#xD;
