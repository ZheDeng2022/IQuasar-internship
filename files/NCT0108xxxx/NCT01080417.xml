      The objective of the study is to compare the bioavailability and characterise the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile of Mycophenolate mofetil 250 mg capsules Panacea Biotech Ltd, India&#xD;
      and Cellcept® 250 mg capsules Mycophenolate mofetil capsule, Roche Labs Inc. New Jersey, USA&#xD;
      in normal, healthy, adult human subjects under fed conditions, and to assess the&#xD;
      bioequivalence.&#xD;

      72 + 12 (stand-by) normal healthy adult subjects will be enrolled in the study. Subjects will&#xD;
      be administered either the Test or the Reference Product with 240 mL of water in each period&#xD;
      as per the randomization schedule. Subjects will fast for at least 10 hours prior to High Fat&#xD;
      Breakfast half an hour before administration of the study drug and for four (4) additional&#xD;
      hours each, post dose during each study period. Standardized meals will be provided in each&#xD;
      study period. Water will not be accessible to the subjects 1 hour Predose and 2 hours Post&#xD;
      dose in each period.A total of 27 blood samples will be withdrawn for pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      profiling. The concentration of mycophenolate mofetil and mycophenolic acid will be&#xD;
      quantitated using validated LC-MS / MS method.ANOVA, two one-sided tests for bioequivalence,&#xD;
      power and ratio analysis for un-transformed and ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters&#xD;
      Cmax, AUC0-t AUC0-inf will be computed and reported for Mycophenolic acid. Bioequivalence of&#xD;
      the test product with that of the reference product under fasting conditions will be&#xD;
      concluded if the 90% confidence interval falls within the acceptance range of 80.00-125.00%&#xD;
      for ln-transformed pharmacokinetic parameters Cmax, AUC0-t and AUC0-inf for Mycophenolic&#xD;
      acid.&#xD;
