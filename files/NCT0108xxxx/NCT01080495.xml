    <textblock>
      Assessment of left ventricular function is an essential determinant of overall hemodynamics&#xD;
      and heart function and therefore of central interest in intra-operative transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the most frequently used methods for quantification of left ventricular function&#xD;
      are fractional shortening (FS) and fractional area change (FAC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial strain is a new parameter to asses left ventricular function. The investigators want&#xD;
      to assess left ventricular function with radial strain, fractional shortening (FS) and&#xD;
      fractional area change (FAC) in non-cardiac patients during non-cardiac operations. The aim&#xD;
      of this study is to show that radial strain is as reliable as FS and FAC in left ventricular&#xD;
      function assessment and more robust to changes in preload and afterload conditions.&#xD;

      Assessment of left ventricular function is an essential determinant of overall hemodynamics&#xD;
      and heart function and therefore of central interest in intra-operative transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the most frequently used methods for quantification of left ventricular function&#xD;
      are fractional shortening (FS) and fractional area change (FAC). These parameters can be&#xD;
      assessed in the transgastric mid papillary short axis view (TG SAX) to quantify left&#xD;
      ventricular systolic function. Limitations of these methods are the experience of the&#xD;
      investigator - the more experienced the investigator the more reliable and reproducible the&#xD;
      data are, load dependency of these methods and the geometrical assumption of a&#xD;
      one-dimensional measurement for assessment of a three-dimensional contracting left ventricle.&#xD;
      Therefore, LV-function will either be over- or underestimated by influence of segmental wall&#xD;
      motion abnormalities or by missing them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radial strain allows reliable and reproducible evaluation of left ventricular function and&#xD;
      also allows assessment of myocardial deformation from representative segments of each wall of&#xD;
      the left ventricle. Myocardial strain is described as the relative deformation of a&#xD;
      myocardial fiber, normalized to its original length:L1-L0/L0(%). Strain is positive (radial&#xD;
      thickening) if L1&gt;L0 and negative (longitudinal shortening and circumferential thinning) if&#xD;
      L1&lt;L0. Radial strain is sensitive to changes in contractility and less influenced by loading&#xD;
      conditions which occur frequently during anaesthesia in a wide spectrum of non-cardiac&#xD;
      surgery as a result of blood loss or loss of hemodynamic autoregulation due to anesthetic&#xD;
      drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore we want to assess left ventricular function with radial strain, fractional&#xD;
      shortening (FS) and fractional area change (FAC) in non-cardiac patients during non-cardiac&#xD;
      operations. The aim of this study is to show that radial strain is as reliable as FS and FAC&#xD;
      in left ventricular function assessment and more robust to changes in preload and afterload&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to compare fractional shortening (FS) and fractional area change&#xD;
      (FAC) with radial strain from TG mid SAX using TEE in the anaesthetized patient undergoing&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery. Furthermore we want to investigate the influence of changes in loading&#xD;
      conditions on these parameters in the anaesthetized non-cardiac patient undergoing&#xD;
      non-cardiac surgery. Therefore patients are examined in zero position, trendelenburg- and&#xD;
      anti-trendelenburg-position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radial strain correlates with FAC and FS in assessment of left ventricular function in&#xD;
           patients undergoing non-cardiac surgery. FAC is of primary interest because it has&#xD;
           several advantages: it is very easy to calculate, itÂ´s considered a surrogate of&#xD;
           ejection fraction, and several studies have shown that it is an excellent measure of&#xD;
           left ventricular function even in patients with heterogeneity of regional function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The parameters radial strain, fractional shortening and fractional area change correlate&#xD;
           during are changes in loading conditions (zero-position, trendelenburg- and&#xD;
           anti-trendelenburg-maneuver).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: prospective cohort study Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned non-cardiac surgery with a minimum duration of 60 minutes, where intubation is&#xD;
           indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age above 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No patient's consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects not able to understand study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraindications to transesophageal echocardiography (oesophageal-, gastric disorders,&#xD;
           hematologic disorders with increased bleeding incidence, ENT-surgery, surgery of the&#xD;
           oesophagus or stomach)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history of any kind of heart disease, dyspnea or angina pectoris&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypertension (medically treated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Atrial fibrillation Study protocol One day prior to surgery the patients are screened&#xD;
           and invited to participate in the study by the principle investigator. If they consent&#xD;
           the principle investigator does a physical examination and takes their medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of surgery patients receive premedication as usual. Arriving at the operating room&#xD;
      the patients are monitored with ECG, pulse oximetry and blood pressure (either invasive with&#xD;
      insertion of an arterial catheter, when indicated, or non-invasive blood pressure). A&#xD;
      peripheral venous line is needed for induction of anaesthesia. Induction and maintenance of&#xD;
      anaesthesia is performed using standard protocols. After induction of anaesthesia and&#xD;
      insertion of all needed catheters (central venous catheter, bladder catheter, arterial&#xD;
      catheter, and eventually pulmonary artery catheter) the transoesophageal probe, covered with&#xD;
      a special condom, will be inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination will be done by the principle investigator (Dr. Ulrike Weber) under&#xD;
      supervision of an expierenced investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative TEE-Examinations (T1, T2, T3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      At T1, T2, T3 TEE-study examinations are performed in zero position, Trendelenburg position,&#xD;
      and anti-Trendelenburg position. Positioning will follow a random order according to a&#xD;
      blinded randomization list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trendelenburg-position shall be defined for the study with 10cm head-down from horizontal&#xD;
      position, anti-trendelenburg position with 10cm head-up (from horizontal position). After&#xD;
      positioning examination will start after a 3 min delay for reaching a steady-state in loading&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1 - after induction of anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      After insertion of the probe a transesophageal echo examination (TEE) is performed -&#xD;
      including a complete routine clinical examination (T1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      T2 - Intraoperative TEE, 3min after positioning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positioning (zero position, Trendelenburg, anti-trendelenburg) will be performed according to&#xD;
      randomization. 3min after positioning, under stable hemodynamics, recordings of HR, blood&#xD;
      pressure, FS, FAC, Radial strain&#xD;
&#xD;
      T3 - Intraoperative TEE, 3min after positioning&#xD;
&#xD;
      Positioning (zero position, Trendelenburg, anti-trendelenburg) will be performed according to&#xD;
      randomization. 3min after positioning, under stable hemodynamics, recordings of HR, blood&#xD;
      pressure, FS, FAC, Radial strain&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following measurements are taken for the study (3 times during sinus rhythm):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FS in the transgastric short axis mid papillary view&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FAC in the transgastric short axis mid papillary view&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radial strain in the transgastric short axis mid papillary view&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recordings of the 2D-mode images of the TG SAX shall be taken in triplicate with 3 heart&#xD;
      cycles per stored clip. The images will be stored digitally in the EchoPAC-raw data format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of data will be performed offline in a dedicated work station (EchoPAC, GE Vingmed,&#xD;
      Horten, Norway). Three different investigators will analyse all data two times at two&#xD;
      different time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected study population: 33 patients&#xD;
