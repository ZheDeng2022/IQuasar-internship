      episodes and no rescue medication in the first 120 hours post-chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CR rates for acute (0-24 h) and delayed (24-120 h) phases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete control rate (CC) defined as no emetic episode, no rescue medication use and no&#xD;
           more than mild nausea;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of emetic episodes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  severity of nausea;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impact of CINV on daily life as measured by the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE)&#xD;
           (total score &gt; 108 = no impact);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peripheral blood stem cell harvest;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tolerability (adverse events, drug-related adverse events, serious adverse events;&#xD;
           discontinuation of treatment due to an adverse event). Adverse events will be classified&#xD;
           using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of patients A total of 120 patients will be enrolled Inclusion criteria - Male or&#xD;
      female patients ≥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is able to understand study procedure and agrees to participate in the study by&#xD;
           giving written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient is scheduled to receive a highly emetogenic cyclophosphamide IV chemotherapy (3&#xD;
           g/m2) for autologous PBSC harvesting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Karnofsky score ≥60&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal laboratory values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal ECG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HBV-, HCV- and HIV- negative&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative urine pregnancy test for women of childbearing age Treatment Eligible patients&#xD;
           will be randomized to receive oral doses of Aprepitant (125 mg day 1, 80 mg days 2 and&#xD;
           3), dexamethasone (8 mg/day for 3 days) and a single intravenous dose of palonosetron&#xD;
           (0.25 mg on day 1) versus placebo plus dexamethasone (8 mg/day for 3 days) and a single&#xD;
           intravenous dose of palonosetron (0.25 mg on day 1) Duration of study 3 years Criteria&#xD;
           for evaluation Efficacy and safety data will be obtained using the patient's daily diary&#xD;
           (days 1 through 5) reporting the number of episodes of retching and vomiting, severity&#xD;
           of nausea (using a categorical scale of none, mild, moderate or severe), and overall&#xD;
           quality of life. The FLIE 8 questionnaire will be completed on days 1 (before starting&#xD;
           chemotherapy) and 6 (after chemotherapy). All side effects attributed to this&#xD;
           combination therapy will be recorded daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters: medical history, clinical examination and weight, vital signs, laboratory&#xD;
      tests (hematology, chemistry, urine analysis and urine pregnancy test for women of&#xD;
      childbearing age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical aspects Sample size was defined assuming the cumulative incidence rate of the&#xD;
      primary endpoint to be 68% in the treatment group and 41% in the control group. With balanced&#xD;
      allocation in the two groups, considering a two sided test with α=0.05 and ß=0.20 a total of&#xD;
      110 patients is needed. As few withdrawals and drop-outs are expected a total of 120 patients&#xD;
      will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to treat approach will be used for all efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint will&#xD;
      be analysed by binomial logistic models. The dependent variable will be vomiting yes/no&#xD;
      during the first 120 hours after chemotherapy. Anti-emetic treatment, gender and age will&#xD;
      enter as explicative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dichotomous secondary endpoints will also be analysed by binomial logistic models.&#xD;
      Multinomial logistic models will analyze the severity of nausea, stratified in 4 classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized Linear Models will investigate quantitative variables such as number of retching&#xD;
      or vomiting episodes and peripheral blood stem cell harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all tests, p value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. No interim analyses&#xD;
      are planned.&#xD;

      1. Background and rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing demand for the apheresis service makes efficient harvesting of peripheral blood&#xD;
      stem cells (PBCS) essential. To reduce hospital stays for autologous peripheral blood stem&#xD;
      cell collection we have recently started an out-patient regimen with highly emetogenic,&#xD;
      intermediate doses of cyclophosphamide (3 g/m2) 1. Despite prophylaxis with&#xD;
      5-hydroxytryptamine 3 (5-HT3) receptor antagonists and dexamethasone, chemotherapy-induced&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting (CINV) remain a major problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aprepitant (EMEND) is the first commercially available drug from a new class of agents, the&#xD;
      substance P/neurokinin NK-1 receptor antagonists. Oral aprepitant, in combination with the&#xD;
      5-hydroxytriptamine-3 (5-HT3) serotonin receptor antagonist and dexamethasone, is recommended&#xD;
      before highly emetogenic chemotherapy 2-5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since aprepitant moderately inhibits CYP3A4, concomitant administration of aprepitant and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide might decrease cyclophosphamide clearance and, consequently, reduce exposure&#xD;
      to its active metabolite 6, thus impairing efficacy of autologous stem cell mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study is designed to demonstrate that,&#xD;
      without impacting upon toxicity and stem cell harvesting, the&#xD;
      aprepitant-palonosetron-dexamethasone regimen is better than palonosetron-dexamethasone&#xD;
      therapy in the prevention of CINV 2,7.&#xD;
&#xD;

      6. Assessments tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy data will be obtained using the patient's daily diary (days 1 through 5) reporting&#xD;
      episodes of retching and vomiting, severity of nausea (using a categorical scale of none,&#xD;
      mild, moderate or severe), and overall quality of life. The FLIE8 questionnaire will be&#xD;
      completed on days 1 (before starting chemotherapy) and 6 (after chemotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Safety data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety parameters: medical history, physical examination and weight, vital signs, laboratory&#xD;
      tests (hematology, chemistry, urine analysis and urine pregnancy test for women of&#xD;
      childbearing age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All side effects attributed to combination therapy will be recorded using the patient's daily&#xD;
      diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Criteria of evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Complete response (CR): no emetic episodes and no rescue medication in the first 120 hours&#xD;
      post-chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Complete control (CC): no emetic episode, no use of rescue medication and no more than mild&#xD;
      nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Statistical consideration&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1 Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was defined assuming the cumulative incidence rate of the primary endpoint to be&#xD;
      68% in the treatment group and 41% in the control group (see references 2 and 7). With&#xD;
      balanced allocation in the two groups, considering a two sided test with α=0.05 and ß=0.20 a&#xD;
      total of 110 patients is needed. As few withdrawals and drop-outs are expected a total of 120&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Statistical analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intention to treat approach will be used for all efficacy analysis. The primary endpoint will&#xD;
      be analysed by binomial logistic models. The dependent variable will be vomiting yes/no&#xD;
      during the first 120 hours after chemotherapy. Anti-emetic treatment, gender and age will&#xD;
      enter as explicative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dichotomous secondary endpoints will also be analysed by binomial logistic models.&#xD;
      Multinomial logistic models will analyze the severity of nausea, stratified in 4 classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Generalized Linear Models will investigate quantitative variables such as number of retching&#xD;
      or vomiting episodes and peripheral blood stem cell harvest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all tests, p value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant. No interim analyses&#xD;
      are planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.3 Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint: complete response (CR) rate defined as the number of patients with no&#xD;
      emetic episodes and no rescue medication in the first 120 hours post-chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - CR rates for acute (0-24 h) and delayed (24-120 h) phases;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  complete control rate (CC) defined as no emetic episode, no use of rescue medication and&#xD;
           no more than mild nausea;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  number of emetic episodes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  severity of nausea;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  impact of CINV on daily life as measured by the Functional Living Index-Emesis (FLIE)&#xD;
           (total score &gt; 108 = no impact);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peripheral blood stem cell harvest;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tolerability (adverse events, drug-related adverse events, serious adverse events;&#xD;
           discontinuation of treatment due to an adverse event). Adverse events will be classified&#xD;
           using NCI Common Toxicity Criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
           9. Adverse events (Definitions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      AE: An Adverse Event is defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or clinical&#xD;
      trial subject to whom a medicinal product is administered and which not necessarily have a&#xD;
      causal relationship with this treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable&#xD;
      and unintended signs (such as rash or enlarged liver), symptoms (such as nausea or chest&#xD;
      pain), an abnormal laboratory finding (including blood tests, x-rays or scans) or a disease&#xD;
      that is temporarily associated with use of the protocol treatment, whether or not it is&#xD;
      considered to be related to the investigational medicinal product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AR: An Adverse reaction of an investigational medicinal product is any untoward and&#xD;
      unintended responses to an investigational medicinal product at any dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All adverse events wich either the reporting investigator or the sponsor judge as having a&#xD;
      reasonable causal relationship to a medicinal product qualify as adverse reactions. The&#xD;
      expression reasonable causal relationship means to convey in general that there is evidence&#xD;
      or argument to suggest a causal relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UAR: An Unexpected Adverse Reaction is any adverse reaction, the nature, or severity of which&#xD;
      is not consistent with applicable product information (e.g. investigator's brochure for an&#xD;
      unapproved investigational product or summary of product characteristics (SmPC) for an&#xD;
      authorised product).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the outcome of the adverse reaction is not consistent with the applicable product&#xD;
      information this adverse reaction should be considered as unexpected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Severity: The term &quot;severe&quot; is often used to describe the intensity (severity) of a specific&#xD;
      event. This is not the same as &quot;serious,&quot; which is based on patient/event outcome or action&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAE: A Serious Adverse Event is defined as any undesirable experience occurring to a patient,&#xD;
      whether or not considered related to the protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAR: A Serious Adverse Event (SAE) which is considered related to the protocol treatment is&#xD;
      defined as a Serious Adverse Reaction&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Adverse Event or Adverse Reaction which is considered as serious:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in death,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is life-threatening (i.e. an event in which the subject was at risk of death at the time&#xD;
           of event; it does not refer to an event which hypothetically might have caused death if&#xD;
           it were more severe)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  requires hospitalisation or prolongation of existing inpatients' hospitalisation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in persistent or significant disability or incapacity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in a congenital anomaly or birth defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  results in any other major medical condition (i.e. important adverse reactions that are&#xD;
           not immediately life threatening or do not result in death or hospitalization but may&#xD;
           jeopardize the patient or may require intervention to prevent one of the other outcomes&#xD;
           listed above).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUSAR: Suspected Unexpected Serious Adverse Reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be informed about&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the aims of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the possible adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the procedures and possible hazards to which the patient will be exposed&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the mechanism of treatment allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  strict confidentiality of any patient data&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical records possibly being reviewed for trial purposes by authorized individuals&#xD;
           other than their treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The template of the patient's informed consent statement is given as an appendix to this&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informed consent documents are to be submitted to the Ethics Committees for approval. The&#xD;
      competent Ethics Committee for each institution must approve the informed consent documents&#xD;
      before the center can join the study. It is emphasized in the patient information sheet that&#xD;
      participation is voluntary and that the patient is free to refuse further participation in&#xD;
      the protocol whenever he/she wants to. This will not have any impact on the patient's&#xD;
      subsequent care. Documented informed consent must be obtained for all patients included in&#xD;
      the study before they are registered and/or randomized. The written informed consent form&#xD;
      must be signed and personally dated by the patient or by the patient's legally acceptable&#xD;
      representative.&#xD;
