  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a randomised controlled trial examining whether a new type of needle free&#xD;
      access device(TEGO) is associated with less episodes of infection of dialysis lines, when&#xD;
      compared to the current gold standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesise that there will be less handling of the dialysis line by&#xD;
      nursing staff and thus this will lead to lower rates of infection. The investigators will&#xD;
      also assess whether these access devices lead to alterations in catheter blood flow rates&#xD;
      when compared to the current gold standard.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infection is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with ESKD. Examining&#xD;
      the USRDS database, it is the second leading cause of death in these patients . Several&#xD;
      studies in the past number of years have highlighted permanent vascular access devices as&#xD;
      independent risk factors for the development of sepsis .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 50% of haemodialysis patients in Beaumont Hospital use permanent central&#xD;
      catheters, often while awaiting alternative vascular access, such as arterio-venous fistulae&#xD;
      or when other avenues of vascular access have been exhausted. International data has shown&#xD;
      that patients with permanent vascular access devices have 50% higher infection rates compared&#xD;
      to those with a native fistula .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Permanent central venous catheters used in haemodialysis are tunnelled cuffed dual lumen&#xD;
      catheters usually composed of silicone or polyurethane materials. These are usually placed in&#xD;
      the right internal jugular vein. Tunnelled haemodialysis catheters are placed in the&#xD;
      radiology department under fluoroscopic guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of catheter related bacteraemia is often treated with intravenous antibiotics&#xD;
      such as vancomycin or gentamycin, however a study of 100 haemodialysis patients in Ann Int&#xD;
      Med in 1997 has shown that attempts to treat bacteraemia without removal of the catheter&#xD;
      usually fail . In such cases, removal of the catheter and insertion of another at either the&#xD;
      same or another site is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of reducing catheter related bacteraemia such as intensive hygiene education, the use&#xD;
      of cuffed catheters and the use of prophylactic antibiotic therapy have all been employed,&#xD;
      however with limited success&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesised that repeated opening and handling of the catheter increase the risk of&#xD;
      bacteraemia, and so a closed luer lock access device would reduce bacteraemia rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown reductions in catheter bacteraemia when closed luer lock devices&#xD;
      were used in an ITU setting . Little data exists on infection rates in out patient&#xD;
      haemodialysis setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study in NDT examining the blood flow resistance of these closed lock access devices&#xD;
      show values within safe ranges, suggesting that these devices can safely be used in the out&#xD;
      patient haemodialysis setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify if a closed luer lock access devices can result in lower rates of bacteraemia&#xD;
      and/or sepsis in patients receiving haemodialysis through a permanent vascular catheter when&#xD;
      compared to current practise methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary End Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Episodes of bacteraemia or line sepsis requiring antibiotic therapy. Bacteraemia will be&#xD;
      defined as positive blood culture specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bacteraemia will be defined as any episode of temperature &gt; 38º or &lt;36º will be an indication&#xD;
      to perform blood cultures, as will cellulitis around catheter sites. A positive blood culture&#xD;
      result will be labelled a catheter related bacteraemia if no other obvious source of&#xD;
      infection is noted. The physician attending the patient for the above reasons will perform a&#xD;
      full physical exam and request an MSU if possible from all patients seen to aid accuracy of&#xD;
      results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary End Points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal blood flow rates in the closed luer lock devices when compared to the standard access&#xD;
      devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal blood flow rates will be recorded by the haemodialysis nursing staff at each dialysis&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of line obstruction requiring thrombolytic therapy in the closed luer lock device&#xD;
      when compared to standard devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of thrombolytic use will be recorded by the attending haemodialysis nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hypothesises that closed luer lock access devices will lead to significantly&#xD;
      reduced rates of catheter related bacteraemia, and thus reduced patient morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. It is also hypothesised that renal blood flow rates will be higher in the TEGO&#xD;
      study group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be designed as a one centre prospective randomised case control study, taking&#xD;
      place in Beaumont Hospital in St Martin's dialysis wards and St Peter's dialysis ward over a&#xD;
      twelve month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It shall run from December 2009 to December 2010, with the aim of recruiting 100 patients for&#xD;
      the study, 50 patients in the control group and 50 in the treatment group. All patients will&#xD;
      receive fully informed written consent prior to entering the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomised into both groups using sequentially numbered, opaque sealed&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may withdraw from the study at any time with no implications for his/her&#xD;
      haemodialysis treatment regime. Patients who undergo transplantation during the trial will be&#xD;
      removed from the study at that time, and data collected up to the time of transplantation&#xD;
      will be incorporated into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria Patients recruited will be over 18 and have been on haemodialysis for&#xD;
      greater than one month, have permanent cuffed vascular access lines in place and will be&#xD;
      receiving haemodialysis through these lines three times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will not have had a documented episode of bacteraemia or sepsis for greater than 4&#xD;
      weeks, and will not be using antibiotic coated dialysis lines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Patients with immunosuppressive illnesses such as HIV, cancer or patients&#xD;
      who regularly use glucocorticoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study group Patients in the study group will use TEGO® devices on both access ports, which&#xD;
      will be changed after one week or 25 uses. This device which costs €2.30, and will be&#xD;
      supplied gratis by Fannin Ltd Dublin and ICU Medical Inc, San Clemente USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEGO® devices will be accessed by the haemodialysis nursing staff using aseptic technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group Patients in the control group will continue to receive haemodialysis using the&#xD;
      current standard of care protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Bacteraemia rates from each group will be recorded by the haemodialysis&#xD;
      nursing staff and subsequently will be inputted into a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet. Further&#xD;
      analysis including comparison of both patient groups will take place using SPSS software.&#xD;
      Data will only be stored on a hospital server, and will only be accessible by members of the&#xD;
      research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power of the study will be calculated using Fisher's combined probability test, where&#xD;
      Test Ho: p1=p2, where p1 is in proportion in population 1 and p2 is in proportion in&#xD;
      population 2. Assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha = 0.0500 (two sided) Power = 0.8000 P1 = 0.17 P2 = 0.000 N2/N1 = 1.00&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated sample sizes&#xD;
&#xD;
      N1 = 53 N2 = 53&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequent data analysis will include comparison of outcomes using a student's t test and&#xD;
      subsequent formation of Kaplan Meier curves.&#xD;
