  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of hand function is one of the most devastating consequences of tetraplegia because of&#xD;
      the severe impact on activities of daily living (ADL) and the resultant dependency on others.&#xD;
      This multi-centre study in 78 participants will measure whether additional hand therapy&#xD;
      provided via an electrical stimulator glove and specialised computer workstation improves&#xD;
      hand function in people with tetraplegia.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-centre, assessor-blind, randomised controlled phase III trial in&#xD;
      patients with tetraplegia (a spinal cord injury). A total of 78 participants will be&#xD;
      randomised into two groups; 1. the experimental group and 2. the control group. The control&#xD;
      group will receive their standard rehabilitation care, while the experimental group will&#xD;
      receive the standard rehabilitation care plus the study treatment. The study treatment will&#xD;
      consist of one hour of extra hand training, 5 times a week, using a specialised glove which&#xD;
      provides electrical impulses to the patient's hand allowing them to open and close their&#xD;
      hand. The glove will be used to play games on a specialised computer workstation which&#xD;
      focuses on hand movement and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to determine if the experimental treatment is more&#xD;
      effective than standard rehabilitation care alone in participants with tetraplegia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration is 3 years, including an 18 month recruitment period, an 8-week&#xD;
      treatment period followed by 6 month and 12 month follow up assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progress of the participant's therapy during the study will be assessed by a blinded&#xD;
      assessor (the assessor will not know which group the participants are in) using standard&#xD;
      physiotherapy and occupational therapy assessments which focus on hand function. These&#xD;
      involve grasping and releasing different everyday objects and performing everyday tasks as&#xD;
      well as quality of life questionnaires.&#xD;

    <description>In addition to standard care participants in Group A will receive:&#xD;
â€¢ One hour of extra hand training five times per week for 8 weeks using the ReJoyce Workstation.&#xD;
The training will be supervised by a therapist and provided to the target hand. The hand exercises will be incorporated into computer games and will involve the following tasks using different manipulanda:&#xD;
reaching&#xD;
grasping&#xD;
manipulating&#xD;
pulling&#xD;
rotating&#xD;
releasing</description>

    <description>Participants in the control group will not receive any training on the instrumented workstation or electrical stimulation to the hand or upper limb. They will however continue to receive standard care as well as three 15-minute specific hand activity sessions per week specifically devoted to the practice of hand activities in a one-to-one format with a therapist (as per the treatment received by the experimental group).</description>

    <description>The device has two parts. A muscle-stimulator garment that incorporates a wireless-triggered stimulator cuff and an earpiece, similar to a hearing aid, that sends a radio signal to the stimulator cuff. As well as a specialised workstation known as ReJoyce, which connects to a standard computer via a USB port. This work station will allow the user to play specialised computer games focusing on hand function. The stimulator system and the ReJoyce workstation were developed by Professor Arthur Prochazka, University of Alberta, Canada and has been approved by the Canadian Standards Association.</description>
