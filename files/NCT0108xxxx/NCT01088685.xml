      Study to evaluate the safety and performance of a new blister patch intended to treat&#xD;
      blisters on the heel of the foot.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will require participation for up to 14 days of participation or less if the&#xD;
      blister heals sooner, will recruit 100 subjects with fluid filled blisters on the heel of the&#xD;
      foot that are intact and not broken. Some subjects will be asked to have their blisters&#xD;
      photographed. All subjects will be required to have their blister unroofed (top layer of skin&#xD;
      removed by the physician using sterile instruments). All subjects will receive study product,&#xD;
      either test product or a marketed product.&#xD;
