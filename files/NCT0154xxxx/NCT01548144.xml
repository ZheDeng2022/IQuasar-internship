  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of Xalkori (crizotinib) either with Votrient (pazopanib) or Alimta (pemetrexed)&#xD;
      or of the combination of 3 study drugs that can be given to patients with advanced cancer.&#xD;
      The safety of these drug combinations will also be studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Crizotinib is designed to block a protein called ALK, which is involved in cancer cell growth&#xD;
      and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib is designed to block the growth of blood vessels that supply nutrients needed for&#xD;
      tumor growth. This may prevent or slow the growth of cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pemetrexed is designed to block proteins that may cause tumors to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Crizotinib is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer. Pazopanib is FDA&#xD;
      approved and commercially available for treatment of advanced renal cell carcinoma.&#xD;
      Pemetrexed is FDA approved and commercially available for the treatment of non-small cell&#xD;
      lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of crizotinib with pazopanib, crizotinib with pemetrexed, pazopanib with&#xD;
      pemetrexed, and giving all 3 drugs together to patients with advanced cancer is&#xD;
      investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 364 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, your doctor will decide if you&#xD;
      will receive one of the following drug combinations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group A, you will receive crizotinib and pazopanib.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group B, you will receive crizotinib and pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group C, you will receive pazopanib and pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you are in Group D, you will receive crizotinib, pazopanib, and pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once it is decided which combination you will receive, you will be assigned to a dose level&#xD;
      based on when you join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 8 dose levels of crizotinib with pazopanib will be tested. Up to 6 dose levels of&#xD;
      crizotinib with pemetrexed will be tested. Up to 6 dose levels of pazopanib with pemetrexed&#xD;
      will be tested. Up to 8 dose levels of pazopanib with pemetrexed and crizotinib will be&#xD;
      tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of participants will receive the lowest dose level. Each new group will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose combination is found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose of each study drug combination is found, up to 14 more&#xD;
      participants may be enrolled to further study the safety of each combination of drugs at that&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 21 days. Drugs should be taken and/or administered simultaneously. On&#xD;
      days of pharmacokinetic testing (if you agree) you should take the drugs at least 1 hour&#xD;
      before or 2 hours after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taking crizotinib, you will take it by mouth at the same time every day&#xD;
      consistently either with or without food. It should be swallowed whole with a glass of water.&#xD;
      You will take the drug every other day, 1 or 2 times a day. You will be told how often to&#xD;
      take this drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are taking pazopanib, you will take it by mouth at the same time every day with a&#xD;
      glass of water. You should take it at least 1 hour before or 2 hours after a meal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you receive pemetrexed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will receive it by vein on Day 1 of each cycle over about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day before your first dose of pemetrexed, you will start taking folic acid to help&#xD;
           lower the risk of side effects. Although the study drug is designed to prevent the body&#xD;
           from making folic acid that could help cancer grow and spread, some folic acid is needed&#xD;
           to prevent side effects in non-cancerous tissue. You will take folic acid by mouth 1&#xD;
           time every day until at least 30 days after you received the last dose of pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The day before your first dose of pemetrexed, you will receive a vitamin B12 injection.&#xD;
           You will receive an injection of Vitamin B12 about every 9 weeks after that. Vitamin B12&#xD;
           is given to help reduce the risks of side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will take dexamethasone by mouth 2 times a day on the day before, the day of, and&#xD;
           the day after you receive pemetrexed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At every study visit, you will be asked about any other drugs or herbal supplements you are&#xD;
      taking and about any side effects you may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Cycles 1 and 2, you will have weekly blood (about 1 tablespoon) collected for routine&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any cancer symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ECG to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks, or earlier if needed, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tumor&#xD;
      marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After about 6 weeks and then every 2-3 cycles after that, you will have a CT scan, x-ray, MRI&#xD;
      scan, and/or PET scan to check the status of the disease. It may be done more often if your&#xD;
      study doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are able to become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine&#xD;
      pregnancy test every 2 cycles or at any time the study doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue taking the study drugs for as long as the doctor thinks it is in your best&#xD;
      interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets worse, if&#xD;
      intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over once you have completed the end-of-dosing and/or&#xD;
      follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Dosing Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 30 days after your last dose of study drugs, you will have an end-of-study visit. If&#xD;
      you are having side effects at the time of this visit, you may have follow-up for a longer&#xD;
      period of time. At this visit, the following tests or procedures may be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your medical history will be recorded, including any cancer symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have had any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of your weight and vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your performance status will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for tumor marker testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an x-ray, CT scan, MRI scan, and/or&#xD;
           PET/CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If your doctor thinks it is needed, you will have an ECG to check your heart function.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with advanced cancer, either refractory to standard therapy or for which no&#xD;
             effective standard therapy that increases survival for at least 3 months is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients must have measurable or evaluable disease, as defined by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Women of child-bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ECOG performance status of 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate organ functions: (Crizotinib plus Pazopanib arm A): Neutrophils &gt; 1000/uL;&#xD;
             Platelets ≥ 75,000/uL; Total bilirubin &lt; or= 2 x ULN (upper limit of normal); ALT &lt; or&#xD;
             = 2.5 x ULN or &lt; o r= 5 x ULN if liver metastases persist; Serum creatinine &lt; 2 x ULN&#xD;
             (Crizotinib plus Pemetrexed arm B, Pazopanib plus Pemetrexed arm C, Crizotinib plus&#xD;
             Pazopanib plus Pemetrexed arm D) Neutrophils &gt; 1500/uL; Platelets &gt; or = 100,000/uL;&#xD;
             Total bilirubin &lt; or = 2 x ULN (upper limit of normal); ALT &lt; or = 2.5 x ULN or &lt; or =&#xD;
             5 x ULN if liver metastases persist; Calculated GFR &gt; 45 mL/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Creatinine Clearance: The standard Cockcroft and Gault formula must be used to&#xD;

             direct sequencing (aCGH). Or patients must have a c-Met abnormality; either c-Met&#xD;
             amplification or c-Met mutation or patients must have the ROS1 translocation as&#xD;
             determined by FISH.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient receiving any concurrent chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;

          7. Patient is pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient has had any treatment specific for tumor control within 3 weeks of dosing with&#xD;
             investigational drugs and cytotoxic agents, or within 2 weeks of cytotoxic agent given&#xD;
             weekly, or within 6 weeks of nitrosoureas or mitomycin C, or within 5 half-lives of&#xD;
             biological targeted agents with half-lives and pharmacodynamic effects lasting less&#xD;
             than 5 days (that includes, but is not limited to, erlotinib, sorafenib, sunitinib,&#xD;
             bortezomib, and other similar agents).&#xD;
