      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) develop problems with thinking and&#xD;
      concentration when the virus affects the brain. This is known as mild neurocognitive disorder&#xD;
      (MND). Research has shown that some HIV medications do not get through the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier very well. P-glycoprotein (P-gp) is a brain protein that is part of the blood brain&#xD;
      barrier. Differences in the activity of P-gp may help explain why some people with HIV&#xD;
      develop MND. It is also possible that MND is partly due to inflammation in the brain.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study P-gp and its effect on MND and HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study P-gp and brain inflammation related to HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who have HIV and either do or do not have&#xD;
           MND.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers between 18 and 60 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have one outpatient visit and one 3-day inpatient stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the outpatient visit, participants will provide blood samples and have a lumbar&#xD;
           puncture (spinal tap). The spinal tap will collect cerebrospinal fluid for study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the inpatient visit, participants will have two positron emission tomography (PET)&#xD;
           scans of the brain. These scans will study brain activity and possible inflammation. One&#xD;
           scan will involve a study drug called tariquidar, which blocks the activity of P-gp. A&#xD;
           second lumbar puncture will be done before the first PET scan. Blood and urine samples&#xD;
           will be collected daily.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the relationship among neuroinflammation, Permeability-glycoprotein (P-gp)&#xD;
      function and mild neurocognitive disorder (MND), a cognitive disorder associated with HIV&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV seropositive subjects with MND, HIV seropositive subjects with normal cognitive function,&#xD;
      and HIV seronegative control subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will undergo history and physical exam, screening laboratory tests, EKG, brain MRI&#xD;
      and neuropsychological evaluation. HIV-seropositive subjects will be stratified based on&#xD;
      results of neuropsychological evaluation into HIV-seropositive controls (i.e., cognitively&#xD;
      normal) and HIV-seropositive with MND. All subjects will receive brain PET imaging with&#xD;
      [11C]dLop after P-gp blockade to measure the function of P-gp at the blood-brain barrier.&#xD;
      P-gp will be blocked prior to the PET scan with tariquidar. HIV-seropositive subjects will&#xD;
      receive one lumbar puncture at baseline and one lumbar puncture after P-gp blockade with&#xD;
      tariquidar to measure CSF concentrations of anti-retroviral medications and to measure&#xD;
      biomarkers of blood-brain barrier integrity and inflammation in the CSF. HIV-seronegative&#xD;
      subjects will receive one lumbar puncture at baseline to measure biomarkers of blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier integrity and inflammation in the CSF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measures of the study is brain uptake of [11C]dLop in response to P-gp&#xD;
      blockade with tariquidar. We will correct for individual metabolism of tariquidar by&#xD;
      measuring the plasma concentration of tariquidar during the P-gp blocked scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a secondary outcome measure, concentrations of anti-retroviral medications in CSF will be&#xD;
      measured in HIV seropositive subjects with and without MND. CSF concentrations will be used&#xD;
      as a surrogate marker for CNS delivery of anti-retroviral drugs.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Subject has an acquired mild-to-moderate impairment in cognitive function documented&#xD;
             by a score of at least 1 SD below demographically corrected norms on testing of at&#xD;

          3. The impairment does not meet DSM-IV criteria for delirium or dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The impairment is not fully explained by co-morbid conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current Axis I psychiatric illness or severe systemic disease (other than HIV and MND)&#xD;
             based on history and physical exam that would make study participation unsafe in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Current alcohol use greater than 14 drinks per week for men and 7 drinks per week for&#xD;
             women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Laboratory tests with clinically significant abnormalities. Normal organ and marrow&#xD;
             function are defined as: total leukocyte count greater than or equal to 3000 cells/ul,&#xD;
             ANC greater than or equal to 1500 cells/ul, platelet count greater than or equal to&#xD;
             100,000 cells/ul, serum creatinine less than or equal to 2.0 times upper limit of&#xD;
             normal, hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL, serum calcium &lt;12.0 mg/dL,&#xD;
             AST/ALT less than or equal to 1.5 times the upper limit of normal, PT 1.5 upper limit&#xD;
             of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. EKG finding consistent with ischemic heart disease unless there is documentation of&#xD;
             normal cardiac function (e.g., normal stress test or echocardiogram results).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous research radiation exposure (X-rays, PET scans etc.) that, with the study PET&#xD;
             scans, would exceed annual research limits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pregnancy or breast feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Evidence of brain disease such as stroke, tumor, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, or&#xD;
             any neurodegenerative disease on history or on screening MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to lay on his/her back for long periods, severe claustrophobia, pacemaker,&#xD;
             or other contraindication for MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. More than moderate hypertension, defined as blood pressure greater than or equal to&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Subjects taking medications, other than anti-retroviral drugs, that are known&#xD;
             substrates of P-gp that cannot be safely discontinued for this study. Anti-retroviral&#xD;
             drugs, particularly protease inhibitors such as ritonavir, that are P-gp substrates&#xD;
             are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Note: The rationale for the exclusion criteria for alcohol use is to avoid alcohol-related&#xD;
        cognitive impairment as a confounding factor.&#xD;
