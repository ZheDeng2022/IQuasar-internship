    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure resting energy expenditure, total energy expenditure,&#xD;
      and physical activity in recovering burn children to better understand their relation to&#xD;
      impaired growth and nutritional status; and to measure whole body and muscle protein turnover&#xD;
      during recovery from burn injury to understand their impact on body composition and energy&#xD;
      metabolism. It also aims to look at changes in lean body mass, fat mass, bone mineral density&#xD;
      and bone mineral content during rehabilitation and during early convalescence.&#xD;

      Measures of total and resting energy expenditure, protein turnover, body composition and&#xD;
      other nutritional and outcome-based measures will be made in patients receiving inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitative care for their burn injury. Patients will consist of acutely burned patients&#xD;
      initially admitted to our hospital with burns of 40% of their total body, who have recently&#xD;
      recovered from their acute phase of injury and have achieved wound closure as defined by less&#xD;
      than 5% open wound area (Group A). In addition, patients admitted to the hospital for &quot;acute&#xD;
      rehabilitation&quot;, which includes patients in need of rehabilitative therapy will also be&#xD;
      included. This latter group (Group B) is unique in that the patients may have open wound&#xD;
      areas remaining due to difficulty healing, however are not critically ill. Group B may differ&#xD;
      from the typical rehabilitation population seen at our hospital because of their open wounds&#xD;
      and because they received care for their initial injury elsewhere. They are included here due&#xD;
      to their apparent nutritional compromise and their unique energy and protein requirements&#xD;
      that are difficult to predict according to our clinical experience. These patients are most&#xD;
      likely to require artificial nutrition support and will benefit from information gained by&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be made at baseline as defined at the time of wound closure (or at the time&#xD;
      of admission for Group B). Subsequent measures will be done as follows: 1) total energy&#xD;
      expenditure will be assessed weeks 1-3 and again at weeks 7-9. During weeks 1 and 7, protein&#xD;
      turnover studies will take place. Indirect calorimetry and physical activity measures will&#xD;
      take place on 2 consecutive days during each week. Lean body mass measurements will be done&#xD;
      at the time of wound closure and at discharge. The study will end at the time of discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting and total energy expenditure will be done using indirect calorimetry for resting&#xD;
      energy expenditure and the doubly labeled water method for total energy expenditure. Briefly,&#xD;
      the methodology for doubly labeled water is as follows. Two pre-dose urine specimens will be&#xD;
      collected prior to an oral dose containing 0.22 g/kg total body water of 100% 18O water (or&#xD;
      1.2 g/kg per body weight of 10% 18O water) and 0.11 g/kg per body weight of 99.9% deuterium&#xD;
      oxide. Three post-dose urine voids will be collected, followed by collection of a morning&#xD;
      urine void daily for 7 days. Total energy expenditure by this method will represent the&#xD;
      average energy expenditure over a 21-day period. It will be obtained at weeks 1-3 and again&#xD;
      at weeks 7-9 weeks during the rehabilitative phase. Resting energy expenditure will be&#xD;
      determined using indirect calorimetry by a metabolic cart on 2 consecutive days of each week.&#xD;
      Physical activity will be determined by having the patients wear an physical activity monitor&#xD;
      (Actical Physical Monitoring System, mini-Mitter, Co., Inc, Bend Oregon) on their wrist,&#xD;
      ankle or hand for the entire day twice a week (corresponding to the metabolic cart&#xD;
      measurement). This will be worn on 2 days of each week. Protein nutritional status and&#xD;
      turnover will be measured using N15 glycine. Three methyl-histidine will be measured at the&#xD;
      time of N15 glycine studies (weeks 1 and 7) to assess the contribution of muscle mass to&#xD;
      protein turnover. On the day of tracer study, each patient will provide a urine sample, and&#xD;
      this urine sample will be collected to determine the basal level of N15 enrichment in urea&#xD;
      and ammonia. Then the patient will receive a single dose (4mg/kg, less than 2% of normal&#xD;
      daily intake of 1.1g per person) of 15N glycine tracer. For this, patients will drink a dose&#xD;
      of 15N glycine (4mg.kg 1dissolved in 20 ml of saline) mixed in 50 cc of apple juice or other&#xD;
      liquid beverage, followed by a 50 cc wash of water. 24 hour urine collection will commence&#xD;
      immediately. Twenty-four hour urines will be used for determining the 15N NH3 and 15N urea&#xD;
      enrichment. Each urine container will contain 5 ml of 15N HCl for trapping the urinary&#xD;
      ammonium. Urine will be collected each day for 3 days, for determination of the total urinary&#xD;
      nitrogen, urea creatinine, and ammonia excretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lean body mass, fat mass and bone mineral density and content will be determined at baseline&#xD;
      (or at the time of wound closure- as is routine care) and at discharge. Body composition&#xD;
      components (lean body mass, fat mass and bone mineral density) will be determined for the&#xD;
      lumbar spine and the whole body using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) with a Discovery&#xD;
      QDR 4500 A (Hologic, Waltham, MA) in burned and healthy children. Scanning will be performed&#xD;
      by study staff trained and certified in the use of DXA. DXA uses x-ray beams at two photon&#xD;
      energies to estimate body composition. Prior to the scan, height will be measured at the time&#xD;
      of each measurement session with the subjects standing barefoot and in light clothing using a&#xD;
      stadiometer. Measures will be recorded to the nearest 0.5 centimeters respectively. Weight&#xD;
      will be taken using a balance scale and recorded to the nearest 0.5 kilograms. DXA&#xD;
      measurements will be done by having the patient lie flat on his or her back on the DXA&#xD;
      scanning table. Subjects will be positioned by the scanner so that the spine is straight on&#xD;
      the table pad. For the lumbar spine measurement, a knee positioner will be placed under the&#xD;
      patient's lower legs so that the patient's knees and hip are at a 90 degree angle. To align&#xD;
      the C-arm (scanning arm ) of the DXA, a laser line will be positioned 1-2 inches below the&#xD;
      patient's ileac crest, centered around the patient's midline. The scan time approximates 10&#xD;
      seconds, exposure is 0.38 mRem. For the whole body scan, the subject will lay on his or her&#xD;
      back with their body straight, arms at sides, palms down, separated from thighs. The scanner&#xD;
      will rotate the subject's legs inward 25 degrees until the toes touch, using tape around the&#xD;
      feet to maintain this position. The subject will be instructed to breathe normally. The total&#xD;
      scan time approximates 2.5 to 3.5 minutes with an exposure of 0.26 mRem. Total body fat and&#xD;
      lean body mass will be determined by the DEXA as described as part of the whole body bone&#xD;
      mineral density scan (only 1 scan session required). Measures of % body fat content and %&#xD;
      lean body mass content for the whole body will be obtained using the DEXA software. These&#xD;
      values will be compared to age and sex matched pediatric reference data for body composition&#xD;
      {{217 Ellis, K.J. 2000; }}.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because measures of LBM can be confounded by hydration status, a second measure of LBM using&#xD;
      bioelectrical impedance will be made at these points and compared.&#xD;
