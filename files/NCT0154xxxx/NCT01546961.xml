    <textblock>
      For the treatment of P.vivax the standard treatment is chloroquine. There is a growing body&#xD;
      of evidence suggesting that pregnant women may require different doses of drugs, including&#xD;
      antimalarials due to the physiological changes of pregnancy. It is important that any drug&#xD;
      used in pregnant women it is given at the correct dose. The only way to evaluate this is by&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies. The investigators propose to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      chloroquine when use to treat P.vivax in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The same&#xD;
      evaluation in the same woman post-partum is required as a control.&#xD;

      For the treatment of P.vivax the standard treatment is chloroquine. There is a growing body&#xD;
      of evidence suggesting that pregnant women may require different doses of drugs, including&#xD;
      antimalarials, due to the physiological changes of pregnancy. It is important that any drug&#xD;
      used in pregnant women is given at the correct dose. The only way to evaluate this is by&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies. We propose to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of chloroquine when use&#xD;
      to treat P.vivax in the 2nd or 3rd trimester of pregnancy. The same evaluation in the same&#xD;
      woman post-partum is required as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two most recent pharmacokinetic publications conclude differently on chloroquine dosing&#xD;
      in pregnant women: one suggests no dose adjustment and the other that a higher dose is&#xD;
      probably needed. It is crucial that pregnant women are dosed correctly to maximise cure and&#xD;
      minimize the chance for recurrence and the harmful effects of malaria. The proposed study on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics of chloroquine treatment in pregnant women will solve this dilemma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant women on the Thai-Burmese border are encouraged to attend antenatal care often for&#xD;
      early detection and treatment of malaria. Low birth weight due to P.vivax affects&#xD;
      primigravida and multigravida, not just primarily primigravida as with&#xD;
      P.falciparum(highlighted in the attached reference). Hence it is important to consider these&#xD;
      women for radical cure. This is not possible during pregnancy as primaquine is&#xD;
      contraindicated so the next best time is in the post-partum period. During the post-partum&#xD;
      period the woman remains in close contact with midwives for infant care and for their&#xD;
      personal health. The midwives also have a record of malaria attacks during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know more about chloroquine than any other antimalarial used in pregnancy. It has been&#xD;
      widely used for prevention and treatment of malaria in pregnancy and in women with autoimmune&#xD;
      disease such systemic lupus and rheumatoid arthritis high doses of hydroxychloroquine have&#xD;
      been given daily including during the first trimester of pregnancy. Although data from&#xD;
      prospective clinical trials of malaria are limited, this drug is considered safe in all&#xD;
      trimester of pregnancy and in lactation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For treatment of uncomplicated P.vivax WHO recommends chloroquine and primaquine where&#xD;
      P.vivax remains chloroquine sensitive. A 14 day course of primaquine is recommended for&#xD;
      radical cure of P.vivax. WHO advises not to use primaquine during pregnancy or in severe&#xD;
      G6PD. WHO permits the use of primaquine during lactation if the breast fed infant is not G6PD&#xD;
      deficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possibility that women with recurrent P.vivax in the same pregnancy may have chloroquine&#xD;
      resistant P.vivax needs to be considered. While the combination of chloroquine and primaquine&#xD;
      cannot be used in pregnancy and the safety and efficacy of ACTs are still undergoing&#xD;
      evaluation we need to explore alternatives to chloroquine for such cases. ACTs are&#xD;
      recommended for chloroquine resistant P.vivax by WHO and one ACT considered safe in pregnancy&#xD;
      and lactation is a 7 day course of artesunate-clindamycin.&#xD;
