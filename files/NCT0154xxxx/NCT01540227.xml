  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Syphilis is a sexually transmitted infection that causes genital sores and rash, but in some&#xD;
      circumstances may result in more severe and unexpected symptoms. These severe symptoms could&#xD;
      include eye infections, meningitis (infection of the membranes covering the brain and spinal&#xD;
      cord), and liver infection. If not properly treated, syphilis can also lead to heart problems&#xD;
      and dementia (a decline in reasoning, memory and other mental abilities) years down the road.&#xD;
      There has been an increase in the number of reported cases of syphilis in North America,&#xD;
      Europe, and Australia over the past decade. The number of new syphilis infections in Canada&#xD;
      has increased roughly 10-fold over the past 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 1943, the antibiotic penicillin has been used to treat syphilis; however, very little&#xD;
      information has been gathered to determine the proper dose of penicillin or appropriate&#xD;
      duration of treatment. Added to this, several studies have shown that the recommended dose of&#xD;
      penicillin fails to cure syphilis in 20-30% of patients. Since the number of people infected&#xD;
      with syphilis is increasing, and since syphilis has the potential to cause serious disease,&#xD;
      the investigators need better information on how to treat syphilis effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to determine whether the current dose of penicillin recommended to treat&#xD;
      syphilis is sufficient to cure the infection. Specifically the investigators will try to&#xD;
      determine whether the amount of penicillin in your blood 3 and 7 days after receiving&#xD;
      treatment for syphilis is sufficient to cure the infection as demonstrated by a blood test 6&#xD;
      or 12 months from now. This study is a multi-centered trial based in Ottawa but with centers&#xD;
      recruiting both in Montreal and Toronto. A total of 120 participants with syphilis will be&#xD;
      recruited into this study. The treatment you will receive for syphilis in this study does not&#xD;
      differ from that you would receive normally; the investigators are only observing the levels&#xD;
      of penicillin in your blood and relating them with the outcome of treatment.&#xD;
