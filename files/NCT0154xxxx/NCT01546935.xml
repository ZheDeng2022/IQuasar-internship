  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no treatment for children less than one year of age with influenza&#xD;
      related lower respiratory tract infection that is either considered standard or registered in&#xD;
      any country. This dismal scenario exists even though influenza related LRTI is a significant&#xD;
      illness causing morbidity and mortality, especially in children less than 6 months of age.&#xD;
      Avian influenza has been reported rarely in children less than one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no data in Vietnam and very few data in Thailand on the burden of influenza in&#xD;
      children less than one. This young age group suffers high mortality. Oseltamivir may be&#xD;
      beneficial in such children. This is basis of this trial.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are limited data from Thailand on the aetiology of LRTI but no data on mortality of&#xD;
      hospitalised children. Thai children &lt; 1 year accounted for circa one third of LRTIs in&#xD;
      children who were treated as out or inpatients in whom influenza was isolated in 6 (2.7%) of&#xD;
      271 children and RSV in 44 (20%). At the Queen Sirikit hospital, Bangkok, influenza A and B&#xD;
      and RSV accounted for approximately 11% (9/80), 2.5% (2/80) and 6% (5/80) of children &lt; 1&#xD;
      year, respectively. This study included children with underlying diseases like congenital&#xD;
      heart disease and chronic lung disease. A small laboratory series of 110 children at Siriraj&#xD;
      hospital with LRTIs infections (Pilaipan Puthavathana, personal communication) identified RSV&#xD;
      A/B (17%), metapneumovirus (14%), parainfluenza 1 (12%) and adenovirus (12%), influenza B&#xD;
      (6%), influenza A (4%), coronaviruses (3%), Parainfluenza 3 (2%) and 2 (0%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of drugs registered for treating influenza is limited to oral Oseltamivir,&#xD;
      amantadine and rimantadine and inhaled zanamivir. As a result of the 2009 influenza A/H1N1,&#xD;
      clinical guidelines have been updated to include children less than one years old . However,&#xD;
      regulatory studies of oseltamivir excluded children under 1 year based on preclinical data in&#xD;
      rats in which there were deaths in young rats (7 days old) but none in 14 days old rats given&#xD;
      large doses of Oseltamivir. Higher concentrations of Oseltamivir were found in the brains of&#xD;
      the younger rats which was thought to be due immaturity of the blood brain barrier.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is, however, some clinical experience with Oseltamivir in the under ones from Japan,&#xD;
      Thailand, Germany , the USA , and additional experience with 2009 pH1N1 . The doses used were&#xD;
      2 mg/kg bid which is consistent with the dose recommended in the UK for children who weigh&#xD;
      less than 15 kg (30 mg bid for 5 days). At the Queen Sirikit hospital, Oseltamivir has been&#xD;
      given to a very small number of children &lt; 1 year with severe influenza with good effect (T.&#xD;
      Chotpitayasunondh, unpublished observations). This experience is similar to that of others&#xD;
      i.e. good clinical outcomes and apparently good tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An Oseltamivir pharmacokinetic study in children age 1-5 years showed that the dose of 2&#xD;
      mg/kg resulted in plasma-concentration time curves (AUC) similar to the AUC accepted in&#xD;
      adult. However, the younger the child, the lower the AUC level; never the less, there are&#xD;
      still insufficient pharmacokinetics data in children under one year .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical significance of reduced in vitro sensitivity is unclear owing to the paucity of&#xD;
      human data but these mutations are likely to result in reduced antiviral efficacy of&#xD;
      Oseltamivir and the adamantanes against H1N1. Furthermore, amantadine treatment of influenza&#xD;
      frequently results in the rapid development of amantadine resistance in both H1N1 and H2N3&#xD;
      viruses, resulting in continued virus replication, thus, making this drug less than ideal for&#xD;
      treating influenza. Currently, there is limited adamantane resistant H1N1 but widespread&#xD;
      adamantane resistant in H3N2. H3N2 and influenza B remain sensitive to Oseltamivir. The&#xD;
      adamantanes have no activity against influenza B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergence of resistance poses difficulties for the treatment of influenza in children&#xD;
      less than one but oseltamivir represents at present the optimal choice for treating such&#xD;
      children. Therefore, this protocol will assess the effect of oral Oseltamivir at doses&#xD;
      recommended by the WHO to see if they are applicable to Thai children.&#xD;
