  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to assess, using Mohs micrographic surgery (MMS) at&#xD;
      the end of treatment, the efficacy (primary) and safety (secondary) of vismodegib compared to&#xD;
      placebo in the oral adjunctive pre surgical treatment of basal cell carcinoma. A secondary&#xD;
      objective is to assess how often and in what types of lesions does pre surgical treatment&#xD;
      with vismodegib result in complete eradication of the tumor.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common cutaneous malignancy. In the United States&#xD;
      alone, the incidence of these tumors approaches or exceeds one million cases each year, and&#xD;
      continues to increase. Actinic damage is the primary causal factor, and 85% of all lesions&#xD;
      are located in cosmetically-sensitive areas such as the face, head, and neck. Although these&#xD;
      tumors do not usually metastasize, their high prevalence and morbidity have established them&#xD;
      as a significant public health problem. In addition a small percentage can cause significant&#xD;
      morbidity or mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment goals for BCC focus on complete tumor removal and minimization of cosmetic and&#xD;
      functional defects. Among the multiple therapeutic options available, including both&#xD;
      excisional and ablative approaches, MMS is the most definitive treatment modality. MMS&#xD;
      involves excision of the clinically apparent neoplastic lesion, processing and staining of&#xD;
      horizontal frozen sections, stepwise microscopic analysis, meticulous mapping, and&#xD;
      re-excision of residual neoplasm until tumor-free margins are obtained. Unlike all other&#xD;
      excisional techniques, MMS allows visualization of the entire surgical margin, thus ensuring&#xD;
      complete removal of the lesion while maximally preserving the surrounding normal skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unfortunately, because many tumors show significant sub clinical extension, the resulting&#xD;
      surgical defect after completion of MMS can be significantly larger than the presenting&#xD;
      lesion, often necessitating complex, costly, and time-consuming repairs, and compromising the&#xD;
      final cosmetic appearance or function. In addition, tumors in low-risk locations, which&#xD;
      typically undergo simple excisions, nonetheless can require significant circumferential&#xD;
      margins of normal tissue to ensure complete removal, again impacting cosmesis, function and&#xD;
      or cost. Likewise, aggressive tumors such as sclerosing/morpheaform or recurrent BCC's can&#xD;
      result in significant post surgical defects and associated morbidity and decreased function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presently, the treatment of BCC, whether by excisional or ablative means, incurs an estimated&#xD;
      annual cost in excess of $600 million. An effective oral agent for the treatment of BCC could&#xD;
      serve as an adjunct modality in the removal of primary or recurrent lesions and may be&#xD;
      expected to significantly decrease cosmetic disfigurement as well as reduce&#xD;
      treatment-associated costs. In fact, studies such as this one may ultimately show that oral&#xD;
      treatment results in complete elimination of selected neoplastic lesions, thereby eliminating&#xD;
      altogether the need for surgery in some lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vismodegib, (GDC-0449) is an orally delivered small molecule hedgehog pathway inhibitor. In&#xD;
      tumor growth Hedgehog binding to PCTH1 (Patched) stops PCTH1 from inhibiting SMO (smoothened)&#xD;
      signaling. In the absence of PCTH1 (e.g. loss of PCTH1 mutations) SMO signaling occurs&#xD;
      constitutively, stimulating GLI1 (Glioma-Associated Oncogene-1) thus promoting tumor growth.&#xD;
      Vismodegib inhibits SMO signaling through direct interaction with SMO thus preventing the&#xD;
      activation of GLI1 and thus inhibiting tumor growth in Basal Cell Carcinomas. The&#xD;
      investigators anticipate our study to demonstrate the feasibility, efficacy, and safety of&#xD;
      Vismodegib in the oral treatment of BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety, preliminary efficacy, and pharmacokinetics of Vismodegib was assessed in an&#xD;
      open-label, multicenter, two-stage Phase I trial1. Patients had solid tumors refractory to&#xD;
      therapy. An expansion cohort was included for patients with locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      BCC (n=33). Patients received continuous administration of Vismodegib at 150 mg/day (n=17),&#xD;
      270 mg/day (n=15), or 540 mg/day (n=1) beginning on Day 1. Patients were treated until&#xD;
      disease progression, intolerable toxicities, or withdrawal from the study. Response&#xD;
      assessments for radiologically measurable disease, RECIST version 1.0 was used. CR or PR&#xD;
      determined on 2 consecutive occasions â‰¥4 weeks apart. Locally advanced tumors assessed on&#xD;
      Dermatological Examination. CR defined as disappearance of a palpable or visible tumor; PR&#xD;
      defined as a reduction of &gt;50% in tumor diameter. Results from this pilot study demonstrated&#xD;
      that oral vismodegib could clear or reduce the tumor burden of BCCs with a CR in 2, PR in 16,&#xD;
      SD in 11 and PD in 4 in patients followed over a 20 month period. No dose-limiting toxic&#xD;
      events or grade 5 events were observed with a single grade 4 adverse event (asymptomatic&#xD;
      hyponatremia) reported. The more significant and frequent adverse events were GI related with&#xD;
      dysgeusia and muscle spasm reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, one Phase II single-arm, non-randomized trial of single-agent vismodegib at 150&#xD;
      mg/day to progression or intolerance with 104 patients enrolled: (33 mBCC, 71 LA BCC) using&#xD;
      the primary endpoint: Independent Review Facility (IRF) assessed overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      and the secondary endpoints: Investigator-assessed ORR, progression-free survival (PFS),&#xD;
      overall survival (OS), duration of response, and safety was also recently completed and it&#xD;
      was announced that the study met its primary endpoint (ORR) and showed shrinkage of tumors in&#xD;
      a pre-defined percentage of patients2. A preliminary safety assessment showed the most common&#xD;
      adverse events were consistent with previous experience with vismodegib. The most common&#xD;
      adverse events were muscle spasms, hair loss, altered taste sensation, weight loss, fatigue,&#xD;
      nausea, decreased appetite and diarrhea. A detailed safety assessment is ongoing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since these are slow-growing tumors which are expected to respond favorably to treatment, and&#xD;
      since all lesions will be surgically excised by MMS within 6 months of initial consultation,&#xD;
      this study will not affect the current standard of care in the management of BCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After target tumor site is identified guided by either the plastic template or tattoo&#xD;
      performed pre treatment the original lesion will be delineated using the template and&#xD;
      concentric circles of two millimeters drawn around the central target area. A punch biopsy of&#xD;
      the center of the lesion will then be performed and thereafter the lesion will be excised&#xD;
      using standard Mohs procedures, with the excised tissue evaluated histologically to confirm&#xD;
      the presence or absence of tumor. If there is residual tumor found histologically or there is&#xD;
      scarring or there is significant inflammation present histologically additional layers will&#xD;
      be performed using the 2mm concentric circles as a guide until all tumor is deemed to have&#xD;
      been removed. The final wound size at the completion of Mohs surgery (i.e., upon reaching&#xD;
      tumor-free tissue margins) will then be determined using the pre-treatment concentric&#xD;
      margins, and compared to the lesion size at the initiation of treatment both for treatment&#xD;
      and placebo areas. In addition, the histological extent of the lesion will be compared to the&#xD;
      expected sub clinical extension as documented by Wolf and Zitelli as previously noted. Any&#xD;
      subject who discontinued treatment prematurely should be encouraged to return to the clinic&#xD;
      for the excision. Only subjects who have no histological evidence of BCC will be considered&#xD;
      complete responders. Note that post excision antibiotics and analgesics administered to the&#xD;
      subject prophylactically for infection and pain at the excision site must be recorded on the&#xD;
      concomitant medication page of the CRF.&#xD;
