  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Abdominoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in plastic surgery. The&#xD;
      appearance of the scar is a major factor contributing to the aesthetic outcome of the&#xD;
      procedure and depends largely on the technique of wound closure. The investigators routinely&#xD;
      used resorbable subcutaneous sutures and resorbable intracutaneous sutures for this closure.&#xD;
      To overcome the potential detrimental effects of sutures in skin closure, surgical adhesives&#xD;
      were introduced as a new technology. The new PrineoTM wound closure system was created to&#xD;
      combine the effectiveness of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate (Dermabond TM) together with a&#xD;
      self-adhering mesh to make closure of long skin incisions even more safe and reliable.&#xD;
      PrineoTM has the potential to offer a patient several benefits over traditional wound closure&#xD;
      with sutures.A patient treated with Prineoâ„¢ can shower immediately following a procedure&#xD;
      because the product forms a watertight barrier over the incision. PrineoTM can be easily&#xD;
      removed, often with less pain than is sometimes associated with suture removal, after the&#xD;
      natural wound healing process is complete (approximately 12 to 25 days). Other benefits are&#xD;
      that it forms a microbial barrier and provides even distribution of tension across the length&#xD;
      of the incision to ensure wound edge approximation throughout the wound healing process.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it reduces subcuticular closure time as compared to subcuticular suturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, these potential advantages have not been proven until now, as the methods used to&#xD;
      assess the aesthetic outcome were not reproducible in most assessments, and none of these&#xD;
      studies assessed patient satisfaction.1-3 Moreover, none was performed in a plastic surgical&#xD;
      patient population. For these reasons, the investigators prospectively studied the results of&#xD;
      wound closure after abdominoplasty with randomized use of PrineoTM and conventional suturing&#xD;
      to assess the possible difference in outcome between these two methods.&#xD;

      Abdominoplasty is one of the most commonly performed procedures in plastic surgery. The&#xD;
      appearance of the scar is a major factor contributing to the aesthetic outcome of the&#xD;
      procedure and depends largely on the technique of wound closure. The new PrineoTM wound&#xD;
      closure system was introduced to combine the effectiveness of 2-octyl-cyanoacrylate&#xD;
      (Dermabond TM) together with a self-adhering mesh.Fifty-two women and 8 men aged between 21&#xD;
      and 65 years scheduled for abdominoplasty were included in the study. Two weeks&#xD;
      postoperatively, the wounds were examined and graded according to the Hollander Cosmesis&#xD;
      Scale. At 3- and 6-month follow-up, the aesthetic outcome of the abdominal scar was evaluated&#xD;
      with the Vancouver Scar Scale. Six months postoperatively, the patients were further asked to&#xD;
      score their part of the Patient Scar Assessment Scale.The Hollander Cosmesis Scale indicated&#xD;
      a significantly more favourable overall result with PrineoTM at 2 weeks after surgery. The&#xD;
      Vancouver Scar Scale demonstrated a better cosmetic outcome in favour of PrineoTM 3 and 6&#xD;
      months after surgery The Patient Scar Assessment Scale scores 6 months after surgery&#xD;
      indicated that the patients noted significantly less pain, thickness and irregularity with&#xD;
      PrineoTM.Based on the investigators results, the investigators conclude that PrineoTM is a&#xD;
      safe and effective substitute for superficial skin closure, with good cosmetic results and no&#xD;
      increase in wound complications. The use of PrineoTM decreases operative times and enhances&#xD;
      patients' postoperative comfort&#xD;
