  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This open-label, Phase 1 study will investigate the 5-hydroxytryptamine 6 (5-HT6) receptor&#xD;
      occupancy in the brain using positron emission tomography (PET) following single oral doses&#xD;
      of SLV354. Up to 22 healthy male subjects and male subjects with stable schizophrenia,&#xD;
      between 18-55 years of age are to complete the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an exploratory, open-label PET study designed to examine the relationship between&#xD;
      SLV354 plasma concentration and 5-HT6 receptor occupancy in the brain following single oral&#xD;
      doses of SLV354 in healthy male subjects and male subjects with stable schizophrenia. A total&#xD;
      of up to 22 subjects are to complete the study, including approximately 12 subjects with&#xD;
      schizophrenia on a stable dose of an atypical antipsychotic medication. Within 60 days prior&#xD;
      to the PET scan, subjects will be screened based on medical history, physical examination,&#xD;
      vital signs, ECG, clinical laboratory tests, response to Columbia-Suicide-Severity Rating&#xD;
      Scale (C-SSRS) and for schizophrenia subjects only, the diagnosis of schizophrenia based on&#xD;
      Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-Fourth Edition-Text Revision&#xD;
      (DSM-IV-TR). Following Screening, eligible subjects will have a Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) scan, unless one was performed within one year of the PET scan, to delineate the region&#xD;
      of interest for the individual PET images. The radiotracer [11C]-QUICS will be used for the&#xD;
      PET scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive a single oral dose of SLV354. Healthy subjects will have one PET&#xD;
      scan prior to and two PET scans after administration of SLV354. Schizophrenia subjects will&#xD;
      have two PET scans prior to and one PET scan after administration of SLV354.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of a metal implant that would preclude a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
             scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Radiation exposure for research purposes within the past year that will exclude&#xD;
             participation in the study.&#xD;
