      3. INVESTIGATION PLAN 3.1 Study Design and Plan This study is a double-blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, randomized Parallel-group trial. Guang'anmen Hospital is the sponsor and&#xD;
      has designed the clinical trial protocol. No.303 Hospital of Chinese People's Liberation Army&#xD;
      (PLA) is the collaborator, where the most patients come from.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Random Method Using the randomized block design，stratifying by α-Thalassemia and&#xD;
      β-Thalassemia, the patients will be allocated randomly 1:1 to Yisui Shengxue Granules group&#xD;
      or placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic Analysis System (SAS, SAS institute, Cary, NC, USA) was used to produce 001~120&#xD;
      random code, matching 120 subjects who divided randomly 1:1 into Yisui Shengxue Granules&#xD;
      group and placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Blinding Design 3.3.1 Packaging of the study drug and placebo: all drugs including&#xD;
      medical emergency envelops must be repackaged and reallocated according to regulations of&#xD;
      standard double-blind clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3.2．Blinding The encoded data will be kept in Guang'anmen Hospital, China Academy of&#xD;
      Chinese Medical Sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When all patients fulfill the procedures of the trial, the data will be entered into&#xD;
      electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs) and locked, and then the blind will be disclosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If unmasking is necessary because of a serious, unexpected and related adverse event or if a&#xD;
      medical emergency occurs which requires knowledge of the exact therapy, the investigator may&#xD;
      contact the principal investigator or censor to determine whether the medical emergency&#xD;
      envelop will be broken. The date and reason of the code breaking must be documented and&#xD;
      signed and this information must be sent to the sponsor and collaborator. The patient should&#xD;
      be withdrawn from Study Medication but be followed up according to the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If twenty percent medical emergency envelops are broken or blinding method is betrayed, this&#xD;
      trial will be fail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Sample Size Estimation A total of 120 patients will be required (α-Thalassemia: 80,&#xD;
      β-Thalassemia: 40 ), assuming a relative risk of sample loss (no more than 20%) in the whole&#xD;
      trial-- an accrual period of 3 months treatment and a minimum 3 months follow up. The numbers&#xD;
      of patients in both study drug group and placebo group are equal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6 Removal of Patients from Study 4.6.1 Investigators make the decision of patients'&#xD;
      withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will decide to withdraw the patients if they have following conditions in the&#xD;
      middle of the trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Upper respiratory tract infection with temperature higher than 38.5℃. This condition&#xD;
           will lead to hemolysis aggravation and hemoglobin level decreasing, affecting the&#xD;
           evaluation of therapeutic effects. The patients will be regarded as invalid cases once&#xD;
           they withdraw from the trial and accept other therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Anemia complications or physiological changes make the patients being unsuitable to&#xD;
           continue in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients, with poor compliance, take the Study Medication less than 80% or more than&#xD;
           120%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unblinding cases and unmasking cases because of medical emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Taking prohibited drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Refusing to take any Study Medication. 4.6.2 Patients make the decision of their&#xD;
           withdrawal. In accordance with the World Medical Association Declaration of Helsinki&#xD;
           (1996 version), as amended from time to time, all patients have the right to withdraw&#xD;
           from the study at any time and for any reason, without prejudice to his or her future&#xD;
           medical care by the physician or institution, and is not obliged to give his or her&#xD;
           reasons for doing so. Without compromising the right of patients to withdraw from the&#xD;
           trial, every effort will be made to understand and accommodate their concerns and avoid&#xD;
           withdrawal wherever possible. If patients do not fulfill the therapy, tests, or&#xD;
           follow-up for any reason, the patients will be dealt with as removal from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.6.3 The case report forms of withdrawal patients, for whatever reason, must be kept. The&#xD;
      last test results will be dealt with as the terminal results to enter the full analysis set.&#xD;
      If the significant effects are showed up in less than 3 moths, the patients will be&#xD;
      considered as significant effective cases though they complete the trial in advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.7 Termination Criteria Trial termination means the study may be terminated at any time if&#xD;
      the study represents a serious medical risk to the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serious safety risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gross error in the clinical trial protocol or major deviation appears during trial&#xD;
           execution.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sponsor's request (reasons of finance, administration, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.3 The Packaging Boxes and Preservation In a large packaging box, there will be three medium&#xD;
      size packing boxes, containing 3 months dosage of Study Medication for one patient. The Study&#xD;
      Medication can be either Yisui Shengxue Granules or placebo according to the random code,&#xD;
      preserved by specially-assigned person and stored in dry environment at room temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.4 Drugs Assignment, Checking and Return Study Medication will be delivered to each clinical&#xD;
      center according to the Study Medication code that randomly assigned to the clinical center,&#xD;
      and be distributed to patients, who fulfill the inclusion criteria, in the order of drug code&#xD;
      in 3 times. &quot;Drug Used Report&quot; should be filled in timely and kept by drug administrator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators should record the Study Medication quantity that patients received, took, and&#xD;
      returned when they visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.5 Drugs Blinding and Medical Emergency Envelope Study Medication blinding will be made by&#xD;
      the corresponding department according to the randomization list. A medical emergency&#xD;
      envelope, with detailed information of the medication, will be prepared for every&#xD;
      randomization code and be kept in the principal investigator of each clinical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.6 Precautions and Prohibited Drug Combination&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. In this Trial, other drugs for β-Thalassemia are prohibited.&#xD;
&#xD;

      occurrence time, severity, duration, therapeutic measures and clinical outcomes must be&#xD;
      recorded authentically in &quot;DRUG ADVERSE EVENT FORM&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 Severity of the Adverse Event&#xD;
&#xD;
      The severity of adverse events should be graded as follows:&#xD;

      8.3 Relationship to Study Medication 8.3.1 Identification standards&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Whether there is a reasonable relationship between the time of taking Study Medication&#xD;
           and the occurrence of the suspected adverse reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Whether the suspected adverse reactions accord with the adverse reactions known to the&#xD;
           Study Medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Whether the suspected adverse reactions can be interpreted as the results of drugs&#xD;
           combination, patient's clinical condition, or other therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Whether the suspected adverse reactions disappear or are relieved by reducing the Study&#xD;
           Medication dosage or stopping to take.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Whether the suspected adverse reactions occur again at the time of retaking the&#xD;
           suspected drugs? Adverse Reaction Identification Conclusions Items 1 2 3 4 5 Sure + + -&#xD;
           + + Probable + + - + ？ Undetermined + + ± ± ？ Unlikely + - ± ± ？ Unconcerned - - + - -&#xD;
           Note：+ Yes, - No, ± uncertain, ？Information is not available 8.3.2 According to the&#xD;
           above table, the relationship between adverse reaction and Study Medication will be&#xD;
           classified into 5 kinds as following: 1-sure, 2-probable, 3-undetermined, 4-unlikely&#xD;
           5-unconcerned The incidence rate of adverse reactions =（the number of cases with adverse&#xD;
           reactions including kind 1, 2 and 3）/（the number of cases which need to be identified&#xD;
           whether adverse reactions happen） 8.4 Adverse Event Handling 8.4.1 Handling&#xD;
           principle：Any adverse events such as patients' complaints and laboratory abnormality&#xD;
           should be taken seriously and analyzed carefully. Measures for managing adverse&#xD;
           reactions should be taken at once to protect the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.4.2 Handling Procedure：Adverse reactions should be documented in CRF in detail including&#xD;
      rechecking (when it is necessary), duration, prognosis and relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.4.3 Serious Adverse Events Handling&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During the Trial, any serious adverse events must be reported to the clinical center,&#xD;
           sponsor and medical ethics committee and recorded in &quot;DRUG ADVERSE EVENT FORM&quot;. All&#xD;
           clinical centers, principal investigators and the contact person listed on the CFR&#xD;
           should be informed as well at same time. Besides, a serious adverse reaction must be&#xD;
           reported to the State Food and Drug Administration within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measures：If a medical emergency happens to a patient, the corresponding medical&#xD;
           emergency envelop will be broken by the principal investigator of the clinical center in&#xD;
           the presence of two witnesses. Proper management for adverse reactions will be taken and&#xD;
           CRA should be informed the outcomes. Investigators should write down the information&#xD;
           including unblinding reason, date, management and outcomes in CRF and sign their names.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.4.4 Following up Adverse Events Unrelieved Any adverse events should be followed up until&#xD;
      the adverse reactions relief or being stable.&#xD;
