      Abstract Many patients experience serious reduced functional ability after a critical illness&#xD;
      and hospitalization in an Intensive Care Unit. The cause of the reduced functional ability is&#xD;
      the combination of critical illness and immobilization following treatment with a ventilator.&#xD;
      The functional ability of patients can be affected up till a year after the discharge, and&#xD;
      may shows a decrease in ability to walk and in problems with focusing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies show that it is safe and possible to mobilize the patients with for instance bed&#xD;
      bikes, sitting up and standing up, even during ventilator therapy. The effect is shown as&#xD;
      lesser days with delirium, on a ventilator therapy or hospitalization. No study has shown how&#xD;
      early and at which intensity a patient can be mobilized. Our hypothesis is that an early&#xD;
      systematic mobilization improves functional ability of the critically ill patient, mentally,&#xD;
      physically and their life expectancy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate a mobilization&#xD;
      protocol applied at critically ill patients, including a contribute related to knowledge of&#xD;
      how soon and how intense patients ventilated for more than 48 hours can endure mobilization.&#xD;
      To evaluate the connections between functional ability and life expectancy for critically ill&#xD;
      patients are compared to a population matching in age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention project has a multicenter design with pre- and post research related to&#xD;
      effect in early systematic mobilization of critically ill patients. 200 patients are included&#xD;
      in the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are collected at tests showing the functional ability of patients in different ways. The&#xD;
      tests are made at the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit and 5 days after at their wards&#xD;
      and again at 3 and 12 month from discharge when the patients have returned to their home. The&#xD;
      project started in February 2011 and is expected to end in May 2013, findings is expected in&#xD;
      November 2013.&#xD;

      Background Many patients experience serious reduced functional ability in form of physical&#xD;
      and mental problems (1) after a critical illness and prolonged stay at an Intensive Care&#xD;
      Unit. The critical illness entails the need for sedation and mechanical ventilation leading&#xD;
      to immobilization as a consequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of critical illness and immobilization leads to an increased risk of further&#xD;
      muscle deterioration and it is assumed that this condition deteriorates the inflammatory&#xD;
      response (2, 3, 4, 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immobilization is an important contributory cause of reduced functional ability independent&#xD;
      of critical illness. The deterioration is noticed up till a year after the discharge from&#xD;
      hospital (1, 6) and physically it is shown in a reduced ability to walk (1, 6, 7), and&#xD;
      mentally as delirium, associated with increased mortality and an extended period of&#xD;
      hospitalisation. The mentally effects show a deterioration 1 year after the discharge from&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The symptoms appear as difficulty concentrating and evaluated poor health (1, 6, 7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mobilization has a positive effect on the functional ability of patients, physically and&#xD;
      mentally (8, 9, 10, 11, 12) even during mobilizing in connection with wake up calls of&#xD;
      sedated patients 10). The patients experience less fear and dependency, they are in control&#xD;
      to a greater extent (10) and also a significant increase in the ability to walk is shown&#xD;
      (13). The mobilized patients have fewer days of delirium, mechanical ventilation and lesser&#xD;
      days at Intensive Care Units (10, 12). It is possible to mobilize critically ill patients in&#xD;
      bed by means of passive and active exercises. The exercises consist of getting out of bed,&#xD;
      sitting on the edge of the bed, moving from bed to chair, standing on the floor, standing up,&#xD;
      sitting in a chair and walking (10,13,14,15,16), but it is recommended that there is a close&#xD;
      interdisciplinary collaboration between nurse and physiotherapist (17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies (23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28) show that it is safe and possible to mobilize&#xD;
      critically ill patients while they receive mechanical ventilation. The incidence is less than&#xD;
      1 % (22) and is not directly related to age, sex, number of organ failure, co-morbidity or&#xD;
      endo-tracheal tube (10, 21,22,25). The incidences appear as deceased SAT &lt; 80 % (10, 17, 22,&#xD;
      24), subsidence of prostration without sustaining any damage (22), discontinuation of enteral&#xD;
      feeding probe (22) or arterial catheter (10), changes in the systolic pressure (10,21,22), or&#xD;
      patient-ventilator-asynchrony (10). It is recommended that the mobilization is structured&#xD;
      (10, 15, 18, 22) by guidelines or protocols, and that the patients are screened before the&#xD;
      mobilization. It is however not obvious, how soon and how intense patients can endure&#xD;
      mobilizing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that an early systematic mobilization improves the functional ability of&#xD;
      critically ill patients, mentally and physically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To document the effects of early systematic mobilization of critically ill patients -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to evaluate a mobilization protocol applied to critically ill patients, including a&#xD;
           contribute related to knowledge of how soon and how intense patients can endure&#xD;
           mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate connections between functional ability and life expectancy of critically ill&#xD;
           patients compared to a population matching in age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is to measure the functional ability of the patients related to&#xD;
      systematic mobilization. The patients stamina, balance, strength, experience and sense of&#xD;
      control and emotional energy in relation to social contact is also measured. Correlation&#xD;
      between functional ability and life expectancy is measured through their own judgment in&#xD;
      relation to their physical level of activity, before hospitalisation and after discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome is to measure mortality, days with mechanical ventilation, number of&#xD;
      days of delirium, and bed rest at the Intensive Care Units and in the hospital, and factors&#xD;
      contributing to critical illness which could influence the patients ability to recover&#xD;
      (viewed as mobilization) are also measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention project has a multicenter design with pre- and post research related to the&#xD;
      effect of early systematic mobilization of critically ill patients (29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention and data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research is divided in 3 phases: An 8 month observation phase, a 2 month implementation&#xD;
      phase and an 8 month intervention phase. The effect is measured as the difference in the&#xD;
      functional level between the observation phase and the intervention phase related to primary&#xD;
      and secondary outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Observation phase The patients are mobilized according to the present routine of the&#xD;
      hospital units without any guidelines. Data is registered on &quot;the observation form&quot; (exh1),&#xD;
      and collected in the light of the present routine of the units. Before the form is used, the&#xD;
      staff is instructed verbally and in writing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-observer variation is measured and tested at 8 nurses and by Kappa statistic.&#xD;
      Acceptable values of Kappa are 0.61-0.80 corresponding to a high level of agreement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 implementation phase The mobilization protocol (exh 2) is formulated, inspired by&#xD;
      Perme (15) and Gosselink (28) and in collaboration with physiotherapists at Slagelse&#xD;
      Hospital, as a support for the staff during early systematic training. In order to strengthen&#xD;
      the project, the staff is involved in the process early, when the mobilization protocol is&#xD;
      used (31, 32). In both units there are established &quot;steering groups&quot; before the protocol is&#xD;
      made. The staff is introduced to the protocol in this phase, and it is expected that the&#xD;
      implementation is finished within a period of two month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3 intervention phase The patients are mobilized according to the mobilization protocol.&#xD;
      The training consists of improving the balance, muscle strength and stamina. Before the&#xD;
      mobilization the abilities of the patients are evaluated according to contradictions and&#xD;
      prescreening (exh 2, 3). The primary nurse and the physiotherapist evaluate and allocate&#xD;
      patients to the best possible mobilization stage. All patients are mobilized minimum 3 times&#xD;
      a day (exh 2) and the have the support of two persons as a minimum. Before each activity the&#xD;
      patient must have a rest period of ½ hour. The security of the patients during mobilization&#xD;
      is registered (exh 1, 3). The mobilization stops if the security is affected. During walks&#xD;
      patients are followed by a member of staff pushing a chair behind them, in order to prevent&#xD;
      or cushion a fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 patients will be included in the observation phase of this project, and another 100 in&#xD;
      the intervention phase, according to the following criteria: Patients hospitalized in Unit&#xD;
      4141, at Rigshospitalet or ICU at Slagelse, who have been intubated for more than 48 hours,&#xD;
      age ≥18, and after positive confirmation from relatives that the patient before the&#xD;
      hospitalization was able to read and understand instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with a terminal illness, users of wheelchairs, patients with a known cognitive&#xD;
      disturbance, open thorax, ECMO, VAD, IABP, and patients where mobilization is contradicted,&#xD;
      and finally patients living outside Sjaelland, Lolland and Falster.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients vary from being totally dependent of help towards an alteration of independence and&#xD;
      this requires a method to measure which can detect the shift in their functional ability&#xD;
      during hospitalization and after discharge from the hospital. No single method of measurement&#xD;
      detects this shift per se and it is therefore necessary to use various methods to measure the&#xD;
      functional ability of the patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appraisal of the mental ability of patients, understood as consciousness is evaluated&#xD;
      daily with RASS score, and delirium through CAM ICU (exh 1, 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge the patients evaluate their own functional ability, understood as control and&#xD;
      emotional energy related to social contact with other human beings, in the questionnaire SF&#xD;
      36 (exh 4). All 3 measurements are validated in a number of International and Danish projects&#xD;
      and are therefore regarded as suitable for critically ill patients (34, 35) The appraisal of&#xD;
      the functional ability of patients, understood as the capability to mobilize during&#xD;
      hospitalization is &quot;the Cumulated Ambulation Score&quot; (CAS). CAS shows the independency and&#xD;
      development of the patients regarding the basic mobility in days, understood as capability to&#xD;
      get out of bed, to stand, to sit and to walk (exh 1, 3). CAS, which originally was validated&#xD;
      for patients with hip fractures, has been recommended for a broader group of patients (36).&#xD;
      Pain is evaluated through a numeric rang scale (NRS) (37) before mobilization (exh 1, 3). In&#xD;
      addition the varying forms of mobilization like standing up, sitting down, walking and also&#xD;
      accidents are registered (exh 1,3) At discharge from the ICU to a ward or their own home, the&#xD;
      development in functional ability is registered by means of ADL, Bartel-20 (exh 5). ADL&#xD;
      registration shows the ability of patients to fulfill daily living, Bartel-20 clarifies the&#xD;
      functional ability in 10 selected areas (38, 39) and is validated both internationally and in&#xD;
      Denmark (40). In order to follow the development of the physical strength, endurance and&#xD;
      balance the &quot;Rejse Sætte Sig&quot; test is used (exh 6) and also &quot;Timed Up and Go&quot; (TUG) (exh 7).&#xD;
      The test &quot;Rejse Sætte Sig &quot; clarifies the level of strength in the lower part of their&#xD;
      bodies, their balance and risk of falling. The TUG test is recommended to predict the&#xD;
      physical strength and balance of patients who are neither self-reliant nor totally dependent&#xD;
      (41).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shift in the ability of patients to be self-reliant at home is evaluated in &quot;New Mobility&#xD;
      Score&quot; (exh 8). The test which clarifies the ability to be self-reliant at home shows an&#xD;
      acceptable reliability score (42, 43, 44).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure connections between the functional ability and life expectancy matched to&#xD;
      the Danish population and correlating in age &quot;Fysisk Aktivitet i Fritiden&quot; is used (exh 9).&#xD;
      The score which clarifies the physical activities is also recommended to clarify the risk of&#xD;
      dependency and death (45).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to estimate the outcome of critically ill patients Apache and SAPS are used. Both&#xD;
      are validated for critically ill patients (46, 47).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistic Calculation of strength is done based on previous studies and the key parameters&#xD;
      are walking distance in meter and ADL measured in bartel-20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation for ADL Interval scale Type 1 errors: 5% Est.SD:43 The least&#xD;
      difference between mean: 20,00 Type 2 errors: 20% Patients needed both group: 72 Sample size&#xD;

      The least difference between mean: 10, 00 Type 2 errors: 20% Patients needed both group: 62&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are registered in Excel, processed in SPSS and statistically compared X2 ((48) and kept&#xD;
      safe in servers with &quot;log on&quot; and back ups, at Rigshospital and Slagelse Hospital, and are&#xD;
      only accessible for members of the project group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeschedule The research started at 2011.02.01. The observation phase runs from 2011.02.01&#xD;
      to 2011.12.31. The implementation phase starts 2012.01.01 and is expected to end the&#xD;
      2012.03.31. The intervention phase is scheduled when the mobilization protocol is&#xD;
      implemented, probably in 2012.04.01. The last patient is expected to be included in Jan 2013.&#xD;
      The research is expected to end 2014.01.31 Preliminary results are expected in Apr. 2014.&#xD;
      Final results are expected in July 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Settings The Anesthesiological Thorax ICU (4141) at Rigshospitalet has room for 19 patients.&#xD;
      The most commonly treated problems are heart failure, thorax surgery, lung transplantation&#xD;
      and thoracotomy. Adverse side effects are circulation failure, renal failure or sepsis with a&#xD;
      need for gradual reduction from ventilator and physical rehabilitation. The ICU has single&#xD;
      rooms, double rooms, one room for four patients and one for six patients. The physiotherapist&#xD;
      evaluates and starts the training which consists of excises to improve strength, the ability&#xD;
      to sit down, to stand up and to walk. The training is always medically prescribed. The&#xD;
      different transitions are taking place by use of a lift.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU at Slagelse Hospital has room for 10 patients, all in single rooms. The most commonly&#xD;
      treated patient groups are patients with complications after gastointestinal surgery, medical&#xD;
      or orthopedic patients. Compared to 4141 at Rigshospitalet the ICU at Slagelse also treats&#xD;
      patients with adverse side effects as circulation failure, renal failure, sepsis or patients&#xD;
      with a need for gradual reduction from a ventilator and need of physical rehabilitation. As&#xD;
      in 4141 at Rigshospitalet the physiotherapy is medically prescribed. The training consists of&#xD;
      prevention when the patient can not move, and when the patient can cooperate the training&#xD;
      consists of improving the physical functions, such as moving around in the bed, sitting at&#xD;
      the bedside, standing up, turning around and walking. As in 4141 at Rigshospitalet the&#xD;
      different transitions are taking place by use of a lift in the ceiling at the beginning. The&#xD;
      assistive technology used in both units, are ceiling lifts, walkers, wheelchairs, adaptable&#xD;
      armchairs and mobile ventilators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the observation phase and in the intervention phase data are collected as follows: The&#xD;
      nurse who is caring for the patient every day collects data regarding the evaluation of&#xD;
      consciousness, pain, basic mobility and security during mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A member of the project group (exh 12) includes the patient and obtains consent, and is&#xD;
      performing the test at discharge from the ICU, and again on the 5th day at the ward, and&#xD;
      finally at home after discharge. Before the visit at home, the patient is contacted by&#xD;
      telephone in order to accept and schedule a date for the visit and to allow us to send out a&#xD;
      questionnaire. The tests are conducted as close as possible to the day for discharge from the&#xD;
      ICU, the 5th day at the ward and 3 and 12 month after returning home. Deviation from the&#xD;
      exact date can for the first 2 tests vary +/- 1 day, and for the test after 3 and 12 month&#xD;
      +/- 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The project is approved by &quot;The Science/Ethical Committee&quot; (exh 13) and the&#xD;
      &quot;Datatilsynet&quot; according to the &quot;Law of Privacy&quot;, and the data are stored according to&#xD;
      regulations from the &quot;Datatilsynet&quot; (exh 14). The project is carried out according to&#xD;
      &quot;Ethical Guidelines for Research performed by Nurses in the Nordic Area&quot;, building on&#xD;
      &quot;Ethical Principles&quot; expressed in the Helsinki Declaration and UN Human Rights Declaration&#xD;
      (49, 50).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the observation phase, approval is gathered as soon as the patient is regarded as being&#xD;
      clear minded. If the patient is not situated in a single room, and because it is not always&#xD;
      possible or save to move the patient out of the bedroom, approval, in both the observation&#xD;
      phase and in the intervention phase, will be obtained with regard to the integrity of the&#xD;
      patient. The participants will be informed equally verbally and in writing and with the&#xD;
      present of a relative. If a participant does not wish to continue the project, he will be&#xD;
      excluded promptly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention phase the participants are often sedated and therefore it is necessary to&#xD;
      inform a relative/substitute/personal doctor both verbally and in writing in order to obtain&#xD;
      the approval. The relative will be contacted by one of the members of the project group when&#xD;
      the patient has been at the ICU for 24 hours, and approval is needed after further 24 hours.&#xD;
      The verbal information will be giving by a member of the steering group in a separate room&#xD;
      away from other patients. The written information will be handed out at the same time. Final&#xD;
      approval will be requested, only when the written information has been read. As soon as the&#xD;
      participant is assessed to be awake and clear minded, he will be asked for further&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Financing The results will be financed through the ICU accounts, but also by application to&#xD;
      funds (exh 8,19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Publication Results from the research, positive as well as negative, will be published in&#xD;
      scientific journals and an application for an article in CCN will be made.&#xD;
