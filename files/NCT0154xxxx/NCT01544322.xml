    <time_frame>One Cycle of 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Patients will be administered ME-344 IV infusions weekly for 3 weeks during the first 28 days cycle for dose limiting toxicity. Patients will be assessed by physical exam, vital signs, hematology and clinical chemistry, urinalysis, ECG, echocardiogram and pharmacokinetic sampling.</description>

    <time_frame>baseline and a minimum of every 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Radiologic assessments will be performed at baseline and a minimum of every 12 weeks. Patients may continue weekly dosing if there is clinical beneficial determined by the Investigator.</description>

    <description>experimental drug, dose escalation with 5 planned dose cohorts of 1.2 mg/kg, 2.5 mg/kg, 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg; Cycle 1 is 3 weekly IV infusions on Days 1, 8, and 15. After safety assessment, if there is clinical benefit, weekly dosing may continue until withdrawal.&#xD;
Once the highest tolerated dose has been determined, patients will be enrolled to receive IV infusions 2 days each week. Cycle 1 at the highest dose level is 3 weekly IV infusions on days 1, 2, 8, 9, 15 and 16. After safety assessment, if there is clinical benefit, weekly dosing may continue until withdrawal.</description>
