  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MRI has shoved little correlation with the clinical finding during treatment of&#xD;
      spondylodiscitis (infection in the vertebrae and/or discs). Since PET/CT is almost as good as&#xD;
      MRI in diagnosing spondylodiscitis the hypothesis and this study is that PET/CT is better in&#xD;
      predicting residual disease in patients with spondylodiscitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the last years there has been reported increasing incidence of spondylodiscitis. The&#xD;
      increase is mainly thought to be caused by the increasing elderly population and the&#xD;
      increasing amount of spinal instrumentation in this population. The symptoms range from&#xD;
      backache to severe neurological deficits. Up to 1/3 of cases are reported to be culture&#xD;
      negative and cases can therefore be difficult to diagnose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is thought to be the main imaging technique to visualise infection. But with the&#xD;
      increasing availability of 18-F FDG PET/CT, it is reported to be nearly as efficient to&#xD;
      diagnose spinal infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the long antibiotic treatment of spondylodiscitis, the clinicians have no real good&#xD;
      imaging technique to predict residual disease since MRI during the remodelling fase of the&#xD;
      spine will mimic no difference or worsening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 18-F-FDG PET marks areas with a high amount of inflammatory cells it may also be faster&#xD;
      in returning to normal images and therefore correlates better to actual status than MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some of the purposes of this study are therefore:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe changes on PET/CT and MRI at index and after 4, 8 12 and 26 weeks and&#xD;
           compare these to the clinical findings as well as inflammatory biomarkers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the correlation between normalisation of inflammatory biomarkers and&#xD;
           changes on MRI and PET/CT.&#xD;
