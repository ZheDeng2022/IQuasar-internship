    <textblock>
      This single site study will be conducted at the UT Southwestern Simmons Cancer Center. This&#xD;
      study is designed to measure drug concentrations in the blood of 18 female breast cancer&#xD;
      patients who require doxorubicin (30 minute infusion) and cyclophosphamide (30 minute&#xD;
      infusion) as part of standard medical care. Up to a total of 40 adult female participants&#xD;
      will be consented for the study at the cancer center. Eighteen of these participants are&#xD;
      needed to complete the study. The others will likely be screen failures. The participants&#xD;
      will have no more than 100 ml of blood drawn via a peripheral intravenous catheter just prior&#xD;
      to the doxorubicin infusion, and then at 0.5, 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12-24, and 24-72 h after&#xD;
      the beginning of the doxorubicin infusion. The 5 hour blood draw is optional. The intravenous&#xD;
      catheter will be removed when the participant is discharged from the cancer center on day 1.&#xD;
      The participant will be asked to return to the cancer center at 12-24 and 24-72 hours to have&#xD;
      the final 2 blood draws conducted. The participants must be treated with Doxorubicin and&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide in order to participate in this pharmacokinetic analysis study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will require a total of 11 participant contacts over 3 days (1 day outpatient&#xD;
      clinic visit for doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide infusions and blood draws, 2 follow up&#xD;
      outpatient clinic visits for blood draws) with no more than 100 mL of blood being drawn. All&#xD;
      blood draws will be collected for the purpose of research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening and Informed Consent Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The participant's height, weight, medical history, comorbid conditions, and current&#xD;
           medications will be obtained from the electronic medical record (EMR).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Update 1 : January 12, 2012&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study personnel will provide the participant with additional information about the study&#xD;
           and provide the participant with the opportunity to ask any questions. Each participant&#xD;
           will then be asked if she is willing to provide informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Information from the routine physical examination including vital signs&#xD;
           (temperature,respiratory rate, blood pressure, heart rate) will be collected from the&#xD;
           medical chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures and Evaluation during the Research&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Each participant will then have no more than10ml of blood drawn 8 times, at t=0h&#xD;
           (predose),at the end of the doxorubicin infusion, at the end cyclophosphamide infusion,&#xD;
           and 1.5, 2, 3, 4, 5, 12-24, and 24-72 h following the beginning of doxorubicin infusion.&#xD;
           All blood draws will be performed using the peripheral intravenous catheter being used&#xD;
           for standard medical care. Labels on blood samples will not contain participant name,&#xD;
           but a randomly generated participant identification number.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All blood samples will placed on ice and immediately transported to Dr. Richard Leff's&#xD;
           laboratory for sample preparation.9 Samples will be spun in a refrigerated centrifuge&#xD;
           and then placed in a -80oC freezer. As explained below, Dr. Leff or his laboratory will&#xD;
           not have access to any participant identifiers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The participant is discharged from the cancer center (for research purposes) after the 4&#xD;
           hour blood draw, unless the participant is willing to stay for the 5 hour blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The participant will return to the cancer center at 12-24 and 24-72 hours for blood&#xD;
           draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The participant is discharged from the study after the 24-72h blood draw. Follow-up:&#xD;
           Participants will be asked to return to the cancer center for 12-24 and 24-72 hour blood&#xD;
           draws.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Females,&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age 18 years of age or older, of all racial and ethnic origins that are scheduled to&#xD;
             receive the first cycle of a single intravenous dose of doxorubicin (30 minute&#xD;
             infusion) and cyclophosphamide (30 minute infusion) as part of standard medical care&#xD;

                  paclitaxel, phenytoin, sorafenib, valspodar, verapamil&#xD;
&#xD;
