      Background and Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs used as recommended by the WHO does not promote pain relief for all patients with&#xD;
      cancer pain. The objective of this study was to evaluate the use of morphine as the first&#xD;
      drug for the treatment of moderate cancer pain by visual analogue scale in patients with&#xD;
      advanced disease and / or metastases, as an alternative to the recommendations of the WHO&#xD;
      analgesic ladder advocated. Methods: The patients without opioid therapy with more than 18&#xD;
      years, were randomly divided into two groups. G1 patients received medication according to&#xD;
      the analgesic ladder, starting treatment with non-opioid in the first step, the second weak&#xD;
      opioid and opioid potent in the third, and G2 received morphine as first analgesic. There was&#xD;
      evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of initial use of morphine every 2 weeks for 3&#xD;
      months. Results: The study was performed in 63 patients. The groups had similar demographics.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After approval of the Ethics Committee and signing the consent, a prospective randomized&#xD;
      study was performed in patients ≥ 18 years, with locally advanced cancer and / or metastases,&#xD;
      and pain intensity ≤ 6. There were excluded patients with difficulty maintaining clinical&#xD;
      follow-up, cognitive impairment and prior treatment with opioids. G1 patients were treated&#xD;
      according to the guidelines of the WHO analgesic ladder starting at the first step, with&#xD;
      paracetamol 1g each 6 hours, maximum dose of 4 g/ day, in the second, codeine (30 mg each 4&#xD;
      hours , maximum dose 360 mg / day and morphine 10 mg each 4 hours in the third step. Patients&#xD;
      in G2 started with morphine 10 mg each 4 hours. Adjuvant drugs have been associated when&#xD;
      indicated. According to the intensity of pain the medication was changed according to&#xD;
      analgesic ladder in G1 patients and adjusted the dose in G2. The cancer therapy as palliative&#xD;
      radiotherapy, chemotherapy or hormone therapy was performed by the oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There were evaluated: pain intensity every 2 wk. by visual analogue scale (VAS), quality of&#xD;
      life every 4 wk. through the brief questionnaire of quality of life of the WHO 19,&#xD;
      satisfaction with treatment, physical capacity measured by the index of Eastern Cooperative&#xD;
      Oncology Group (ECOG) 20, and the need for additional analgesics. Adverse effects were&#xD;
      recorded. The study was considered completed with the patient's death or three months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the minimum sample size was used the program BioEstat 2.0. There were used as&#xD;
      reference means and standard deviations values of study with a similar method 5. Considering&#xD;
      a confidence level of 95% study power of 80% of the minimum sample of 30 patients for each&#xD;
      group, totaling 60 patients. For the statistical analysis was used GraphPad Prism ®. There&#xD;
      was used the Student t test for age, weight, height, chi-square test for patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, need for complementation, and adverse effects, and Mann-Whitney test for pain&#xD;
      intensity, quality of life and physical capacity. A p value of ≤ 0,05 was considered&#xD;
      significant. The resultas were expressed as mean ± DP.&#xD;
