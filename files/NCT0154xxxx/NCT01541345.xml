  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since there are no clinical studies available comparing the gold standard (autogenous bone&#xD;
      graft plus resorbable membrane) to the promising combination of xenogenic bone graft loaded&#xD;
      with rhBMP-2 in combination with a collagen membrane for localized ridge augmentation, the&#xD;
      present exploratory study has been designed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is therefore to test whether or not the application of a&#xD;
      xenogenic bone block loaded with rhBMP-2 will results in clinically, radiographically and&#xD;
      histologically similar outcomes as the gold standard (autogenous bone block) for the&#xD;
      regeneration of chronic ridge defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that there is no difference in bone quantity and quality between the&#xD;
      two methods and that the use of the test treatment will be more user and patient friendly&#xD;
      according to the patient perception/acceptance since no second surgical site will be&#xD;
      necessary as well as cause less complications.&#xD;
