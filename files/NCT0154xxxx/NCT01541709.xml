  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      KIT exon 9 mutants had poorer survival compared with KIT exon 11 mutants when they were&#xD;
      treated with the same dose of imatinib, 400 mg per day, and that patients with KIT exon 9&#xD;
      mutation had better progression-free survival with imatinib treatment at an escalated dose,&#xD;
      800 mg per day, than with imatinib treatment at a dose of 400 mg per day.10,11 Based on the&#xD;
      results, imatinib 800 mg per day is now considered the standard dose for the treatment of&#xD;
      patients with metastatic or unresectable GIST showing KIT exon 9 mutation in Western&#xD;
      countries.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      According to our previous prospective phase II study of imatinib 400 mg per day in metastatic&#xD;
      or unresectable GIST, hematologic and non-hematologic toxicities were more frequent in Korean&#xD;
      patients compared to the Western studies.7 It may be caused by relatively higher exposure to&#xD;
      imatinib per body surface area in Korean patients than in Western population because the&#xD;
      weight and height of Korean patients are relatively smaller than Western people. So, we plan&#xD;
      to start imatinib at 400 mg per day and then sequentially escalate the doses of imatinib in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
