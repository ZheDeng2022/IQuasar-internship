    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I study, which means that the goal is to see if the study treatment is safe.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of Lenalidomide at different dose levels, and&#xD;
      to test the safety of Lenalidomide alone or in combination with Rituximab (also known as&#xD;
      Rituxan®).&#xD;

      Rationale for the Proposed Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is evidence that immunomodulatory drugs such as lenalidomide stimulate immune effectors&#xD;
      such as natural killer (NK) cells, and thus promote rituximab efficacy via ADCC. Because of&#xD;
      the evidence for synergy between rituximab and lenalidomide in NHL, patients who do not&#xD;
      respond to lenalidomide monotherapy will receive combined intravenous plus intraventricular&#xD;
      rituximab in addition to lenalidomide. To maximize delivery to the central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS), the investigators propose to administer rituximab via both intravenous and&#xD;
      intraventricular routes. The rationale for intraventricular administration of rituximab is&#xD;
      the demonstration that approximately 0.1% of systemically administered rituximab penetrates&#xD;
      the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) but that intraventricular administration of rituximab is both&#xD;
      feasible and achieves high concentrations that are associated with anti-lymphoma activity.&#xD;
      This study will thus build upon the two Phase 1 trials of intraventricular rituximab that&#xD;
      have been conducted at University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) to define the safety of&#xD;
      the intraventricular route of administration; this study will, however, be the first to&#xD;
      evaluate the combination of intraventricular plus intravenous treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for intravenous administration of rituximab in recurrent CNS lymphoma is that&#xD;
      the blood-brain-barrier is likely partially disrupted, particularly when there is&#xD;
      lymphoma-associated contrast enhancement detectable on the MRI, and the fact that there is&#xD;
      evidence for activity when rituximab is administered intravenously, both as monotherapy&#xD;
      (Batchelor et al., 2011) and potentially in combination with chemotherapy.&#xD;
