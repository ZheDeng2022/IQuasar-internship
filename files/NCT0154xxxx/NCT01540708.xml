      The purpose of this study is to optimise the device and/or formulation of the Fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate (FP)/salmeterol (SALM) unit dose powder inhaler (Rotahaler) to achieve drug&#xD;
      delivery characteristics comparable to the Fluticasone propionate /salmeterol DISKUS inhaler.&#xD;
      The indication is asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The study is an&#xD;
      open-label, randomised, cross-over, single centre study in healthy volunteers and will be&#xD;
      conducted in a maximum of 3 parts, A, B and C. The design is adaptive and pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK) data analysis follows each part to enable a decision on whether progression to the&#xD;
      subsequent parts is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of the study will test an alternative version of the Rotahaler with a low airflow&#xD;
      resistance. The study will then test one or more of the following options depending on the&#xD;
      outcome of part A. If progressed, part B will test modified Rotacap formulations including:&#xD;
      (1) modified blend formulation, (2) reduced capsule fill weights, (3) different capsule&#xD;
      types. Part B will also test other versions of the Rotahaler with intermediate airflow&#xD;
      resistance. Part C will test the lower strength FP/salmeterol (100/50 mcg or lower) and/or a&#xD;
      new unit dose DPI device (BUDI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 36 subjects will be enrolled in each part to ensure 32 complete. In each&#xD;
      cross-over arm, subjects will be administered 7 doses (3.5 days bid) with PK sampling&#xD;
      following administration of the 7th dose. A three-day minimum wash-out period will separate&#xD;
      each cross-over arm.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterised by varying and&#xD;
      recurring symptoms of shortness of breath, chest tightness, wheezing and cough, airflow&#xD;
      obstruction, bronchial hyper-responsiveness and underlying inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GINA guidelines [Global Initiative for Asthma,(GINA) updated 2009] highlight the need to&#xD;
      treat airway inflammation in asthma and recognise the importance of inhaled prophylactic&#xD;
      medications such as inhaled corticosteroids and combinations of Inhaled Corticosteroids (ICS)&#xD;
      / Long Acting Beta Agonists (LABA) such as SERETIDE™ for the treatment of chronic asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a preventable and treatable disease&#xD;
      characterised by airflow limitation that is not fully reversible [Celli, 2004]. The airflow&#xD;
      limitation of COPD is primarily due to small airways disease and parenchymal destruction&#xD;
      associated with an abnormal inflammatory response of the lungs, mainly caused by cigarette&#xD;
      smoking [Celli 2004]. COPD is characterised by symptoms of chronic and progressive&#xD;
      breathlessness (or dyspnea), cough and sputum production which can be a major cause of&#xD;
      disability and anxiety associated with the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The GOLD (Global Strategy for the Diagnosis, Management and Prevention of Chronic Obstructive&#xD;
      Pulmonary Disease) guidelines on COPD state that the goals of pharmacologic therapy should be&#xD;
      to control symptoms, improve health status and exercise tolerance, and reduce the frequency&#xD;
      of COPD exacerbations [GOLD, 2008]. Research has indicated that an inhaled corticosteroid&#xD;
      (ICS) combined with a long acting β2-agonist (LABA) is more effective than the individual&#xD;
      components in managing stable COPD to reduce exacerbations and improve lung function and&#xD;
      health status [Ferguson, 2008; Calverley, 2007; Kardos, 2007].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of the combination product, SERETIDE has been established in the metered dose&#xD;
      inhaler (MDI) and multidose powder inhaler (Ddpi; DISKUS™/Accuhaler) in both asthma and&#xD;
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease, COPD at a variety of dose strengths.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternative treatment options with respect to the formulation of SERETIDE and its means of&#xD;
      delivery via an inhaler device are currently being assessed by GSK with a view to developing&#xD;
      a product with bioavailability characteristics comparable to those of SERETIDE delivered via&#xD;
      the multi-dose powder inhaler (DISKUS™/Accuhaler). It is intended that the product will then&#xD;
      be progressed for treatment administration in both asthma and COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recently completed study, ASR114334, [GlaxoSmithKline document number YM2010/00082/02]&#xD;
      evaluated the comparative bioavailability of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol delivered via&#xD;
      the established multi-dose powder inhaler (Ddpi, DISKUS/Accuhaler) with the Rotahaler unit&#xD;
      dose fluticasone propionate/salmeterol capsule-based powder inhaler (Rdpi) in both asthma and&#xD;
      COPD patients. The Rotahaler (Rdpi) inhaler had an airflow resistance similar to the DISKUS&#xD;
      multi-dose inhaler (Ddpi). Whilst the active ingredients were a combination of fluticasone&#xD;
      propionate/salmeterol, the devices were different with respect to their handling and&#xD;
      instructions for operation, although both were designed to deliver at the 250/50mcg bid dose&#xD;
      strength ie mcg equivalent doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results showed that plasma exposures of both fluticasone propionate (FP) and salmeterol&#xD;
      were 1.5 to 2 fold higher following repeat dose administration of FP/salmeterol delivered&#xD;
      from the Rdpi compared with those from the Ddpi, [GlaxoSmithKline document number&#xD;
      2011N112456_00]. This was observed for both asthma and COPD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study, ASR116409 is to optimise the device and/or formulation of the&#xD;
      FP/salmeterol unit dose powder inhaler to achieve drug delivery characteristics comparable to&#xD;
      the FP/salmeterol DISKUS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DOSE RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two doses of FP/salmeterol will be administered in this study: 250/50 mcg and 100/50 mcg or&#xD;
      lower, both doses are approved for the treatment of asthma. These doses will be administered&#xD;
      to healthy subjects and are at or below the maximum approved doses for FP and salmeterol&#xD;
      indicated for chronic therapy in asthma; therefore there are no anticipated safety concerns&#xD;
      associated with the planned short term (3.5 days bid) dosing in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an open-label, randomised, cross-over, single centre study in healthy volunteers&#xD;
      in 3 parts, A, B and C. It will be conducted with an adaptive design where pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      data analysis follows each part to enable a decision on whether progression to the subsequent&#xD;
      parts is required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 36 subjects will be enrolled in each part to ensure 32 complete. In each&#xD;
      cross-over arm, subjects will be administered 7 doses (3.5 days bid) with PK sampling&#xD;
      following administration of the 7th dose. A three-day minimum wash-out period will separate&#xD;
      each cross-over arm. Subjects may elect to participate in more than one part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will compare the bioavailability characteristics of the following GSK devices: the&#xD;
      Ddpi (multi-dose dry powder inhaler, DISKUS), the Rdpi(H) (capsule-based inhaler, high&#xD;
      airflow resistance) and the Rdpi(L) (low airflow resistance). The Rdpi(H) has higher airflow&#xD;
      resistance to the Ddpi compared to the Rdpi (L) and could allow a closer PK match. Part A&#xD;
      will consist of a four treatment cross-over sub-study with the following arms, each arm&#xD;
      replicated twice for each subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment arms for part A will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           Ddpi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           Rdpi(H). Instructions for subjects will be to take 2 steady, deep inhalations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           Rdpi(L). Instructions for subjects will be to take 1 fast and deep inhalation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           Rdpi(L). Instructions for subjects will be to take fast and deep inhalations until no&#xD;
           powder remains in the inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Rdpi(H) device (250/50mcg FP/salmeterol) is being assessed in Part A to bridge the data&#xD;
      back to the previous study (ASR114334) to show whether it is possible to replicate the 1.5 to&#xD;
      2 fold systemic exposure ratio for Rdpi(H)/Ddpi in healthy subjects compared to patients seen&#xD;
      in the previous study (ASR114334).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be dosed twice daily for 3 days and once on the fourth day in the morning. The&#xD;
      first dose on Day 1 will be administered at the site and the next four doses will be&#xD;
      self-administered by the subjects at home. They will attend the Unit in the evening of the&#xD;
      3rd day where they will be administered the 6th dose and remain at the Unit for the night and&#xD;
      following day. They will be dosed in clinic (7th dose) on the morning of the fourth day and&#xD;
      remain at site until completion of the 12 hour post-dose PK sample collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following a 3-day minimum wash-out period after the last dose of study medication (Day 4),&#xD;
      subjects will participate in the subsequent arms of Part A until they have completed all 4&#xD;
      arms twice i.e. the 8 periods planned for completion of Part A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PK samples will be analysed and reviewed at the conclusion of Part A. If PK equivalence for&#xD;
      FP and SALM is demonstrated between the Rdpi(L)and the Ddpi, and Rdpi(H)is demonstrated to&#xD;
      have higher and non-equivalent PK systemic exposure compared to Ddpi, Part C will be&#xD;
      conducted. If PK equivalence is not demonstrated, Part B will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Study design for Part B will depend on the PK results from Part A. Prior to the start&#xD;
      of part B, a decision will be made by the sponsor team as to whether the Rdpi (H) or the&#xD;
      Rdpi(L) device will be used; this decision will be based on PK data from part A. FP/Salm&#xD;
      250/50mcg from the Ddpi will be included again in Part B as a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the plasma exposures of FP and SALM obtained during Part A from Rdpi(H) are statistically&#xD;
      higher than those from the Dpi and those from Rdpi (L) are statistically lower than those&#xD;
      from the Ddpi, Part B will assess two intermediate airflow resistance versions of the Rdpi&#xD;
      [Rdpi (IM)] and/or the formulation changes below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  modified blend formulations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduced capsule fill weights,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  different capsule types If the plasma exposures of FP and SALM obtained from the Rdpi(H)&#xD;
           are statistically higher than those from the Dpi and those from the Rdpi(L) are&#xD;
           statistically higher than those from the Ddpi, Part B will assess the formulation&#xD;
           changes below using Rdpi(H);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  modified blend formulations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  reduced capsule fill weights,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  different capsule types One variable will be assessed at a time in an open-label,&#xD;
           randomized, cross-over manner comprising 2 to 3 arms separated by a 3-day minimum&#xD;
           wash-out period. All comparisons will be done against the DISKUS arm, in order to test&#xD;
           bioequivalence. The sample size and the use of replicated arms will be evaluated and&#xD;
           defined after the completion of part A, adapting the design and the sample size to the&#xD;
           variability observed during the previous part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following PK data analysis for all the variables, two or more variables may finally be&#xD;
      grouped for combined assessment as an open-label investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation of the two intermediate high airflow resistance Rdpi devices [Rdpi(IM)] and of the&#xD;
      formulation changes will be conducted in a cross-over design. The inhalation instructions&#xD;
      (number and type of breaths) will be decided after Part A is completed. An additional arm&#xD;
      whereby subjects will be administered the Ddpi will also be included for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C will compare bioavailability parameters for 2 dosage strengths of FP/salmeterol:&#xD;
      100/50 mcg, and 250/50mcg, delivered from the Ddpi and the device/formulation shown to&#xD;
      demonstrate bioequivalence in Part A and/or Part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another GSK unit dose device in development, the BUDI inhaler, will also be evaluated for its&#xD;
      comparative bioavailability characteristics at both doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If PK data from Part A demonstrates that the Rdpi(L) is PK equivalent to the Ddpi at the&#xD;
      250/50 mcg dose, Part B will not be conducted. We will also test the bovine capsule which may&#xD;
      be needed for certain markets in Part C if Part B is not conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various arms in Part C will not be conducted concurrently as timing of dosing for each&#xD;
      arm will depend on availability of study medication, device and capsule type.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C will therefore be conducted at two different points in time: Part C1 will consist of a&#xD;
      3 or 4-way cross-over sub-study with the following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           Ddpi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (100/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           Ddpi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (100/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           device/formulation combination selected in Part A or B&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           Bovine capsule (if part B is not performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C2 will be performed if required when the BUDI inhaler will be made available, a&#xD;
      cross-over sub-study with the following arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           Ddpi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (100/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           Ddpi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via BUDI&#xD;
           Inhaler&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Administration of 7 doses (3.5 days bid) of FP/salmeterol (100/50mcg) delivered via the&#xD;
           BUDI Inhaler.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inhalation instructions (number and type of breaths) will be decided after part A is&#xD;
      completed&#xD;
&#xD;
      The option to combine Parts C1 and C2 will be evaluated according to the:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  availability of the BUDI Inhaler and the timing of Part C&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PK results from the previous parts (variability could affect the need to have replicated&#xD;
           arms in part C as well; further, the bovine capsule may have been already tested in part&#xD;
           B).&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To select a device and formulation combination of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol&#xD;
           (250/50mcg or lower) which has pharmacokinetic equivalence (ratio 0.8 to 1.25) to&#xD;
           fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via the Ddpi (multi dose dry&#xD;
           powder inhaler)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the pharmacokinetic parameters of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol&#xD;
           (250/50mcg or lower) delivered from a range of devices and/or formulations to those of&#xD;
           fluticasone propionate/salmeterol (250/50mcg) delivered via the Ddpi in healthy&#xD;
           volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the pharmacokinetic equivalence of the selected device/formulation&#xD;
           combination of fluticasone propionate/salmeterol administered at a lower dose to match&#xD;
           fluticasone propionate/salmeterol administered at the 100/50mcg dose from the Ddpi&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the PK characteristics of the BUDI inhaler containing 100/50mcg fluticasone&#xD;
           propionate/salmeterol and 250/50mcg fluticasone propionate/salmeterol.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      -Pharmacokinetic endpoint: Area under the plasma fluticasone propionate concentration-time&#xD;
      curve over dosing interval ; maximum observed concentration for fluticasone propionate and&#xD;
      salmeterol plasma concentration-time curve on the last day of each study treatment period&#xD;
      (Day 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY ENDPOINT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Pharmacokinetic parameters: time of maximum observed concentration;terminal phase rate&#xD;
      constant; terminal phase half-life for fluticasone propionate and salmeterol) on the last day&#xD;
      of each treatment period (Day 4).&#xD;

    <description>The study will be conducted in 3 parts with an adaptive design where pharmacokinetic data analysis follows each part to enable a decision on whether progression to the subsequent parts is required. Thirty six subjects will be enrolled in each part. Part A will test an alternative version of the Rotahaler with a lower airflow resistance. The study will then test one or more of the following options depending on the outcome of part A. If progressed, part B will test modified Rotacap formulations including: (1) modified blend formulation, (2) reduced capsule fill weights, (3) different capsule types. Part B will also test other versions of the Rotahaler with intermediate airflow resistance. Part C will test the lower strength FP/salmeterol (100/50 mcg or lower) and/or a new unit dose DPI device (BUDI). In each arm, subjects will be administered 7 doses (3.5 days bid) with PK sampling following administration of the 7th dose on the morning of Day 4.</description>

        INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be eligible for inclusion in this study only if all of the following&#xD;
        criteria apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT, alkaline phosphatase and bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5xULN (isolated&#xD;
             bilirubin &gt;1.5xULN is acceptable if bilirubin is fractionated and direct bilirubin&#xD;
             &lt;35%).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Single QTc, QTcB or QTcF &lt; 450 msec; or QTc &lt; 480 msec in subjects with Bundle Branch&#xD;
             Block.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy as determined by a responsible and experienced physician, based on a medical&#xD;
             evaluation including medical history, physical examination, laboratory tests and&#xD;
             cardiac monitoring. A subject with a clinical abnormality or laboratory parameters&#xD;
             outside the reference range for the population being studied may be included only if&#xD;
             the Investigator and the GSK Medical Monitor agree that the finding is unlikely to&#xD;
             introduce additional risk factors and will not interfere with the study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female between 18 and 65 years of age inclusive, at the time of signing the&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A female subject is eligible to participate if she is of:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-childbearing potential defined as pre-menopausal females with a documented tubal&#xD;
             ligation or hysterectomy; or postmenopausal defined as 12 months of spontaneous&#xD;
             amenorrhea [in questionable cases a blood sample with simultaneous follicle&#xD;
             stimulating hormone (FSH) &gt; 40 MlU/ml and estradiol &lt; 40 pg/ml (&lt;147 pmol/L) is&#xD;
             confirmatory]. Females on hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and whose menopausal&#xD;
             status is in doubt will be required to use one of the protocol approved contraception&#xD;
             methods if they wish to continue their HRT during the study. Otherwise, they must&#xD;
             discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of post-menopausal status prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment. For most forms of HRT, at least 2-4 weeks should elapse between the&#xD;
             cessation of therapy and the blood draw; this interval depends on the type and dosage&#xD;
             of HRT. Following confirmation of their post-menopausal status, they can resume use of&#xD;
             HRT during the study without use of a contraceptive method.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Child-bearing potential and is abstinent or agrees to use one of the protocol approved&#xD;
             contraception methods for an appropriate period of time (as determined by the product&#xD;
             label or investigator) prior to the start of dosing to sufficiently minimize the risk&#xD;
             of pregnancy at that point. Female subjects must agree to use contraception until the&#xD;
             follow-up visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Capable of giving informed consent, which includes compliance with the study&#xD;
             requirements and restrictions listed in the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI within the range 18 and 35 kg/m2 (inclusive).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to use the inhaler devices adequately after training&#xD;
&#xD;
