  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The RV 156A clinical trial is evaluating an experimental HIV vaccine in people who are not&#xD;
      infected with HIV. Participants in that study are randomly assigned to receive either the HIV&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo. This study will enroll people who are participating in the RV 156 study.&#xD;
      In this study, researchers will evaluate the safety of and immune response to a different&#xD;
      experimental HIV vaccine in people who participated in the RV 156 study.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RV 156A is a single site, phase 1 open label study with accrual restricted to participants in&#xD;
      RV 156. Participants in the RV 156 study were randomly assigned to receive three injections&#xD;
      of either placebo or the VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP vaccine. All participants in this study will&#xD;
      receive one injection of a different experimental HIV vaccine, VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of the VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP&#xD;
      vaccine in people who participated in the RV 156 study. Researchers will examine the&#xD;
      differences in the immune response to the VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP vaccine between people who&#xD;
      received placebo in the RV 156 study and people who received the VRC-HIVDNA009-00-VP vaccine&#xD;
      in the RV 156 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A projected number of up to 29 volunteers will be enrolled from the Makerere University site&#xD;
      in Uganda. At study entry, all participants will undergo a physical examination, medical&#xD;
      history review, vital sign measurements, and blood and urine collection. They will also&#xD;
      receive counseling for HIV prevention and pregnancy prevention. Participants will then&#xD;
      receive one injection of the VRC-HIVADV014-00-VP vaccine in their upper arm. They will remain&#xD;
      in the clinic for 30 to 45 minutes for observation and monitoring. For 3 days after the&#xD;
      vaccination, participants will record their temperature and any adverse symptoms in a diary.&#xD;
      Additional study visits will occur at Days 3, 14, 28, 42, 84, 168, 252, and 336. At each&#xD;
      visit, participants will undergo the same study procedures that they completed at the study&#xD;
      entry visit.&#xD;
