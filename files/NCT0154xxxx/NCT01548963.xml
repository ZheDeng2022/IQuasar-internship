      It is known that acute stress of organism often leads to hyperglycemia even in nondiabetic&#xD;
      patients. It is also known that pathophysiological mechanisms: enhanced gluconeogenesis,&#xD;
      impaired insulin secretion and decreased insulin sensitivity due to anti-insulin effect of&#xD;
      stress hormones and proinflammatory cytokines, or changes of glucose excretion and renal&#xD;
      tubular resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies proved the negative effects of hyperglycemia to different tissues and organs,&#xD;
      e.g. hearth (increasing size of myocardial necrosis, reducing coronary collateral blood flow,&#xD;
      exaggerating ischemia-reperfusion injury, impairing ischemic preconditioning), vascular&#xD;
      (increased risk of thrombosis, endothelial dysfunction, activation of systemic inflammation&#xD;
      with destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques), kidneys and its association with infectious&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first Leuven study (published in 2001) demonstrated that hyperglycemia in critical care&#xD;
      patients significantly increases risk of organ complication and total mortality. Although the&#xD;
      importance of postoperative tight glycemia control is now widely accepted, glycemia stability&#xD;
      during cardiac surgery is often neglected. It is known that postoperative hyperglycemia has&#xD;
      negative effects, but it is not known what effect has its peroperative elevation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal of this study is to demonstrate, whether full perioperative intensive glycemia control&#xD;
      can reduce the incidence of postoperative morbidity even more than postoperative glycemia&#xD;
      control only.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It has been for a long time a well known phenomenon that the acute stress of organism induced&#xD;
      for instance by an extensive surgery often leads to hyperglycemia, even in patients without a&#xD;
      previous history of diabetes. Also well known are the common pathophysiological mechanisms,&#xD;
      which are responsible for this, such as enhanced hepatic gluconeogenesis, impaired insulin&#xD;
      secretion and decreased insulin sensitivity due to anti-insulin effect of stress hormones and&#xD;
      proinflammatory cytokines, or a change of glucose excretion and higher renal tubular&#xD;
      resorption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies proved the negative effect of the elevated blood glucose level to different&#xD;
      tissues and organs. Even short-term hyperglycemia has been found to markedly impair&#xD;
      cardiovascular function in ischemic heart, increasing size of myocardial necrosis, reducing&#xD;
      coronary collateral blood flow, exaggerating ischemia-reperfusion cellular injury and/or&#xD;
      impairing ischemic preconditioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also other studies have identified numerous hyperglycemia-induced abnormalities such as&#xD;
      increased risk of thrombosis, endothelial disfunction or activation of systemic inflammation,&#xD;
      with possible destabilization of atherosclerotic plaques leading to acute ischemic syndromes.&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia also has effect to the extent of renal injury, e.g. in patients after cardiac&#xD;
      surgery, and last but not least, hyperglycemia has been associated with increased&#xD;
      postoperative infectious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite all those facts hyperglycemia has been until recently considered as a &quot;protective&quot;&#xD;
      mechanism for patients in critical condition, when the cells are offered a supranormal amount&#xD;
      of easily accessible energy. This approach has been radically changed thanks to Leuven study&#xD;
      published by prof.Van den Berghe and her colleagues in 2001 in New England Journal of&#xD;
      Medicine. This fundamental study proved that a higher levels of blood glucose in intensive&#xD;
      care patients significantly increase the risk of organ complications as well as an overall&#xD;
      death rate, and that, on the contrary, we can significantly decrease both mortality, as well&#xD;
      as the amount of organ complications connected with the critical state by an intensive&#xD;
      insulin therapy aimed to keep normoglycemia. Such results were confirmed also by another&#xD;
      study of prof.Van den Berghe and her colleagues (published in NEJM 2006), this time performed&#xD;
      on non-surgery patients. This fact was quickly accepted by the intensivists and therefore it&#xD;
      is nowadays commonplace for us to carefully monitor blood glucose levels in postoperative&#xD;
      ICU, and keep it at normal levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the above-mentioned studies are even more significant for cardiac surgery patients,&#xD;
      since the population of the patients in the first Leuven study (2001), where the results of&#xD;
      intensive insulinotherapy were more distinct in comparison with non-surgery population (2006)&#xD;
      mostly thanks to a 40% reduced mortality, consisted up to 63% from patients following cardiac&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If normoglycemia is commonplace in postoperative intensive care, then the stability of&#xD;
      glycemia during cardiac surgery is usually neglected. There is no clear recommendation&#xD;
      regarding when it is suitable to start intensive control of glycemia, whether to do so after&#xD;
      the surgery or already during the surgery. We know that postoperative hyperglycemia has many&#xD;
      negative effects on the organism, however, we do not know yet whether the peroperative rise&#xD;
      of blood glucose itself during cardiac or other extensive surgery with postoperative&#xD;
      maintenance of normoglycemia has negative or benefiting effects on the organism. Until now,&#xD;
      there has not yet been a valid study performed that would answer this concrete question.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE GOALS OF THE PROJECT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to prove whether by full perioperative intensive control of&#xD;
      glycemia, the occurrence of organ complications will be decreased even more significantly&#xD;
      than by only postoperative normalization of hyperglycemia, what has already been proved by&#xD;
      published studies. This proposed study is aiming at complementing the fundamental Leuven&#xD;
      study with perioperative data and therefore answering the question, when to start the control&#xD;
      of glycemia by an intensified insulinotherapy in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decisive factor for the success of the project is also a quality protocol of glycemia&#xD;
      control in perioperative care. During the previous years there were a number of various&#xD;
      insulin protocols that more or less successfully tried to keep the levels of blood glucose in&#xD;
      normoglycemia. Thanks to the European study of CLINICIP (Closed Loop Insulin Infusion for&#xD;
      Critically Ill Patients) our Department took part in as a clinical partner, the investigators&#xD;
      had the possibility to evaluate several European protocols and to compare them with the&#xD;
      computer algorithm MPC (Model Predictive Control). The comparison of the possibilities to&#xD;
      keep the levels of blood glucose in normoglycemia ended positively in favors of eMPC&#xD;
      algorithm compare to the standard protocols. Therefore the investigators decided to use its&#xD;
      adaptative version also in this project for glycemia control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      THE HYPOTHESIS AND EXPECTED RESULTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize, that if the postoperative normalization of already started&#xD;
      hyperglycemia can significantly decreases the occurrence of postoperative complications, then&#xD;
      absolute perioperative glycemia control, thanks to complete blockage of the negative&#xD;
      influences of even the short term hyperglycemia, can even further emphasize the reduction of&#xD;
      the postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome - to prove, whether the full blocking of the perioperative blood glucose&#xD;
      elevation will reach a lower occurrence of postoperative organ complications, than in&#xD;
      patients with a temporary peroperative rise of glycemia. The investigators will observe a&#xD;
      number of adverse events (newly developed organ dysfunctions) from any cause during the&#xD;
      postoperative hospital stay:&#xD;
&#xD;
      cardiovascular (LCO, postoperatively initiated inotropic support or intra-aortic balloon&#xD;
      counterpulsation, acute myocardial ischemia, moderate to severe arrhythmias, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      resuscitation), respiratory (acute pneumonia, fluidothorax &gt; 300 ml, reintubation, acute&#xD;
      respiratory distress syndrome/acute lung injury), neurological (stroke, transient ischemic&#xD;
      attack), gastrointestinal (ileus, gastric ulcer, gastrointestinal bleeding, hepatopathy,&#xD;
      acute pancreatitis, need of parenteral nutrition), renal (acute kidney injury defined by&#xD;
      RIFLE criteria - stage Injury and above) infections defined by clinical picture and the need&#xD;
      of systemic antibiotic therapy Scoring systems (Euroscore, TISS 28, APACHE II, SAPS3)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      in-hospital mortality, ICU time further development of MPC algorithm&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME SCHEDULE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year 1- starting the project, establishment of a database, recruitment of patients (800) and&#xD;
      processing of partial results Year 2- project review, recruitment of patients (800) and&#xD;
      processing of partial results and their presentation Year 3- project review, recruitment of&#xD;
      patients (800), final results processing and their publication, study ending&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type of the study: prospective, randomized, controlled, double blinded Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
      patients undergoing cardiac surgery, men and women aged 18-90 years, signed informed consent&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: patient's dissent, allergy to insulin or other components added to&#xD;
      insulin solution Reasons for exclusion during study: repeated (twice) major hypoglycemia&#xD;
      Randomization: on admission to OR into two equally large groups (A, B), after signed informed&#xD;
      consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      A = Group of intensive glycemia control: blood glucose level will be maintained by continuous&#xD;
      insulin infusion (Actrapid, Novo Nordisk A/S, Bagsvaerd, Danemark - 50 IU/50 ml FR) according&#xD;
      to actual glycemia to keep it within normoglycemia limits (4.4 - 6.1 mmol/l) since patient's&#xD;
      admission to operating room. Samplings will be taken in 1 to 4 hours intervals in accordance&#xD;
      with glycemia stability and MPC algorithm suggestions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B = Group of standard glycemia control: blood glucose level will be maintained by continuous&#xD;
      insulin infusion (see above) within normoglycemia limits (4.4 - 6.1 mmol/l) after patient's&#xD;
      admission to ICU after cardiac surgery. During surgery hyperglycemia will not be interfered&#xD;
      before it will reach level of 10 mmol/l, then i.v. bolus of 1-2 IU of rapid-acting insulin&#xD;
      was administered in order to keep glucose values under this threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection: demographic and clinical characteristics, BMI, standard laboratory findings,&#xD;
      perioperative organ complications (respiratory, renal, hematologic, immunologic, infection,&#xD;
      wound healing), weaning from ventilatory support, use of catecholamine, in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality, scoring (Euroscore, TISS 28, APACHE II, SAPS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The answer the question when is the optimal time to start glycemia control in patients with&#xD;
      in advance known beginning of acute stress reaction would give us a chance, if our hypothesis&#xD;
      will be confirmed, to block on time negative effects of hyperglycemia and thereby to decrease&#xD;
      number of postoperative organ complications, what would have a significant importance not&#xD;
      only medical, but also socio-economical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also further eMPC improvement based on clinical data from this study will give to&#xD;
      intensivists instrument for markedly simpler and mainly more accurate glycemia normalization&#xD;
      and glycemia control in critically ill patients then recent glycemia protocols enable.&#xD;
