      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Formaldehyde has many uses in industry and medicine. However, exposure to formaldehyde has&#xD;
      been associated with increased risk for myeloid leukemia. There are still questions about how&#xD;
      the chemical reacts with bone marrow to increase this cancer risk. Some smaller studies have&#xD;
      looked at how it affects stem cells, which are found in bone marrow. Researchers want to&#xD;
      develop a much larger study of workers in China. The study will look at different levels of&#xD;
      formaldehyde exposure. It will focus on how the chemical affects the blood cells and bone&#xD;
      marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the effects of formaldehyde exposure on blood cells and bone marrow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 60 years of age who work in selected factories in Guangdong&#xD;
      Province, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will also&#xD;
           be screened with a work history. Those who have been exposed to benzene, butadiene,&#xD;
           styrene, or radiation will not be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be studied based on their regular formaldehyde exposure level.&#xD;
           One-third will be those exposed to more than 1 part per million (ppm) of the chemical.&#xD;
           One-third will be those exposed to 0.3 to 1 ppm. A control group will have no exposure&#xD;
           to formaldehyde or any other known toxic chemical.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide blood and cheek swab samples. They will also answer questions&#xD;
           about their work habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To look at chemical exposure levels, participants will wear a small monitor to work on 3&#xD;
           different days. They may provide additional blood and cell samples as directed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Research in industrial workers and professionals exposed to formaldehyde suggests that&#xD;
      occupational exposure to this important chemical is associated with increased risk for&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia. However, there is still uncertainty about the biologic plausibility of the&#xD;
      association because of questions regarding the ability of formaldehyde, which is extremely&#xD;
      reactive, to directly or indirectly cause toxicity to the bone marrow. There have been&#xD;
      several relatively small studies of the impact of occupational formaldehyde exposure on&#xD;
      peripheral blood cells that found some evidence that peripheral blood cells of the myeloid&#xD;
      lineage (i.e., granulocytes, platelets) were significantly decreased in exposed workers. We&#xD;
      propose to follow-up these findings in a relatively large study population in China. We will&#xD;
      study hematologic parameters in 240 higher exposed workers (&gt;1 ppm), 240 workers exposed to&#xD;
      lower levels of formaldehyde (0.3 to 1 ppm), and a group of 240 unexposed controls&#xD;
      frequency-matched to exposed workers. This study will make an important contribution to our&#xD;
      understanding of the leukemogenic potential of formaldehyde, which has important public&#xD;
      health and regulatory implications.&#xD;

        We will identify formaldehyde-exposed manufacturing workers during the cross-sectional&#xD;
        study. The exposed workers have to have held the same job for at least 3 months in the same&#xD;
        factory. We expect that the age and sex distribution will be similar in the lower and&#xD;
        higher exposed workers. We will enroll controls without previous occupational exposure to&#xD;
        formaldehyde or any other genotoxic, hematotoxic or immunotoxic chemicals in two factories&#xD;
        that manufacture clothes located in the same@@@geographic area as the utensil producing&#xD;
        factories.&#xD;
