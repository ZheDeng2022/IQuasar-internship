  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, randomized withdrawal study comparing CNV1014802 with placebo in&#xD;
      patients with trigeminal neuralgia who have successfully responded to CNV1014802 in an&#xD;
      initial open-label phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will participate in an initial open-label treatment period of 21 days of CNV1014802&#xD;
      150mg three times a day (tid). Responders will be randomized to 28 days of CNV1014802 150mg&#xD;
      tid or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following an interim analysis after 10 evaluable patients have completed the open-label&#xD;
      phase, the dose regimen may be increased to 350mg twice a day (bid) for the remainder of the&#xD;
      trial if the responder rate is less than 60%.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In order to be randomised and enter the double-blind placebo controlled phase of the study,&#xD;
      patients must satisfy at least one of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30% or more decrease in number of paroxysms (either spontaneous, evoked, or both)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  30% reduction in the severity of pain experienced during the paroxysm (either&#xD;
           spontaneous, evoked or both)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Patient Global Improvement of Change rating of much improved/very much improved The&#xD;
           response will be compared with the baseline recordings of pain made in the 7 day run-in&#xD;
           period. If a patient meets one of these criteria they are termed a responder, and will&#xD;
           be eligible to be randomized into the double-blind treatment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the double-blind randomised phase, patients will be evaluated to determine if they&#xD;
      meet the failure criteria at each clinic visit which will occur every 7 days in the&#xD;
      double-blind treatment period. The number of failures on CNV1014802 versus number of failures&#xD;
      on placebo during the double-blind treatment period will be the primary outcome of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be classified as a treatment failure if they meet one of the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50% increase in the frequency of paroxysms compared to the final 7 days of the&#xD;
           open-label period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  50% increase in the severity of pain experienced in the paroxysms compared to the final&#xD;
           7 days of the open-label period&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Patient Global Improvement of Change rating of much worse/very much worse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient discontinues the study due to 'Lack of Efficacy'&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient discontinues due to an adverse reaction or poor tolerability considered to&#xD;
           be related to study medication&#xD;
