    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of PI3K inhibitor BKM120 when given&#xD;
      together with docetaxel in treating patients with advanced solid tumor that is locally&#xD;
      advanced, cannot be removed by surgery, or metastatic. PI3K inhibitor BKM120 may stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as docetaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells,&#xD;
      either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving PI3K inhibitor BKM120&#xD;
      together with docetaxel may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the dose-limiting toxicities and identify the recommended phase II dose of&#xD;
      the combination of docetaxel and BKM 120 (P13K inhibitor BKM120) in patients with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety and tolerability of this combination. III. To determine any&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic (PK) interaction between BKM12O and docetaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess any preliminary evidence of efficacy with this combination in patients with&#xD;
      advanced cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha&#xD;
      (PIK3CA) mutations as predictive biomarkers of efficacy for the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate PIK3CA polymorphisms and polymorphisms in BKM120 transport and metabolism as&#xD;
      predictors of toxicity and/or efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of PI3K inhibitor BKM120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive PI3K inhibitor BKM120 orally (PO) once daily (QD) and docetaxel&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 courses&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;

             as either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  True abstinence: when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the subject; periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Use of a combination of any two of the following (a+b):&#xD;

                       suppository&#xD;
&#xD;
