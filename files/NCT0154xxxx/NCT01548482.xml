  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and the best dose of trebananib and temsirolimus&#xD;
      when given together in treating patients with solid tumors that are metastatic or cannot be&#xD;
      removed by surgery. Trebananib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking blood flow to&#xD;
      the tumor. Temsirolimus may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth. Giving trebananib with temsirolimus may be an effective treatment for&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile of AMG 386&#xD;
      (trebananib) in combination with temsirolimus in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate pharmacodynamic (PD) effects of both drugs when administered in combination,&#xD;
      with the goal of identifying potential predictive and PD markers that need further&#xD;
      exploration and validation in future trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore preliminary anti-tumor activity of both drugs when administered at the RP2D to&#xD;
      patients with advanced endometrial cancer, renal cell carcinoma, or carcinoid tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of trebananib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive trebananib intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes and temsirolimus IV over 30-60&#xD;
      minutes on days 1, 8, 15, and 22. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for 30 days.&#xD;
