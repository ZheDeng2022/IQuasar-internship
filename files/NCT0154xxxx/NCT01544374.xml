      Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in women. Black women are less&#xD;
      likely than white women to develop breast cancer but, they are more likely to die of the&#xD;
      disease. Some of this survival discrepancy is likely due to underuse of adjuvant therapies&#xD;
      proven to increase survival. Breast cancer treatment often requires coordination among&#xD;
      surgeons, pathologists, primary care physicians, medical and radiation oncologists. In NYC,&#xD;
      black and Hispanic women who accessed care and underwent surgical treatment of their breast&#xD;
      cancer were twice as likely as whites to experience underuse of adjuvant treatment.&#xD;
      Disturbingly, 1/3 of these underuse cases were episodes in which the surgeon recommended&#xD;
      treatment, the patient did not refuse and yet, care did not ensue. Underuse in such&#xD;
      circumstances is attributable to system failures than to specific provider or patient&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed randomized controlled trial, the investigators aim to test the effectiveness&#xD;
      of a Tracking and Feedback (T&amp;F) registry innovation to increase rates of completed oncology&#xD;
      consultation and reduce both underuse of needed adjuvant therapy and racial disparities in&#xD;
      receipt of these treatments. The investigators also aim to assess the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing a T&amp;F Registry in these high-risk hospitals by evaluating implementation&#xD;
      effectiveness for that innovation. The investigators have recruited 10 hospitals that serve&#xD;
      large proportions of minority women with breast cancer. The investigators will randomize&#xD;
      hospitals and aim to recruit 354 women with a new breast cancer, 177 per intervention arm.&#xD;
      The investigators choose these &quot;high risk&quot; hospitals because they serve predominantly&#xD;
      minority populations, and such hospitals have higher rates of the system failure cause of&#xD;
      underuse, and particularly, the type of underuse targeted by our Tracking and Feedback&#xD;
      Registry.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is the second most common cause of cancer death in women. Black women are less&#xD;
      likely than white women to develop breast cancer but, they are more likely to die of the&#xD;
      disease. Some of this survival discrepancy is likely due to underuse of adjuvant therapies&#xD;
      proven to increase survival. Breast cancer treatment often requires coordination among&#xD;
      surgeons, pathologists, primary care physicians, medical and radiation oncologists. In NYC,&#xD;
      black and Hispanic women who accessed care and underwent surgical treatment of their breast&#xD;
      cancer were twice as likely as whites to experience underuse of proven-effective adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment. Disturbingly, 1/3 of these underuse cases were episodes in which the surgeon&#xD;
      recommended treatment, the patient did not refuse and yet, care did not ensue. Underuse in&#xD;
      these circumstances was attributed to system failures rather than to provider or patient&#xD;
      factors. Such system failures occurred more often among minority women and among women&#xD;
      treated at hospitals serving predominantly minority patients. To target these system failures&#xD;
      at 6 NYC hospitals, 4 of which served predominantly minority patients, we used a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental pre-post test design to implement a tracking and feedback registry. The&#xD;
      Tracking and Feedback registry closed the referral loop between surgeons and oncologists,&#xD;
      increased the rate of completed oncology consultations, increased treatment rates and&#xD;
      eliminated the racial disparity in underuse. Its effects were greatest at the 4 hospitals&#xD;
      serving predominantly minority women, sites that had an EMR and patient navigation prior to&#xD;
      and during the T&amp;F implementation. However, the trial was not randomized, tracking and&#xD;
      feedback functions were performed by study personnel and not embedded in the hospital's&#xD;
      workflow and details of what the surgeons did in response to the feedback was not assessed,&#xD;
      resulting in a call for more work in this area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposed randomized controlled trial, we will implement the Tracking and Feedback&#xD;
      (T&amp;F) innovation in hospitals serving predominantly minority women. We will test the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the Tracking and Feedback registry innovation to increase rates of completed&#xD;
      oncology consultation, reduce underuse of needed adjuvant therapy and racial disparities in&#xD;
      receipt of these treatments. We will also assess the feasibility of implementing a T&amp;F&#xD;
      Registry in these high-risk hospitals by evaluating implementation effectiveness for this&#xD;
      innovation. We have recruited 10 hospitals that serve large proportions of minority women&#xD;
      with breast cancer. We will randomize hospitals and will recruit 354 women with a new breast&#xD;
      cancer, 177 per intervention arm. We choose these &quot;high risk&quot; hospitals because they serve&#xD;
      predominantly minority populations, and such hospitals have higher rates of the system&#xD;
      failure cause of underuse, specifically, the type of underuse targeted by our Tracking and&#xD;
      Feedback Registry. We will: adapt existing laptop-based Tracking &amp; Feedback software to&#xD;
      create a protected web-based format easily accessible to all participating hospitals; tailor&#xD;
      the Tracking &amp; Feedback registry to each of the participating hospitals' appropriate&#xD;
      workflows including the areas of pathology, surgery, medical and radiation oncology and tumor&#xD;
      registry personnel in the process; and embed the tracking and feedback tasks within existing&#xD;
      hospital structures and personnel to increase likelihood of sustainability beyond the grant.&#xD;
      We will include in the web-based T&amp;F Registry an electronic data capture system to assess&#xD;
      responses and actions to the tracking information that is fed back to the surgeons. To assess&#xD;
      the T&amp;F Registry's effectiveness, we will compare rates of underuse of patients treated at&#xD;
      intervention versus control hospitals. To assess implementation effectiveness at each&#xD;
      hospital, we will assess process and outcomes using qualitative and quantitative methods.&#xD;
      Qualitatively, we will conduct pre- &amp; post-intervention interviews with key stakeholders to&#xD;
      assess the implementation climate and stakeholders' views of the Registry's utility.&#xD;
      Quantitatively, we will measure and track actions taken in response to the feedback&#xD;
      information. As there is variability across hospitals, we will also assess each hospital's&#xD;
      treatment rates both pre- (N=540) and post-intervention (N=354) to provide additional&#xD;
      quantitative measures of implementation effectiveness.&#xD;
