          -  Subject has a confirmed diagnosis of cystic fibrosis documented by a compatible&#xD;
             clinical or radiographic presentation, and definitive accepted lab and clinical&#xD;
             criteria (e.g., sweat chloride &gt; 60 mEq/L or 2 disease causing CFTR mutations) OR is&#xD;
             regularly attending a Consultant led clinic where the diagnosis of Cystic Fibrosis is&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subject has an oxygen saturation &gt;92% on room air as determined by pulse oximetry at&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a non-smoker or ex-smoker has not smoked for at least six months prior to&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is otherwise medically stable without clinically significant abnormal&#xD;
             screening results that depart from their usual baseline level of health as a subject&#xD;
             with CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be willing and able to communicate in English and participate in the whole study.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has unstable lung disease, as defined by a change in medical regimen during&#xD;

             lobar/segmental collapse), or in the opinion of the Investigator, has had a decline in&#xD;
             pulmonary status within the last year not considered a part of the usual, chronic&#xD;
