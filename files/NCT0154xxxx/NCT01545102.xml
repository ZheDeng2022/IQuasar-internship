      Cardiac rehabilitation is the ideal comprehensive intervention for patients with chronic&#xD;
      heart failure (CHF), since it addresses the complex interplay of medical, psychological and&#xD;
      behavioural factors facing these individuals. Structured exercise training within a cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme is firmly recommended for these patients. However, it is&#xD;
      questionable whether patients are achieving an adequate dose of exercise to provide optimal&#xD;
      benefits. The essential components for setting optimal training include the appropriate mode,&#xD;
      duration, frequency and intensity of exercise. UK surveys of cardiac rehabilitation describe&#xD;
      the frequency and duration of training, but here is scant information on exercise intensity.&#xD;
      However, it is apparent that randomised controlled trials of exercise training use doses more&#xD;
      than 4 times greater than in UK current practice. The Eastbourne Exercise Cardiology Research&#xD;
      Group has demonstrated that although patients benefit from improved quality of life and&#xD;
      submaximal fitness after a hospital outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme, they do not&#xD;
      achieve the increases in important prognostic indicators reported by the majority of exercise&#xD;
      training trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The critical factor in terms of eliciting a sufficient training effect while minimising risk&#xD;
      is the intensity of the exercise performed. It is now widely accepted that the traditional&#xD;
      methods of using fixed percentages of maximal heart rate or oxygen uptake to set exercise&#xD;
      intensity include serious errors. The European Society of Cardiology recommends that&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise testing should be used to provide an objective evaluation of the&#xD;
      metabolic demand of exercise. This allows physiologically meaningful reference points to be&#xD;
      established for aerobic exercise prescription and is the solution to defining safe and&#xD;
      effective training intensities. The next step is to determine whether this information can be&#xD;
      transferred to a practical cardiac rehabilitation environment to set and monitor exercise&#xD;
      intensity&#xD;

      Background Heart failure is a chronic, costly and life-threatening disorder that constitutes&#xD;
      a significant burden for individuals and the National Health Service [There are 27,000 new&#xD;
      cases reported per annum in the UK. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is recommended as the ideal&#xD;
      comprehensive intervention since it addresses the complex interplay of medical, psychological&#xD;
      and behavioural factors facing CHF patients and carers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim Primary objective to describe the exercise intensity, defined by oxygen uptake&#xD;
      (VO2) in terms of the individual physiological thresholds, in CHF patients undergoing CR&#xD;
      according to current guidelines Primary end point: VO2 Secondary objectives Secondary&#xD;
      objectives of this study are:-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure resting and exercising energy expenditure in order to a) establish the value&#xD;
           of 1 MET (resting metabolic rate) for patients with CHF, and b) to establish the MET&#xD;
           value (defined as multiples of resting metabolic rate) for exercises performed in CR&#xD;
           sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure affective responses (feeling very bad - feeling very good; levels of energy -&#xD;
           tiredness and tension - calmness) to exercise during CR sessions&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To measure weekly physical activity level in CHF patients undergoing Phase III and IV&#xD;
           CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary analysis the following secondary end points and parameters will be&#xD;
      established&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MET values, defined as multiples of resting oxygen uptake or resting metabolic rate (1&#xD;
           MET), for different CR exercises&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ratings of affective response on the Feelings Scale (FS) and ratings of perceived&#xD;
           activation on the Felt Arousal Scale (FAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Average daily activity over 7 day period in terms of steps per day and periods spent&#xD;
           sitting, standing and walking&#xD;
