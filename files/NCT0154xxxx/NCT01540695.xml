    <textblock>
      This prospective study of 60 slides of basal and squamous cell carcinomas of the skin aims to&#xD;
      determine whether:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The process of cryofixation prior to generating formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)&#xD;
           H&amp;E sections alters the histology in skin tumor specimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Which specific histologic parameters are altered between previously cryofixed versus&#xD;
           routine FFPE sections. Histologic observations will be recorded by two&#xD;
           dermatopathologists and two Mohs surgeons and statistically analyzed.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Generating formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained&#xD;
      permanent sections from previously cryofixed tissue is a common practice used to confirm&#xD;
      diagnosis of frozen section histology. In dermatology, this practice can be used to examine&#xD;
      Mohs layers and its debulk as well as routine nonmelanoma skin cancer (NMSC) biopsies after&#xD;
      initial histologic diagnosis with frozen sections. Even though freezing tissue can introduce&#xD;
      histologic artifacts, there have been no studies documenting whether this occurs specifically&#xD;
      in cryofixed tissues that are subsequently thawed for permanent FFPE H&amp;E histology. The&#xD;
      purpose of our study is to determine whether the freeze-thaw process used to generate&#xD;
      permanent sections after cryofixation introduces significantly detectable histologic&#xD;
      differences compared to permanent sections that were not previously cryofixed. Thirty debulk&#xD;
      specimens of basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas will be prospectively collected. Each&#xD;
      specimen will be split so that half is processed as cryofixed permanents and the other half&#xD;
      as noncryofixed permanents. The investigator will show each slide in random order to a group&#xD;
      of four blinded participants (two dermatopathologists and two Mohs surgeons). Each&#xD;
      participant must first rate the overall quality of histology. Then, each participant will&#xD;
      rate each slide on the quality of cellular morphology, nuclear morphology, color and contrast&#xD;
      of stains, intactness of specimen, and other miscellaneous artifacts. These data will then be&#xD;
      analyzed for statistical significance.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients (age 18 or over) with a biopsy proven routine basal cell or squamous&#xD;
             cell carcinoma of the skin who are scheduled for treatment with the Mohs procedure by&#xD;
             Dr. Christopher Miller at the University of Pennsylvania's Division of Dermatologic&#xD;
             Surgery will be included. Both female and male patients will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with basal cell or squamous cell carcinomas of more complex histopathology&#xD;
             will be excluded from the study. Complex histopathology of a tumor is defined as&#xD;
             features with aggressive, moderately to poorly differentiated, or unusual&#xD;
             histopathology.&#xD;
