      This study is being done to find out if transperineal ultrasound (TPUS) can help define the&#xD;
      prostate gland for radiation treatment planning and improve upon current methods of image&#xD;
      guidance for the treatment of prostate cancer. For the patient, TPUS involves the placement&#xD;
      of an ultrasound probe on the perineum, the skin between the scrotum and anus, while they are&#xD;
      lying on their back in the position they will receive their treatment. Image-guidance is&#xD;
      required for the treatment of prostate cancer because the prostate shifts position depending&#xD;
      on how full the bladder and rectum are. Image-guided radiation therapy has been done at&#xD;
      Fletcher Allen Health Care for approximately three years. Most commonly, transabdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound images are obtained every day and compared to an ultrasound that was done on the&#xD;
      day of treatment planning. Adjustments in radiation field position can be done on a daily&#xD;
      basis by comparing these images. Transperineal ultrasound has never been used for&#xD;
      image-guidance. The investigators completed an earlier study and have developed a TPUS device&#xD;
      and process that allow us to get clear ultrasound pictures of the prostate gland. The TPUS&#xD;
      has three potential advantages over the transabdominal method the investigators currently&#xD;
      use:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Transabdominal ultrasound can be a challenge for some men. A full bladder helps us get&#xD;
           clearer images, however it is difficult for some men with prostate cancer to comfortably&#xD;
           keep a full bladder. It is also particularly difficult to get good images in larger men&#xD;
           who have long distances from the skin surface to the prostate gland. TPUS is not&#xD;
           dependent on a man having a full bladder and should be less dependent on the size of the&#xD;
           man.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. TPUS images and the planning CT images can be acquired simultaneously. This is not&#xD;
           possible with the abdominal probe because it gets in the way of the CT machine.&#xD;
           Simultaneous imaging eliminates the possibility of the prostate gland shifting positions&#xD;
           during the time between imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. TPUS can be in place and acquire images during patient treatment (the abdominal probe&#xD;
           gets in the way of the treatment machine) and may in the future allow us to watch the&#xD;
           prostate gland during treatment. If the investigators discover that they can accurately&#xD;
           view the prostate gland in real time, TPUS may ultimately allow us to treat even smaller&#xD;
           radiation fields and possibly decrease the risk of radiation complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in this study will be treated for their prostate cancer with the standard image&#xD;
      guidance techniques used at Fletcher Allen Health Care: transabdominal ultrasound and/or&#xD;
      X-ray imaging of gold marker seeds that have been placed the prostate gland. In addition to&#xD;
      standard care, all men in this study will have TPUS and CT scans done a total of four times&#xD;
      over 12 weeks to compare these methods of prostate localization over the course of radiation&#xD;
      treatments. Some men may choose to take part in an additional study that will also include&#xD;
      MRI of the pelvis to compare with the TPUS and CT. Because the prostate gland can be more&#xD;
      clearly defined on MRI, some institutions (not Fletcher Allen) routinely have patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer get MRI scans for treatment planning. This has not been proven to improve the&#xD;
      care of men with prostate cancer and it is possible that TPUS will provide similarly clear&#xD;
      images. The potential advantages to TPUS imaging for prostate localization over MRI include&#xD;
      the fact that it is done at the same time as the CT for treatment planning (so eliminates the&#xD;
      possibility of movement of the prostate gland from the time of the MRI to the time of the CT)&#xD;
      and can be done at a much lower cost.&#xD;
