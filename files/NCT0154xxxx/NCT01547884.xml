      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Lymphatic filariasis is an infection that is caused by small, thread-like worms. It is&#xD;
      spread by mosquitoes, and causes fever, chills, and headaches. If untreated, it can also&#xD;
      cause elephantiasis, a condition that leads to swelling of the arms, legs, breasts, and&#xD;
      scrotum. Treatment can eliminate the worms from the blood and reduce the risk of developing&#xD;
      elephantiasis. Researchers want to study people with latent tuberculosis (TB) who may or may&#xD;
      not be infected with filariasis. This study will look at the way that people with latent TB&#xD;
      fight infection with these worms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how the immune systems of people with latent TB react to filarial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 65 years of age who have latent TB and may or may not have&#xD;
      filarial infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. They will&#xD;
           provide a blood and stool sample to test for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who do not have lymphatic filariasis but have another kind of intestinal&#xD;
           worm will be treated for the parasite. This will be their last study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who have latent TB and lymphatic filariasis will be treated with the&#xD;
           standard treatment for the disease. They will come back for a second visit 6 months&#xD;
           later, and will provide another blood sample.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tissue-invasive helminth parasites infect close to 500 million people worldwide and are&#xD;
      associated with strong T helper (Th)2 responses and regulatory networks that downregulate&#xD;
      potentially protective Th1 responses. The two common tissue invasive helminth parasites are&#xD;
      Wuchereria bancrofti, that causes lymphatic filariasis and Strongyloides stercoralis, that&#xD;
      causes stronyloidiasis. Previous studies have shown that the intestinal helminth coinfection&#xD;
      is accompanied by lowered in vitro production of interferon-gamma and elevated production of&#xD;
      interleukin 10 in individuals with active pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). Our team has recently&#xD;
      shown that co-existent filarial TB infections down-regulate Th1 and Th17 responses, which are&#xD;
      necessary for protection against active TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will compare immune responses to mycobacterial antigens in individuals with&#xD;
      latent tuberculosis (LTBI+) and concomitant helminth infection (Hel+), including those with&#xD;
      filarial (Fil+) and strongyloides (STR+) infection versus those with LTBI+ without&#xD;
      concomitant helminth infection (Hel-). Immune responses to mycobacterial antigens from&#xD;
      co-infected individuals will also be evaluated before and after treatment for helminth&#xD;
      infection. Individuals (n=4000) will sign a screening consent prior to undergoing any study&#xD;
      procedures. Every participant will have their medical history collected and will undergo a&#xD;
      physical exam and a tuberculin 2TU purified protein derivative (PPD) skin test; women of&#xD;
      childbearing potential will also undergo a urine pregnancy test, and those with positive test&#xD;
      results will be excluded from the study. Individuals with positive PPD skin test results (&gt;&#xD;
      or = 5 mm) and no symptoms of active TB will have their blood drawn (5 mL) as part of the&#xD;
      screening procedures to confirm LTBI+ status, evaluate circulating filarial antigenemia,&#xD;
      determine Strongyloides status by ELISA, measure hematocrit levels, and for storage of serum&#xD;
      samples; those with PPD skin test results less than or equal to 5 mm will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study. Individuals with positive symptoms for TB will also be excluded from the study,&#xD;
      but sputum will be collected from them, and those with positive smears will be referred for&#xD;
      treatment. Individuals will be matched for age, gender, and geographic location, and they&#xD;
      will be assigned to one of two groups, LTBI+ Hel+ (n=100) or LTBI+ Hel- (n=100).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 3 months of screening, individuals will be asked to sign an on-study consent and will&#xD;
      undergo a second blood draw (10 mL) for immunological investigations and storage of serum&#xD;
      samples; women of childbearing potential will undergo a repeat urine pregnancy test, and&#xD;
      those with positive test results will be excluded from further study. Stool samples will also&#xD;
      be collected for microscopic evaluation of ova and parasites. LTBI+ Fil+ individuals will be&#xD;
      treated with a single standard dose of albendazole (400 mg) and single standard dose of&#xD;
      diethylcarbamazine citrate (300 mg), which are available through the National Programme for&#xD;
      the Elimination of Lymphatic Filariasis in India. LTBI+ STR+ individuals will be treated with&#xD;
      a single standard dose of ivermectin (12mg) and a single standard dose of albendazole&#xD;
      (400mg). These individuals will be asked to return 6 months after treatment to undergo a&#xD;
      third blood draw (10 mL) for additional immunological investigations and storage of serum&#xD;
      samples. LTBI+ Hel-individuals who test positive for other intestinal helminth infection will&#xD;
      be treated with a single standard dose of albendazole (400 mg).&#xD;

        The screening will be a community-based study in South India. Study participants will be&#xD;
        recruited from villages in the Kancheepuram District, where approximately 6% of the&#xD;
        population tests positive for circulating filarial antigens [31]. PPD skin test reactivity&#xD;
        in this population is virtually 100% to PPD-B (battery) and 60% to 70% to PPD-S (standard)&#xD;
        by age 24, and the incidence of active TB is about 4 per 1000 individuals [31]. While the&#xD;
        rate of positivity of the tuberculin skin test to the 2TU PPD test is not known,&#xD;
        significant deviation in the percent positivity from skin tests using 1TU is not expected&#xD;
        based on findings reported elsewhere [32]. However, we are revising the @@@screening sample&#xD;
        number on the basis of preliminary data from the current study that shows that the&#xD;
        prevalence of latent TB in this population is around 25% and filariasis is around 1%. In&#xD;
        addition, preliminary data from these areas show that the prevalence of Stronglyloides&#xD;
        infection is around 10%.&#xD;

        -  PARTICIPANT INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals (18 to 65 years of age) who meet the following criteria are eligible to&#xD;
        participate in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive tuberculin PPD skin test result (&gt;or equal to 5 mm) and IGRA+.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to provide blood and stool samples for examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to have samples stored for study participants only.&#xD;
&#xD;
        PARTICIPANT EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Individuals are not eligible to participate if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pulmonary symptoms suggestive of TB (cough &gt;3 weeks in duration and/or intermittent&#xD;
             fever &gt;1 week in duration and/or hemoptysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tuberculin skin test within the last 6 months prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known documented cases of cancer, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of any other illness or condition which, in the investigator s judgment, may&#xD;
             substantially increase the risk associated with the subject s participation in the&#xD;
             protocol, or it may compromise the scientific objectives.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consumption of DEC in the last one year prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION OF PREGNANT WOMEN:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy: Pregnant and lactating women will be excluded from the study because the&#xD;
             safety of DEC or ivermectin has not been adequately evaluated during pregnancy or&#xD;
             lactation, while albendazole is a Category C drug found to be teratogenic in animals,&#xD;
             and it poses a potential risk during breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  EXCLUSION OF CHILDREN: Children (&lt;18 years of age) will not be included in this study&#xD;
             due to the fact the prevalence of filarial and strongyloides infection in children has&#xD;
             been found to be very low in South India.&#xD;
