    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the effectiveness and safety of the drug Gleevec&#xD;
      (imatinib) as a new treatment for patients with active diffuse scleroderma. This drug has not&#xD;
      been used previously to treat scleroderma, but it has been found to advance the treatment and&#xD;
      life span of patients with a type of leukemia called chronic myeloid leukemia or CML. Gleevec&#xD;
      acts on chemical signals in the cells that may decrease fibrosis (the hardening of the skin&#xD;
      that occurs in scleroderma). It works by interfering in the process that activates many&#xD;
      molecules that cause fibrosis, including TGFbeta (which may be a key part of disease activity&#xD;
      in scleroderma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study proposes to treat patients that have significant diffuse scleroderma with Gleevec&#xD;
      for 6 months and investigate several measures of scleroderma disease activity before, during&#xD;
      and at the end of treatment (0, 3 months and 6 months). This is a randomized, double blind,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled trial: 20 patients will be divided into two groups in a 4:1 ratio, with 16&#xD;
      patients taking 400mg of Gleevec per day and 4 taking a placebo. The differences between the&#xD;
      groups that will be measured include safety, Modified Rodnan skin score (mRSS), Health&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), global assessments (100mm VAS) and changes in biomarkers in&#xD;
      blood and skin biopsies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scleroderma is a connective tissue disease that is prototypical for fibrosis with&#xD;
      autoantibodies and vascular abnormalities including vasomotor instability (Raynaud's) at one&#xD;
      end and blood vessel obliteration at the other (1,2). Scleroderma occurs in &gt; 2/10,000 (with&#xD;
      thousands of Canadians affected) and has no proven therapy to modify the disease overall (3).&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the potential of Gleevec to be used as a novel&#xD;
      therapy in the treatment of scleroderma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are two subtypes of systemic scleroderma: diffuse and limited (2). Limited skin&#xD;
      involvement includes skin involvement distal to the elbows and knees and may include the neck&#xD;
      and face, but spares the trunk and proximal extremities. Diffuse scleroderma has more&#xD;
      extensive skin involvement including trunk or proximal extremities and is associated with&#xD;
      more internal organ involvement and increased mortality (4). For instance, significant&#xD;
      interstitial lung disease, cardiomyopathy and scleroderma renal crisis are more common in&#xD;
      diffuse scleroderma than limited. The extent of organ involvement in these areas may&#xD;
      correlate with the extent of skin involvement and worsening skin involvement is associated&#xD;
      with increased mortality and worse overall health function as measured by the Health&#xD;
      Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Formulation of Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various signals that could be therapeutically down regulated in scleroderma such as PDGF,&#xD;
      VEGF, endothelin, and TGFβ are potential therapeutic targets. The inhibition of tyrosine&#xD;
      kinase can decrease cell growth and could be a key signal modifier in scleroderma (6). Signal&#xD;
      transduction modification with selected targets has been very successful in the treatment of&#xD;
      some cancers, such as using Gleevec in chronic myelocytic leukemia (7).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gleevec (imatinib) is an oral tyrosine kinase inhibitor. It is used in the treatment of CML&#xD;
      and some GI stromal tumors, with a reduction in mortality in CML. Tyrosine kinase activates&#xD;
      PDGF and TGFbeta, which are key signals in scleroderma so a proof of concept study is needed&#xD;
      to determine if there is a biological signal to proceed in a disease of fibrosis such as&#xD;
      scleroderma. PDGF regulation is important in fibrotic diseases by stimulating replication and&#xD;
      migration of myofibroblasts (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with active diffuse scleroderma will be enrolled after consenting and will receive&#xD;
      Gleevec 400mg/od or placebo. Serum and skin biopsies will be collected for biomarkers. Serum&#xD;
      samples will be taken at baseline, 3 and 6 months and analyzed by ELISA/multiplexing for&#xD;
      changes in profibrotic cytokines including PDGF, VEGF, endothelin, and TGFβ. Skin biopsies&#xD;
      will be taken prior to the first dose and at 6 months. Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS),&#xD;
      Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ), MD and patient global assessments will also be done at&#xD;
      times 0, 3, and 6 months. SF36 and Health Transition Score will be done at 0 and 6 months.&#xD;
      Biochemistry for safety and inflammation will be done once a month for the duration of the&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gleevec at 400 mg/od or placebo will be given orally with food and a large glass of water for&#xD;
      6 months. As this is a proof of concept and Phase IIa trial they will be randomized into&#xD;
      active vs. placebo groups in a 4:1 ratio, where n=20. Therefore, 16 patients will receive&#xD;
      active drug and 4 will receive placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcome measurement: changes in cytokine expression in skin biopsies and serum&#xD;
           samples for profibrotic cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the between groups differences from baseline to final skin score on Gleevec&#xD;
           and placebo at 6 months using the Modified Rodnan Skin Score (MRSS).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the AEs (adverse events) and SAEs (serious adverse events) between the&#xD;
           groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Secondary objectives will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparing secondary outcome measurements such as: MD global, patient global, HAQ, SF36,&#xD;
      Health Transition, ESR, CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization will be stratified by current use of methotrexate. It is anticipated that&#xD;
      the majority of patients in this trial will not be taking methotrexate at time of&#xD;
      randomization, but stratification should balance the groups if there is a heterogenous&#xD;
      response. The randomization will be done in balanced blocks of 5, after stratification by&#xD;
      methotrexate use. The pharmacy will be called and will provide the medication and will have&#xD;
      the randomization code. The trial is blinded where the patient, the research nurse performing&#xD;
      study procedures including dispensing the study drug, and the physician doing the outcome&#xD;
      assessments will all be unaware of treatment allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant Medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stable dose concomitant methotrexate of up to 25 mg/week if tolerated (po or sc) can be&#xD;
      continued throughout the study. In addition, if necessary, folate can be added or increased&#xD;
      to decrease side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All standard of care is allowed except for the medications listed above. Thus treatment for&#xD;
      GERD, Raynaud's, digital ulcers, HTN, delayed GI emptying, small bowel overgrowth, Sjogren's&#xD;
      symptoms, arthritis (using NSAIDs or low dose prednisone) is allowed. Severe PAH and severe&#xD;
      ILD is excluded as there could be expectations that this comorbidity may interfere with the&#xD;
      current 24-week treatment protocol. Steroids can be increased in the rare chance that a&#xD;
      patient develops a complication or co-morbidity that requires higher doses of steroids as&#xD;
      part of standard care. Regular need for antibiotics for small bowel overgrowth is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good clinical practice will be followed and other appropriate treatment will not be denied.&#xD;
      This is an 'add-on' treatment to standard care. Concomitant medications will be assumed to be&#xD;
      held stable throughout the study. Patients taking any medications that may interact with&#xD;
      Gleevec (eg. SSRIs, TCA, trazadone, benzodiazepines, betablockers, etc.) will be monitored&#xD;
      cautiously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since Gleevec has been postulated (by a case report) to improve pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH) annual echocardiograms that are done as part of standard care may be&#xD;
      compared between the groups determining the estimated PAP on echocardiogram (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      AEs and SAEs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The University of Western Ontario Ethics Committee will approve the protocol and any&#xD;
      amendments and will be informed of any SAEs as per usual research conduct. The patients are&#xD;
      free to withdraw consent or drop out at any time with no adverse effect on their future care.&#xD;
      As per any trial, AEs and SAEs will be collected. SAEs will be reported in an expedited way&#xD;
      to the UWO Ethics Committee and Novartis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy or fathering of a child, although not itself a serious adverse event, should also&#xD;
      be reported on a serious adverse event form or pregnancy form and be followed up to determine&#xD;
      outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and the presence&#xD;
      or absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities. In addition to any pregnancy or&#xD;
      fathering of a child within 84 days (12 weeks or 3 months) after the last Gleevec intake has&#xD;
      to be reported and recorded as an SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any pregnancy that occurs during study participation should be reported using a Clinical&#xD;
      Trial Pregnancy Form. To ensure patient safety each pregnancy must also be reported to&#xD;
      Novartis within 24 hours of learning of its occurrence. The pregnancy should be followed up&#xD;
      to determine outcome, including spontaneous or voluntary termination, details of birth, and&#xD;
      the presence or absence of any birth defects or congenital abnormalities or maternal and&#xD;
      newborn complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be informed of the risks involved in becoming pregnant while taking Gleevec in&#xD;
      the Letter of Information and female partners of male study participants will be required to&#xD;
      read and sign a &quot;Pregnant Partner Data Release Form&quot; acknowledging that they have been&#xD;
      informed of these risks as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation of Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are free to drop out at any time. A severe allergic reaction will necessitate&#xD;
      withdrawal. If there are sustained cytopenias (WBC &lt;2.0, Hbg &lt; 8.0 or Plt &lt; 50,000) for 2&#xD;
      infusions in a row then the patient will be withdrawn. If there is a WBC &lt; 1.0 or Hbg &lt; 7.5&#xD;
      or Plt &lt; 10,000 at any time, the patient will be withdrawn. If there are sustained elevations&#xD;
      of AST/ALT twice in a row, of twice the upper limit of normal, then the methotrexate will be&#xD;
      decreased by 5 mg/week. If the elevation persists for 2 more tests, the methotrexate will be&#xD;
      held for two weeks and the liver enzymes repeated. If still elevated, the methotrexate will&#xD;
      be cut in half and if still elevated and no other concomitant meds are thought to be causing&#xD;
      the elevation, then the patient will be withdrawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a pilot and is not anticipated to have enough power to have a statistically&#xD;
      significant between groups difference on skin score. However, the effects on fibrosis and&#xD;
      other mediators in serum and tissue specimens may help to determine if a larger trial should&#xD;
      be a 'go' or 'no go'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a modified intent to treat analysis, where any patient receiving at least one&#xD;
      dose of the study drug will be analyzed, and for dropouts the last observation will be&#xD;
      carried forward (LOCF). The primary outcome measurement will be changes in profibrotic&#xD;
      cytokine expression in serum and urine samples and skin biopsies. Multiplexing will be used&#xD;
      to measure up to 30 analytes of interest in one 50ul sample of any biological fluid.&#xD;
      Statistics will include the between groups (active and placebo) difference at 24 weeks (6&#xD;
      months) in the MRSS. There will be a between groups assessment of HAQ, ESR and CRP for&#xD;
      placebo compared to Gleevec. The SF36 and Health Transition Scores will be compared using&#xD;
      paired tests. AEs and SAEs will be quantified and compared between placebo and active&#xD;
      treatment. PK and PD data will only be analyzed if there is a thought of continuing drug&#xD;
      development in this area. If the data appear to demonstrate some benefit, then a repeated&#xD;
      measures ANOVA will be done to determine if there are between groups differences at various&#xD;
      time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Board:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SAEs will be reported to the Ethics Committee and to Novartis. An independent safety&#xD;
      board blinded to treatment allocation will meet at 3 months to monitor study progress and&#xD;
      SAEs. There will be no interim analysis, as the study is not powered to do one. Safety events&#xD;
      will be collected up until one month after discontinuing study drug in all cases wherever&#xD;
      possible.&#xD;
