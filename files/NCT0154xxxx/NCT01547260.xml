      The purpose of this study is to ascertain whether treatment with lenalidomide or lenalidomide&#xD;
      in combination with gemcitabine induces modulation of immune effector functions and to&#xD;
      characterize the nature of immune functions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is characterised by aggressive growth, treatment resistance and an&#xD;
      extremely poor prognosis. In subjects with locally advanced or metastatic disease, the median&#xD;
      survival is approximately 6 - 11 months and 2 - 6 months, respectively. The currently&#xD;
      accepted treatment for this disease in EU is gemcitabine which supplanted treatment with 5-FU&#xD;
      after it was shown that median survival duration was marginally improved (4.41 and 5.65&#xD;
      months respectively, p = 0,022). The reported median survival time for subjects treated with&#xD;
      single-agent gemcitabine in randomized phase III studies ranged form 4.9 to 7.2 months.&#xD;
      Despite these improvements in the treatment of pancreatic cancer, the prognosis remains very&#xD;
      poor. Lenalidomide (Revlimid®) belongs to a proprietary class of compounds called&#xD;
      immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs). IMiDshave both immunomodulatory and anti-angiogenic&#xD;
      properties which could confer antitumour and antimetastatic effects. Lenalidomide has been&#xD;
      demonstrated to possess anti-angiogenic activity through inhibition of bFGF, VEGF and&#xD;
      TNF-alpha induced endothelial cell migration, due at least in part to inhibition of Akt&#xD;
      phosphorylation response to bFGF.In addition, lenalidomide has a variety of immunomodulatory&#xD;
      effects. Gemcitabine (Gemzar®) is a synthetic pyrimidine nucleoside analogue that is used as&#xD;
      standard treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer. Beside the cytotoxic activity of&#xD;
      gemcitabine, accumulating evidence has indicated that the product promote specific anticancer&#xD;
      immune responses that contribute to the therapeutic effects of conventional&#xD;
      therapy.Down-regulation in survival rate of pancreatic cell lines has more recently been&#xD;
      observed, when treated with lenalidomide and gemcitabine in sub-optimal concentrations.Those&#xD;
      data supports a hypothesis of a potential hyper-additive affect of the treatments given in&#xD;
      combination. Therefore lenalidomide and gemcitabine should be of major interest to explore&#xD;
      for combination therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I/II open-label, multi-center study. It will consist of a phase I&#xD;
      dose-finding part and a phase II part during which subjects will be treated at the MTD&#xD;
      established during phase I. Lenalidomide will be administered by a stepwise dose-escalation&#xD;
      schedule in the phase I part. Thus, the primary endpoint in the phase I part is to determine&#xD;
      the MTD and safety of the regimen lenalidomide and gemcitabine as first-line treatment in&#xD;
      subjects with advanced pancreatic cancer.In the phase II part, primary endpoint is to&#xD;
      evaluate the immunomodulatory effects of lenalidomide in combination with gemcitabine in the&#xD;
      same patient population.&#xD;
