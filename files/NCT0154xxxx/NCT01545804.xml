      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II trial. Eligible patients must have histological or&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of Hepatocellular Carcinoma (HCC), advanced tumors that are not amenable&#xD;
      to loco-regional therapy, documented progression with or intolerance to sorafenib-based&#xD;
      treatment or other anti-angiogenic therapy as first-line therapy for advanced HCC.&#xD;

      This is a single-arm, open-label phase II trial. Eligible patients must have histological or&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of HCC, advanced tumors that are not amenable to loco-regional therapy,&#xD;
      documented progression with or intolerance to sorafenib-based treatment or other&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic therapy as first-line therapy for advanced HCC, ECOG performance status 0 or&#xD;
      1, Child-Pugh class A liver function, and measurable tumors (by RECIST 1.1). All enrolled&#xD;
      patients will receive lenalidomide, starting at 25 mg orally daily on days 1-21, every 4&#xD;
      weeks. Lenalidomide treatment will continue until objective disease progression, development&#xD;
      of unacceptable toxicity, or voluntary discontinuation. Dose titration will be done according&#xD;
      to the severity of adverse events. Tumor assessment will be done after 4 weeks and 8 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment and every 8 weeks thereafter until objective disease progression. All patients will&#xD;
      receive DCE-MRI at baseline, on day 3 ± 1 day, and on day 14 ± 2 days. The primary endpoint&#xD;
      is the percentage of patients who are tumor progression-free (according to RECIST 1.1) at 6&#xD;
      months after lenalidomide treatment. It is estimated that in the 2nd-line setting, 20% or&#xD;
      less patients will remain progression-free at 6 months with current treatment, i.e., no&#xD;
      standard treatment. Lenalidomide will be considered effective if the percentage of patients&#xD;
      who remain progression-free at 6 months can be increased to 40%. With type I and type II&#xD;
      errors of 0.05 and 0.1, respectively, 50 evaluable patients, i.e., patients who receive at&#xD;
      least 4 weeks of study medication and receive the first scheduled assessment of tumor&#xD;
      response, will be required and the planned sample size will be 55 patients, assuming a 10%&#xD;
      dropout rate. The study is expected to complete in 2 years.&#xD;
