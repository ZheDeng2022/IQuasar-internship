      INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of sucrose has been well studied for certain procedures in neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      unit patients and in the newborn nursery settings, particularly for venous blood draws,&#xD;
      capillary blood tests and circumcision. In these studies, infants receiving oral sucrose&#xD;
      solutions before procedures cried less and had overall decreased behavioural pain responses&#xD;
      when compared with those receiving placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Emergency Departments (ED), children undergo many painful procedures, such as bladder&#xD;
      catheterization, capillary blood tests, venipuncture and lumbar puncture. Only two studies&#xD;
      have examined the effectiveness of sweet solutions as an analgesic in the ED. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in an emergency setting of sucrose and/or pacifier for infants receiving&#xD;
      venipuncture conducted by Curtis and al among infants of 0 to 6 months demonstrated a trend&#xD;
      in reducing pain among the sub-group of infants of 0 to 3 months. However, this study showed&#xD;
      no difference in pain scales after 3 months of age. Also, in a study examining the effect of&#xD;
      sucrose during bladder catheterization, the subgroup of infants 1 to 30 days old who received&#xD;
      a sweet solution showed smaller changes in pain scores, were less likely to cry during&#xD;
      catheterization and returned to baseline more quickly, in comparison with the placebo group.&#xD;
      However, among children of 31 to 90 days, there was no statistically significant difference&#xD;
      in pain scores. In this study, they used a sucrose solution of only 24% and as they said in&#xD;
      the discussion, it is possible that older infants, who on average received a smaller dose (in&#xD;
      milligrams per kilogram), were in fact underdosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the painful procedure chosen for this study is bladder catheterization. Bladder&#xD;
      catheterizations are frequently performed in the ED in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS The investigators believe that providing an oral sucrose solution during bladder&#xD;
      catheterization will decrease pain levels in infants 1 to 3 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The investigators primary objective is to compare the efficacy an oral 88% sucrose&#xD;
      solution to a placebo solution in reducing pain as assessed by the FLACC scale in children of&#xD;
      1 to 3 months during bladder catheterization in the ED. The investigators secondary objective&#xD;
      is to asses changes in pain levels as per the NIPS score. The investigators will also measure&#xD;
      variations in heart rate and crying time. All side effects will also be reported.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pain is one of the most common adverse stimuli experienced by children, occurring as a&#xD;
      result of injury, illness, and necessary medical procedures. The American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Pain Society (APS) have jointly issued a statement&#xD;
      promoting the responsibility of paediatricians as leaders and advocates to ensure the humane&#xD;
      and competent treatment of pain and suffering in all infants, children, and adolescents.&#xD;
      Long-term effects of unmanaged pain in human infants have been shown to include permanent&#xD;
      impairment of elements of cognitive development, such as learning, memory, and behaviour,and&#xD;
      increased somatisation in childhood. The plasticity of the developing brain and the changes&#xD;
      that occur in response to painful stimuli also contribute to altered perceptions of pain&#xD;
      later in life. Early painful experiences affect children's future responses to analgesia.&#xD;
      Weisman et al found that inadequate analgesia in young children during procedures diminished&#xD;
      the effects of adequate analgesia during subsequent procedures. Many studies have suggested&#xD;
      that the prompt and accurate recognition and treatment of pain in young infants is important&#xD;
      for their immediate comfort and for their best possible lifelong development. Despite the&#xD;
      recent interest in paediatric pain assessment, prevention and treatment, many children do not&#xD;
      receive adequate management to alleviate pain. The ideal pre-procedural analgesic agent for&#xD;
      minor invasive procedures would be a cost-effective, inexpensive, short-acting agent with few&#xD;
      associated risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of sucrose has been well studied for certain procedures in neonatal intensive care&#xD;
      unit patients and in the newborn nursery settings, particularly for venous blood draws,&#xD;
      capillary blood tests and circumcision. In these studies, infants receiving oral sucrose&#xD;
      solutions before procedures cried less and had overall decreased behavioural pain responses&#xD;
      when compared with those receiving placebo. Furthermore, sucrose has been shown to be a safe&#xD;
      intervention with no serious life-threatening adverse events and only few reported side&#xD;
      effects consisting of minimal coughing with administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A Cochrane systematic review concluded that sucrose is safe and effective in reducing&#xD;
      procedural pain from single short procedural events in neonates, but an optimal dose could&#xD;
      not be identified due to inconsistency in effective sucrose dosage among studies. A review of&#xD;
      published studies reported that sucrose or glucose in healthy term or preterm infants during&#xD;
      single episodes of heel lancing, venipuncture or intramuscular injection is effective.&#xD;
      However, uncertainties remain beyond the neonatal period, given the limited number of&#xD;
      published studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Emergency Departments (ED), children undergo many painful procedures, such as bladder&#xD;
      catheterization, capillary blood tests, venipuncture and lumbar puncture. Only two studies&#xD;
      have examined the effectiveness of sweet solutions as an analgesic in the ED. A randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial in an emergency setting of sucrose and/or pacifier for infants receiving&#xD;
      venipuncture conducted by Curtis and al among infants of 0 to 6 months demonstrated a trend&#xD;
      in reducing pain among the sub-group of infants of 0 to 3 months. However, this study showed&#xD;
      no difference in pain scales after 3 months of age. Also, in a study examining the effect of&#xD;
      sucrose during bladder catheterization, the subgroup of infants 1 to 30 days old who received&#xD;
      a sweet solution showed smaller changes in pain scores, were less likely to cry during&#xD;
      catheterization and returned to baseline more quickly, in comparison with the placebo group.&#xD;
      However, among children of 31 to 90 days, there was no statistically significant difference&#xD;
      in pain scores. In this study, they used a sucrose solution of only 24% and as they said in&#xD;
      the discussion, it is possible that older infants, who on average received a smaller dose (in&#xD;
      milligrams per kilogram), were in fact underdosed. Moreover, they use the Douleur Aiguë du&#xD;
      Nouveau-né (DAN) pain scale, which is less recognized than the FLACC scale to evaluate pain&#xD;
      in such a study population. Finally, there were not enough participants between 30 and 90&#xD;
      days of age to obtain statistical significance for this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, studies have used varieties of concentrations of sucrose (e.g. Rogers had used sucrose&#xD;
      24%, Curtis had used sucrose 44% and Lewindon had used sucrose 75%). Systematic reviews of&#xD;
      the current literature have been unable to demonstrate superiority of one concentration of a&#xD;
      sweet solution over another, but many studies suggest that higher concentrations of sweet&#xD;
      solutions seem more effective. Therefore, the investigators chose to study the effect of a&#xD;
      sweet solution named syrup B.P. (product by Laboratoire Atlas inc.) which contains 88% of&#xD;
      sucrose. This solution is already commonly used in the population of infants up to 3 months&#xD;
      of age and it is safe (e.g. prednisone syrup is made using this syrup). A 2 ml dose of 88%&#xD;
      sucrose contains the same amount of carbohydrates as 25 ml of infant milk formulas which&#xD;
      contain approximately 7,5g/100 ml. Also, 88% sucrose has the same concentration of sugar as&#xD;
      many other medications which are commonly used in infants, such as oral antibiotics, oral&#xD;
      steroid solutions and other pain medications. This syrup is of particular interest as it is&#xD;
      of low cost ($9,58 for a bottle of 2000 ml), universally available, stable and viable for&#xD;
      approximately three months. Therefore, the intervention studied here would be easy to apply&#xD;
      in most clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the painful procedure chosen for this study is bladder catheterization. Bladder&#xD;
      catheterizations are frequently performed in the ED in this age group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no pain scales which have been validated precisely for the age group&#xD;
      studied in this project. However, the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC)&#xD;
      scale is recommended by the IMMPACT group (Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain&#xD;
      Assessment in Clinical Trials). FLACC is an easily applicable pain scale in which the&#xD;
      observer scores a patient on 5 categories, from 0 to 2 points, for a total score of maximum&#xD;
      10 points. The validity and reliability of this pain scale has been established in the past&#xD;
      for children from 2 months to 7 years. Validity was evaluated by comparing the FLACC scale&#xD;
      with the Objective Pain Scale and demonstrated that both tools showed similar behaviours&#xD;
      (r=0.80; p&lt;0.001). The interrater reliability between 2 observers was considered good&#xD;
      (r[87]=0.94; p&lt;0.001) with a kappa value greater than 0,50 for each category. Therefore, this&#xD;
      pain scale was chosen as the measure of the investigators primary outcome, in this population&#xD;
      of infants from 1 to 3 months old. Furthermore, the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale (NIPS) is a&#xD;
      well validated pain scale for newborns up to 1 month of age. This pain scale was chosen as a&#xD;
      secondary outcome. The investigators estimate that using one pain scale validated in infants&#xD;
      up to 1 month of age and another validated in infants older than 2 months of age will allow&#xD;
      us to assess pain in infants from 1 to 3 months of age best, given current available tools.&#xD;
      Furthermore, other patient parameters such as heart rate and crying time will be used to&#xD;
      corroborate findings.&#xD;

      catheterization will decrease pain levels in infants 1 to 3 months of age.&#xD;
