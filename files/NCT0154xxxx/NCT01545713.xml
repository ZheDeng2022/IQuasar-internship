    <textblock>
      Antibody Mediated Rejection (AMR) is a major complication of solid organ transplantation. The&#xD;
      main reason for AMR is pre-formed, or de-novo, donor specific antibodies against the donor&#xD;
      human leukocyte antigens (HLA). Additional potential targets are antibodies against MIC-A&#xD;
      antigens or antibodies against targets expressed on the donor endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Until recently, no specific means were available to test for the presence of donor-specific&#xD;
      endothelial cell antibodies. The newly introduced XM-One AbSorber® assay allows isolating&#xD;
      precursor endothelial cells from donor peripheral blood, and thus assessing the presence of&#xD;
      donor-specific endothelial cell antibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      XM-One AbSorber® is an in-vitro assay that allows for the specific enrichment of precursor&#xD;
      endothelial cells which in turn promotes endothelial cells specific cross match testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This assay is currently being used in an on-going Northwestern University (NU) research study&#xD;
      (STU#00029988). The preliminary results of this study indicate that indeed some of the&#xD;
      patients test positive against their respective donors. One potential explanation for this&#xD;
      observation, that was not previously entertained, is that the antibodies causing the positive&#xD;
      cross match response are actually of autoimmune nature. In order to rule-out such a potential&#xD;
      explanation the investigators would like to further test these patients by performing an&#xD;
      autologous XM-One AbSorber® assay in which the recipient sera will be incubated with the&#xD;
      patients' own cells (as opposed to the respective donor cells in the parental study). This&#xD;
      information is crucial for proper analysis of the data obtained in the NU STU#00029988 study.&#xD;

      This assay is currently being used in an on-going Northwestern University (NU) research study&#xD;

      observation, that was not previously entertained, is that the antibodies causing the positive&#xD;
      cross match response are actually of autoimmune nature. In order to rule-out such a potential&#xD;
      explanation we would like to further test these patients by performing an autologous XM-One&#xD;
      AbSorber® assay in which the recipient sera will be incubated with the patients' own cells&#xD;
      (as opposed to the respective donor cells in the parental study). This information is crucial&#xD;
      for proper analysis of the data obtained in the NU STU#00029988 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial data from our laboratory indicates that the antigens identified by the XM-One&#xD;
      Absorber® assay differ from the HLA antigens usually identified by routine cross match&#xD;
      assays. Moreover, we were able to document that this is a polymorphic system and therefore&#xD;
      identifying a donor-specific source is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the 150 patients already studied under NU research protocol STU#00029988 we found that 19&#xD;
      patients exhibited a positive response in a donor-specific XM-One AbSorber® assay. In this&#xD;
      current research protocol study we want to follow-up on the specimens that exhibited a&#xD;
      positive response in a donor-specific XM-One AbSorber® assay and perform an autologous XM-One&#xD;
      AbSorber® assay to validate the clinical significance of our results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been one multicenter study reported indicating the &quot;XM-One AbSorber® is a quick,&#xD;
      easy to perform on whole blood samples and identifies patients at risk for rejection and&#xD;
      reduced graft function not identified by conventional lymphocyte cross matches&quot; The primary&#xD;
      objective is to complete additional testing for accuracy to determine whether antibodies&#xD;
      directed at donor-specific endothelial cell effect transplant outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the frequency of autologous antibodies that may be&#xD;
      falsely reported as donor-specific anti-endothelial antibodies in our patient population. The&#xD;
      single center research study we here at Northwestern University have been working on since&#xD;
      May 19, 2010 thus far has resulted in 19 out of 150 specimens tested, have positive results&#xD;
      based on the XM-One AbSorber® assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective study we plan to include all XM-One AbSorber® positive test results from&#xD;
      all recipients of living-donor kidney transplants performed at Northwestern Memorial Hospital&#xD;
      (NMH) since May 19, 2010 initial Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval until 250&#xD;
      transplants are performed. For this research protocol we will be targeting patients to&#xD;
      consent only these individuals who have received a XM-One AbSorber® positive test result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each donor / recipient pair are required to send peripheral blood samples to the HLA&#xD;
      laboratory prior to the scheduled transplant in order to perform lymphocyte cross match (to&#xD;
      detect donor specific HLA antibodies; this is (SOC) standard of care). Left over serum and&#xD;
      cells from these tests are being used to isolate an enriched precursor endothelial cell&#xD;
      population and perform the XM-One AbSorber® assay (NU research protocol #STU00029988).&#xD;
&#xD;
      XM-One AbSorber® assay results - both autologous and allogeneic - will be captured and&#xD;
      compared with graft outcome measurements at 3, 6, and 12 months post-transplant. Transplant&#xD;
      outcome will be recorded as creatinine levels at the specific time points, protocol and&#xD;
      for-cause biopsy results within the first year post transplant, diagnosis of acute cellular&#xD;
      or humoral rejection, variation in immunosuppression levels, and any other complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients that exhibit a positive XM-One AbSorber® allogeneic cross match result will be&#xD;
      requested to donate 4 green top tubes of peripheral blood. Cells obtained from this blood&#xD;
      will be used in an autologous XM-One AbSorber® cross match assay using the original serum&#xD;
      sample used for the allogeneic XM-One AbSorber® cross match assay.&#xD;
