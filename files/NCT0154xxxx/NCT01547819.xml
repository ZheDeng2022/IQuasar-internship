      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people who have a traumatic brain injury (TBI) recover completely. Others, however,&#xD;
      develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with anxiety and depression. Research suggests&#xD;
      that levels of a brain chemical called GABA may differ in people with PTSD compared to those&#xD;
      without PTSD. Researchers want to see if TBI can affect GABA in the brain and help develop&#xD;
      PTSD. To look at the brain, researchers will use imaging studies with the chemical&#xD;
      11C-Flumazenil, which will help the scan show GABA levels in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study the relationship between PTSD and TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be recruited from the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center&#xD;
      (WRNMMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have PTSD and/or had a mild TBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy individuals between 18 and 50 years of age who have no history TBI and no&#xD;
           history of PTSD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Urine and breath&#xD;
           samples will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have two imaging studies, on the same day if possible. The first will&#xD;
           be a magnetic resonance imaging scan to look at the brain. The second will be a positron&#xD;
           emission tomography scan with the study chemical to look at GABA pathways in the&#xD;
           brain....&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to investigate the potential role of mild traumatic&#xD;
      brain injury (mTBI) in the development of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We will&#xD;
      characterize the central GABAergic system function in patients with PTSD after TBI&#xD;
      (TBI-PTSD), subjects with TBI only (TBI-no PTSD), subjects with PTSD only (PTSD-no TBI ), and&#xD;
      healthy non-TBI non-PTSD subjects (HC), using PET imaging with (11)C-Flumazenil (FMZ). Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that neuronal and axonal damage due to TBI results in GABAergic system&#xD;
      dysfunction which could potentially lead to or contribute to the development of PTSD. We will&#xD;
      also correlate the degree of (11)C-FMZ binding abnormalities with time elapsed since the&#xD;
      original physical or psychological trauma in TBI-PTSD and PTSD-no TBI patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fifty-six male and female adult subjects will be recruited: 14 subjects with PTSD following&#xD;
      an episode of non-penetrating mTBI (TBI-PTSD), 14 subjects with mTBI but no history of PTSD&#xD;
      (TBI-no PTSD), 14 subjects with PTSD but no history of TBI (PTSD-no TBI), and 14 healthy&#xD;
      volunteers (HC) with no PTSD and no history of TBI. The subjects will be recruited from the&#xD;
      Walter Reed National Military Medical Center (WRNMMC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective case-control study of the four subject groups mentioned above. Subjects&#xD;
      will be stratified according to detailed psychiatric evaluation performed at WRNMMC. Subjects&#xD;
      will not be treated with experimental therapies as part of the research study. This study&#xD;
      will provide no direct benefit to subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure will be (11)C-FMZ binding potential (BP) differences among these&#xD;
      four subject groups. Other outcome measures will include Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)&#xD;
      anatomical findings and the correlation of (11)C-FMZ binding abnormalities with time elapsed&#xD;
      since the original physical trauma in TBI-PTSD group or original psychological trauma in PTSD&#xD;
      only group.&#xD;
