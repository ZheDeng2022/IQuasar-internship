      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic disease management (CDM) presents enormous challenges to the primary care workforce&#xD;
      due to the rising epidemic of cardiovascular risk factors. The Chronic Care Model (CCM) was&#xD;
      proven effective in improving chronic disease outcomes in developed countries. Evidence that&#xD;
      this model works in developing countries is still scarce. Therefore, the aim of this study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the effectiveness of the EMPOWER-PAR intervention (multifaceted CDM strategies&#xD;
      based on the CCM) in managing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension (HPT), using&#xD;
      readily available resources in the Malaysian public primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a pragmatic cluster randomised controlled trial - participatory action research which&#xD;
      is currently being conducted in 10 public primary care clinics in Selangor and Kuala Lumpur,&#xD;
      Malaysia. Five clinics are randomly selected to provide the EMPOWER-PAR intervention for 1&#xD;
      year, while the other 5 clinics continued with usual care. Each clinic recruits consecutive&#xD;
      T2DM and HPT patients who fulfil the inclusion and exclusion criteria over a 2-week period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMPOWER-PAR intervention consists of creating/strengthening a multidisciplinary CDM Team;&#xD;
      and training the team to utilise the Global CV Risks Self-Management Booklet to support&#xD;
      patient care and reinforcing them to utilise relevant clinical practice guidelines to aid&#xD;
      management and prescribing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For T2DM, primary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients achieving target HbA1c&#xD;
      of &lt;6.5%. For HPT without T2DM, primary outcome is the change in the proportion of patients&#xD;
      achieving target blood pressure of &lt;140/90 mmHg. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of&#xD;
      patients achieving targets serum lipid profile, body mass index and waist circumference.&#xD;
      Other outcome measures include medication adherence levels, process of care and prescribing&#xD;
      patterns. Patients' assessment of their chronic disease care, providers' perception, attitude&#xD;
      and perceived barriers in delivering the care and cost-effectiveness of the intervention are&#xD;
      also evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONCLUSION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will provide objective evidence of the effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention based on the CCM in resource constraint&#xD;
      public primary care setting. It is hoped that the evidence will instigate the much needed&#xD;
      primary care system change in Malaysia.&#xD;

      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary hypothesis for T2DM patients is that the proportion achieving target HbA1c of&#xD;
      &lt;6.5% would improve with the EMPOWER-PAR intervention. The primary hypothesis for HPT&#xD;
      patients without T2DM is that the proportion achieving target BP of &lt;140/90 mmHg would&#xD;
      improve with the EMPOWER-PAR intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary hypothesis for T2DM patients is that the proportion achieving target blood&#xD;
      pressure (BP) of &lt;130/80 mmHg would improve with the EMPOWER-PAR intervention. The secondary&#xD;
      hypotheses for both groups of patients (T2DM and HPT without T2DM) are that the proportions&#xD;
      achieving target fasting serum lipid, body mass index (BMI) and waist circumference (WC)&#xD;
      would improve with the intervention. Medication adherence levels and patients' perceptions of&#xD;
      their experience in receiving chronic disease care are also expected to improve with the&#xD;
      intervention. Secondary hypotheses are also made at the primary care providers' level in&#xD;
      terms of the process of care and prescribing pattern which are expected to improve with the&#xD;
      intervention. Cost-effectiveness analysis and primary care providers' perception, attitude,&#xD;
      experience and perceived barriers in implementing the intervention are also explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pragmatic cluster-randomised parallel controlled trial -participatory action research&#xD;
           conducted in 10 public primary care clinics from two states in Malaysia which are&#xD;
           Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur (WPKL) and Selangor (SEL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The overall duration of the study is 2 years while the duration of intervention is 1&#xD;
           year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinding is not possible due to the nature and complexity of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 34 clinics led by Family Medicine Specialists (FMS) in SEL and WPKL are invited to&#xD;
      participate in the study and are given the site feasibility assessment form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To be eligible, the clinics must satisfy all of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. have a minimum of 500 T2DM patients and 500 HPT patients in the registry. ii. have an FMS&#xD;
      who is keen to participate in the study and is willing to lead the implementation of the&#xD;
      intervention components in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Have the minimum capacity to implement the obligatory components of the EMPOWER-PAR&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. located within 70 km from the central laboratory as the blood samples are transported&#xD;
      back to the centre for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site feasibility assessment is conducted to identify eligible clinics. Out of the 34 sites,&#xD;
      only 20 fulfil the eligibility criteria to enter the study. These 20 clinics are then matched&#xD;
      into 10 pairs according to their geographical locations, staffing and workload. Geographical&#xD;
      location is divided into urban and sub-urban areas. Urban area is defined as an area located&#xD;
      within a major city, while sub-urban area is defined as an area located surrounding and&#xD;
      within commuting distance to a major city. Staffing is defined as the number of doctors and&#xD;
      allied health personnel (FMS, medical officers, assistant medical officers, staff nurses,&#xD;
      dieticians/nutritionists and pharmacists) working in the clinic. Workload is defined as the&#xD;
      average number of patients being seen in the clinic per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multistage randomisation is performed using computer generated tables. The first stage is to&#xD;
      randomly select 5 out of the 10 pairs to be included into the study. The second stage is to&#xD;
      randomly allocate the clinics into intervention and control arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Recruitment&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study recruits consecutive T2DM and/or HPT patients who attend the selected clinic&#xD;
      within the 2-week recruitment period. They are given the patient information sheet in the&#xD;
      waiting area. Informed consents are obtained from those who are willing to participate.&#xD;
      Screening is conducted to identify eligible participants based on the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Eligible patients are then enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Males and females aged ≥ 18 years who are diagnosed with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. T2DM or HPT or both&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Seen at least once in the last one year at the primary care clinic for the above&#xD;
           conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Receiving renal dialysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Presenting with severe HPT (Systolic BP &gt;180mmHg and/or Diastolic BP &gt;110 mmHg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Diagnosed with conditions resulting in secondary hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Diagnosed to have circulatory disorders needing referral to secondary care over the last&#xD;
           1 year e.g. unstable angina, heart attack, stroke, transient ischaemic attacks&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Receiving shared care between primary and secondary care for complications of T2DM&#xD;
           and/or HPT&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Enrolled in another study&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the intervention arm are required to be seen at least twice by the CDM team&#xD;
      of each clinic during the 1-year intervention period. Those who do not comply are considered&#xD;
      as lost to follow-up. There is no limit to the number of clinic visits a patient is allowed&#xD;
      to make in either arm during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMPOWER-PAR INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention, referred to as the EMPOWER-PAR Intervention, is developed in&#xD;
      accordance with the Medical Research Council (MRC) guidance on developing and evaluating&#xD;
      complex interventions to improve health outcomes and is implemented at the primary care&#xD;
      clinics for a period of 1-year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying framework in developing the complex intervention for EMPOWER-PAR is based on 6&#xD;
      interrelated elements of the CCM. The 6 elements are 1) organisation of health care (i.e.&#xD;
      providing leadership and minimising barriers to care), 2) self-management support (i.e.&#xD;
      facilitating skills-based learning and patient empowerment), 3) decision support (i.e.&#xD;
      providing guidance for implementing evidence-based care), 4) delivery system design (i.e.&#xD;
      coordinating care processes), 5) clinical information systems (i.e. tracking progress through&#xD;
      reporting outcomes to patients and providers), and 6) community resources and policies (i.e.&#xD;
      sustaining care by using community-based resources).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three obligatory components which define the EMPOWER-PAR intervention are developed based on&#xD;
      4 interrelated elements of CCM (organisation of health care, delivery system design,&#xD;
      self-management support and decision support). These intervention components utilise readily&#xD;
      available and existing resources in the Malaysian public primary care setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Creating/Strengthening a CDM Team-a multidisciplinary team lead by FMS to improve&#xD;
      coordination of care for T2DM and/or HPT and co-existing CV risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Utilising the Global CV Risks Self-Management Booklet to support patients self-management&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Utilising the Clinical Practice Guidelines (CPG) for T2DM and HPT to aid management and&#xD;
      prescribing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two optional components of the EMPOWER-PAR intervention are developed based on the other 2&#xD;
      CCM elements (clinical information system and community resources):&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Utilising clinical information system and conducting clinical audits to track progress&#xD;
      through reporting outcomes to patients and providers&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Utilising community resources to support and sustain care&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size calculation was conducted based on the randomised clustered trial design&#xD;
      using PASS software (Copyright (c) 2009 by Dr Jerry L. Hintze, All Rights Reserved).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation for T2DM patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 626 (313 in each arm) is obtained by sampling 10 clusters (5 intervention vs&#xD;
      5 control) with 63 subjects from each cluster to achieve 91% power to detect 25% difference&#xD;
      in the proportion of subjects achieving target HbA1c &lt;6.5% from baseline and between the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test (unpooled).&#xD;
      The significance level of the test is 0.05. Therefore, after allowing for 25% dropout rate,&#xD;
      this study aims to recruit a total sample of 836 T2DM patients at baseline i.e. 418 in each&#xD;
      arm and 84 from each clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation for HPT patients without T2DM&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 438 (219 in each arm) is obtained by sampling 10 clusters (5 intervention vs&#xD;
      5 control) with 44 subjects from each cluster to achieve 88% power to detect 25% difference&#xD;
      in the proportion of subjects achieving target BP &lt;140/90 mmHg from baseline and between the&#xD;
      intervention and control groups. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test (unpooled).&#xD;
      The significance level of the test is 0.05. Therefore, after allowing for 25% dropout rate,&#xD;
      this study aims to recruit a total sample of 584 HPT patients at baseline i.e. 292 in each&#xD;
      arm and 58 from each clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical analysis plan to test the primary hypotheses of the study is described.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be described by summary statistics (means and standard deviations)&#xD;
      for normally distributed variables. If the distribution is not normal, median with&#xD;
      inter-quartile range will be reported instead. Other descriptive statistics, such as minimum&#xD;
      and maximum values will be reported when necessary. Categorical (nominal/ordinal) variables&#xD;
      will be described by frequencies with percentages. All outcomes are treated as categorical&#xD;
      variables (e.g. proportions of patients achieving targets for HbA1c and BP). To assess the&#xD;
      differences in the proportions of patients who are able to reach the treatment goals by their&#xD;
      intervention strategy, a generalized estimation equation model that adjusts for clustering&#xD;
      effects will be used. The model will be an independent working model. Treatment effects will&#xD;
      be obtained using the estimated marginal means and differences will be tested using the Wald&#xD;
      chi-square tests. The power of the study will be recalculated based on the effect size and&#xD;
      after taking into account the clustering effect of the study design. An intention-to-treat&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted, and P-values of less than 0.05 will be considered significant.&#xD;
      All analyses will be carried out using SPSS (IBM Corp. Released 2011 IBM SPSS Statistics for&#xD;
      Windows, Version 20.0. Armonk, NY: IBM Corp.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Ethics Committee of UiTM and Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC) of the Ministry of&#xD;
      Health (MOH) approves the study protocol. Permission from the Family Health Development&#xD;
      Division (FHDD) of the MOH and the respective Health District Offices are also obtained prior&#xD;
      to the conduct of the study. The study is conducted in accordance to the Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki and Good Clinical Practice (GCP) requirements. Patient information sheet are given&#xD;
      and informed consent are obtained from all participants prior to their study enrolment. For&#xD;
      participants who are unable to read, the content of the consent form is read aloud to them&#xD;
      and a copy of the patient information sheet is given to their next of kin with additional&#xD;
      explanation given if needed. Confidentiality of personal information is ensured at all times.&#xD;
      Subject enrolment is done by the investigators and not their attending doctors to reduce&#xD;
      subject's vulnerability to participate in the study. Subjects are informed of any immediate&#xD;
      results obtained from the study that may affect their care or health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DISCUSSION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EMPOWER-PAR is the first pragmatic, randomised controlled trial of multifaceted chronic&#xD;
      disease management strategies being conducted in the Malaysian public primary care setting.&#xD;
      It is expected to yield important new evidence on the improvements of T2DM and HPT clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, the two most prevalent chronic diseases being managed in the public primary care&#xD;
      sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultimately, results from this study will provide objective evidence of the effectiveness and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of a multifaceted intervention based on the CCM in a resource-constrained&#xD;
      public primary care setting. If proven effective, the results may be generalisable to other&#xD;
      Malaysian public primary clinics which share the same characteristics and would probably be&#xD;
      inexpensive to replicate. It is hoped that the objective evidence from EMPOWER-PAR would&#xD;
      provide a platform to instigate the much needed primary health care system change in&#xD;
      Malaysia.&#xD;
