  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The &quot;IMPACT Plus&quot; Integrated Complex Care Clinic will create a team model of simultaneous&#xD;
      interprofessional consultation and planning that brings together patients with complex or&#xD;
      multiple chronic diseases, significant others/caregivers, the primary care team, community&#xD;
      care providers and, uniquely, secondary consultation in real time at the primary care site.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether the IMPACT clinic will reduce admission to&#xD;
      hospital and visits to the emergency department (ED) in comparison to a control (usual care)&#xD;
      group during a one year period of observation. Chart audits will be conducted on a monthly&#xD;
      basis to calculate patients' complexity scores and data on all health services provided&#xD;
      during the intervention phase, and compared between the intervention and control group.&#xD;
      Additionally, surveys and semi-structured interviews aimed to measure patient, caregiver, and&#xD;
      healthcare professional satisfaction of the IMPACT+ prior to and after initial assessment&#xD;
      will be collected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a pragmatic clinical trial to evaluate whether the IMPACT model&#xD;
      will reduce hospital admissions and emergency room visits. All patients who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will be randomized to be invited for assessment in IMPACT or be followed&#xD;
      in usual care. Each FHT will generate a list of eligible participants drawn from their EMR.&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly selected from this list and patients will be invited for an&#xD;
      IMPACT assessment. Using data collected at each FHT by a trained chart abstractor on a&#xD;
      monthly basis, all hospital admissions and emergency room visits will be counted. As well,&#xD;
      all health service utilization for both intervention and control group will be collected. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare the proportion of patients admitted to hospital or seen in the&#xD;
      emergency room between the intervention and control group for the one year time period. For&#xD;
      the secondary objectives of the study, patient and care givers in the intervention group will&#xD;
      be asked to complete the Caregiver Strain Index (a standardized and validated instrument)&#xD;
      both before the IMPACT intervention and up to 6 months later. The investigators will adapt an&#xD;
      existing survey to measure health care professionals' experiences in providing care in an&#xD;
      inter-professional team for seniors with complex chronic illness. The Dimensions of Teamwork&#xD;
      Survey, will be administered at each FHT at the beginning of the study and at the end of the&#xD;
      intervention period in order to assess team function and stability of team function. Lastly,&#xD;
      interviews with patients, caregivers, and healthcare professionals will be conducted to&#xD;
      explore satisfaction with the IMPACT experience and subsequent care as well as self-efficacy&#xD;
      in managing their care. The interviews will be audio-recorded and professionally transcribed.&#xD;
      Key themes emerging from the qualitative data will be identified. Preliminary findings will&#xD;
      be subjected to a process of member checking/respondent validation to ensure accuracy of&#xD;
      interpretation.&#xD;
