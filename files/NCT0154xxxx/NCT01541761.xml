  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study is a randomized controlled trial to test the effectiveness of a primary&#xD;
      care, family-centered child obesity prevention program beginning in pregnancy and continuing&#xD;
      throughout the first three years of life compared to routine standard of care. The study aims&#xD;
      to reduce the prevalence of obesity at age three, improve child diet composition and healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle behaviors. Pregnant women will be enrolled from a large urban medical center&#xD;
      serving primarily low-income immigrant Latino families. The intervention &quot;Starting Early&quot;&#xD;
      will consist of three components. 1) Family Groups: interactive groups coordinated with the&#xD;
      child's primary care visits and led by a Nutritionist/ Child Developmental Specialist. 2)&#xD;
      Nutritional Video: a culturally-specific bilingual early nutrition video will be incorporated&#xD;
      into family group discussions. 3) Plain Language Handouts: given to reinforce the curriculum&#xD;
      from the family groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research included in the funding continuation is titled: &quot;Starting Early:&#xD;
      Expansion of a Primary Care-Based Early Child Obesity Prevention Program&quot;. It adds three&#xD;
      major components to the current project: 1) Following the original Starting Early cohort&#xD;
      until age 5; 2) Developing and piloting an extended Starting Early preschool intervention for&#xD;
      children aged 3-5 years.; 3) Developing and piloting an extended Starting Early prenatal&#xD;
      intervention for women in the 1st trimester of pregnancy. A new cohort of 200 women in the&#xD;
      first trimester of pregnancy will be recruited for the prenatal intervention; all women will&#xD;
      receive the intervention in this feasibility trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Compared to controls, the intervention group will show reduced obesity and&#xD;
      improved parent feeding knowledge and increased healthy feeding attitudes, styles and&#xD;
      practices&#xD;

      Expected outcomes include: (1) Reduction in the prevalence and degree of obesity. (2)&#xD;
      Improvement in child diet composition. (3) Improvement in parent feeding knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, styles and practices including. (4) Improvement in lifestyle behaviors, such as&#xD;
      sleep, screen time and physical activity, associated with increased risk of obesity. (5)&#xD;
      Improvement in parent diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objective is to understand the mechanisms by which changes in parent knowledge&#xD;
      and behavioral factors mediate impacts of the intervention on childhood obesity. We will also&#xD;
      study relationships between potential moderators and intervention impacts. The new components&#xD;
      of the expanded Starting Early Program will be feasible: Families will participate in the&#xD;
      preschool intervention, and pregnant women will enroll in the prenatal intervention.&#xD;
