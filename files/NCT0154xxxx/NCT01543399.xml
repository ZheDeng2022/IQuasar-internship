  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The interruption of the secretion of sex steroids occurring during menopause, causes a change&#xD;
      in vascular pattern at various levels. As a result, several agencies have side effects that&#xD;
      interfere with women's health. The use of hormone replacement therapy has contributed to the&#xD;
      improvement in these effects. In previous studies the investigators showed the effect of sex&#xD;
      steroids in premenopausal women in the conjugated equine estrogens, medroxyprogesterone&#xD;
      acetate and tibolone in menopausal women, on the central retinal arteries. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the effects of Tibolone in Flow-Mediated Dilatation of the brachial&#xD;
      artery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Menopause is a transitional phase of the biological evolution of women where there is loss of&#xD;
      reproductive capacity. The phenomena are the most striking manifestations represented by&#xD;
      vasomotor hot flushes and sweating, the consequent fall in estradiol production by the&#xD;
      ovaries. The main landmark of the menopause is menopause, which is the last period governed&#xD;
      by the ovaries, reflecting the depletion of the same follicle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main clinical manifestations of the climacteric are vascular, acting through mechanisms&#xD;
      of action not fully understood. Several studies were published showing its effect on&#xD;
      vasomotor tone and demonstrating the production of vasoactive substances by vascular cells&#xD;
      induced by them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of HRT (Hormone Replacement Therapy), is to improve the physical and&#xD;
      psychological state of women who have climacteric disorders, leading to improved quality of&#xD;
      life. The American College of Physicians, after careful review of available evidence, it is&#xD;
      recommended that all postmenopausal women should be considered eligible to receive HRT and&#xD;
      that the decision to treat or not should be individualized. Besides the knowledge of the&#xD;
      pattern of endocrine patients climate, the investigators must subject it to full physical&#xD;
      examination (pelvic) and exams before planning to start HRT. Complementary tests must be&#xD;
      clinically oriented, respecting the resources available. There is no need to make routine use&#xD;
      of doses of gonadotropins and sex steroids, which are reserved for certain diagnostic&#xD;
      situations where there is any doubt, for example, premature ovarian failure syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      He is currently a world consensus that the best available treatment for menopause is hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy because exogenously resets once the hormones produced by the ovaries. HRT&#xD;
      fulfills several objectives: reverse neurovegetative symptoms, improves trophism genital&#xD;
      atrophy and genital-urinary, acts in the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, leading to&#xD;
      lower incidence of colorectal cancer, promotes a later onset, lower incidence, evolution and&#xD;
      improvement in symptoms of Alzheimer's disease has a positive influence on the view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of HRT and the results that prove their individual benefits and&#xD;
      epidemiological brought new questions about the most appropriate way to use the various&#xD;
      schemes available. The treatment regimens are designed to establish a hormonal profile&#xD;
      similar to that of premenopausal using: estrogens, progestogens and androgens in different&#xD;
      doses and routes of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estrogens are the most commonly used conjugated estrogens. The subcutaneous implants (17 beta&#xD;
      estradiol) The percutaneous estradiol in the form of gels, transdermal devices (patches) and&#xD;
      Tibolone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hormones can be used alone or combined, cyclic or continuous, always trying to individualize&#xD;
      each situation in order to provide patients with a regimen that suits your needs and desires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since its description in 1989, the extent of dilatation of the brachial artery flow-mediated&#xD;
      (FMD) has been used to assess endothelial function. It is believed that ischemia induced by&#xD;
      inflation of the cuff cause a dilation of the vessel, leading to an increase in brachial&#xD;
      artery flow. This effect seems to be mediated by NO production by normal endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients whose bioactivity of NO is decreased or absent on endothelial function&#xD;
      impairment, this dilatory response does not happen. The dilation of the brachial artery is&#xD;
      thus higher in patients with normal endothelial function than in patients who have a&#xD;
      pathology that leads to endothelial injury, among them, Hypertension, Coronary heart disease,&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus, smoking, hyperlipidemia and Pre-Eclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly divided into two groups of 30, using code envelope with the&#xD;
      medication, without her or responsible for the study to know the component to be used&#xD;
      (double-blind study), with groups divided as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 placebo for 30 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2: Tibolone 2.5 mg / day for 30 days Patients will be evaluated before the use of&#xD;
           drugs and the end of their use (28-30 days of medication use).&#xD;
