    <measure>Number of Participants in the ITT Population With a Reduction in the Day 1 (Baseline) Total Clinical Signs and Symptom Score by at Least 2 Units at Day 15 With No Worsening of Any Sign or Symptom</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 15</time_frame>
    <description>The clinical signs of blepharitis (eyelid swelling, eyelid redness, eyelid debris) were evaluated at every visit and scored by the investigator using a 0 to 3 grading scale (in general 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The symptom of eyelid irritation was also evaluated at every visit and graded by the participant using a 0 to 3 grading scale (0 = almost none of the time - ≤ 25% of the time, 1 = occasionally - 26-50% of the time, 2 = frequently - 51-75% of the time, 3 = almost all of the time - ≥ 76% of the time). For each visit, the total clinical signs and symptom score was obtained by adding each of the individual scores for each domain (eyelid swelling, eyelid redness, eyelid debris, and eyelid irritation). Participants with a decrease in total clinical signs and symptom score at Day 15 by at least 2 units from Day 1 (baseline) with no increase in any sign and symptom were defined as Responders, and those not meeting these criteria were defined as Non-responders.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Complete Resolution of Eyelid Irritation (Last Observation Carried Forward [LOCF]) on Day 15 in ITT Population</measure>

    <description>Complete resolution of eyelid irritation, which was defined as eyelid irritation with grading of 0, at Day 15 was analyzed. The symptoms of eyelid irritation were graded by the participant using a 0 to 3 grading scale, where 0 = almost none of the time - ≤ 25% of the time, 1 = occasionally - 26-50% of the time, 2 = frequently - 51-75% of the time, 3 = almost all of the time - ≥ 76% of the time.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants in the ITT Population With a Reduction in the Day 1 (Baseline) Total Clinical Signs and Symptom Score by at Least 2 Units at Day 15 With No Worsening of Any Sign or Symptom</title>
        <description>The clinical signs of blepharitis (eyelid swelling, eyelid redness, eyelid debris) were evaluated at every visit and scored by the investigator using a 0 to 3 grading scale (in general 0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, and 3 = severe). The symptom of eyelid irritation was also evaluated at every visit and graded by the participant using a 0 to 3 grading scale (0 = almost none of the time - ≤ 25% of the time, 1 = occasionally - 26-50% of the time, 2 = frequently - 51-75% of the time, 3 = almost all of the time - ≥ 76% of the time). For each visit, the total clinical signs and symptom score was obtained by adding each of the individual scores for each domain (eyelid swelling, eyelid redness, eyelid debris, and eyelid irritation). Participants with a decrease in total clinical signs and symptom score at Day 15 by at least 2 units from Day 1 (baseline) with no increase in any sign and symptom were defined as Responders, and those not meeting these criteria were defined as Non-responders.</description>
