      This is a study intended to evaluate a new device that uses light to measure the amount of&#xD;
      oxygen in the muscles of injured and non-injured legs and forearms in specific situations.&#xD;
      The name of this technology is NIRS (near-infrared spectroscopy). This is a prospective&#xD;
      observational cohort study intended to gather data using NIRS among injured and noninjured&#xD;
      extremities over time. Additionally, this data will help in establishing diagnostic perfusion&#xD;
      value thresholds to be used in a subsequent interventional study confirming the efficacy of&#xD;
      NIRS-based ACS monitoring.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Swelling builds up in a severely injured leg (for example, a broken leg). In up to 20% of&#xD;
      very bad injuries, the swelling can be so great that it acts to cut off blood supply to the&#xD;
      leg, strangulating it from the inside. When this occurs, it is called Acute Compartment&#xD;
      Syndrome (ACS). This is a painful and bad situation, which needs to be diagnosed and then&#xD;
      surgically treated in an urgent fashion. Currently, the standard way most physicians diagnose&#xD;
      ACS is by clinical examination. By asking the patient questions, moving and inspecting the&#xD;
      patient's leg and typically inserting a needle in the patient's legs to measure the amount of&#xD;
      pressure in each leg. Physicians compile this information and make the final diagnosis. This&#xD;
      method of diagnosis can be painful and requires measurements, sometimes invasive, to be made&#xD;
      at points in time. ACS is a disease process that develops over time therefore someone may not&#xD;
      have ACS at the time of examination, but may develop it several hours later. The treatment&#xD;
      for ACS is called a fasciotomy. This treatment involves making a large incision from the knee&#xD;
      to the ankle on each side of the lower leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NIRS device has already been cleared by the FDA for detecting blood flow to the brain&#xD;
      during anesthesia. NIRS may also be helpful in diagnosing ACS. Two of the primary advantages&#xD;
      of this device are that it is noninvasive (not painful) and it collects data continuously, so&#xD;
      that if the disease develops, it can be detected early and treated appropriately. In order to&#xD;
      prove this, the device must first be tested by taking a series of measurements on people that&#xD;
      are uninjured (control groups), those with serious leg injuries (investigational groups), and&#xD;
      people in a critically injured state, but without leg injuries (critical controls).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to collect the information necessary to understand and then create&#xD;
      decision-making guidelines that use NIRS monitoring to diagnose and direct treatment for ACS.&#xD;
      Information for this study will be collected in the hospital. The study participants will be&#xD;
      grouped into 2 categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: Patients who are critically injured, but have no lower leg injuries Cohort 2:&#xD;
      Patients who have lower leg injuries that fall into certain high-energy categories (see&#xD;
      Eligibility Criteria, Section 7.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study, which means the data collected is not intended to impact the&#xD;
      patient's course of care. At all points in time, treatment will be directed by the patient's&#xD;
      doctor including decisions regarding operative care, non-operative care and in-patient&#xD;
      management. In fact, this study will be blinded, which means that the doctor treating the&#xD;
      study patients will not be able to see the NIRS values. This study will enroll approximately&#xD;
      120 subjects over three sites: Athens Regional Medical Center, Atlanta Medical Center, and&#xD;
      Grady Memorial Hospital, over a period of approximately 18 months. Participation will last&#xD;
      for 48 hours, unless the patient develops signs of compartment syndrome in which case&#xD;
      monitoring may be extended up to 72 hours or until completion of an assessment after the&#xD;
      patient is treated for ACS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Beyond the standard of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient interview to collect information on medical history, medications, and mechanism&#xD;
           of injury&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Photograph(s) will be taken to document NIRS pad placement over muscle compartments and&#xD;
           injury severity (face will not be included).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Ultrasound measure of the thickness of the fat layer (BX 2000) to detect the distance&#xD;
           from the patient's skin surface to the underlying muscle&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Light scan measurement of skin color (Dermaspectrometer) to see if the patient's skin&#xD;
           color affects NIRS readings&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Near-infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS) to measure patient's muscle oxygen levels. These&#xD;
           devices are completely noninvasive, which means there are no sharp or painful portions&#xD;
           of the device or measurement process. The NIRS device uses a small pad, like an EKG pad,&#xD;
           that sticks to the patient's skin and gives off a harmless, painless light that can&#xD;
           continually measure the patient's muscle oxygen level. These measures are recorded in&#xD;
           the monitor and will later be downloaded and used to evaluate the device's ability to&#xD;
           detect critical changes in muscle oxygen levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard of care:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Data will be recorded from the patient's medical record based on procedures ordered by&#xD;
           the patient's provider, including: lab values, Stryker measurements, vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Among Cohort 2 patients, data associated with some surgical procedures will be collected&#xD;
           and recorded in the operating room. This will be data that is gathered as standard of&#xD;
           care, such as blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of this information will be kept private and secure, and no sensitive information will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
