    <textblock>
      This study hopes to improve the investigators understanding of how the immune system acts in&#xD;
      allergic contact dermatitis. In order to reach this goal, normal volunteers, who are&#xD;
      suspected of having allergic contact dermatitis, will be patch tested for the fifteen most&#xD;
      common allergens. Then, biopsies will be taken of the skin at the sites where the there is a&#xD;
      positive reaction to the allergen. Also, small biopsies will be taken from an area that&#xD;
      received a patch but no allergen and an area that did not receive a patch to serve as&#xD;
      controls. In a second stage of the study, volunteers will receive patches with the allergen&#xD;
      to which they demonstrated an allergic response. More biopsies will be taken, over three&#xD;
      designated time points. The biopsied skin samples will then be studied in a laboratory.&#xD;

      Allergic contact dermatitis is a term for a skin reaction resulting from exposure to specific&#xD;
      substances that come into contact with skin that is hypersensitive (allergic) to the&#xD;
      substance. These substances are called &quot;allergens.&quot; Some common allergens are nickel, rubber,&#xD;
      dyes, poison ivy, poison oak and other related plants. These allergens do not cause a skin&#xD;
      reaction in most individuals, but for some, once the skin becomes sensitive or allergic to&#xD;
      the substance, any exposure to that specific allergen will produce a rash that may consist of&#xD;
      redness, swelling and blisters. This rash may become worse with each exposure to the&#xD;
      allergen. The skin reaction results from two phases. In the induction phase, initial exposure&#xD;
      to the allergen occurs. The body recognizes the allergen as foreign and the immune system,&#xD;
      which is the body's primary line of defense against infections and other things perceived as&#xD;
      foreign to the body, mounts an immune response against the body, itself. During this immune&#xD;
      response, cells specific to the allergen are activated. In the second phase, the elicitation&#xD;
      phase, the skin is again exposed to the allergen and an immune response occurs, as the cells&#xD;
      that are specific to the allergen attack the skin, leading to the rash. In order to diagnose&#xD;
      allergic contact dermatitis, a clinician will discuss the materials that touch the patient's&#xD;
      skin at work and home and perform patch tests. In a patch test, a very small amount of the&#xD;
      suspected allergens are applied to the skin for a fixed time. After that designated time, the&#xD;
      clinician will determine whether a reaction has occurred to the applied allergens. Currently,&#xD;
      the main treatment for allergic contact dermatitis is avoidance of the allergen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study hopes to improve our understanding of how the immune system acts in allergic&#xD;
      contact dermatitis. In order to reach this goal, normal volunteers, who are suspected of&#xD;
      having allergic contact dermatitis, will be patch tested for the fifteen most common&#xD;
      allergens. Then, biopsies will be taken of the skin at the sites where the there is a&#xD;
      positive reaction to the allergen. Also, small biopsies will be taken from an area that&#xD;
      received a patch but no allergen and an area that did not receive a patch to serve as&#xD;
      controls. In a second stage of the study, volunteers will receive patches with the allergen&#xD;
      to which they demonstrated an allergic response. More biopsies will be taken, over three&#xD;
      designated time points. The biopsied skin samples will then be studied in a laboratory by&#xD;
      methods such as immunohistochemistry and microarray analysis, which will help define the&#xD;
      progression of the immune reaction in allergic contact dermatitis. The rationale for the&#xD;
      study is to better understand how the immune system is activated to produce the rash of&#xD;
      allergic contact dermatitis, so that treatments can target the cells that are involved in the&#xD;
      activation.&#xD;

    <description>Skin samples will be analyzed by immunohistochemistry for various cell types including several T cell subsets (CD4+ vs CD8+ and Foxp3+ subsets), dendritic cells, natural killer cells, macrophages, B cells, and neutrophils. Expression of cytokine mRNAs in these samples will be used to assess Th1 (interferon-gamma), Th2 (IL-4, IL-13),Th17 (IL-17), and Th22 (IL-22) T cell activation.</description>
