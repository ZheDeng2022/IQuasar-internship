      This proposal is focused on developing a reliable, valid, and reproducible imaging techniques&#xD;
      and statistical methodology for segregation of various forms of Parkinsonism from healthy&#xD;
      adults without Parkinsonism. We focus on early diagnosis of Parkinsonism, other tremor&#xD;
      disorders, and determine how imaging might be used to improve diagnosis. The purpose of this&#xD;
      protocol is to gather a multi-modal dataset to explore and validate the investigator's&#xD;
      previous research findings in prior studies.&#xD;

        Subjects with PD, MSA-P, ET, or PSP will be recruited based on clinical criteria from the&#xD;
        UAB Comprehensive Parkinson Disease and Movement Disorder Clinic located at The Kirklin&#xD;
        Clinic at UAB. This center sees over 3,500 patients annually. Individuals with RBD will be&#xD;
        recruited from the UAB University Hospital and UAB Highlands Sleep Disorders Center and&#xD;
        will be identified through patient contact with a UAB Department of Neurology physician.&#xD;
