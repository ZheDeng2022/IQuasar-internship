      The primary objective of the study is to compare the tolerance and safety between a low-dose&#xD;
      Zidovudine (AZT) containing regimen (200 mg BID) and a standard dosage (300 mg BID) in HIV&#xD;
      patients initiating a first line antiretroviral therapy. The investigators expect that the&#xD;
      low-dose regimen will show improved tolerability and safety compared to the standard dosage,&#xD;
      with significant reduction in number of patients experiencing a new grade 1 to 4 anaemia or&#xD;
      increasing their anaemia grade during the first 6 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study is to compare the efficacy of the two dosing regimen,&#xD;
      as measured by classical clinical and biological markers: the number of new AIDS defining&#xD;
      illness, the mortality rate, the proportion of patients achieving virological success and the&#xD;
      mean CD4 cell count increase from baseline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Existing formulations for adults include zidovudine 100mg capsule, zidovudine/3TC 300/150mg,&#xD;
      zidovudine/3TC/NVP 300/150/200mg, zidovudine/3TC/ABC 300/150/300. Currently, international&#xD;
      guidelines recommend a daily dose of 600 mg in 2 divided doses. Pharmacokinetic studies on&#xD;
      zidovudine showed a twice daily regimen resulted in higher predose zidovudine-triphosphates&#xD;
      (TP) concentrations, the active intracellular metabolite, when compared to the same daily&#xD;
      dose given once daily. Further, a small study in Thailand study found doses of zidovudine 200&#xD;
      mg twice daily achieved plasma levels equivalent to the standard international 300 mg twice&#xD;
      daily dose in individuals weighing less than 60 kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical efficacy of zidovudine has been evaluated in randomized clinical trials using a&#xD;
      range of doses from 300 to 1500 mg/day. In an early trial (Nordic Medical Research Councils'&#xD;
      HIV Therapy Group 1992) comparing different dosing of zidovudine monotherapy in advanced HIV&#xD;
      infection found no differences in death rate, or new AIDS defining events. The incidence of&#xD;
      anaemia and leucopenia comparing 400 mg and 1200 mg daily showed a direct dose relationship:&#xD;
      4% to 24% (anaemia) and 3% to 22% (leucopenia) respectively. Another early trial (Fischl&#xD;
      1990) demonstrated an improved survival with the lower dose of zidovudine (63%) versus the&#xD;
      high dose (52%), again with significantly more anaemia and neutropenia in the high dose&#xD;
      zidovudine arm (p &lt; 0.001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      High doses of zidovudine have led to increased incidence of anaemia and neutropenia, with no&#xD;
      impairment in treatment efficacy as measured by CD4 cell count, HIV RNA level or clinical&#xD;
      progression. In the context of new recommendations favouring the use of zidovudine over&#xD;
      stavudine as first line treatment in resource limited settings, the investigators aim at&#xD;
      evaluating the impact of reduced zidovudine (200 mg BID) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      API (active product ingredient) production costs are the most important determinant of&#xD;
      antiretroviral drug prices among generic manufacturers. A given percentage reduction in&#xD;
      dosage will thus translate into a virtually equivalent percentage in drug pricing. As cART&#xD;
      will continue to expand in Least Developed Countries, it is predicted that around 1.5 million&#xD;
      people will take zidovudine-based regimen by 2010. Small reductions in the annual per-patient&#xD;
      cost of AZT-based regimen could lead to significant reductions in the global cost of HIV&#xD;
      treatment: it is estimated a 47 million US dollars savings if 9 million patients will be&#xD;
      treated in 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a prospective, randomised, 48 weeks, phase II trial. Subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited through one site: the HIV outpatient clinic of Internal Medicine Department, CNPS&#xD;
      Hospital, Yaoundé, Cameroun. Randomisation will be performed at initiation of ART. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomised in one of the following treatments arms, in combination with lamivudine&#xD;
      and an NNRTI regimen: a low-dose AZT arm (200 mg twice daily)or a standard-dose AZT arm (300&#xD;
      mg twice daily).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the comparison of proportions of patients experiencing a new grade 1&#xD;
      to 4 anaemia or increasing their anaemia grade between the two dosing AZT regimen during the&#xD;
      first six months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary endpoints are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mean haemoglobin concentration and leukocyte count changes, laboratory grade 3 and 4&#xD;
           adverse events rate leading or not to switch for another cART regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Differences in proportion of patients achieving virological success (VL &lt;50 cop/ml)&#xD;
           between the two dosing zidovudine regimen at week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in proportion of patients achieving virological success ( VL &lt;400 cop/ml)&#xD;
           between the two dosing zidovudine regimen at week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in mean viral load decline between the two groups at week 4 and 8&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in mean CD4 cell count increase from baseline between the two dosing&#xD;
           zidovudine regimen at week 8, 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in proportion of patients with genotype mutations in patient with detectable&#xD;
           viral load at week 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of new AIDS defining illness, mortality rate, drop-out rate will be compared&#xD;
           between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed individually 24 weeks for the entire period of experimental&#xD;
      treatment. After the follow-up period, all patients included in the low dose AZT arm will be&#xD;
      treated with standard AZT dose. They will keep their routine follow-up at the CNPS hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the first 68 patients included (half of the total cohort) in the study, the Data Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Board (DSMB, independently of the clinical investigators) will undergo an interim&#xD;
      analysis at week 8 of follow-up before continuing enrollment. In this sample of patients, the&#xD;
      efficacy of two treatment groups will be compared: an excess of 15% virological treatment&#xD;
      failure in the low-dose AZT arm will be considered as significant. Virological treatment&#xD;
      failure at this point is defined as a decline in viral load from baseline to the 8th week of&#xD;
      less than 2log.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An incidence of 30% of patients experiencing new grade 1 to 4 anaemia or increasing their&#xD;
      anaemia grade during the first 6 months of treatment is expected with the standard AZT dose&#xD;
      regimen. A reduction of this adverse event to 10% of the patients treated by the low dose&#xD;
      regimen would be considered as clinically significant. Thus, with a 10% of LFU expected&#xD;
      during the follow-up period, the investigators calculate a sample size of 68 patients in each&#xD;
      arm to detect a clinically significant difference between the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The percentage of patients experiencing a new grade 1 to 4 anaemia or increasing their&#xD;
      anaemia grade will be compared between both treatment arms using the difference of proportion&#xD;
      observed (Chi2 test or Fisher exact test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same method will be used to compare all the efficacy and safety indicators. Multivariate&#xD;
      analysis will be used to obtain adjusted estimates of risk factors for treatment failure and&#xD;
      for clinically significant adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis on treatment safety and efficacy will be performed both in 'intention to treat&quot; and&#xD;
      in &quot;per protocol&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An &quot;intention to treat&quot; analysis will include patients enrolled in the study who received at&#xD;
      least one dose of study medication to which they were randomly allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A &quot;per protocol&quot; analysis will include patients enrolled in the study who received at least&#xD;
      one dose of study medication to which they were randomly allocated AND have reached one of&#xD;
      the protocol defined treatment failure endpoints (death, lost to follow-up, virological&#xD;
      failure) on the treatment they were randomly allocated or have completed the trial follow-up&#xD;
      on the treatment they were randomly allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for the termination of the trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Too low enrollment rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unsafe or unethical practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following the recommendation of the DSMB. The sponsor and investigators will ensure that&#xD;
           this study is conducted in full compliance with the principles of the &quot;Declaration of&#xD;
           Helsinki&quot; or with the laws and regulations of the country in which the research is&#xD;
           conducted, whichever affords the greater protection to the individual. The study must&#xD;
           fully adhere to the principles outlined in &quot;Guideline for Good Clinical Practice&quot; ICH&#xD;
           Tripartite Guideline (E6, June 1996) or with local law if it affords greater protection&#xD;
           to the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with the ethical principles laid out in the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki and the National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Research Involving&#xD;
      Humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
