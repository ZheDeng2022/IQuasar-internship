      This is a open-label non-randomized, dose escalation and expansion Phase Ia/Ib study to&#xD;
      determine the safety, tolerability and maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of pazopanib in&#xD;
      combination with PCI-24781 in patients with advanced solid tumors.&#xD;

      Study rationale/purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pazopanib is a potent, multi-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor44 of VEGFR-1, -2, -3, PDGFR-α&#xD;
      and -β and c-kit approved for metastatic renal cell carcinoma based on phase III data showing&#xD;
      a significant prolongation of progression-free survival (PFS) (5 mos in pretreated patients&#xD;
      and 8.3 mos in treatment-naïve patients). In addition recent data was presented this year,&#xD;
      but is not yet published, with treatment-refractory sarcoma patients that showed a PFS was&#xD;
      significantly prolonged from a median of 20 vs. 7 weeks. As can occur with all antiangiogenic&#xD;
      agents, resistance to pazopanib may develop. Epigenetic modification with HDAC inhibitors may&#xD;
      overcome drug resistance by causing an increase in accessibility of DNA to chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents and may therefore significantly potentiate their cytotoxicity. Combination trials with&#xD;
      chemotherapy agents are ongoing (ClinicalTrials.gov) To our knowledge, a combination trial of&#xD;
      HDACi with anti-angiogenesis agents has not yet been performed and represents an unmet&#xD;
      medical need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PCI-24781 is a pan HDAC inhibitor. In cell lines tested, up-regulation and down-regulation of&#xD;
      genes known to result in changes with signal transduction, oxidation, metabolic changes,&#xD;
      apoptosis, proliferation, differentiation and angiogenesis were seen. In addition, ongoing&#xD;
      single agent and combination trials have shown the drug to be effective and well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Combining an antiangiogenic agent, such as pazopanib, with an epigenetic&#xD;
      modifier, such as histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) PCI-24781, can increase the efficacy&#xD;
      of pazopanib as well as overcome development of resistance to pazopanib.&#xD;
