      Site of research: Helsinki University Central Hospital (HUCH), Department of Obstetrics and&#xD;
      Gynaecology and University of Helsinki Department of Psychology, in collaboration with&#xD;
      Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm, Sweden&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Finland and in Sweden, fear of childbirth is one of the most common reasons for&#xD;
      consultation of obstetrician, and for an elective caesarean section. Approximately 5 to 6% of&#xD;
      pregnant women suffer from severe fear of childbirth, which disturbs family-life and working&#xD;
      and prevents the preparation to normal childbirth and parenthood. It represents as&#xD;
      nightmares, panic attacks, anxiety, and as numerous physical complaints. After giving birth&#xD;
      it can be difficult for these women to form an early mother-infant-relationship. Their risk&#xD;
      for puerperal depression is also increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finland and Sweden have both a long tradition in research of this field. In Finland, the&#xD;
      investigators research group started the first out-patient clinic for fearful pregnant women&#xD;
      in HUCH in1996. Different strategies how to treat fear of childbirth have been applied to&#xD;
      clinical practise. Studies on the treatment for fear of childbirth are, however, scanty. Some&#xD;
      descriptive studies have showed that far more than one half of patients can, after the&#xD;
      treatment, prepare to a normal vaginal delivery and caesarean without a medical indication&#xD;
      can be avoided. The aim of the treatment should be both to avoid unnecessary caesareans,&#xD;
      increase the number of uneventful vaginal deliveries and to help the pregnant couple to&#xD;
      prepare to parenthood, as well as to prevent puerperal depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, psychotherapeutic group psychoeducation is studied as promising treatment for&#xD;
      severe fear of childbirth. To screen fear of childbirth, all women coming to ultrasound&#xD;
      screening at the 18 to 20 gestational week in HUCH are asked to fill in a specific&#xD;
      questionnaire. Those nulliparous women whose score for fear exceeds 95th percentile are&#xD;
      randomized to intervention and to control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group is invited to start a psychotherapeutic group therapy based on&#xD;
      cognitive and psychodynamic therapy combined with training in relaxation. Each group consists&#xD;
      of six nulliparous women and meets six times during pregnancy 120 minutes at a time. Between&#xD;
      the sessions the patients fill in a homework questionnaire. One session focuses on the&#xD;
      partner's role and the partners are present then. Three months after delivery, the groups&#xD;
      meet once more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women in the control group stay in the care of community midwives and general physicians.&#xD;
      If needed, they are referred to out-patient clinic in the maternity hospital where their fear&#xD;
      is treated according the clinical practice of that hospital, mainly support from obstetrician&#xD;
      or midwife.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women and their partners in both groups are asked, approximately one month after the&#xD;
      screening and one month before the due date of delivery, to fill in the questionnaires&#xD;
      examining depression, self-esteem, general anxiety, social support, marital satisfaction,&#xD;
      personal projects and concerns, and efficacy concerning childbirth and maternity. After&#xD;
      childbirth, data about the childbirth will be collected. Three months and two years after&#xD;
      childbirth mothers and fathers in both groups receive again a psychosocial questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to help the authorities to organize the treatment for fear of&#xD;
      childbirth in their districts by examining the benefits of the treatment also in long-run.&#xD;
      The investigators hope the results would lead to production of Current Care guidelines for&#xD;
      fear of childbirth.&#xD;
