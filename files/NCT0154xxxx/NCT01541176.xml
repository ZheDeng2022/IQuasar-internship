  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to demonstrate that the absence of post-transplantation&#xD;
      corticosteroids does not induce a larger increase of renal graft fibrosis (by numerical&#xD;
      reading) on biopsy at one year post-transplantation than immunosuppressive treatment strategy&#xD;
      that includes standard oral corticosteroids.The secondary objectives of the study consist to&#xD;
      compare on various parameters (fibrosis progression, renal function, dialysis, ratio of&#xD;
      proteinuria/creatinuria, acute rejection, donor-specific antibody, graft survival, clinical&#xD;
      and biological tolerance) therapy with no corticosteroids post-transplantation in comparison&#xD;
      to standard immunosuppressive treatment strategies including oral corticosteroids. Secondary&#xD;
      objectives of the study consist also to compare the two techniques for assessing fibrosis by&#xD;
      numerical reading and by centralized blinded reading of the treatment group (by 2 anatomical&#xD;
      pathologists).&#xD;
