      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate tumour pathological complete response rate after six&#xD;
      cycles of neoadjuvant docetaxel and cyclophosphamide in an Asian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacogenomics (PG) of docetaxel cyclophosphamide in Asian&#xD;
           patients,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety and toxicity of docetaxel cyclophosphamide in Asian patients, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine efficacy of short course (3 days) filgrastim in primary and secondary&#xD;
           prophylaxis against febrile neutropenia in patients receiving docetaxel and&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide.&#xD;

      Study Design and Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simon Optimal two-stage Phase II design will be used for this trial. With a null hypothesis&#xD;
      of p0=5% and an alternative hypothesis of p1=20%, significance level, α=5% and power,&#xD;
      (1-β)=90%, a total of 41 patients will be required, with 21 patients to be recruited for the&#xD;
      first stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, 21 to 41 patients will be recruited at National Cancer Centre Singapore over 36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with newly diagnosed, histological confirmed HER-2 negative clinically node positive&#xD;
      or locally advanced (cT3-T4, N0-3 or cTx, T0-4, N2-N3) primary breast cancer without evidence&#xD;
      of metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage/ Dosage Form, Route and Dose Regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Node Positive or Locally Advanced HER2 Negative Breast Cancer proceed to Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 +&#xD;
      Cyclophosphamide 600 mg/m2 q21 days x 6 proceed to surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: cyclophosphamide is administered by intravenous infusion over 10 minutes followed by&#xD;
      docetaxel over 90 minutes Patients will receive further chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine&#xD;
      therapy and targeted therapy as per institutional guidelines after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with clinical non-response after 4 cycles of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide are most&#xD;
      unlikely to have a pathological complete response. Hence, discontinuation of study and cross&#xD;
      over to an anthracycline based chemotherapy is allowed at that point at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating oncologist. These patients will be classified as pathological non complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with progressive disease at any time will discontinue study treatment and receive&#xD;
      salvage therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathological response will be assessed by evaluation of resected surgical specimen after&#xD;
      completion of protocol treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status, adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs), serial laboratory safety tests. Proportion of patients with febrile neutropenia&#xD;
      despite primary prophylactic G-CSF will be reviewed when 6,12 ,18, 24 and 30 patients have&#xD;
      been accrued. Increase in number of doses of primary prophylactic G-CSF will be implemented&#xD;
      if the lower limit of the 95% confidence interval of proportion exceeds 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who have received at least 1 dose of study treatment will be included in the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic (PK), Pharmacogenetic (PG) and Correlative Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained for future analysis of any stored preoperative tumour biopsy&#xD;
      specimens for possible gene expression profiles predictive of docetaxel and cyclophosphamide.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo blood sampling for docetaxel and cyclophosphamide PK studies on cycle 1&#xD;
      day 1 (see page 22 for detailed timing). Whole blood will be collected at baseline for&#xD;
      genotyping for CYP3A4, CYP3A5, CYP2B6, CYP2C19, ALDH, GST, ABCB1, SLCO1B3, PXR, CAR, HNF4α&#xD;
      genes&#xD;
&#xD;
      ALL PATIENTS WITH SERIOUS ADVERSE EVENTS MUST BE FOLLOWED UP FOR OUTCOME.&#xD;

             node positive breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;21 years. Because no dosing or adverse event data are currently available on the&#xD;
             use of docetaxel in patients &lt;21 years of age, children are excluded from this study&#xD;
             but will be eligible for future pediatric phase 2 combination trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of greater than 10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status &lt;2 (Karnofsky &gt;60%; see Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have normal organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  leukocytes &gt;3,000/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  absolute neutrophil count &gt;1,500/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  platelets &gt;100,000/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) &lt;2.5 X institutional upper limit of normal&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  creatinine within normal institutional limits OR&#xD;

               -  creatinine clearance &gt;40 mL/min for patients if creatinine levels above&#xD;
                  institutional normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of docetaxel on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic&#xD;
             dose are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior&#xD;
             to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a woman become&#xD;
             pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should&#xD;
             inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HER2 positive breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had any chemotherapy or radiotherapy prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to docetaxel, cyclophosphamide, lenograstim or filgrastim.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of pre-existing peripheral neuropathy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because chemotherapy in general including&#xD;
             docetaxel and cyclophosphamide used in this study are pregnancy class D agents with&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown&#xD;
             but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the&#xD;
             mother with chemotherapy, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with chemotherapy. These potential risks may also apply to other agents used&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients receiving&#xD;
             combination anti-retroviral therapy are excluded from the study because of possible&#xD;
             pharmacokinetic interactions with chemotherapy or other agents administered during the&#xD;
             study. Appropriate studies will be undertaken in patients receiving combination&#xD;
             anti-retroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with prior malignancies are excluded except for basal cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin and carcinoma in-situ of the cervix who have received curative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Both men and women of all races and ethnic groups are eligible for this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Protocol precautions and restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant or actively breast feeding are not eligible to participate&#xD;
             in this study as stated in 3.2.8. Female patients of child bearing potential will be&#xD;
             required to use reliable methods of contraception for the duration of the study and&#xD;
             until 4 weeks after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
