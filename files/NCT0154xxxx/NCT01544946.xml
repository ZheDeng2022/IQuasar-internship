      Background: Early recognition and treatment of pain among children is important for their&#xD;
      cognitive development and their future response to pain throughout their life. Oral sweet&#xD;
      solutions have been accepted as effective pain reducing agents for procedures in the neonatal&#xD;
      population. To date, there have been a limited number of published clinical trials in an&#xD;
      emergency setting studying this type of intervention among infants undergoing venous puncture&#xD;
      and bladder catheterization. These studies have reported conflicting results. No previous&#xD;
      studies have evaluated the utilization of sucrose to manage pain during nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      aspiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To compare the efficacy of an oral sucrose solution versus placebo in reducing&#xD;
      pain in children one to three months of age during nasopharyngeal aspiration in the Emergency&#xD;
      Department.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION AND JUSTIFICATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pain is one of the most common adverse stimuli experienced by children, occurring as a&#xD;
      result of injury, illness, and necessary medical procedures1. The American Academy of&#xD;
      Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Pain Society (APS) have jointly issued a statement&#xD;
      promoting the responsibility of paediatricians as leaders and advocates to ensure the humane&#xD;
      and competent treatment of pain and suffering in all infants, children, and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term effects of unmanaged pain in human infants have been shown to include permanent&#xD;
      impairment of elements of cognitive development, such as learning, memory, and behavior, and&#xD;
      increased somatisation in childhood. The plasticity of the developing brain and the changes&#xD;
      that occur in response to painful stimuli also contribute to altered perceptions of pain&#xD;
      later in life. Early painful experiences affect children's future responses to analgesia.&#xD;
      Weisman et al found that inadequate analgesia in young children during procedures diminished&#xD;
      the effects of adequate analgesia during subsequent procedures. Many studies have suggested&#xD;
      that the prompt and accurate recognition and treatment of pain in young infants is important&#xD;
      for their immediate comfort and for their best possible lifelong development. Despite the&#xD;
      recent interest in paediatric pain assessment, prevention and treatment, many children do not&#xD;
      receive adequate management to alleviate pain. The ideal pre-procedural analgesic agent for&#xD;
      minor invasive procedures would be a cost-effective, inexpensive, short-acting agent with few&#xD;
      associated risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of sucrose has been well studied for certain procedures in the patients of the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit and in the newborn nursery settings, particularly for venous&#xD;
      blood draws, capillary blood tests and circumcision. In these studies, infants receiving oral&#xD;
      sucrose solutions before procedures cried less and had overall decreased behavioral pain&#xD;
      responses when compared with those receiving placebo. Furthermore, sucrose has been shown to&#xD;
      be a safe intervention with no serious life-threatening adverse events and only few reported&#xD;
      side effects consisting of minimal coughing with administration. Sucrose is inexpensive,&#xD;
      short acting, non-sedating, easily administered and non-invasive. Administration of sucrose&#xD;
      does not require additional training and does not expose the infant to risks greater than&#xD;
      those associated with breast or bottle feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasopharyngeal aspiration (NPA) is a common procedure in the Emergency Department (ED),&#xD;
      especially during wintertime. It is also a recognized way to support small children with&#xD;
      bronchiolitis or upper respiratory viral illness. There is currently a paucity of literature&#xD;
      about the perception of pain or discomfort during nasopharyngeal aspiration. Macfarlane and&#xD;
      al. compared nasal swab versus nasopharyngeal aspirate for RSV testing in children of 1 month&#xD;
      to 20 months. Infant distress was measured using a facial, cry, and movement scoring scale&#xD;
      (FLACC). A median score of six was obtaining in the group of nasopharyngeal aspirate in&#xD;
      comparison of median score of cinq for nasal swab (p&lt;0,0001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sucrose administered by non-nutritive sucking two minutes prior to the procedure is now&#xD;
      recognized as a safe16 and efficient way to relieve pain for minor procedures in the neonatal&#xD;
      intensive care unit (NICU). It can contribute to decrease the physiologic response to a&#xD;
      painful stimulus (heart rate, respiratory rate and decrease in oxygensaturation) as well as&#xD;
      attenuate pain behaviors and decrease the overall score in pain scales. Since 1998, the&#xD;
      Cochrane Database Review recommends the use of sucrose for procedural pain in the neonatal&#xD;
      population. The latest edition (2010) provides sufficient evidence to recommend the use of&#xD;
      sucrose for single heel lance punctures and its consideration for venipuncture. Authors&#xD;
      conclude that further studies are needed to extend the use of sucrose to some other neonatal&#xD;
      common but painful procedures such as bladder catheterization, nasogastric tube insertion and&#xD;
      suctioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies about the use of sucrose for relieving pain in routine immunizations suggest that&#xD;
      analgesic properties can have an effect beyond infancy, despite upper age of this limit and&#xD;
      appropriate concentration or quantity of sucrose are unknown for this age group. Randomized&#xD;
      controlled trials in EDs introduced the use of sucrose for venipuncture or bladder&#xD;
      catheterization for older infants. Curtis and al demonstrated a trend toward reducing pain in&#xD;
      children of zero to six months of age using sucrose during venipuncture. However the benefit&#xD;
      seemed to be limited to infants less than three months old with no significant variation in&#xD;
      pain scale scores beyond this age (three to six months). In a second study, Rogers and al.&#xD;
      showed that using sucrose while an infant undergoes bladder catheterization reduced&#xD;
      variations in pain scale scores and enhanced a quicker return to baseline for infants of 1 to&#xD;
      30 days of life, while infants in the group of 30 to 90 days failed to demonstrate this&#xD;
      relation. No specific study was found about pain management during nasopharyngeal aspiration&#xD;
      in infants in ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, studies have used varieties of concentrations of sucrose ranging from 24% to 75%.&#xD;
      Systematic reviews of the current literature have been unable to demonstrate superiority of&#xD;
      one concentration of a sweet solution over another21-25, but many studies suggested that&#xD;
      higher concentrations of sweet solutions seemed more effective. Therefore, the investigators&#xD;
      chose to study the effect of a sweet solution named syrup B.P. (product by Laboratoire Atlas&#xD;
      inc.) which contains 88% of sucrose. This solution is already commonly used in the population&#xD;
      of infants up to three months of age and it is safe (e.g. prednisone syrup or codeine syrup&#xD;
      are made using this syrup). A two milliliters dose of 88% sucrose contains the same amount of&#xD;
      carbohydrates as 25 milliliters of infant milk formulas which contain approximately 7,5g/100&#xD;
      milliliters 30. Also, 88% sucrose has the same sugar concentration as many other medications&#xD;
      which are commonly used in infants, such as oral antibiotics, oral steroid solutions and&#xD;
      other pain medications (e.g. codeine syrup). This syrup is of particular interest as it is of&#xD;
      low cost ($9,58 for a bottle of 2000 milliliters), universally available, stable and viable&#xD;
      for approximately three months. Therefore, the procedure studied here would be easy to apply&#xD;
      in most clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the painful procedure chosen for the study is nasopharyngeal aspiration. This&#xD;
      procedure is frequently performed in the ED in this age group, particularly in the winter&#xD;
      either as a therapeutic or diagnostic procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, there are no pain scales which have been validated precisely for the age group&#xD;
      studied in this project. However, the Face, Legs, Activity, Cry and Consolability (FLACC)&#xD;
      scale is recommended by the IMMPACT group (Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain&#xD;
      Assessment in Clinical Trials). FLACC is an easily applicable pain scale in which the&#xD;
      observer scores a patient on five categories, from zero to two points, for a total score of&#xD;
      maximum 10 points. The validity and reliability of this pain scale has been established in&#xD;
      the past for children from 2 months to 7 years. Validity was evaluated by comparing the FLACC&#xD;
      scale with the Objective Pain Scale and demonstrated that both tools showed similar&#xD;
      behaviours (r=0.80; p&lt;0.001). The interrater reliability between two observers was considered&#xD;
      good (r[87]=0.94; p&lt;0.001) with a kappa value greater than 0,50 for each category. Therefore,&#xD;
      this pain scale was chosen as the measure of the investigators primary outcome, in this&#xD;
      population of infants from one to three months old. Furthermore, the Neonatal Infant Pain&#xD;
      Scale (NIPS)is a well validated pain scale for newborns up to one month of age. This pain&#xD;
      scale was chosen as a secondary outcome. The investigators hypothesize that using one pain&#xD;
      scale validated in infants up to 1 month of age and another validated in infants older than&#xD;
      two months of age will allow us to assess pain in infants from one to three months of age&#xD;
      best, given current available tools. Furthermore, several other patient parameters will be&#xD;
      used to corroborate findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that providing an oral sucrose solution during nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      aspiration will decrease pain levels in infants one to three months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators primary objective is to compare the efficacy an oral 88% sucrose solution&#xD;
      to a placebo solution in reducing pain as assessed by the FLACC scale in children of one to&#xD;
      three months during nasopharyngeal aspiration in the ED. The investigators secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to asses changes in pain levels as per the NIPS scores. The investigators will&#xD;
      also measure variations of heart rate and crying time. Any side effects will also be&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
