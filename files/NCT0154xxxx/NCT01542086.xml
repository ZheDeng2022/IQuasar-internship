      The investigators aim to compare the cost-effectiveness of CCTA and myocardial SPECT in&#xD;
      patients with intermediate pre-test probability of CHD. To this end, patients with&#xD;
      intermediate pre-test probability of CHD will be randomized 1:1 to either CCTA and myocardial&#xD;
      SPECT. The patients will be analyzed for cost and also, for outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of heart failure in Westernized countries&#xD;
      and accounts for one of the most common cause of mortality in Korea. More importantly, the&#xD;
      nation's health cost is being more and more spent on the treatment of CHD. Therefore,&#xD;
      selecting the right patients for intervention is becoming more and more important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis and treatment strategy of CHD relies on both anatomic and functional imaging.&#xD;
      First, there should be a significant narrowing of a segment of the coronary artery and&#xD;
      second, there must also be evidence of ischemia due to the lesion. As a consequence of the&#xD;
      recent, rapid development and distribution of the high-resolution computed tomography (CT),&#xD;
      physicians are referring more and more patients for anatomic imaging of the coronary&#xD;
      vasculature with coronary CT angiography (CCTA). CCTA has the advantage of imaging the&#xD;
      coronary arteries noninvasively that is nearly as exact as conventional, invasive coronary&#xD;
      angiography. However, CCTA also has the possibility of overdiagnosing CHD, especially&#xD;
      intermediate lesions. This can be important give the recent outcome of the FAME study&#xD;
      demonstrating the inferiority of relying on only anatomic diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast, myocardial single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) has the advantage&#xD;
      of imaging ischemia more accurately, since it is more of a functional imaging than an&#xD;
      anatomical imaging. However, the sensitivity and specificity is less than 80%, which means&#xD;
      that a total of 20% of the patients can be false-negative or false-positive. In addition,&#xD;
      although it can demonstrate ischemia, it cannot provide where and how much the coronary&#xD;
      artery is stenotic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, van Werkhoven and Bax demonstrated that CCTA and myocardial SPECT may be&#xD;
      complementary. The study showed that patients with both abnormal CCTA and myocardial SPECT&#xD;
      results tend to be worse in terms of event-free survival than patients with either alone.&#xD;
      However, the nation's cost may be too burdenful if the patients are charged with both tests&#xD;
      together and thus, it is more critical to give information on the cost-effectiveness of both&#xD;
      of these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aim to compare the cost-effectiveness of CCTA and myocardial SPECT in&#xD;
      patients with intermediate pre-test probability of CHD. To this end, patients with&#xD;
      intermediate pre-test probability of CHD will be randomized 1:1 to either CCTA and myocardial&#xD;
      SPECT. The patients will be analyzed for cost and also, for outcome.&#xD;
