      Study Phase and Design Phase I with experimental malaria challenge. The study will enroll 30&#xD;
      healthy adult participants randomized to one of three cohorts comprised of six groups of 5&#xD;
      individuals per group to simultaneously receive PfSPZ Challenge via the ID route. The goal&#xD;
      will be to determine the optimal dose required to achieve 100% infectivity (ID100) of adult&#xD;
      volunteers. The parameters of 1) dose (number of sporozoites) 2) number of injections and 3)&#xD;
      aliquot volume will be studied; adding to previous data collected at the University of&#xD;
      Nijmegen. The following single time point inoculation regimens (a-f) will be assessed: Cohort&#xD;
      1: Medium dose, medium aliquot volume: a. 10,000 PfSPZ ID in 2 divided doses of 50 microliter&#xD;
      aliquot volume b. 10,000 PfSPZ ID in 8 divided doses of 50 microliter aliquot volume Cohort&#xD;
      2: Medium dose, low aliquot volume: c. 10,000 PfSPZ ID in 2 divided doses of 10 microliter&#xD;
      aliquot volume d. 10,000 PfSPZ ID in 8 divided doses of 10 ml aliquot volume Cohort 3: High&#xD;
      dose, low aliquot volume: e. 50,000 PfSPZ ID in 2 divided doses of 10 ml aliquot volume f.&#xD;
      50,000 PfSPZ ID in 8 divided doses of 10 ml aliquot volume. Safety, tolerability and efficacy&#xD;
      of the inoculation regimens will be evaluated. All 30 volunteers will be evaluated as part of&#xD;
      an inpatient stay (Days 8-18 post-injection) to diagnose and treat Pf malaria infection with&#xD;
      chloroquine. Following review, and with the assistance of an independent SMC, 2 regimens will&#xD;
      be chosen for further testing in DMID 11-0042. The following criteria strategy will be&#xD;
      employed in the order listed: 1. Regimen necessary to achieve ID100 of adult volunteers; 2.&#xD;
      Regimen eliciting Pf patency and parasite density (as detected by qRT-PCR) that most closely&#xD;
      approximates patency rates experienced after mosquito challenge; 3. Regimen requiring the&#xD;
      least number of injections; 4. Regimen utilizing the fewest number of PfSPZ; 5. Volume of&#xD;
      administration considered to be the easiest to administer by the clinicians. Chloroquine&#xD;
      sub-study: Eighteen of thirty participants (3 volunteers from each of the six groups&#xD;
      comprised of 5-subjects/group) will be assigned to participate in a CQ and possibly&#xD;
      desethylchloroquine blood and urine study designed to assess the drug kinetics of CQ over the&#xD;
      course of four weeks after standard CQ dose administration.&#xD;

      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or nonpregnant female between the ages of 18 and 45 years, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Women who are not surgically sterile (no history of bilateral tubal ligation,&#xD;
             bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, or hysterectomy), post-menopausal (1 year without&#xD;
             menses) or determined otherwise by medical evaluation to be sterile must agree to&#xD;
             practice adequate contraception (such as double barrier methods (condoms plus foam or&#xD;
             spermicide, diaphragm plus foam or spermicide), licensed intrauterine devices (IUDs),&#xD;
             intravaginal or intra/transdermal or oral hormonal methods initiated at least 1 month&#xD;
             prior to inoculation or challenge, documented surgical sterilization via tubal&#xD;
             ligation the essure procedure or hysterectomy, abstinence or a vasectomized partner).&#xD;
             The contraceptive method should remain unchanged throughout the entire study period&#xD;
             (56 days). Serologic pregnancy tests will be conducted upon screening. Urine testing&#xD;
             will be done on the day of malaria challenge, on the day of the first positive malaria&#xD;
             smear and at the conclusion of active surveillance (Day 56).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Is in good health, as determined by vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, oral&#xD;
             temperature), medical history, screening 12-lead ECG and a physical examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has normal laboratory values (Urinalysis (assessing blood, and protein presence as&#xD;
             greater than trace by dipstick), hemoglobin, WBC, platelet count, AST, ALT, bilirubin,&#xD;
             glucose, and creatinine) prior to challenge study. Any abnormal screening value for&#xD;
             any screening test listed in Table 8 will exclude the participant from the study with&#xD;
             the exception of elevated fasting glucose and hematuria &gt;1+ detected during menses for&#xD;
             females. Elevated fasting glucose may need to be repeated due to recent carbohydrate&#xD;
             consumption and is therefore not a true fasting glucose. Subsequent repeat fasting&#xD;
             glucose testing that is in the normal range will be acceptable for participation. For&#xD;
             females who are menstruating, urinalysis frequently tests positive for blood and is&#xD;
             not an indicator of poor health status or increased risk. This can be repeated if&#xD;
             clinically warranted.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Able to understand and comply with planned study procedures including an inpatient&#xD;
             stay from Day 8-18 after malaria challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Provides informed consent prior to any study procedures, correctly answers &gt; 70% on&#xD;
             the post consent quiz and is available for all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Willing to avoid non-study related blood donation for 3 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        While not a formal exclusion criterion, the deltoid area of both arms will be assessed for&#xD;
        marks, burns and other skin damage. If, in the Investigator's opinion, assessment of local&#xD;
        reactions could be impaired, the subject may be excluded under criterion 23.&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Has any known history of malaria infection, is a long-term resident (&gt; 5 years) of a&#xD;
             malaria-endemic area, was born and resided in a malaria-endemic area, or has traveled&#xD;
             to a malaria-endemic area within the previous 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has a positive urine pregnancy test prior to malaria challenge (if female of&#xD;
             childbearing potential), is lactating, or has the intention to become pregnant within&#xD;
             2 months after enrollment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Use of any antibiotic (that has known or potential antimalarial properties) or&#xD;

             (kg/mm2), reported diabetes status (yes/no), current treatment for raised blood&#xD;
             pressure (yes/no).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Is immunosuppressed (e.g., poorly-controlled diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, renal&#xD;
             insufficiency, active malignancy, connective tissue disease, organ transplant) as a&#xD;
             result of an underlying illness or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. An abnormal ECG, defined as one showing pathologic Q waves and significant ST-T wave&#xD;
             changes; left ventricular hypertrophy; any non-sinus rhythm excluding isolated&#xD;

             steroids (&gt;800 micrograms/day of beclomethasone dipropionate or equivalent) or other&#xD;
             immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs (an exception includes asthma for which any oral&#xD;
             or inhaled steroid intake will mean exclusion from study enrollment).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Has a known history of human immunodeficiency virus, hepatitis B surface antigen&#xD;
             positivity, or Hepatitis C infection.&#xD;
