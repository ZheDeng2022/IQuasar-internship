  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 dose escalation study of an investigational agent, everolimus, given in&#xD;
      combination with standard radiation therapy, in prostate cancers with a rising PSA following&#xD;
      a prostatectomy. A maximum of 33 people will be enrolled on this study at the University of&#xD;
      Pennsylvania. The primary objective of this study is to determine the acute and chronic&#xD;
      toxicities and maximum tolerated dose of everolimus with concurrent radiation.&#xD;

             biochemical recurrence (defined as nadir + 2 rises measured at least 2 weeks apart)&#xD;
             and b). PSA doubling time of less than or equal to 6 months; OR c). persistently&#xD;
             elevated PSA(PSA post prostatectomy of 0.2 ng/mL if standard assay or greater than&#xD;
             0.05 if ultrasensitive PSA assay)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must be a candidate for salvage radiotherapy to the prostate bed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater or equal to 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status less than or equal to 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate liver and renal function Adequate renal function: serum creatinine 1.5 x ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must have archival prostate tumor block available for analysis of correlatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients currently receiving anticancer therapies or who have received anticancer&#xD;
             therapies within 4 weeks of the start of study drug (including chemotherapy, radiation&#xD;
             therapy, antibody based therapy, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients, who have had a major surgery or significant traumatic injury within 4 weeks&#xD;
             of start of study drug, patients who have not recovered from the side effects of any&#xD;
             major surgery (defined as requiring general anesthesia) or patients that may require&#xD;
             major surgery during the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with any investigational drug within the preceding 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving chronic, systemic treatment with corticosteroids or another&#xD;
             immunosuppressive agent. Topical or inhaled corticosteroids are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients should not receive immunization with attenuated liver vaccines within one&#xD;
             week of study entry or during study period. Close contact with those who have received&#xD;
             attenuated liver vaccines should be avoided during treatment with everolimus. Examples&#xD;
             of live vaccines include intranasal influenza, measles, mumps, rubella, oral polio,&#xD;
             BCG, yellow fever, varicella and TY21a typhoid vaccines.&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. . uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;

        of prior HBV/HCV infection.&#xD;

             uncontrolled nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, malabsorption syndrome or small bowel&#xD;
             resection)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an active, bleeding diathesis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior treatment with an mTOR inhibitor (sirolimus,&#xD;
             temsirolimus, everolimus).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a known hypersensitivity to everolimus (RAD001) or other rapamycins&#xD;
