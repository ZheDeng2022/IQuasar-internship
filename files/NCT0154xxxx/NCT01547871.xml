      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA 1) causes severe muscle weakness and problems with&#xD;
      eating and breathing. The symptoms begin in infancy, and children affected with SMA 1 often&#xD;
      die in early childhood. Researchers want to collect information on how SMA symptoms progress&#xD;
      in first two years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study how the symptoms of SMA 1 progress in infants and children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Infants and children with SMA 1 born on or after January 1, 2007.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers will review the child s medical records and talk with parents by telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For children who are under 2 years of age, the researchers will review the child s&#xD;
           medical records and speak with you on telephone every 2-4 months. Phone calls with&#xD;
           parents will take about 10 minutes and will involve questions about symptoms of SMA 1.&#xD;
           Children will be followed until age 2.- Researchers are also interested in looking at&#xD;
           medical records of children who are no longer alive or who are more than 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents or children do not have to come to the NIH. They will provide consent to view these&#xD;
      records, and information over the telephone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - No treatment or care will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct a pilot, observational, retrospective and prospective, natural history study of&#xD;
      infants affected with spinal muscular atrophy type 1 (SMA 1). The goal is to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of the study design in order to plan a larger study aimed at understanding the&#xD;
      changing natural history and obtain current data on survival of patients affected with SMA 1.&#xD;
      This information is important for designing clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 50 children born on or after January 1, 2007 with a clinical diagnosis of SMA 1 and&#xD;
      genetic testing consistent with a homozygous mutation of the SMN 1 gene on chromosome 5q13&#xD;
      will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a longitudinal pilot study to demonstrate study design feasibility and test outcome&#xD;
      measures to assess the natural history of infants affected with SMA 1. Pertinent clinical and&#xD;
      demographic data will be collected. The data collection will be retrospective for deceased&#xD;
      infants and children who are alive but over age of 2 years at the time of enrollment. A&#xD;
      combination of retrospective and prospective data will be collected for infants who are alive&#xD;
      and less than 2 years of age at the time of enrollment. The data will be collected remotely&#xD;
      from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) by medical chart reviews and/or telephone&#xD;
      questionnaire obtained from the parent of the infant with SMA 1. Infants alive at enrollment&#xD;
      will be followed prospectively until age 2 years or death, whichever occurs first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this pilot study is to demonstrate the feasibility of the study design&#xD;
      and outcome measures in patients with SMA 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include evaluation for time of events, i.e., time of ventilator support&#xD;
      for &gt;=16 hours a day continuously for more than 2 weeks and time of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional demographic and clinical data pertinent to respiratory and nutritional aspects&#xD;
      will be collected to assess possible factors influencing the outcome measures.&#xD;
