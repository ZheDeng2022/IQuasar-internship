    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the procedural safety and effectiveness of the&#xD;
      Phoenix Atherectomy™ System for the treatment of de novo and restenotic atherosclerotic&#xD;
      lesions located in the native peripheral arteries. The Phoenix Atherectomy™ System is&#xD;
      intended for use in atherectomy of the peripheral vasculature. The intended peripheral&#xD;
      vessels include the Superficial Femoral, Popliteal, and Infrapopliteal arteries. The system&#xD;
      is not intended for use in the coronary, carotid, iliac or renal vasculature. The results of&#xD;
      this study will be used to support a 510(k) submission to the Food and Drug Administration.&#xD;
