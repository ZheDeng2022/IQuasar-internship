      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Some people with sickle cell disease have different health problems than others. This may&#xD;
      be related to how easily and frequently the red blood cells break apart in the blood.&#xD;
      Researchers want to test breath and blood samples from people with sickle cell disease to&#xD;
      look for very small amounts of carbon monoxide, which is produced when red blood cells break&#xD;
      apart. They will compare these results with breath samples from healthy volunteers. Studying&#xD;
      different levels of carbon monoxide may help predict what health problems a person with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease may get. It may also provide more information on possible treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study breath carbon monoxide levels and their possible relation to the severity of&#xD;
      sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals at least 18 years of age with sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers who are matched for age, sex, and race with the sickle cell disease&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with sickle cell disease will provide a blood sample and have a heart&#xD;
           function test. They will also breathe into a bag to provide an exhaled breath sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will provide an exhaled breath sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No treatment or care will be provided as part of this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is an autosomal recessive disorder and the most common genetic disease&#xD;
      affecting African-Americans. Approximately 0.15% of African-Americans are homozygous for&#xD;
      sickle cell disease, and 8% have sickle cell trait. Hemoglobin S polymerization leads to red&#xD;
      cell rigidity, microvascular obstruction, inflammation, and end-organ ischemic injury. Our&#xD;
      published data indicate that up to 50% of sickle cell patients have vascular dysfunction due&#xD;
      to impaired bioavailability of endogenous nitric oxide, due in large part to scavenging of&#xD;
      nitric oxide by cell-free hemoglobin. In previous studies we have demonstrated that&#xD;
      steady-state serum LDH is strongly associated with 1) other markers of intravascular&#xD;
      hemolysis including plasma cell-free hemoglobin and arginase levels, 2) levels of soluble&#xD;
      endothelial adhesion molecules, and 3) an impaired vasodilatory response to an NO donor.&#xD;
      Further, significant steady-state LDH elevation identified a subset of patients in our cohort&#xD;
      as well as the CSSCD cohort at increased risk for developing pulmonary hypertension,&#xD;
      cutaneous leg ulceration, priapism, and early death. Previous biochemical studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated significant transient increases in serum LDH and plasma hemoglobin levels during&#xD;
      VOC, and this presumed hyperhemolysis has been confirmed by 51Cr labeled RBC studies that&#xD;
      revealed further decreases in RBC survival during VOC. However, serum LDH levels are not a&#xD;
      specific biomarker of hemolysis, and furthermore these observations on RBC survival have not&#xD;
      been correlated with markers of intravascular hemolysis at baseline in patients with sickle&#xD;
      cell disease in order to confirm the presence of chronic hyperhemolysis subphenotypes in&#xD;
      sickle cell disease as posited in our previous work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current gold standards of random and cohort labeling of RBCs used to quantitate RBC&#xD;
      survival suffer from many technical drawbacks that make them impractical for routine clinical&#xD;
      use. The production rate of expired CO has previously been used to assess RBC survival, based&#xD;
      upon the principal that virtually all CO produced in human beings results from cleavage of&#xD;
      the ?-methene bond of heme and is completely excreted via the lungs. Because RBC destruction&#xD;
      accounts for approximately 80% of heme turnover in the body, endogenous CO production can be&#xD;
      used as a quantitative indicator of RBC life span. Furne et al have previously reported on&#xD;
      the development of a simple, rapid, and noninvasive method for determining RBC life span&#xD;
      based on measurement of exhaled alveolar CO concentration immediately upon awakening&#xD;
      corrected for atmospheric CO, as determined with a device that simulates the body s&#xD;
      equilibration with CO with results comparable to standard labeling techniques. We propose&#xD;
      that this methodology could also provide a quantitative, simple, and noninvasive test to&#xD;
      study the RBC life span and thus rate of hemolysis in those patients with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial will aim to 1) establish the use of end-alveolar CO concentration as a&#xD;
      quantitative measure of RBC life span and hemolytic rate in subjects with sickle cell&#xD;
      disease; 2) investigate the association between end-alveolar CO concentration-derived RBC&#xD;
      life span and laboratory measures of hemolytic severity; and 3) investigate the association&#xD;
      between end-alveolar CO concentration-derived RBC life span and the incidence of various&#xD;
      clinical sequelae of sickle cell disease.&#xD;
