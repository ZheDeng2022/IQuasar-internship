  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the effect of saxagliptin, an anti-diabetes&#xD;
      medication, on hepatic and myocardial fat content and monocyte inflammation in patients with&#xD;
      Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obese, insulin resistant individuals have an excess of fat in the liver which is not&#xD;
      attributable to alcohol or other known causes of liver disease, a condition defined as&#xD;
      nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). The fatty liver is insulin resistant. Individuals&#xD;
      with a fatty liver are more likely to have excess intra-abdominal fat as well as a reduction&#xD;
      in circulating plasma adiponectin levels. A new class of antidiabetes medications known as&#xD;
      dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) inhibitors (sitagliptin, saxagliptin) which enhance the&#xD;
      circulating half life of Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), an incretin hormone that enhances&#xD;
      insulin secretion/ lowers glucose levels, have been approved to treat type 2 diabetes. More&#xD;
      recently, it has been shown that these dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors can also decrease&#xD;
      liver fat and inflammation in animal models of obesity by increasing circulating levels of&#xD;
      GLP-1. It has been shown that GLP-1 enhances liver fat oxidation, reduces liver fat&#xD;
      synthesis, and increases adiponectin levels in animal models in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent reports suggest that NAFLD is associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease independent of associated cardiovascular risk factors. Furthermore type 2 diabetics&#xD;
      and subjects with impaired glucose tolerance are characterized by an increase in both hepatic&#xD;
      and myocardial fat and left ventricular (LV) dysfunction, particularly diastolic dysfunction.&#xD;
      Myocardial steatosis is an independent predictor of diastolic dysfunction in type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus as well as impaired glucose tolerance. However, the effect of saxagliptin therapy on&#xD;
      liver and myocardial fat content, as well as LV systolic and diastolic function in patients&#xD;
      with impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) or type 2 diabetes has not been previously studied.&#xD;
      Recently, it has been demonstrated that myocardial triglyceride content is increased in type&#xD;
      2 diabetic patients and is associated with impaired left ventricular diastolic function,&#xD;
      independently of age, body mass index (BMI), heart rate, visceral fat, and diastolic blood&#xD;
      pressure. More recently, it has been shown that that obese normal glucose tolerant subjects,&#xD;
      obese subjects with IGT, and type 2 diabetic subjects have increased myocardial fat compared&#xD;
      to lean subjects. Thus, both IGT and type 2 diabetic subjects have increased myocardial&#xD;
      steatosis and defects in LV function. GLP-1 has been shown to improve myocardial function and&#xD;
      cardiac output in conscious chronically instrumented canine models of cardiac injury or heart&#xD;
      failure. GLP-1 increased cardiac output and reduced left ventricular end diastolic pressure&#xD;
      in association with reduced systemic vascular resistance, and it improved myocardial insulin&#xD;
      sensitivity and myocardial glucose uptake in dogs with rapid pacing-induced dilated&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy. However, no previous study has examined the effect of saxagliptin on&#xD;
      myocardial fat or LV function in IGT or type 2 diabetic patients. Finally, the effect of&#xD;
      saxagliptin on vascular inflammation and monocyte Nuclear Factor-KappaB (NFkappaB) remains to&#xD;
      be studied. Patients with Impaired Glucose Tolerance (IGT)/ Impaired Fasting Glucose (IFG)&#xD;
      have insulin resistance as a well established defect. Furthermore, as stated previously, both&#xD;
      myocardial and hepatic steatosis as well as defects in LV function are well characterized in&#xD;
      obese, insulin resistant patients with IGT. However, the effect of DPP IV inhibitors on&#xD;
      hepatic and myocardial steatosis and monocyte inflammation in insulin resistant patients with&#xD;
      IGT have not been previously studied.&#xD;
