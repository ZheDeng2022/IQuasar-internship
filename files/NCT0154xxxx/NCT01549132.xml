      The investigators believe that oxygen saturation measurements in the retina may provide more&#xD;
      information on how well the retina is working and may detect problems in the retina earlier&#xD;
      than the fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA). This may be useful to an ophthalmologist so&#xD;
      that they may identify abnormal areas of the retina and commence or change the treatment so&#xD;
      that they may prevent irreversible blindness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients with clinically significant macular oedema and/or ischaemic diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy could have either laser or Intravitreal Anti-VEGF injection treatment provided&#xD;
      they are counseled about the risks. It is known the Anti-VEGF injections reduce oedema and it&#xD;
      is believed that laser treatment of the retina in this condition improves the oxygen supply&#xD;
      to the retina and sometimes reverses the damage. It will be useful to take pictures of these&#xD;
      treated eyes using the Oxymap spectral retinal camera(s) to see whether the investigators can&#xD;
      detect a change in the oxygen saturation in the retina before and after treatment using our&#xD;
      oxygen saturation methods.&#xD;

      WHAT IS SPECTRAL IMAGING?&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a way of studying in detail an area that is being imaged. This can be done because&#xD;
      each picture of the same area is taken using different colours of light (wavelength).&#xD;
      Different materials in the picture will absorb and reflect the different wavelengths of light&#xD;
      from a hyperspectral camera differently. It is then possible to look at each point in the&#xD;
      picture and work out what is in the picture. This has been used in satellites and aeroplanes&#xD;
      to identify what is on the ground. For example, it can distinguish the different types of&#xD;
      trees on the ground based on the different way they absorb and reflect different wavelengths&#xD;
      of light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      USING SPECTRAL IMAGING IN MEDICINE. Spectral imaging was found to have uses in medicine&#xD;
      because of its ability to distinguish one thing from another. A lot of Spectral imaging&#xD;
      research has been done to measure the amount of oxygen in the blood. This is because oxygen&#xD;
      is important to all living cells in the human body - without it cells would die or stop&#xD;
      working. Oxygen is carried to living cells by blood in blood vessels known as arteries and&#xD;
      the left over is carried away by veins. Most of the oxygen in the blood is transported by&#xD;
      cells in the blood containing a chemical called haemoglobin. There are two main forms of&#xD;
      haemoglobin called oxyhaemoglobin (haemoglobin binds to oxygen) and deoxyhaemoglobin&#xD;
      (haemoglobin that is not bound to oxygen). The proportion of oxyhaemoglobin to the total&#xD;
      amount of haemoglobin (both oxyhaemoglobin and deoxyhaemoglobin) is called the oxygen&#xD;
      saturation and is presented as a percentage. The normal saturation in the artery is about 97%&#xD;
      because it contains more oxyhaemoglobin and in the vein it is about 75% because it contains&#xD;
      less oxyhaemoglobin. Importantly oxyhaemoglobin (HbO2) and deoxyhaemoglobin (Hb) have&#xD;
      different spectral characteristics - i.e they absorb light differently at various wavelengths&#xD;
      of light. This has been extensively documented in various publications using samples of&#xD;
      blood. This property is the basis of pulse oximetry which is the measurement of the oxygen&#xD;
      saturation (OS) in the finger tip using a saturation probe which is commonly used in the&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The different spectral characteristics of Hb and HbO2 can also be used in spectral imaging to&#xD;
      calculate the amount of each in the blood to perform oxygen saturation measurements in&#xD;
      certain parts of the body. This has previously been used to study the oxygen supply in the&#xD;
      skin and also to look at the oxygen supply in patients with diabetes which is a condition&#xD;
      that is caused by a lack of a hormone called insulin causing high amount of sugar in the&#xD;
      blood resulting in damage to the blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spectral imaging has only recently started to be used in imaging the eye. The main emphasis&#xD;
      of Spectral imaging in ophthalmology has been on measuring the oxygen saturations in the&#xD;
      retina (the layer at the back of the eye that allows us to see). This is called retinal&#xD;
      oximetry. In essence, the principles of retinal oximetry are similar to that of pulse&#xD;
      oximetry, i.e using the different spectral characteristics of Hb and HbO2 to calculate the&#xD;
      oxygen saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In diabetic retinopathy, the only way the investigators can study the blood supply is by&#xD;
      performing a Fundus Fluorescein Angiogram (FFA). This is an invasive test which involves the&#xD;
      injection of a dye into the arm, this dye is transported by blood to the eye and pictures of&#xD;
      the blood vessels are taken with the dye in it. Also, importantly, there are side effects&#xD;
      (sometimes life-threatening) to injecting this dye into the arm. If there is a problem with&#xD;
      the blood supply in the retina then the dye will not fill up in the blood vessel and is seen&#xD;
      in the pictures as a black area. The FFA provides information on the blood supply but not&#xD;
      directly on the amount of oxygen in it. Loss of sight from diabetic retinopathy and&#xD;
      age-related macular degeneration is believed to be caused by a reduction in the amount oxygen&#xD;
      being supplied to the retina by the blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that oxygen saturation measurements in the retina using spectral&#xD;
      imaging could be a more useful test for an ophthalmologist because it may provide more&#xD;
      information on how well the retina is working and may detect problems in the retina earlier&#xD;
      than the FFA. This may be useful to an ophthalmologist so that they may identify abnormal&#xD;
      areas of the retina and commence or change the treatment so that they may prevent&#xD;
      irreversible blindness.&#xD;
