    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate whether administration of a CYP1A2&#xD;
      inhibitor affects the single-dose pharmacokinetics of tasimelteon and its metabolites. The&#xD;
      safety and tolerability of tasimelteon will also be assessed throughout the study.&#xD;
