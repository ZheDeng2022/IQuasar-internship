    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate improved vein graft patency rates at 12 months&#xD;
      for endoscopically harvested saphenous vein grafts. The study will evaluate use modifications&#xD;
      to existing techniques in vein graft handling during harvests. A secondary aim is to develop&#xD;
      a standardized approach for harvesting, handling, and preparing vein grafts in the endoscopic&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Available data supports two facts: 1) Saphenous vein graft failure rates may be as high as&#xD;
      47% per patient at one year post coronary artery bypass grafting, and 2) Endoscopic&#xD;
      vein-graft harvesting is independently associated with vein-graft failure and adverse&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple factors may contribute to the lower long term patency rates of endoscopically&#xD;
      harvested grafts. Summarized, the two major contributing factors are theorized to be&#xD;
      harvesting techniques and vein trauma during harvesting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With recognized disadvantages of open vessel harvesting including higher incidence of&#xD;
      infection, longer incisions, greater potential for poor healing, and longer length of&#xD;
      hospital stay, reducing the failure rate of vein grafts harvested endoscopically is of utmost&#xD;
      importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is our hypothesis that modification of existing harvesting techniques can improve vein&#xD;
      graft patency in endoscopic vein graft harvesting so that patency rates comparable to open&#xD;
      vessel harvesting can be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this prospective, multi-center non-randomized, observational study, 100 patients will&#xD;
      undergo routine coronary artery bypass grafting. Eligible candidates will undergo lone&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures with endoscopic vein graft harvesting using&#xD;
      best harvesting practices. As a part of routine postoperative care, patients will be&#xD;
      prescribed dual-antiplatelet therapy of aspirin and clopidogrel. Compliance with 3 months of&#xD;
      dual-antiplatelet therapy will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vein graft patency will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intra-operatively by transit time graft flow measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Post-operative Day 30 through Cardiac CT Angiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Post-operative Month 12 through Cardiac CT Angiography.&#xD;
