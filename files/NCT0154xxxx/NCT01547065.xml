      The investigators hypothesize that transesophageal echocardiography is a valid method to&#xD;
      obtain renal doppler hemodynamics2, 4. The goal of this study is to determine if there is a&#xD;
      correlation between abnormal TEE resistive index measurements, intraoperative events and&#xD;
      post-operative creatinine changes&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The significant morbidity and mortality associated with acute kidney injury in critical care&#xD;
      patients and after cardiac surgery is well-known. Studies have demonstrated between 1 to 30%&#xD;
      postoperative mortality and even higher rates of up to 70% when patients develop renal&#xD;
      failure and require dialysis. Even small increases in creatinine between 0 to 0.5 mg/dl can&#xD;
      result in a greater than two-fold rise in 30-day mortality.1 Despite efforts to improve&#xD;
      outcome, there has been no proven effective pharmacological interventions to treat acute&#xD;
      kidney failure. Most recommendations are aimed at prevention by identifying high-risk&#xD;
      patients, avoiding nephrotoxic drugs and minimizing intraoperative hypotensive insults.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are few studies that have examined the maintenance of adequate renal perfusion by&#xD;
      measuring renal blood flow using transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) during&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass.3, 4 Yang et al. examined the left renal artery of 60 patients using&#xD;
      TEE during cardiac surgery and evaluated the feasibility of using TEE as a method to measure&#xD;
      renal blood flow intraoperatively.4 Although they were only able to include 60% of the&#xD;
      subjects due to technical difficulties, they did demonstrate less than 10% variability&#xD;
      between measurements and therefore good reproducibility using TEE. However, renal blood flow&#xD;
      may not be the best method to predict sufficient renal perfusion. Renal autoregulation is not&#xD;
      preserved under general anesthesia even with the maintenance of adequate mean arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure and cardiac output. Renal blood flow is further worsened by hemodilution and&#xD;
      hypothermia. In addition, due to its pulsatile nature, the diameters of the renal arteries&#xD;
      vary during the cardiac cycle and are a source of calculation error when determining renal&#xD;
      blood flow as a function of renal blood velocity and arterial diameter.2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Renal resistive index (RI) is a measure of intrarenal hemodynamics that is calculated using&#xD;
      the blood flow velocities of segmental or intrarenal vessels and correlates with renal blood&#xD;
      flow and renovascular resistance. The renal artery is not used because the flow varies and is&#xD;
      inconsistent between systole and diastole. RI becomes elevated in pathological conditions and&#xD;
      is associated with increasing creatinine, renal injury and dysfunction.5-7 As blood flow and&#xD;
      creatinine clearance decrease through the renal vasculature, the resistive index increases.&#xD;
      Resistive index may be a better gauge of renal dysfunction rather than renal blood flow&#xD;
      because it is easier to assess and less dependent on obtaining a Doppler beam view that is&#xD;
      oriented perfectly parallel to the blood flow.2 Because RI is a ratio of the renal blood flow&#xD;
      velocities [RI = (peak systolic velocity - peak end diastolic velocity)/peak systolic&#xD;
      velocity], the margin of error created by non-parallel Doppler beams cancels out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, resistive index is obtained by transabdominal Doppler ultrasonography (USG)&#xD;
      although there have been transesophageal studies that have used RI as a secondary endpoint&#xD;
      when examining renal blood flow.2, 4 There is currently no technique that routinely uses TEE&#xD;
      to intraoperatively monitor resistive index as a determination of adequate renal blood&#xD;
      perfusion and an indication of renal compromise.8 In addition, while other studies have&#xD;
      reported RI as a secondary outcome, no studies have validated the TEE calculation of&#xD;
      resistive index compared to the established transabdominal doppler technique.&#xD;
