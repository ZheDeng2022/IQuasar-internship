  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of tailored lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention in primary care by comparing changes in the primary measure of weight and body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) and secondarily: physical activity (PA), fat calories consumed, and&#xD;
      fruit/vegetable servings within the two arms (intervention and control) of the study. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that the intervention cohort will demonstrate greater reductions in body weight,&#xD;
      body neglect, and fat calories consumed and greater increases in physical activity and&#xD;
      fruits/vegetable servings after two years compared to the control cohort. The study also aims&#xD;
      to evaluate and compare the cost of intervention for purpose per each unit of measure lost&#xD;
      between the two arms of the study as a secondary objective. The cost of intervention will be&#xD;
      evaluated as it relates to study replication.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will translate and evaluate previously successful weight loss and physical activity&#xD;
      studies into a primary care setting in terms of efficacy and cost effectiveness. Patients are&#xD;
      recruited by their primary care physicians office and screened for participation and&#xD;
      contraindications by phone. A screening visit with a run-in period of food and exercise log&#xD;
      adherence is performed. All participants have meetings with a Lifestyle Counselor to set&#xD;
      nutritional and lifestyle goals and an introduction to weight loss techniques at baseline, 6&#xD;
      months, and 12 months. A structured eating plan will be given at the baseline visit.&#xD;
      Participants at the baseline visit are randomized to either the intervention and control&#xD;
      groups. During the first year, intervention participants will receive monthly motivational&#xD;
      phone calls from their lifestyle counselor to assess their progress and help navigate the&#xD;
      lifestyle changes. Food and exercise logs are reviewed frequently and written feedback give&#xD;
      to each interventional participant. Intervention participants also receive weekly mailings&#xD;
      focusing on weight loss, physical activity and healthy eating, and four tailored mailings&#xD;
      based upon information gained through contact with the lifestyle counselor. Intervention&#xD;
      participants will also receive 2 informative DVDs during the first year. Control participants&#xD;
      receive 2 NIDDK informational handouts on weight loss. For the second year of the study&#xD;
      focuses on maintenance. Intervention participants receive reduced mailings of 2 per month for&#xD;
      6 months and then once a month until the end of one year. Intervention participants receive&#xD;
      one additional motivational phone call at 13 months if they have not reached their weight&#xD;
      loss goal and also receive 2 more informative DVDs. The control participants will receive 3&#xD;
      informational NIDDK mailings. The two arms of the study will be compared using the critical&#xD;
      outcome measures (weight loss, PA, fat calories &amp; vegetable/fruit servings consumed) and&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures (waist and hip circumference,BP,Heart rate) for weight loss&#xD;
      efficacy. We will also evaluate the cost-effectiveness for dissemination as a PCP weight loss&#xD;
      program in addition to the overall cost-effectiveness for the participant in terms of money&#xD;
      spent and adverse events related to the lifestyle change.&#xD;
