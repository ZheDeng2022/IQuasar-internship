      The purpose of the study is to assess whether, in individuals with rheumatoid arthritis, a&#xD;
      low-fat, vegan diet improves pain and other subjective symptoms more effectively than a&#xD;
      control supplement or a placebo. The principal measure is pain as measured by Visual Analog&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) and disease activity as measured by number of painful swollen and tender joints,&#xD;
      respectively. The study duration is 36 weeks.&#xD;

      Preliminary evidence suggests that low-fat, vegetarian diets and certain nutritional&#xD;
      supplements can help reduce pain and also reduce the need for pain medications for some&#xD;
      people. The investigators will ask about 100 people to participate. All of them will get a&#xD;
      low-fat, vegan diet and a nutritional supplement (mixture of omega-3 oils and vitamin E or a&#xD;
      placebo), although some will get the diet first, and others will get the supplement first.&#xD;
      This order in which they will get the diet and the supplement will be determined randomly,&#xD;
      that is, by chance (like the toss of a coin). The principal measure is pain as measured by&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale (VAS) and disease activity as measured by number of painful swollen and&#xD;
      tender joints, respectively. The study duration is 36 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis, as defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A diagnosis of rheumatoid arthritis is based on 2010 ACR / EULAR Rheumatoid Arthritis&#xD;
             Classification Criteria. Classification as &quot;definite RA&quot; is based on the confirmed&#xD;
             presence of synovitis in at least 1 joint, absence of an alternative diagnosis that&#xD;
             better explains the synovitis, and achievement of a total score of 6 or greater (of a&#xD;
             possible 10): 24&#xD;
&#xD;
             Joint involvement, designating the metacarpophalangeal joints, proximal&#xD;
             interphalangeal joints, the interphalangeal joint of the thumb, second through third&#xD;
             metatarsophalangeal joint and wrist as small joints, and elbows, hip joints and knees&#xD;
             as large joints:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Involvement of 1 large joint gives 0 points&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Involvement of 2-10 large joints gives 1 point&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Involvement of 1-3 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)&#xD;
                  gives 2 points&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Involvement of4-10 small joints (with or without involvement of large joints)&#xD;
                  gives 3 points&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Involvement of more than 10 joints (with involvement of at least 1 small joint)&#xD;
                  gives 5 points&#xD;
&#xD;
             Serological parameters - including the rheumatoid factor as well as anti-citrullinated&#xD;
             protein antibody (ACPA):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Negative RF and negative ACPA gives 0 points&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Low-positive RF or low-positive ACPA gives 2 points&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  High-positive RF or high-positive ACPA gives 3 points Acute phase reactants: 1&#xD;
                  point for elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) or elevated C-reactive&#xD;
                  protein (CRP) value Duration of arthritis: 1 point for symptoms lasting six weeks&#xD;
                  or longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Continuing or recurring pain (i.e., joint pain daily, unless on pain medication).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Age at least 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability and willingness to participate in all components of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Willingness to be assigned to either the diet group or supplement group&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Pain medications unchanged within last 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Rheumatoid arthritis for more than 6 years&#xD;
&#xD;

             increased drinking (e.g., more than 2 drinks per day on weekends), or a history of&#xD;
             alcohol abuse or dependency followed by any current use&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Use of recreational drugs in the past 6 months (past drug use, if fully recovered, is&#xD;
             not a criteria for exclusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Unstable medical or psychiatric illness&#xD;
