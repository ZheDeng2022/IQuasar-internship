  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The PeerScope System consists of Peer Medical camera heads, endoscopes, video system, light&#xD;
      source and other ancillary equipment. The system is intended for endoscopic diagnosis,&#xD;
      treatment and video observation of the digestive tract. The PeerScope system model B is&#xD;
      indicated for use for endoscopy and endoscopic treatment within the lower digestive tract&#xD;
      (including the anus, rectum, sigmoid colon, colon and ileocecal valve) of adults patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:To compare the additional diagnostic yield obtained by using the PeerScope System™&#xD;
      extended view vs. the diagnostic yield obtained by the Standard view colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, time measurements including time to cecum, time for withdrawal and overall&#xD;
      procedure time will be analyzed and reported for each group.&#xD;

      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are scheduled for screening, surveillance or diagnostic colonoscopy will be&#xD;
      recruited to the study and randomized to one of two groups. Each enrolled subject will&#xD;
      undergo two &quot;back-to-back&quot; procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Group A (study group) will undergo a Standard view colonoscopy followed&#xD;
      immediately by a PeerScope System™ extended view colonoscopy. Subjects in Group B (control&#xD;
      group) will undergo a PeerScope System™ extended view colonoscopy followed immediately by a&#xD;
      Standard view colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from the two groups will be analyzed and compared, with primary outcome measures&#xD;
      being detection rates for total polyps and detection rates for adenomas. Secondary outcome&#xD;
      measures will include withdrawal time, total procedure time and characteristics of polyps&#xD;
      detected, including size and histological results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed through a 24 hour and a 7 days telephone interview for analysis of&#xD;
      unexpected adverse events. Clinical results will be analyzed using various statistical&#xD;
      measures of significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multi-center study with up to 196 patients. No. of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 196 treated patients will be enrolled into the study. Primary Performance Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard view colonoscopy adenoma overall detection rate compared to the extended view&#xD;
           overall adenoma detection rate using the PeerScope System™&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard view colonoscopy overall polyp detection rate compared to the extended view&#xD;
           overall polyp detection rate using the PeerScope System™.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of device-related and procedure-related serious adverse events. Incidence of&#xD;
      complications using PeerScope System™&#xD;
&#xD;
      Known complications include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perforation;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Severe abdominal pain;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infection;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bleeding (other than expected minor bleeding due to therapeutic procedures e.g.&#xD;
           polypectomy);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inducing inflammation of diverticulum&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arrhythmia, bradycardia, hypotension, hypoxia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints / Other Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Performance of therapeutic interventions, such as biopsies, polypectomies, APC etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Procedure time. The following will be recorded: a. Time for intubation to the cecum. b.&#xD;
           Time for withdrawal from the cecum to the anal verge. c. Total procedure time A&#xD;
           stopwatch will be used for stopping the timing of the procedure for any polypectomy&#xD;
           performed and then restarting once the polypectomy is completed, meaning that purely&#xD;
           procedure time is measured&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sedation dosage&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patient satisfaction. Patient's pain at the end of the procedure will be recorded using&#xD;
           VAS scale. Results of 24 hour telephone follow-up to assess for post-procedural patient&#xD;
           satisfactory will be recorded on the CRF.&#xD;

    <description>Sample size calculation is based on detecting a difference in the adenoma overall detection rate and the overall polyp detection rate using the PeerScope System™ extended view as compared to Standard view colonoscopy.&#xD;
Total sample size will be 196 patients. Each patient will undergo the procedure by the two devices: PeerScope System™ extended view and Standard view colonoscopy. The rational for this sample size is based on detecting a rate difference of 20% between the study devices.</description>
