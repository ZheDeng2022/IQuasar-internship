  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate the possibility that use of two similar but distinct&#xD;
      drugs used together in treatment of advanced cancer might prove less toxic than either agent&#xD;
      used alone, because dosages can be reduced for each agent. This is a phase I study that is&#xD;
      designed to measure the frequency and levels of specific side effects when Carboplatin and&#xD;
      Pazopanib are used in combination in advanced cancer patients. The possibility that&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity will occur is also going to be investigated.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pazopanib has shown a promising anti-cancer activity as a single agent tyrosine kinase&#xD;
      inhibitor. Activity against multiple tumors such as renal cell carcinoma (RCC) and&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors have been documented, and it recently gained FDA approval for the&#xD;
      treatment of metastatic kidney cancer. Also, an impressive activity as a single agent was&#xD;
      recently reported in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) in the neoadjuvant setting, where&#xD;
      tumor shrinkage occurred in 86% of patients. Encouraging activity has also been seen in&#xD;
      cervical cancer, ovarian cancer and soft tissue sarcomas. Multi-kinase targeting is an&#xD;
      approach that may prove beneficial in a number of patient populations. In particular cancers&#xD;
      such as breast, colon, pancreas etc., patients represent heterogeneous population of small&#xD;
      groups based on genetic analyses. Some of these populations may benefit when multiple agents&#xD;
      are given which have similar, but distinct targets of action. Dosages and therefore&#xD;
      associated toxicities might be reduced by such an approach.&#xD;

    <description>Patients will receive 200mg of Pazopanib, with later subjects receiving higher dosages up to 800mg of Pazopanib. If a given dose level is not well tolerated when given on all days (1-21) of each cycle, the study will no longer use that dosage. Later subjects may take Pazopanib from days 3-19 of the three week cycle to see if that dosing schedule is better tolerated.&#xD;
If patients experience side effects from Pazopanib or tests indicate some undesirable effects, then the dose level of Pazopanib that they are receiving may need to be adjusted, with increased monitoring.</description>
