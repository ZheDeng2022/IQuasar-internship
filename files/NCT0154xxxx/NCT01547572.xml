  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Since the introduction and favourable early results of enhanced recovery programmes more than&#xD;
      a decade ago, such programmes have become increasingly popular following major surgery. Many&#xD;
      elements of these programmes are based on solid evidence and derived from published trials.&#xD;
      These programmes optimize different factors to reduce the stress of surgery with the aim of&#xD;
      improving patient outcome and speed up recovery after surgery. Key factors prior to surgery&#xD;
      are conditioning of expectations and optimizing associated disease. Strategies during the&#xD;
      operation include use of short-acting anaesthetic (sleeping) agents, maintenance of normal&#xD;
      temperatures and minimal access surgery (keyhole surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care after surgery is optimized with appropriate analgesia (pain killers), early mobilisation&#xD;
      (walking) and early feeding. This combined approach reduces hospital stay to 2-4 days. There&#xD;
      is also evidence that the improvements resulting from the implementation of an enhanced&#xD;
      recovery programme do not cause significant deterioration in quality of life or transfer&#xD;
      costs to another component of health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relative contribution of each of the single elements in the enhanced recovery programme&#xD;
      remains uncertain. Good patient information gives confidence and improves overall outcome. No&#xD;
      studies have examined the impact of video education on recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to explore the use of video information provision for patients&#xD;
      participating in an enhanced recovery programme.&#xD;

      TRIAL DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomised controlled trial of the impact of video education in preparing patients for&#xD;
      surgery within an enhanced recovery programme. Patients will be recruited from Leicester&#xD;
      General Hospital and will include everyone undergoing colorectal(bowel) surgery. A standard&#xD;
      protocol (treatment regime) is in place for all such patients. The primary end-point (main&#xD;
      aim) will be length of hospital stay. Secondary end-points (other factors to be considered)&#xD;
      will be patient satisfaction scores (using SF-36 outcomes in patients) and will allow the&#xD;
      investigation of the potential implications of incorporating video education of enhanced&#xD;
      recovery programmes into routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeons treating the patients in this trial will have a specialist interest in&#xD;
      colorectal (bowel) surgery. All patients undergoing planned bowel surgery for benign&#xD;
      (non-cancerous) and malignant (cancerous) disease will be eligible. Patients who cannot speak&#xD;
      or understand english will have interpreters. Ethics approval will be sought and informed&#xD;
      (signed) consent both for the surgery and the trial will be obtained. The study group will&#xD;
      get a video and leaflet and the control group will receive a leaflet only. Randomisation&#xD;
      (Division into groups) will be done using a table of random numbers to assign each study&#xD;
      participant to a group. The consultants and registrars in charge of taking care of patients&#xD;
      after their surgery will not be aware of which group patients belong to and a standard&#xD;
      discharge criteria will be used (Patients for discharge should have normal observations and&#xD;
      normal bloods results, free from lines in the hands and tubes in the waterworks, be fully&#xD;
      mobile (walking), able to get in and out of bed unaided and dress independently. Hospital&#xD;
      stay will be recorded in days from the time the patient is admitted to hospital. Social&#xD;
      reasons for non-discharge such as delay in setting up home help etc will be recorded for both&#xD;
      groups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to passage of flatus (wind from the back passage) and bowel motion (stool) will be&#xD;
      recorded for each patient. Episodes of nausea and vomiting (sickness) will also be recorded&#xD;
      as will any complication up to 30 days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will complete a questionnaire (SF-36) prior to surgery and at 3 months after&#xD;
      surgery to assess satisfaction and return to normal activities such as leisure activities and&#xD;
      work in the home etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DETAILS OF THE ENHANCED RECOVERY PROGRAMME:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative preparation (Prior to surgery) All patients will be allowed free fluids&#xD;
      (liquids) and high calorie (energy) drinks for up to 2 hours before operation. Patients&#xD;
      undergoing right hemicolectomy (right sided bowel surgery) will not receive bowel preparation&#xD;
      (bowel cleansing) while those having left sided surgery will receive phosphate enema on the&#xD;
      morning of surgery. All patients will receive antibiotic and DVT (blood clot) prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have baseline blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaesthesia (During surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardised anaesthetic (sleeping) protocol (treatment regime) will be used for all&#xD;
      patients. Normal temperature will be maintained throughout surgery and all operations will be&#xD;
      carried out through the smallest incision (cut) necessary to complete the procedure. No&#xD;
      nasogastric tubes (stomach tubes) will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative pain and analgesia (Pain relief after surgery) Analgesia(Pain relief) will be&#xD;
      provided in both groups for 48 hours via PCA (patient controlled pain relief), epidural (pain&#xD;
      relief via injection at the back) or TAPP block (pain relief via injection on the belly).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol will be administered concurrently with NSAIDS (non steroidal drugs) and tramadol&#xD;
      for breakthrough pain once morphine is discontinued. Visual analogue (facial expression) pain&#xD;
      scores at rest and movement will be measured daily until discharge. All analgesia (pain&#xD;
      relieving drugs) used after surgery will be recorded including any discharge medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet and Fluids:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral fluids will be pushed immediately postoperatively (after surgery) in both groups. In&#xD;
      addition, protein drinks and normal food will be encouraged in both groups from day 1. All&#xD;
      lines in the arm will be removed by day 2 unless there is a clinical reason to maintain them.&#xD;
      Both groups will have daily blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have chest physiotherapy (exercises) and will be encouraged to mobilise&#xD;
      (walk) on day one with the help of a nurse or physiotherapist.&#xD;
