      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Early-onset Parkinson's disease (EOPD) is more likely to be caused by gene mutations than&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease that develops in older people. Studying these mutations may help find&#xD;
      therapies for EOPD. Researchers want to study mutations on a gene called PARK2. These&#xD;
      mutations prevent fat uptake into cells and may interfere with normal brain function.&#xD;
      Researchers want to study fat and cholesterol in the body to look at the effects of these&#xD;
      mutations on the body and brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To study connections between genetic mutations and EOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 80 years of age with EOPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individuals between 18 and 80 years of age with no family history of Parkinson s&#xD;
           disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be screened with a physical exam and medical history. Blood and urine&#xD;
           samples will also be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have some or all of the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples and tissue (skin and fat) biopsies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cell line development from these tissue samples to study the function of PARK2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DEXA scan to measure body fat context using low dose x-rays&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Glucose and insulin tolerance testing to measure blood sugar levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment will not be provided as part of this protocol.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The majority of subjects with the degenerative Parkinson s Disease present at around the age&#xD;
      of 70 years. Other subjects develop this brain disease before the age of 40 years. This early&#xD;
      onset presentation is more likely to have a direct genetic cause than the degenerative form&#xD;
      of the disease. Our understanding of the genetic causes of early onset Parkinson s Disease&#xD;
      may help us find therapies for both the genetic and more degenerative illnesses. Our&#xD;
      laboratory has found that one of the genetic mutations associated with early onset Parkinson&#xD;
      s Disease, in a gene called PARK2 results in impaired uptake of fat into cells. This may have&#xD;
      detrimental effects in the brain, as the brain requires fat to make cholesterol and to send&#xD;
      brain signals. A finding in mice lacking PARK2, is that they are resistant to diet induced&#xD;
      diabetes and obesity and to fatty liver. These data suggests that the systemic and brain&#xD;
      effects of low fat uptake may be opposing, with low fat uptake having a beneficial effect&#xD;
      against risk factors such as obesity and diabetes but increasing the risk for brain diseases.&#xD;
      To begin to test whether this is the case in subjects with PARK2 mutations we propose to test&#xD;
      their fat uptake and glucose and insulin sensitivity.&#xD;
