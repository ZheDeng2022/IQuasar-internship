      Patients will receive intra-tumoral (IT) NKTR-262 in 3-week treatment cycles. During the&#xD;
      Phase 1 dose escalation portion of the trial, NKTR-262 will be combined with systemic&#xD;
      administration of bempegaldesleukin. After determination of the recommended Phase 2 dose&#xD;
      (RP2D) of NKTR-262, between 6 and 18 patients may be enrolled at the RP2D to further&#xD;
      characterize the safety and tolerability profile of the combination of NKTR 262 plus&#xD;
      bempegaldesleukin (doublet) or NKTR 262 plus bempegaldesleukin in combination with nivolumab&#xD;
      (triplet) in Cohorts A and B, respectively. In the Phase 2 dose expansion portion, patients&#xD;
      will be treated with doublet or triplet in the relapsed/refractory setting and earlier lines&#xD;
      of therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cancer treatments that couple pharmacological activation of tumor antigen presentation with&#xD;
      activation and expansion of CD8+ T and natural killer (NK) cells in the tumor environment&#xD;
      have the potential to induce an effective anti-tumor immune response in patients. NKTR-262 is&#xD;
      a small molecule agonist of toll-like receptors (TLRs) 7/8 designed to be retained in the&#xD;
      tumor micro-environment in order to activate antigen-presenting cells (APC), such as&#xD;
      dendritic cells, to create new antigen-specific cytotoxic T cells. As a CD122-biased agonist,&#xD;
      bempegaldesleukin monotherapy increases newly proliferative CD8+ T cells in tumors. NKTR-262&#xD;
      plus bempegaldesleukin is expected to increase expansion of antigen-specific CD8+ T cells. In&#xD;
      preclinical studies, a single IT injection of NKTR-262 plus IV bempegaldesleukin resulted in&#xD;
      complete abscopal effects in tumor models. Preliminary clinical data show bempegaldesleukin&#xD;
      plus nivolumab enhances immune-stimulatory responses. The REVEAL trial will assess safety and&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of NKTR-262 with bempegaldesleukin +/- nivolumab for the treatment of&#xD;
      selected cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Melanoma (1st-line and relapsed/refractory)&#xD;

        -  Merkel Cell Carcinoma (2nd-line and relapsed/refractory)&#xD;
