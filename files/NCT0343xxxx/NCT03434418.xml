      This is a research study to find out if a drug called, osimertinib, is safe and effective in&#xD;
      treating advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) by targeting the treatment of epidermal&#xD;
      growth factor receptor (EGFR) mutation exon 18 G719X, exon 20 S7681, or exon 21 L861Q.&#xD;
      Patients on the study will not have had previous tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have one of the following EGRF mutations: exon 18 G719X, exon 20 S7681, or exon&#xD;
      21 L861Q) may be eligible to participate in this study. If enrolled into the study, the study&#xD;
      team will give the patient a supply of the study drug, osimbertinib (80 mg) to take at home.&#xD;
      The patient will be asked to take the study drug by mouth on days 1-28 of each study cycle.&#xD;
      As part of this study, the patient will have blood samples other tests, exams and procedures&#xD;
      done for study purposes and their standard of care. Patient participation in the study will&#xD;
      last for up to 2 years after completion of the last dose of the study drug or until your&#xD;
      condition worsens or intolerable adverse events as deemed by the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are possible patient risks to this study that include but are not limited to diarrhea,&#xD;
      changes to the lining of the mouth (e.g. ulcers), rash, dry skin, itching, and nail&#xD;
      infections.&#xD;

             therapy) for their cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
