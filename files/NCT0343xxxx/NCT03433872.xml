      Mathematica Policy Research, funded by OPRE, ACF, DHHS, will conduct a field test of We Grow&#xD;
      Together: The Q-CCIIT Professional Development System. These professional development (PD)&#xD;
      tools and the interactive website featuring the materials were developed to promote&#xD;
      high-quality caregiver-child interactions in non-parental care settings serving infants and&#xD;
      toddlers. This field test aims to: (1) examine changes in caregiver practice that the&#xD;
      investigators expect to be associated with use of the We Grow Together system, and (2)&#xD;
      examine implementation of We Grow Together. As a secondary goal, the investigators will&#xD;
      further evaluate the psychometrics of the Q-CCIIT observational measure of interaction&#xD;
      quality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collecting data from field test participants will occur from fall 2018 through spring 2019.&#xD;
      First, the investigators plan to collect a background survey with caregivers and PD providers&#xD;
      in fall 2018. Second, in fall 2018 and spring 2019 the investigators plan two rounds of&#xD;
      classroom observations using the Q-CCIIT measure and classroom rosters. Third, the&#xD;
      investigators plan to collect data on the use and implementation of We Grow Together through&#xD;
      the interactive website from fall 2018 through spring 2019. Finally, the investigators plan&#xD;
      to conduct a feedback survey with caregivers and PD providers in spring 2019.&#xD;

      The We Grow Together intervention is designed to help caregivers understand how caregiver&#xD;
      interactions with children support the children's development to strengthen high quality&#xD;
      caregiver interactions with infants and toddlers. The starting point for the We Grow Together&#xD;
      process is assessment of a caregiver's interactions with infants and toddlers in early&#xD;
      childhood care and education (ECE) settings, using the Quality of Caregiver-Child&#xD;
      Interactions with Infants and Toddlers (Q-CCIIT) observational measure. Data from the Q CCIIT&#xD;
      observations highlight areas for growth in the caregiver's practices and inform a PD&#xD;
      goal-setting process, with the support of a PD Provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed an array of We Grow Together materials targeting principles&#xD;
      and practices assessed by the Q-CCIIT measure, organized into modules, and delivered on an&#xD;
      interactive website. Over the course of a program year, each caregiver in the study will work&#xD;
      with a PD provider who is trained in guiding caregivers through the use of We Grow Together&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the We Grow Together intervention, all PD providers will receive training in using&#xD;
      We Grow Together to support caregivers' understanding and practices. PD providers' training&#xD;
      will focus on understanding the caregiving principles, relationship skills, adult learning&#xD;
      principles, and coaching strategies that facilitate use of We Grow Together and promote&#xD;
      growth of caregivers' knowledge and skills. PD providers will also have access to a set of PD&#xD;
      provider materials to support implementation of We Grow Together. These materials support the&#xD;
      ongoing relationship-based PD between the PD Provider and caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of information collected under the current request is to examine the&#xD;
      implementation and the outcomes associated with use of We Grow Together. The goals of the&#xD;
      field test will be to: (1) implement We Grow Together for five months in a variety of&#xD;
      settings, (2) collect information on the implementation of We Grow Together, and (3) collect&#xD;
      information on care practices the investigators hypothesize are associated with use of We&#xD;
      Grow Together. The investigators propose the following data collection activities, to be&#xD;
      carried out in fall 2018 through spring 2019:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An ECE setting eligibility screening will determine if a setting is eligible and if&#xD;
           family child care (FCC) and center directors and individual personnel are willing to&#xD;
           participate in the field test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A background survey, completed by all caregivers and PD providers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Observations of caregiver interactions by the investigators using the Q-CCIIT measure,&#xD;
           to assess the quality of care provided by participating caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A classroom information roster, completed by caregivers at the time of the observation,&#xD;
           about the composition and activities within care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Web-user pop-up questions for caregivers and PD providers, collected monthly at website&#xD;
           login.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A feedback survey, completed by caregivers and PD providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A PD provider training survey.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The goal of the field test is to evaluate use of the We Grow Together system by typical early childhood professionals working in a variety of care settings serving infants and toddlers. The field test will take place in 8 to 12 geographic areas across the country. This study will include only centers and FCC settings that already have local PD providers-the investigators will exclude ECE settings without established PD providers. The field test will include a purposive sample of 175 center-based classrooms (approximately half will be affiliated with Early Head Start [EHS], and half will be community-based child care programs). The field test sample will also include 125 FCCs, including those operating under EHS and in community-based settings.</intervention_model_description>
