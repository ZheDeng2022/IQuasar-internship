    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II single-arm open-label study of nivolumab as maintenance therapy after&#xD;
      autologous stem cell transplantation in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma at risk of relapse or&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate safety and tolerability of nivolumab as&#xD;
      maintenance therapy early after autologous stem cell transplant in patients with Hodgkin's&#xD;
      Lymphoma (HL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive nivolumab (240 mg IV) every 2 weeks (± 2 days as long as&#xD;
      interval between doses is 12-16 days) starting 45-120 post-transplant for up to a maximum of&#xD;
      6 months of treatment. Response to treatment will be assessed 6 months and 1 year&#xD;
      post-transplant using Recommendations for Initial Evaluation, Staging, and Response&#xD;
      Assessment of Hodgkin and Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma: The Lugano Classification.&#xD;
