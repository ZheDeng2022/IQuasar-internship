    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia is a common finding in patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS),&#xD;
      and an independent predictor of mortality in patients with and without diabetes. Though&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the cornerstone of ST-segment elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI), the incidence of heart failure, re-infarction and death in&#xD;
      hyperglycemic patients remains significant, with a mortality of more than 40% one year after&#xD;
      the event. In these STEMI patients dual anti-aggregation therapy is currently the gold&#xD;
      standard after PCI, but bleeding phenomena, and therapeutic resistance may reduce their&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy. Therefore, it is likely that the individual response to the dual&#xD;
      anti-aggregation therapy, and the hyperglycemic stress, may influence resistance mechanisms,&#xD;
      and/or lead to an increase in pharmacological functional deactivation by the microbiotic&#xD;
      flora. The term microbiota indicates the totality of the genomes of microorganisms that&#xD;
      reside in an ecological niche, and which constitute the &quot;human microbiota&quot;. In this context,&#xD;
      the analysis of the faecal microbiota before PCI, at hospital discharge and at follow-up,&#xD;
      could be considered useful for identifying hyperglycaemic patients with alteration of&#xD;
      metabolic-oxidative processes, and pro-thrombotic correlates with worse post procedural&#xD;
      prognosis. Therefore, the analysis of faecal microbiota during the STEMI event could&#xD;
      theoretically identify hyperglycemic patients with excessive inflammatory and oxidative tone&#xD;
      caused by hyperglycemia, conditioning resistance to double anti-aggregation therapy and&#xD;
      coronary stenting, and conditioning pro-thrombotic phenomena after coronary reperfusion by&#xD;
      PCI. Therefore, authors will conduct a study to analyze the microbiota in patients with acute&#xD;
      hyperglycaemic and normoglycemic coronary syndrome. The primary objective of this study will&#xD;
      be to evaluate any changes in the microbiota and its activity on faecal material taken before&#xD;
      PCI, and after 6 and 12 months in patients with hyperglycemic STEMI, and also evaluate if the&#xD;
      changes in the microbiota can be related to the 12-month prognosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hyperglycemia is a common finding in patients diagnosed with acute coronary syndrome (ACS)&#xD;
      and is an independent predictor of mortality in patients with and without diabetes (1-4).&#xD;
      Though percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the cornerstone of ST-segment elevation&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (STEMI) (4-6), the incidence of heart failure, re-infarction and death&#xD;
      in hyperglycemic patients remains significant, with a mortality of more than 40% one year&#xD;
      after the event (4-5). In fact, restenosis and no-reflow phenomena are common events leading&#xD;
      to worse clinical outcomes, in hyperglycemic patients undergoing primary PCI, and resulting&#xD;
      in atherothrombotic embolization, increased oxidative stress and inflammation (3-6). In an&#xD;
      attempt to counter the increasing in mortality from hyperglycemia, the coronary units&#xD;
      implemented insulin protocols to normalize blood glucose during ACS, and the same insulin&#xD;
      treatment showed conflicting results (7). Data from small pilot studies, from moderate&#xD;
      clinical trials and a meta-analysis suggested benefits from insulin therapy (1-3.5). On the&#xD;
      other hand, subsequent randomized clinical trials have not confirmed an increase in survival&#xD;
      (7, 8) . Moreover, if the dual anti-aggregation therapy is currently the therapeutic basis of&#xD;
      patients with STEMI treated by PCI (9), increasingly frequent anti-aggregation therapy and&#xD;
      bleeding phenomena, may reduce their therapeutic efficacy (11 -13). Therefore, it is likely&#xD;
      that the individual response to the dual anti-aggregation therapy, and the hyperglycemic&#xD;
      stress, may influence resistance mechanisms, and/or lead to an increase in pharmacological&#xD;
      functional deactivation by the microbiotic flora. The term microbiota indicates the totality&#xD;
      of the genomes of microorganisms that reside in an ecological niche, and which constitute the&#xD;
      &quot;human microbiota&quot; (14). According to the analyzed anatomical district we speak of&#xD;
      intestinal, ocular, buccal, vaginal microbiota, etc. The DNA analysis of microorganisms&#xD;
      living in the human intestinal tract, realized with metagenomic methods by the MetaHIT&#xD;
      consortium, has identified over 3 million genes, 150 times those of the human species&#xD;
      (16-21). In addition, cardiovascular diseases such as hypertension and coronary artery&#xD;
      disease are strongly conditioned by the presence of Enterobacteriaceae, Firmicutes and&#xD;
      Lattobacilli in the intestine, which can determine their onset (22). In this context, the&#xD;
      analysis of the faecal microbiota before PCI, at hospital discharge and at follow-up, could&#xD;
      be considered useful for identifying hyperglycaemic patients with alteration of&#xD;
      metabolic-oxidative processes, and pro-thrombotic correlates with worse post procedural&#xD;
      prognosis ( 23). The ease of obtaining samples of faecal microbiota, and the relevant impact&#xD;
      on the scientific community, and on routine clinical practice, pushes us to insist on&#xD;
      clinical research, together with a genomic, metabolic and cellular analysis of the&#xD;
      microbiota, and to extract as much information as possible in hyperglycemic patients with&#xD;
      STEMI. This investigation has never been proposed in the scientific research and clinical&#xD;
      practice of hospitalized hyperglycaemic patients for STEMI. Indeed, a large amount of&#xD;
      evidence suggests that, hyperglycaemia causes an increasing production of oxidative stress&#xD;
      and inflammation, both in atherosclerotic plaque and in the thrombus, and therefore it plays&#xD;
      a central role in determining worse outcomes in STEMI. Therefore, the analysis of faecal&#xD;
      microbiota during the event could theoretically identify hyperglycemic patients with&#xD;
      excessive inflammatory and oxidative tone caused by hyperglycemia, conditioning resistance to&#xD;
      double anti-aggregation therapy and coronary stenting, and conditioning pro-thrombotic&#xD;
      phenomena after coronary reperfusion by PCI. Therefore, authors will conduct a study to&#xD;
      analyze the microbiota in patients with acute hyperglycaemic and normoglycemic coronary&#xD;
      syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES The primary objective of this study will be to evaluate any changes in the&#xD;
      microbiota and its activity on faecal material taken before PCI, and after 6 and 12 months in&#xD;
      patients with hyperglycemic STEMI, and also evaluate if the changes in the microbiota can be&#xD;
      related to the 12-month prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS Patients This is a cohort study to investigate the effects of possible&#xD;
      changes in the microbiota and its activity in faecal samples taken from patients with&#xD;
      hyperglycemic STEMI v/s normoglycemic. These patients are treated according to routine &quot;real&#xD;
      life&quot; therapeutic practices, adopted at the Cardiology Division of the &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot;&#xD;
      University of Campania. After discharge from the hospital, all patients will be invited to&#xD;
      carry out the control visits, as indicated by the guidelines for the management of post-STEMI&#xD;
      patients (6), at the Cardiology Division of the University of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli &quot;and&#xD;
      at the VI Division of Internal Medicine of the&quot; Luigi Vanvitelli &quot;University of Campania. All&#xD;
      patients will be monitored for 12 months after the event, as a follow-up. According to the&#xD;
      recent definition of the American Heart Association, hyperglycemia will be defined by fasting&#xD;
      blood glycemic levels&gt; 140 mg / dl (1, 9). All patients with onset of symptoms within 12&#xD;
      hours and 1 mm elevation of the ST segment in 2 or more contiguous peripheral leads or at&#xD;
      least 2 mm in 2 or more contiguous precordial leads or new onset left branch block will be&#xD;
      considered for PCI. Inclusion criteria will include: age over 18 and admission for STEMI&#xD;
      first episode. Patients with left ventricular ejection fraction &lt;25%, with previous IMA or&#xD;
      previous PCI and / or by-pass will be excluded. Each will be included in the study after&#xD;
      signing an informed consent. Routine haematological analysis will be performed at the time of&#xD;
      acceptance, before practicing medical therapy and possible coronary artery examination and&#xD;
      after 6 and 12 months. On an aliquot of the blood sample taken at these times, we will&#xD;
      evaluate trimethylamine-N-oxide (TMAO), a product of bacterial metabolism, whose elevated&#xD;
      serum levels are associated with adverse cardiovascular events (24). In addition, before the&#xD;
      PCI, and 6 and 12 months later, a stool sample will be taken on which the microbiota will be&#xD;
      subsequently analyzed. The research will be conducted in accordance with the principles of&#xD;
      the Helsinki declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure In this study authors will evaluate a cohort of patients with STEMI admitted to the&#xD;
      Cardiology Division of the &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot; University of Campania, and treated by dual&#xD;
      anti-aggregating therapy. All patients will be treated according to the suggested protocols&#xD;
      of the latest Guidelines on STEMI (6). Patients will be classified into two groups:&#xD;
      hyperglycaemic patients v/s normoglycemic, in both groups of patients will be carried out&#xD;
      analysis of the fecal microbiota, pre PCI and pre dual antiplatelet therapy. The microbiota&#xD;
      will be extracted from faecal material, and then prepared and subsequently analyzed. It is&#xD;
      not possible in clinical practice to culture in the laboratory the vast majority of&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria, as compared to the enormous amount of microorganisms present. Thanks to&#xD;
      the most up-to-date techniques of sequencing the bacterial DNA (Next Generation Sequencing)&#xD;
      extracted from the faecal material, it is now possible a complete and reliable identification&#xD;
      of the intestinal microbiota. In addition to identify the bacterial species present, authors&#xD;
      are also able to express an overall health degree of the microbiota (or dysbiosis), its&#xD;
      efficiency in the production of some useful or harmful substances, the adequacy of the&#xD;
      microbiota with respect to some fundamental functions to which is a deputy and the propensity&#xD;
      of the microbiota itself against inflammatory bowel diseases, metabolic diseases and aging.&#xD;
      The result is an impressive amount of data, a true identity card of the microbiota, named the&#xD;
      Microbiota passport.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample preparation and analysis. Samples for sequencing the microbiota will be collected from&#xD;
      faecal material and stored at ultra-low temperature (-80°C) to avoid damage to the original&#xD;
      sample. The sequencing of the microbiota will be performed by the laboratory of Microbiology&#xD;
      of the University of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot;. For the sequencing of the microbiota we&#xD;
      will use the &quot;NextGeneration Sequencing&quot; (NGS) method, which allows the sequencing in&#xD;
      parallel of millions of DNA fragments (25) through the use of Illumina machinery (San Diego,&#xD;
      CA). The DNA will be extracted from these samples using a high reproducibility commercial kit&#xD;
      procedure (Qiagen, Invitrogen). The final yield and quality of the extracted DNA will be&#xD;
      determined using the NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA) and&#xD;
      QubitFluorometer 1.0 (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad, CA). The extracted DNA will be amplified by&#xD;
      PCR with the primers: forward: 5'-CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG-3 'and reverse:&#xD;
      5'-GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC-3' (Klindworth et al.2013), which target the hypervariable region V3&#xD;
      and V4 of the 16S rRNA gene . Each PCR amplification will be performed by protocol for the&#xD;
      preparation of 16S libraries for metagenomic sequencing (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The&#xD;
      amplification products will be quantified by the Qubit fluoridator (Invitrogen Co., Carlsbad,&#xD;
      CA) and grouped at an equimolar amount of each sample with a final concentration of 2nM. A&#xD;
      Phix control library (Illumina) will be added to the samples. The grouped samples will then&#xD;
      be sequenced on the MiSeq Platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA). The data thus obtained will be&#xD;
      subjected to quality controls by bioinformatics analysis with FastQC. Finally, the data will&#xD;
      be analyzed according to the statistical tests suggested by the guidelines for metagenomic&#xD;
      sequencing. Patient data will be compared with each other and over time with reference&#xD;
      databases. The evaluation of the epigenetic activity of the microbiota and the biochemical&#xD;
      dosages of cytokines and free radicals will be performed at the laboratory of Pharmacology of&#xD;
      the University of Campania &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli. In particular, for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      epigenetic activity of the microbiota of each individual hyperglycemic v/s normoglycemic&#xD;
      patient with STEMI, we will proceed according to the protocol QIAGEN (Italy) with the&#xD;
      extraction from faecal material of the total RNA, including the low-weight one molecular&#xD;
      (microRNA). The final yield and quality of the extracted RNA will be determined using the&#xD;
      NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (ThermoScientific, Waltham, MA). Through qRT-PCR (QIAGEN,&#xD;
      Italy) the expression levels of the following fecal microRNAs will be detected: miR-10b,&#xD;
      miR-204, miR-29, miR-496, miR-1224-5p, miR-470 and miR-663 involved in the regulation of the&#xD;
      intestinal microbiota; miR-10a and miR-18b involved in the regulation of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota and metabolic inflammation; miR-106a, miR-17, miR-19a, miR-20a, miR-206, miR-222&#xD;
      and miR-223 involved in metabolic inflammation and signaling insulin/IGF-1 (26). The&#xD;
      metabolic activity of the microbiota in each individual hyperglycaemic v/s normoglycemic&#xD;
      patient with STEMI will be evaluated by determination of short chain fatty acids (SCFA) from&#xD;
      faecal samples: the levels of fecal SCFA, a product of bacterial fermentation, seem to&#xD;
      correlate with an improvement in type 2 diabetes (27). The inflammatory activity of the&#xD;
      microbiota will be evaluated by determining the fecal levels of LPS (28-29), IL-1β and IL-6&#xD;
      (30-32), while the oxidative activity through the analysis of fecal levels of ROS, SOD and&#xD;
      GSH (33-34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Authors' study is designed to manage hyperglycaemic v/s normoglycemic patients with&#xD;
      STEMI in the &quot;real life&quot;, without interference from the rigid rules that limit the&#xD;
      generalisability of RCTs. Therefore, after discharge from the hospital, all patients will be&#xD;
      invited to carry out the control visits, as indicated by the guidelines for the management of&#xD;
      post-STEMI patients (6), at the Cardiology Division of the University of Campania &quot;Luigi&#xD;
      Vanvitelli&quot;, and at the VI Division of Internal Medicine of the &quot;Luigi Vanvitelli&quot; University&#xD;
      of Campania. All patients will be monitored for 12 months after the event, as follow-up, to&#xD;
      practice clinical evaluation (ECG, exercise test, echocardiogram, glucose levels), as&#xD;
      indicated by the guidelines for the management of STEMI patients (6). At these time points,&#xD;
      stool samples will also be taken for the analysis of the microbiota. Moreover, in the&#xD;
      management and assessment of the glycemic compensation in the 12 months of follow-up, the&#xD;
      physician will also be involved in order to maintain HbA1c levels &lt;7%, glycemia between 90&#xD;
      and 140 mg / dl and postprandial glycemia &lt;180 mg / dl.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular endpoints The cardiovascular end points in both cohorts will include&#xD;
      myocardial re-infarction, re-hospitalization for coronary artery disease (re-stenosis, stent&#xD;
      implantation or aorto-coronary bypass), heart failure, stroke, cardiac mortality, and all&#xD;
      causes of mortality. The primary composite end point will consist of cardiovascular events,&#xD;
      such as myocardial infarction, hospitalization for heart failure, stroke or cardiac&#xD;
      mortality. The secondary end point will consist in the evaluation of cardiac function:&#xD;
      reduction of ejection fraction, increase in volume of the left ventricle, reduction of&#xD;
      coronary perfusion. All deaths will be reviewed and classified as cardiac (death caused by&#xD;
      IMA, ventricular arrhythmias, refractory heart failure) or non-cardiac. All&#xD;
      revascularizations will be classified as early (elective revascularization within 60 days&#xD;
      after coronary angiography) or late. Only late revascularizations will be classified as&#xD;
      cardiac events, so patients with early elective revascularization will be excluded from the&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis The two groups will be compared using the Pearson χ2 test for&#xD;
      categorical variables and the Kruskal-Wallis test for continuous variables. The covariate&#xD;
      candidates for entry into the multivariable model will be identified by concentrating on the&#xD;
      factors those that will significantly differ (P value &lt;0.05) in the univariate analysis&#xD;
      between hyperglycemic v/s normoglycemic patients. Cox regression will be used to build the&#xD;
      mortality model. The Hazard Ratio for mortality will be adjusted for age, BMI, cholesterol,&#xD;
      LDL, triglycerides and aspirin therapy, ticlopidine, combination of anti-aggregants,&#xD;
      β-blockers, ACE inhibitors or sartans, antidiabetics, statins, during hospitalization for&#xD;
      STEMI. Survival analysis through the first year from STEMI will be performed using the&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier curve and Cox regression method. The mortality curves will be obtained&#xD;
      separately for hyperglycaemic patients v/s normoglycemia, to be compared using the log-rank&#xD;
      test. All tests will be considered significant if p value &lt;0.05. All analyzes will be carried&#xD;
      out in the two study populations. A &quot;propensity score&quot; analysis will be performed using a&#xD;
      &quot;non parsimonious&quot; logistic regression model that will compare the outcomes of the&#xD;
      hyperglycemic v / s normoglycemic patients. More variables will be included in the model&#xD;
      including age, sex, diabetes, hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, multivessel disease,&#xD;
      chronic renal failure, TIMI pre-procedure flow, ejection fraction and procedural success. The&#xD;
      C-score will indicate good discrimination. Based on the &quot;matched&quot; samples, the Cox&#xD;
      proportional risk model will be used to determine the impact of hyperglycemia, and of&#xD;
      microbiotic flora activity on mortality during follow-up. SPSS (version 21, IBM SPSS) will be&#xD;
      used for all analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size The Sample Size will be calculated with IBM PC computer by GPOWER software. The&#xD;
      size effect will be calculated according to the epidemiological and interventional studies&#xD;
      performed on hyperglycaemic patients. The sample size estimated on a global effect of 25%&#xD;
      with type I error of 0.05 and a power of 95% will be 200 participants, 100 for the group&#xD;
      composed of normoglycemic patients and 100 for the group of hyperglycaemic patients.&#xD;
