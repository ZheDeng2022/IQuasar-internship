  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partial breast irradiation is typically performed after surgical removal of the tumor.&#xD;
      Partial breast irradiation allows for focused radiation to the area from which the cancer was&#xD;
      removed, sparing breast tissue from the potential bad effects of radiation compared to&#xD;
      radiating the whole breast, which was the standard of care for many years. This study is&#xD;
      evaluating the use of partial breast irradiation with NIBB performed before surgery instead&#xD;
      of after surgery.This should allow researchers to target the cancer even more accurately and&#xD;
      result in less normal breast tissue receiving radiation which may cause less side effects&#xD;
      and/or a better cosmetic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study partial breast treatment will be given with NIBB in 5 treatments over about 1&#xD;
      week. Surgical removal of the tumor will then be performed between 4-12 weeks following&#xD;
      radiation treatment. Researchers believe that participant's risk of complications from&#xD;
      surgery will not be higher after getting these radiation treatments than it would have been&#xD;
      if participants had surgery first, but that is one of the things researchers are studying.&#xD;
