  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      General anesthesia has an important effect on inflammatory cytokines. Inhalational agents as&#xD;
      isoflurane and sevoflurane attenuate immune function expressed by neutrophil&#xD;
      chemoattractant-1 as well as inflammatory enzyme and also they reduce inflammatory cascade.&#xD;
      Total intravenous anesthesia (TIVA) based on using propofol suppresses the inflammatory&#xD;
      response caused by surgery to a greater extent because Propofol affects the balance between&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines, increasing production of the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and at the same time reducing the increase of IL-6 during&#xD;
      the perioperative period. It also alters expression of nitric oxide and inhibits neutrophil&#xD;
      function. TIVA has many advantages such as; fewer side effects, earlier discharge, better&#xD;
      patient satisfaction, faster recovery, less nausea and vomiting and reduced muscle relaxant&#xD;
      requirements. Paravertebral block has an important role in the inflammatory and immune&#xD;
      response. The paravertebral block can decrease perioperative inflammation and prevent immune&#xD;
      suppression. Also, it can attenuate the cytokine response and reduce acute stress response&#xD;
      caused by surgery. Decrease inflammation processes, improve surgery result, limit the&#xD;
      duration of hospital stay, decrease post-operative fatigue and reduce postoperative&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Spine surgery is characterized by an elevation in levels of the inflammatory cytokines such&#xD;
      as interleukin IL-6, IL-1β, and IL-17. These cytokines promote chemokine production and&#xD;
      changes in cell phenotype which lead to activation of T and B cells, macrophages,&#xD;
      neutrophils, and mast cells further amplifying the inflammatory cascade. Different analgesic&#xD;
      modalities are used for pain management during and after spine surgery as narcotic&#xD;
      analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, Paracetamol and neuraxial techniques like&#xD;
      intrathecal drug administration, epidural analgesia and paravertebral block. In this study,&#xD;
      Paravertebral Block is used as a new and recent analgesic strategy for spine surgery. It has&#xD;
      the advantage of higher success rate and analgesic efficacy, less risk of neurological&#xD;
      complications than most other regional anesthetic techniques, less nausea, vomiting, and&#xD;
      constipation compared with opioid-based analgesic techniques, urinary retention does not&#xD;
      occur, unlike neuraxial techniques and intense block of both the sympathetic and somatic&#xD;
      nerves. This study will be conducted with the hypothesis that the addition of paravertebral&#xD;
      block as an analgesic regimen with total intravenous anesthesia (propofol-based) will have a&#xD;
      better Immunomodulatory effect in patients undergoing posterior lumbar spine fixation&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;

Locate the desired segment shift from the cephalad aspect of the sacrum. The transverse scan will show a hyperechoic outline of the vertebral spinous and transverse processes. Use the loss of resistance technique. Bilaterally inject (5ml) bupivacaine 0.5% for each segment. Induction of anesthesia after 30 minutes with fentanyl, (1mcg / kg), propofol (1-2 mg / kg), atracurium (0.5 mg / kg),then prone position.</description>
