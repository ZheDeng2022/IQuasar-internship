  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Walled of necrosis (WON) is severe local complication of acute necrotizing pancreatitis.&#xD;
      Disconnected pancreatic duct syndrome(DPDS) is commonly seen (50-60%) after necrotizing&#xD;
      pancreatitis and has long term implication like recurrent pancreatic fluid collections (PFC)]&#xD;
      requiring re-intervention. Incidence of recurrent PFC is more common in patients with DPDS&#xD;
      (17-50%) compared to others. Studies has shown permanent in-dwelling transmural stent reduces&#xD;
      recurrence of PFC (1.7% vs 17.4%, p&lt;0.001). Nowadays,WON is effectively managed with&#xD;
      endoscopic step up approach (96%). Several studies showed dedicated self-expandable metal&#xD;
      stent (SEMS) are effective compared to the plastic stents in management of WON with decreased&#xD;
      need of re-intervention. However, SEMS cannot be kept for longer duration because of&#xD;
      associated adverse events. So, experts recommend to remove SEMS within 4-6 weeks of&#xD;
      placement. Considering this background, study is planned with aim to see the effect of&#xD;
      transmural plastic stenting on recurrence of PFC after SEMS removal in walled off necrosis&#xD;
      with DPDS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute necrotizing pancreatitis (ANP) is lethal complication and account for 10-20% of total&#xD;
      pancreatitis. Necrotic collection is seen in majority of ANP and &gt;50% of necrotic collection&#xD;
      transform into Walled of necrosis (WON). Management of WON is challenging and under&#xD;
      progressive evolution. With the advent of &quot;step up approach&quot; WON is effectively managed with&#xD;
      greater success. Various studies and meta-analysis proved the efficacy of dedicated&#xD;
      self-expandable metal stents (SEMS) over plastic stent in WON management. Disconnected&#xD;
      pancreatic duct syndrome (DPDS) is late complication of necrotizing pancreatitis and&#xD;
      increasingly identified after necrosectomy. DPDS is defined as complete disruption of the&#xD;
      main pancreatic duct, resulting in a variable portion of the upstream pancreatic gland&#xD;
      becoming isolated from the main pancreatic duct downstream. Ductal disruption leads to&#xD;
      accumulation of pancreatic juice forming pancreatic or peri-pancreatic fluid collection.&#xD;
      Incidence of recurrence of PFC in DPD is ~ 50%. DPDS is a separate clinical entity which&#xD;
      demands special strategic approach and requires frequent re-intervention&#xD;
      (surgical/endoscopic). Treatment option for DPDS is controversial and not yet clearly&#xD;
      defined. Studies have shown that long term transmural plastic stent placement can reduce the&#xD;
      recurrence rate (Stent removed-17% vs stent left behind-1.7%). So, some experts recommend&#xD;
      that transmural stents can be left in situ indefinitely to decrease recurrence of PFC.&#xD;
      Nowadays, SEMS are widely used for management of WON. However, metal stents cannot be kept&#xD;
      for longer period because of increasing adverse events associated with longer duration&#xD;
      (impaction/burring of SEMS in gastric wall, bleeding). So, recommendation is to remove SEMS&#xD;
      as early as possible (within 4-6 weeks of drainage). Considering this fact, study is planned&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of transmural plastic stenting on recurrence of PFC after SEMS removal&#xD;
      in walled off necrosis with DPDS. This will be randomised control study in patients with WON&#xD;
      with DPDS who underwent SEMS drainage. After removal of SEMS patients with documented DPDS&#xD;
      (magnetic resonance pancreatography and endoscopic retrograde pancreatography) will be&#xD;
      randomised into 2 arms. In study arm after SEMS removal transmural plastic stent will be&#xD;
      placed in to the cavity and in control arm SEMS will be removed with no transmural stenting.&#xD;
      Thereafter patients will be followed at 3 months,6 months and yearly.&#xD;
