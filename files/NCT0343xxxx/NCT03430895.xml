        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years at time of informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt; 30 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed small cell carcinoma, squamous cell&#xD;
             carcinoma or adenocarcinoma (confirmed at MSKCC) of the bladder, ureter, urethra,&#xD;
             urachus, or renal pelvis. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma are&#xD;
             required to have a predominant squamous or adenocarcinoma component as reviewed by the&#xD;
             pathologist at MSKCC. However, if any element of small cell or neuroendocrine&#xD;
             differentiation is present, the patients will be classified as small&#xD;
             cell/neuroendocrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmation of availability of sufficient tissue from a prior surgery for correlative&#xD;
             studies is required prior to enrollment. Patients must have representative non-TCC or&#xD;
             the urothelial tract FFPE archival tumor specimens (tumor blocks or 30 unstained&#xD;
             slides; preference for tumor blocks). These samples may be submitted between the time&#xD;
             of consent and the start of treatment. Patients with &lt; 30 slides may be enrolled after&#xD;
             discussion with the principal or co-principal investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical evidence of metastatic (T4b, any N; any T, N2-3; M1) disease.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with small cell carcinoma must have progressed after at least one prior&#xD;
             systemic therapy. Patients with squamous cell carcinoma or adenocarcinoma may be&#xD;
             previously untreated or have progressed after prior systemic therapy. Chemotherapy&#xD;
             administered in conjunction with primary radiation as a radio-sensitizer WILL be&#xD;
             counted as a systemic chemotherapy regimen. NOTE: There is no maximum number of prior&#xD;
             treatments allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with brain metastases are allowed onto the study as long as patients have&#xD;
             completed their treatment for brain metastasis, no longer require corticosteroids, and&#xD;
             are asymptomatic. Subjects with neurological symptoms should undergo a head CT scan or&#xD;
             brain MRI to exclude brain metastasis, at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Evidence of post-menopausal status or negative serum pregnancy test for female&#xD;
                  pre-menopausal patients. Women will be considered post-menopausal if they have&#xD;
                  been amenorrheic for 12 months without an alternative medical cause. The&#xD;
                  following age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                       amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;

                       surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
                       amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous&#xD;
                       hormonal treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1&#xD;
                       year ago, had chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago,&#xD;
                       or underwent surgical sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral&#xD;
                       salpingectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female patients of reproductive potential and non-sterilized males who are&#xD;
                  sexually active with a female partner of childbearing potential must be willing&#xD;
                  to adhere to the following restrictions:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Females of reproductive potential who are sexually active with a&#xD;
                       non-sterilized male partner must agree to use at least 1 highly effective&#xD;
                       method of contraception (Table 3) from the time of screening until 180 days&#xD;
                       after the last dose of durvalumab + tremelimumab combination therapy or 90&#xD;
                       days after the last dose of durvalumab monotherapy. Cessation of birth&#xD;
                       control after this point should be discussed with a responsible physician.&#xD;
                       Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the withdrawal method are not&#xD;
                       acceptable methods of birth control. It is strongly recommended that&#xD;
                       non-sterilized male partners of a female patient must use male condom plus&#xD;
                       spermicide throughout this period. Not engaging in sexual activity for the&#xD;
                       total duration of the drug treatment and the drug washout period is an&#xD;
                       acceptable practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Non-sterilized males who are sexually active with a female partner of&#xD;
                       childbearing potential must use a male condom plus spermicide from screening&#xD;
                       through 180 days after receipt of the final dose of durvalumab +&#xD;
                       tremelimumab combination therapy or 90 days after receipt of the final dose&#xD;
                       of durvalumab monotherapy. Periodic abstinence, the rhythm method, and the&#xD;
                       withdrawal method are not acceptable methods of birth control. Not engaging&#xD;
                       in sexual activity is an acceptable practice. Male patients should refrain&#xD;
                       from sperm donation throughout this period. It is strongly recommended that&#xD;
                       female partners (of childbearing potential) of male patients to also use a&#xD;
                       highly effective method of contraception throughout this period.&#xD;
