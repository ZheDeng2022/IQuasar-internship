  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our cluster randomized controlled trial of a novel clinical practice change will IMPACT the&#xD;
      physical activity (PA) of children living with congenital heart defects (CHD) through our&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovative and pragmatic approach to systematically incorporate PA counselling within each&#xD;
      clinic visit. Long-term, the focus is to prevent or treat the most common secondary&#xD;
      morbidities of these patients (atherosclerosis, anxiety, depression) through enhanced PA. We&#xD;
      have previously shown that home-based, PA interventions can increase daily PA and enhance PA&#xD;
      motivation, motor skill and fitness when delivered via an intensive research intervention.&#xD;
      Our objectives for this study are to&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measure the feasibility and efficacy of PA counselling using clinical resources among&#xD;
      paediatric CHD patients (daily PA, PA motivation, competence, quality of life) and on clinic&#xD;
      systems (% patients counselled, clinic/kinesiology personnel support required, clinic visit&#xD;
      time, # of PA questions). Our&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-empowering, ready-to-use, self-explanatory &quot;tool kit&quot; of clinician PA resources and&#xD;
      patient/family/clinician friendly searchable electronic PA database will be used to promote&#xD;
      the&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active lifestyles that are critically important to physical/mental health, peer socialization&#xD;
      &amp; childhood growth/development. 90% of children are not active enough for optimal health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We initially target children with CHD because they are less active than peers, and their most&#xD;
      important secondary morbidities can be prevented or treated through PA. Our&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborative approach with patients, their families and leaders in paediatric cardiac&#xD;
      healthcare will optimize our &quot;PA tool kit&quot; and novel practice change for&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation to all paediatric CHD healthcare systems (primary, secondary, tertiary) through&#xD;
      our pan-Canadian Cardiac Kids Quality of LIFFE Research and Knowledge Exchange Network, a&#xD;
      collaborative of 10 patient/family support networks and 10 paediatric cardiac clinics in 6&#xD;
      provinces focused on Learning, Independence, Friends, Fitness &amp; Emotional health (LIFFE).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inactive lifestyles have a huge cost to Canadians' health, our economy and healthcare system&#xD;
      (3.7% of total healthcare costs, 2009=$6.8B19). If 10% of Canadians were more active, 25-yr&#xD;
      healthcare costs would drop by $2.6B, $7.5B would be added to our economy, &amp; 550,000 fewer&#xD;
      Canadians would live with chronic disease. Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common&#xD;
      congenital condition (12/1000 births) and a major health burden. 90% of CHD children live 4&#xD;
      to 8 decades with a 3-5X higher risk for atherosclerosis, anxiety or depression. Physical&#xD;
      activity is known to decrease these important health risks. &lt;10% of Canadian children are&#xD;
      active enough for optimal health and, regardless of severity, CHD children are even less&#xD;
      active. Individualized kinesiology support can improve physical activity (PA) skill,&#xD;
      confidence and participation among CHD children but exceeds current clinical care resources.&#xD;
      In response, our team of patients, parents, and clinicians developed a &quot;tool kit&quot; of 12&#xD;
      child/family-friendly PA resources to enable clinicians to better address the most important&#xD;
      PA issues for these patients. Our randomized, controlled trial will evaluate a clinical&#xD;
      practice change (systematic PA counselling with the PA tool kit plus PA in CHD database) on&#xD;
      patient PA and health system outcomes in small (London), medium (Ottawa) and large (Edmonton)&#xD;
      paediatric cardiac clinics. Randomization will be by week within each study site to prevent&#xD;
      potential intervention cross contamination between children in clinic at the same time.&#xD;
      Primary outcome is daily pedometer steps over 1 week. Secondary outcomes are quality of life&#xD;
      (PedsQL), physical literacy (CAPL screen) and PA motivation (CSAPPA). Health system outcomes&#xD;
      will be: % patients receiving intervention, clinic visit time, # of non-clinic contacts about&#xD;
      PA, and need for kinesiology referral. Patient outcomes will be assessed during the CHD&#xD;
      clinic visit and at 6 months, with pedometer steps also measured each month. We will enroll&#xD;
      consecutive CHD patients with moderate or severe CHD, 5 - 17 yrs, &amp; no other diagnosis&#xD;
      affecting PA. Based on our data from previous PA studies among CHD patients and anticipating&#xD;
      10 patients/month, we would require 15 months of data collection (10% dropout) to obtain the&#xD;
      136 complete data sets required to provide 80% power to detect a clinically meaningful&#xD;
      increase in daily PA of 1000 steps/day. Repeated measures ANOVA will evaluate study group&#xD;
      impact (control/intervention) on pedometer steps. Secondary ANCOVA models will adjust for&#xD;
      age, sex, treatment history and clinic site (Ottawa, London, Edmonton).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research team combines expertise in clinical intervention trials (Longmuir) and study&#xD;
      design and analyses (Willan) with patient (Graham) &amp; family (Rouble) experience plus &gt; 60&#xD;
      years of clinical expertise (Lougheed, Norozi, Mackie). All investigators have previous&#xD;
      experience leading multi-site research projects and supervising graduate students. Graham&#xD;
      (Can. Congenital Heart Alliance) will ensure intervention relevance and scalability to all&#xD;
      Canadian CHD patients. CHEO Family Forum (Rouble) will provide parent input. Through this&#xD;
      study, we will advance knowledge of healthy, active lifestyles &amp; PA support for CHD patients&#xD;
      &amp; the health system impacts of current practice recommendations to promote PA to CHD patients&#xD;
      at every clinical encounter.&#xD;
