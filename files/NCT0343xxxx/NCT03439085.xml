    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) plasmid-encoding&#xD;
      interleukin-12/human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 and&#xD;
      durvalumab work in treating patients with human papillomavirus associated cancers that have&#xD;
      come back or spread to other places in the body. Vaccines made from a gene-modified virus may&#xD;
      help the body build an effective immune response to kill tumor cells. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as durvalumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving DNA&#xD;
      plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 and durvalumab&#xD;
      may work better in treating patients with human papillomavirus associated cancers.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the anti-tumor activity of DNA plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA&#xD;
      plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 (MEDI0457) in combination with durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of MEDI0457 in combination with durvalumab in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent/metastatic human papilloma virus (HPV) 16- or 18- associated cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) of patients&#xD;
      with recurrent/metastatic incurable HPV-16/18 positive solid malignancies receiving the&#xD;
      combination of MEDI0457and durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate objective response rate (ORR) by immune-related criteria of the combination&#xD;
      of MEDI0457 and durvalumab in patients with recurrent/metastatic incurable HPV-16/18 positive&#xD;
      solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the disease control rate at 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the cellular and humoral immune response to immunotherapy with MEDI0457 in&#xD;
      combination with durvalumab,&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To examine the correlation between anti tumor activity and biomarkers including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      IIa. HPV-specific cellular and humoral responses. IIb. Programmed death ligand 1 status. IIc.&#xD;
      The number of tumor infiltrating lymphocytes, HPV 16/18 E6/E7 deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      levels and HPV 16/18 E6/E7 DNA sequence in biopsy tissue and plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the pharmacokinetics and anti-drug antibodies (ADA) for durvalumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive DNA plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine&#xD;
      INO-3112 intramuscularly (IM) and via electroporation at 1, 3, 7, and 12 weeks and durvalumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) at 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Starting week 12, cycles repeat every 8 weeks for&#xD;
      DNA plasmid-encoding interleukin-12/HPV DNA plasmids therapeutic vaccine INO-3112 and every 4&#xD;
      weeks for up to 13 doses of durvalumab in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 90 days, every 3 months for&#xD;
      12 months, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;

          -  Any medical condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with&#xD;
             evaluation of the study treatment or interpretation of patient safety or study&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active or prior digestive tract bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fewer than two acceptable sites exist for intramuscular (IM) injection and&#xD;
             electroporation (EP) between the deltoid and lateral quadriceps muscles. Note: a site&#xD;
             for injection/EP is not acceptable if there are tattoos or scars within 2 cm of the&#xD;
             proposed injection/EP site or if there is implanted metal within the same limb. Any&#xD;
             device implanted in the chest (e.g. cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator) excludes the&#xD;
             use of the deltoid muscle on the same side of the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to provide informed consent, are incarcerated, or are unable&#xD;
             to follow protocol requirements.&#xD;
