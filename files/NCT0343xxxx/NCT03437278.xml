  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      ligelizumab in children from 12 to &lt; 18 years of age, with chronic spontaneous urticaria&#xD;
      (CSU). The participants were treated with ligelizumab as an add-on therapy to approved doses&#xD;
      of H1 antihistamines (H1AH) following the guideline on treatment of CSU.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase IIb dose-finding, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, multicenter study in adolescent patients. The study consisted of 3&#xD;
      distinct study periods: Screening, Treatment and Follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening period (up to 4 weeks), at Day 1 participants were randomized into one of&#xD;
      the three treatment arms in 1:2:1 fashion to ligelizumab high dose (120 mg every four weeks&#xD;
      (q4w)) versus ligelizumab low dose (24 mg q4w) versus placebo. During the 24 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment period, doses were administered on Day 1 then on weeks 4, 8, 12, 16, and 20 weeks&#xD;
      after randomization. Participants randomized to placebo received placebo on Day 1, Weeks 4&#xD;
      and 8; thereafter they received 120 mg ligelizumab (high dose) on Weeks 12, 16 and 20 such&#xD;
      that by the end of the study, the same number of participants received ligelizumab high dose&#xD;
      as low dose. The treatment period was followed by a treatment-free follow-up period of 16&#xD;
      weeks to a maximum of Week 40.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change From Baseline of Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) at Week 24</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, week 24</time_frame>
    <description>UAS7 is a self-reported scoring system to evaluate urticaria signs and symptoms. UAS7 is the sum of daily urticaria activity scores (UAS) over a seven-day period. The possible range of UAS7 score is 0 to 42 (0 to 6 for daily UAS x 7 days). A higher urticaria activity score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline was calculated using data from the 7 days prior to the first treatment date.&#xD;
To handle the missing data, if a participant had at least 4 non-missing daily scores within the 7 days prior to a study visit, the weekly score was calculated as the sum of the available scores in that week, divided by the number of days with daily scores available, multiplied by 7. However, if there were less than 4 non-missing daily scores within the prior 7 days, then the weekly score was missing for the week.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline of the Children Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, weeks 12, 24 and 40</time_frame>
    <description>The children dermatology life quality index questionnaire is a 10-item dermatology- specific health-related quality of life measure designed for use in children. Participants rated their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives. The CDLQI total score is a sum of all 10 item responses, each individual response ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Total score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to or on the first treatment date.&#xD;
To handle the missing data, if a participant had only one item missing score per visit, then it was imputed to 0 and total score was calculated accordingly. If there were 2 or more item missing scores per visit, then the total score for the visit was considered as missing.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of Weekly Urticaria Activity Score (UAS7) at Week 24</title>
        <description>UAS7 is a self-reported scoring system to evaluate urticaria signs and symptoms. UAS7 is the sum of daily urticaria activity scores (UAS) over a seven-day period. The possible range of UAS7 score is 0 to 42 (0 to 6 for daily UAS x 7 days). A higher urticaria activity score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline was calculated using data from the 7 days prior to the first treatment date.&#xD;
To handle the missing data, if a participant had at least 4 non-missing daily scores within the 7 days prior to a study visit, the weekly score was calculated as the sum of the available scores in that week, divided by the number of days with daily scores available, multiplied by 7. However, if there were less than 4 non-missing daily scores within the prior 7 days, then the weekly score was missing for the week.</description>

          <description>UAS7 is a self-reported scoring system to evaluate urticaria signs and symptoms. UAS7 is the sum of daily urticaria activity scores (UAS) over a seven-day period. The possible range of UAS7 score is 0 to 42 (0 to 6 for daily UAS x 7 days). A higher urticaria activity score indicates more severe symptoms. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline was calculated using data from the 7 days prior to the first treatment date.&#xD;
To handle the missing data, if a participant had at least 4 non-missing daily scores within the 7 days prior to a study visit, the weekly score was calculated as the sum of the available scores in that week, divided by the number of days with daily scores available, multiplied by 7. However, if there were less than 4 non-missing daily scores within the prior 7 days, then the weekly score was missing for the week.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of Weekly Hives Severity Score (HSS7)</title>
        <description>HSS7 is the sum of daily Hives Severity Score (HSS) over a seven-day period. The possible range of HSS7 score is 0-21 (0-3 for daily HSS x 7 days), where 0 is defined as complete HSS7 response (no wheals) and 21 is the worst score. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline was calculated using data from the 7 days prior to the first treatment date.&#xD;
To handle the missing data, if a participant had at least 4 non-missing daily scores within the 7 days prior to a study visit, the weekly score was calculated as the sum of the available scores in that week, divided by the number of days with daily scores available, multiplied by 7. However, if there were less than 4 non-missing daily scores within the prior 7 days, then the weekly score was missing for the week.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline of the Children Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI)</title>
        <description>The children dermatology life quality index questionnaire is a 10-item dermatology- specific health-related quality of life measure designed for use in children. Participants rated their dermatology symptoms as well as the impact of their skin condition on various aspects of their lives. The CDLQI total score is a sum of all 10 item responses, each individual response ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Total score ranges from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating greater health-related quality of life impairment. A negative change score from baseline indicates improvement. Baseline was defined as the last non-missing value prior to or on the first treatment date.&#xD;
To handle the missing data, if a participant had only one item missing score per visit, then it was imputed to 0 and total score was calculated accordingly. If there were 2 or more item missing scores per visit, then the total score for the visit was considered as missing.</description>
