      The purpose of this study is to assess whether there is a difference between the TomoFix and&#xD;
      Ellipse Intramedullary HTO Nail System in terms of bone regeneration in the tibial wedge by&#xD;
      performing a CT-scan at 3 and 6-months postoperatively.&#xD;

      Malalignment of the knee joint causes arthritis in later life. Currently there are three&#xD;
      surgical ways to treat knee arthritis: total knee replacement, partial knee replacement, and&#xD;
      high tibial osteotomy (HTO). The former two very much focus on treating the effect of&#xD;
      malalignment, i.e. removing the arthritic joint. However, HTO addresses the cause of the&#xD;
      arthritis, namely the joint malalignment. This preserves the patient's joint and it means&#xD;
      that a patient will start using the unaffected part of the knee joint more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HTO involves cutting a wedge out the tibia to correct the alignment of that bone with the&#xD;
      knee joint, to redistribute load from the affected medial part to lateral part. To keep the&#xD;
      tibia in the new position, a medical nail device is attached to keep it in place and allow&#xD;
      new bone to regenerate within the wedge. Currently, the market leader for HTO is the TomoFix&#xD;
      (by DePuySynthes company) plate and nail device. As the name suggests, TomoFix is fixed at&#xD;
      surgery and therefore the change in bone angle cannot be changed afterwards. It does mean&#xD;
      that patients can be weight-bearing on the affected leg soon after the HTO procedure. A new&#xD;
      CE-marked device is being tested in an interventional trial; it is produced by Ellipse&#xD;
      Technologies. This device is an extendable nail and inserted intramedullary; following&#xD;
      surgery the nail is tend slowly extended over a period of time until the bone correction is&#xD;
      satisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CISKO imaging study will assess whether there is a difference between the TomoFix and&#xD;
      Ellipse system in terms of bone regeneration in the tibial wedge by performing a CT-scan at 3&#xD;
      and 6 months post-operatively. This will be quantified by two independent radiological&#xD;
      reports. A secondary objective is to investigate patient satisfaction and also patient pain&#xD;
      levels at these time intervals. The degree of bone healing is usually the main factor holding&#xD;
      clinicians back when it comes to advising patients on what activities they can return to&#xD;
      post-operatively. A difference in bone healing between the two systems may impact on the&#xD;
      advice clinicians can give patients regarding recommencing more intense activities such as&#xD;
      recreational sports, which ultimately could positively impact patients' health and&#xD;
      well-being.&#xD;

    <description>Healing of the osteotomy site after final correction as assessed by two independent radiology reports based on visual assessment of the CT imaging. The scoring system is derived from a study by Brosset and colleagues (Brosset et al, 2011). In addition to a pure clinician perspective of the healing process, CT imaging data will also be used to quantify and describe:&#xD;
definition of osteotomy line,&#xD;
osteotomy margin,&#xD;
osteotomy gap,&#xD;
callus appearances,&#xD;
callus to cortex ratio,&#xD;
bridging of the bone, including complete union and healing.&#xD;
application of region of interest (ROI) to quantify bone density of the callus formation</description>
