  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We have designed OVATION-65 to evaluate the effects of permissive low blood pressure compared&#xD;
      to usual care on markers of organ injury and survival in older patients.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When it is severe, hypotension compromises tissue perfusion and organ function, leading to&#xD;
      multiple organ failure and death. Commonly in intensive care units (ICUs), excessive&#xD;
      vasodilation causes hypotension. In response, clinicians administer vasopressors to induce&#xD;
      vasoconstriction and thereby raise blood pressure. However, these medications may reduce&#xD;
      blood flow to vital organs, including the heart, and therefore damage them. Titrating&#xD;
      vasopressors therefore requires balancing the risks of organ dysfunction arising from&#xD;
      vasopressors or hypotension. Current guidelines recommend titrating vasopressors to a mean&#xD;
      arterial pressure (MAP) of 65 mmHg. By not specifying an upper limit, guidelines and&#xD;
      clinicians put more emphasis on preventing hypotension than on minimizing vasopressor&#xD;
      exposure. Permissive hypotension, defined as a MAP target below traditional levels, may&#xD;
      reduce vasopressor-induced harm while avoiding organ dysfunction induced by severe&#xD;
      hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observational data show that the average MAP in Canadian patients on vasopressors is 75 mmHg,&#xD;
      10 mmHg above current guideline recommendations and self-reported practices.The recent&#xD;
      CIHR-funded OVATION pilot RCT (n=118) of permissive hypotension met feasibility objectives of&#xD;
      demonstrating a separation in mean MAP between arms (9 mmHg, p&lt;0.0001) and enrolling patients&#xD;
      efficiently (2.3 patients/site/month). Investigators have also completed an individual&#xD;
      patient data meta-analysis with the French SEPSISPAM trial and found that a lower MAP target&#xD;
      may be beneficial in patients 65 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching goal of this randomized controlled trial (RCT) of permissive hypotension vs.&#xD;
      usual blood pressure targets in hypotensive patients ≥65 years old is to determine whether&#xD;
      permissive hypotension reduces the risk of harm associated with usual vasopressor therapy.&#xD;
      The proposed RCT has specific objectives to ascertain the effect of permissive hypotension&#xD;
      vs. usual care on: 1) markers of organ injury (primarily in the heart at day 3, secondarily&#xD;
      (on day 3 and day 7) in the brain, liver, intestine, and skeletal muscle); 2) global tissue&#xD;
      dysoxia (assessed by plasma lactate); 3) organ function (assessed by Sequential Organ Failure&#xD;
      Assessment [SOFA] Score ); 4) resource utilization, 5) pre-specified adverse events, 6)&#xD;
      mortality at 90 days and 6 months; 7) cognitive impairment in survivors at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to target MAP 60-65 mmHg vs. usual care. By comparing&#xD;
      permissive hypotension to usual care, we improve acceptance from clinicians and reduce the&#xD;
      risk that the control group will diverge widely from usual care. Investigators will enroll&#xD;
      patients in 7 Canadian ICUs. The deferred consent model will be adopted, successfully used in&#xD;
      the pilot trial. Risk of bias will be minimized by allocation concealment, blinding of&#xD;
      outcome assessors, complete hospital follow-up and intention-to-treat analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This RCT proposal is embedded in the international OVATION-65 program of research, which&#xD;
      includes the ongoing NIHR-funded UK65 Trial which measures 90-day mortality as the primary&#xD;
      outcome. The Canadian OVATION-65 RCT is the only trial that measures organ injury biomarkers,&#xD;
      providing crucial clinical information regardless of the effect on mortality. Results are&#xD;
      expected to be incorporated into guidelines to inform practice worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OVATION-65 Trial was designed to be complementary to the 65 Trial conducted in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom. The original proposal, which consisted in a larger and simpler trial (n=800&#xD;
      participants, focused on biomarkers of organ injury) was abandoned because funding&#xD;
      applications to the Canadian Institutes for Health Research and the Canadian Frailty Network&#xD;
      were unsuccessful. The current trial was supported by a combination of multiple more modest&#xD;
      operating grants awarded by the Université de Sherbrooke and the Centre de Recherche du CHU&#xD;
      de Sherbrooke (see Funding sources). However, each grant required a distinct objective&#xD;
      increasing the complexity of the analysis plan and sample size calculation. Certain analyses&#xD;
      were incorporated into funding applications for local experiments on a small scale. By&#xD;
      combining funds from multiple sources, we are able to enroll up to 200 participants, however&#xD;
      we lack resources to measure every outcome on 200 participants. Outcomes that cannot be&#xD;
      measured on every participant or as well as those that were planned originally but that&#xD;
      remain unfunded are described briefly in the secondary outcomes section and specified as&#xD;
      ancillary studies. They will be reported separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attempts to obtain funding for a larger OVATION-65 Trial continued until the end of 2018.&#xD;
      Sufficient funding was secured to enroll up to 200 patients, but trial enrollment was&#xD;
      terminated on 21 February 2020 after 159 patients were enrolled, on the recommendation of the&#xD;
      DSMC following publication of the 65 trial. Six-month follow-up will be complete in August&#xD;
      2020. The statistical analysis plan will be registered and published before analyzing the&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
