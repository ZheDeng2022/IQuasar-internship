  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, Phase Ib/IIa study designed to evaluate the safety, toxicity and&#xD;
      biological activity of high dose Vitamin C in bone marrow and peripheral blood when&#xD;
      administered as therapy to patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
      according to the revised IPSS (international prognostic scoring system) criteria whose&#xD;
      disease has a Ten-eleven translocation-2, (TET2) mutation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will enroll patients with intermediate or high risk myelodysplastic syndrome. All&#xD;
      patients will receive at least 1 cycle of treatment (4 weeks). Patients with clinical benefit&#xD;
      (CR,PR, or SD) then will undergo a second 4-week cycle of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the safety and toxicity of high dose Vitamin C&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Estimate the proportion of Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients with Ten-eleven&#xD;
           translocation-2, (TET2) mutations who exhibit a biological response defined as maintaing&#xD;
           a vtamin C serum concentration of ≥1mM over the treatment cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Estimate the clinical efficacy, namely objectiveresponse rate (ORR). [including complete&#xD;
           response (CR) and partial response (PR)] duration of response (DOR) and progression-free&#xD;
           survival (PFS) as defined in the IWG (International Working Group) response criteria in&#xD;
           myelodisplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluate the pharmacokinetic profile (PK) of Vitamin C as hypomethylating or&#xD;
           demethylating agent&#xD;

If anion gap is elevated (&gt;11mEq/L) then we will hold the study drug for one week and recheck anion gap. If still elevated (&gt;11mEq/L), we will withdraw the patient from the study, If not elevated (≤11mEq/L) we will resume vitamin C treatment.</description>
