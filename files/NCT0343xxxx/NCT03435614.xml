  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mechanically ventilated critically ill adults may require prolonged administration of opioids&#xD;
      to facilitate ventilator support and maintain comfort. The prolonged use has been associated&#xD;
      with withdrawal symptoms upon rapid weaning in critically ill patients, known as the&#xD;
      opioid-associated withdrawal syndrome (OIWS). Such withdrawal symptoms are well described in&#xD;
      the paediatric population, however there is a lack of information in the adult population.&#xD;
      Currently there is no bedside tool to rapidly identify such patients. Recognition of&#xD;
      withdrawal symptoms is the basis for the development of an assessment tool to identify&#xD;
      patients with OIWS.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To identify specific signs and symptoms of OIWS in mechanically ventilated adult&#xD;
           intensive care unit (ICU) patients receiving at least 72 hours of regular opioids at the&#xD;
           Montreal General Hospital (MGH) and the Royal Victoria Hospital (RVH) from February to&#xD;
           October 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine if a change in serum cortisol is associated with the presence of OIWS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Considering our first objective is purely descriptive, no hypothesis can be stated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. OIWS is associated with an increase in serum cortisol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective multicentre observational study will be carried out in two&#xD;
      university-affiliated hospital ICUs (Montreal General Hospital and Royal Victoria Hospital).&#xD;
      All mechanically ventilated adult ICU patients receiving regular (continuous or intermittent)&#xD;
      opioids for more than 72 hours will be prospectively screened daily for withdrawal symptoms&#xD;
      once the opioid dose is reduced by 10% or more. From that moment, daily evaluation by a&#xD;
      physician using the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders-5 (DSM-5) criteria&#xD;
      for opioid withdrawal will be conducted. Concomitantly, signs and symptoms of withdrawal will&#xD;
      be collected by an investigator blinded to the DSM-5 assessment. These assessments will&#xD;
      continue daily until the patient is transferred out of ICU or a maximum of 14 days and will&#xD;
      be repeated once more between day 1 and day 4 post-transfer out of ICU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serum cortisol will be drawn on the first day of dose reduction by 10% or more (baseline)&#xD;
      and will be repeated either after 72 hours or upon patient discharge from the ICU, whichever&#xD;
      one occurs first.&#xD;

These assessments were performed once daily.&#xD;
Note that for the group of patients experiencing IWS, the data on signs and symptoms are limited to the assessment on the day that patients experienced OIWS.&#xD;
The signs and symptoms presented (Restlessness; Agitation; Anxiety, Hallucinations, Insomnia/sleep disturbance; mydriasis; SBP &gt; 140) were selected based on a &gt; 15 % absolute difference between both groups which was judged to be clinically significant.</description>

          <description>Mechanically ventilated critically ill adults receiving regular opioids for more than 72 hours will be prospectively followed for the emergence of withdrawal symptoms upon weaning of opioids.&#xD;
Opioids: Once an opioid dose reduction of 10% or greater is achieved, a daily assessment will be conducted by a physician using the DSM-5 criteria for opioid withdrawal. In addition, signs and symptoms of withdrawal will be collected daily by a blinded investigator.</description>
