  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Live Donor Champion Program is a clinical education program offered to patients placed on&#xD;
      the waitlist for kidney transplantation at the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center.&#xD;
      The goal of the program is to increase patient knowledge regarding end stage renal disease,&#xD;
      kidney transplantation, and live kidney donation and to help patients identify potential live&#xD;
      kidney donors. Patients are encouraged to bring family and friends to participate in the&#xD;
      program and act as advocates on their behalf. These friends and family members are labeled&#xD;
      &quot;live donor champions&quot; and work to assist the patient in spreading awareness about end stage&#xD;
      renal disease, kidney transplantation, and live kidney donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this project are to pilot-test and optimize strategies for the&#xD;
      dissemination of the Live Donor Champion program in the clinical transplant center setting.&#xD;
      The goals of the study are to develop an implementation protocol for centers who want to&#xD;
      establish a live donor champion program at their institution.&#xD;

      Live Donor Champion Concept: Even with adequate education of live donation, many kidney&#xD;
      transplant candidates still feel ill equipped to ask others to consider donating. Friends and&#xD;
      family are often eager to help and may not be able to serve as donors themselves, but might&#xD;
      be able to provide substantial instrumental support. A &quot;Live Donor Champion&quot; (LDC) is a&#xD;
      friend, family member, or community member who serves as an advocate for the candidate in&#xD;
      their pursuit of live donation. The Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Transplant Center has&#xD;
      developed a six-month program that provides education and advocacy training to waitlist&#xD;
      candidates and their LDCs. The instrumental support provided by the LDC bridges a critical&#xD;
      link between education and action. In pilot studies, candidates with an LDC were more likely&#xD;
      to undergo Live Donor Kidney Transplant (LDKT) than matched controls. Using LDCs to increase&#xD;
      live donation is a novel approach that has garnered widespread enthusiasm, including support&#xD;
      from United Network for Organ Sharing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Live Donor Champions (LDCs) as Instrumental Support for Transplant Candidates. Approaching&#xD;
      potential donors is a daunting and overwhelming experience for Kidney Transplant (KT)&#xD;
      candidates. Current educational programs address the medical aspects of dialysis, KT, and&#xD;
      donation, but neglect the health communication skills to discuss transplantation and to&#xD;
      spread awareness through their various social networks. While transplant candidates are&#xD;
      hesitant to engage others in conversations about End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) and live&#xD;
      donation, friends, family members, or community members are eager to spread awareness and&#xD;
      provide advocacy for the patient. In pilot studies, this intervention improved knowledge&#xD;
      regarding LDKT and provided instrumental support to the transplant candidates. Understanding&#xD;
      what factors are associated with the successful implementation of this program will enable&#xD;
      its eventual dissemination at transplant centers nationwide ultimately improving nationwide&#xD;
      education and awareness of LDKT. In order to successfully do so, a scientifically rigorous&#xD;
      implementation study is necessary.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Adoption - Implementation Outcome</measure>
    <time_frame>within 2 years of enrollment</time_frame>
    <description>Adoption is defined as the intention or action to employ an innovation or practice. Adoption will be measured qualitatively using an adapted Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) instrument.

    <description>The Live Donor Champion program is the sole educational intervention for this trial. LDC consists of 6 monthly sessions of approx. 1 hour each. Each LDC session is led by a transplant physician or clinical coordinator. LDC sessions incorporate formal didactics, active-participant learning, personal stories, moderated group discussions, role-playing, and other skill-building exercises. LDC sessions are as follows: 1) education about ESRD, KT, and LDKT 2) communication skills building 3) Exploring social networks 4) sharing successful donor and recipient stories 5) encouraging candidate self-efficacy 6) Program Recap.</description>
