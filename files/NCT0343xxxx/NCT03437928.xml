  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the study is to address the unmet need of TRD patients by identifying brain&#xD;
      networks critical for treating depression and to use next generation precision DBS with&#xD;
      steering capability to engage these targeted networks. The study's goal will be achieved&#xD;
      through 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate device capability to selectively and predictably engage distinct brain&#xD;
           networks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Delineate depression-relevant networks and demonstrate behavioral changes with&#xD;
           network-targeted stimulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Demonstrate that chronic DBS using steered, individualized targeting is feasible and&#xD;
           safe for reducing depressive symptoms&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a major worldwide burden. Major depression has a&#xD;
      lifetime prevalence of ~15% across developed countries. Up to a third of patients fail to&#xD;
      respond adequately to evidence-based treatments, including pharmacological, behavioral, and&#xD;
      electroconvulsive therapy. The investigators employ an innovative approach, including&#xD;
      subacute invasive neurophysiological monitoring with which they aim to gain insight into the&#xD;
      networks underlying depression symptomatology, confirm the ability to predict the effects of&#xD;
      precision DBS on network activity, and harmonize these insights to implement network-guided&#xD;
      DBS for TRD.&#xD;

             SCID-5) of major depression disorder (MDD) as the primary diagnosis. A current major&#xD;
             depressive episode (MDE), recurrent or single episode with first episode before age&#xD;
             60, secondary to nonpsychotic unipolar major depressive disorder;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Chronic illness with current MDE ≥24 months duration and/or recurrent illness with at&#xD;
             least a total of 2 lifetime episodes (including current episode &gt;12 months);&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Treatment resistance (defined by criteria on the Antidepressant Treatment History Form&#xD;
             ATHF): Failure (i.e. persistence of the major depressive episode) to respond to a&#xD;
             minimum of four adequate depression treatments from at least two different treatment&#xD;
             categories (e.g. SSRIs, SNRIs, TCAs, other antidepressants, lithium-addition,&#xD;
             irreversible MAOIs, antidepressant augmentation with an atypical antipsychotic&#xD;
             medication);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Previous trial of Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) (lifetime): either did not respond,&#xD;
             relapsed, poorly tolerated or refused. If refused, will discuss reasons and ensure&#xD;
             subject understands relative risks of ECT versus DBS. We will try to enrich sample&#xD;
             with patients who had previously shown response to ECT (or another intervention) that&#xD;
             was partial or un-sustained;&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. The HDRS17 must remain greater than or equal to 20 on two separate assessments (at&#xD;
