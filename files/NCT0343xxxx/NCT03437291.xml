      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare between the role of Transabdominal ultrasound versus Transvaginal ultrasound in&#xD;
      evaluation of placental invasion in cases of placenta previa anterior wall with previous&#xD;
      uterine scar applying the unified ultrasonographic descriptors suggested by the European&#xD;
      working group on abnormally invasive placenta &quot;EW-AIP' Also to evaluate the sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity of each criterion by comparing them with the final outcome of pregnancy Fifty&#xD;
      pregnant women with persistent placenta previa (after 28 weeks' gestation) were prospectively&#xD;
      enrolled into this study. Both transabdominal and transvaginal ultrasound were performed by&#xD;
      two different operators who were blinded to the results of each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      the placenta was studied as regarding the exact loacalization and the unified descriptors&#xD;
      were applied and evaluated by TAS and TVS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultrasound findings were analyzed with reference to the final diagnosis made during&#xD;
      Cesarean delivery and histopathological examination&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Definitive diagnosis of Abnormally Invasive Placenta was made at delivery when the myometrium&#xD;
      was seen to be invaded by the placenta, and the pathological examination of the removed&#xD;
      uterus showed the villi attached to the myometrium without intervening decidua (accreta),&#xD;
      invading into the myometrium (increta) or reaching the serosa (percreta).&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Complete imaging using all diagnostic techniques (gray-scale, color Doppler) by both&#xD;
      transabdominal and transvaginal by two expert operators, then an offline analysis of the&#xD;
      acquired images &amp; volumes was done Ultrasound examination was performed using a 2D ultrasound&#xD;
      system equipped with a 4-8-MHz trans-abdominal transducer and a 12 MHz transvaginal&#xD;
      transducer The transvaginal ultrasound was performed by a highly experienced operator whereas&#xD;
      the transabdominal ultrasound was performed by a less experienced one and both were blinded&#xD;
      from the results of each other Placenta was examined while the bladder was partially full&#xD;
      about 300 ml for adequate visualization and precise localization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Examined placenta is considered to be suspicious of abnormal invasion in case of having&#xD;
      one or more of the unified descriptors described by the European working Group on Abnormally&#xD;
      Invasive Placenta &quot;EW-AIP&quot;:&#xD;
