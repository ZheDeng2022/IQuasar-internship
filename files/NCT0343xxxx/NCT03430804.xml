      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is prospective study, comparative clinical trial for a test against a gold&#xD;
      standard with blinding of the evaluator&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study setting:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be carried out in Ain-Shams university maternity hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients recruited were given an oral consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients were subjected to the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      History of the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Detailed and careful history was taken from the patient as the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Personal history: name, age, occupation, residence and special habit of medical&#xD;
                importance.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Obstetric history: including last menstrual period, Gestation age and regular&#xD;
                Antenatal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Past history: including any medical disorder e.g. Diabetes mellitus, hypertension&#xD;
                or any surgical procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. History of present pregnancy: duration of pregnancy from last menstrual period, any&#xD;
                complications occurred or any medication used during pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Examination of the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. General examination: as regard level of consciousness, vital data, and complexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Abdominal examination: as regard fundal level, lie of the fetus, detection of any&#xD;
                uterine contractions and fetal heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Pelvic Examination: as regard pelvic capacity, presenting part, presence of rupture&#xD;
                of membranes and cervical assessment as regard cervical dilation, station and&#xD;
                presenting part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigations. Complete blood count , Rh, transvaginal ultra sound and non-stress test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients had vaginal examination for assessing the (Bishop Score,1964) before&#xD;
           induction of labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All women had transvaginal ultrasound for assessment of cervical length using (median&#xD;
           digital GAIA) Ultrasonic machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol of transvaginal ultrasound will be done as follow:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient will be asked to void.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vaginal probe will be inserted using direct visualization with K-Y gel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Identification of bladder, amniotic fluid and fetal presenting part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Identification of abnormal findings as placenta pervia or absence of fetal heart motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Identification of midline sagittal plane of the cervix and looking in the proximal one&#xD;
           third of the image for the internal os then pulling back the probe until the lightest&#xD;
           touch provides good image of the cervical canal and moving the probe slightly to get the&#xD;
           best long axis of the cervix then measuring the cervical length by placing the calipers&#xD;
           appropriately and recording the distance between internal and external cervical os.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Transvaginal ultrasound will be done to assess cervical length using medison&#xD;
                sonoace 8800 (median digital GAIA) ultrasound machine equipped with a 7.5 m hertz&#xD;
                by vaginal probe in Ain-Shams University Maternity Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Induction of labour will be done using intravaginal misoprostol (25 microgram) then&#xD;
                digital examination will be made 6 h after the first intravaginal administration;&#xD;
                if necessary, 3 doses were given at 6 hours interval. External Cardiotocography&#xD;
                will be regularly performed to monitor the condition of the fetus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Continuous Cardiotocography will be used in all cases. If necessary, amniotomy will&#xD;
                be performed. Intravenous oxytocin administration will be started when there is an&#xD;
                arrest of dilatation, starting at 1milli-international unit/minute and increasing 1&#xD;
                mIU every 30 min as necessary. For analgesia, intramuscular pethidine will be&#xD;
                offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Caesarean delivery will be done due to pathological fetal heart rate trace, arrest&#xD;
                the fetal head for at least one hour despite adequate uterine contractions.&#xD;

    <description>median Bishop score assessed by digital vaginal examination as follows: Cervical dilatation in centimeters will be given a score of zero if closed, a score of 1 if 1-2 cm dilated, a score of 2 if 3-4 cm dilated and a score of 3 if 5 cm or more dilatation.&#xD;
Effacement of the cervix will be given a score of zero if 0-30%, a score of 1 if 40-50%, a score of 2 if 60-70% and a score of 3 if 80% or more.&#xD;
Station of fetal head will be given a score of zero if -3, a score of 1 if -2, a score of 2 if -1 to zero and a score of 3 if 1 or more.&#xD;
Consistency of the cervix will be given a score of zero if firm, a score of 1 if medium and a score of 2 if soft.&#xD;
Position of the cervix will be given a score of zero if posterior, a score of 1 if mid position and a score of 2 if anterior. So, a total score (sum of all scores) of zero at a minimum to 10 at a maximum can be estimated.&#xD;
Note that a score more than 10 means patient is in labor not needing induction of labor.</description>
