      This is a study to pilot the feasibility of using a novel patient-led, smartphone-based&#xD;
      mobile health platform (Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes of patients after they&#xD;
      undergo a bariatric surgical procedure (either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) and&#xD;
      catheter-based atrial fibrillation ablation&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The plan is to pilot test a novel patient-led, smartphone-based mobile health platform&#xD;
      (called Hugo) for real-world surveillance of outcomes in 60 total patients after medical&#xD;
      device use. Research associates will be recruiting patients before they undergo a bariatric&#xD;
      surgical procedure (either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass) and catheter-based atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation ablation. Patients will then be queried about specific symptoms related to their&#xD;
      procedure. Patients will also be given syncable devices to use that will provide additional&#xD;
      insights into their health and health outcomes. This pilot project will engage patients to&#xD;
      report outcomes while also synchronizing data from their electronic health records and&#xD;
      pharmacy accounts to ascertain the ability of emerging mobile health technologies to aid in&#xD;
      post-marketing surveillance.&#xD;

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Disease-specific PROMs were collected using email notification to all patients over the course of the study. Disease-specific PROMs were emailed to patients at enrollment (preprocedure) and 1, 4, and 8 weeks post-procedure and were tailored to patients depending on the procedure they received. For each PROM, the date and time that it was emailed to patients, the time it was initiated, and the time at which the final response was received were all available.</description>

    <measure>Number of Post-Procedure PROMs Completed</measure>
    <time_frame>5 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Post-procedure PROMs were collected using email notification to all patients over the course of the study. Post-procedure PROMs were emailed to patients twice weekly for a total of 5 weeks post-procedure. Bariatric surgery patients were asked two questions: (1) if they had pain (yes/no) and, if yes, to rate their pain on a scale of 1-10 and (2) if they had an appetite (yes/no) and, if yes, to rate their appetite on a scale of 1-10. Atrial fibrillation ablation patients were asked about pain, as well as whether they had palpitations and, if yes, to rate both symptoms on a scale of 1-10. For each PROM, the date and time that it was emailed to patients, the time it was initiated, and the time at which the final response was received were all available.</description>

    <time_frame>8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>For EHR data, we validated the following components over 8 weeks follow-up: encounter date, encounter type, and encounter primary diagnosis. Specifically, we determined if encounters aggregated by the patient-centered health data sharing platform, Hugo, matched encounters listed in each patient's EHR.</description>

        A patient's eligibility will first be determined by the implanting physician who will be&#xD;
        performing the catheter-based atrial fibrillation ablation or bariatric surgical procedure&#xD;
        (either sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass). The criterion used will simply be the&#xD;
        cardiac electrophysiologist stating that the patient is being seen pre-procedurally for&#xD;
        catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation or the bariatric surgeon stating that the patient&#xD;
        is being seen pre-operatively for sleeve gastrectomy or gastric bypass.&#xD;

    <limitations_and_caveats>Enrolled a small number of patients (60) for a relatively short follow-up duration (8 weeks); EHR data for 5 patients were not observable in Hugo due to sync failure after portals were locked out from multiple incorrect password entries or an EHR upgrade; Stipends were provided to cover time and effort involved with study enrollment and participation and free personal digital devices, both of which may have enhanced engagement over the follow-up period; Did not examine quality of data obtained</limitations_and_caveats>
