      Emergency room patients referred for esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) often have many&#xD;
      possible causes for their symptoms. These inevitably undergo further testing if EGD is&#xD;
      inconclusive, which adds costs and inevitably prolongs emergency room length of stay&#xD;
      (LOS).EUS has traditionally been used after EGD for a myriad of costs reasons that no longer&#xD;
      apply. We therefore propose a prospective pilot study to determine whether PEUS can reduce&#xD;
      LOS and resource utilisation in emergency room patients referred for EGD.&#xD;

      A PILOT STUDY TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL VALUE OF ADDING ENDOSCOPIC ULTRASOUND (EUS) TO&#xD;
      ESOPHAGO-GASTRO-DUODENOSCOPY (EGD) IN EMERGENCY ROOM PATIENTS REFERRED FOR EGD&#xD;
&#xD;
      P.I.: Anand V. Sahai MD, MSc (EPID), FRCPC&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND Emergency room patients referred for esophago-gastro-duodenoscopy (EGD) often have&#xD;
      many possible causes for their symptoms. These inevitably undergo further testing if EGD is&#xD;
      inconclusive, which adds costs and inevitably prolongs emergency room length of stay (LOS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) combines EGD with high-resolution ultrasound imaging of pancreas,&#xD;
      liver and biliary system and is the best test to diagnose bile duct stones, early chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis, and small [&lt;2cm] pancreatic cancers (all of which cannot be seen by regular&#xD;
      ultrasound or CT scanning or MRI, yet are included in the differential diagnosis of&#xD;
      EGD-negative abdominal pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUS has traditionally been used after EGD, due to lack of availability, increased cost, and&#xD;
      to increased risk due to larger scope diameter. However, the latest generation of EUS scopes&#xD;
      have the same outer diameter as conventional gastroscopes, there is much wider availability&#xD;
      of EUS in university and community hospital settings, and the cost per procedure is lower,&#xD;
      due to increased procedural numbers and reduced maintenance costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In experienced hands, diagnostic EUS is now as safe and as EGD accurate as EGD for diagnosing&#xD;
      mucosal pathology and takes approximately 1 minute longer.(1; 2) Previously published work by&#xD;
      our group suggests that EUS may reduce resource consumption in patients with unexplained&#xD;
      abdominal pain.(3) The investigators also showed that refractory dyspepsia with normal EGD&#xD;
      and CT, EUS identified signs of occult chronic pancreatitis in up to 20% of cases.(4) More&#xD;
      recently, EUS was found to identify previously undiagnosed, potential causes of unexplained&#xD;
      abdominal pain in up to 9% of patients, or at least provides the same, if not more&#xD;
      information and EGD and abdominal US alone.(2; 5; 6) There are no previous studies that have&#xD;
      prospectively compared the yield of EGD and PEUS in emergency room patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that adding EUS to EGD (&quot;primary EUS&quot; [PEUS]) can safely and more&#xD;
      efficiently diagnose or exclude significant gastro-intestinal and pancreatico-biliary&#xD;
      pathology in emergency room patients in whom EGD has been requested. The investigators&#xD;
      therefore propose a prospective pilot study to determine whether PEUS can reduce LOS and&#xD;
      resource utilisation in emergency room patients referred for EGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM To perform a pilot study to determine whether PEUS reduces emergency room LOS and&#xD;
      resource utilisation in emergency room patients referred for EGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design This is an open-label two-arm, single center, superiority trial with 1:1&#xD;
      allocation ratio between EUS and standard intervention EGD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Site&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be performed at the St Luc site of CHUM. Approximately 5000 EGD procedures&#xD;
      and 3000 EUS procedures are performed at this site annually. Therefore, there should be&#xD;
      sufficient eligible patients for efficient patient recruitment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research team A research team composed of the PI, one research nurse, and a biostatistician&#xD;
      will coordinate the trial. The research assistant will be responsible for all data collection&#xD;
      and patient recruitment (including consent). Statistical analysis will be provided by the&#xD;
      biostatistical platform of the CR-CHUM under the supervision of Dr Martin Ladouceur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding There is no external funding for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient selection All patients referred for GI consultation in the emergency room at CHUM,&#xD;
      site St Luc, are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria EGD requested by the consulting gastroenterologist Informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria Evidence of hemodynamic instability and/or ongoing active GI bleeding. Any&#xD;
      suspicion of obstruction distal to the angle of Treitz. EGD or EUS cannot be performed before&#xD;
      12PM. Previous barium study, EGD, US, abdomino-pelvic CT, or abdomino-pelvic MRI within the&#xD;
      last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the EGD request form is received in the GI department, the patient will be transported&#xD;
      as usual to the endoscopy unit. Before entering an endoscopy suite, a single research&#xD;
      assistant will present the patients the study protocol. After informed consent, each group&#xD;
      will be randomized by sealed envelop to EGD or to PEUS. A gastroenterologist other than the&#xD;
      one who requested EGD will perform EGD or EUS. Written EGD and PEUS reports will be presented&#xD;
      in the standard fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGD and EUS are both available every day, before 12PM. They will be performed and interpreted&#xD;
      by experienced operators (not fellows).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOMES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in whom EGD is scheduled after GI consultation will be stratified in to 2 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. abdominal pain syndromes (defined as any pain or discomfort considered to be possibly of&#xD;
           GI origin)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. all other indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome The primary outcome will be &quot;time to GI diagnosis&quot; (with T0 starting&#xD;
      immediately after the procedure report is read and signed by the referring physician). A &quot;GI&#xD;
      diagnosis&quot; is defined as diagnosis or confirmation of any condition sufficient to start&#xD;
      treatment or to modify the existing therapeutic regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
      frequency of conversion to the alternate procedure (EGD to EUS, or EUS to EGD) number of&#xD;
      subsequent imaging procedures other than endoscopy complications (defined as any event that&#xD;
      prolongs hospital stay)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE CALCULATIONS Given the novelty of the primary outcome of this study (&quot;time to&#xD;
      diagnosis, discharge, or admission&quot;), there are no reliable data on which a sample-size&#xD;
      estimate can be calculated. The investigators propose a pilot approach, with 40 patients per&#xD;
      randomisation group (80 patients in total). This would be followed by an analysis to further&#xD;
      clarify the appropriate sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4 Expected Duration of Study Given our current patient volumes, the investigatorsshould be&#xD;
      able to recruit 1 person per day (5 per week). This should require approximately 16 weeks (4&#xD;
      months) to complete this pilot project. Given that the primary endpoint is likely to occur in&#xD;
      less than 3-4 days, the entire study duration until complete follow of the last patient would&#xD;
      be approximately 17 weeks. To be conservative, and allow for unexpected contingencies, we&#xD;
      propose an estimate for pilot study duration of 8 months.&#xD;
