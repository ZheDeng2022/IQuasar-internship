    <description>OS is defined as the time from the date of first dose of study treatment to the date of death from any cause. Participants who are lost to follow-up are censored at the last date the participant was known to be alive, and participants who remain alive are censored at the time of data cutoff.

    <description>PFS based on modified Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (mRECIST) (and including the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 conventions for non-hepatic lesions) is defined as the time from the date of the first dose of first-line lenvatinib treatment to the date of the first documentation of PD, or the date of death during the subsequent systemic TPC, whichever occurs first. PD is defined at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter [mm]) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions. PFS was to be calculated using Kaplan-Meier estimate and presented with 2-sided 95% confidence interval.</description>

PD is defined at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 mm) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.

PD is defined at least 20% increase (including an absolute increase of at least 5 millimeter [mm]) in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum and/or unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and/or appearance of 1 or more new lesions.
