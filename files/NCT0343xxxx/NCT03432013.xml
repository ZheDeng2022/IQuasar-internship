  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence suggests that it is not the negative affect per se but underlying&#xD;
      maladaptive cognitive, behavioral, and emotional responses to it that put an individual at&#xD;
      risk of pathological substance use. Maladaptive reactivity to negative affect may account for&#xD;
      the association between substance-use and emotional disorders and may contribute to poor&#xD;
      treatment outcomes for Substance Use Disorder. Thus, teaching adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      (herein referred to as &quot;adolescents&quot;) skills to manage negative affect may improve&#xD;
      therapeutic outcomes of treatment for substance use disorder. Cannabis-use disorder (CUD)&#xD;
      among adolescents is a prevalent and growing public health concern. Maladaptive reactivity to&#xD;
      negative affect contributes to the maintenance of CUD and accounts for the associations&#xD;
      between symptoms of emotional disorders and cannabis use. Still, maladaptive reactivity to&#xD;
      negative affect has not yet been targeted in an intervention for CUD. Thus, the overarching&#xD;
      aim of this proposal is to develop and pilot test a treatment for CUD that emphasizes the&#xD;
      reduction of maladaptive responding to negative affect in adolescents. Participants will be&#xD;
      placed in either a standard cognitive behavioral therapy for CUD, or the proposed affective&#xD;
      management therapy. The investigators hypothesize that affective management training will&#xD;
      yield greater reductions in the participants' use of cannabis, as well as greater&#xD;
      improvements to the participants' negative thoughts and emotions, compared to the standard&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy.&#xD;

      This project aims to develop and evaluate a behavioral intervention for adolescent cannabis&#xD;
      use disorder that emphasizes adaptive responding to negative affective symptoms (e.g.,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety). Maladaptive cognitive, behavioral, and emotional reactions to negative&#xD;
      affect are associated with substance use and substance use problems (including cannabis).&#xD;
      Adolescence and young adulthood represents a developmental period in which the regulation of&#xD;
      negative emotions is still being developed, as well as a time when cannabis use is prevalent&#xD;
      and cannabis use disorders onset. Thus, developing and evaluating cannabis use disorder&#xD;
      interventions that emphasize the improvement of responding to negative affect may be&#xD;
      particularly important for this developmental period. First, the investigators developed an&#xD;
      intervention that weaves skills and strategies for responding adaptively to negative affect,&#xD;
      particularly as it relates to high-risk times for cannabis craving and use, into an&#xD;
      evidence-based substance use disorder intervention for individuals in late adolescence and&#xD;
      early adulthood. After delivering it to a small sample of participants, the investigators&#xD;
      will gather feedback to guide refinements to the intervention. After refining the&#xD;
      intervention, which will be a 12-session individual treatment, we will conduct the pilot&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial. Participants (N = 80) aged 18-25 with cannabis use disorder and&#xD;
      elevations in constructs representing maladaptive reactivity to negative affect (i.e., high&#xD;
      anxiety sensitivity, low distress tolerance, or facets of emotion dysregulation including&#xD;
      high emotional suppression and low cognitive reappraisal ability) will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive either: (a) standard cognitive behavioral therapy for adolescent substance use&#xD;
      disorders (SUD-CBT) or (b) the novel intervention we develop, affective management training&#xD;
      for cannabis use disorders (CUD-AMT). Participants will be assessed at baseline,&#xD;
      post-treatment, and a 6-month follow-up assessment on self-report and behavioral indices of&#xD;
      the targeted mechanisms, as well as on substance use outcomes (both cannabis-specific and&#xD;
      substances more broadly defined). A sub-set of participants (n = 50) will also undergo pre-&#xD;
      and post-treatment fMRI assessment to evaluate whether neural indices of emotion regulation&#xD;
      are improved to a greater extent in CUD-AMT compared to SUD-CBT. Cannabis use disorder is the&#xD;
      most prevalent substance use disorder among adolescents and young adults, and often leads to&#xD;
      the use of other substances. Negative affect and disorders associated with high negative&#xD;
      affect (i.e., anxiety and unipolar mood disorders) are highly prevalent and associated with&#xD;
      significant substance use disorder comorbidity. Targeting a process that is still malleable&#xD;
      in late adolescence and young adulthood and that is associated with the maintenance of&#xD;
      substance use disorders has the potential to reduce the burden of substance use disorders in&#xD;
      this population, thus making a significant public health impact.&#xD;
