    <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The patient's total NIHSS score ranges from 0 (minimum) - 42 (maximum). Score 0 (no stroke symptoms); 1 - 4 (Minor stroke); 5-15 (Moderate stroke); 16-20 (Moderate to severe stroke); and 21-42 (Severe stroke).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With NIHSS Scores</title>
        <description>The National Institutes of Health Stroke Scale, or NIH Stroke Scale (NIHSS) is a tool used to objectively quantify the impairment caused by a stroke. The NIHSS is composed of 11 items, each of which scores a specific ability between 0 and 4. For each item, a score of 0 typically indicates normal function in that specific ability, while a higher score is indicative of some level of impairment. The individual scores from each item are summed to calculate a patient's total NIHSS score. The patient's total NIHSS score ranges from 0 (minimum) - 42 (maximum). Score 0 (no stroke symptoms); 1 - 4 (Minor stroke); 5-15 (Moderate stroke); 16-20 (Moderate to severe stroke); and 21-42 (Severe stroke).</description>
