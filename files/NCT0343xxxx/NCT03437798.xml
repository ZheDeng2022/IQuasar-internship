  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite significant improvement in treating periodontal disease (PD) and the identification&#xD;
      of multiple risk factors, little is known about the specific contribution of genetics to PD&#xD;
      pathogenesis. Several genomewide association studies (GWAS) of PD have been published, but&#xD;
      only one reported locus has reached the threshold for genome-wide significance.&#xD;
      Epidemiological studies and biological experiments established associations and suggested&#xD;
      common pathogenetic pathways between PD and cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes (DM), and&#xD;
      osteoporosis. The overall objective is to identify genetic loci for PD as a first step toward&#xD;
      a better understanding of PD pathogenesis. In a preliminary study in the Women's Genome&#xD;
      Health Study (WGHS), new-onset cases of PD were associated with a family history of&#xD;
      myocardial infarction (MI). Further preliminary analyses presented shared phenotypic&#xD;
      variation of PD/CVD, PD/DM, or PD/osteoporosis that could be accounted by the whole-genome&#xD;
      genetic matrices. Several variants from the GWAS catalog of bone density and family history&#xD;
      of MI were found correlated with PD in the WGHS. Based on these findings and the literature,&#xD;
      the central hypothesis is that there are common pathogenetic links between PD and these other&#xD;
      diseases and that GWAS using the comorbidity case definitions will help identify potential&#xD;
      common loci.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Three specific aims are proposed to refine and validate the PD status in the Women's Health&#xD;
      Study (WHS/WGHS) to improve the phenotypic characterization of GWAS of PD: (1) Addition of&#xD;
      CDC-AAP (Centers for Disease Control - American Academy of Periodontology) periodontal&#xD;
      disease instrument to the WHS annual follow-up survey. (2) Validate existing Periodontal&#xD;
      Disease (PD) status in the WHS/WGHS (subset). Request of dental records for 180 women sampled&#xD;
      from the WHS who had reported diagnosis of PD in the past. (3) Correlation and validation&#xD;
      analysis of new periodontal disease information with requested dental record (most recently&#xD;
      dated). Phone interviews and request of dental records for 180 women sampled from the&#xD;
      WHS/WGHS who visited a dentist within recent 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the investigators propose to identify genetic determinants of PD shared with&#xD;
      CVD, DM, or osteoporosis via an integrative computational biological networks approach.&#xD;
      Although the systemic links between PD vs. DM, CVD or osteoporosis have been established in&#xD;
      clinical genetics as well as in experimental models, high-throughput investigations for&#xD;
      gene-gene interplays between the associated conditions (CVD vs. PD; DM vs. PD; osteoporosis&#xD;
      vs. PD) have not been explored yet. The investigators propose to approach this using an&#xD;
      integrative in silico method, combining existing diverse biological information including&#xD;
      genomic, epigenetic, expression and protein data. To our knowledge, this is the first time&#xD;
      that hierarchical levels of integrative precision medicine will be tested for PD vs.&#xD;
      CVD/DM/osteoporosis to generate plausible hypotheses and experimental targets.&#xD;
