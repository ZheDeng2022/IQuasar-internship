        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented diagnosis of DMD (severe dystrophinopathy) and clinical features consistent&#xD;
             of typical DMD at diagnosis (i.e., documented delayed motor skills and muscle weakness&#xD;
             by age 5 years) and who in the opinion of the Treating physician would benefit from&#xD;
             treatment with idebenone. DMD should be confirmed by mutation analysis in the&#xD;
             dystrophin gene or by substantially reduced levels of dystrophin protein (i.e., absent&#xD;
             or &lt;5% of normal) on Western blot or immunostaining.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Minimum 8 years old at Prescreening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PEF or FVC â‰¤80% and &gt;25% of predicted value based on most recent assessment noted in&#xD;
             the patient's medical record and subsequently confirmed at the Enrollment Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to understand program requirements and swallow program medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed and dated Informed Consent Form (to be obtained at the Enrollment Visit from&#xD;
             patient or parent/legal guardian (if applicable) prior to performing any&#xD;
             program-specific procedures and dispensing idebenone to the patient).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eligible for and able to participate in an ongoing clinical trial of idebenone.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is at high-risk of a fatal outcome from lung infection and/or advanced cardiomyopathy&#xD;
             in the opinion of the Treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known moderate or severe impairment of hepatic function or severe impairment of renal&#xD;
             function.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior or ongoing medical condition or laboratory abnormality which in the Treating&#xD;
             physician's opinion may put the patient at significant risk or may interfere&#xD;
             significantly with the patient's participation in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abuse of drugs or alcohol, which in Treating physician's opinion would interfere with&#xD;
             the compliance to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known individual hypersensitivity to idebenone or to any of the ingredients/excipients&#xD;
             of the program medication.&#xD;
