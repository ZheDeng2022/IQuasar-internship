    <textblock>
      To determine the clinical benefit rate of selumetinib in combination with sirolimus in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable or metastatic neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) associated or&#xD;
      sporadic MPNST.&#xD;

      I. Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the clinical benefit rate of selumetinib in combination with sirolimus in&#xD;
      patients with unresectable or metastatic NF1 associated or sporadic MPNST&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Secondary Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To define and describe the toxicities of selumetinib in combination with sirolimus in&#xD;
           patients with unresectable or metastatic NF1 associated or sporadic MPNST.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact on intensity and pain interference and correlate to changes in&#xD;
           clinical, imaging response and progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess progression free and overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selumetinib will be given orally 50mg twice daily continuously and sirolimus will be given&#xD;
      orally 4mg once daily with a cycle 1 day 1 loading dose of 12mg. One cycle will be 28 days.&#xD;
      Patients will be able to remain on treatment as long as they do not experience progressive&#xD;
      disease or unacceptable toxicity. Stage 1 will require 7 patients, with no further accrual if&#xD;
      0 of 7 respond. If 1 or greater of the 7 patients respond, accrual will continue until 21&#xD;
      patients have been enrolled.&#xD;

    <measure>Progression free and overall survival</measure>
    <time_frame>Progression-Free Survival (PFS) is defined as the duration of time from the start of treatment to the time of objective progression or death. [Time Frame: Up to 4 years]</time_frame>

    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>This study will use CTEP Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) Version 5.0 for toxicity and adverse event reporting. The toxicities will be graded and summarized descriptively and tabulations on the type, severity and relationship to study treatment will be performed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the impact on pain interference</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain interference metrics will be assessed using the Patient Reported Outcomes Measurements Information System (PROMIS) scale to assess the impact of pain on daily activities. This is a self-report measure that assesses the degree to which pain has interfered with the ability to complete daily activities over the past 7 days. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert scale and the measures yield standardized T-scores.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Assess the impact on pain severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Pain metrics will be assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale-11 (NRS-11) scale to assess pain severity. The scale consists of a horizontal line with 0 representing &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 representing &quot;worst pain you can imagine.&quot; Patients will circle one number from 0 to 10 that best describes how much their tumor pain hurt during the past week.</description>
