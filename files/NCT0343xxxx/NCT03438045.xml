      This feasibility and acceptability study will be conducted at 3 community outreach centers&#xD;
      serving an urban, low-income Chinese population. The study will evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of implementing a partnered intervention to improve the oral and general health&#xD;
      of low-income, urban Chinese American adults and of using remote data entry into an&#xD;
      electronic health record (EHR). The research staff will survey a sample of Chinese American&#xD;
      patients screened at each center about their satisfaction with the partnered intervention and&#xD;
      about their oral health behaviors. An additional sample selected from providers [dentists and&#xD;
      community health workers (CHW)], research staff, New York University (NYU) administrators,&#xD;
      site directors, and community advisory board (CAB) members will participate in structured&#xD;
      interviews about the partnered intervention. The remote EHR evaluation will include group&#xD;
      adaptation sessions and workflow analyses via multiple recorded sessions with research staff,&#xD;
      NYU administrators, outreach site directors, and providers (dentists and CHWs). The study&#xD;
      will also model knowledge held by these non-patient participants (including CAB members) to&#xD;
      evaluate and enhance the partnered intervention during and/or after the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability study for use in future implementations.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction: While the US health care system has the capability to provide amazing treatment&#xD;
      of a wide array of conditions, this care is not uniformly available to all population groups.&#xD;
      Oral health care is one of the dimensions of the US health care delivery system in which&#xD;
      striking disparities exist. More than half of the population does not visit a dentist each&#xD;
      year. Improving access to oral health care is a critical and necessary first step to&#xD;
      improving oral health outcomes and reducing disparities. Fluoride has contributed profoundly&#xD;
      to the improved dental health of populations worldwide and is needed regularly throughout the&#xD;
      life course to protect teeth against dental caries. To ensure additional gains in oral&#xD;
      health, fluoride toothpaste should be used routinely at all ages. Evidence-based guidelines&#xD;
      for annual dental visits and brushing teeth with fluoride toothpaste form the basis of this&#xD;
      implementation science project that is intended to bridge the care gap for underserved Asian&#xD;
      American populations by improving access to quality oral health care and enhancing effective&#xD;
      oral health promotion strategies. The ultimate goal of this study is to provide information&#xD;
      for the design and implementation of a randomized controlled trial of a participatory,&#xD;
      multi-level, partnered (i.e., with community stakeholders) intervention to improve the oral&#xD;
      and general health of low-income Chinese American adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of implementing a&#xD;
      partnered intervention using remote data entry into an electronic health record (EHR) to&#xD;
      improve access to oral health care and promote oral health. The research staff will survey a&#xD;
      sample of Chinese American patients (planned n = 90) screened at 3 outreach centers about&#xD;
      their satisfaction with the partnered intervention. Providers (dentists and community health&#xD;
      workers), research staff, administrators, site directors, and community advisory board&#xD;
      members will participate in structured interviews about the partnered intervention. The&#xD;
      remote EHR evaluation will include group adaptation sessions and workflow analyses via&#xD;
      multiple recorded sessions with research staff, administrators, outreach site directors, and&#xD;
      providers. The study will also model knowledge held by non-patient participants to evaluate&#xD;
      and enhance the partnered intervention for use in future implementations.&#xD;

            <description>The aspects of the partnering package of evidence-based intervention strategies are: (1) written agreements of collaboration for dental screening, health promotion, and incentives; (2) culturally-tailored and language-specific adaptation of materials; (3) demonstrations with role-playing of proper brushing with fluoride toothpaste and flossing techniques; and (4) CHW follow-up with patients of oral health care receipt and dental hygiene behaviors. Additionally, bilingual (English and Mandarin Chinese) CHWs will receive additional training in oral health promotion demonstration, oral health services and programs available at local clinics and hospitals, information about dental and health insurance, and evidence-based oral health behaviors.&#xD;
Partnered intervention: CHWs will provide dental education and counseling, lead interactive demonstrations of brushing with fluoride toothpaste and flossing, and improve access to dental care through dental coverage enrollment and linkage to local dentists.</description>

    <limitations_and_caveats>A limitation of this pilot study is the small sample size, especially for completion of the 1-month follow-up phone calls. As of March 2020, all research activities were halted at New York University (NYU) in New York, NY, USA, so we ended enrollment on the current pilot study and analyzed the data at hand. Additional limitations of this research include potential recall bias regarding the retrospective assessments, and possible response bias associated with self-reported behaviors.</limitations_and_caveats>
