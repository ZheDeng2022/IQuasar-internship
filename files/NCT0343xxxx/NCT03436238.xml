      The purpose of this multicentre, prospective, observational study is to identify robust&#xD;
      biochemical markers that predict adverse cardiovascular outcomes and mortality in patients&#xD;
      undergoing major abdominal surgery.&#xD;

      Inclusion Adults at least 50 years old undergoing elective, major or major/complex abdominal&#xD;
      surgery defined according to the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (www.sortsurgery.com), requiring&#xD;
      general anaesthesia and at least one overnight stay. Exclusion Patients with acute coronary&#xD;
      syndromes, new or decompensated heart failure at presentation, documented severeaortic&#xD;
      stenosis, severely reduced ejection fraction (&lt;40%) and inability to follow the procedures of&#xD;
      the study or lack of capacity to give informed consent. Transplantation, trauma, endocrine,&#xD;
      vascular and endovascular surgical procedures will also be excluded due to their distinct&#xD;
      risk profiles compared with the intended population. Outcome The composite endpoint is&#xD;
      all-cause mortality at 30 days and MACCE, the latter defined as nonfatal cardiac arrest,&#xD;
      acute MI, congestive heart failure, new cardiac arrhythmia, angina and stroke. Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints are 365-day all-cause mortality and MACCE. Data collection Relevant clinical and&#xD;
      peri-operative data for example comorbidities, RCRI, ASA-PS score, type and length of&#xD;
      surgery, blood loss and intra-operative lowest blood pressure will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma levels of hsTnT, NTproBNP, Copeptin, MR-proADM and CT-proET1 will be measured at five&#xD;
      sampling points: pre-operatively, immediately postoperatively, and on Days 1 to 3&#xD;
      postoperatively or until discharge. Data on MACCE will be obtained from patient records and&#xD;
      structured telephone interviews at 30 and 365 days by assessors blinded to the results of the&#xD;
      biomarker analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Based on an assumed incidence of MINS of 10%(1) and 365-day mortality in the&#xD;
      non-MINS group of 11% (estimate based on current data from the Swedish Perioperative&#xD;
      Registry), the required sample size to detect an effect size of 10% is 1142. To account for&#xD;
      drop-outs and missing data, we will recruit up to 1600 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Receiver operating curve analysis will be used to determine the optimal threshold of each&#xD;
      biomarker in predicting mortality/MACCE. The net reclassification index will be used to&#xD;
      assess if biomarkers confer added value to the RCRI for the classification of MACCE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A multivariable Cox proportional hazard models will be used to test the independent&#xD;
      prognostic value of biomarkers. The sample size allows for adjustment of the following&#xD;
      prespecified variables, selected on the basis of clinical plausibility and prior evidence:&#xD;
      age, sex, ASA-PS class, RCRI, Charlson Comorbidity Index, length and type of surgery,&#xD;
      presence of intra-operative hypotension, pre-operative creatinine and haemoglobin, biomarkers&#xD;
      (alone and in combination). An independent statistical analysis will be conducted after&#xD;
      recruitment of 600 patients to assess the frequency of outcomes and missing data, after which&#xD;
      the sample size may be adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: An independent assessment by the Data Safety and Monitoring Board (DSMB) specifically&#xD;
      addressing a revision of the sample size found that a total of 1269-1334 participants would&#xD;
      be required for the study. This was based on a lower than expected rate of missing data (7.6%&#xD;
      at DSMB assessment vs. expected 33% during study planning).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore revised the sample size to 1269 (-1334) participants on 2 September 2019.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients undergoing elective, major abdominal surgery*.&#xD;
&#xD;
        (*Major abdominal surgery requiring general anaesthesia, and requiring at least one&#xD;
        overnight stay. Major abdominal surgery is defined as those classified as major OR&#xD;
        major/complex by the Surgical Outcome Risk Tool (SORT) (www.sortsurgery.com).&#xD;
&#xD;
        In essence major surgery is one that penetrates and exposes a body cavity or produces a&#xD;
        substantial impairment of physical or physiologic function or involves extensive dissection&#xD;
        or transection. Examples of a major abdominal surgery include, but are not limited to, any&#xD;
        procedure involving a laparotomy or laparoscopic procedures of the stomach, duodenum, small&#xD;
        and large intestine and rectum. It also includes but is not limited to procedures on the&#xD;
        reproductive system (total abdominal hysterectomy, salpingo-oophorectomy) and genitourinary&#xD;
        system (nephrectomy, cystectomy).)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient not fulfilling inclusion study criteria above and/or clinician refusal and/or&#xD;
             non-eligible as defined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients undergoing the following surgical procedures will NOT be eligible:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  transplantation&#xD;

          -  vascular&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  endovascular&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of any one of the following will also lead to exclusion of the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ACS at presentation (clinical assessment or documentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New or decompensated congestive heart failure at presentation (clinical assessment or&#xD;
             documentation)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented severe aortic stenosis (valve area &lt; 1cm2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Reduced LVEF (&lt;40%); if no LVEF is available, it will be assumed to be &gt;40%&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to follow the procedures of the study, e.g. due to language problems,&#xD;
             dementia, etc. of the participant&#xD;
