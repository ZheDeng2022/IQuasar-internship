  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that the obese population (BMI ≥30 kg/m2) who might be at higher&#xD;
      risk for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA), carries a higher risk of endoscopy associated adverse&#xD;
      events. The primary aim of our study is to determine predictors of endoscopy associated&#xD;
      adverse events (airway maneuvers and sedation related complications) in the obese population&#xD;
      including the use of the STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ) and Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS). A&#xD;
      secondary aim is to determine the impact of referral to sleep medicine clinic and home sleep&#xD;
      test ordered from the gastroenterologist if patient was found to be high risk for OSA by the&#xD;
      use of validated questionnaires such as SBQ and ESS.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is a chronic condition characterized by episodes of apnea and&#xD;
      hypoxemia caused by upper airway collapse. These episodes lead to symptoms such as daytime&#xD;
      fatigue and sleepiness in addition to multiple effects on health including hypertension,&#xD;
      stroke, cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Obesity, defined by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization and the United States National Institute of Health as a body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      ≥30 kg/m2 is a major risk factor for OSA and along with the obesity epidemic, the prevalence&#xD;
      of OSA has been increasing and is estimated to be around 3-7% in the United States. In 2017&#xD;
      The American Gastroenterological Association release the Practice guide on Obesity and Weight&#xD;
      management, Education and Resources (POWER) that provides guidance on obesity management.&#xD;
      This is in recognition that gastroenterologists are at the frontline of managing patients&#xD;
      with multiple obesity related conditions such as non-alcoholic fatty liver disease,&#xD;
      non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, gastroesophageal reflux, Barrett's esophagus, and colon&#xD;
      cancer. In the midst of these guidelines, recognition of extra gastrointestinal obesity&#xD;
      related conditions such as OSA remains an important task as this can have important long-term&#xD;
      health consequences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different tools modalities to screen for OSA such as STOP-BANG questionnaire (SBQ)&#xD;
      and the Epworth Sleepiness scale (ESS). The SBQ was originally developed to screen patients&#xD;
      in the pre-operative setting as this population may be at higher risk for post-operative&#xD;
      complications, however this tool has been validated by multiple studies to identify patients&#xD;
      that may be at high risk for OSA. A systematic review and meta-analysis on the performance of&#xD;
      SBQ in different populations showed a sensitivity of 90%, 94% and 96% to detect any OSA&#xD;
      (Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) ≥ 5), moderate-to-severe OSA (AHI ≥15), and severe OSA (AHI ≥30)&#xD;
      respectively. The ESS is a simple and validated questionnaire for assessing excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness in the context of sleep disorders and has been suggested as a tool to identifying&#xD;
      patient with OSA. Studies comparing ESS with SBQ showed that although SBQ identify more&#xD;
      patient with OSA, the ESS has a higher specificity which is potentially of use in conjunction&#xD;
      with another higher sensitivity modality such as SBQ may improve the diagnostic accuracy&#xD;
      other screening modalities. Although the sensitivity of Berlin, STOP and STOP-Bang&#xD;
      questionnaires was generally high, the low specificity of these questionnaires results in&#xD;
      increased false positives and failure of exclusion of individuals at low risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high sensitivity of SBQ, high specifity of ESS and ease in performing these questionnaire&#xD;
      makes it an ideal tool to screen patients for OSA in the endoscopy unit. Given the potential&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory decompensations in patients with OSA, multiple studies have used this&#xD;
      questionnaire to determine factors associated with airway maneuvers (AM) and sedation related&#xD;
      complications (SRC). In one study of patients undergoing advanced endoscopic procedures a SBQ&#xD;
      score ≥3 (SBQ+) was associated with increased risk of hypoxemia and the use of AM. These&#xD;
      patients also had a mean BMI of 31.4 kg/m2 which is defined as obesity class I. A similar&#xD;
      study on patients undergoing elective EGD and colonoscopy found no correlation between SBQ+&#xD;
      patients and SRC or AM, however it should be noted that the mean BMI in this SBQ+ population&#xD;
      was 28.3 kg/m2 which does not meet criteria for obesity. Although not statistically&#xD;
      significant there was a trend towards a higher use of AM in the higher BMI group (p=0.066).&#xD;
      In addition the combined analysis of adverse events for EGD and colonoscopies together can be&#xD;
      problematic since only about half of the patients on the study (n=120) underwent EGD which&#xD;
      has a higher risk of transient hypoxemia than colonoscopy, because of the potential of direct&#xD;
      impingement of the airway, laryngeal irritation or micro aspiration during esophageal&#xD;
      intubation17. Also the use of propofol was not standardized and other methods of sedation&#xD;
      were used such as benzodiazepine and opioids.&#xD;
