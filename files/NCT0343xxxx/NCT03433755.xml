  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is being done to learn more about evolocumab in Chinese people with primary&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia or mixed dyslipidemia. This study will see if evolocumab will reduce low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) in Chinese people who are also taking a certain type&#xD;
      of lipid-lowering medication (statins with or without ezetimibe) and whether it causes any&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 3, multicenter, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study of&#xD;
      evolocumab in Chinese participants with hypercholesterolemia and mixed dyslipidemia.&#xD;
      Participants who have signed the informed consent form (ICF) will have fasting lipids&#xD;
      measured and all inclusion and exclusion criteria assessed. All eligible participants must be&#xD;
      taking a maximum appropriate dose of an approved statin, not requiring up titration.&#xD;
      Participants should maintain their current diet and exercise regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment and follow-up period will be 12 weeks with an additional phone call or other&#xD;
      participant contact at week 14 for those receiving investigational product every 2 weeks&#xD;
      (Q2W). The end of study (EOS) for participants on once monthly (QM) investigational product&#xD;
      is at the week 12 visit, which must be at least 30 days post last dose of investigational&#xD;
      product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evolocumab or placebo will be administered by self-injection under the skin at the study site&#xD;
      or in an appropriate non-clinic setting (e.g., at home) by spring based prefilled auto&#xD;
      injector/pen (AI/Pen). Participants must tolerate an injection of placebo with a prefilled&#xD;
      auto injector/pen device to be used during the study prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly added to 1 of 4 groups using a 2:2:1:1 ratio:&#xD;
&#xD;
      evolocumab 140 mg Q2W (86 participants total) evolocumab 420 mg QM (86 participants total)&#xD;
      placebo Q2W (44 participants total) placebo QM (43 participants total). The dose frequencies&#xD;
      of Q2W and QM will not be blinded but the identity of investigational product evolocumab or&#xD;
      placebo will be blinded.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will be screened for this study and if found eligible as described by the study protocol may be randomized into 1 of 4 groups. Randomized means that you are put into a group by chance. It is like drawing numbers out of a hat. Randomization will be done using a 2:2:1:1 ratio. This means for every 6 participants randomized:&#xD;
2 participants will be randomized to evolocumab 140 mg every 2 weeks&#xD;
2 participants will be randomized to evolocumab 420 mg once a month&#xD;
1 participant will be randomized to placebo every 2 weeks&#xD;
1 participant will be randomized to placebo once a month.</intervention_model_description>

                  (FSH) level in the postmenopausal range may be used to confirm a postmenopausal&#xD;
                  state in women not using hormonal contraception or hormonal replacement therapy&#xD;
                  (HRT). However, in the absence of 12 months of amenorrhea, a single FSH&#xD;
                  measurement is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        ii. Females on HRT and whose menopausal status is in doubt will be required to use one of&#xD;
        the non-hormonal highly effective contraception methods if they wish to continue their HRT&#xD;
        during the study. Otherwise, they must discontinue HRT to allow confirmation of&#xD;
        postmenopausal status before study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Acceptable methods of effective birth control include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  sexual abstinence (defined as refraining from heterosexual intercourse during the&#xD;
             entire period of risk associated with the study treatments; the reliability of sexual&#xD;
             abstinence must be evaluated in relation to the duration of the trial and the&#xD;
             preferred and usual lifestyle of the subject. [Periodic abstinence (eg., calendar,&#xD;
             ovulation, symptothermal, postovulation methods), declaration of abstinence for the&#xD;
             duration of a study, and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception])&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  bilateral tubal ligation/occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  vasectomized partner (provided that partner is the sole sexual partner of the female&#xD;
             subject of childbearing potential and that the vasectomized partner has received&#xD;
             medical assessment of the surgical success)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  use of hormonal birth control methods (oral, intravaginal (eg. vaginal ring(s),&#xD;
             transdermal, injectable, or implantable)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  intrauterine devices (IUDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  intrauterine hormonal releasing system (IUS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  2 barrier methods (each partner must use 1 barrier method) the male uses a condom and&#xD;
             the female must choose either a diaphragm, OR cervical cap, OR contraceptive sponge&#xD;
             with spermicide. If spermicide is not commercially available in the country or region,&#xD;
             the 2 barrier method without spermicide is acceptable. (A female condom is not an&#xD;
             option due to the risk of tearing when both partners use a condom.)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female subject is pregnant or breast feeding (nursing), planning to become&#xD;
                  pregnant or planning to breastfeed (nurse) during treatment with investigational&#xD;
                  product and/or within 15 weeks after the end of treatment with investigational&#xD;
                  product.&#xD;

      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were randomized 2:2:1:1 into the following treatment arms: evolocumab140 mg subcutaneously (SC) every 2 weeks (Q2W); evolocumab 420 mg SC once monthly (QM); placebo SC Q2W, or placebo SC QM. Randomization was stratified by entry cardiovascular (CV) risk (high/very high vs. not high/very high). Due to Human Genetic Resource Administration office of China (HGRAC) regulations/restrictions, 17 participants were not included in any analysis.</pre_assignment_details>

      <restrictive_agreement>The Clinical Trial Agreement generally does not restrict an investigator's discussion of trial results after completion. The Agreement permits Amgen a limited period of time to review material discussing trial results (typically up to 45 days and possible extension). Amgen may remove confidential information, but authors have final control and approval of publication content. For multicenter studies, the investigator agrees not to publish any results before the first multi-center publication.</restrictive_agreement>
