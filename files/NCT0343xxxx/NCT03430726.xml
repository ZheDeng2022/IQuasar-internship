  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In adults, probiotics have been shown to have no effect on the microbial composition and the&#xD;
      beneficial effects are only transient. However, the gut microbiota of young children is less&#xD;
      stable and more impressionable. The aim of this study is to examine the effects of probiotics&#xD;
      on the developing microbiota in early life and to determine whether a young child's&#xD;
      microbiota may be less resilient to probiotic-induced changes and possibly resulting in&#xD;
      longer lasting probiotic effects compared to adults.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Probiotics are live microorganisms that have been associated with health benefits. However,&#xD;
      probiotic effects have not been shown to persist beyond discontinuation of use in adults. The&#xD;
      intake of probiotics during the critical window of gut microbiota development in young&#xD;
      children, however, may allow for a longer duration of persistence of probiotic bacteria and&#xD;
      more stable changes in microbial composition possibly resulting in stable engraftment of the&#xD;
      probiotic strains. This study aims is to examine the effect of a 14-day course of a&#xD;
      commercially available probiotic yogurt drink on the composition, diversity, and changes in&#xD;
      immune biomarkers (e.g. human beta-defensin-2 and calprotectin) of the gut microbiota of&#xD;
      healthy children. As well, to assess whether the probiotic strains persists after&#xD;
      discontinuation of intake and whether engraftment occurs. By understanding the impact of&#xD;
      probiotics on the gut microbiota, we will better understand the mechanism by which probiotics&#xD;
      exert their beneficial effects. This may help guide probiotic selection based on the&#xD;
      potential short- and long-term effects on the commensal microbiota.&#xD;
