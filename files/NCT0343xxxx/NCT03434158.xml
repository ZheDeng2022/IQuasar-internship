  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A number of important systemic therapies have been developed to treat mCRPC and have received&#xD;
      regulatory approval and now comprise the current therapeutic landscape. Durable and complete&#xD;
      response following first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced PC are uncommon. Most&#xD;
      patients will ultimately experience disease progression within 6-9 months after initial&#xD;
      response. Optimal Second line therapy in mCRPC is not well established and several options&#xD;
      are possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib has demonstrated anti-tumour activity in non-comparative studies in patients with&#xD;
      germline BReast CAncer gene (gBRCA) mutated cancers including ovarian, breast, pancreas and&#xD;
      prostate. Olaparib is indicated as monotherapy for the maintenance treatment of adult&#xD;
      patients with platinum-sensitive relapsed Breast Cancer gene-mutated (germline and/or&#xD;
      somatic) high grade serous epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer&#xD;
      who are in response (complete response or partial response) to platinum-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase II study is developed to assess the effect of maintenance treatment with olaparib&#xD;
      on radiologic progression free survival (rPFS) in patients with mCRPC who have received at&#xD;
      least 6 cycles of docetaxel and achieved partial or complete response or disease&#xD;
      stabilization according RECIST 1.1 criteria and PCWG3.&#xD;
