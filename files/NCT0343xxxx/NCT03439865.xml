      The purpose of this pilot study is to explore wither ivacaftor in refractory CRS patients&#xD;
      will demonstrate safety and tolerability; restore CFTR-mediated Cl- secretions as measured by&#xD;
      EDSPD testing; produce detectable improvements in validated measures of CRS including the&#xD;
      SNOT-22 questionnaire, Lund-MacKay CT scan grading, and Lund-Kennedy endoscopic scores; and&#xD;
      provide beneficial effects on readily measured markers of sinonasal inflammation and&#xD;
      infection (IP-10, IL-8, and Pseudomonas CFUs).&#xD;

      There is a significant clinical need for new treatment modalities for chronic sinus disease.&#xD;
      Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) causes substantial morbidity and detracts from quality of life&#xD;
      for 16% of the US population. The disease accrues an estimated aggregated cost of $8.6b&#xD;
      annual in healthcare expenditures. Patients with CRS describe poorer scores for physical pain&#xD;
      and social functioning on quality of life questionnaires than those suffering from chronic&#xD;
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, or angina. Conventional CRS&#xD;
      treatments are comprised of antibiotics, steroids, and surgical intervention. These&#xD;
      interventions have been limited by bacterial resistance incurred with antibiotic overuse and&#xD;
      the deleterious side effects of steroids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal sinonasal mucociliary function is a vitally important host defense mechanism that&#xD;
      clears the upper airways of inhaled particles such as bacteria, dusts, and aerosols.&#xD;
      Sinonasal respiratory epithelium is a highly-regulated inert barrier critical to the&#xD;
      mucociliary apparatus. Maintenance of MCC is dependent on intact respiratory epithelium,&#xD;
      proper ciliary beating, and the biological properties of the airway surface liquid (ASL). The&#xD;
      ASL is dramatically affected by alterations of vectorial Cl- and bicarbonate (HCO3-)&#xD;
      secretion through the CFTR as clearly exemplified by cystic fibrosis (CF) airway disease.&#xD;
      These abnormalities of electrolyte transport manifest as thick mucus formation and stasis of&#xD;
      secretions in multiple organ systems, including the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and&#xD;
      reproductive tracts. In the sinuses, chronic stasis of mucus in combination with bacterial&#xD;
      infections results in paranasal sinusitis. Cystic fibrosis (CF) is caused by mutations in the&#xD;
      CFTR gene. The most common cause of CF is a deletion of phenylalanine at CFTR position 508&#xD;
      (F508del CFTR), which confers protein misfolding and degradation from the endoplasmic&#xD;
      reticulum. The absence of CFTR at the plasma membrane results in defective ion transport and&#xD;
      the clinical manifestations of CF. Other mutations, such as the class III mutation Gly551Asp&#xD;
      (G551D), result in adequate levels of CFTR protein at the apical cell surface, but exhibit&#xD;
      defective function. In addition, there is now increasing evidence that wild type CFTR&#xD;
      processing, endocytic recycling, and function can also be markedly compromised by various&#xD;
      environmental insults, including cigarette smoke exposure, high altitude/hypoxemia,&#xD;
      inflammation, and infectious agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFTR is a member of the ATP binding cassette protein family, and composed of two&#xD;
      transmembrane domains (TMs), two nucleotide binding domains (NBDs), and a regulatory domain&#xD;
      (R). Activation of CFTR is thought to be a two-step process that involves 1) phosphorylation&#xD;
      of the R-domain, and 2) dimerization of the two NBDs, facilitating ATP binding and activation&#xD;
      of the Cl- channel by inducing a conformational change in the TMs. One model suggests that&#xD;
      ATP binding to the canonical catalytic site conferred at the dimerization interface of NBD1&#xD;
      and NBD2 promotes opening of the channel gate. New compounds such as ivacaftor, which modify&#xD;
      channel gating of WT-CFTR, F508del-CFTR, G551D-CFTR and nonsense mutations after induction of&#xD;
      translational readthrough (i.e. G542X-CFTR), provide critical tools for understanding&#xD;
      molecular defects caused by a mutation, the molecular basis of gating, and mechanisms&#xD;
      required for mutant protein repair. At the same time, these drugs can be utilized for&#xD;
      examining the molecular basis of environmental perturbations that confer functional and/or&#xD;
      quantitative changes in wild type CFTR, as well as new treatment platforms for ameliorating&#xD;
      the impact of deleterious external influences on healthy airway epithelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ivacaftor is an oral CFTR potentiator identified by screening over 228,000 small-molecules&#xD;
      using high throughput analysis and a cell-based fluorescence membrane potential assay. The&#xD;
      drug was licensed in 2012 both in the United States and Europe for patients with CF aged six&#xD;
      years and over (now 2 years and over) who carry at least one copy of the G551D mutation.&#xD;
      Ivacaftor is the first licensed CF medication that addresses the primary consequences of CFTR&#xD;
      protein dysfunction, rather that the downstream sequelae of the disease. Studies in both&#xD;
      recombinant cell lines and primary cultures of human bronchial epithelia have demonstrated&#xD;
      that ivacaftor promotes Cl- transport by increasing CFTR channel open probability, and&#xD;
      augments both ASL height and ciliary beat frequency (CBF). The efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      ivacaftor in CF patients with at least one G551D mutation has been evaluated in two large,&#xD;
      multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials. Results of these trials,&#xD;
      and a longitudinal cohort of patients receiving the drug, unequivocally showed significant&#xD;
      improvement in markers of CFTR function (sweat chloride and nasal potential difference (NPD)&#xD;
      and clinical endpoints (lung function (FEV1), body mass index, hospitalization rate, and&#xD;
      Pseudomonas burden). Given that one of the primary endpoints showing improvement in the&#xD;
      clinical testing was NPD, the expectation would be that patients should experience benefit in&#xD;
      upper airway disease burden. While clinical outcomes regarding CRS are not published, at&#xD;
      least one case report has shown &quot;medical reversal&quot; of CRS in a patient receiving the drug&#xD;
      with marked improvement in symptoms as well as CT scan before and after starting therapy.&#xD;
      Because MCC is critical to CRS pathogenesis, it is reasonable to presume that ivacaftor will&#xD;
      improve clinical endpoints in non-CF CRS in the setting of acquired CFTR dysfunction. Since&#xD;
      ivacaftor also ameliorates clinical disease of patients with non-G551D gating mutations, the&#xD;
      drug does not confer activity to one specific mutation and thus should be effective&#xD;
      potentiating ion transport regardless of external influences that impact function of the&#xD;
      CFTR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional CRS interventions have been limited by bacterial resistance incurred with&#xD;
      antibiotic overuse and the deleterious side effects of steroids. Ivacaftor is a CFTR&#xD;
      potentiator that has been approved by the FDA for treatment of CF individuals with at least&#xD;
      one copy of the G551D mutation. Enhancing Cl- secretion in sinus epithelia by CFTR&#xD;
      potentiators represents a new and leading edge approach to treatment that has been shown to&#xD;
      activate MCC in human subjects, but has not been investigated previously in non-CF CRS.&#xD;
      Ivacaftor represents one of many drugs that enhance Cl- transport and could provide&#xD;
      significant therapeutic advantages in this regard.&#xD;
