    <textblock>
      Testicular cancer (TC) affects approx. 1% of Danish men and is the most common cancer in men&#xD;
      aged 15-35 years. It is the most curable solid cancer type with a 5-year survival rate of&#xD;
      90-95%. Staging and follow-up of these patients involve 5-10 CT scans of each patient,&#xD;
      imposing a significant radiation burden: Approx. 3-5 of the 300 Danish patients presenting&#xD;
      with TC each year are expected to develop a radiation-induced secondary cancer, half of which&#xD;
      are expected to be fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is rapidly developing and new WB-MRI can cover large parts of the body in a clinically&#xD;
      realistic scan time. With this development, it is within reach to nearly eliminate the&#xD;
      radiation burden by substituting the large amount of CT scans with MRI scans in TC. MRI is&#xD;
      without any known risk of long-term side effects. Despite this, limited data exist on MRI&#xD;
      used in follow-up of TC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Aarhus University Hospital, we introduced MRI for the follow-up of TC stage I in 2008. We&#xD;
      now want to evaluate the results of in this unique cohort of patients and evaluate in a&#xD;
      prospective trial if the newest WB-MRI techniques can replace CT in patients with TC stage&#xD;
      II-IV. To the best of our knowledge, no study has investigated how much it is possible to&#xD;
      reduce the MRI scan time in patients with TC in order to develop a clinically realistic scan&#xD;
      time while still maintaining an acceptable uncompromised diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to reduce the risk of radiation-induced secondary cancers in&#xD;
      patients operated diagnosed with TC by replacing CT as a follow-up imaging method with&#xD;
      non-ionizing WB-MRI including DWI. We have these specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To study the ability of WB-MRI with DWI to replace standard CT in TC stage II-III&#xD;
           patients in a prospective non-inferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate if it is possible to reduce scan time in the WB-MRI protocols in the TC&#xD;
           stage II-III group while maintaining sufficient diagnostic accuracy in order to improve&#xD;
           clinical application of the techniques.&#xD;

      AIMS AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of this study is to reduce the risk of radiation-induced secondary cancers in&#xD;
      patients operated for testicular cancer (TC) by replacing computed tomography (CT) as a&#xD;
      follow-up imaging method with non-ionizing whole body magnetic resonance imaging (WB-MRI)&#xD;
      including diffusion weighted imaging (DWI). Under the hypotheses that MRI can detect relapse&#xD;
      in stage I patients, that MRI is not inferior to CT for diagnosing and monitoring metastatic&#xD;
      disease in stage II-III patients, and that the scan time of MRI with DWI can be reduced in&#xD;
      order to facilitate the clinical and practical feasibility, the trial has two specific aims&#xD;
      leading to two substudies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) To study the ability of WB-MRI with DWI to replace standard CT in TC stage II-III patients&#xD;
      in a prospective, non-inferiority study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) To evaluate if scan time in the WB-MRI can be significantly reduced in the TC stage II-III&#xD;
      group by using multiband DWI technique and by evaluating the minimum necessary image quality&#xD;
      while maintaining sufficient diagnostic accuracy in order to improve clinical applicability&#xD;
      of the technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND TC affects approximately 1% of Danish men with 301 new cases in 2015 and is the&#xD;
      most common cancer in men aged 15-35 years. It is the most curable solid cancer type with a&#xD;
      5-year survival rate of 90-95%; In 2013 97% of Danish patients were alive two years after&#xD;
      diagnosis. According to Danish and European guidelines, staging and follow-up of these&#xD;
      patients involve 5-10 CT scans of each patient, imposing a significant radiation burden.&#xD;
      Based on the risk estimates of BEIR VII and the Danish guidelines, approx. 3-5 of the 300&#xD;
      Danish patients presenting with TC each year are expected to develop a radiation-induced&#xD;
      secondary cancer in their remaining life time, half of which are expected to be fatal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI is rapidly developing with higher availability and higher sensitivity for cancer&#xD;
      detection though the use of DWI and new WB-MRI-technologies that can cover large parts of the&#xD;
      body in clinically relevant scan times. With this development, it is within reach to almost&#xD;
      eliminate this radiation burden by substituting the large amount of CT scans with MRI scans&#xD;
      in TC. MRI is without any known risk of long-term side effects. Despite these obvious&#xD;
      benefits of MRI, limited data exist on MRI used in follow-up of TC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a joint effort between Depts. of Radiology and Oncology at AUH we already introduced MRI&#xD;
      for the follow-up of non-disseminated TC (stage I) in 2008. We now want to evaluate the&#xD;
      results of this unique cohort of patients followed by a prospective trial to evaluate if the&#xD;
      newest WB-MRI techniques can replace CT in patients with disseminated TC (stage II-III).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL DATA in order to establish a reference for relapse, a database with all relevant&#xD;
      data will be established using REDCap database software at Aarhus University. Clinical data&#xD;
      incl. age, blood tests (AFP, hCG and LDH), histopathological reports, prior treatment,&#xD;
      clinical notes, and additional scans will be evaluated for the entire study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not include material for biobanks and data will not be retrieved from or&#xD;
      transferred to other institutions or countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT AND INFORMED CONSENT The patients will be recruited when referred to Dept. of&#xD;
      Oncology, AUH. The patients will be approached by and asked to participate in the study by&#xD;
      the oncologist at their first visit to the department. The patients are encouraged to bring&#xD;
      an assessor. The information will be given in an undisturbed room and written information&#xD;
      will be handed out. The timeframe from referral to treatment is governed by the &quot;pakkeforl√∏b&quot;&#xD;
      set by the Danish Health and Medicines Authority and will not be influenced by participation&#xD;
      in the current investigation. Because of this short time frame the patients are given a&#xD;
      relatively short period of 24 hours for consideration and can request further information&#xD;
      from the principal investigator. Written informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study is covered by the Patient Compensation Association&#xD;
      (Patienterstatningen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBSTUDY A Can WB-MRI (chest, abdomen, pelvis) including DWI with or without CT of the chest&#xD;
      replace the standard contrast enhanced CT for monitoring patients with TC stage II-III?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective comparison of WB-MRI with DWI to standard CT in a non-inferiority paired design&#xD;
      with binary outcome. The non-inferiority design is used as the aim is to evaluate if MRI can&#xD;
      replace CT and because although considered the &quot;golden standard&quot;, the sensitivity of CT for&#xD;
      detecting relapse in patients with TC has been reported to be 70-90%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be performed before treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) is initiated and will&#xD;
      be compared to the standard CT used for staging prior to initiating treatment. At present the&#xD;
      standard of care is a contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis. Each of these&#xD;
      patients will receive one control scan with both MRI and CT in order to assess the ability of&#xD;
      MRI to monitor effect of treatment. Since MRI is known to be less sensitive for detecting&#xD;
      lung metastases than CT, it will furthermore be evaluated if a combination of MRI with a CT&#xD;
      of the chest performs better than MRI alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be performed on a 1.5 T Philips Ingenia scanner equipped with dedicated surface&#xD;
      coils for WB-MRI scanning and a new prototype Multiband DWI technique capable of reducing DWI&#xD;
      scan time with approx. 50% as well as the standard DWI sequences. The total acquisition time&#xD;
      for T1-weighted, T2-weighted, and DWI sequences for chest, abdomen, and pelvis is approx.&#xD;
      40-45 min. No contrast agents will be administered for the MRI scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three datasets will be analysed for comparison:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis WB-MRI with DWI with CT of the chest&#xD;
      reused from above scan WB-MRI with DWI MRI will be evaluated independently and blinded by two&#xD;
      experienced MRI radiologists and CT will be evaluated independently and blinded by two&#xD;
      experienced CT radiologists. Lesions will be characterised by localisation and greatest axial&#xD;
      diameter and characterised as&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. definitely benign&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. probably benign&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. can be either benign or malignant&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. probably malignant&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. definitely malignant For binary analysis 1-2 will be considered benign and 3-5 will be&#xD;
           considered malignant. Histopathology will be recorded if available. Any lesion detected&#xD;
           at follow-up that can be retrospectively detected on at least one of the initial imaging&#xD;
           modalities and shows either increase or decrease (due to treatment) in size will be&#xD;
           classified as a missed metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interreader agreement will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a non-inferiority paired design with a binary outcome&#xD;
      (metastasis or no metastasis on a lesion basis). The patients are their own controls as they&#xD;
      undergo both imaging modalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is designed to claim non-inferiority of WB-MRI with DWI or WB-MRI with DWI plus CT&#xD;
      of the chest compared to standard of care contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen and&#xD;
      pelvis if the confidence interval (CI) of the difference is within a of 10%. Contrast&#xD;
      enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen and pelvis will be considered the golden standard to which&#xD;
      WB-MRI with DWI with or without CT of the chest is compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interreader agreement will be calculated. Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV will be&#xD;
      calculated for both WB-MRI with and without CT of the chest and standard of care CT for&#xD;
      detecting lesions. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dept. of Biostatistics will be consulted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBSTUDY B Can scan time for WB-MRI be significantly reduced in the TC stage II-III group by&#xD;
      using multiband DWI technique and by evaluating the minimum necessary image quality while&#xD;
      maintaining sufficient diagnostic accuracy in order to improve clinical applicability of the&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective comparison of Multiband DWI vs time optimized standard DWI for evaluating&#xD;
      patients with TC stage II-III using CT as reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging from substudy A will be reused, no further imaging is obtained. For both standard DWI&#xD;
      scans and multiband DWI scans, raw DWI data will be saved on the 1.5 T Philips Ingenia MRI&#xD;
      scanner used for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DWI raw data will be reconstructed with different number of signal averages (NSA)&#xD;
      directly corresponding to DWI scans obtained with different acquisition times. In this way,&#xD;
      the effect of decreasing scan time can be studied without acquiring multiple datasets. The&#xD;
      reconstructed &quot;scans&quot; with acceptable image quality will then be studied in a blinded fashion&#xD;
      and compared to CT. In the same way, images with and without Multiband DWI sequences will be&#xD;
      compared to CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI will be evaluated independently and blinded by two experienced MRI radiologists as&#xD;
      described for substudy A and compared to the contrast enhanced CT of the chest, abdomen and&#xD;
      pelvis evaluated in substudy A. To reduce recall bias, the radiologists will evaluate the&#xD;
      different reconstructions in a randomised fashion two months apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV will be calculated for each reconstructed dataset to&#xD;
      determine the fastest scan with acceptable diagnostic accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dept. of Biostatistics will be consulted.&#xD;
