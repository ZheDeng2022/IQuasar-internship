  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to execute a small clinical proof of concept trial: To examine the&#xD;
      effects of losartan on mucociliary clearance (MCC) in patients not eligible for CFTR rescue&#xD;
      therapies&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CF is the most common inherited disease causing a shortened life span, affecting ~30,000&#xD;
      people in the United States with annual health care costs of at least $1.8 billion. The&#xD;
      median age of predicted survival of these patients has improved and is now almost 40 years in&#xD;
      the US. Over the last two decades, investigators have identified ~2,000 mutations in the CF&#xD;
      transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene. These mutations are imperfectly classified&#xD;
      into 5 groups, and small molecules are being developed that rescue group-specific CFTR&#xD;
      mutants. These agents have produced remarkable improvements in some patients. The CFTR&#xD;
      potentiator ivacaftor (Kalydeco™), approved by the FDA mainly for class III mutations&#xD;
      especially G551D, improves ion transport (large decrease in sweat chloride), clinical outcome&#xD;
      (increased FEV1 and weight, decreased exacerbations), and quality of life. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      FDA recently approved Orkambi™ (a corrector and potentiator: lumacaftor plus ivacaftor)&#xD;
      because it reduced exacerbation rates by up to 39% in patients homozygous for F508del.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been demonstrated in vitro that improvements in airway surface liquid (ASL) volume are&#xD;
      highly predictive of changes seen in clinical studies and track with tracheal mucus&#xD;
      velocities measured in sheep in vivo using the CFTR potentiator ivacaftor, inhaled hypertonic&#xD;
      saline and other interventions (preliminary data). ASL volume is regulated by ion fluxes&#xD;
      through ENaC, CFTR, CaCC, and BK channels, and TGF-β1-mediated inflammation in CF cells&#xD;
      decreases activities of CaCC (8) and BK. These findings suggest that effective and safe&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory therapy has the potential to improve mucociliary dysfunction in CF&#xD;
      patients, even in the absence of small molecule therapy. Currently used anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      therapies such as high-dose ibuprofen and steroids produce unwanted side effects that negate&#xD;
      their effectiveness. Other medications showed severe side effects in clinical trials.&#xD;
      However, experiments proposed in this application will test the hypothesis that losartan&#xD;
      provides a safe and effective anti-inflammatory therapy needed to improve outcomes in CF&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Briefly, 16 patients with CF, &gt;18 years of age, who are not on CFTR augmentation therapy will&#xD;
      be recruited for this trial (4 per year). After signing informed consent at the screening&#xD;
      visit, spirometry will be performed, take blood for safety and inflammatory markers, and test&#xD;
      for pregnancy where applicable. Since losartan has teratogenic effects, strict birth control&#xD;
      in female participants will be enforced. Eligible patients will complete visits as following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of life will be assessed by CF quality of life questionnaire - revised (CFQ-R).&#xD;
      Cytokines will be measured from nasal fluid collected by Leukosorb filter paper. After&#xD;
      assessing baselines, a daily dose of 50 mg losartan will be started, followed by a safety&#xD;
      visit 7 days after treatment start (± 2 days). Then, the losartan dose will be increased to&#xD;
      100 mg daily until week 14. Since this trial assesses anti-inflammatory effects of 100 mg&#xD;
      losartan, the total duration will be 14 weeks to achieve &gt;12 weeks of treatment with&#xD;
      losartan.&#xD;
