      Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory disease of the intestine (IBD), evolving with&#xD;
      varying periods of remissions and relapses, characterized by segmental inflammation of the&#xD;
      digestive tract, which can be complicated by stenosis, fistulas or even digestive cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emergence of effective therapeutic strategies has led to the adoption of more ambitious&#xD;
      therapeutic objectives that have no longer the improvement of symptoms but a complete&#xD;
      cicatrization of the intestinal mucosa as an objective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The disadvantage of the latter is the need for its evaluation by ilo-colonoscopy,&#xD;
      &quot;gold-standard&quot;, invasive, not without risks (perforation, anesthesia, hemorrhage), requiring&#xD;
      colonic preparation and hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the use of non-invasive markers performed in routine practice (hemogram, VS,&#xD;
      CRP, fibrinogen, fecal calprotectin, abdominal ultrasound), predictive of this endoscopic&#xD;
      mucosal healing, is a necessity to improve the tolerance of follow-up and allow better&#xD;
      adherence by the patient of the therapeutic project. A decrease in health costs could also be&#xD;
      associated with the use of these markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal ultrasound is an accessible, inexpensive, non-invasive and non-irradiating imaging&#xD;
      medium. It is very useful and has proved its effectiveness in monitoring Crohn's disease to&#xD;
      evaluate the activity of the disease in order to predict mucosal healing and to detect&#xD;
      complications (stenosis, fistula, abscess) (1, 2, 3). However, especially for the study of&#xD;
      the small intestine this act is known to be very dependent on the operator and the conditions&#xD;
      of examination (echogenicity of the patient). In addition, few objective criteria have been&#xD;
      described in the literature for the study of Crohn's disease (2, 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study under submission has developed an ultrasound score of Crohn's disease&#xD;
      activity, which through the study of each segment (distal ileum, right colon / transverse /&#xD;
      left, sigmoid) using 14 criteria , allowed to rule on the activity of the disease and thus to&#xD;
      predict mucosal healing. In this study, which concerned 48 patients, ultrasound scans were&#xD;
      performed by radiologists experienced in abdominal pathology. This score was very easy to use&#xD;
      and powerful to study the disease activity of each segment with 2 parameters in particular:&#xD;
      parietal thickness and changes in fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It therefore seems necessary to confirm the simplicity of this ultrasound score in a&#xD;
      validation cohort to: in particular to study the inter-observer reproducibility so as to be&#xD;
      able to extend the use of this score to non-specialist radiologists.&#xD;
