  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, prospective, non-randomized, open-label study to evaluate the truSculpt&#xD;
      Radiofrequency Device for non-invasive fat reduction in abdominal tissue for up to 14&#xD;
      subjects. Measurement will be histological evaluation of tissue for selective fat necrosis,&#xD;
      with sparing of the dermis and epidermis, following truSculpt treatment vs. untreated&#xD;
      contralateral control.&#xD;
