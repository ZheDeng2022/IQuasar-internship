  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the current study is to compare the impacts of specifically designed power&#xD;
      training and strength training programs on function and physical performance in Parkinson's&#xD;
      patients. Specific aims are to examine the impact of these interventions on performance&#xD;
      variables such as balance, strength, power, posture, gait and physical function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will look at how well two different training programs (strength and power&#xD;
      training) do at improving the participant's physical functions. Before and after training,&#xD;
      the participant will go to our laboratory on four separate days for screening and testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximate time schedules for each day are provided below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 0:00-0:40: Informed consent meeting Mini-mental test, and Health Status Questionnaire,&#xD;
      Hoehn &amp; Yahr Classification of Disability for PD, UPDRS motor examination and PQ-39.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Details regarding study participation will be explained and the participant will be provided&#xD;
      the opportunity to ask questions about the study as well as being informed that the&#xD;
      participant have the right to end participation at any time without consequence. In addition,&#xD;
      this time will be used to identify if the participant can safely take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:40-0:41: Randomization of intervention The participant will successively pull one piece of&#xD;
      paper out of a bowl. Each piece of paper will have one of the two intervention programs on&#xD;
      it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:41-0:46: Anthropometric Measurements The participant's height and weight will be measured&#xD;
      using a standard mechanical physician's scale with a height rod. In addition, the&#xD;
      participant's blood pressure will be measured using our automated system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:46-0:70: Familiarization with the tests Details of each field test including the Berg&#xD;
      Balance Test, TUG, the standard proprioception test on the Proprio 5000, muscle power and&#xD;
      strength, the Dynamic Gait Analysis (DGI), and 3D gait and tremor analysis be explained to&#xD;
      the participant. The participant will be allowed to practice the tests under our guidance and&#xD;
      will be allowed to ask any questions at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Motor Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's speech, facial expression, tremor, rigidity, posture, gait, and slowness of&#xD;
      body movement will be observed and rated by a trained researcher during the course of other&#xD;
      assessment activities and certain other items will be specifically tested by that researcher.&#xD;
      These activities include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rapid hand movement,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  gait initiation and gait,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  rising from chair and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  response to sudden posterior pull on shoulders while standing. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2 0:00-0:05: The Falls Efficacy Scale (FES) This will be used to determine the&#xD;
      participant's level of self-efficacy (how the participant feels about himself or herself) as&#xD;
      it relates to fear of falling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FES takes about 5 minutes to complete and consists of questions related to the&#xD;
      participant's concern about the possibility of falling when the participant do 10 specific&#xD;
      daily living activities (ADL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:05-0:20: The Berg Balance Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Berg Balance Scale is a 14-item test designed to measure the participant's standing&#xD;
      balance while the participant are standing still and moving. The test takes about 15-20&#xD;
      minutes and tests the following activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sitting to standing, Standing unsupported, Sitting unsupported, Standing to sitting,&#xD;
      Transfers, Standing with eyes closed, Standing with feet together, Reaching forward with&#xD;
      outstretched arm, Retrieving object from floor, Turning to look behind, Turning 360 degrees,&#xD;
      Placing alternate foot on stool, Standing with one foot in front, and Standing on one foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:20-0:25: Recovery period&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:25-0:35: The Timed Up and Go Test (TUG) The participant will be asked to stand up from a&#xD;
      standard chair with a seat height of between 40 and 50 cm, walk a 3-m distance at a normal&#xD;
      pace, turn, walk back to the chair, and sit down. The test takes approximately 2-4 minutes to&#xD;
      complete with instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:35-0:40: Recovery period&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:40-0:55: The Dynamic Posturography Test (Proprio 5000) The participant will complete a&#xD;
      dynamic balance test on a moving platform that rocks around at different speeds and angles&#xD;
      and tests how well the participant can keep the participant's balance. For the participant's&#xD;
      safety the participant will wear a harness that is attached to the machine so that the&#xD;
      participant cannot fall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 0:00-0:30: Muscle strength and Power Examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements will be taken during:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest Press (pushing the machine handles away from the chest like the participant do in&#xD;
           a push-up),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Seated Rows (pulling the machine handles toward the body, like rowing a boat)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lat Pulldowns (bringing the machine handles down toward the participant's shoulder)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shoulder Press (pushing the machine handles upward away from the participant's shoulder)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biceps curl (bring the handles up by bending the elbows, like &quot;making a muscle&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triceps pushdown (pushing the handles straight down starting with the elbows bent and&#xD;
           handles at the waist)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Leg Press (sitting with legs bent and pushing outward)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calf Raises (toe pushdown),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip adduction (pushing both legs inward toward the center line of the participant's&#xD;
           body)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hip abduction (pushing both legs outward away from the center line of the participant's&#xD;
           body) Muscle strength and power will be assessed using air resistance rather than&#xD;
           plates. To determine strength, one-repetition maximum (1RM) will be measured for each&#xD;
           muscle group. The participant will perform the concentric phase within the limits of the&#xD;
           participant's own specific range of motion for each joint/movement tested over 2 s&#xD;
           periods. The tester will gradually increase the resistance for each repetition until the&#xD;
           participant are not able to move the lever arm one time through the full ROM. The&#xD;
           participant will be asked how hard the test felt after each repetition and each muscle&#xD;
           group will be finished in a maximum of seven repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:30-0:40: Recovery Period&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:50-0:90: Power test After measurement of the participant's strength for each movement, we&#xD;
      will measure the participant's power using the same machines. The participant's power will be&#xD;
      assessed at 40%, 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, or 90% of the participant's maximum strength depending&#xD;
      on the exercise. Before performing each exercise, the participant will be instructed to&#xD;
      perform the exercises as fast as possible through the full ROM. A 3-minute rest will be&#xD;
      provided between exercises. Three trials will be performed per exercise and the highest power&#xD;
      recorded will be designated as the participant's peak power.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 4 0:00-0:20: Gait Test: The gait test will be a standard 10m gait test at usual (two&#xD;
      trials) and maximum (2 trials) speed. The participant will be timed using a wireless infrared&#xD;
      timing system and movement analysis will be performed using our 3D movement analysis system&#xD;
      and force plates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      0:20-0:25: Recovery Period 0:25-0:40: Hand tremor will be tested using an infrared camera.&#xD;
      The participant will then be asked to turn over five coins and button the front of a shirt.&#xD;
      These tests will be timed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training program After the pre-testing of the study is done, the participant will come to the&#xD;
      lab twice a week for 12 consecutive weeks, for a total of 24 visits. Each visit will be&#xD;
      approximately 60 minutes long and will consist of 5 minutes warm-up, 50 minutes of the&#xD;
      training program to which the participant have been randomly assigned and five minutes of&#xD;
      cool-down. The training programs will be a power training program and a standard strength&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All training will be performed on our Keiser air-driven machines. Subjects will perform 10&#xD;
      exercises including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest Press Seated Rows Lat Pulldowns Shoulder Press Biceps curl Triceps pushdown Leg Press&#xD;
      Calf Raises Hip adduction Hip abduction And perform 3 sets of 12-15 repetitions of each&#xD;
      exercise,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both programs will begin with low resistance/speed training with gradual increases for the&#xD;
      first two weeks and then progress to the specific program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength training will use 75-80% of the subjects maximum for the specific exercise and&#xD;
      contractions will occur at 2s concentric and 3s eccentric. For power training the subjects&#xD;
      will perform the concentric phase at high speed, while eccentric portion lasts approximately&#xD;
      2 sec.&#xD;
