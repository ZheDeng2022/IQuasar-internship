      This is a single centre non-randomised open label phase 1 trial of lung SBRT to part of a&#xD;
      lung lesion in patients with advanced NSCLC in combination with pembrolizumab. This study&#xD;
      will recruit up to 24 patients whose lung cancer has progressed beyond one line of palliative&#xD;
      chemotherapy, and an EGFR or ALK inhibitor if an EGFR driver mutation or ALK gene&#xD;
      rearrangement is present, respectively, and now requires further palliative systemic&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted in two parts; an initial lung SBRT dose escalation phase (Part&#xD;
      A), followed by a lung SBRT dose expansion cohort (Part B). The dose escalation phase is&#xD;
      based on a 3+3 design such that patients will be treated in cohorts of 3-6 patients. A&#xD;
      maximum of 12 patients will be allocated to one of two doses of lung SBRT in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab to determine the MTD, DLTs and RP2D. If there is more than one DLT in cohort 1,&#xD;
      this treatment combination will be deemed as being unacceptable, and it would lead to&#xD;
      termination of the study. Note, there is no de-escalation in cohort 1. During the dose&#xD;
      expansion cohort, 12 patients will have lung SBRT dosed at the RP2D determined during the&#xD;
      dose escalation phase in combination with pembrolizumab to obtain additional safety and&#xD;
      response data. Maintenance pembrolizumab will continue until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities, the patient withdraws consent to the trial, or the patient has&#xD;
      completed 24 months of treatment. A maximum of 24 patients will be treated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive pembrolizumab on cycle (C) 1 day (D) 1, in Part A and B of the&#xD;
      study. All patients will receive lung SBRT on C1D15, C1D17, and C1D19 as per lung SBRT&#xD;
      protocol (See Appendix 3). Although C1D1 can occur +/- 3 days, C1D15, C1D17, and C1D19, must&#xD;
      be scheduled for a Monday, Wednesday and Friday, respectively. Patients in part A will&#xD;
      receive lung SBRT dosed at 30 Gy in 3# in cohort 1, or 54 Gy in 3# in cohort 2. Patients in&#xD;
      Part B will receive the RP2D of lung SBRT, determined in Part A. All patients in Part A and&#xD;
      Part B will receive pembrolizumab dosed at 200 mg every 3 weeks, until disease progression,&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicities, the patient withdraws consent from the trial, or the patient has&#xD;
      completed 24 months of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation phase, a minimum of 3 patients will be required per dose level being&#xD;
      assessed. A minimum gap of 1 week will be left between the treatment of the first and the&#xD;
      second, and between the second and the third patients with the combination of pembrolizumab&#xD;
      and lung SBRT to mitigate against multiple patients suffering from acute toxicity. The DLT&#xD;
      period for this study is 12 weeks from the last dose of lung SBRT (i.e. at C6D1). The dose&#xD;
      escalation will be considered by the Safety Review Committee (SRC) once the 3rd or 6th&#xD;
      patient in the cohort has completed the DLT period. If no DLT is observed at a dose level,&#xD;
      then lung SBRT will be dose escalated to the next dosing level (see Table 1). If 1 out of 3&#xD;
      patients experience a DLT, then the cohort will be expanded to 6 patients. If 1 in 6 patients&#xD;
      experience a DLT, then the dose will be escalated to the next dosing level. However, if ≥ 2&#xD;
      in 6 patients experience a DLT then the maximum administered dose (MAD) will have been&#xD;
      reached, and the RP2D will be the previous dosing level that will be used for the dose&#xD;
      expansion cohorts. If the MAD is seen at dose level 1 then the study will be terminated.&#xD;
      While waiting for 3 or 6 patients to complete the DLT period, no additional patients will be&#xD;
      recruited. Further patients can only be recruited after the SRC has reviewed the toxicity&#xD;
      data for the cohort and taken a decision to dose escalate to the next cohort or expand the&#xD;
      current cohort to 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the MTD has been determined the trial enters the dose expansion phase (unless the MTD is&#xD;
      dose level 1). Here, 12 patients will be treated with the RP2D of SBRT combined with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is ongoing clinical benefit at 24 months, the CI/PI will need to discuss with the&#xD;
      sponsor and MSD, on a case by case basis for the continuation of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
