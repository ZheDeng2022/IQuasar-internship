  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with sickle cell disease (SCD) are living longer with the advent of medical advances&#xD;
      such as prophylactic penicillin, chronic transfusion, and hydroxyurea. Despite greater&#xD;
      longevity in SCD, the period following the transition from pediatric to adult care is&#xD;
      critical; youth aged 18-30 years are at high risk for mortality and have high rates of&#xD;
      healthcare utilization, leading to high healthcare costs. As such, health care transition&#xD;
      (HCT) programs have been created to prepare patients for adult-centered care and&#xD;
      subsequently, improve health outcomes. However, very few programs have been evaluated for&#xD;
      effectiveness in achieving optimal health outcomes in SCD. This paucity of program evaluation&#xD;
      is attributed to a lack of identifiable predictors and outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital want to identify factors and patterns of&#xD;
      successful HCT. This information will be used to develop approaches to best evaluate HCT&#xD;
      interventions and identify areas of improvement of HCT programming.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE: Describe hospital utilization, treatment adherence, and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life in a cohort of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) who will transfer to&#xD;
      adult care during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVE: Examine the associations between various factors and health care&#xD;
      transition (HCT) outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be asked to complete a set of questions during an outpatient clinic visit&#xD;
      at St. Jude or Methodist Adult Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center. The questions ask about&#xD;
      sickle cell disease knowledge and self-management skills, access to care, general adjustment,&#xD;
      quality of life, and stress. These questions will take about 60 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will answer questionnaires on a password protected laptop or tablet using a&#xD;
      computer program called Audio Computer-Assisted Self-Interviews (ACASI). The laptop or tablet&#xD;
      will be kept by the study team. A study team member will be available during this time to&#xD;
      address any technical issues or answer any questions. Participants will answer one of the&#xD;
      questionnaires verbally, and the study team member will record responses from the&#xD;
      questionnaire with paper and pen. Questionnaires given verbally will be audio-recorded and&#xD;
      reviewed by the lead researcher or other study team member. The recordings will be destroyed&#xD;
      immediately after review. No transcript or written record of the recordings will be made.&#xD;
      Study members will meet five times with each participant during regularly-scheduled clinical&#xD;
      visits over a two year period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two institutions will collaborate in the proposed project. St. Jude Children's Research&#xD;
      Hospital (St. Jude) and the Methodist Comprehensive Sickle Cell Center will be the primary&#xD;
      source of participants. Faculty from the University of Memphis, Department of Psychology,&#xD;
      will be involved in methodological considerations and analyzing the data.&#xD;
