  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project is dedicated to identify the patients with possible higher risk of adenoma&#xD;
      recurrence who should have follow-up colonoscopy in yearly interval. As a result, it can lead&#xD;
      to optimizing the of follow-up colonoscopies intervals in real-world practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this project, 200 individuals (aged 18 - 75 years) with removed colorectal polyps larger&#xD;
      than 10 mm during colonoscopy performed based on all indication (including symptoms and&#xD;
      screening procedures) will be included. All procedures will be done with high quality&#xD;
      endoscopes (high definition, HD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all polyps, the advanced imaging techniques (such as chromoendoscopy and NBI) will be used&#xD;
      to determine parts of the polyp suspicious from high-grade dysplasia or cancer. The&#xD;
      therapeutic method will be decided by the size and macroscopic appearance of the polyp. In&#xD;
      case of flat, sessile polyps and LST lesions (laterally spreading tumors) EMR or ESD will be&#xD;
      performed. Pedunculated polyp will be removed by EPE. The goal is to achieve the en-bloc&#xD;
      resection. Pathologists (with presence of the endoscopist) will do the first step of&#xD;
      histopathology evaluation (cutting the polyp tissue). The aim is to perform the first cut in&#xD;
      the most advanced part of the polyp and high density cutting in this area. Standard&#xD;
      histopathology evaluation will proceed and will be followed by initial basic molecular&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, all patients will be observed by colonoscopy in one-year intervals with focus&#xD;
      on polyp recurrence. The group of high-risk patients will be selected with at least one of&#xD;
      these criteria: 1/ high grade dysplasia adenoma at index colonoscopy; 2/ high score of polyp&#xD;
      heterogenity at index colonoscopy; 3/ polyps recurrence at follow-up colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a high-risk patients group the extensive somatic mutations profiling will be carried out&#xD;
      according to multitarget sequencing by NGS technologies (next generation sequencing). Same&#xD;
      testing will be done in randomly selected patients not included in the high-risk group, which&#xD;
      will be used as a control group for statistical evaluation.&#xD;
