  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transesophageal echocardiography is commonly used during cardiac surgery. Complications of&#xD;
      transesophageal echocardiography are rare (1,2%), but are often underestimated and can lead&#xD;
      to unrecognized blood loss and site of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study wants to assess the mucosa of pharynx, upper larynx, esophagus and stomach prior&#xD;
      to and after echo probe insertion during cardiac surgery with endoscopy.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Transesophageal echocardiography is commonly used during cardiac surgery. Main reasons for&#xD;
      its use are the evaluation of cardiac function and valve morphology previous to and after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of transesophageal echocardiography are rare (1,2%). Described complications&#xD;
      may involve the gastrointestinal, cardiovascular or respiratory system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major complication of transesophageal echocardiography is local injury of the GI tract.&#xD;
      Only massive bleeding and perforation were reported, minor injuries are not noticed in the&#xD;
      early postoperative period but may play an important role, especially in patients discomfort,&#xD;
      source of minor unrecognized blood loss and site of infection. As oropharyngeal bacteria are&#xD;
      known to cause endocarditis and graft infection, this site of infection may be of special&#xD;
      interest in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the mucosa of pharynx, upper larynx, esophagus and stomach prior to and after TEE&#xD;
      probe insertion during cardiac surgery using flexible endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open, not randomized, observer blinded, pilot study. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Planned cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age above 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical need for intraoperative use of transesophageal echocardiography Exclusion&#xD;
           criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent gastrointestinal pathologies (3-6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recent operations of the upper gastrointestinal tract (3-6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects not able to understand study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Contraindications for transesophageal echocardiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      After induction of anesthesia and insertion of all needed catheters (arterial catheter,&#xD;
      central venous catheter, bladder catheter, and pulmonary artery catheter, if indicated) an&#xD;
      expert physician will perform the endoscopy (Olympus; Hamburg, Germany) of pharynx,&#xD;
      esophagus, and stomach in order to exclude (respectively map) any alteration of the mucosa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after endoscopy the transesophageal probe (6T, 6T-RS, 6Tc, 6Tc-RS Vivid GE; USA;&#xD;
      X7-2T, S7-2omni, Philips), covered with a special condom, will be inserted. The TOE probe&#xD;
      will remain 7-8 hours in the GI tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two standard echocardiographic examinations are routinely performed during cardiac operation;&#xD;
      the first (prior to skin incision) is assigned as baseline evaluation of cardiac morphology&#xD;
      and function; the second (after weaning from cardiopulmonary bypass) is performed to check&#xD;
      the result of the surgical procedure respectively to determine cardiac function for&#xD;
      decision-making of medical treatment. A routine TEE - examination follows guidelines for&#xD;
      standard TEE views and examination workflow and includes a minimum of 11 views up to a&#xD;
      maximum of 28 views, depending on the type of pathology. Average time needed to perform a&#xD;
      standard TEE examination varies from 5-15minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons the number of TEE views per examination, the length of each examination,&#xD;
      and the different probe positions (upper esophageal, mid esophageal, transgastric and deep&#xD;
      transgastric) during examination and the length of stay of the probe in each position will be&#xD;
      reported. As soon as the TEE probe has been removed the second endoscopy it will be performed&#xD;
      in the same order as the baseline endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible lesions of the mucosa will be classified as described by Geene et al. (Greene 1999,&#xD;
      #9) as follows: erythema, edema, hematoma, mucosal erosion, petechiae, and perforation. In&#xD;
      particular pharynx, upper esophagus, mid esophagus, cardia, gastric fundus, und gastric body&#xD;
      will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of filmed examination will be performed by the endoscopist in a second time&#xD;
      off-line, in a blind manner.&#xD;
