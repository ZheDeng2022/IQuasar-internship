      Diabetes is now the most common chronic disease, affecting nearly 6% of the population in&#xD;
      Western populations. Diabetic neuropathy is a priori the most common and the most common&#xD;
      specific complications of diabetes. It can of course touch the lower limbs, the vegetative&#xD;
      nervous system as well as the cranial nerves. However, the association between hearing&#xD;
      impairment and diabetes has always been controversial on the basis of conflicting literature&#xD;
      data. Are auditory disorders an underestimated complication of diabetes? A meta-analysis made&#xD;
      in 2013, examined the scientific literature between 1950 and 2011 and of the 3158 citations,&#xD;
      only 13 articles were selected. This study found that hearing impairment in diabetic patients&#xD;
      was 2.1 times more prevalent than in non-diabetic matched subjects. In addition, the age /&#xD;
      aging factor is associated with the prevalence of hearing loss and diabetes. However, it also&#xD;
      appears that the link between diabetes and hearing impairment is more pronounced among young&#xD;
      people than older people. In order to document the influence of diabetic pathology on&#xD;
      hearing, Investigator have set up a search audiological exploration platform within the&#xD;
      department of Endocrinology-Diabetology of Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital. It will be&#xD;
      proposed a hearing screening (duration 30 minutes) and a questionnaire to diabetic patients&#xD;
      of the service. In the context of a positive screening, that is to say that one of the tests&#xD;
      carried out reveals the presence of a hearing disorder, an in-depth assessment of the hearing&#xD;
      will be carried out to better characterize the origin of the auditory disturbance (duration&#xD;
      60-90 minutes). These different tests are based on the listening of sounds requiring or not&#xD;
      the participation of patient. Thus, the results of the various tests will make it possible to&#xD;
      classify the impairment of hearing in (1) peripheral impairment (dysfunction of certain cells&#xD;
      of your ear involved in the amplification of sounds), and / or (2) in neural damage&#xD;
      (dysfunction of your auditory nerve).&#xD;

      Diabetes is now the most common chronic disease since it affects western populations such as&#xD;
      France almost 6% of the population. This disease is particularly costly for social protection&#xD;
      systems, not only for the cost of daily care but also by the occurrence of Chronic&#xD;
      complications that are leading to major co-morbidities. Thus, diabetes is a major&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factor. Diabetes also leads to micro-angiopathic complications: Diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy eventually ends up in evolved forms to the first cause of young subject blindness&#xD;
      in developed countries. Nephropathy is one of the first causes of terminal renal failure&#xD;
      leading to extra renal treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic neuropathy seems to be the most common and the most common of the specific&#xD;
      complications of diabetes. It can of course touch the lower limbs, most often training a&#xD;
      symmetrical and distal motor polyneuritis, responsible for the term of Neuro arthropathy of&#xD;
      Charcot. The vegetative nervous system can also be achieved with cardiovascular,&#xD;
      gastrointestinal, genitourinary, neuro-vascular, metabolic and pupil consequences. The&#xD;
      injuries of the cranial nerves are also possible and are most frequently characterized by&#xD;
      facial paralysis or motor eye nerves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The association between hearing disorders and diabetes has always aroused controversy on the&#xD;
      part of contradictory literature data. Are hearing disorders an underestimated complication&#xD;
      of diabetes? A recent meta-analysis of 2013, examined the scientific literature between 1950&#xD;
      and 2011 and of the 3158 citations, only 13 articles were selected (with more than 20 000&#xD;
      participants). This study found that hearing disorders in diabetic patients were 2.1 times&#xD;
      more prevalent than in non-diabetic paired subjects. In addition, the age/aging factor is&#xD;
      associated with the prevalence of hearing impairment and diabetes. However, it also appears&#xD;
      that the link between diabetes and hearing disorder is more pronounced among young people&#xD;
      than the elderly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, it is regrettable that in the majority of the &quot;diabetes-hearing disorders&quot;&#xD;
      studies were not exhaustive from the point of view of the documentation of the alteration of&#xD;
      the hearing function. Indeed, the indices of impairment of the hearing are essentially based&#xD;
      on a review of the audiograms. No more relevant objective test, allowing to evaluate more&#xD;
      precisely the different functional compartments of the inner ear, has been achieved. Indeed,&#xD;
      it would be wise to elucidate which (s) are the targets (s) of the diabetes. Classical&#xD;
      hearing impairment mainly affects cochlear sensory cells and more specifically external hair&#xD;
      cells. However, it is possible to envisage that the alteration of the micro-vascularization&#xD;
      of the vascular Streak (ischemic disorders), a selective expectation of the nerve fibers&#xD;
      (hearing neuropathy), the metabolic disturbances at the mitochondrial level, Oxidative stress&#xD;
      with free radical production, advanced glycation products (AGE, advanced glycation&#xD;
      end-products).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective is the assessment of the prevalence of hearing impairment (with or&#xD;
           without clinical manifestation) in a population of type 1 and type 2 diabetic persons&#xD;
           treated and followed during a hospitalization or consultation in the Department of&#xD;
           Endocrinology-Diabetology of the CHU de Clermont-Ferrand.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identify the proportion of patients with a peripheral explanation for their hearing&#xD;
      impairment (involvement of the outer ciliated cells, 'classic deafness) Identify the&#xD;
      proportion of patients who have a neural explanation for their hearing impairment&#xD;
      (hearing-type neuropathy) And categorize types of hearing impairment by types of diabetes,&#xD;
      its balance, age, absence or absence of complication, age of patient, sex of patient, noise&#xD;
      exposure in a professional manner or as a part of recreation, taking ototoxic drugs, smoking.&#xD;
