  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rates of cesarean deliveries (CD) and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) are on the rise, with&#xD;
      failed induction and augmentation of labor as major contributing factors. Oxytocin is&#xD;
      commonly used for labor induction, as well as during the third stage of labor to minimize the&#xD;
      risk of primary PPH. At delivery, it is imperative that the uterus responds effectively to&#xD;
      parenteral oxytocin. Poor response to oxytocin following delivery is commonly due to&#xD;
      prolonged labor with oxytocin augmentation that is known to &quot;desensitize&quot; the myometrium.&#xD;
      Despite the option of several second line uterotonic agents, none of them are as effective as&#xD;
      oxytocin in controlling PPH. Given that poor uterine muscle contraction is the root cause of&#xD;
      both failed induction or augmentation (leading to a CD in labor) and uterine atony (leading&#xD;
      to PPH), there is an urgent and clinically important need to investigate novel methods to&#xD;
      enhance oxytocin-induced myometrial contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propranolol, a beta adrenergic receptor agonist, has the potential to improve myometrial&#xD;
      contractions by virtue of its ability to inhibit catecholamine production. The investigators&#xD;
      plan to investigate the effects of propranolol in both naive and desensitized myometrium, in&#xD;
      order to better understand its potential role in improving labor induction and reducing the&#xD;
      risk of PPH following oxytocin exposure during labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that propranolol is likely to potentiate the action of oxytocin&#xD;
      upon human myometrium, to ultimately help improve the success of labor induction/augmentation&#xD;
      and treatment of PPH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Myometrial samples will be used to investigate the effect of propranolol on uterine&#xD;
      contractions when exposed to high and low doses of oxytocin (to simulate PPH treatment and&#xD;
      labor induction respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tissue will also be frozen at the end of the experiment, and Western blotting will be&#xD;
      used to investigate the effect of propranolol on the expression patterns and cellular&#xD;
      distribution of the oxytocin receptor and beta-adrenergic receptor and their signaling&#xD;
      pathways in desensitized myometrium.&#xD;
