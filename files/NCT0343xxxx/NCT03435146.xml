    <textblock>
      Single-arm, single-center, Phase I/II clinical trial, in four groups. Individuals with HIV&#xD;
      infection taking Efavirenz (EFV) and two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTI)&#xD;
      who have undetectable (Groups 1 and 2) or detectable (Group 3 and 4) HIV viral load and an&#xD;
      indication for TPT, will be switched to DTG with tenofovir/emtricitabine (Groups 1 and 2) or&#xD;
      lamivudine/tenofovir (Groups 3 and 4). Group 1 and 2 will receive weekly HP for 12 total&#xD;
      doses starting 8 weeks after initiating DTG. Individuals who are on an existing DTG-based&#xD;
      plus two NRTI ART regimen for at least eight weeks (and have not received efavirenz or&#xD;
      nevirapine for at least two months) who have an undetectable HIV viral load may also&#xD;
      participate. Individuals with HIV infection who are ART treatment naïve at any HIV viral load&#xD;
      level and have an indication for TPT will start DTG and be enrolled to receive standard IPT&#xD;
      (Group 3) or HP (Group 4) initiated at the same time as DTG. Group 3 and 4 will be enrolled&#xD;
      after follow up of Group 1 and 2 has been completed.&#xD;

      Group 1 (n=30): The first 12 participants (Group 1A) will take dolutegravir 50 milligrams&#xD;
      (mg) once daily (with tenofovir/emtricitabine) from Days 1-57. Semi-intensive PK sampling for&#xD;
      dolutegravir will be performed on Day 57. Participants will continue once-daily dolutegravir&#xD;
      and will receive once-weekly HP for 12 total doses beginning on Day 58. Semi-intensive PK&#xD;
      sampling for dolutegravir will be performed on Day 72 (with the 3rd dose of HP) and Day 108&#xD;
      (following the 8th dose of HP). Trough concentrations (CT) will be measured on Days 59, 74,&#xD;
      and 78. PK assessments will be performed at weeks 9 and 11 for rifapentine and at week 11 for&#xD;
      isoniazid. VL will be measured at baseline and weeks 11 and 24. Safety labs (complete blood&#xD;
      count (CBC), urea and electrolytes (U&amp;E) and creatinine and liver function tests (LFT)) will&#xD;
      be obtained at baseline, and weeks 9, 11, 13, 16, 20 and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the 12 Group 1A participants have completed the second semi-intensive PK visit, an&#xD;
      interim PK, safety, and VL assessment will be performed to ensure that the 50 mg once daily&#xD;
      dose is safe and meets PK targets. The subsequent 18 participants in Group 1 (Group 1B) will&#xD;
      receive either dolutegravir 50 mg or a higher dose of dolutegravir, if dose adjustment is&#xD;
      required (e.g. dolutegravir 50 mg twice daily just on HP dosing days, dolutegravir 50 mg&#xD;
      twice daily seven days a week, etc.) A second interim evaluation focused on PK will occur&#xD;
      after all Group 1B participants have completed the Week 11 semi-intensive PK visit. This&#xD;
      evaluation will include all PK data from Group 1A, who will have completed their Week 16&#xD;
      semi-intensive PK visit plus PK data from Group 1B up to and including the Week 11&#xD;
      semi-intensive PK visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A third interim evaluation focused on safety and virologic response will occur after all&#xD;
      participants (Groups 1A, 1B, and 2) have completed the Week 11 visit. This evaluation will&#xD;
      include all safety data and HIV viral load information collected up until that point from all&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (n=30): These participants will receive dolutegravir and HP at the same doses and&#xD;
      dose schedule as the participants in Group 1B. They will undergo safety assessments at&#xD;
      baseline and weeks 9, 11, 13, 16, 20 and 24; HIV VL assessments will be performed at baseline&#xD;
      and weeks 11 and 24. Sparse (trough) PK samples for dolutegravir will be collected on two&#xD;
      occasions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 (n=25): The next 25 participants who are ART treatment naïve will start dolutegravir&#xD;
      50 milligrams (mg) once daily (with tenofovir/lamivudine on study Day 0. Sparse PK sampling&#xD;
      for trough concentrations (CT) of dolutegravir will be performed on Day 1 (24 hours after&#xD;
      taking the first dose of DTG, and before taking the first dose of standard isoniazid). Sparse&#xD;
      PK sampling for trough concentrations (CT) of dolutegravir will be performed on Day 24 (Week&#xD;
      3), to parallel 721 hours after the 3rd dose of HP. The final sparse PK sampling for trough&#xD;
      concentrations (CT) of dolutegravir will be performed on Day 59 (Week 8), to parallel 721&#xD;
      hours after the 8th dose of HP. HIV VL will be measured at screening, and Weeks 3, 8, 12, 16,&#xD;
      and 24. Safety labs (complete blood count (CBC), urea and electrolytes (U&amp;E) and creatinine&#xD;
      and liver function tests (LFT)) will be obtained at baseline. Creatinine will be repeated at&#xD;
      Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16 and 24 and LFTs will be repeated at weeks 4, 8, and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 (n=50): After Group 3 is fully enrolled, another group of 50 participants who are ART&#xD;
      treatment naïve will start dolutegravir 50 milligrams (mg) once daily (with&#xD;
      tenofovir/lamivudine) on Day 0. They will begin TPT with once weekly HP the day after&#xD;
      starting DTG, on Day 1. Sparse PK sampling for trough concentrations (CT) dolutegravir will&#xD;
      be performed on Day 1 (24 hours after the first dose of DTG, before the first dose of HP).&#xD;
      Sparse PK sampling for trough concentrations (CT) of dolutegravir will be performed on Day 24&#xD;
      (721 hours after the third dose of HP). Sparse PK sampling for trough concentrations (CT) of&#xD;
      dolutegravir will be performed on Day 59 (721 hours after the eighth dose of HP). HIV VL will&#xD;
      be measured at screening, and Weeks 3, 8, 12, 16, and 24. Safety labs (complete blood count&#xD;
      (CBC), urea and electrolytes (U&amp;E) and creatinine and liver function tests (LFT)) will be&#xD;
      obtained at baseline. Creatinine will be repeated at Weeks 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 24, and LFTs&#xD;
      will be repeated at weeks 4, 8, and 12.&#xD;
