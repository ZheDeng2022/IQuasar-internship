  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be investigating how a common blood test for identifying heart damage&#xD;
      (Troponin T) is affected by red blood cell damage in the blood sample (Haemolysis). It is&#xD;
      already known that damage to the red blood cells during or after blood sample collection can&#xD;
      cause falsely low test results however the exact amount is not clear. Some previous studies&#xD;
      suggest that a much higher amount of red blood cell damage could be allowable when reporting&#xD;
      the test results. This study will mimic the type of red blood cell damage that occurs in the&#xD;
      hospital and determine what degree of damage or 'haemolysis' causes a significant reduction&#xD;
      in the test result and therefore determine an allowable limit for safely reporting the test&#xD;
      result. The results of this study may help provide an evidence based approach to improving&#xD;
      current practice and may lead to fewer rejected blood samples, fewer repeat tests, improved&#xD;
      A&amp;E treatment times, general cost savings and an improved service to patients.&#xD;

      This study will be investigating how a common blood test for identifying heart damage&#xD;
      (Troponin T) is affected by red blood cell damage in the blood sample (Haemolysis). It is&#xD;

      hospital and determine what degree of damage or 'haemolysis' causes a significant reduction&#xD;
      in the test result and therefore determine an allowable limit for safely reporting the test&#xD;
      result. The results of this study may help provide an evidence based approach to improving&#xD;
      current practice and may lead to less rejected blood samples, fewer repeat tests, improved&#xD;
      treatment times in Accident and Emergency (A&amp;E), general cost savings and an improved service&#xD;
      to patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as a Masters research project in Biomedical sciences (Clinical&#xD;
      Biochemistry) as well as providing evidence to evaluate current laboratory practice.&#xD;
      Participants attending Poole Hospital accident and emergency who are already having blood&#xD;
      samples taken for the heart damage blood test, high sensitivity Troponin T (hs-cTnT), are&#xD;
      chosen for this study. As the participants are already having the hs-cTnT blood test&#xD;
      performed it means the investigators will not be determining any new information about them&#xD;
      from the tests and they are also the population that the results of the study will benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whilst the participants are having the routine blood samples taken for their medical&#xD;
      investigation, an extra two blood samples will be collected (a maximum of 9 ml; less than two&#xD;
      teaspoons) following verbal permission. Only patients with the capacity to give verbal&#xD;
      consent will be included in the study and then their blood will only be taken once. The extra&#xD;
      blood samples will be labelled with the time and date of collection (to ensure stability when&#xD;
      analysing). No patient identifying information will be written on the samples and they will&#xD;
      be sent to the laboratory in a separate bag from the routine specimens to ensure anonymity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once received in the laboratory, one of the study samples will be analysed for hs-cTnT and&#xD;
      haemolysis index (a measured value that equates to the amount of haemoglobin in the sample&#xD;
      and therefore red blood cell damage). The results from these initial tests will determine if&#xD;
      the hs-cTnT and haemolysis are within the desired range for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the sample meets the requirements for the study, a sample specific haemolysate (Haemolysed&#xD;
      serum) will be created from the second sample. Using both samples, varying controlled degrees&#xD;
      of haemolysis will be created and then tested for hs-cTnT. The results from the varying&#xD;
      degrees of haemolysis will be compared to the original unhaemolysed result to determine&#xD;
      whether a significant change in the result has occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Null hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no significant difference in hs-cTnT results between baseline and up to 100&#xD;
           haemolysis index. There is a significant difference in hs-cTnT results between baseline&#xD;
           and all haemolysis index levels greater than 100.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  There is no significant difference in mean percentage change of hs-cTnT up to 100&#xD;
           Haemolysis index and there is a significant difference in mean percentage change of&#xD;
           hs-cTnT at all Haemolysis levels greater than 100 haemolysis index.&#xD;
