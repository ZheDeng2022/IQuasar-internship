  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase Ib/II trial studies how well anti-PD-L1/TGFbetaRII fusion protein M7824 (M7824)&#xD;
      works in treating patients with colorectal cancer (or with other solid tumors with&#xD;
      microsatellite instability) that has spread to other places in the body or cannot be removed&#xD;
      by surgery. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as M7824, may help the body's&#xD;
      immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow&#xD;
      and spread.&#xD;

           circulating-free DNA (cfDNA), exosomes, and circulating tumor cells (CTC).&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. To describe changes in microbiome profiling upon treatment with M7824 (with or without&#xD;
           radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
