  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the therapeutic effect of ezetimibe on nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, the&#xD;
      effect of rosuvastatin 5mg monotherapy and rosuvastatin 5mg / ezetimibe 10mg combination&#xD;
      therapy n patients with hyperlipidemia and fatty liver will be compared and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study included a total of 70 patients (35 per subgroup) for randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      with prospective, open label, randomized, single-institution clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug will be maintained for a total of six months. The primary endpoint is the difference&#xD;
      of liver fat change measured by MRI-PDFF in colocalized regions of interest within nine liver&#xD;
      segments between two groups.&#xD;
