      This phase II trial studies the best dose and side effects of sorafenib tosylate and&#xD;
      nivolumab in treating patients with liver cancer that cannot be removed by surgery&#xD;
      (unresectable), has spread to nearby tissues or lymph nodes (locally advanced) or to other&#xD;
      places in the body (metastatic). Sorafenib tosylate may stop the growth of cancer cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may&#xD;
      interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving sorafenib tosylate and&#xD;
      nivolumab may work better in treating patients with liver cancer.&#xD;

      (PO) once daily (QD) or twice daily (BID) on days 1-28, and nivolumab intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      30 minutes on days 1 and 15. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New patients are assigned to 1 of 2 arms. (Part 2: Child Pugh B Expansion Cohort).&#xD;
&#xD;

      tosylate PO beginning on day 15 of cycle 1, then on days 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LEAD-IN ARM II: Patients receive sorafenib tosylate PO on days 1-28, and nivolumab IV over 30&#xD;
      minutes beginning on day 15 of cycle 1, then on days 1 and 15 of subsequent cycles. Cycles&#xD;
      repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 100 days, then every&#xD;
      3 months for up to 2 years.&#xD;
