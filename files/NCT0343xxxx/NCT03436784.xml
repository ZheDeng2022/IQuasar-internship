  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to determine the efficacy of SNAP-Ed to improve the immediate and&#xD;
      long-term dietary quality (using the Healthy Eating Index (HEI)), BMI (measured height and&#xD;
      weight), and food security (using the 18-item US HFSSM) and how the provision of SNAP-Ed with&#xD;
      the presence of other characteristics can mediate improvement in these outcomes. The&#xD;
      hypothesis of this study is that dietary quality and food security will improve and BMI will&#xD;
      remain steady over the short-term, and these improvements will be maintained over a 1-year,&#xD;
      or &quot;long-term&quot;, time frame in participants receiving SNAP-Ed compared to those not receiving&#xD;
      SNAP-Ed. Results may be used as a basis for changes to the program or policies relevant to&#xD;
      SNAP-Ed and other nutrition education programs throughout the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEP educators are considered key personnel because they will have direct contact with study&#xD;
      participants; however, they will not have any part in data entry, analysis, or dissemination&#xD;
      of study results. NEP educators, employees of Purdue University Extension, across Indiana&#xD;
      will help facilitate the study. NEP educators have completed CITI training as a requirement&#xD;
      for employment through Purdue University Extension. Before recruiting study participants,&#xD;
      participating NEP educators will attend training sessions facilitated by the co-investigators&#xD;
      of the study. The training sessions will include instructions on how to interact with&#xD;
      participants; answer questions related to the study; and protocol for administering surveys,&#xD;
      measuring height and weight, keeping participant information private, and the use of&#xD;
      identification numbers. The study goals and hypothesis will not be shared with the NEP&#xD;
      educators in order to keep their work with the participants as unbiased as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NEP educators will recruit study participants who are interested in participating in NEP. The&#xD;
      details of recruitment are described in Section D. A screening survey determining eligibility&#xD;
      will be administered in addition to an explanation of consent. After completion of the&#xD;
      screening survey and consent process, NEP educators will randomize participants into one of&#xD;
      two groups: control or experimental. The NEP educators will be assigned a random number using&#xD;
      Excel and then listed in order from least to greatest according to their random number. The&#xD;
      first half of the NEP educators will assign their first recruited participants to the&#xD;
      experimental group. After the first assignment, they will alternate assigning participants to&#xD;
      either study group in an &quot;every other&quot; participant fashion. The second half of the NEP&#xD;
      educators will assign their first recruited participants to the control group. After the&#xD;
      first assignment, they will also alternate assigning participants to either study group in an&#xD;
      &quot;every other&quot; participant fashion. The control group will wait 1 year from taking the second&#xD;
      survey before starting NEP lessons. The experimental group will start NEP lessons&#xD;
      immediately. Participants in the experimental group must take at least the first 4 NEP&#xD;
      lessons within a time period of 4 to 10 weeks. The NEP SNAP-Ed curriculum includes 10&#xD;
      lessons, and participants may take the additional 6 lessons if desired.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will complete three 30 minute surveys throughout the study. Surveys will be&#xD;
      administered by NEP educators using the Qualtrics Offline Application on their&#xD;
      program-provided iPads or paper surveys. The first survey will be administered upon&#xD;
      enrollment in the study. Participants in the experimental group will take the second survey&#xD;
      after they have completed the first 4 lessons between 4 and 10 weeks after enrollment in the&#xD;
      study. Control participants will take the second survey after 4 to 10 weeks with no lessons.&#xD;
      Since participants will be recruited on a rolling basis, they will take surveys at different&#xD;
      times within a designated time period. The third survey will be administered to both groups 1&#xD;
      year after the second survey. Surveys are comprised of the US Household Food Security Survey&#xD;
      Module from the United States Department of Agriculture Economic Research Service, questions&#xD;
      querying household and individual level characteristics, and the Indiana Food and Nutrition&#xD;
      Program Evaluation Tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also complete two 24-hour dietary recalls using the Automated Self-Assisted&#xD;
      24-hour recall (ASA-24) and one food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) using the Diet History&#xD;
      Questionnaire II (DHQ II) at each data collection time point. Both instruments are online and&#xD;
      complementary dietary assessment tools created by the National Cancer Institute and have a&#xD;
      respondent and researcher website. Results will be analyzed by the researchers using the&#xD;
      researcher website. One dietary recall and the FFQ may be administered by the NEP Educators&#xD;
      immediately following the in person survey, or a link to complete the dietary recall and FFQ&#xD;
      online will be emailed to the participant within 2 days, or the participant can request to&#xD;
      complete the dietary recalls and FFQ over the phone with the co-investigators at Purdue&#xD;
      within 7 days after completing the survey. A script will be provided for the Purdue&#xD;
      researchers to administer the dietary recalls and FFQ. The completion of the dietary recalls&#xD;
      and the FFQ is necessary to perform complex modeling techniques for estimating usual dietary&#xD;
      intake. The program that administers the dietary recalls assists participants through the&#xD;
      recall process using an animated guide with audio and visual cues. Previous research has&#xD;
      shown that the majority of Indiana SNAP-Ed participants have a computer with high-speed&#xD;
      Internet connection in their home or residence. Participants without email, without access to&#xD;
      a computer with internet, or with limited computer skills will be instructed to complete the&#xD;
      assessments via telephone with assistance from researchers. If assistance from researchers is&#xD;
      needed via telephone, participant identifying information will not be collected at that time.&#xD;
      Participants will be identified only by their participant identification number, which they&#xD;
      will receive upon enrollment in the study. Participants will provide days and time frames&#xD;
      over the following week when they will be available to complete the dietary assessments over&#xD;
      the phone with Purdue researchers. In addition, participants may call the co-investigator's&#xD;
      Purdue office phone number any time after the survey for assistance with completing the&#xD;
      dietary assessments. If the first dietary recall and FFQ have not been completed within 4&#xD;
      days after the survey, researchers will call the participant no more than once per day to&#xD;
      complete the first dietary recall and FFQ over the phone at that time or to set up&#xD;
      appointments to complete the dietary recalls and FFQ over the phone with researchers within&#xD;
      the 7 days after completing the in person survey. The second dietary recall should be&#xD;
      completed 24 hours after the first dietary recall at the earliest but before 9 days after&#xD;
      completing the in person survey. Participants will have the same options as described above&#xD;
      to complete the second dietary recall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to the survey, dietary recalls, and FFQ, NEP educators will take height and&#xD;
      weight measurements on each participant at each assessment time point. Weights will be&#xD;
      measured using the SECA 869 mobile medical flat scale with remote display. Heights will be&#xD;
      measured using the SECA 213 mobile stadiometer. This weight scale and stadiometer are&#xD;
      research grade measurement tools. Height and weight measurements will be taken following the&#xD;
      Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) National Health and Nutrition Examination&#xD;
      Survey (NHANES) anthropometry manual guidelines. Height and weight measurements will be&#xD;
      completed in a private setting or privacy screens will be used. Only the NEP educators will&#xD;
      be able to see the measurements. Three measurements will be taken at each assessment time&#xD;
      point in order to calculate an average. Participants will be allowed to know their&#xD;
      measurements upon request at the time of measurement. Researchers will use these measurements&#xD;
      to calculate BMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An in person survey, two dietary recalls, one FFQ, and height and weight measurements will be&#xD;
      completed for each participant at each of the three assessment time points. The first and&#xD;
      third assessments will cover a reference period the past 12 months, while the second&#xD;
      assessment will cover the past 30 days. Participants randomized to the control group will be&#xD;
      provided the opportunity to complete the SNAP-Ed program at the completion of the study.&#xD;
