  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Berberine from medicinal plants has therapeutic activities against multiple chronic diseases.&#xD;
      But its absorption rate is very low. The objective of this study is to test if adding TPGS or&#xD;
      Quillaja extract as an emulsifier enhance the absorption of berberine in human.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Berberine is widely used as an herbal medicine and many health benefits. These&#xD;
      well-documented in the literature including lowering blood lipids and glucose, having&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory and anti-tumor activity, preventing and delaying neurodegenerative diseases&#xD;
      (Alzheimer, Parkinson and Huntington disease) and preventing obesity. However, the absorption&#xD;
      rate of berberine is very low. The study team believes adding TPGS or Quillaja extract as an&#xD;
      emulsifier enhance the absorption of berberine in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioavailability of berberine is extremely low. Only 0.5% of orally ingested berberine are&#xD;
      absorbed in small intestine and about 0.36% can enter the systemic circulation. About 56% of&#xD;
      ingested berberine was not absorbed and additional 43.5% is lost due to metabolism in small&#xD;
      intestine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin E TPGS (a water-soluble form of vitamin E) is a food additive approved by FDA. It has&#xD;
      the potential to increase the absorption of drugs and dietary supplements. TPGS is an&#xD;
      effective inhibitor of P-glycoproteins that are responsible for decreased absorption rate of&#xD;
      many drugs including berberine. TPGS has the potential be a safe and effective adsorption&#xD;
      enhancer for berberine and other bioactive botanicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quillaja extract is a natural GRAS (generally recognized as safe) food-grade&#xD;
      surfactant/emulsifier ingredient rich in saponins and sapogenins. It is purified from the&#xD;
      Quillaja Saponaria Molina tree which is native to Chile. Quillaja extract is an approved&#xD;
      ingredient for use in Food and Beverages by FDA under Title 21 CFR 172.51. It is an approved&#xD;
      food additive in the European Union under code E 999. Quillaja extract is an attractive&#xD;
      alternative emulsifier for berberine formulation because it meets consumers' demand for&#xD;
      natural ingredient. Quillaja extract provides additional benefits of anti-inflammation and&#xD;
      cholesterol lowering to dietary supplement. Some early study before 2000 suggested that&#xD;
      Quillaja saponin DS-1 promote the absorption of insulin and aminoglycoside antibiotics via&#xD;
      the ocular and nasal route by reducing permeability of epithelial barrier. However, it is not&#xD;
      known whether quillaja affect absorption of berberine in vivo or in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine whether TPGS or Quillaja extract emulsification increase the&#xD;
           bioavailability of orally ingested berberine in human volunteers by increasing its&#xD;
           plasma concentration time curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), and elimination half&#xD;
           time (T1/2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether TPGS or Quillaja extract emulsification alter phase I metabolism,&#xD;
           phase II metabolism, or metabolism by gut microbiota for orally ingested berberine in&#xD;
           human&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of this research is that TPGS or Quillaja extract emulsification enhances the&#xD;
      bioavailability of orally ingested berberine in human by altering it metabolism and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advertisement will be in the form of flyers. Contact information of investigators will be&#xD;
      included in the flyer. All participants will be received written and oral information&#xD;
      regarding the natural and potential risks of the study. The informed consent form will be&#xD;
      given to the participants to get consent in a private room 7 days before the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening, Tolerability Test and Informed Consent: Subject will take two capsules of the&#xD;
      reference berberine dietary supplement with 8 ounces of room temperature water and subject&#xD;
      will remain in a fasted state for 4 hours. After completing 4 hours period, a standard lunch&#xD;
      with water will be served. If subject experiences diarrhea after taking supplement, she/he&#xD;
      will immediately report to the Principle Investigator, Dr. Wang or the Study coordinator. The&#xD;
      result of tolerability test will base on the self-assessment of diarrhea. Twelve participants&#xD;
      will be chosen having no symptoms of diarrhea Experiment process: Participants will be&#xD;
      advised to avoid berberine, vitamin E TPGS or Quillaja extract supplements and foods,&#xD;
      excessive amount of alcohol from the beginning of 7-day run in period to the end of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive three treatments (A: TPGS emulsified berberine or B:Quillaja&#xD;
      extract emulsified berberine soft gel and C: berberine reference powder in hard shell&#xD;
      capsules) using a randomized crossover design. Treatment A, B and C provide an equal amount&#xD;
      of berberine at 800 mg dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twelve healthy subjects will be randomly assigned into three groups with 4 in each group.&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to collect initial urine samples in an 8-ounce container provided by&#xD;
      the study team before taking the supplement and the rest of urine samples will be collected&#xD;
      in a different container after taking supplement for 12 hours period. A trained and certified&#xD;
      phlebotomist will be hired to draw blood. A catcher will be implanted in the participants&#xD;
      forearm for blood draw. After a baseline blood sample is taken, four participants in group A&#xD;
      will receive at two capsules of TPGS emulsified berberine in soft gel (2x400mg) and four&#xD;
      subjects in group B will receive four capsules of the Quillaja extract emulsified berberine&#xD;
      (4x200mg) in soft shell capsules, and four participants in group C will receive at two&#xD;
      capsules of berberine reference powder (2x400mg) in hard shelf. Additional blood samples will&#xD;
      be drawn at 0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, 3h, 4 h, 6 h, 8 h and 12 h for analysis of plasma concentrations&#xD;
      of berberine and berberrubine. In addition, the participants will collect all urine samples&#xD;
      in a gallon size plastic container during 12 h after the initial dose. A standard breakfast&#xD;
      of plain bagel with cream cheese will be given to each participant between 0.5 h and 1 h&#xD;
      blood draw. After 4 h blood draw, subjects will be given an identical meal for lunch.&#xD;
      Immediately after collection, blood samples will be centrifuged and plasma will be stored at&#xD;
      -80 degrees C until analysis. The urine samples will be stored at -80 degrees C until&#xD;
      analysis. After two 7-day washout period, the process will be repeated with each group&#xD;
      switching over to the other treatment, that is, the group that received treatment A will take&#xD;
      treatment B or C and the group that received treatment B will take treatment A or C, the&#xD;
      group that received treatment C will take treatment A or B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Berberine and dihydroberberine in blood exist in nonconjugate free form. A major metabolite&#xD;
      berberrubine exists in free form and phase II metabolites including sulfates and glucuronide.&#xD;
      In order to analyze berberrubine in all forms, a portion of plasma or urine will be treated&#xD;
      with Î²-glucuronidase from Helix pomatia to hydrolyze its sulfate/glucuronides. Berberine and&#xD;
      berberrubine will be extracted from plasma or urine with or without enzyme treatment using&#xD;
      solvent or solid phase extraction. The compounds' concentration will be determined using&#xD;
      HPLC-ESI-MS/MS method. Pharmacokinetic parameters such as area under the plasma concentration&#xD;
      time curve (AUC), peak concentration (Cmax), time at peak concentration (Tmax), and&#xD;
      elimination half time (T1/2) will be calculated for berberines, free berberrubine, and total&#xD;
      berberrubine. Relative absorption will be expressed as the ratio of calculated AUC's.&#xD;
