      The Wellness Champions for Change (WCC) study aims to reduce pediatric obesity among students&#xD;
      who attend schools in Maryland by training teacher and student-led wellness teams to increase&#xD;
      opportunities for physical activity and healthy eating at school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study uses a cluster randomized design to allocate 6 schools (3 elementary, 3 middle) in&#xD;
      5 school systems to one of 3 arms: &quot;A&quot; (teacher and student training), &quot;B&quot; (teacher training&#xD;
      only), and &quot;C&quot;) (delayed teacher training/control). Approximately 36 3rd/6th graders and&#xD;
      their caregivers (&quot;evaluation cohort&quot;), 15 4th/7th graders (&quot;student leaders&quot;), and 20&#xD;
      teachers from each school will be recruited in the spring before the intervention. All&#xD;
      schools will identify a teacher &quot;Wellness Champion&quot; who will coordinate intervention&#xD;
      activities. In &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; schools, wellness champions will attend a training to learn how to&#xD;
      build a wellness team and create more opportunities for students to make healthy choices. In&#xD;
      &quot;A&quot; schools, student leaders (&quot;Student Wellness Champions&quot;) will meet weekly during lunch&#xD;
      with a health educator to receive training as peer leaders and help the Wellness Champion&#xD;
      with wellness initiatives. Student leaders in &quot;B&quot; and &quot;C&quot; schools will receive a monthly&#xD;
      general Adolescent Health Curriculum. To assess the impact of the teacher and student-led&#xD;
      interventions, the evaluation cohort will be followed for 2.5 years, with measures including:&#xD;
      anthropometry (height/weight), 7-day accelerometry (physical activity), and validated&#xD;
      questionnaires to assess healthy eating. Student leaders will be followed for 1.5 years to&#xD;
      assess the impact of their participation, with measures including: anthropometry, 7-day&#xD;
      accelerometry, validated questionnaires to assess healthy eating, and validated&#xD;
      questionnaires and focus groups to assess leadership/advocacy skills. Teachers will complete&#xD;
      validated questionnaires to investigate their perceptions of the school environment,&#xD;
      classroom practices, and role modeling skills. Prior to data collection and analysis,&#xD;
      participants will be assigned an identification number, and all documents linking participant&#xD;
      information to identification numbers will be locked/ password-protected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The long-term goal of this project is to create health promoting school environments that&#xD;
      support healthy growth and development of children in order to prevent obesity. The approach&#xD;
      for creating health promoting school environments involves the school-level implementation of&#xD;
      existing Local Wellness Policies (LWPs). Implementation science suggests that policy&#xD;
      implementation may occur through diffusion (&quot;letting it happen&quot;), dissemination (&quot;helping it&#xD;
      happen&quot;), or implementation (&quot;making it happen&quot;). Since LWPs were initially mandated in 2006,&#xD;
      most school systems have relied on a diffusion or dissemination approach to LWP&#xD;
      implementation, leading to limited implementation on the school-level. We propose a&#xD;
      school-level LWP implementation strategy (&quot;making it happen&quot;) that relies on&#xD;
      educating/training teachers and students to be wellness champions. Through this proposed&#xD;
      study, the impact of a school-level intervention to enhance LWP implementation (WCC) and the&#xD;
      added benefit of training students to be wellness champions (WCC-students, &quot;WCC-S&quot;) on&#xD;
      student-level outcomes [diet, physical activity (PA), and obesity] will be examined through a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives are presented at the student and student wellness champion level:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the impact of a school-based intervention (&quot;Wellness Champions for&#xD;
      Change&quot; (WCC)) to enhance implementation of LWPs, on health behaviors (diet and PA) and&#xD;
      weight status of elementary and middle school students through a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: WCC will have a positive impact on health behaviors of students, compared to&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To examine the added impact of a student-led school-based intervention (&quot;Wellness&#xD;
      Champions for Change-Students&quot; (WCC-S) on health behaviors (diet and PA) and weight status of&#xD;
      elementary and middle school students through a randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: WCC+WCC-S will have a greater impact on health behaviors of students, compared&#xD;
      to WCC and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To examine factors in the home and school-neighborhood environments that moderate the&#xD;
      impact of WCC/WCC-S on health behavior (diet and PA) and weight status change of&#xD;
      elementary/middle school students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Students living in a moderately health-promoting home and school-neighborhood&#xD;
      environment will experience a greater change in health behaviors when exposed to WCC or&#xD;
      WCC+WCC-S compared to students in high or low health-promoting environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To examine the reach and fidelity of WCC and WCC-S when disseminated via eXtension&#xD;
      through an online continuing education credit model for teachers and a toolkit for students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: WCC and WCC-S dissemination schools will experience positive changes in LWP&#xD;
      implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Student Wellness Champion Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One part of our study involves developing a Student Wellness Champions curriculum (WCC-S&#xD;
      group) to train 5th and 8th graders in diverse schools across Maryland to make policy and&#xD;
      environmental changes that create a &quot;health-promoting environment&quot; in their schools. We plan&#xD;
      to evaluate individual and organizational outcomes for the 5th and 8th grade student wellness&#xD;
      champions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To assess the individual effectiveness of WCC-S to improve student wellness champions&#xD;
      youth advocacy, health literacy and public health literacy constructs, and changes in diet&#xD;
      and physical activity behaviors and/or weight status compared to control students.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To asses organizational effectiveness of WCC-S to improve school level LWP&#xD;
      implementation and environmental change compared to control or WCC-only schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To describe reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance factors including- reach&#xD;
      and representativeness of student champions, extent to which the intervention reaches other&#xD;
      students in WCC-S schools, representativeness of adopting schools compared to non-adopting&#xD;
      schools, implementation fidelity, barriers and challenges of implementation of training and&#xD;
      goal achievement, which intervention aspects (if any) are institutionalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A portion of participating schools will receive a Student Wellness Champion curriculum,&#xD;
      training for their wellness team, as well as technical assistance provided by a Wellness&#xD;
      Specialist (WCC-S Group). Other participating schools will only receive the training and&#xD;
      technical assistance (WCC Group) and some will solely receive resources (Control Group). The&#xD;
      process to determine which school receives which intervention is completely random, and will&#xD;
      not be decided until after baseline data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the spring prior to the intervention, all participating schools will be asked to select a&#xD;
      group of about 15 students (4th graders in elementary schools, 7th graders in middle schools)&#xD;
      to be a part of a Health Leader group that begins the following year (when the same students&#xD;
      are 5th graders in elementary, 8th graders in middle school). Students can either be&#xD;
      nominated by teachers or write a few sentences on why the student thinks it is important to&#xD;
      make his/her school a healthier place. At the beginning of the next school year, the health&#xD;
      leaders that attend schools randomized to WCC-S will become Student Wellness Champions. These&#xD;
      students will meet with a Wellness Specialist (member of our project team) once a week during&#xD;
      lunch to receive a health education/ health literacy curriculum in order to be well-versed on&#xD;
      the importance of being active and eating healthy foods, and how to communicate health&#xD;
      information to key stakeholders (administration and teachers) to enact policy change and to&#xD;
      fellow students to enact behavior change. These students will work with the Wellness&#xD;
      Specialist and staff members from their school to implement wellness policies and practices.&#xD;
      Health leaders that attend schools randomized to the WCC or control schools will remain&#xD;
      Health Leaders, and will have the opportunity to participate in an Adolescent Health&#xD;
      Curriculum, taught by the Wellness Specialist, during their 5th or 8th grade year. These&#xD;
      students will meet once a month, during lunch, and the curriculum will focus on general&#xD;
      public health topics including dental health, stress management and hygiene. At the end of&#xD;
      the year, participants will also have the opportunity to participate in a public health&#xD;
      leadership workshop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Schools randomized to WCC-S and WCC will select a teacher to become the Wellness Champion&#xD;
      (WC). This person may be a teacher or other school leader (nurse, counselor, etc.) who is&#xD;
      passionate about creating a healthy school environment. The wellness champions will attend a&#xD;
      Wellness Champions for Change training prior to the start of the intervention. During the&#xD;
      training, the Wellness Champion will work with a Wellness Specialist to set achievable LWP&#xD;
      implementation goals and design a plan for implementing those goals over the academic year.&#xD;
      Furthermore, this training will equip the Wellness Champion to build a school-level wellness&#xD;
      team, assess the school's wellness environment, develop, monitor, and report a school LWP&#xD;
      action plan, and conduct wellness activities that align with the LWP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the training, the Wellness Champion will work with the school's wellness team to&#xD;
      develop and implement a school LWP action plan. All Wellness Champions in a given school&#xD;
      system will meet monthly, as a group, with the Wellness Specialist to discuss progress,&#xD;
      pitfalls, and successes (bi-monthly in-person and/or bi-monthly by phone). In addition, all&#xD;
      Wellness Champions will receive year-long technical assistance from the Wellness Specialist&#xD;
      that focuses on implementing and monitoring LWP's at the school-level. The WCC intervention&#xD;
      will formally last for one school year, with schools continually followed for an additional&#xD;
      year to assess sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure the success of the intervention, evaluations on a group of 36 students&#xD;
      from all participating schools will be conducted (recruited as 3rd grade students in&#xD;
      elementary school and 6th grade students in middle schools). These students will become&#xD;
      members of the Evaluation Cohort, and will be asked to be followed for 2.5 years.&#xD;
