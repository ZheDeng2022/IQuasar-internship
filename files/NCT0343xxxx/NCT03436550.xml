  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether new multiparametric magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging (MRI) methods (including diffusion-weighted MRI, dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, MR&#xD;
      elastography and phase-contrast imaging) can be useful in assessing liver damage and degree&#xD;
      of portal hypertension (a complication of advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis) secondary to&#xD;
      chronic liver disease, compared to ultrasound measurement of liver stiffness [acoustic&#xD;
      radiation force impulse (ARFI) ultrasound] and routine blood tests. MRI uses magnetic fields&#xD;
      to look at soft tissues in the body. This study will ultimately help to determine whether&#xD;
      these methods will be useful in identifying liver disease and their complications that cannot&#xD;
      be well-understood using current liver MRI techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Liver cirrhosis has been historically classified as a single histopathologic entity, as it is&#xD;
      considered to be the latest fibrosis stage; however it is well known that cirrhosis&#xD;
      encompasses different degrees of clinical severity. Advanced liver fibrosis and cirrhosis are&#xD;
      commonly associated with portal hypertension, which is due to increased hemodynamic&#xD;
      resistance of the liver leading to an increase in portal venous pressure. Portal hypertension&#xD;
      leads to the development of esophageal varices associated with a high risk of bleeding,&#xD;
      ascites and renal dysfunction. The definite diagnosis of portal hypertension is based on the&#xD;
      measurement hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG), which is an indirect measure of portal&#xD;
      pressure. This technique is invasive and not widely available. Portal hypertension may also&#xD;
      be associated with a decrease in portal venous flow/velocity due to a higher parenchymal&#xD;
      resistance to flow, and an increase in hepatic arterial flow secondary to an arterial buffer&#xD;
      response that can be measured with phase-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). According&#xD;
      to the researcher's recent data, the increased vascular pressure observed in portal&#xD;
      hypertension affects liver and spleen stiffness as well as other viscoelastic properties&#xD;
      measured with advanced 3D MR elastography, which may potentially be used as biomarkers of&#xD;
      portal hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this proposal, the researchers would like to validate noninvasive imaging biomarkers based&#xD;
      on a short multiparametric MRI protocol for the quantification of changes in viscoelastic&#xD;
      properties and flow metrics in the liver and spleen in relation to portal hypertension. This&#xD;
      protocol could potentially be integrated in routine clinical MRI exams, and could&#xD;
      significantly reduce the cost of care by decreasing the need for HVPG measurement, upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal endoscopies, and could provide a novel risk stratification scoring system of&#xD;
      liver disease and portal hypertension based on MRI. This will be a highly significant&#xD;
      progression in patients with liver disease.&#xD;
