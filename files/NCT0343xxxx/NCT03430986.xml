    <measure>Volume Change From Baseline in the Nose Area</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Last value prior to treatment for the treatment group and last value prior to randomization for control group) to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>Volume of the nose was calculated by digital analysis of each participant's 3-dimensional (3D) images. A mixed-effects model for repeated measures (MMRM) was used for analysis. A positive change from Baseline indicates improvement. An analysis model was created by Canfield Scientific, only volume changes are available. Actual Baseline values are not available.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Where the Evaluating Investigator Noted &quot;Improved&quot; or &quot;Much Improved Using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The Evaluating Investigator assessed the aesthetic improvement of the nose using the GAIS 5-point scale where: 2=much improved, 1=improved, 0=no change, -1=worse and -2=much worse. The percentage of participants who the Evaluating Investigator assessed as 2=much improved or 1=improved is reported.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Noted &quot;Improved&quot; or &quot;Much Improved&quot; as Assessed by the Participant Using the GAIS in the Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The participant assessed the aesthetic improvement of the nose using the GAIS 5-point scale where: 2=much improved, 1=improved, 0=no change, -1=worse and -2=much worse. The percentage of participants who assess themselves as 2=much improved or 1=improved is reported.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Noted &quot;Satisfied&quot; or &quot;Very Satisfied&quot; With Treatment Outcome on the Nose Satisfaction Scale (NSS) in the Treatment Group</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The participant used the 5-point NSS to assess the treatment outcome of the nose where: +2=very satisfied, +1=satisfied, 0=neutral (neither satisfied or dissatisfied), -1=dissatisfied and -2= very dissatisfied. The percentage of participants who assessed themselves as +2=Very Satisfied or +1=Satisfied is reported.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (AEs) in the Control Period</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a patient or a participant using an investigational drug, whether or not considered related to the medicinal product. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease (new or exacerbated) temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is not satisfied with his/her aesthetic appearance due to structural features of&#xD;
             his/her nose and assessed as either &quot;dissatisfied&quot; or &quot;very dissatisfied&quot; by using the&#xD;
             5-point Nose Satisfaction Scale (NSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requires a total volume of at least 0.5 mL but not exceeding 3.0 mL of VOLUMA with&#xD;
             Lidocaine for initial and touch-up treatment combined, and treatment to the nasal&#xD;
             dorsum is mandatory to achieve an aesthetic improvement in the subject's nose&#xD;
             appearance, in the Treating Investigator (TI's) opinion&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a reasonable treatment goal for aesthetic improvement in nose, in the TI's&#xD;
             opinion. Participant and TI have aligned the treatment goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a small, shallow nose such that the volume of filler implant needed to create the&#xD;
             desired dorsal height is in excess of the ability of the skin and soft tissue to&#xD;
             expand and accommodate the implant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is on a concurrent regimen of lidocaine or structurally-related local anesthetics (eg,&#xD;

             C or Vitamin E or herbal supplements with garlic, gingko biloba, or ginseng) known to&#xD;
             increase coagulation time, or is currently menstruating (study treatment may be&#xD;
             delayed as necessary to accommodate menstrual period cessation and/or anticoagulation&#xD;
             washout interval)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has participated in any clinical trials within 4 weeks prior to signing the informed&#xD;
