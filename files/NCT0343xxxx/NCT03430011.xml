  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, multicenter, Phase 1/2 study to determine the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      JCARH125, a CAR T-cell product that targets B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA), in adult&#xD;
      subjects with relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma. The study will include a Phase 1&#xD;
      part to determine the recommended dose of JCARH125 in subjects with relapsed and/or&#xD;
      refractory multiple myeloma, followed by a Phase 2 part to further evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of JCARH125 at the recommended dose. The safety and tolerability of JCARH125 in&#xD;
      subjects who receive prophylactic treatment with anakinra will be evaluated in a separate&#xD;
      Phase 1 cohort. The antitumor activity of JCARH125 in subjects who have been previously&#xD;
      treated with BCMA-directed therapy will be evaluated in separate Phase 2a cohorts.&#xD;
