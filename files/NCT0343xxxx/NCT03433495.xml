  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was conducted in three phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first phase involved creation of a Spanish adaptation of the Melodic Intonation therapy;&#xD;
      the second phase consisted of a pilot non-randomized intervention study to analyse its&#xD;
      feasibility for use with 4 Spanish patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia; the third&#xD;
      phase consisted of a pilot randomised, crossover, intervention pilot trial in a different set&#xD;
      of patients with poststroke nonfluent aphasia (N=20)&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients diagnosed with nonfluent aphasia due to unilateral stroke in the left hemisphere&#xD;
        without neuroimaging evidence of lesions in the right hemisphere who fulfilled the&#xD;
        following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The time elapsed since the stroke exceeded 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient had received a standard program of conventional speech therapy after stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persistent nonfluent aphasia with the following characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Severely restricted language, which might be limited to meaningless stereotypy;&#xD;
                  unlike that observed in verbal tasks, the patient might produce some real and&#xD;
                  relevant words when singing familiar songs.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Poor repetition, even for single words.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Moderately preserved language comprehension.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The nonstereotyped language was produced with a slurring of speech.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The total score for the repetition did not exceed the 70th percentile in the&#xD;
                  Boston Diagnostic Aphasia Examination. The score was obtained from the average&#xD;
                  score in three areas: repetition of words and repetition of phrases; listening&#xD;
                  comprehension exceeding the 15th percentile of Boston Diagnostic Aphasia&#xD;
                  Examination; and from the average score obtained in three areas: word&#xD;
                  comprehension, commands and complex ideational material.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient was motivated, emotionally stable and had good attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent was provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients with a history of a previous stroke other than the index event or with any&#xD;
             clinical condition (e.g., short life expectancy, coexisting disease) or other&#xD;
             characteristics that precluded appropriate follow-up in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  patients participating in any therapeutic intervention clinical trials evaluating&#xD;
             poststroke recovery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  use of psychotropic drugs that interfere with patient evaluation.&#xD;
