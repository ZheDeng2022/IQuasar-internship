    <textblock>
      Delirium is a neurobehavioural syndrome that frequently develops in the postoperative and/or&#xD;
      ICU setting. The incidence of elderly patients who develop delirium during hospital stay&#xD;
      ranges from 11-82%. Delirium was first described more than half a century ago in the cardiac&#xD;
      surgery population, where it was already discovered as a state that might be accompanied by&#xD;
      serious complications such as prolonged ICU and hospital stay, reduced quality of life and&#xD;
      increased mortality. Furthermore, the duration of delirium is associated with worse long-term&#xD;
      cognitive function in the general ICU population. This long-term experience with delirium&#xD;
      suggests a high socioeconomic liability and has been a focus of many studies. The&#xD;
      aforementioned consequences of delirium are observed in all of three subtypes: hypoactive,&#xD;
      hyperactive, and mixed. Pharmacological treatment options for hypoactive delirium are&#xD;
      lacking. Since patients in hypoactive delirium suffer from disturbed circadian rhythm, the&#xD;
      investigators suggest that the administration of melatonin as a promising possibility in&#xD;
      these patients to shorten delirium duration and to lower its severity. Previous&#xD;
      investigations confirmed loss of melatonin rhythm in patients that had developed delirium&#xD;
      thus reasoning the study hypothesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this randomized study, the investigators aim to test the hypothesis that the reinstitution&#xD;
      of a normal circadian rhythm by the administration of melatonin compared to placebo after&#xD;
      diagnosis of hypoactive delirium, decreases the duration of delirium and reduces the&#xD;
      transmission to a form of agitated delirium. The administration might have to be repeated&#xD;
      several times to achieve resolution of delirium.&#xD;

      Delirium is a neurobehavioural syndrome that frequently develops in the postoperative and/or&#xD;
      ICU setting. The incidence of elderly patients who develop delirium during hospital stay&#xD;
      ranges from 10-80%. Delirium was first described more than half a century ago in the cardiac&#xD;
      surgery population, where it was already discovered as a state that might be accompanied by&#xD;
      serious complications such as prolonged ICU and hospital stay, reduced quality of life and&#xD;
      increased mortality. Furthermore, the duration of delirium is associated with worse long-term&#xD;
      cognitive function in the general ICU population. This long-term experience with delirium&#xD;
      suggests a high socioeconomic liability and has been a focus of many studies. Due to the&#xD;
      multifactorial origin of delirium, there are several but no incontestable options for&#xD;
      prevention and symptomatic treatment. Overall, delirium represents a high burden not only for&#xD;
      the patient and his/her family members, but also for the medical care team that aims to&#xD;
      prevent postoperative delirium to avoid serious consequences associated with it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aforementioned consequences of delirium are observed in all of three subtypes:&#xD;
      hypoactive, hyperactive, and mixed. Many studies have been conducted to prevent and treat&#xD;
      hyperactive and mixed delirium. Hypoactive delirium, suggested to be the most frequent form&#xD;
      of delirium, is a different case: as it corresponds to a patient that is calm and as such&#xD;
      doesn't cause any harm or inconvenience to himself or the caring medical team it also leads&#xD;
      to two major problems. First, it is already known that hypoactive delirium is hard to detect.&#xD;
      Second, because hypoactive delirious patients are calm or even asleep most of the time this&#xD;
      delirium subtype doesn't go along with the same urge to become active in order to prevent&#xD;
      harm. Also, pharmacological treatment usually addresses hyperactive and mixed delirium in&#xD;
      standard operating procedures, whereas treatment of hypoactive delirium remains supportive.&#xD;
      Pharmacological treatment options for hypoactive delirium are lacking. Since patients in&#xD;
      hypoactive delirium suffer from disturbed circadian rhythm, investigators suggest that the&#xD;
      administration of melatonin is a promising possibility in these patients to shorten delirium&#xD;
      duration and to lower its severity. Previous investigations confirmed loss of melatonin&#xD;
      rhythm in patients that had developed delirium thus reasoning the study hypothesis. Of note,&#xD;
      melatonin is to be investigated for ICU delirium prevention in an Australian study, as the&#xD;
      potential of chronotherapy to reduce delirium incidence has been suggested in a recently&#xD;
      published article. The administration of dexmedetomidine to treat the disturbed circadian&#xD;
      rhythm in hyperactive and mixed delirious ICU patients will be investigated in one of the&#xD;
      investigators' current studies, but because of its sedative nature it clearly doesn't&#xD;
      represent a treatment option for hypoactive delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the BOMP-AID trial is to assess the superiority of melatonin to placebo for the&#xD;
      treatment of hypoactive delirium in the ICU. The study hypothesis is based on the assumption&#xD;
      that melatonin compared to placebo (Lactose monohydrate, cellulose powder, magnesium stearate&#xD;
      (Ph. Eur.), mocrocristalline cellulose) administered at night restores a normal circadian&#xD;
      rhythm, thus decreasing the duration of delirium and reducing the transmission to a form of&#xD;
      agitated delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators would like to recruit 190 patients right after the diagnosis of hypoactive&#xD;
      delirium. The administration might have to be repeated several times to achieve resolution of&#xD;
      delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the first administration of melatonin or placebo at 8 p.m. investigators shall follow&#xD;
      the standard operating procedure for hypoactive delirium for further treatment of delirium&#xD;
      during daytime. In case of previously undiagnosed mixed delirium investigators are forced to&#xD;
      follow the standard operating procedure for mixed delirium that includes the administration&#xD;
      of haloperidol, quetiapine or trazodone. During the consecutive nightly hours the randomized&#xD;
      study substance will be administered again if indicated. The latter will allow investigators&#xD;
      to clearly detect the suggested shortening of delirium duration in the cohort where melatonin&#xD;
      is being used as treating agent. Any use of drugs to treat forms other than hypoactive will&#xD;
      be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure is delirium duration in shifts of 8 hours each. Due to difficult&#xD;
      diagnosis of hypoactive delirium, the investigators will consider those with an ICDSC score &gt;&#xD;
      2 (subsyndromal delirium) and Richmond Agitation Sedation Scale (RASS) score &lt; 0 in absence&#xD;
      of induced coma as eligible for study inclusion. If patients reveal an ICDSC score &gt; 2 and a&#xD;
      RASS score &lt; 0 a member of the study team will assess the patient according to DSM-V delirium&#xD;
      criteria REF] for definite study inclusion. The end of the delirium will be deÔ¨Åned as the end&#xD;
      of the last shift with an ICDSC &gt; 2 and a RASS score &lt; 0 that precedes a minimum of two&#xD;
      subsequent shifts with an ICDSC &lt; 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes can be listed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Delirium-free days at 28 days after study inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death until day 28, day 90, and day 365 from ICU admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of ventilator days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of ICU stay (hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of hospital stay (days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep quality, assessed by the Richards-Campbell Sleep Questionnaire (RCSQ; total score)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since melatonin has no known major side effects evidence of its way of function in the human&#xD;
      body strongly suggests high benefit for treatment of hypoactive delirium going along with&#xD;
      increased comfort and safety also for critically ill patients. No severe adverse events are&#xD;
      expected by its use in delirious patients after careful enrolment following investigators&#xD;
      exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following outcomes are measured by smartwatches. The smartwatches will be attached half&#xD;
      an hour before the administration of the drug (07:30 p.m.) and left attached as long as&#xD;
      possible, but at least until 6 a.m. of every day of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following smartwatch assessments are based on activity (counts/min):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep duration per night (minutes) defined as the period from lights off to lights on&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number of sleep interruptions (number of consecutive 5-min bouts of &gt;0 activity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The relative amplitude (RA) calculated from the ratio of the most active 10-hour period&#xD;
           (M10) to the least active 5-hour period (L5) across the averaged 24-hour profile&#xD;
           (assessment depends upon patient cooperation during the day with keeping the smartwatch&#xD;
           attached)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interdaily stability (IS), which quantifies the invariability day by day, that is, how&#xD;
           well the sleep-wake cycle is synchronized to supposedly stable environmental cues.&#xD;
           Timing information comes from determining the onset of the 5 hours with least activity&#xD;
           (L5 onset) and onset of the 10 hours with most activity (M10 onset).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, wrist/skin temperature (degrees/min) will be registered to assess degree of&#xD;
      relaxation (i.e., difference in degrees Celsius per minute between distal skin regions&#xD;
      (finger, feet etc) and proximal skin regions (clavicular, sternum etc).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess long-term follow-up of patients who received melatonin and compare it to those who&#xD;
      received placebo, we will perform a follow-up at three and twelve months after the prevailing&#xD;
      hospital case has been officially closed (discharge date). With this follow-up, we will&#xD;
      assess the following information equally at three and twelve months (information either given&#xD;
      by the patient or his/her family/contact person):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death after hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital readmission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Activities of Daily Living Questionnaire (ADLQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional episodes of delirium after study closeout&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRF assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On our electronic case report form, we will document the following information concerning our&#xD;
      study participants (sequential order):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient information including socioeconomic status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study eligibility&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results of the planned assessment tools&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cardiovascular parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lab values&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drugs administered&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nursing interventions&#xD;
