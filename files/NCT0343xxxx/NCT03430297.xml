  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is one phase Ⅲ, randomized, open-label study in comparison of JS001 with dacarbazine as&#xD;
      the 1st-line therapy for adult (≥18 years) subjects with unresectable or metastatic melanoma.&#xD;
      The subjects will be 1:1 randomized and stratified in accordance with acral lentiginous&#xD;
      melanoma and M stage (M0vsM1a/M1bvsM1c). Using standard dose and dose interval, the subjects&#xD;
      will be given JS001 240mg intravenously, once every two weeks, or dacarbazine 1000mg/m2, d1,&#xD;
      intravenously, once every three weeks. One cycle of therapy is 6 weeks (3 doses of JS001 or 2&#xD;
      doses of dacarbazine per cycle).&#xD;

      1. In the subjects who have clinical benefit evaluated by investigators and tolerate the&#xD;
           study treatment, treatment will be considered to give after occurrence of progression&#xD;
           defined by RECIST1.1 as evaluated by the initial investigators, these subjects must&#xD;
           terminate the treatment when further progression is validated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The subjects in dacarbazine treatment group are allowed to be crossed to receive JS001&#xD;
           after progression of disease; however, they need to be re-evaluated if they meet the&#xD;
           inclusion/exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects need to provide one tumor tissue specimen for archival or one newly acquired biopsy&#xD;
      tissue from the site that is previously not irradiated for evaluation of PD-L1 expression&#xD;
      status when they participate in the study. The PD-L1 expression status of specimen will be&#xD;
      evaluated in the central laboratory using immunohistochemical (IHC) method. Subjects with&#xD;
      positive or negative PD-L1 can be enrolled in this study, and the clinical activity in the&#xD;
      two subgroups will be evaluated in accordance with the prespecified subgroup analysis.&#xD;
