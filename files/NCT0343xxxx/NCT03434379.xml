    <time_frame>Randomization to the first occurrence of disease progression or death from any cause up to CCOD of 29Aug2019 (up to approximately 18 months)</time_frame>
    <description>TTD was defined as the time from randomization to the first deterioration (decrease from baseline of &gt;/= 10 points) in the patient-reported health-related global health status/quality of life (GHS /HRQoL), physical function or role function scales of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer quality-of-life questionnaire for cancer (EORTC) QLQ-C30, maintained for two consecutive assessments, or one assessment followed by death from any cause within 3 weeks.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events (AEs) in the China Population</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to end of study (up to approximately 40 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

        <title>Duration of Response by IRF Assessment (DOR-IRF) Per HCC mRECIST in the Global Population</title>
        <description>DOR was defined as the time interval from the date of first occurrence of a documented objective response (CR or PR, whichever status is recorded first) until the first date that disease progression (PD) or death was documented, whichever occurs first as determined by the IRF according to HCC mRECIST. HCC mRECIST differentiates between vital tumor and necrotic areas in the liver, measuring only the residual vital tumor mass in the liver CR: disappearance of all target lesions. PR: At least a 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of all target lesions, taking as reference the baseline sum of diameters, in the absence of CR. PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of &gt;/= 5 mm.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>

PD: at least a 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions, taking as reference the smallest sum of diameters on study (including baseline). In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum of diameters must also demonstrate an absolute increase of &gt;/= 5 mm.</description>

        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a subject administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events.</description>
