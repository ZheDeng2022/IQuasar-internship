  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will study digoxin to inhibit the hypoxic response in congenital&#xD;
      erythrocytosis due to germ line mutations that result in up-regulated hypoxia sensing. These&#xD;
      forms of congenital erythrocytosis, characterized by augmented levels of hypoxia inducible&#xD;
      factor (HIF)-1 and HIF-2, are due to mutations of VHL (von Hippel Lindau), EGLN1 (encoding&#xD;
      prolyl hydroxylase 2 [PHD2]) and EPAS1 (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)&#xD;
      (encoding HIF-2α). In addition to a high hematocrit, patients have thrombotic complications&#xD;
      and early mortality that are not improved by phlebotomy therapy. There is no effective&#xD;
      therapy. Digoxin, long used to treat congestive heart failure, is a potent inhibitor of the&#xD;
      master hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF-1. The study hypothesis is that&#xD;
      pharmacologic doses and levels of digoxin will decrease hemoglobin and hematocrit, decrease&#xD;
      need for phlebotomy, decrease the propensity to thrombosis and decrease pulmonary pressure in&#xD;
      patients with erythrocytosis due to up-regulated hypoxic responses. The clinical trial&#xD;
      consists of 24 weeks of digoxin therapy in patients with hypoxic response-related&#xD;
      erythrocytosis. The complete blood count, safety, symptoms of headache and lack of energy,&#xD;
      echocardiogram, physical performance, and plasma products and blood cell expression of&#xD;
      HIF-1-regulated genes are the outcome variables.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will investigate digoxin to inhibit the hypoxic response in congenital&#xD;
      erythrocytosis due to germ line mutations that result in up-regulated hypoxia sensing. These&#xD;
      forms of congenital erythrocytosis, characterized by augmented levels of hypoxia inducible&#xD;
      factor (HIF)-1 and/or HIF-2, are due to mutations of VHL (von Hippel Lindau), EGLN1 (encoding&#xD;
      prolyl hydroxylase 2 [PHD2]) and EPAS1 (endothelial PAS domain-containing protein 1)&#xD;
      (encoding HIF-2α). In addition to a high hematocrit, patients have thrombotic complications&#xD;
      and early mortality that are not improved by phlebotomy therapy. There is no effective&#xD;
      therapy. Digoxin, long used to treat congestive heart failure, is a potent inhibitor of the&#xD;
      master hypoxia-inducible transcription factor, HIF-1, and likely HIF-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VHL mutations- 15 known patients in the US, 55 in Western Europe, 150 in Chuvashia, in Ischia&#xD;
      and 11 in India.4 Chuvash erythrocytosis (CE), endemic in the Chuvash Republic of Russia and&#xD;
      the Italian island of Ischia, is due to homozygosity for a missense mutation of VHL (VHL&#xD;
      c.598C&gt;T; VHL R200W). VHL R200W impairs interactions of VHL with HIF-α subunits, reducing&#xD;
      their ubiquitin-mediated destruction. HIF-1 and HIF-2 heterodimers increase, leading to&#xD;
      increased expression of their target genes, including erythropoietin (EPO). In addition, CE&#xD;
      erythroid progenitors are hypersensitive to EPO, the explanation of which is not known. In&#xD;
      pilot studies this hypersensitivity is inhibited by digoxin. CE patients are prone to develop&#xD;
      thrombosis and early mortality that is independent of the increase in hematocrit. This&#xD;
      phenotype is different from the dominantly inherited VHL tumor predisposition syndrome&#xD;
      mutations that in combination with acquired somatic mutations result in tumorigenesis. Other&#xD;
      homozygous and compound heterozygous VHL mutations that cause erythrocytosis but not tumors&#xD;
      have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGLN1 (Egl-9 family hypoxia inducible factor 1) mutations- 5 patients in the US. and 21 in&#xD;
      Europe. PHD2 (encoded by the EGLN1 gene) is, along with VHL, a principal negative regulator&#xD;
      of HIFs. It targets HIF-α subunits for degradation. The first loss-of-function mutation of&#xD;
      PHD2 (PHD2 P317R) was identified in a family in which heterozygotes had mild or borderline&#xD;
      erythrocytosis. Since then, 25 additional patients with unexplained erythrocytosis who are&#xD;
      heterozygote carriers of different PHD2 mutations have been reported. Almost all patients&#xD;
      with PHD2-associated erythrocytosis have normal EPO levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPAS1 mutations- 20 known patients in the US and approximately 100 in Europe. Affected&#xD;
      patients have heterozygous missense mutations in the coding sequence of the EPAS1 gene&#xD;
      encoding HIF-2α that result in gain-of function of HIF-2 and elevated EPO levels. There is&#xD;
      heterogeneity in these gain-of-function EPAS1 mutations, but their existence supports the&#xD;
      critical role of HIF-2 in controlling the expression of renal EPO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digoxin as an agent to inhibit HIFs. Digoxin, a common and readily available FDA-approved&#xD;
      drug for treatment of congestive heart failure, was found to inhibit HIF-dependent gene&#xD;
      transcription by ~90% at a concentration of 0.4 μM; it also inhibits HIF-1α protein&#xD;
      translation and blocks HIF-1 activity in vivo. Doses of digoxin that prevent and treat murine&#xD;
      hypoxic pulmonary hypertension partially protect from hypoxia-induced erythrocytosis. These&#xD;
      doses lead to plasma digoxin levels in mice that are at or below the therapeutic range for&#xD;
      humans. In unpublished data, therapeutic doses of digoxin diminished exaggerated&#xD;
      erythropoiesis in vitro in a CE subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that pharmacologic doses and levels of digoxin will decrease&#xD;
      hemoglobin and hematocrit, decrease need for phlebotomy, decrease the propensity to&#xD;
      thrombosis and decrease pulmonary pressure in patients with erythrocytosis due to upregulated&#xD;
      hypoxic responses. The proposed study is conducted under IND138480 and is approved by the&#xD;
      FDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1. Determine if digoxin is safe and will decrease EPO, hemoglobin concentration and&#xD;
      pulmonary pressure in patients with congenital erythrocytosis due to up-regulated hypoxia&#xD;
      sensing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. Determine if digoxin will decrease purified blood cell lineage transcription and&#xD;
      reduce plasma levels of the products of pro-thrombotic genes up-regulated by the hypoxic&#xD;
      response, including IL1B (interleukin-1 beta), THBS1 (thrombospondin), EGR1 (early growth&#xD;
      response 1), NLRP3 (NLR family pyrin domain containing 3), SERPINE1 (serpin family E member&#xD;
      1), and F3 (tissue factor).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3. In a corollary study, determine if in vivo achievable digoxin concentrations abrogate&#xD;
      in vitro erythroid progenitor EPO hypersensitivity of mutations other than VHL R200W, and if&#xD;
      HIF-2α inhibitors (already in clinical trials) abrogate erythroid progenitor EPO&#xD;
      hypersensitivity alone or in combination with digoxin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, this proposal provides an unprecedented opportunity to identify inexpensive&#xD;
      therapy for rare forms of erythrocytosis due to up-regulated hypoxia sensing for which there&#xD;
      is now no safe, effective therapy. As such, this proposal fully coincides with the goals of&#xD;
      the FDA's Orphan Products Program. The research will also help define the role of hypoxia in&#xD;
      common maladies of mankind including chronic mountain sickness, obstructive sleep apnea, deep&#xD;
      vein thrombosis, cancer associated thrombosis and pulmonary hypertension.&#xD;
