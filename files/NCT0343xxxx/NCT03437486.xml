  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This a prospective, longitudinal study of first-degree family members of patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with familial interstitial pneumonia (FIP). FIP is the familial form of idiopathic pulmonary&#xD;
      fibrosis (IPF), which is defined as 2 or more bloodline relatives which have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (IIP). The most common form of idiopathic interstitial&#xD;
      pneumonia in FIP families is IPF (approximately 70%). The inheritance pattern in FIP is&#xD;
      consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance. Therefore,&#xD;
      individuals in this study have approximately 50% risk of carrying a disease-associated&#xD;
      allele. The causative gene is currently only known approximately 20% of families. The main&#xD;
      goal of this longitudinal study is to better establish the natural history of FIP and to&#xD;
      identify risk factors for later development of symptomatic disease. The investigators' plan&#xD;
      is to follow these at-risk individuals with yearly questionnaires and planned in person 5&#xD;
      year follow-ups through age 70 or until they develop symptomatic FIP.&#xD;

      Potential research subjects will be sent a questionnaire (modified version of the ATS-DLD-78&#xD;
      questionnaire) and study consent form. Individuals with no prior history of lung disease and&#xD;
      a dyspnea score of 2 or less will be offered the opportunity to undergo further research&#xD;
      evaluation, which will include HRCT scanning, pulmonary function testing (PFTs) and blood&#xD;
      draw. Subjects with grade 3 or greater dyspnea or findings of extensive disease on HRCT scan&#xD;
      (see below), will be recommended to undergo clinical diagnostic evaluation outside the study.&#xD;
      For those subjects that participate in this study, demographic information will be collected&#xD;
      and stored in a database, including past medical history, smoking history, medications, and&#xD;
      occupational and environmental exposure history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 5 year intervals after initial enrollment, subjects without clinical disease will be&#xD;
      offered a repeat HRCT scan and PFTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year after enrollment, the investigators will perform follow-up to ascertain whether&#xD;
      subjects have: 1) developed respiratory symptoms consistent with FIP/IPF, 2) undergone&#xD;
      additional diagnostic evaluations for lung disease, or 3) begun any new treatments for lung&#xD;
      disease. Subjects who have developed respiratory symptoms will be encouraged to seek medical&#xD;
      evaluation. For those who have undergone any new diagnostic testing or have been diagnosed&#xD;
      with FIP, study coordinators will seek permission to obtain HRCTs, medical records, pulmonary&#xD;
      function test results, and lung blocks for evaluation by investigators in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use standard criteria established by the ATS/ERS to guide the&#xD;
      diagnostic classification of patients who develop FIP. Information will be reviewed by a&#xD;
      pathologist, a radiologist, and 3 clinicians. In all cases, the clinicians make the final&#xD;
      diagnosis and after reviewing the clinical material (clinical/demographic data and pulmonary&#xD;
      physiology), and the radiology and pathology data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HRCT: A single prone HRCT scan without intravenous contrast will be performed and read by an&#xD;
      expert chest radiologist. He will assess the presence, extent, and distribution of areas of&#xD;
      ground-glass attenuation, interlobular reticular opacities, irregular thickening of&#xD;
      interlobular septa, traction bronchiectasis, and traction bronchiolectasis. The anatomic&#xD;
      distribution of each finding will be classified in each lung in one of 4 zones from apex to&#xD;
      base (upper, middle, lower, lowest). A score of 0 (absent), 1 (&lt;5%), or 2 (&gt;5% parenchymal&#xD;
      involvement) will be given for each descriptor in each lung zone based on visual estimation&#xD;
      (total score of 1-16). In addition, HRCT scans will be classified as: 1) normal, 2) abnormal,&#xD;
      consistent with early FIP, 3) abnormal, consistent with extensive disease, or 4) abnormal,&#xD;
      consistent with other diagnoses. Extensive disease is defined as &gt;5% honeycombing in &gt;2&#xD;
      zones. Other diagnoses could include suspicious lung nodules, extensive emphysema, or other&#xD;
      findings requiring clinical referral. Disease progression on HRCT is defined by an increase&#xD;
      in the total CT score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function testing: PFTs will include spirometry, lung volumes, and DLCO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen collection, processing, and banking: Each subject will have 20 ml blood collected on&#xD;
      enrollment and on the day of repeat HRCT. Lymphocytes will be saved for generation of&#xD;
      lymphoblastoid cells, DNA isolation, and telomere length analysis. Both serum and plasma will&#xD;
      be saved for further studies.&#xD;
