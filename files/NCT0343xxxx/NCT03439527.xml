  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The rising success of cell therapies places an increasing burden on health care costs.&#xD;
      Consequently, the need to reduce production costs while maintaining quality has been widely&#xD;
      acknowledged. In addition, the demand for high-quality products with an optimal safety&#xD;
      profile is increasing. The proposed cell treatment is the first therapeutical option with the&#xD;
      possibility to revert the underlying condition. The investigators expect that this healing&#xD;
      response will be achieved with minimal side effects justifying the addional costs and&#xD;
      complexity.&#xD;

      muscle precursor cells (MPCs) will be isolated from biopsies of the lower leg of patients,&#xD;
      seeded, expanded and cultivated in vitro in a GMP facility to generate vital muscle cells&#xD;
      dedicated for implantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These muscle cells exhibit myogenic phenotype (IHC and flow cytometry) and therefore&#xD;
      morphological and histological prerequisites approximating the properties of native skeletal&#xD;
      muscle tissue. The muscle progenitor cells shall be applied in external sphincter muscle for&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with stress urinary incontinence.&#xD;
