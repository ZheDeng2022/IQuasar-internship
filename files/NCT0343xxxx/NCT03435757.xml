  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To overcome the disadvantage of complex morphology and availability of less favorable support&#xD;
      to retention of graft and clot stabilization in 1-, 1-2-wall periodontal defects, it was&#xD;
      hypothesized that placement of CPS putty having the property of being easily moldable and&#xD;
      shaped along with decortication would provide better healing outcome as compared to&#xD;
      decortication alone in 1-, 1-2-wall periodontal defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore with this rationale, the present study is carried out to evaluate the treatment&#xD;
      outcomes of decortication with and without use of CPS putty in 1- wall, 1-2-wall periodontal&#xD;
      defects.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The definite goal of periodontal regenerative therapy is to restore the tooth supporting&#xD;
      tissues, lost as a result of inflammatory periodontal diseases and infections. Numerous&#xD;
      treatment modalities have been described and tested, including use of non resorbable and&#xD;
      resorbable membranes (GTR) ; autogenous bone grafts, bone allografts, xenografts and&#xD;
      synthetic materials, and bioactive molecules (EMD) and growth factors. Furthermore researches&#xD;
      on cell therapy and gene therapy utilization to boost the reparative potential of the wound&#xD;
      tissues are also being carried out. Each of the treatment modalities have their own&#xD;
      limitations and advantages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autogenous bone grafts having good osteogenic and osteoconductive capacity than other grafts&#xD;
      are considered to be the best but need for a second surgery, postoperative complaints and&#xD;
      insufficient amount of bone graft obtained restrict their use. Allografts and xenografts use&#xD;
      is also limited because of their controversial osteoinduction capability, ethical problems,&#xD;
      infections and immunological rejection risk. As a result of the varying disadvantages of the&#xD;
      auto-, allo- and xenografts, synthetic bone graft use is slowly increasing. These have&#xD;
      advantages of good osteoconductivity, no ethical or problems of infection and production of&#xD;
      these grafts can be unlimited. The disadvantages lies in their lack of osteogenic and&#xD;
      osteoinductive properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One such synthetic material is bioactive glass developed by Hench and West In late 1960s. It&#xD;
      is available in particulate as well as putty form. Calciumphosphosilicate (CPS) putty&#xD;
      (NOVABONE Dental Putty, Novabone products Pvt. Ltd., INDIA) is a new next generation bone&#xD;
      graft material built with bioactive glass platform with additives like polyethylene glycol&#xD;
      and glycerin to improve handling and efficiency. It is available as a premixed pliable&#xD;
      cohesive material. It's not only an osteoconductive material but also imparts&#xD;
      osteostimulative effect. CPS putty stimulates osteoblast recruitment, proliferation and&#xD;
      differentiation at the defect site and increases rate of bone formation throughout the&#xD;
      defect, simultaneously increasing the resorption rate of the graft material. Bembi et al.&#xD;
      reported that mean percentage change in amount of radiographic bone fill was more in the&#xD;
      treatment of intrabony defects with novabone putty as compared to calcified algae- derived&#xD;
      porous hydroxyapatite bone graft. In another study Biswas et al. concluded that use of&#xD;
      bioactive glass osteostimulative biomaterial yields superior clinical results, including&#xD;
      increased pocket depth reduction of class II furcation defects as compared to an autologous&#xD;
      platelet concentrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controversial reports have been reported on outcomes of healing in reference to number of&#xD;
      bony walls remaining. Therefore type of periodontal defect might influence the effect of&#xD;
      grafts and membrane on periodontal regeneration. Contained intrabony periodontal defects (3-&#xD;
      walled) offer a higher predictability in the regenerative procedures as compared to&#xD;
      non-contained infrabony periodontal defects (1-,2- wall defects) as the later morphology is&#xD;
      complex due to limited buccal and lingual periodontal tissue component. The one wall&#xD;
      periodontal defect offers less favorable support to the flap and clot stabilization,. Studies&#xD;
      have shown considerable variations of results as these defects have larger width (as compared&#xD;
      to 3-wall defects); osteoconductivity is difficult to obtain; blood supply to the gingival&#xD;
      flap at the graft site is insufficient and gingival recession tends to occur. Selvig et al.&#xD;
      reported that the percentage of 3-wall intrabony defect was less than 30% and a combination&#xD;
      of 1-wall and 2- wall defects was mainly observed. The prevalence of later is more hence&#xD;
      development of predictable periodontal regeneration holds a greater importance in these&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled study will be conducted in Department of Periodontics and Oral&#xD;
      Implantology, Post Graduate Institute of Dental Sciences, Rohtak.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited from regular outpatient department of the Department of&#xD;
      Periodontics and Oral Implantology and Department of Oral medicine, Diagnosis and Radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of a minimum of 36 systemically healthy patients aged 28 to&#xD;
      60 years with chronic periodontitis and having at least one tooth with non-contained&#xD;
      periodontal osseous defect (1-wall, 2-wall defect). In each patient, one non-contained bone&#xD;
      defect will be selected, in case of more than one defect, the defect which is at the deepest&#xD;
      in the radiographic and clinical examination will be selected, without stratification by&#xD;
      tooth type or location. Patients will be randomized into two groups (minimum 18 each) into&#xD;
      test and control group. Control group will undergo treatment with open flap debridement (OFD)&#xD;
      and intramarrow penetration (IMP) (OFD+IMP; control group) and test group OFD plus IMP plus&#xD;
      calcium phosphosilicate putty (CPS) (OFD+IMP+CPS; test group). Prior written informed consent&#xD;
      will be taken from all the participants after explaining the study objectives and procedures&#xD;
      in patient's own language.&#xD;
