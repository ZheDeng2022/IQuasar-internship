    <textblock>
      Utero-vaginal prolapse is a common, often disabling, condition experienced by women of&#xD;
      varying ages. The traditional surgical treatment for utero-vaginal prolapse often includes&#xD;
      vaginal hysterectomy and anterior or posterior colporrhaphy. Growing emphasis on&#xD;
      patient-centered medicine and patient-generated definitions of surgical success has resulted&#xD;
      in reassessment of uterine preservation versus hysterectomy at the time of apical POP repair.&#xD;
      Various techniques have been described for uterine preserving prolapse surgery, which may&#xD;
      include vaginal sacrospinous hysteropexy, transvaginal mesh kits, abdominal sacrohysteropexy&#xD;
      using mesh and laparoscopic uterine suspension using sling or mesh. A modified form of&#xD;
      uterine-preserving prolapse surgery using a combined vaginal and laparoscopic approach was&#xD;
      introduced and a series of 70 women was reported. To date, there have been no randomized&#xD;
      studies comparing the outcomes of vaginal assisted laparoscopic uterine suspension&#xD;
      (hysteropexy) with conventional vaginal hysterectomy. Women attending the gynecology clinic&#xD;
      at a tertiary referral urogynecology unit in tertiary referral training and research hospital&#xD;
      requesting surgical treatment for STAGE 2-4 symptomatic uterine prolapse will be offered&#xD;
      participation in a randomized trial, over a 2-year period. Subjects participating in the&#xD;
      study were randomly assigned to either of two groups: Group A, Vaginally Assisted&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Hysteropexy (VALH), or Group B, Vaginal Hysterectomy and Mc Call Culdoplasty (VH&#xD;
      + Mc Call).1 year following surgery, vaginal prolapse will be assessed again using the&#xD;
      International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire for Vaginal Symptoms (ICIQ-VS)&#xD;
      questionnaire and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse -Quantification (POP-Q) examination by another&#xD;

      Utero-vaginal prolapse is a common, often disabling, condition experienced by women of&#xD;
      varying ages. The traditional surgical treatment for utero-vaginal prolapse often includes&#xD;
      vaginal hysterectomy and anterior or posterior colporrhaphy. Growing emphasis on&#xD;
      patient-centered medicine and patient-generated definitions of surgical success has resulted&#xD;
      in reassessment of uterine preservation versus hysterectomy at the time of apical pelvic&#xD;
      organ prolapse (POP) repair. Comparison of study outcomes between hysteropexy and&#xD;
      hysterectomy are confounded by anatomic variables (isolated apical prolapse or multiple&#xD;
      compartment prolapse), hormonal status (premenopausal, postmenopausal on hormone therapy, and&#xD;
      postmenopausal without hormone therapy), and surgical approach (vaginal, open abdominal,&#xD;
      laparoscopic, and robotic). In addition, the number of women who subsequently undergo&#xD;
      hysterectomy after a uterus-sparing prolapse surgery is not known. With the caveat of these&#xD;
      limitations, new short-term data are available to inform consideration of uterine-sparing POP&#xD;
      repair. Various techniques have been described for uterine preserving prolapse surgery, which&#xD;
      may include vaginal sacrospinous hysteropexy, transvaginal mesh kits, abdominal&#xD;
      sacrohysteropexy using mesh and laparoscopic uterine suspension using sling or mesh. A&#xD;
      modified form of uterine-preserving prolapse surgery using a combined vaginal and&#xD;
      laparoscopic approach was introduced and a series of 70 women was reported.To date, there&#xD;
      have been no randomized studies comparing the outcomes of vaginal assisted laparoscopic&#xD;
      uterine suspension (hysteropexy) with conventional vaginal hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, randomized controlled study of two parallel groups. Women attending&#xD;
      the gynecology clinic at a tertiary referral urogynecology unit requesting surgical treatment&#xD;
      for STAGE 2-4 symptomatic uterine prolapse will be offered participation in a randomized&#xD;
      trial, over a 2-year period between February 2018 and February 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Requirements for women recruited are that&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  patients who are over 35 years of age with no desire to preserve fertility. (Subjects&#xD;
           had completed childbearing or were practicing reliable contraception)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have a normal size uterus (&lt;10 cm) on examination or ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  who agree to participate in principle will be given further information about the trial&#xD;
           and consent will be obtained either in an outpatient clinic or at the next visit for&#xD;
           preoperative assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will exclude women with&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cervical elongation (surgeon discretion),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prior mesh prolapse repair,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  current foreign-body complications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  increased risk or recent history of cervical dysplasia, chronic pelvic pain, significant&#xD;
           uterine abnormalities, and abnormal menstruation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postmenopausal bleeding in the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women with a significantly enlarged fibroid uterus or concomitant medical problems&#xD;
           precluding general anesthesia or the use of a steep Trendelenburg position Subjects&#xD;
           participating in the study will be randomly assigned to either of two groups: Group A,&#xD;
           Vaginally Assisted Laparoscopic Hysteropexy (VALH), or Group B, Vaginal Hysterectomy and&#xD;
           Vaginal Vault Suspension (VAH + VVS). Those recruited who subsequently have a strong&#xD;
           preference or either operation and consequently decline to continue in the study will be&#xD;
           excluded and will not randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VALH surgical procedure described below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure was performed under general anesthesia with the patient initially in the&#xD;
      lithotomy position. After insertion of a urinary catheter, a 2 cm transverse vaginal incision&#xD;
      was performed to the posterior cervix. The vaginal mucosa on the posterior cervix was&#xD;
      dissected and type 1 polypropylene mesh secured to the posterior cervix with six 2/0&#xD;
      polydioxanone sutures. After skin preparation, and draping, a pneumoperitoneum was created&#xD;
      and three laparoscopic ports were placed; 11 mm umbilical, 5 mm left and right lateral ports,&#xD;
      and 5 mm suprapubic port. The sacral promontory was subsequently visualized and the presacral&#xD;
      peritoneum was opened with monopolar diathermy and laparoscopic scissors.The tail end of the&#xD;
      mesh was then push forward to the promontorium in the retroperitoneal region under&#xD;
      laparoscopic visualisation. The end of the mesh grasped and pulled up laparoscopically. The&#xD;
      uterus pushed up to the using the uterine manipulator. The mesh was then tacked to the sacral&#xD;
      promontory with 5 mm helical fasteners. Finally, the mesh was completely covered with&#xD;
      peritoneum, gas was expelled and ports were withdrawn under vision. Skin incisions were&#xD;
      closed with absorbable fine sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of the operation allocation will be confirmed and appropriate consent will be&#xD;
      obtained for the specific surgical procedure. Vaginal hysterectomy + Mc Call Culdoplasty and&#xD;
      vaginal assisted laparoscopic hysteropexy will combined with anterior and/or posterior repair&#xD;
      depending on the judgment of the surgeon at the time of the operation. Each woman will be&#xD;
      followed up initially in the clinic 3 months post-surgery as part of the departmental&#xD;
      routine. Participants will then invite for review, as part of the trial, at a dedicated&#xD;
      clinic, 1 year following surgery. Vaginal prolapse will be assessed again using the&#xD;
      International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire for Vaginal Symptoms (ICIQ-VS)&#xD;
      questionnaire and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) examination by another&#xD;
      researcher then the operator. During the interview, further questions will be asked regarding&#xD;
      post-operative recovery, current urinary symptoms, Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form&#xD;
      (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7) and their satisfaction&#xD;
      with the operation. Subjective surgical outcome will be measured using the Patient Global&#xD;
      Impression of Improvement (PGI-I), which is a validated tool as a global index of response to&#xD;
      prolapse surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The women's prolapse symptoms and their impact will be evaluated before surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A subjective assessment of the prolapse will be made using the ICIQ-VS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Objective assessment of pelvic organ prolapse will be performed during a Valsalva&#xD;
           maneuver, in the left lateral position, using a Sims' speculum. Investigators use the&#xD;
           pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) system.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients will be also asked to complete the Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form&#xD;
           (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7). UDI-6 and IIQ-7&#xD;
           are accepted as validated questionnaires that are useful in the assessment of urogenital&#xD;
           symptoms and disease-specific QoL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measure for primary outcome is treatment failure defined as recurrent apical prolapse&#xD;
      surgery required within the first year post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcome measures are change in anatomy quantified by POP-Q and symptoms&#xD;
      quantified using the ICIQ-VS questionnaire scores for prolapse, sexual wellbeing, quality of&#xD;
      life, and PGI-I score, UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores. Other secondary outcome measures are operation&#xD;
      time, blood loss, hospital stay, and time before return to normal activity.&#xD;

    <description>The POP-Q system is an objective, site-specific system for describing and staging POP in women. The measurement is then taken of the distance from the point to the hymenal plane. Point C is defined as the most distal (ie, most dependent) edge of the cervix or the leading edge of the vaginal cuff (posthysterectomy). Preoperative and postoperative one year measurement of point C according to POP-Q system will be recorded and the change from preoperative measurement at postoperative first year is secondary outcome of this study.</description>

Point C is defined as the most distal (ie, most dependent) edge of the cervix or the leading edge of the vaginal cuff (posthysterectomy). Preoperative and postoperative one year measurement of point C according to POP-Q system will be recorded and the change from preoperative measurement at postoperative first year is secondary outcome of this study.</description>
