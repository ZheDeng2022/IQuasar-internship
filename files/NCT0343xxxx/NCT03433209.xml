      The effect of two different bipolar instruments were compared in terms of operative time,&#xD;
      total operative time, intra-operative blood loss and intra-operative and postoperative&#xD;
      complications. Devices included the LigaSure™ Maryland Jaw 5 mm laparoscopic instrument&#xD;
      (LigaSure; LF 1737, Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA) and ENSEAL™ G2 Articulating Straight 5mm&#xD;
      Tissue Sealer (ENSEAL; NSLG2S35A, Ethicon Endo-surgery, US, LLC).&#xD;

      This study is a single-center, single-blinded, randomized control trial that was conducted at&#xD;
      the University of Health Sciences Antalya Training and Research Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was single-blinded in that the patient was not informed of their group assignment;&#xD;
      it is impossible to blind the surgeon using the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were recruited from outpatient clinics and informed about the study before&#xD;
      enrollment. Women aged over 18 years scheduled for laparoscopic hysterectomy for benign&#xD;
      indications between June 2016 and November 2017 were included in the study after obtaining&#xD;
      written consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women who had given consent were randomized one day before surgery to one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: The Ligasure device used during the hysterectomy. Group 2: The articulating Enseal&#xD;
      device used during the hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able and willing to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Under 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Suspected malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All laparoscopic procedures were performed under general anesthesia. An experienced surgeon,&#xD;
      who has an experience of over 100 cases of TLH with both LigaSure and Enseal, performed all&#xD;
      the procedures. Because both devices have long been used in the operations, they are always&#xD;
      ready for use in our operation rooms. During the study, the first assistant was always a&#xD;
      second or a third year assistant surgeon and the second assistant holding the uterine&#xD;
      manipulator was a first year assistant surgeon. Operative time was recorded in minutes with a&#xD;
      digital watch by a first year resident by dictation of the primary surgeon of the start and&#xD;
      stop times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After positioning the patient in lithotomy position and placement of a Foley catheter, a Rumi&#xD;
      II (CooperSurgical, Inc, Trumbull, CT, USA) uterine manipulator with Koh cup (Bard Medical,&#xD;
      Covington, GA, USA) of appropriate size was placed. The first assistant stood on the right&#xD;
      side of the patient and held the camera. The second assistant held the uterine manipulator.&#xD;
      The abdominal cavity was entered by direct trocar insertion. The site of insertion varied,&#xD;
      being the umbilicus or Lee-Huang point, according to the size of the uterus. After&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum was obtained, the patient was positioned in the Trendelenburg position and&#xD;
      three additional trocars, all 5 mm in size, were inserted from both inguinal regions and&#xD;
      suprapubic region. Following exploration of the abdominal cavity, adhesiolysis was performed&#xD;
      where necessary. The round ligaments were sealed and transected, the bladder peritoneum was&#xD;
      opened, the utero-ovarian ligaments were sealed and cut, the bladder peritoneum was dissected&#xD;
      from the vagina, the uterine vessels were skeletonized, sealed and dissected followed by&#xD;
      sacro-uterine ligament dissection and finally the vaginal wall on the rim of the vaginal part&#xD;
      of the uterine manipulator was cut by Harmonic AceTM. The uterus was removed vaginally in all&#xD;
      operations but in case of large uteri, either a Chardonnen's morcellation knife (Karl Storz&#xD;
      GmBH, Tuttlingen, Germany) or a power morcellator was used for uterine section before&#xD;
      retrieval. The vaginal cuff was closed by laparoscopic stitching with number 1 Vicryl suture.&#xD;
      In cases where bilateral or unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy was also indicated, the&#xD;
      procedure was performed after removal of the uterus in order to prevent interference with&#xD;
      operative time which was our primary outcome measure. To seal and transect uterine&#xD;
      attachments, the LigaSure™ Maryland Jaw 5 mm laparoscopic instrument (LigaSure; LF 1737,&#xD;
      Covidien, Mansfield, MA, USA), using the ForceTriadTM Energy Platform (Covidien, Boulder, CO,&#xD;
      USA) was used in one group and ENSEAL™ G2 Articulating Straight 5mm Tissue Sealer (ENSEAL;&#xD;
      NSLG2S35A, Ethicon Endo-surgery, US, LLC) using the Ethicon GEN11TM generator (Ethicon&#xD;
      Endo-surgery, US, LLC) was used in the other group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up was performed on postoperative day 7, and then at 1 month.Patients were also seen&#xD;
      at our clinic if they developed symptoms between follow-up visits and complications recorded.&#xD;
