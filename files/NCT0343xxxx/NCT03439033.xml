  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study primarily comparing Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) alone to Positron&#xD;
      Emission Tomography (PET)/MRI using an experimental tracer, 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC, among men with&#xD;
      prostate cancer or prostatic cancer recurrence/metastasis. It is hypothesized that this&#xD;
      comparison will demonstrate that PET using the tracer, 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC, is more sensitive&#xD;
      than MRI alone. Potential subjects who cannot undergo MRI may undergo PET/CT instead.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-reader methodological study comparing the diagnostic value of&#xD;
      68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/CT or 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET/MRI over MRI alone, using histologic&#xD;
      confirmation or serial follow-up for up to 2 years as the gold standard for determination of&#xD;
      primary prostate cancer or prostatic cancer recurrence/metastasis. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      this will demonstrate the superiority of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET to MRI for sensitivity, and&#xD;
      the non-inferiority of 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC PET to MRI for specificity.This is a paired,&#xD;
      case-control design that is appropriate to statistically evaluate the difference in&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity between the two imaging modalities. Therefore, the estimation of&#xD;
      population prevalence is not a study objective, and estimation of clinical utility through&#xD;
      calculation of positive and negative predictive values is not appropriate. Imaging studies&#xD;
      and follow up subject scans will be organized so that a panel of independent readers will&#xD;
      evaluate the MRI and PET studies to assess the level of suspicion for prostate cancer.&#xD;
