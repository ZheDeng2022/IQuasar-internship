      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      New ways to study the brain as people move include near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) and&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG). NIRS uses laser light shone through the scalp to look at blood&#xD;
      flow in the brain which increases with movement. EEG records electrical activity in the&#xD;
      brain. Little is known about brain activity while children learn new motor skills.&#xD;
      Researchers want to learn more about how small children with and without cerebral palsy use&#xD;
      their brain to control their body. This may help them find new ways to help children move&#xD;
      better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn more about how infants and young children with and without cerebral palsy use their&#xD;
      brain to move their arms and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children ages 3 months - 5 years with and without cerebral palsy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questions for the parents about the child s health&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have at least 1 study session. Some may have up to 34 (all optional).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the sessions, participants will do motor tasks along with some or all of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Light sensors placed on the scalp, held there with a cap or Velcro straps.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Small metal disks placed on the scalp with a cap or straps, with gel between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Motion capture recording. Balls attached to the arms and legs by stickers, straps, or a&#xD;
           garment are tracked by infrared and video cameras.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor tasks include reaching, clapping, kicking, and standing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be placed in a toy or device that uses a motor to move their limbs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants head size, hair, and skin will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will answer questions about their child s typical movements.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portable neural imaging during functional tasks is now possible utilizing noninvasive&#xD;
      near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) which identifies areas of brain activity by measuring blood&#xD;
      flow dynamics and electroencephalography (EEG) which measures electrical activity on the&#xD;
      cortical surface. Use of these technologies for studying movement is rapidly increasing;&#xD;
      however, investigations in children and those with neurological disorders such as cerebral&#xD;
      palsy (CP) or autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are still in the early stages with few reports&#xD;
      in the literature. The objectives of this protocol are to systematically compare cortical&#xD;
      activation patterns during specified sensorimotor tasks in infants and young children with&#xD;
      typical development (TD) to those with and at high-risk for CP and ASD, examine developmental&#xD;
      changes in brain activation patterns that underlie the emergence of early functional or&#xD;
      dysfunctional motor control and explore the neural and biomechanical effects of different&#xD;
      devices that make movement easier for infants and toddlers with CR and ASD. The results are&#xD;
      expected to increase knowledge of brain activation patterns across tasks in groups with and&#xD;
      without neurological disorders and to suggest potential mechanisms or strategies for future&#xD;
      clinical intervention trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The group with CP (including all infants less than 18 months who are identified as being at&#xD;
      high-risk for CP) will consist of up to 100 children ages 3 months up to 5 years of age. The&#xD;
      group with ASD (including all infants less than 3 years of age who are identified as being at&#xD;
      high-risk for ASD) will consist of up to 100 children ages 3 months up to 5 years of age. The&#xD;
      control group will consist of up to 100 children with TD within the same age range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study that will include cross-sectional and longitudinal data&#xD;
      collection. NIRS and/or EEG responses, and kinematic and/or kinetic, force plate, wearable&#xD;
      sensors, and/or electromyography (EMG) recordings will be collected on all participants&#xD;
      during the performance of self-initiated motor tasks. Additionally, we will evaluate brain&#xD;
      and motor responses to devices that aim to make movement easier for infants and children who&#xD;
      may have difficulty initiating or performing these movements without assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes are the magnitude, extent and location of brain activity recorded by NIRS&#xD;
      and/or EEG within tasks across subject groups. We will also quantify changes in brain&#xD;
      activation across ages (cross-sectional) and time (longitudinal). Secondary outcomes may&#xD;
      include motion, force plate, wearable sensors, and EMG data to help interpret task and group&#xD;
      differences and measures of motor abilities. The same outcome measures will be compared&#xD;
      across ages to examine the development of cortical activation patterns and motor abilities&#xD;
      and how these change over time and across groups with and without neurological disorders.&#xD;
