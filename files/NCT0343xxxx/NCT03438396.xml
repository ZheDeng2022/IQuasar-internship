      A Single arm, Multicenter, International Trial of Tisotumab Vedotin (HuMax®-TF-ADC) in&#xD;
      Previously Treated, Recurrent or Metastatic Cervical Cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the trial is to evaluate the efficacy and safety/tolerability of tisotumab&#xD;
      vedotin in patients with previously treated, recurrent or metastatic cervical cancer.&#xD;
      Tisotumab vedotin is an antibody-drug conjugate (ADC) targeting tissue factor (TF), a protein&#xD;
      aberrantly expressed in a wide number of tumors including cervical cancer. Preliminary safety&#xD;
      and efficacy data observed in a cohort of previously treated cervical cancer patients suggest&#xD;
      a positive benefit risk profile for this population of high unmet need.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response (OR) as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 through IRC verified disease progression, initiation of new anticancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death, whichever occurred first (approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The confirmed OR is defined as best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) based upon RECIST v1.1, assessed by the IRC. The CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. A confirmed CR is 2 CRs (CR-CR sequence) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. The PR is &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesion. A confirmed PR is PR-PR sequence or PR-CR sequence that were separated by at least 4 weeks. The intermediate missing (Not Evaluable [NE]) scan evaluations between response scan and confirmation scan were allowed, eg, PR-NE-PR and PR-NE-NE-PR was considered PR confirmed (a repeat scan not earlier than 4 weeks after initial scan documenting response). 95% CI was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Duration of Response (DOR) as Assessed by the IRC</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 1 through IRC verified disease progression, initiation of new anticancer therapy, study withdrawal, or death, whichever occurred first (approximately 20 months)</time_frame>
    <description>The DOR is defined as the duration from the first documented response of CR or PR (the start date of response, not the date when response was confirmed) to the date of the first documented progression disease (PD) verified by IRC or death. Based upon RECIST v1.1, the CR is defined as disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions; the PR is defined as &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesion; and the PD is defined as at least 20% increase in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline), unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions, and/or new lesion. The DOR was estimated using Kaplan-Meier method.</description>

    <description>The TTR is defined as the duration from the start of study drug to the first documented response of either CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1, assessed by the IRC. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs (&gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesion) or an un-confirmed PR and an un-confirmed CR or achieved PR-NE-PR or PR-NE-NE-PR that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. A SAE is defined as an AE that meets one of the following criteria: fatal or life-threatening; results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity; constitutes a congenital anomaly/birth defect; medically significant (an event that jeopardizes the participant or may require medical or surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes listed above [medical and scientific judgment must be exercised in deciding whether an AE is &quot;medically important&quot;]); required inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization. A TEAE is defined as an AE occurring or worsening between the first dose of tisotumab vedotin and 30 days after the last dose received.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Confirmed Objective Response (OR) as Assessed by the Independent Review Committee (IRC)</title>
        <description>The confirmed OR is defined as best overall response of confirmed complete response (CR) or confirmed partial response (PR) based upon RECIST v1.1, assessed by the IRC. The CR is disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions. A confirmed CR is 2 CRs (CR-CR sequence) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. The PR is &gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions (compared to baseline) and no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesion. A confirmed PR is PR-PR sequence or PR-CR sequence that were separated by at least 4 weeks. The intermediate missing (Not Evaluable [NE]) scan evaluations between response scan and confirmation scan were allowed, eg, PR-NE-PR and PR-NE-NE-PR was considered PR confirmed (a repeat scan not earlier than 4 weeks after initial scan documenting response). 95% CI was calculated using the Clopper-Pearson method.</description>

        <description>The TTR is defined as the duration from the start of study drug to the first documented response of either CR or PR based on RECIST v1.1, assessed by the investigator. A confirmed CR is defined as two CRs (disappearance of all target and non-target lesions and no new lesions) that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between. A confirmed PR is defined as two PRs (&gt;= 30% decrease in the sum of diameters of target lesions compared to baseline and no unequivocal progression of existing non-target lesions and no new lesion) or an un-confirmed PR and an un-confirmed CR or achieved PR-NE-PR or PR-NE-NE-PR that were separated by at least 4 weeks with no evidence of progression in-between.</description>
