  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent and reversible episodes&#xD;
      of airway obstruction. Drug treatment usually includes inhaled corticosteroids and bronchial&#xD;
      dilators, which often do not have adequate adherence. These acute episodes of&#xD;
      bronchoconstriction can most often occur with hyperinflation and for decades the mechanisms&#xD;
      that lead to hyperinflation have been studied, as well as increasingly modern ways of&#xD;
      evaluating and treating these mechanisms. Noninvasive ventilation is increasingly occupying&#xD;
      its space as a non-pharmacological resource in the treatment of asthma, initially as an&#xD;
      adjunct in an attempt to help medication have its effect reached in the crisis, but this&#xD;
      feature has been showing signs of having an even greater action which can even collaborate in&#xD;
      reversing the crisis by not only giving time for pharmacological action. Recognizing these&#xD;
      potential effects of this widely used resource and understanding its action on lung function&#xD;
      and the reversal of exacerbation is part of this scientific process.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease characterized by recurrent episodes of reversible&#xD;
      airway obstruction. The drug treatment typically includes inhaled steroids and bronco&#xD;
      dilators. These acute episodes of bronchoconstriction can, for the most part, attend with&#xD;
      hyperinflation, the hyperinflation and the consequent increase of functional residual&#xD;
      capacity (FRC) inspiratory muscle activation in phase before the expiratory lung elastic&#xD;
      equilibrium and rib cage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies reports the injury to respiratory function that causes acute hyperinflation with&#xD;
      a reduction of the contribution of the abdominal compartment and increased assistance from&#xD;
      the chest compartment, thereby reducing the efficiency mechanics of the diaphragm in response&#xD;
      to decreased your stamping area. As a result of this disadvantage and mechanics &quot;reduction of&#xD;
      curvature&quot; of the diaphragm expiratory muscle activation occurs in an attempt to restore the&#xD;
      original mechanics and thus your primary function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have investigated the effects of bronchoconstriction in recruitment of the&#xD;
      respiratory muscles and respiratory mechanics of patients susceptible to asthma. As asthma&#xD;
      has distinct characteristics in crisis and in stable phase, testing of bronchial provocation&#xD;
      test have been part of the studies allowing assessment in different physiological conditions,&#xD;
      close to an acute condition without necessarily a crisis and insufficiency that would make it&#xD;
      really an assessment respiratory kinematics and the involvement of the thoracic and abdominal&#xD;
      compartments in each of these phases and mainly in front of any therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bronchial provocation tests are safe once they cause the release of endogenous mediators that&#xD;
      cause the bronchial smooth muscle contraction causing narrowing of the airway, but as your&#xD;
      sensitivity is reduced your action is completely reversed with use of bronchodilator and the&#xD;
      positive response to these tests that can be performed by exercise or inhaling hypertonic&#xD;
      solution 4.5% reflect a inflammation of the Airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interest in the implementation of non-pharmacological therapies and especially the&#xD;
      knowledge of resources used often to relieve the overload of respiratory muscles in patients&#xD;
      with obstructive, since the Decade of 80, has been demonstrating that the use of expiratory&#xD;
      positive pressure can reduce muscle work and reduce the volume of expiratory reserve&#xD;
      contributing to deflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most recently the bronchodilator effect of CPAP mediated by autonomic receptors stretch lung.&#xD;
      What we need to know is the effect of non-invasive ventilation with two levels of pressure&#xD;
      can in addition to trigger this neural reflex, can still promote a kinematics similar to&#xD;
      produced by bronchodilator seen through optoelectronics plethysmography (OEP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Optoelectronics Plethysmography (OEP) has made possible the exploitation of&#xD;
      Thoracoabdominal movement by magazines, reporting especially changes in total volume of the&#xD;
      chest wall during any intervention as the NIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OEP is an innovative method of indirect measurement of pulmonary ventilation, and your&#xD;
      application can be used in different health conditions, like asthma and neuromuscular&#xD;
      diseases, with different protocols. Is a non-invasive method and measurement of non-ionizing&#xD;
      lung volumes, able to detect small movements of the chest wall during breathing through the&#xD;
      analysis of reflective markers attached to the chest wall of the individual; There is no need&#xD;
      to use mouthpiece, nasal clip or other connector of the equipment to the individual; the&#xD;
      calibration is fast and without the participation of the subject.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the NIV with bi-level pressure promotes a level of inspiratory pressure that increases&#xD;
      the expiratory ventilation and a stretch of lung receptors stimulates and bronchodilator&#xD;
      effect, the hypothesis of this study is that the thoracic and abdominal configuration and&#xD;
      improvement of pulmonary function after test of bronchial provocation test is considerable&#xD;
      with the NIV compared to bronchodilator. There are no studies in the literature that discuss&#xD;
      this subject under this optics of assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effects of the NIV in reversal of bronchial&#xD;
      provocation test and your potential bronchodilator effect compared to the gold standard&#xD;
      bronchodilator drug seen by thoracic and abdominal and lung function configuration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. General Purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the responses of the thoracoabdominal configuration and the participation of the&#xD;
      thoracic and abdominal compartments in asthmatic patients before the bronchoprovocation test&#xD;
      and in response to pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1. Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the abdominal thoracic configuration of adolescents and young adults with&#xD;
           stable asthma before and after bronchoprovocation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of bronchodilator and NIV in the thoraco-abdominal configuration&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Materials and Methods&#xD;

      This is a randomized, crossover clinical trial in which it will be performed in two visits&#xD;
      and evaluated the abdominal thoracic configuration before and after bronchoprovocation and&#xD;
      after bronchodilator and non-invasive ventilation (NIV) with two levels of pressure in&#xD;
      adolescents and young adults with asthma.&#xD;
