  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia is associated with difficulty sleeping. The drug zolpidem is widely prescribed for&#xD;
      insomnia. Women have reported worse effects from the drug than men. Women have higher amounts&#xD;
      of zolpidem in their body that may persist after waking. Drug exposure may also depend on&#xD;
      male hormones that change during prostate cancer therapy. Researchers want to see if these&#xD;
      findings can provide a more-accurate dose to healthy women and men with prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To study amounts of zolpidem in men who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer before they&#xD;
      are castrated and after, and to compare these results to healthy women s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men ages 18 and older who have been diagnosed with prostate cancer who are planning to&#xD;
      receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy women age 18 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram (EKG) heart test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male participants will confirm their prostate cancer. This can be done with a tumor sample&#xD;
      tissue from a previous surgery or a report from a doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Female participants may have a pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be admitted to the clinic in the evening and stay overnight. They will:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Take a 5 mg zolpidem tablet on an empty stomach around 11 p.m.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have blood drawn multiple times&#xD;
&#xD;
      Have physical exams and EKGs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Answer questions about their symptoms and medicines they are taking&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male participants will have ADT as part of their standard cancer treatment. After that, the&#xD;
      testosterone in their blood will be measured. They will repeat the overnight clinic stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get a follow-up phone call after each stay.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zolpidem is currently approved for the treatment of patients with insomnia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women reported experiencing an increased incidence of adverse effects than men,&#xD;
           resulting in a reduction of the recommended dose of zolpidem for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Zolpidem metabolism is affected by both age and gender; the recommended dose for the&#xD;
           elderly and female populations is 5mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subsequent studies have shown that women experience greater exposure to zolpidem than&#xD;
           men, potentially due to androgen-driven differences in enzyme expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A preclinical study showed that castrated male rats exhibited zolpidem pharmacokinetics&#xD;
           similar to that of female rats, providing further evidence to suggest that zolpidem&#xD;
           pharmacokinetics are androgen-driven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -To evaluate the effect of castration on the pharmacokinetics of a single 5-mg dose of&#xD;
      zolpidem in patients with prostate cancer undergoing androgen deprivation therapy (prevs.&#xD;
      post-castration therapy) compared to normal healthy females.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with prostate cancer (rising PSA and greater than or equal to 100 ng/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Females in good health condition or without significant diseases&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After androgen deprivation therapy, castrate testosterone levels &lt;50 ng/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparative, single-dose pharmacokinetic study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men with prostate cancer (pre-castration) and normal healthy females will receive&#xD;
           treatment with a single dose of 5 mg tablet of zolpidem followed by 8-hour&#xD;
           pharmacokinetic evaluation of zolpidem and its metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men will then undergo androgen deprivation therapy and when castrate testosterone levels&#xD;
           &lt;50 ng/dL (post-castration), they will receive another 5 mg single dose of zolpidem&#xD;
           followed by 8-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation of zolpidem and its metabolites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal healthy females will receive treatment with a single dose of 5 mg tablet of&#xD;
           zolpidem followed by 8-hour pharmacokinetic evaluation of zolpidem and its metabolites.&#xD;

    <description>In men with prostate cancer, males (precastration, n=8-10) will receive oral zolpidem in the form of a 5 mg tablet. Blood samples will be collected for pharmacokinetic analysis at pre-dose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8-hours post-dose. This cohort of men will then undergo androgen deprivation therapy with standard doses of goserelin. When castrate testosterone levels reach &lt;50 ng/dL (postcastration), they will receive another 5 mg single dose of zolpidem followed by 8-hr PK evaluation of zolpidem and its metabolites. Normal healthy females (n=5-8) will receive treatment with a single dose of 5 mg tablet of zolpidem followed by 8-hr PK evaluation of zolpidem and its metabolites. Blood samples will be collected for PK analysis at predose and 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8-hours post-dose.</description>
