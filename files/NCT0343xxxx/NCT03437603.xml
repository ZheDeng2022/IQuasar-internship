  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To investigate the efficacy and safety for secondary poor graft function (PGF) post&#xD;
      allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). The primary objective is the&#xD;
      hematologic response rate. Secondary objectives include: (1) incidence and severity of&#xD;
      adverse events; (2) overall survival (OS), and disease-free survival(DFS).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Poor graft function (PGF) remains a life-threatening complication that occurs in 5-27% of&#xD;
      patients following allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT), and is&#xD;
      associated with morbidity and mortality related to infections or hemorrhagic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGF is defined below: (1) with two or three cytopenic lines (hemoglobin ≤70 g/L, neutrophil&#xD;
      count ≤0.5×109/L, platelet count ≤20×109/L) with transfusion requirements; (2) with&#xD;
      hypoplastic bone marrow and full donor chimerism; (3) without relapse or severe graft versus&#xD;
      host diseases(GVHD) or active infectious diseases, or drug-related myelosuppression; (4) last&#xD;
      at least for 14 conductive days. Primary PGF refers to those who did not achieve&#xD;
      hematopoietic engraftment at day +28 post-transplant, while secondary PGF(sPGF)was defined as&#xD;
      PGF after full engraftment.The underlying pathogenesis of PGF remains unclear. Therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches for PGF include (1) growth factors, including granulocyte colony-stimulating&#xD;
      factor (G-CSF), erythropoietin (EPO)- stimulating factors and thrombopoietin(TPO) mimetics;&#xD;
      (2) second allo-HSCT; (3) infusion of additional mobilized cells from the original donor&#xD;
      (modified DLI); (4) Cluster of differentiation 34（CD34）positive selected and T cell-depleted&#xD;
      stem cell boost(SCB) without conditioning. and (5) mesenchymal stem cell(MSC) transfusion.&#xD;
      However, second allo-HSCT and infusion of additional unmanipulated stem cells are associated&#xD;
      with high rate of GVHD and treatment-related mortality (TRM). Up to now, there is no standard&#xD;
      treatment recommended for PGF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eltrombopag is a kind of thrombopoietin receptor (TPO-R) agonists which can act as a&#xD;
      stimulator of bone marrow progenitor cells.It has been approved by FDA for the treatment of&#xD;
      immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) and by European Union for severe aplasia anemia (SAA).&#xD;
      Furthermore, there are also increasing amount of clinical trials using Eltrombopag for the&#xD;
      treatment of thrombocytopenia post HSCT and very severe aplasia anemia(VSAA) which already&#xD;
      had promising results. Due to the similarity in symptoms of PGF and AA, we suggested that if&#xD;
      eltrombopag could be beneficial in patients with sPGF post allo-HSCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this single-center open study,20 cases with sPGF post- transplant will be enrolled.The&#xD;
      starting dose will be 25mg daily for 3 days to see if the drug is tolerable and then&#xD;
      increasing to 50mg for another week. Maintenance dosage is 50mg or 75 mg per day dependent on&#xD;
      patients' status and doctors' opinion.Patients may stop medicine when they achieve persistent&#xD;
      complete response for 2 weeks.If patients only get partial response or no response after 8&#xD;
      weeks of therapy they may either stop eltrombopag or continue the drug considering doctor's&#xD;
      advice. Once a patient suffer severe adverse events,patients should discontinue the drug&#xD;
      immediately and get supporting measures.&#xD;
