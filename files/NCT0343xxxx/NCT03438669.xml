    <textblock>
      Patient-reported vision-related quality of life (QOL) outcomes are increasingly incorporated&#xD;
      into clinical trials of new treatments for age-related macular degeneration (AMD). In&#xD;
      patients with central visual field defects they often do not correlate with distance visual&#xD;
      acuity changes as evaluated according to the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study&#xD;
      (ETDRS) protocol. Therefore there is the need for better correlated visual acuity (VA)&#xD;
      outcome measures for these patients. In a current big trial for treatment of dry AMD&#xD;
      (geographic atrophy) reading speed and low luminance visual acuity are used as outcome&#xD;
      measures for the first time. However, limited information is available regarding the&#xD;
      associations between distance ETDRS visual acuity, reading speed, low luminance visual&#xD;
      acuity, contrast sensitivity, morphological parameters and the National Eye Institute Visual&#xD;
      Function Questionnaire-25 (NEI VFQ-25) subscales judged relevant to these measures.&#xD;
      Evaluating these correlations could provide the basis for objective study outcome parameters&#xD;
      which are better correlated to patient-reported outcomes. Further it increases the&#xD;
      understanding of the impact of visual impairment on activities and functioning in patients&#xD;
      with eye diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an immediate benefit to the study patients, as they might gain information regarding&#xD;
      their individual results regarding objective VA measures, contrast sensitivity (and their&#xD;
      impact on reading ability). Furthermore, the results of the study could be beneficial for&#xD;
      future patients due to, e.g., a better understanding of the disease, especially regarding&#xD;
      factors which have an impact on their near vision ability and therefore their quality of&#xD;
      life. The study could provide a basis to find and include outcome measures which are&#xD;
      correlated better with quality of life than ETDRS distance VA for further AMD trials.&#xD;

      3.1 Background and Rationale AGE-RELATED MACULAR Degeneration (AMD) is the leading cause of&#xD;
      blindness among European descended people older than 65 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today, the average life expectancy in developed nations is over 80 years and climbing. And&#xD;
      yet, the quality of life during those additional years is often significantly diminished by&#xD;
      the effects of age-related, degenerative diseases, including age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
      (AMD) Central-field loss (CFL) is often a consequence of macular degeneration, necessitating&#xD;
      the use of peripheral vision for reading That means that AMD affects the central vision,&#xD;
      resulting in central scotomas and therefore the patients have problems with near distance&#xD;
      activities like reading while the peripheral visual field is kept preserved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AMD is a gradually progressive disease that evolves through stages into severe central vision&#xD;
      loss. The earliest signs of AMD involve the appearance of extracellular deposits (drusen),&#xD;
      sub-retinal deposits of oxidized lipids and proteins beneath the retinal pigment epithelium&#xD;
      (RPE), and variable amounts of visible clumps of pigment in the macula. In the intermediate&#xD;
      stages of AMD, drusen become larger and pigmentary changes are more severe. In the advanced&#xD;
      stages, patients develop either sub-retinal choroidal neovascularization (the exudative or&#xD;
      &quot;wet&quot; form of AMD) or the non-neovascular &quot;dry&quot; form of AMD. The dry form of AMD is&#xD;
      characterized by sharply demarcated uni- or multi-focal regions of dysfunctional macula,&#xD;
      termed geographic atrophy (GA). The GA patches gradually enlarge to involve the RPE and the&#xD;
      corresponding neurosensory retina and choriocapillaris layer of the choroid. These&#xD;
      progressive and irreversible changes ultimately cause permanent loss of central (macular)&#xD;
      vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geographic atrophy (GA) may cause significant compromise of visual function, even when there&#xD;
      still is good visual acuity (VA), because of parafoveal scotomas and foveal function&#xD;
      abnormalities antedating visible atrophy AMD is a multifactorial disease with largely unknown&#xD;
      pathophysiology. It is believed to be caused by cumulative damage over a lifetime leading to&#xD;
      progressive deterioration of the RPE, Bruch's membrane and Choriocapillaris-choroid complex&#xD;
      (key players in maintaining retinal function), followed by photoreceptor cells damage.&#xD;
      However, the locus of primary damage still remains unclear. Identified pathogenic mechanisms&#xD;
      to date include a range of genetic and environmental factors related to primary RPE&#xD;
      senescence, oxidative stress, alterations in the complement pathway, increased inflammation,&#xD;
      changes in the balance of growth factors, and excessive lipofuscin accumulation. Areas of GA&#xD;
      are associated with absolute scotomas. Thus, for a period of years, many patients with GA&#xD;
      have good VA because of foveal preservation but are limited by the scotomas surrounding the&#xD;
      fovea. For example, a patient may have VA of 20/40 or better, but be unable to fit more than&#xD;
      a few letters of a word or a full face in the seeing foveal region .Often multiple central&#xD;
      scotomas with very small islands of preserved VA, allow the patient to read single optotypes&#xD;
      but not the whole word Visual acuity is the most widely used measure of macular function in&#xD;
      clinical trials and clinical practice. However, reading ability is an important component of&#xD;
      vision function. Reading difÔ¨Åculty diminishes quality of life . Improvement in reading&#xD;
      performance is one of the main objectives for elderly low-vision patients ETDRS often does&#xD;
      not reflect the reading problems of the patient which are essential in daily life. High&#xD;
      contrast distance acuity is not the only relevant measure of visual function in relation to&#xD;
      the perceived visual performance of a patient with macular disease (Hazel et al. 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The visual impairment experienced by many patients with age-related macular degeneration&#xD;
      (AMD) has been found to affect their ability to perform usual activities, which cause&#xD;
      psychological distress, and limit their participation in social events. PROs of visual&#xD;
      function provide a more comprehensive evaluation of the impact of, and the effects of&#xD;
      treatment for AMD Progression of dry AMD can be slowed in many patients through dietary&#xD;
      supplements while visual loss from wet AMD is treated with intravitreal administration of&#xD;
      anti-vascular growth factor Therefore there is the need to find a better outcome parameter.&#xD;
      The primary purpose of the study will be to evaluate if there is a correlation between&#xD;
      self-reported reading difficulties and new near vision testing instrument results and&#xD;
      secondarily to establish how strong self-reported reading difficulties are-correlated to&#xD;
      functional and morphological parameters. To also evaluate how strong the standard distance&#xD;
      visual acuity measurements (ETDRS) are correlated to further functional and morphological&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study could provide a basis to find and include outcome measures which are correlated&#xD;
      better with quality of life than ETDRS distance VA for further AMD trials.&#xD;
