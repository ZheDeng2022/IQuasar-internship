    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of LNP023 in patients with PNH,&#xD;
      showing signs of active hemolysis despite treatment with SoC (defined as an antibody with&#xD;
      anti C5 activity).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      LNP023 is a novel oral small molecular weight compound, that inhibits alternative complement&#xD;
      pathway (AP). Blockade of the AP with oral LNP023 has the potential to prevent both intra -&#xD;
      and extravascular hemolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study includes a screening period of up to 68 days, a baseline visit, up to&#xD;
      approximately 3 years of treatment with LNP023 administered in addition to SoC, and an End of&#xD;
      Study (EoS) visit 2 weeks after last LNP023 administration.&#xD;
