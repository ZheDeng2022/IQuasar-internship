      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To demonstrate the bioequivalence between Capecitabine Tablets 500 mg of&#xD;
      Qilu Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd, China in comparison with XELODA® (Capecitabine) Tablets 500 mg,&#xD;
      Distributed by Genentech USA, Inc. following a single oral dose administration in adult&#xD;
      cancer patients under fed condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To monitor the safety and tolerability profile of the subjects exposed&#xD;
      to the Investigational Medicinal Product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: a randomized, multicenter, open label, balanced, two treatment, three period,&#xD;
      three sequence, reference replicate crossover, single dose, bioequivalence study under fed&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of subjects: at least 39 evaluable patients Mode of Administration for Test and&#xD;
      Reference product: Patient will be randomized to one of the three treatment sequences i.e.&#xD;
      TRR, RTR or RRT. Where T-Test drug and R-Reference drug. The study medication will be&#xD;
      administered in the morning of Day 1 (Period I of the study), Day 2(Period II of the study)&#xD;
      and Day 3 (Period III of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since, the patients are on a twice daily dosing regimen the patients should receive their&#xD;
      usual dose of capecitabine as per their dosing regimen between each subsequent study periods.&#xD;
      The drug product used to administer the dose between the study periods can be the same or any&#xD;
      approved product as that used by the patients for their current dosing regimen. The morning&#xD;
      and evening doses will be based on BSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood collection times: pre-dose blood sample of 03 mL (00.00) will be collected within 5&#xD;
      minutes before dosing in each period of the study. After dosing in each period (Day 1, Day 2&#xD;
      and Day 3), the post-dose blood samples of 03mL each will be drawn at 0.17 (10min), 0.33&#xD;
      (20min), 0.50 (30 min),0.67 (40min), 0.83 (50min), 1.00, 1.25 (1h15min), 1.50 (1h30min), 1.75&#xD;
      (1h45min), 2, 2.25 (2h15min), 2.5 (2h30min), 2.75 (2h45min), 3.00, 3.50 (3h30min), 4.00,&#xD;
      5.00, 6.00, 7.00, and 8.00 hours following drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioequivalence Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Capecitabine, the bioequivalence will be concluded based on within-subject standard&#xD;
      deviation of reference formulation, termed as SWR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reference - Scale Average Bioequivalence Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When SWR ≥ 0.294 for any of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters, below mentioned both the&#xD;
      criteria must be satisfied: The 95% upper confidence bound for (μT- μR)2/S2WR determined must&#xD;
      be ≤ θ, or equivalently, a 95% upper confidence bound for (μT- μR)2-θ*S2WR must be ≤ 0; and&#xD;
      the point estimate (test/reference geometric mean ratio) must fall within [0.80, 1.25].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional Average Bioequivalence Approach:&#xD;
&#xD;
      When SWR &lt; 0.294 for any of the primary pharmacokinetic parameters, 90% confidence interval&#xD;
      for the geometric least square means ratio (T/R) of that parameter must be fall within the&#xD;
      acceptance range of 80.00% to 125.00%.&#xD;
