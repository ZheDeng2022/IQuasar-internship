      Use PT-112 alone for Phase I dose escalation stage: advanced solid tumors, Phase I dose&#xD;
      confirmation stage: advanced solid tumors. Phase II hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and tolerability of PT-112 injection from 250mg/m2 dose level with 3+3&#xD;
      dose escalation design, find Maximum tolerated dose (MTD), Recommended Phase II Dose(RP2D)&#xD;
      and evaluate the Pharmacokinetic (PK) profile of PT-112 through Phase I dose escalation&#xD;
      stage. Phase I dose confirmation stage: evaluate the safety and tolerability of PT-112 with&#xD;
      RP2D, evaluate the anti-tumor effect of PT-112 at RP2D. Phase II stage: evaluate the&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect of PT-112 at RP2D in advanced HCC&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase I/II clinical trial that includes the dose&#xD;
      escalation stage, dose confirmation stage and phase II stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In dose escalation stage, a 3+3 trial design is adopted for dose escalation. Three dose&#xD;
      groups are designed: 200, 250 and 300 mg/m2, once weekly; 28 days constitute a period. The&#xD;
      drug is intravenously dripped for 60 minutes at the 1st, 8th and 15th day of each period. The&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, PK and preliminary antitumor effect of PT-112 injection alone are&#xD;
      evaluated. After Dose limited toxicity (DLT) evaluation is completed for all the patients in&#xD;
      a dose group, the Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will evaluate the safety and PK of the&#xD;
      dose group based on the resulting data, and decide whether the dose should be escalated, and&#xD;
      whether the dosing regimen or PK sampling points should be adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After dose escalation is completed, the RP2D is selected by SMC for dose confirmation. Dose&#xD;
      confirmation study will include approximately 10 patients each of the following six types of&#xD;
      tumors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Hepatocellular carcinoma Group 2: Gastric cancer Group 3: Colorectal cancer Group 4:&#xD;
      Non-small cell lung cancer Group 5: Head and neck cancer Group 6: Breast cancer If it is&#xD;
      difficult to include the patients with a specific type of tumor, or if the tumor is not&#xD;
      sensitive to the efficacy of investigational drug, the SMC may discuss and decide to&#xD;
      prematurely terminate inclusion of patients in that group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sufficient data are obtained in dose confirmation stage, the SMC may discuss and decide&#xD;
      to initiate phase II trial. Phase II trial plans to include about 40 subjects to evaluate the&#xD;
      anti-tumor effect and safety of the monotherapy in patients with advanced HCC who have&#xD;
      previously received only one systemic anticancer therapy.&#xD;
