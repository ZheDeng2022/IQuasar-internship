  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a, open-label, study to assess the effects of AK002, given as monthly&#xD;
      intravenous infusions at up to 3 mg/kg. A total of 47 patients will be enrolled across 2-4&#xD;
      sites. All patients enrolled in the study will receive 6 monthly infusions of AK002 and will&#xD;
      then be followed for another 8 weeks. Some patients will have the option to receive an&#xD;
      additional 12 months of extended dosing.&#xD;
