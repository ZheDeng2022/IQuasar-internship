    <textblock>
      R34-funded study to pilot test an intervention to improve coping with discrimination and&#xD;
      adherence among Latino men who have sex with men (MSM) living with HIV. The proposed research&#xD;
      aims to modify and refine Siempre Seguiré, a culturally congruent cognitive behavior therapy&#xD;
      group intervention for HIV-positive Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM), to include&#xD;
      strategies for ART adherence and retention in HIV care; and to conduct a small randomized&#xD;
      pilot of Siempre Seguiré to examine feasibility and acceptability, as well as to explore&#xD;
      preliminary effects on coping responses to discrimination and antiretroviral treatment&#xD;
      adherence among LMSM living with HIV.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV-related disparities in diagnosis and disease outcomes persist among Latinos, and Latinos&#xD;
      living with HIV show a lower percentage of viral suppression compared to the general&#xD;
      HIV-positive population. A growing body of work suggests that stigma and discrimination&#xD;
      contribute to health disparities, especially among people living with HIV, who may experience&#xD;
      discrimination due to multiple stigmatized identities related to HIV-serostatus,&#xD;
      race/ethnicity, and sexual orientation. Internalized stigma and discrimination may lead to&#xD;
      health-related disparities by increasing detrimental physiological stress responses,&#xD;
      resulting in maladaptive coping and poor health behaviors, including non-adherence to&#xD;
      treatment. Moreover, the chronic stress of discrimination may weaken immune function, leading&#xD;
      to worse HIV outcomes, including increased HIV viral load. The proposed research will&#xD;
      integrate adherence skills-building strategies into a recently developed intervention,&#xD;
      Siempre Seguiré, an 8-session group cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention for&#xD;
      HIV-positive Latino men who have sex with men (LMSM) that aims to improve adaptive coping&#xD;
      responses to discrimination. The specific aims are: (1) To modify and refine Siempre Seguiré,&#xD;
      a newly developed culturally congruent CBT group intervention for HIV-positive LMSM, to&#xD;
      include strategies for antiretroviral treatment adherence and retention in HIV care; and (2)&#xD;
      To conduct a small randomized pilot of Siempre Seguiré to examine feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability, as well as to explore preliminary effects on: (a) coping responses to&#xD;
      discrimination; and (b) antiretroviral treatment adherence, viral load suppression, and HIV&#xD;
      care retention, among LMSM living with HIV. In Phase 1, HIV treatment adherence intervention&#xD;
      experts and key stakeholders, including a community advisory board, will help to refine our&#xD;
      pilot intervention as needed and update our manual to integrate information and skills&#xD;
      building regarding HIV treatment adherence and retention in care. In Phase 2, a small&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial of 80 participants (40 intervention participants divided evenly&#xD;
      over 4 intervention groups vs. 40 wait-list control participants) will be conducted.&#xD;
      Participants will complete surveys at baseline, and 4- and 6-months post-baseline to assess&#xD;
      coping and HIV care processes and outcomes. Adherence will be electronically monitored, and&#xD;
      viral load will be collected from medical providers at baseline and at 6-month follow-up.&#xD;
      Intervention group sessions will take place once per week for 8 weeks. Sessions will take&#xD;
      place in a private room at Bienestar (a Latino-serving AIDS service organization in LAC) and&#xD;
      will last approximately 90 minutes. We hypothesize that the intervention will improve coping&#xD;
      responses to discrimination and HIV treatment adherence.&#xD;

          <title>Coping with discrimination</title>
          <description>We adapted Brief COPE and R-COPE and asked participants how much they responded in a certain way when faced with discrimination. Responses were 1 = I haven't been doing this at all to 4 = I've been doing this a lot. Functional coping included 16 Brief COPE items, e.g., active coping, and three additional items, e.g., avoid certain situations. Dysfunctional coping included 12 Brief COPE items, e.g., denial. Two R-COPE sub scales were created to assess positive religious coping, e.g., secure relationships with a divine force, and negative religious coping, e.g., underlying spiritual tensions.</description>
