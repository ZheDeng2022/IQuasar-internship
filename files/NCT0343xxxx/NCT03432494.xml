      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAVR is a common therapy for people with heart problems as a better option than surgery. It&#xD;
      stands for transcatheter aortic valve replacement. It is usually done by inserting a catheter&#xD;
      (thin tube) through a groin artery. But this isn t safe for everyone. Researchers developed a&#xD;
      new technique called transcaval access. The catheter is placed in the artery deep in the body&#xD;
      by crossing through the wall of a deep vein. The connection between that vein and the aorta&#xD;
      is closed with a new metallic device they are testing. This is called a transcaval closure&#xD;
      device (TCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety and early feasibility of closure of transcaval aortic access sites using&#xD;
      the TCD after TAVR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults ages 21 and older undergoing TAVR for whom the procedure cannot be performed safely by&#xD;
      the standard artery approach&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed by heart experts including cardiologists and surgeons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have TAVR by the transcaval approach. A small catheter will be passed&#xD;
      between the largest vein in the body and the nearby largest artery (aorta), inside the&#xD;
      abdomen. Through this catheter, the TAVR will be implanted in the usual way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After, doctors will implant the TCD by catheter to close the hole made in the aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be X-rayed. A dye will be injected to view the TCD device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get standard TAVR care afterwards. They will have physical exams, blood&#xD;
      tests, and scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a follow-up scan within 1 month and after 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have follow-up visits and phone calls 6 and 12 months after the procedure.&#xD;

      Transcaval access to the abdominal aorta from the neighboring inferior vena cava (IVC)&#xD;
      enables transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) in patients not eligible for femoral&#xD;
      artery access. Currently the procedure is performed using devices, off-label, designed and&#xD;
      marketed to close holes inside the heart and great vessels, manufactured by Abbott St Jude&#xD;
      (Amplatzer Duct Occluder and Amplatzer Muscular VSD Occluder). Because these Amplatzer&#xD;
      occluders are not designed to close transcaval access sites, they may not completely prevent&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an early feasibility study (EFS) evaluation of a purpose-built closure device for&#xD;
      transcaval access. The device, the Transcaval closure device (TCD) will be evaluated for&#xD;
      safety and performance to close transcaval access sites in patients ineligible for femoral&#xD;
      artery access for TAVR.&#xD;

All of the following must be present:-Alive;-Successful delivery of the TCD, and retrieval of the TCD delivery system;-Deployment and correct positioning of a single intended TCD.
