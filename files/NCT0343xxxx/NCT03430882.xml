    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the sides effects and best dose of sapanisertib, carboplatin, and&#xD;
      paclitaxel in treating patients with malignant solid tumors that have come back (recurrent)&#xD;
      or do not respond to treatment (refractory). Sapanisertib may stop the growth of tumor cells&#xD;
      by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      carboplatin and paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either&#xD;
      by killing cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving&#xD;
      sapanisertib, carboplatin, and paclitaxel may work better in treating patients with malignant&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of the combination of sapanisertib (TAK-228&#xD;
      [MLN0128]) plus paclitaxel, when given with carboplatin, and to determine the optimal dose&#xD;
      triplet, or maximum tolerated dose (MTD), in patients with advanced cancers refractory to&#xD;
      standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the clinical tumor response of this combination. II. To assess toxicity of this&#xD;
      combination. III. To assess progression free survival. IV. To assess molecular signatures&#xD;
      predictive of sensitivity and resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive sapanisertib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 2-4, 9-11, and 16-18,&#xD;
      paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 3 hours on days 1, 8, and 15, and carboplatin IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then receive sapanisertib PO QD on&#xD;
      days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;

    <description>Wilcoxon's Signed-Rank Test and Fisher's exact test will be used for data analysis of continuous variables and categorical variables, respectively.

    <time_frame>Up to 21 days</time_frame>
    <description>MTD is the highest dose level in which 6 patients have been treated with at most 1 experiencing DLT. DLT is defined as treatment-related grade 3 or greater non-hematological toxicity other than nausea, vomiting, or fatigue; drug-related grade 3 or greater clinically significant laboratory abnormalities that do not return to grade 1 or baseline within 72 hours; grade 3 nausea and vomiting related to study drug treatment that is not controlled for 72 hours despite appropriate antiemetic therapy; or grade 4 fatigue related to study drug therapy. Toxicities graded using the NCI CTCAE v. 4.03 toxicity criteria. Descriptive statistics will be provided on the grade and type of toxicity by dose level. This protocol will utilize a standard 3 + 3 design. Three patients will be treated per dose level.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Clinical tumor response based on Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 5 years</time_frame>
    <description>All of the patients who meet the eligibility criteria will be included in the main analysis of the response rate. Patients in response categories 3-8 should be considered as failing to respond to therapy (disease progression). A patient will be determined as having a response if he/she has complete response (CR), partial response (PR). Additionally, a patient with CR, PR, or stable disease (SD) for at least 6 cycles will be considered as having clinical benefit. A patient will be determined as a non-response if there is SD for less than 6 cycles or no evidence of response by 6 cycles during this study. Wilcoxon's Signed-Rank Test and Fisher's exact test will be used for data analysis of continuous variables and categorical variables, respectively. A mixed model accounting for patient effects will be used to analyze longitudinal data over time.
