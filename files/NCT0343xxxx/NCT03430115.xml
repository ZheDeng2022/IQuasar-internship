  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aging is associated with significant declines in muscle mass, strength, and physical&#xD;
      performance, all of which lead to disability, loss of independence, and adverse clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. Obesity exacerbates these age-related declines in function and is associated with&#xD;
      poorer clinical outcomes and quality of life. Weight loss can also worsen age-related loss of&#xD;
      muscle mass and decrease bone mineral density. The overall goals of this study are to&#xD;
      determine if the short-term functional benefits of intentional weight loss are sustained&#xD;
      long-term, and to examine the long-term benefits and risks of weight loss.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity exacerbates age-related declines in function and is associated with poorer clinical&#xD;
      outcomes and quality of life. Although clinical trials conducted study teams show that&#xD;
      diet-induced weight loss interventions in obese older adults, when combined with exercise,&#xD;
      improve body composition and physical and metabolic function in the short-term, the overall&#xD;
      safety and long-term benefits of intentional weight loss in older adults remain&#xD;
      controversial. Weight loss can also worsen age-related loss of muscle mass and decrease bone&#xD;
      mineral density. Because of these concerns, health care providers are reluctant to recommend&#xD;
      weight loss in obese older adults. The goal is to determine whether weight loss-induced&#xD;
      improvements in body composition and physical and metabolic function observed in short-term&#xD;
      clinical trials persist over time is critical to inform geriatric obesity treatment.&#xD;

    <measure>Short Physical Performance Battery score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) is a widely used assessment of lower extremity physical function that consists of 3 standing balance tasks held for 10 seconds each (side-by-side, tandem and semi-tandem), two 4-m walk tests to assess usual gait speed, and 5 repeated chair stands. Each of the three performance measures is assigned a score ranging from 0 (inability to do the test) to 4 (the highest level of performance) and summed to create an SPPB summary score ranging from 0 (worst) to 12 (best).</description>
