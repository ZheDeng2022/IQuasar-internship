    <textblock>
      This study aims to define the association between psychological resilience and biomolecular&#xD;
      signatures in cancer patients and to relate psychological resilience to prognosis, as this&#xD;
      could potentially open up a novel avenue of therapeutic interventions, medical as well as&#xD;
      psychosocial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Individual patients differ in psychological response when receiving a cancer diagnosis. Given&#xD;
      the same disease burden some patients master the situation well and others do experience a&#xD;
      great deal of stress, depression and lowered quality of life. A patient's mental resistance&#xD;
      after acquiring a threat, like a cancer diagnosis, called psychological resilience, is known&#xD;
      to impact the outcome of the disease. Patients with high psychological resilience are likely&#xD;
      to experience less stress reactions, and a better adaptation and management of the life&#xD;
      threat and the demanding therapeutic interventions. How this phenomenon of mastering&#xD;
      difficult situations is reflected also in bio-molecular processes is not much studied and how&#xD;
      these have an impact on the cancer prognosis and the effectiveness of treatment is today not&#xD;
      fully understood. However, there is evidence that expressing the emotions evoked is an&#xD;
      important part of fighting cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that patients displaying a high psychological resilience, according to a&#xD;
      standardized method &quot;The Connor-Davidson resilience scale&quot; i.e. low stress reactions, low&#xD;
      hopelessness and low fatigue, also present a specific pattern of biomolecular signatures in&#xD;
      blood, represented by its epigenome, microRNA and proteomic patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project specifically aims to investigate if breast cancer patient´s psychological&#xD;
      resilience can be coupled to bio-molecular parameters, using advanced &quot;omics&quot; and as a&#xD;
      secondary aim, if it relates to prognosis and quality of life one year after diagnosis.&#xD;

        SCAN-B Resilience is, as a part of the SCAN-B program, a prospective breast cancer study&#xD;
        with established infrastructure for enrollment and follow-ups for patient. The study&#xD;
        population is newly diagnosed breast cancer patients enrolled in SCAN-B at the hospitals in&#xD;
        Karlskrona, Helsingborg, Växjö and Halmstad.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The INCA register (a information network for cancer care) includes almost 100% of all women&#xD;
        diagnosed with breast cancer. Based on comparison with cancer registrations in INCA for&#xD;
        2011-2012, 85 % of all new breast cancer diagnosed women are included in SCAN-B. In April&#xD;
        2017 83% of patients included in SCAN-B were also enrolled in SCAN-B Resilience why a&#xD;
        majority (70%) of women diagnosed with breast cancer are enrolled in this study&#xD;
