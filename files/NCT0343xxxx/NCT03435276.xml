      This is a randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled study conducted on healthy male&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, randomized, single-blind, placebo-controlled, single center,&#xD;
      multiple-ascending dose sequential-group design study conducted on 45 healthy male subjects&#xD;
      to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) of AZD9977, time to reach&#xD;
      steady state, the degree of accumulation and the time dependency of the PK. The study&#xD;
      consists of three visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A screening period (maximum 28 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A treatment period (subjects will be resident from 2 days before first dose of&#xD;
           investigation medicinal product (IMP) (Day -2) until at least 36 after last dose of IMP&#xD;
           and will be discharged on Day 9) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A follow-up visit within 5 to 7 days after last dose of IMP. This study consists of 3&#xD;
           Cohorts (9 subjects each). Based on the safety review committee (SRC) requirement, 2&#xD;
           additional cohorts may be added either to repeat a dose level or additional dose steps,&#xD;
           if required. In each cohort, subjects will be randomized to receive AZD9977 (6 subjects)&#xD;
           and placebo (3 subjects) oral suspension twice daily. The dose of AZD9977 in Cohort 1&#xD;
           will be 50 mg as starting dose and in Cohort 2 and 3 at provisional dose 150 mg and 300&#xD;
           mg, respectively. Each subject will receive a total of 14 oral doses of AZD9977 or&#xD;
           placebo. Each subject will receive a single dose of IMP in the morning of Day 1 and Day&#xD;
           8 and twice daily doses on Day 2 to Day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 and Day 8, subjects will be fasted for 10 hours before dosing until 4 hours after&#xD;
      dosing when lunch will be served. On Day 2 to Day 6, subjects will be fasted for 10 hours&#xD;
      before dosing until 1 hour after dosing when breakfast will be served. On Day 7, subjects&#xD;
      will be fasted for 10 hours before dosing and until after the completion of the oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (OGTT) when breakfast will be served. For the evening dose of IMP (Days 2 to&#xD;
      Day 7), subjects will be fasted for 2 hours before dosing until 1 hour after dosing. On all&#xD;
      days, subjects will be allowed to drink freely until 1 hour before dosing to prevent&#xD;
      dehydration before each morning and evening dose and water consumption could be resumed 1&#xD;
      hour after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing for each ascending dose cohort will proceed with 2 subjects in a sentinel cohort, such&#xD;
      that 1 subject will be randomized to receive placebo and 1 subject will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive AZD9977. The safety data from the sentinel subjects up to 72 hours post first dose&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the principal investigator (PI) before the remaining subjects in the&#xD;
      cohort are dosed. Following review of data from the study, the SRC may decide to adjust the&#xD;
      length of the stay at the study site and the timing and number of assessments and/or blood&#xD;
      samples for subsequent cohorts. The time window between the single dose and start of repeated&#xD;
      dosing may also be adjusted. The duration of the study is approximately 6 weeks&#xD;

    <masking_description>This study is single-blind (in which the study center staff have to remain blinded during the clinical conduct of a given cohort) with regard to treatment (AZD9977 or placebo) at each dose level. In the event of a medical emergency when management of a subject's condition requires knowledge of the trial medication, the treatment received may be revealed by personnel authorized by the PI. Reasons for breaking a code will be clearly explained and justified in ClinBase. The date on which the code was broken together with the identity of the person responsible will also be documented.</masking_description>
