  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study measures circulating, misfolded ATTR oligomers in asymptomatic ATTRm amyloidosis&#xD;
      genetic carriers longitudinally over five years.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in genetic testing have allowed for pathogenic mutation identification in&#xD;
      family members of affected individuals prior to onset of symptoms. While the presence of&#xD;
      mutation and the corresponding TTR kinetic stability have been directly linked to disease&#xD;
      development, the molecular drivers of tissue specific degeneration have not been defined. We&#xD;
      hypothesize that soluble misfolded TTR oligomer species may be circulating within the blood&#xD;
      of these patients possibly years prior to amyloid deposition and could serve as an early&#xD;
      biomarker and/or driver for disease development. In this line, The Scripps Research Institute&#xD;
      has developed a peptide-based probe that specifically labels and integrates into misfolded&#xD;
      TTR oligomers allowing the relative circulating concentration in the bloodstream to be&#xD;
      determined. Longitudinal monitoring of untreated, asymptomatic TTR amyloid genetic carriers&#xD;
      utilizing the Scripps probe is likely to provide novel insight into early disease&#xD;
      progression. We also plan to utilize the Scripps probe to monitor disease progression in TTR&#xD;
      amyloid genetic carriers currently undergoing treatment by observing how treatments affect&#xD;
      the circulating misfolded TTR oligomers. Through enhanced understanding of early disease&#xD;
      progression and treatment efficacy, our hope is to limit amyloid accumulation in cardiac and&#xD;
      nerve tissue and delay the development of the invariably fatal TTR amyloid&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy/neuropathy.&#xD;

    <description>1.) To evaluate the relative amount of misfolded ATTR oligomers in asymptomatic ATTR amyloid genetic carriers and correlate their levels with clinical symptoms and outcomes.&#xD;
Determine if misfolded ATTR oligomers are elevated compared to healthy control data obtained by Scripps during probe development&#xD;
Describe the levels longitudinally&#xD;
Determine if treatment with ATTR-specific medications (examples: diflunisal, doxycycline, ursodiol, tauroursodeoxycholic acid (TUDCA), green tea extract, curcumin, tafamidis, inotersen, patisiran) lead to reduction in the probe levels in those with elevated levels at baseline</description>
