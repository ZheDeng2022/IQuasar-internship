    <textblock>
      According to high tendency for admission of cases of premature rupture of membranes (PROM)&#xD;
      for fear of maternal &amp; fetal complications, we compare here between cases managed at hospital&#xD;
      with other managed at home for if there any difference between in maternal and neonatal&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Premature rupture of membranes (PROM) refers to rupture of fetal membranes prior to onset of&#xD;
      labor at term (&gt; 37 weeks) (American college of obstetrician &amp; gynecologist, 2007; Caughey et&#xD;
      al., 2008).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A premature rupture of membranes (PROM) is observed in 8% of all pregnancies after 37 wk of&#xD;
      gestational age,3% before and 5% after 37 weeks of gestation (Popowski et al., 2011;Keith,&#xD;
      2005) These membranes form an adjustable container for a developing and moving fetus, but it&#xD;
      has limited life time, existing only to the point of programmed rupture at term, which is a&#xD;
      normal event during the first stage of labor (Goldenberg and Rouse, 1998). As fetal membranes&#xD;
      act as a barrier to ascending infection, so once membranes rupture both mother &amp; fetus are at&#xD;
      risk of infection and other complications (American college of obstetrician &amp; gynecologist ,&#xD;
      2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latent period of labor is the time from rupture of membranes to the onset of effective&#xD;
      uterine contractions, as this period tends to increase the risk of maternal and fetal&#xD;
      infection, maternal infection termed chorioamnionitis which occurs in 3-5% of cases of PROM.&#xD;
      While fetal infection occurs in about 15-20% in those with chorioamnionitis. Fetal infection&#xD;
      may occur as septicemia, pneumonia, UTI, local infection as omphalitis (infection of the&#xD;
      umbilical cord or conjunctivitis (Benedetto et al.,2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other complications that may associated with PROM include umbilical cord prolapse in about&#xD;
      1.5% of cases of PROM. Placental abruption, caesarean delivery, postpartum hemorrhage and&#xD;
      postpartum infection (Modena et al.,2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct diagnosis of PROM has great importance because failure to diagnose can lead to&#xD;
      unwanted obstetric complications as chorioamnionitis, preterm birth. On the other hand over&#xD;
      diagnose can lead to unnecessary intervention like hospitalization. The approach to diagnose&#xD;
      rupture of membrane is clinical , with over 90% of cases being confirmed bases on the&#xD;
      presence of suspicious history or ultrasonographic finding followed be documentation of fluid&#xD;
      passing from the cervix (Hasan and Cevder et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causes of PROM is not clearly understood, but the following risk factors that have been&#xD;
      shown to increase the chance of its happening. In many cases, however no risk factors can be&#xD;
      idintified.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Infection: UTI, STD, lower genital infection (ex: bacterial vaginosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intrauterine infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Multiple previous pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Cervical incompetency.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hydramnios: too much AF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Nutritional deficits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Family history of PROM .(Ashley et al., 2003) . 8- Low socioeconomic status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9-Multiple gestation: being pregnant with two or more fetuses at one time. 10- Previous&#xD;
      preterm delivery. (Andrew et al.,2000) 11- Having had episodes of bleeding anytime during&#xD;
      pregnancy. 12- Invasive procedure(ex: amniocentesis). 13- Being underweight. 14- Cigarette&#xD;
      smoking during pregnancy(Jones., 2004) 15- Illicit drug use during pregnancy. 16- Having had&#xD;
      PROM or preterm labor in previous pregnancy.(Parry., 2004) We observe in over 60% of the&#xD;
      cases spontaneous labor begins within 24 hours, in 95% within 72 hours. often labor is&#xD;
      induced after 24 hours because of the risk of maternal &amp; neonatal is rising.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Majority of clinicians advise hospital care to allow monitoring and detection of problems.&#xD;
      But for low risk patients fulfilling strict criteria sometimes home management is possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial management of a woman presenting with suspecting PROM should focus on confirming&#xD;
      the diagnosis, validating the gestational age as maternal and fetal risks vary with the&#xD;
      gestational age at time of membranes rupture as proved by (Morales and Talley. ,1993 ) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to make a distinction between term PROM and preterm PROM (PPROM) which is&#xD;
      rupture of membranes before term (&lt;37 weeks), as the conditions have different etiologies,&#xD;
      risks and recommended management plans (Jones., 2004)&#xD;
