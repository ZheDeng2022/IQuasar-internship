  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the real world effectiveness and safety of&#xD;
      ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone (IRd) in patients with relapsed&#xD;
      and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM), under conditions of standard medical care. In&#xD;
      addition, an exploratory study of biomarkers will be conducted.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The drug being tested in this study is called Ixazomib. Ixazomib is being tested to treat&#xD;
      people who have relapsed and/or refractory multiple myeloma (RRMM) under the conditions of&#xD;
      standard medical care. This study is a non-interventional (observational), domestic,&#xD;
      multicenter, prospective study in patients with RRMM. This study will look at the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of ixazomib in combination with lenalidomide and dexamethasone in&#xD;
      Japanese patients with RRMM as standard medical care. In addition, an exploratory study of&#xD;
      biomarkers will be conducted in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 300 patients. All participants will receive Ixazomib +&#xD;
      Lenalidomide + Dexamethasone (IRd) therapy as standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in Japan. The overall time of observational period&#xD;
      in this study will be 36 months. For each participant, the observation period will be from&#xD;
      the start of IRd therapy until either 24 months after the enrollment date of the final&#xD;
      patient to enroll, or until death or withdrawal of consent, whichever is earlier.&#xD;
