  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to understand how a commonly used drug, nitrous oxide, acts on&#xD;
      the brain to reduce pain. Nitrous oxide is commonly used in anesthesiology but there is&#xD;
      limited knowledge on how this drug affects functional networks in the brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to identify the network transformations that account for the&#xD;
      analgesic effects of nitrous oxide. Our hypothesis is that analgesic doses of nitrous oxide&#xD;
      increase network efficiency and disrupt normal pain processingOur approach is to administer&#xD;
      subanesthetic nitrous oxide during the acquisition of fMRI (functional magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging) and EEG (electroencephalogram).&#xD;

    <measure>Functional Connectivity During Nitrous Oxide</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 50 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Functional connectivity measures will be assessed at rest (baseline) and during sub anesthetic dose nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide). Seed-to-whole brain functional connectivity (Fisher's r-transformed z) will be measured from the left anterior insula, previously shown to be involved in pain and sensory processing. Paired t-test were conducted on subject specific beta maps to identify changes in connectivity associated with nitrous oxide in SPM12. The z-score descriptors represent the Fishers-r-to-z transformed. Here the z-score is a transformation of the Pearson's (r) correlation coefficient of the BOLD timeseries between two brain regions. Higher z-scores are associated with higher correlations in timeseries and correspond with higher functional connectivity between two brain regions.</description>

    <measure>Functional Connectivity Associated With Tonic Stimulus</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 50 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Functional connectivity measures will be assessed at rest (baseline) and during a tonic cuff stimulus (6-minutes). Seed-to-whole brain functional connectivity (Fisher's r-transformed z) will be measured from the left anterior insula, previously shown to be involved in pain and sensory processing. Paired t-test were conducted on subject specific beta maps to identify changes in connectivity associated with nitrous oxide in SPM12. The z-score descriptors represent the Fishers-r-to-z transformed. Here the z-score is a transformation of the Pearson's (r) correlation coefficient of the BOLD timeseries between two brain regions.

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Tonic Stimulus Intensity During Nitrous Oxide</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 50 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Participants will receive a tonic (6 minutes) pressure applied to the lower leg at baseline and under subanesthetic dose of nitrous oxide (35% inhaled concentration). Following each pressure stimulus, participants will rate the pain intensity of the tonic stimulus (0 =&quot;no pain&quot;, 10= &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;, Visual Analog Scale, e.g pain intensity).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Spectral Power of Sub-anesthetic Dose of Nitrous Oxide</measure>

Spectral data during the baseline and sub-anesthetic dose of nitrous to observe changes in spectral power.</description>

        <title>Functional Connectivity During Nitrous Oxide</title>
        <description>Functional connectivity measures will be assessed at rest (baseline) and during sub anesthetic dose nitrous oxide (nitrous oxide). Seed-to-whole brain functional connectivity (Fisher's r-transformed z) will be measured from the left anterior insula, previously shown to be involved in pain and sensory processing. Paired t-test were conducted on subject specific beta maps to identify changes in connectivity associated with nitrous oxide in SPM12. The z-score descriptors represent the Fishers-r-to-z transformed. Here the z-score is a transformation of the Pearson's (r) correlation coefficient of the BOLD timeseries between two brain regions. Higher z-scores are associated with higher correlations in timeseries and correspond with higher functional connectivity between two brain regions.</description>
