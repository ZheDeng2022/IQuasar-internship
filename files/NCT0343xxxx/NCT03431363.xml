      The primary purpose of the study is to observe the adherence and health seeking behavior of&#xD;
      patients with Head and Neck cancer (HNC) certified to obtain medically certified cannabis as&#xD;
      part of their supportive care regimen undergoing treatment with definitive or adjuvant&#xD;
      concurrent chemoradiation (CRT).&#xD;

    <description>Patient dosing options will be stratified into three groups defined as standard, frail/elderly (age &gt; 65 or ECOG 2), and cannabis-experienced (&gt; weekly use of cannabis in the past year outside of NYC Medical Marijuana program). NYC specified cannabis formulation options are defined by THC:CBD ratio as 1:1, low THC:high CBD, high THC:low CBD, and high THC:high CBD.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <biospec_retention>Samples Without DNA</biospec_retention>
  <biospec_descr>
    <textblock>
      Blood (less than 10 mL in an EDTA tube), urine (less than 15 mL), and oral swab samples will&#xD;
      be collected from patients at baseline, once during weeks 1-2, once during week 5-6, and at&#xD;
      the time of post-treatment follow-up appointments. These collections are included in the&#xD;
      Study Calendar (section 4.6). Blood tests are routinely performed on a weekly basis for&#xD;
      patients receiving systemic therapy and we will make all attempts to coordinate biospecimen&#xD;
      collection for study purposes with biospecimen collection for standard clinical care in order&#xD;
      to minimize patient inconvenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each specimen will be analyzed in the Stable Isotope &amp; Metabolomics Core Facility of the&#xD;
      Diabetes Research Center under the direction of Dr. Irwin Kurland. We will test each sample&#xD;
      for over 150 metabolites that are involved in pathways such as the urea cycle, fatty acid&#xD;
      metabolism, and spermidine and spermine metabolism.&#xD;
