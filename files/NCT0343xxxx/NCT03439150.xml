  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In acute myocardial infarction, early restoration of blood flow to the jeopardized myocardium&#xD;
      is of paramount importance to limit infarct size and to improve long term outcome. Primary&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the treatment of choice in these patients.&#xD;
      Despite achievement of adequate epicardial coronary artery reperfusion in many patients,&#xD;
      transient or persistent myocardial microvascular dysfunction is often present, also referred&#xD;
      to as the no-reflow phenomenon. This microvascular dysfunction and the time course during&#xD;
      which it recovers, is most likely also related to long term outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If microvascular reperfusion is still limited immediately after myocardial infarction but&#xD;
      recovers quickly in the days thereafter, this might be beneficial for long term prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several treatments have been suggested to limit microvascular injury and to improve&#xD;
      microvascular reperfusion in the acute phase of myocardial infarction (such as intra-aortic&#xD;
      balloon pumping, glycoprotein IIB/IIIA inhibitors, adenosine, verapamil, nitroglycerine,&#xD;
      cyclosporine, or gap-junction-inhibitors), but it has been difficult to assess the effect of&#xD;
      such treatment due to the simple fact that no methodology has been available for quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of the microcirculation of the heart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of microvascular perfusion and function has been very difficult so far and has&#xD;
      been hampered by a number of methodological and technical shortcomings. Measurement of&#xD;
      absolute blood flow in the infarcted area and true quantitative calculation of absolute&#xD;
      resistance in acute myocardial infarction, has been introduced in the last years using a&#xD;
      technique with thermodilution and continuous infusion of small amounts of saline. This&#xD;
      technique offers the possibility to study the course of microvascular (dys)function after&#xD;
      acute myocardial infarction with potentially important implications for treatment at&#xD;
      follow-up. Technical performance of such measurements was difficult so far because of a&#xD;
      complex instrumentation and the necessity of additional administration of intravenous&#xD;
      adenosine. In the last 2 years, this technique has been largely simplified by the&#xD;
      introduction of a new multipurpose monorail infusion catheter (RayFlow ®, Hexacath, Paris)&#xD;
      and the observation that saline infusion of 15-20 ml/min in itself already ensures maximum&#xD;
      coronary hyperemia. Finally, easy to handle software has been developed for online&#xD;
      interpretation of such measurements. Consequently, measurement of absolute blood flow and&#xD;
      myocardial resistance has become easy to perform now and the complete measurements only take&#xD;
      a few minutes in addition to a regular PPCI or Fractional Flow Reserve (FFR) measurement. The&#xD;
      measurements are absolutely safe, reproducible, only a small amount of saline (100 ml at room&#xD;
      temperature) is needed, no additional medication is necessary, the patient doesn't experience&#xD;
      any discomfort of the measurement and the measurements can be repeated multiple times within&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, a window is opened for further examination and quantitative assessment of the&#xD;
      microcirculation of the heart. The purpose of the present study is to evaluate changes in&#xD;
      myocardial resistance over time in ST-Elevation Myocardial Infarction (STEMI) patients, both&#xD;
      in the early stage and the subacute phase. Furthermore, the course of such changes and&#xD;
      recovery of the microcirculation will be correlated to long-term outcome as assessed by&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) measurements and final infarct size. It is hypothesized that&#xD;
      patients can be divided into 3 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Patients with an (almost) normal resistance and flow immediately after PPCI B. Patients&#xD;
      with still elevated resistance and decreased flow immediately after PPCI, but (partial)&#xD;
      recovery in the next days C. Patients with elevated resistance and decreased flow immediately&#xD;
      after PPCI which do not recover at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators would like to evaluate changes in microvascular resistance of the infarcted&#xD;
      area in the first hour after ST-elevation myocardial infarction and during the recovery&#xD;
      period (&lt;5 days). Classify patients according to recovery of microvascular resistance and&#xD;
      relate the (recovery of) microvascular resistance to outcome and preservation of left&#xD;
      ventricular function (with MRI, echo and clinical follow-up at 1 year).&#xD;
