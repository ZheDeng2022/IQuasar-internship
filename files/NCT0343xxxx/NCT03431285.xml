    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that administration of ketamine for pain relief in sickle cell&#xD;
      patients with vaso-occlusive crisis early on will lead to a more rapid improvement in pain&#xD;
      score and less narcotic requirement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease is an inherited hematological disorder where the shape of red blood cells&#xD;
      (RBC) is altered into a sickle-like cells resulting in red blood cell destruction and&#xD;
      therefore anemia and other complications. It's a widely spread condition in African American&#xD;
      population as well as the Southern and Eastern Provinces of Arabian Peninsula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute painful episodes are a very common complication of the disease process, mainly thought&#xD;
      to be a result of tissue ischemia due to occlusion of the microcirculation with clusters of&#xD;
      sickled RBC(1). This usually involves long bones or spine but can involve other areas. Acute&#xD;
      painful crises can also be precipitated by cold exposure, dehydration, infection, hypoxia,&#xD;
      acidosis, hypercarbia, or in some cases it is not related to a specific trigger. This&#xD;
      condition puts the patient in severe pain requiring multiple Emergency Department (ED) visits&#xD;
      and sometimes admission to the hospital. Currently the mainstay of therapy for acute painful&#xD;
      crises is hydration and IV analgesia (2). This makes pain control challenging for the&#xD;
      emergency physician as management of acute painful crises requires multiple doses of&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) opioids. A retrospective study of 19 patients and 57 visits showed that&#xD;
      accumulative dose of IV morphine ranged between 4 milligram (mg) and 26.7 (0.05-0.5 mg/kg)&#xD;
      during 70% of the visits. 50% of the patients were admitted after less than 3 hours of ED&#xD;
      treatment, 28% of the discharged patients returned to the ED within 3 days (3). Also, as&#xD;
      other chronic pain patients, sickle cell disease patients develop opioid induced hyperalgesia&#xD;
      (OIH) leading to activation of N- methyl D Aspartate receptors (NMDA) (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, may have the potential to&#xD;
      modulate the OIH through impaired sensitization of spinal neurons to nociceptive stimuli and&#xD;
      may, therefore, impede development of and blunt neuropathic pain. Extensive search of&#xD;
      literature databases showed few published reports and retrospective studies including few&#xD;
      patients which have addressed the use of low-dose ketamine in the management of acute painful&#xD;
      crises in sickle cell disease (SCD) (4-6). A retrospective study (5) included 5 children and&#xD;
      adolescents received a low-dose ketamine infusion for the treatment of sickle cell-related&#xD;
      pain demonstrated reduced pain scores in 40% of patients and significant reduction in opioid&#xD;
      utilization in only 20% of patients. However, that report was retrospective in nature,&#xD;
      non-powered, and included few patients. A recent Canadian retrospective study including 9&#xD;
      adult and adolescent patients demonstrated statistically significant reduced cumulative&#xD;
      morphine consumption (146±16.5 mg/day vs. 112.±12.2 mg/day) and pain scores after adding&#xD;
      intravenous ketamine in patients with painful sickle cell crises (7). Similarly, another&#xD;
      American investigators reported decreased opioid consumption with infusing low-dose ketamine&#xD;
      as an adjuvant analgesic in 30 patients presented with sickle cell disease with&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crisis (VOC), that study was retrospective (2). Moreover, in year 2017, a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, double dummy trial was done comparing the adverse effects and&#xD;
      analgesic efficacy of low-dose ketamine for acute pain in the ED either by single intravenous&#xD;
      push or short infusion. This study shows that low-dose ketamine administered as short&#xD;
      infusion is related with a significantly lower rates of feeling of unreality and sedation&#xD;
      with no difference in analgesic efficacy in comparison to intravenous push (8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of investigator's knowledge, there is no large, prospective, comparative,&#xD;
      controlled clinical trial investigated in the addition of low-dose ketamine in shortening the&#xD;
      ER stays and improving the quality of analgesia in patients with VOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size&#xD;
&#xD;
      A data obtained from a pilot study included 10 patients who received either morphine or&#xD;
      ketamine showed that the mean and SD of pain visual analogue score (VAS) at 1-hour following&#xD;
      administering the study drug among patients presented with sickle-cell VOC were (Morphine 6.5&#xD;
      ± 3.41565, Ketamine: 1.6667 ± 1.52753).&#xD;
&#xD;
      An a priori power analysis indicated that a sample size of 220 patients is sufficiently large&#xD;
      to detect a mean difference in the pain VAS of 1.5 that would have a clinical importance,&#xD;
      with a type-I error of 0.05 and a power of 90%. Additional patients (20%) will be added for a&#xD;
      final sample size of 264 patients to compensate for those dropping out during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interim Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent safety committee will perform three interim analyses on information time 25%&#xD;
      (55 patients), 50% (110 patients) and 75% (165 patients). Data evaluation at each interim&#xD;
      analysis will be based on the alpha spending function concept, according to Lan and DeMets,&#xD;
      and will employ O'Brien-Fleming Z-test boundaries, which are very conservative early in the&#xD;
      trial. For the first interim analysis the efficacy stopping rule would require an extremely&#xD;
      low P value (P&lt; 0.000015). For the second interim analysis P&lt; 0.003 will be taken as efficacy&#xD;
      stopping rule. For the third interim analysis P&lt; 0.02 will be taken as efficacy stopping&#xD;
      rule. Investigators will be kept blind to the interim analysis results.&#xD;
