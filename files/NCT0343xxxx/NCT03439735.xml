  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to determine if the investigators can predict which&#xD;
      participants will respond to endocrine therapy and a cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6&#xD;
      (CDK4/6) inhibitor for metastatic breast cancer and which participants will not.&#xD;
      Investigators will use information from the tumor tissue and serial blood samples.&#xD;
      Investigators hope that a deeper understanding of which participants will respond to this&#xD;
      combination and how resistance emerges will allow the investigators to better tailor&#xD;
      therapies for metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have archived tissue or new biopsy collected at study enrollment. This tissue&#xD;
      will undergo special molecular testing. Subjects will also have blood collected at study&#xD;
      enrollment and periodically thereafter. This blood will also undergo special molecular&#xD;
      testing. Information from this testing will not be available to subjects or their treating&#xD;
      physicians as the investigators do not know how this information should impact treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect information about which treatment the subjects receive and how&#xD;
      their cancer responds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any man or woman being seen at Johns Hopkins for treatment of newly diagnosed estrogen&#xD;
      receptor positive (ER+) and/or progesterone receptor positive (PR+) metastatic breast cancer&#xD;
      may be eligible.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Resistance to endocrine therapy (ET) invariably develops in patients with estrogen and/or&#xD;
      progesterone receptor (ER/ PR) positive metastatic breast cancer (MBC). Data regarding&#xD;
      primary resistance and patterns of emergence of acquired resistance in patients treated with&#xD;
      endocrine therapy (ET) and cyclin dependent kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) inhibitors are limited.&#xD;
      Understanding these mechanisms could result in improved selection of treatment options and&#xD;
      provide new targets for therapy development. In this study, we aim to identify and&#xD;
      characterize determinants of intrinsic and acquired resistance to endocrine therapy in&#xD;
      patients with hormone receptor (HR) positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)&#xD;
      negative MBC treated with the combination of endocrine therapy (aromatase inhibitor or&#xD;
      fulvestrant) and a CDK4/6 inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will determine the prevalence of genomic alterations at baseline in the primary&#xD;
      tumor, metastatic tissue and plasma tumor DNA (ptDNA), including in the gene encoding&#xD;
      estrogen receptor- alpha (ESR1). The mutational tumor burden in the primary tumor, metastatic&#xD;
      tumor and blood will be assessed. Blood samples will be collected at several time points,&#xD;
      allowing the detection of changes in molecular markers over time. We will further&#xD;
      characterize tissue markers associated with progression and duration of response by&#xD;
      evaluating these markers in available tissue obtained at progression. Investigators goal is&#xD;
      to evaluate the prevalence and role of known alterations determining endocrine resistance in&#xD;
      patients with metastatic disease, as knowledge regarding this population remains limited.The&#xD;
      investigators also hope to unveil novel markers of endocrine resistance.&#xD;
