  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II study designed to evaluate the kinetics of hematopoietic reconstitution&#xD;
      and the incidence of acute chronic GVHD after partially matched related donor hematopoietic&#xD;
      cell transplantation using an αβTCR/CD19+ cell depleted graft.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Less than 30% of patients undergoing hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT) will have an&#xD;
      HLA-matched sibling donor. There is a high likelihood of being unable to identify a perfect&#xD;
      HLA matched unrelated donor, and the time to procure the marrow if such a donor is available&#xD;
      is generally &gt;3 months. An emerging body of literature suggests that related haploidentical&#xD;
      HCT with innovative graft engineering may provide equal, or possibly superior, outcomes to&#xD;
      conventional unrelated donors. This protocol is designed to test the hypothesis that HCT&#xD;
      using an αβT cell / CD19+ B cell depleted graft from partially matched related donors will&#xD;
      result in rapid, durable hematopoietic engraftment and rapid immune reconstitution with an&#xD;
      acceptably low risk of severe acute and chronic GVHD.&#xD;
