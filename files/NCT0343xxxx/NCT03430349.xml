      This first-in-human (FIH) phase 1 study is designed to evaluate in contained conditions the&#xD;
      safety, immunogenicity, shedding, and genetic stability of two novel oral polio vaccine type&#xD;
      2 (nOPV2) vaccine candidates in IPV-primed adults before testing in a larger adult and&#xD;
      adolescent (&gt; 15 y of age) population, and then in young children and infants.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two nOPV2 vaccine candidates have been developed as attenuated serotype 2 polioviruses&#xD;
      derived from a modified Sabin 2 infectious complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) clone.&#xD;
      nOPV2 Candidate 1 (S2/cre5/S15domV/rec1/hifi3) and nOPV2 Candidate 2 (S2/S15domV/CpG40) were&#xD;
      generated by modifying the Sabin-2 ribonucleic acid (RNA) sequence to improve phenotypic&#xD;
      stability and make the strains less prone to reversion to virulence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the withdrawal of Sabin monovalent oral polio vaccine type 2 (mOPV2) and prohibition&#xD;
      of its use from April 2016 onwards, well before the availability of nOPV2 for clinical&#xD;
      testing, Phase 4 trials have been conducted with Sabin mOPV2 to provide control data on&#xD;
      safety, immunogenicity, against which data for nOPV2 in subsequent Phase I and II studies&#xD;
      will be evaluated and compared. The Phase 4 trials of Sabin mOPV2 were designed to parallel&#xD;
      the expected design of the Phase 1 and 2 nOPV2 studies with respect to overall design,&#xD;
      inclusion of similar study cohorts. As for these reasons head to head comparison of nOPV2 and&#xD;
      mOPV2 is not possible, the overall clinical development plan with the Phase I and II studies&#xD;
      was designed taking into consideration the unique situation of OPV2 cessation in April 2016,&#xD;
      and the global public health need of a vaccine with lower risk of vaccine-associated&#xD;
      paralytic poliomyelitis (VAPP) and vaccine-derived type-2 poliovirus (cVDPV2) (VDPV2) for&#xD;
      outbreak response in the post-cessation era.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This first-in-human phase 1 study is designed to evaluate in contained conditions the safety,&#xD;
      immunogenicity, shedding and genetic stability of both nOPV2 vaccine candidates in IPV-primed&#xD;
      adults before testing in a larger adult and adolescent (&gt; 15 y of age) population, and then&#xD;
      in young children and infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This Phase 1 study will include 30 IPV-only vaccinated adults to be vaccinated with the study&#xD;
      vaccines (15 subjects per candidate vaccine) and followed in contained conditions (28 days)&#xD;
      to obtain safety, immunogenicity, shedding and genetic stability data relevant to the&#xD;
      decision to advance to future studies with testing in un-contained conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were isolated in a purpose-built containment facility named Poliopolis at the&#xD;
      University of Antwerp Hospital (Antwerp, Belgium), to minimize the risk of environmental&#xD;
      release of the novel OPV2 candidates. Volunteers were enrolled sequentially in two groups,&#xD;
      with each group receiving one of the two vaccine candidates, to avoid cross-contamination,&#xD;
      after which they were confined to Poliopolis for 28 days, with further monitoring until end&#xD;
      of shedding. A final safety follow-up call (for those no longer shedding) or visit (for those&#xD;
      still shedding) was made 42 days after vaccine administration.&#xD;

    <masking_description>the study will be conducted with each candidate vaccine sequentially. After randomization of the first participant of Group 1 the next 14 participants will all be enrolled in the same Group and receive the same nOPV2 candidate and the next 15 participants will be enrolled in the other Group and receive the corresponding nOPV2 candidate. Prior to the start of the study the clinical research organization (CRO) will provide the site with 2 randomization envelopes for the first subject. By randomly choosing 1 of the envelopes first subject will be dedicated to a certain nOPV2 candidate and this will determine the allocation of the next 14 subjects to the same Group.&#xD;
Study staff will be blinded in the same way and will be blinded for individual shedding results of the participants of a Group until end of containment of this Group.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Serious Adverse Events and Severe Adverse Events Throughout the Study</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 0 up to 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>Serious adverse events are medical events that resulted in death, were life-threatening, required admission to hospital, or resulted in notable incapacity of the individual. Adverse events were also graded from mild to severe; Severe adverse events are medical events that prevent normal everyday activities or fever &gt; 39°C; this category does not include serious adverse events.&#xD;
Serious adverse events and severe adverse events include both solicited and unsolicited events. Solicited events comprised signs and symptoms that were reported by the participant using a predefined checklist in a diary card, or a fever, as determined by the participant's measurement of their body temperature, for up to 7 days after vaccination. Unsolicited events comprised other signs and symptoms recorded through the end of the study.&#xD;
Adverse events were assessed by the investigator for causality as unrelated, unlikely, possibly, or probably related to the vaccination.</description>

    <time_frame>Days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 14, 21, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>In stool samples that were positive for type-2 poliovirus detected by RT-PCR, infectious virus was measured as 50% cell culture infective dose (CCID₅₀) per gram of stool by use of a modification of the World Health Organization (WHO) cell sensitivity assay.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Shedding Cessation</measure>
    <time_frame>Stool samples were collected from the day of vaccination to Day 28 or until shedding cessation; up to 89 days (novel OPV2 candidate 1) and 48 days (novel OPV candidate 2).</time_frame>
    <description>The time to cessation of shedding was defined as the time interval between administration of vaccine and the date of the first sample negative for type 2 poliovirus shedding (assessed by RT-PCR) after which the following two consecutive samples were also negative.&#xD;
Time to cessation of viral shedding was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods; participants were right-censored if they had not met this endpoint with the last stool sample collected.</description>

    <measure>Shedding Index</measure>
    <time_frame>Days 7, 14, 21, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>A combined index of the prevalence, duration, and quantity of viral shedding in all participants.&#xD;
The viral shedding index was calculated for each participant as the mean of log₁₀(CCID₅₀/g) of samples collected 7, 14, 21, and 28 days after vaccine administration, with the lower limit of quantitation (2.75 log₁₀) as an observed value, and all titers in stool samples with negative shedding results (real-time RT-PCR-negative values) contributing 0 to the mean.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Solicited Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 0 to Day 7</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events were solicited from the participants by the medical team during the 7 days after vaccination. Solicited events comprised signs and symptoms that were reported with a predefined checklist in a diary card, including headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, paresthesia, anesthesia, paralysis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, or fever defined as a temperature of 37.5°C or higher.&#xD;
Adverse events were graded as mild (easily tolerated), moderate (sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities), or severe (preventing normal everyday activities, or temperatures higher than 39.0°C).&#xD;
Adverse events were assessed by the investigator for causality as unrelated, unlikely, possibly, or probably related to the vaccination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Participants With Unsolicited Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From Day 0 up to 42 days</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited events comprised other signs and symptoms that participants reported through the end of the study. Each unsolicited AE was rated on a 3-point scale of increasing intensity:&#xD;
Grade 1: Mild; an AE that was easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.&#xD;
Grade 2: Moderate; an AE that was sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.&#xD;
Grade 3: Severe; an AE that prevented normal everyday activities.&#xD;
Each adverse event was assessed by the investigator for causality as unrelated, unlikely, possibly, or probably related to the vaccination.</description>

    <measure>Neurovirulence Assessed by the Average Percent Paralysis in Inoculated Mice</measure>
    <time_frame>Samples tested were the last post-vaccination sample per participant suitable for analysis; samples used in the analysis ranged from Day 2 to Day 56</time_frame>
    <description>Neurovirulence of shed virus was measured using a modified WHO poliovirus receptor transgenic mouse neurovirulence test (mTgmNVT). The last stool sample provided by each participant that had adequate concentrations of virus for the neurovirulence assay (≥ 4 log₁₀[CCID₅₀/g]) was used in the test. For each stool specimen thirty Tg-PVR21 mice were administered intraspinal inoculations of 4 log₁₀(CCID₅₀) amplified virus. After 14 days the inoculated mice were assessed as either paralyzed or non-paralyzed. For each participant/sample, the percentage of paralyzed mice was calculated. Overall percent paralysis is the average percentage of paralyzed mice over all participants in each group.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Volunteers were recruited via local advertising and confined in a purpose-built containment facility at the University of Antwerp Hospital (Antwerp, Belgium) to minimize the risk of environmental release of the vaccine virus. Volunteers included healthy adults previously vaccinated with inactivated polio vaccine (IPV).</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Participants were enrolled sequentially into one of two groups, and received a single dose of one of two novel oral polio vaccine type 2 (nOPV2) candidates. Participants were monitored for adverse events, immune responses, and fecal shedding of the vaccine virus for 28 days. If if shedding continued beyond 28 days participants were asked to further collect stool samples daily on an ambulatory basis until end of shedding.</pre_assignment_details>

Serious adverse events and severe adverse events include both solicited and unsolicited events. Solicited events comprised signs and symptoms that were reported by the participant using a predefined checklist in a diary card, or a fever, as determined by the participant's measurement of their body temperature, for up to 7 days after vaccination. Unsolicited events comprised other signs and symptoms recorded through the end of the study.&#xD;
Adverse events were assessed by the investigator for causality as unrelated, unlikely, possibly, or probably related to the vaccination.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Solicited Adverse Events</title>
        <description>Adverse events were solicited from the participants by the medical team during the 7 days after vaccination. Solicited events comprised signs and symptoms that were reported with a predefined checklist in a diary card, including headache, fatigue, myalgia, arthralgia, paresthesia, anesthesia, paralysis, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, or fever defined as a temperature of 37.5°C or higher.&#xD;
Adverse events were graded as mild (easily tolerated), moderate (sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities), or severe (preventing normal everyday activities, or temperatures higher than 39.0°C).&#xD;
Adverse events were assessed by the investigator for causality as unrelated, unlikely, possibly, or probably related to the vaccination.</description>

Grade 1: Mild; an AE that was easily tolerated by the subject, causing minimal discomfort and not interfering with everyday activities.&#xD;
Grade 2: Moderate; an AE that was sufficiently discomforting to interfere with normal everyday activities.&#xD;

        <title>Neurovirulence Assessed by the Average Percent Paralysis in Inoculated Mice</title>
        <description>Neurovirulence of shed virus was measured using a modified WHO poliovirus receptor transgenic mouse neurovirulence test (mTgmNVT). The last stool sample provided by each participant that had adequate concentrations of virus for the neurovirulence assay (≥ 4 log₁₀[CCID₅₀/g]) was used in the test. For each stool specimen thirty Tg-PVR21 mice were administered intraspinal inoculations of 4 log₁₀(CCID₅₀) amplified virus. After 14 days the inoculated mice were assessed as either paralyzed or non-paralyzed. For each participant/sample, the percentage of paralyzed mice was calculated. Overall percent paralysis is the average percentage of paralyzed mice over all participants in each group.</description>

        <population>Participants with stool samples evaluable by the neurovirulence test; in the nOPV2-Candidate 2 group only six participants shed sufficient virus at any time point to attempt virus amplification, and amplification did not work for four of these.</population>
