  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our goal is to enhance repeated exposure to acute intermittent hypoxia&#xD;
      (rAIH)/training-induced aftereffects on upper and lower limb function recovery in humans with&#xD;
      chronic spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The experiments in this study will test the following: Hypothesis 1.1(Experiment 1) that rAIH&#xD;
      will enhance corticospinal excitability and upper and lower limb function in humans with&#xD;
      incomplete SCI. Hypothesis 1.2 (Experiment 2) that enhancing the aftereffects of rAIH with&#xD;
      exercise training will further enhance upper and lower limb motor function in humans with&#xD;
      incomplete SCI. Measurements of corticospinal, cortical, and motoneuron excitability will be&#xD;
      tested to further understand the mechanisms of this induced-plasticity. Persons with chronic&#xD;
      (&gt;6 months) spinal cord injury between the levels of C2 and T2. SCI subjects must possess&#xD;
      either the ability to produce a visible precision grip force with one hand, and/or the&#xD;
      ability to perform some small wrist flexion and extension. Additionally, subject must possess&#xD;
      the ability to perform a small visible contraction with dorsiflexion and hip flexor muscles.&#xD;
      Controls must be right handed due to potential differences in the organization of the brain&#xD;
      in right handed and left handed individuals.&#xD;
