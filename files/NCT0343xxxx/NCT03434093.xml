      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research shows that the parietal and prefrontal areas of the brain are involved in short-term&#xD;
      memory. Researchers want to look at the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of&#xD;
      these areas on short-term memory and brain activity. They will use functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (fMRI) to look at brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To look at the effects of TMS on brain pathways involved in memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy, right-handed adults ages 18-50&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 3 or 4 visits at least 1 week apart. They cannot drink alcohol for at&#xD;
      least 48 hours before each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The screening visit lasts about 1 (Omega) hours. It can be combined with the first testing&#xD;
      visit. Screening includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires about being left or right handed and about their ability to imagine&#xD;
           physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first testing visit lasts about 1 (Omega) hours and includes an MRI. For the MRI,&#xD;
      participants lie on a table that slides into a machine. They will lie still or perform simple&#xD;
      memory tasks on a computer screen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second and third testing visits last about 3 hours. Participants will have:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 MRIs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS: A wire coil is held to the scalp. A brief electrical current passes through the&#xD;
           coil to create a magnetic pulse that affects brain activity. They will perform simple&#xD;
           memory tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EMG: Small electrodes are taped to the skin to record muscle activity while they rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the study, participants will complete a questionnaire about any discomfort they&#xD;
      experienced during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Objective: This study aims to identify whether repetitive dual-site transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (TMS) can modulate the functional connectivity between the parietal and&#xD;
      dorso-lateral prefrontal cortices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: The study involves 26 healthy volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: This controlled study comprises 3 main visits for each subject: (1) a baseline,&#xD;
      evaluation visit during which fMRI will be acquired during a visual short memory task along&#xD;
      with diffusion tensor imaging and structural MRI; (2) a visit during which resting state fMRI&#xD;
      (rsfMRI) will be acquired, followed by paired-associative stimulation (PAS) with pulses&#xD;
      delivered over the parietal and then over the dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex, in order to&#xD;
      induce a temporary plastic change in the interaction between the parietal and prefrontal&#xD;
      cortices; the PAS will be followed by another rsfMRI and task fMRI; (3) a visit identical to&#xD;
      #2 during which the PAS will be delivered with pulses in reverse order of previous visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: The effects of PAS will be quantified with rsfMRI and a short working&#xD;
      memory task, considered as a proxy for complex motor and cognitive control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary outcome will be to investigate the resting state functional connectivity&#xD;
           changes induced by each PAS intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary outcome #1 will be to evaluate the difference in visual angle error&#xD;
           between sessions 2 and 3 in a working memory task during which the subjects will be&#xD;
           asked to remember the position of a bar presented on the screen at different time&#xD;
           intervals before the inquiry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The secondary outcome #2 will be to build an fMRI-DTI analysis pipeline for generation&#xD;
           of TMS targets individually customized for each subject and a given task.&#xD;
