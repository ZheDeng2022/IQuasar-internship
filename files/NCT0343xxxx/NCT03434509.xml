  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) has tremendous individual and societal&#xD;
      impact, and the effectiveness of current standard treatments is limited. Thus, there are&#xD;
      potential public health benefits for novel behavioral training programs that could remediate&#xD;
      the core features of ADHD and contribute to sustained improvements in behavioral control.&#xD;
      There is mounting evidence that children with ADHD show difficulties with motor control, and&#xD;
      that these motor deficits are strongly associated with the core behavioral features of ADHD.&#xD;
      Based on this information, the CNIR initiated a feasibility trial of a movement-based&#xD;
      intervention, utilizing Tai Chi practice, targeting improved behavioral control through&#xD;
      engagement of the motor system and results are highly promising. The investigators therefore&#xD;
      will employ an extension of our ongoing Tai Chi programs for children with ADHD, beginning&#xD;
      with children who have already completed one of the previous Tai Chi sessions. This program&#xD;
      will provide the basis for studying the long-term effects of mindful movement, as well as&#xD;
      creating a foundation for exploring the way that such interventions can be expanded into a&#xD;
      more realistic support setting for the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: After participating in the ongoing Tai Chi program, children with ADHD will show&#xD;
      improvements in behavioral measures of motor, cognitive, and attentional control. The&#xD;
      investigators further expect movement-based training will result in decreases in ADHD symptom&#xD;
      severity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persistent poor outcomes for individuals with ADHD make it imperative to explore intervention&#xD;
      approaches beyond medication, particularly interventions that could provide sustained&#xD;
      improvements in control of hyperactive, impulsive and distractible behavior. Two lines of&#xD;
      evidence converge to support a movement-based mindfulness training intervention as a&#xD;
      potential stand-alone or adjunct treatment for the treatment of ADHD symptoms. First, decades&#xD;
      of research, including from the CNIR, has established that many children with ADHD show&#xD;
      impairments in motor control that parallel impairments in behavioral and cognitive control.&#xD;
      Second, there is mounting evidence that movement-based mindfulness interventions are&#xD;
      effective for enhancing behavioral control in adults, although there has been limited&#xD;
      examination in children. Pediatric applications of mindful movement training remain&#xD;
      under-utilized and under-investigated. Critically, there is currently no solid evidence&#xD;
      regarding the long-term effects of mindfulness-based approaches for children with&#xD;
      developmental challenges. By engaging in extended practice, the investigators expect to&#xD;
      effect more readily quantified changes in motor system targets that mediate changes in&#xD;
      cognitive ADHD symptoms. These lines of evidence suggest an outstanding opportunity for&#xD;
      development of long-term novel treatment approaches for ADHD through engagement of the motor&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this application the investigators propose to examine the efficacy of a specific&#xD;
      movement-based mindfulness intervention for children with ADHD - Tai Chi. This approach was&#xD;
      chosen for a number of reasons: 1) extensive documentation in the research literature, 2)&#xD;
      engagement afforded by a martial approach to mindful movement, and 3) scalability given the&#xD;
      existing availability of Tai Chi instruction in the United States and the ease of performing&#xD;
      gentle Tai Chi movements even in the presence of physical limitation. The CNIR has evaluated&#xD;
      the impact of Tai Chi training on specific motor behavioral (e.g., motor overflow, motor&#xD;
      impersistence) and physiologic (TMS assessment of SICI) measures, as well as direct measures&#xD;
      of clinical severity. Interestingly, while robust changes in ADHD symptoms have been&#xD;
      observed, motor system targets have proven more challenging to characterize via laboratory&#xD;
      methods in spite of obvious development of proficiency in tai chi movement skills. The&#xD;
      investigators will therefore engage in a follow-on intervention of greater duration that may&#xD;
      help elucidate changes that were difficult to detect following an initial 8-week tai chi&#xD;
      intervention. By extending the intervention, markers useful in targeting and monitoring&#xD;
      intervention may be better identified, with the overarching long-term goal of optimal use of&#xD;
      Tai Chi and other movement-based approaches to help children with ADHD gain increased control&#xD;
      of impulsive, hyperactive, and distractible behavior. The results of this investigation will&#xD;
      lay the groundwork for future clinical trials evaluating movement training as an effective&#xD;
      intervention for ADHD that could bolster (supplement) or even replace current standard&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tai Chi is a form of exercise with a variety of components and a strong cultural tradition.&#xD;
      In consultation with experienced teachers of Tai Chi, the investigators have received&#xD;
      consistent feedback that &quot;martial applications,&quot; and specifically push hands, will likely be&#xD;
      a valuable component of training for children with high distractibility. Central to the&#xD;
      martial practice of Tai Chi is a collaborative game called &quot;Push Hands,&quot; in which partners&#xD;
      attempt to push one another off balance without the use of strong effort. Push hands, and&#xD;
      other Tai Chi inspired &quot;games&quot; will be used to motivate engagement in slower, more focused&#xD;
      movement training: Tai Chi warm-up, postural and breathing exercises, and a section of a Tai&#xD;
      Chi form. These components are expected to collectively drive learning and development of&#xD;
      behavioral control in the motor domain, with high potential for impact on other features of&#xD;
      ADHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mindful movement instructors have extensive experience with youth instruction, as well as&#xD;
      a keen understanding of the relationships between Tai Chi and other mindful movement&#xD;
      practices (i.e. yoga). An assistant instructor will additionally be engaged to assist with&#xD;
      maintaining class focus. All instructors will be certified for ethical treatment of human&#xD;
      subjects, as well as standards for youth physical education. Sessions will be held in an&#xD;
      athletic facility on the Kennedy Krieger Institute (KKI) Greenspring campus. The athletic&#xD;
      facility was designed and equipped for children with a range of abilities as part of the LEAP&#xD;
      Program (Life-skills and Education for Students with Autism and other Pervasive Behavioral&#xD;
      Challenges). It is advantageously located on a campus that is very convenient for most&#xD;
      Baltimore area families. The facility moreover has a high-impact floating rubber floor. This&#xD;
      environmentally friendly and slip-resistant flooring provides cushioning, which reduces&#xD;
      fatigue and potential for injury to the participants during physical activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and testing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited on a continuous and ongoing basis. During the intervention&#xD;
      training, children will participate in the movement-based Tai Chi training for one hour twice&#xD;
      a week. Up to ten students will participate per class. Students' families will be allowed to&#xD;
      participate in the Tai Chi training &amp; will therefore cap the total amount of people at each&#xD;
      class at 20. It is expected that some students will be unable to successfully complete the&#xD;
      study. Enrollment procedures will be adapted if necessary. As per the &quot;intent to treat&quot;&#xD;
      approach, children will be included in primary analyses irrespective of adherence to protocol&#xD;
      (i.e., attendance). However, children may be requested to leave the class if their absence&#xD;
      becomes disruptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-intervention data collection will occur at the start of participation in the&#xD;
      intervention. Further data collection will continue on a rolling basis with expected data&#xD;
      collection every six months following at a Kennedy Krieger Institute facility. In total, it&#xD;
      is anticipated that 50 participants complete the training and data collection.&#xD;
