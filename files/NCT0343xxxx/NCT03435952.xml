  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some tumors are difficult to treat with chemotherapy or radiation. One of the reasons is that&#xD;
      areas of the tumor do not have many blood vessels, which makes it difficult for drugs to&#xD;
      reach those areas. One way that researchers have recently tried to overcome this problem is&#xD;
      by injecting special kinds of bacteria into the tumors. These bacteria have been genetically&#xD;
      changed to remove the chemicals that are poisonous to humans, but are still able to cause&#xD;
      tumor cells to break down and die. The idea is that these bacteria may be able to assist&#xD;
      chemotherapy drugs in fighting cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of one of&#xD;
      these bacterial therapies (Clostridium novyi-NT spores) that can be given in combination with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab to patients with advanced solid tumors. The safety of this drug will also be&#xD;
      studied, as well as whether it can help to control the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Clostridium novyi-NT is not FDA approved or commercially&#xD;
      available. It is currently being used for research purposes only. Pembrolizumab is FDA&#xD;
      approved for the treatment of melanoma and different types of head and neck and non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancers. It is investigational to use these drugs in combination with each other in&#xD;
      various types of advanced cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study doctor can describe how the study drugs are designed to work.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 18 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

      Study Drug Dose Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of Clostridium novyi-NT based on when you join this study. Up to 4 dose levels will be&#xD;
      tested. Up to 6 participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of&#xD;
      participants will receive the lowest dose level of Clostridium novyi-NT. Each new group will&#xD;
      receive a higher dose than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were seen.&#xD;
      This will continue until the highest tolerable dose of Clostridium novyi-NT is found, or all&#xD;
      4 dose levels are filled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the supporting company (BioMed Valley Discoveries, Inc.) and study doctors&#xD;
      may increase the number of patients in a dose group based on the available study results.&#xD;
      This will not change your participation while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the same dose level of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive pembrolizumab by vein over about 30 minutes on Day 0 and then every 3 weeks&#xD;
      for up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clostridium novyi-NT will be injected into the tumor on Day 8. This is the only injection&#xD;
      into the tumor you will receive. Your doctors may use an x-ray or ultrasound to help place&#xD;
      the needle into the tumor. You will be in the hospital for 7 days to check for side effects,&#xD;
      or possibly longer if your study doctor thinks it is needed. You will be able to go home if&#xD;
      you have no signs or symptoms of infection. If the study doctor thinks it is needed (for&#xD;
      example, based on your tests or any infection symptoms), you may need to return to the&#xD;
      hospital at a later time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting on Day 15, you will take an antibiotic (doxycycline) by mouth 2 times a day for the&#xD;
      rest of your life to lower the risk of further growth of Clostridium novyi-NT. This is&#xD;
      because the study drug is a changed form of bacteria. If you miss a dose or forget to take&#xD;
      doxycycline, take it as soon as you can. If it is almost time for your next dose, wait until&#xD;
      then to take it and you should skip the missed dose. Do not take an extra dose to make up for&#xD;
      a missed dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the doctor thinks it is needed, you will also take additional antibiotics,&#xD;
      piperacillin/tazobactam and metronidazole. The antibiotic that is given and the length of&#xD;
      time you need to take it will depend on your reaction to the study drug. You should still&#xD;
      continue to take doxycycline. Your doctor will discuss this with you. You may receive&#xD;
      piperacillin/tazobactam by vein over about 30 minutes and metronidazole by vein over about&#xD;
      30-60 minutes as often as your doctor tells you to, until your doctor thinks it is acceptable&#xD;
      for you to change to taking the antibiotics by mouth. In some cases, if you need to receive&#xD;
      antibiotics by vein for more than a week or two, your doctor may ask you to have a central&#xD;
      venous catheter placed. A central venous catheter is a sterile flexible tube that will be&#xD;
      placed into a large vein while you are under local anesthesia. Your doctor will explain this&#xD;
      procedure to you in more detail, and you will be required to sign a separate consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may also be given other standard drugs to help decrease the risk of side effects. You may&#xD;
      ask the study staff for information about how the drugs are given and their risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study Participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive 1 dose of Clostridium novyi-NT and receive pembrolizumab every 3 weeks for up&#xD;
      to 12 months. You will then have 12 months of follow-up after you receive the last dose of&#xD;
      pembrolizumab. You will be taken off study early if the disease gets worse, if you have&#xD;
      intolerable side effects, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on the study will be over after the Month 12 post-dosing follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you leave the study early, you or your family will be called every 3 months for up to 12&#xD;
      months to see how you are doing. These calls should last less than 30 minutes each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits and Calls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For your safety, you must stay within 45 minutes driving distance from an emergency room and&#xD;
      also have a caregiver available for at least 28 days after you receive your dose of&#xD;
      Clostridium novyi-NT spores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If an abscess (a swollen area of infection that contains pus) forms in the tumor and it needs&#xD;
      to be drained, the study doctor may decide to collect some of the drainage for research tests&#xD;
      to study the infection and test your immune system response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor biopsy samples (described below) may be collected at different times than listed, or&#xD;
      not at all, depending on the inflammation around the tumor, the amount of tissue available,&#xD;
      or how easily it can be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 0 and 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an EKG to check your heart function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a biopsy sample collected from the target tumor before you receive&#xD;
           pembrolizumab. The tumor sample will be used for biomarker testing, including genetic&#xD;
           biomarkers and to check your body's inflammatory and immune responses to the study drug.&#xD;
           Biomarkers are found in the blood/tissue and may be related to your reaction to the&#xD;
           study drug. The type of biopsy you have will depend on the location of the disease. The&#xD;
           study staff will describe this procedure in more detail, including its risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you can become pregnant, you will have a blood (about 1 teaspoon) or urine pregnancy&#xD;
           test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to find out how long the&#xD;
           Clostridium novyi-NT spores and bacteria stay in your body, and to measure your risk for&#xD;
           bacteremia at 1 hour and 12 hours after the study drug dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 9-15 daily:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have either a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease (Day 15 only).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have any skin lesions, photographs will be taken of these lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you leave the hospital and during the first 28 days after you receive Clostridium&#xD;
      novyi-NT spores, the study staff will call you 1 time each day on the days you do not have&#xD;
      study visits. You will be asked how you are doing. The calls should last less than 30 minutes&#xD;
      each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 18 and 25, you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 21 and 28:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1½ teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 35:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your body's&#xD;
           inflammatory and immune system response to the study drug, to find out how long the&#xD;
           Clostridium novyi-NT spores and bacteria stay in your body, and to measure your risk for&#xD;
           bacteremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 6, 9, 15, 24, 39, 45, and 48, you will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 3 weeks beginning with Week 6, blood (about 1 tablespoon) will be drawn for routine&#xD;
      testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every 6 weeks beginning with Week 6:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have either a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have any skin lesions, photographs will be taken of these lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 9, blood (about 1 teaspoon) will also be drawn for HLA testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 12, you will have a tumor tissue biopsy sample collected of the injected tumor and a&#xD;
      non-injected tumor for biomarker testing and to help learn how your body is responding to the&#xD;
      study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Weeks 9, 24, 33 and 48, blood (about 4 ½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to&#xD;
      check your body's inflammatory and immune system response to the study drug, to find out how&#xD;
      long the Clostridium novyi-NT spores and bacteria stay in your body, and to measure your risk&#xD;
      for bacteremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tests and procedures may be repeated anytime the doctor thinks it is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you stop receiving the study drug(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 3½ tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests, to check your body's&#xD;
           inflammatory and immune system response to the study drug, to find out how long the&#xD;
           Clostridium novyi-NT spores and bacteria stay in your body, and to measure your risk for&#xD;
           bacteremia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have either a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have any skin lesions, photographs will be taken of these lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after your last dose of pembrolizumab:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 tablespoon) and urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have either a CT scan or MRI to check the status of the disease. It will be&#xD;
           repeated every 3 months for up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If you have any skin lesions, photographs will be taken of these lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the last follow-up visit, you or a family member will be called every 3 months for an&#xD;
      additional year and asked about how you are doing. Each call should last about 15 minutes.&#xD;
