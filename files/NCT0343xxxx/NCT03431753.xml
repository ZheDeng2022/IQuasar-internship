  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer (PC) is the most common malignancy (4500 new cases/year) and the second&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-associated mortality (1200 deaths/year) among men in Denmark. PC is&#xD;
      generally diagnosed on the basis of an elevated prostate specific antigen blood test followed&#xD;
      by transrectal ultrasound (TRUS)-guided prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to test early detection of PC in general practice, using the STHLM3 model&#xD;
      with superior specificity and sensitivity for clinically significant PC, combined with&#xD;
      multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) of the prostate and MR guided biopsy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      While early stage PC can be cured by surgery or radiation therapy, advanced PC is incurable&#xD;
      and associated with high morbidity and mortality. Early detection is critical to save lives,&#xD;
      but many newly diagnosed PCs are in reality non-aggressive and will not affect the patient's&#xD;
      life or health, even if left untreated. There is an urgent need to replace current clinical&#xD;
      practice with a more accurate diagnostic approach that can ensure early detection of&#xD;
      aggressive PC while curable, reduce unnecessary prostate biopsies incl. risk of sepsis and&#xD;
      reduce overdiagnosis/-treatment of indolent PC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New molecular biomarkers applied in general practice, serving as a pre-selection test for&#xD;
      follow-up, and accurate and patient-friendly MR-imaging and MR-targeted biopsy at the&#xD;
      hospital may help to solve these problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators will assess the clinical utility of combining genetic risk&#xD;
      testing and plasma protein markers (STHLM3 test) in general practice with mpMRI and MR-guided&#xD;
      in bore biopsy (MRGB) for early PC detection in a biopsy naïve population.&#xD;
