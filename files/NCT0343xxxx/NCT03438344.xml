    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well multi-antigen cytomegalovirus (CMV)-modified&#xD;
      vaccinia Ankara vaccine works in reducing CMV related complications in patients with blood&#xD;
      cancer who are undergoing donor stem cell transplant. Vaccines made from a gene-modified&#xD;
      virus may help the body build an effective immune response to kill cancer cells.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine if multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine (CMV-modified vaccinia&#xD;
      Ankara [MVA] triplex) reduces the frequency of CMV events, defined as reactivation or CMV&#xD;
      disease in CMV+, haploidentical hematopoietic cell transplantation (haploHCT) recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of CMV-MVA triplex in vaccinated, haploHCT&#xD;
      recipients by assessing the following: non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 100 days post&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT), severe (grade 3-4) acute graft versus host disease&#xD;
      (GVHD), and grade 3-4 adverse events (AEs) probably or definitely related to the vaccination&#xD;
      within 2 weeks from each vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize CMV related events in recipients of CMV-MVA triplex compared to placebo,&#xD;
      by assessing time to viremia (number of days from transplantation to the date of &gt;= 1250&#xD;
      IU/mL), duration of viremia, recurrence of viremia, incidence of late CMV viremia/disease (&gt;&#xD;
      100 and =&lt; 360 days post HCT), use of antiviral drugs (triggered by clinically significant&#xD;
      viremia of &gt;= 1250 IU/mL), cumulative number of CMV specific antiviral treatment days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the impact of CMV-MVA triplex on transplant related outcomes by assessing&#xD;
      the incidence of acute graft versus host disease (aGVHD), chronic GVHD, relapse, non-relapse&#xD;
      mortality, all-cause mortality, infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To determine if CMV-MVA triplex increases levels, function and kinetics of CMV-specific T&#xD;
      cell immunity in vaccinated compared to placebo treated, CMV seropositive HCT-recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To determine whether vaccination induces adaptive natural killer (NK) cell population&#xD;
      changes, and increase in the highly cytotoxic memory NKG2C+ NK cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To compare GVHD biomarkers between the vaccine and placebo groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized into 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive multi-antigen CMV-modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine intramuscularly&#xD;
      (IM) on days 28 and 56 post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive placebo IM on days 28 and 56 post-HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 100, 140, 180, 270, and 365&#xD;
      days, and then periodically for 3 years.&#xD;
