      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Motor Symptoms (NMS) are frequent in patients with Idiopathic Parkinson's Disease (IPD).&#xD;
      Clinical expressions, postulated pathophysiological mechanisms and responsiveness to&#xD;
      antiparkinson medication represent differences between IPD and secondary Parkinsonism (SP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate NMS expressions in IPD, SP and a control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis of SP was supported by comorbidity, radiological findings, type of onset, onset&#xD;
      rate and progression, exposures for neuroleptics, and responsiveness to pharmacological&#xD;
      antiparkinson therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were consecutively recruited at two outdoor patient clinics. The Well-Being&#xD;
      Map™ for evaluation. These were completed by the participants at one point before visit. The&#xD;
      controls consisted of non-Parkinsonian individuals, matched by age and gender.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the past decades knowledge of the natural history and progression of Parkinson´s disease&#xD;
      (PD) has increased. Age at onset, time to troublesome complications are well described.&#xD;
      Parallell to this, the society has been more and more aware of differences between gender in&#xD;
      the expressions of diseases. Differences in self reported experiences are of great interest&#xD;
      as this is tightly interconnected with Health Related Quality of Life, (HRQoL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of PD rapidly increase over the age of 60 years (y) , with only 4% of the cases&#xD;
      being under the age of 50 y. The rate for men 19.0 per 100,000, was 91% higher than that for&#xD;
      women (9.9 per 100,000 )The age- and gender-adjusted rate per 100,000 was highest among&#xD;
      Hispanics (16.6,non-Hispanic Whites ,Asians (11.3, and Blacks (10.2). These data suggest that&#xD;
      the incidence of Parkinson's disease varies by race/ethnicity.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Nonmotor Symptoms in Parkinson's Disease:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Of the nine domains in the validated NMSS (Chaudhuri, Martinez- Martin, Brown, et al., 2007),&#xD;
      sexual dysfunction and mood changes have been commonly observed to have associations with&#xD;
      specific gender. While sexual dysfunction has been commonly reported with a significantly&#xD;
      higher proportion among men (Kova ́cs, Makkos, Aschermann, et al., 2016; Martinez-Martin,&#xD;
      Falup Pecurariu, Odin, et al., 2012; Picillo, Amboni, Erro, et al., 2013; Solla, Cannas,&#xD;
      Ibba, et al., 2012; Szewczyk- Krolikowski, Tomlinson, Nithi, et al., 2014), mood symptoms,&#xD;
      which encompass loss of interest in surroundings, lack of motivation, feeling ner- vous, flat&#xD;
      mood, and difficulty in experiencing pleasure, have been frequently reported among women in a&#xD;
      higher proportion compared to men with PD (Guo, Song, Chen, et al., 2013; Martinez-Martin et&#xD;
      al., 2012; Nicoletti, Vasta, Mostile, et al., 2017; Solla et al., 2012; Song, Gu, An, &amp; Chan,&#xD;
      2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is well known that in the general population ( not specific parkinsonism ) in&#xD;
      industrialized societies men die earlier than women but that women have poorer health than&#xD;
      men. Differences discussed are differences in biological risks and acquired risks . But&#xD;
      studies have revealed that the variations in health experiences depend on the particular&#xD;
      symptom or condition in question and also according to the phase of the life cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Already In an article by S.Macintyre et al from 1996 two large British surveys were examined&#xD;
      and revealed a larger complexity than earlier studies had shown in the description of health&#xD;
      surveys and differences between gender. These often described the consistency of reporting&#xD;
      more illness , poorer self-evaluation of health and higher rates of psychosocial malaise in&#xD;
      women than in men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study more complex patterns of sex differences were shown for different symptoms&#xD;
      reported. 'Worrying', 'nerves', 'always tired', 'headaches', 'constipation' and 'fainting or&#xD;
      dizziness' showed the most consistent female excess. Sickness, nausea or stomach trouble were&#xD;
      only dominating among 18 year old females and 'trouble with eyes' among 56-60 year olds in&#xD;
      another large survey. In contrast, two symptoms, 'palpitations' and 'trouble with ears' show&#xD;
      a male excess among middle aged. Female excess was only consistently found across the life&#xD;
      span for the more psychological manifestations of distress, and was far less apparent for a&#xD;
      number of physical symptoms and conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problems relating to reproduction will naturally show a female excess in the childbearing&#xD;
      years, hormonal differences are apparent before and after the menopause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probably an oversimplification have been the fact in older sociological and epidemiological&#xD;
      literature and over-generelization has become the norm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a widely accepted belief that women use health services, particularly mental health&#xD;
      services, more than men. Haavio-Manila has, however, reported that while women had higher&#xD;
      psychiatric admission rates than men in Norway, in Finland and Sweden men had higher rates&#xD;
      (Haavio-Manila E. Inequalities in health and gender. Soc. Sci. Med. 22, 141, 1986.) Why are&#xD;
      more recent data more complex to understand than older studies in the field of gender&#xD;
      differences? One possibility is that female/male differences in health have changed over time&#xD;
      (in the same way that male/female differences in life expectancy may have changed over time&#xD;
      (Macintyre S. Gender differences in longevity and health in Eastern and Western Europe. In&#xD;
      Locating Health: Sociological and Historial Explanations (Edited by Platt S., Thomas H.,&#xD;
      Scott S. and Williams G.), pp. 57-74. Avebury, Aldershot, 1993.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If we are to make progress towards understanding to whether social, psychological or&#xD;
      biological produce or maintain gender differences in health, it is important to pay attention&#xD;
      to the social and historical context of the observations, and to take a more differentiated&#xD;
      agespecific and condition-specific view of 'health' when examining differences between the&#xD;
      sexes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Wingard D. L., Cohn B. A., Kaplan G. A., Cirillo P. M. and Cohen R. D. Sex differentials in&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality risks examined by age and cause in the same cohort. Am. J. Epidemiol.&#xD;
      130, 601, 1989. )&#xD;
&#xD;
      National Quality Registers&#xD;
&#xD;
      A National Quality Registry contains individualised data concerning patient problems, medical&#xD;
      interventions, and outcomes after treatment; within all healthcare production. It is annually&#xD;
      monitored and approved for financial support by an Executive Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swedish Neuro Registries is a quality register with the aim of ensuring that neurological&#xD;
      care is equitable and of high quality and to ensure treatment guidelines are being followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swedish Neuro Registries are represented in all counties and all hospitals where neurological&#xD;
      care is provided. It will be the base for national neurological research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry started as an MS registry in 1996. In 2012, it became Swedish Neuro Registries&#xD;
      with 8 diagnosis: Multiple Sclerosis, Parkinson's Disease, Myasthenia Gravis , Narcolepsy,&#xD;
      Epilepsy, Motor Neuron Disease, Inflammatory Polyneuropathy and Severe Neurovascular&#xD;
      Headache. REFERENS:(&#xD;

      patients are registered within the PD registry, of which about 4600 with a diagnose of PD or&#xD;
      related disorders such as parkinsonism, atypical PD etcetera.&#xD;
