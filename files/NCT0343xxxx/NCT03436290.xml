  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Frequently people diagnosed with cancer experience physical and emotional symptoms during the&#xD;
      course of their disease. These symptoms can be very distressing to both the patient and the&#xD;
      family members. The study doctor wants to know if the introduction of a team of clinicians&#xD;
      that specialize in the lessening of many of these distressing symptoms may improve your&#xD;
      overall care. This team of clinicians is called the palliative care team and they focus on&#xD;
      ways to improve your pain and other symptom management (i.e. shortness of breath, fatigue,&#xD;
      anxiety, etc.) and to assist you and your family in coping with the emotional, social, and&#xD;
      spiritual issues associated with your diagnosis. The team consists of physicians, advanced&#xD;
      practice nurses, case managers, and nurses who have been specially trained in the care of&#xD;
      patients facing serious illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research study is being done because although many people with cancer receive palliative&#xD;
      care late in the course of their illness, the study team thinks palliative care may be more&#xD;
      useful when it is started earlier and in this case before surgery. The main purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to compare two types of care -usual surgery and cancer care and usual surgery and&#xD;
      cancer care with comprehensive palliative care services to see which is better for improving&#xD;
      the experience of patients and families with cancer.&#xD;

      The Surgery for Cancer with Option of Palliative Care Expert (SCOPE) Trial is an&#xD;
      investigation that will study the effect of a palliative care implementation during the&#xD;
      preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative phase for adults undergoing cancer surgery for&#xD;
      selected gastrointestinal and genitourinary malignancies. SCOPE will be a single-blind,&#xD;
      single-institution randomized controlled trial of 236 patients. Intervention arm patients&#xD;
      will receive a preoperative outpatient specialty palliative care consultation from a&#xD;
      palliative care provider (physician or nurse practitioner) in addition to inpatient and&#xD;
      outpatient palliative care follow-up postoperatively. Control arm patients will receive usual&#xD;
      care with palliative care available at the discretion of the primary treatment team&#xD;
      (currently these patients rarely get palliative care and usually only in the last weeks of&#xD;
      life). The central hypothesis of the SCOPE Trial is that preoperative, perioperative, and&#xD;
      postoperative specialty palliative care will improve patient functioning and quality of life&#xD;
      in patients undergoing resection of selected GI and GU malignancies.&#xD;

    <measure>Physical and Functional Quality of Life as measured by the FACT-G TOI</measure>
    <time_frame>90 days after operation</time_frame>
    <description>The FACT-G has 27 questions using a 5-point Likert scale ranging from 0 (Not at all) to 4 (Very much). Questions are phrased so that higher numbers indicate a better health state, leading to some items being reverse-scored. Questions measure the respondents' health state over the last 7 days in four subscales: Physical Well-Being (PWB, 7 questions), Social/Family Well-Being (SWB, 7 questions), Emotional Well-Being (EWB, 6 questions), and Functional Well-being (FWB, 7 questions). The Trial Outcome Index (TOI) is the sum of the Physical Well-Being and Functional Well-Being subscales. The TOI is an efficient summary index of physical/functional outcomes and is a common endpoint used in clinical trials.</description>
