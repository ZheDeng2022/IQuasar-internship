      This was a study of the safety and efficacy of ceftobiprole medocaril compared with&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) standard-of-care cephalosporin treatment with or without vancomycin in&#xD;
      pediatric patients with either hospital-acquired bacterial pneumonia (HAP) or&#xD;
      community-acquired bacterial pneumonia (CAP) requiring hospitalization, and requiring&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) antibiotic therapy.&#xD;

    <description>Ceftobiprole medocaril is the water-soluble prodrug of ceftobiprole, an advanced-generation cephalosporin developed for IV administration. Ceftobiprole is characterized by potent, broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens.</description>

    <description>Ceftriaxone was used as standard-of-care cephalosporin for the treatment of CAP. It is a third-generation cephalosporin with activity against typical bacterial pathogens of CAP requiring hospitalization, and is widely used for the treatment of various bacterial infections in neonates, infants, children, and adults.&#xD;
Ceftazidime was used as standard-of-care cephalosporin for the treatment of HAP. It is also a third-generation cephalosporin, but with broader activity against Gram-negative aerobic bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is active against staphylococci, including methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). At the discretion of the blinded investigator, patients received vancomycin in addition to the IV standard-of-care cephalosporin when MRSA was suspected or confirmed.</description>

    <description>Ceftobiprole medocaril was administered at age-adjusted doses (10, 15 or 20 mg/kg) and infusion durations (2 or 4 hours) every 8 hours. The maximum dose, regardless of body weight, was 500 mg ceftobiprole every 8 hours (maximum total daily dose of 1500 mg ceftobiprole).&#xD;
After a minimum of 3 days of IV treatment, patients with sufficient improvement in disease signs and symptoms could be switched to an age-appropriate oral antibiotic to complete a total minimum of 7 days and a total maximum of 14 days' antibiotic treatment.</description>

    <description>Ceftriaxone was administered at 50 to 80 mg/kg IV as a single daily dose, up to a maximum dose of 2 g/day. The actual dose of ceftriaxone within this dose range was determined by the blinded investigator prior to first study drug administration and was not modified during subsequent study days.&#xD;
After a minimum of 3 days of IV treatment, patients with sufficient improvement in disease signs and symptoms could be switched to an age-appropriate oral antibiotic to complete a total minimum of 7 days and a total maximum of 14 days' antibiotic treatment.&#xD;
At the discretion of the blinded investigator, patients received vancomycin at a dose of 10 to 15 mg/kg IV every 6 hours, up to a maximum dose of 2 g/day, in addition to the IV standard-of-care cephalosporin when MRSA was suspected or confirmed.</description>

          <description>Ceftriaxone was used as standard-of-care cephalosporin for the treatment of CAP. It is a third-generation cephalosporin with activity against typical bacterial pathogens of CAP requiring hospitalization, and is widely used for the treatment of various bacterial infections in neonates, infants, children, and adults.&#xD;
Ceftazidime was used as standard-of-care cephalosporin for the treatment of HAP. It is also a third-generation cephalosporin, but with broader activity against Gram-negative aerobic bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is active against staphylococci, including MRSA. At the discretion of the blinded investigator, patients received vancomycin in addition to the IV standard-of-care cephalosporin when MRSA was suspected or confirmed.</description>

It is a third-generation cephalosporin with activity against typical bacterial pathogens of CAP requiring hospitalization, and is widely used for the treatment of various bacterial infections in neonates, infants, children, and adults.&#xD;
Ceftazidime was used as standard-of-care cephalosporin for the treatment of HAP. It is also a third-generation cephalosporin, but with broader activity against Gram-negative aerobic bacilli, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa.&#xD;
Vancomycin is a glycopeptide antibiotic that is active against staphylococci, including MRSA. At the discretion of the blinded investigator, patients received vancomycin in addition to the IV standard-of-care cephalosporin when MRSA was suspected or confirmed.</description>
