    <textblock>
      Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory&#xD;
      self- limiting disease with non-suppurative inflammation involving one or multiple bone foci.&#xD;
      A bacterial etiology has not yet been proven, but the investigators hypothesize that CRMO is&#xD;
      caused by chronic infection. Using existing knowledge of chronic infections combined with&#xD;
      sensitive molecular techniques, the hope is to elucidate the cause of CRMO by proving or&#xD;
      disproving bacteria as the underlying etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a novel method, 18F-NaF-PET/MRI, will be investigated as to which it can improve&#xD;
      diagnosis of CRMO. The investigators hypothesize that 18F-NaF-PET/MRI will have higher&#xD;
      diagnostic accuracy than 99m-diphosphonate planar bone scintigraphy and SPECT/CT.&#xD;

      Epidemiology, clinical manifestations and prognosis Chronic recurrent multifocal&#xD;
      osteomyelitis (CRMO) is an immune-mediated chronic inflammatory self- limiting disease with&#xD;
      non-suppurative inflammation involving one or multiple bone foci. The disease occurs&#xD;
      primarily in children and adolescents. The estimated prevalence is 1-5/10.000 in the European&#xD;
      population, but since there are no studies providing precise estimates, the number of cases&#xD;
      can be both under- and overestimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean age of CRMO onset is 10 years. There is a female preponderance with twice as many&#xD;
      girls affected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRMO presents with bone pain with or without swelling and warmth. Some patients have a more&#xD;
      acute presentation with severe pain, malaise and fever. All bones except the neurocranium can&#xD;
      be affected. Involvement of the clavicle is classical, but the metaphyses of the long bones,&#xD;
      the mandible and the pelvis are also frequently affected. Vertebral involvement is seen in 4&#xD;
      to 30% of cases in retrospective studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extra-skeletal involvement can include the skin, the eyes and the gastrointestinal tract.&#xD;
      Involvement of the skin may manifest as plantar pustulosis, psoriasis acne, pyoderma&#xD;
      gangrenosum and Sweet Syndrome. In the gastrointestinal tract, Crohn's disease or lesions&#xD;
      mimicking this disease have been associated with CRMO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, the prognosis of CRMO patients was considered favorable, as the disease is often&#xD;
      self-limiting, but newer studies have revealed that physical impairment may persist in up to&#xD;
      50% of patients. They typically suffer from chronic pain, bone deformities and have increased&#xD;
      fracture risk. Furthermore, there is evidence that CRMO may evolve into spondyloarthropathy&#xD;
      with clinical and radiological sacroiliitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathophysiology The pathophysiology of CRMO is largely unknown, but is regarded as an&#xD;
      auto-inflammatory bone disorder. Recent findings indicate that an imbalance between the&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cytokines Interleukine-6 (IL-6) and Tumor Necrosis Factor α (TNF-α), and the&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 may play a central role in the molecular pathology of CRMO.&#xD;
      High levels of IL-6 and TNF-α have been found in serum from CRMO patients. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      has been demonstrated that monocytes in patients with CRMO fail to produce IL-10. IL-10 is an&#xD;
      immunomodulatory cytokine that attenuates inflammation on multiple levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, in bone biopsies from CRMO patients, the lesions resemble infectious osteomyelitis&#xD;
      histologically. Initially the predominating cell types are neutrophils, but in later disease&#xD;
      stages monocytes, macrophages, lymphocytes and plasma cells can be detected. In the final&#xD;
      disease stage of CRMO sclerosis and/or fibrosis can be seen. Infection with propionibacterium&#xD;
      acnes (P. acnes) or other commensal skin bacteria (i.e. Bartonella) have been suggested to&#xD;
      trigger CRMO. P. acnes may induce the toll-like receptors in the monocyte cell membrane,&#xD;
      resulting in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAP kinase) activation leading to production&#xD;
      of pro-inflammatory cytokines. This could suggest that bacteria might be the reason for the&#xD;
      observed imbalance in the pro-inflammatory cytokines, but the presence of bacteria in&#xD;
      biopsies from CRMO lesions has only been demonstrated in single cases. However, in the&#xD;
      majority of reported cases the microbiological investigations were performed solely by the&#xD;
      use of microbiological culture and very few studies have utilized modern molecular&#xD;
      techniques. The methods applied in these studies are more than 10 years old and the&#xD;
      microbiological investigations are far more advanced today.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discrepancy between bacteria found by culture swaps and modern molecular techniques have been&#xD;
      seen in chronic wounds and chronic infection in soft tissue fillers lesions. In these chronic&#xD;
      infections the bacteria are able to form a biofilm. The biofilm itself induces an ongoing&#xD;
      inflammatory reaction, as it provides a protected environment for the bacteria, in which they&#xD;
      may avoid the effects of antibiotics and host immune defence. Bacteria in biofilm grow in&#xD;
      small clusters like planktonic bacterial cells and this complicates identification of these&#xD;
      microorganisms in biopsy material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, a porcine model demonstrated chronic inflammation with formation of biofilm in&#xD;
      bone infected with Staphylococcus aureus. S. aureus is the most frequent cause of&#xD;
      osteomyelitis in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis There are no validated diagnostic criteria and no diagnostic tests for CRMO. First&#xD;
      of all, it is important to exclude differential diagnoses as infection (mycobacterium, septic&#xD;
      osteomyelitis etc.), malignancies (bone tumors, metastases, leukemia or lymphoma), benign&#xD;
      tumors (osteoid osteoma, bone cysts, fibrosis etc.) or other auto-inflammatory disorders.&#xD;
      Biopsy is often needs to exclude an infections etiology or malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone scintigraphy using methylene diphosphonate or hydroxymethylene diphosphonate labeled&#xD;
      with Technetium 99m has high sensitivity in identifying symptomatic as well as asymptomatic&#xD;
      lesions. Monitoring disease activity during treatment or follow-up is also possible with bone&#xD;
      scintigraphy by evaluating the degree of tracer uptake in the lesions. Furthermore, the&#xD;
      technique can be useful in targeting biopsy to the most active lesion or identifying a more&#xD;
      easily accessible lesion than the presenting site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another frequently used modality to diagnose CRMO is whole-body Magnetic Resonance Imaging&#xD;
      (MRI). A study comparing MRI and planar bone scintigraphy found higher sensitivity of MRI in&#xD;
      identifying CRMO lesions. Especially lesions in the spine, pelvis and femora were better&#xD;
      visualized by MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The functional imaging of bone scintigraphy and the morphological information from MRI can be&#xD;
      combined in Positron Emission tomography (PET)/MRI. PET/MRI using 18F-fluorodeoxy-glucose&#xD;
      (18FDG) is increasingly used clinically and in research settings in pediatric patients with&#xD;
      malignant disease. The PET-tracer fluoride 18-labeled sodium fluoride (18F-NaF) is a&#xD;
      positron-emitting bone-seeking tracer that provides higher resolution and better&#xD;
      signal-to-background images, compared to 99mTc-diphosphonate bone tracers. Studies of&#xD;
      18F-NaF-PET in pediatric patients conclude the technique is useful for investigating the&#xD;
      cause of bone pain in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are several potential advantages of 18F-NaF-PET/ MRI. Simultaneous acquisition of PET&#xD;
      and MRI reduces the use of anesthesia and sedation, which is often required for younger&#xD;
      children. The effective radiation dose of 18F-NaF-PET is approximately 3 milliSievert (mSv),&#xD;
      which corresponds to the dose from a 99mTc-diphosphonate bone scintigraphy. Whole body MRI&#xD;
      eliminates the need for low-dose CT scan used in SPECT and therefore reduces total radiation&#xD;
      dose to the child.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The added value of 18F-NaF-PET/MRI in CRMO patients has not yet been investigated. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that the technique has the potential of being a novel gold-standard method for&#xD;
      evaluating bone pathology in children, with the superior morphological images from MRI and&#xD;
      high resolution imaging of bone metabolism from 18F-NaF-PET.&#xD;
