  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clinician directed prophylactic swallowing therapy will improve immediate (four weeks +/- two&#xD;
      weeks) and short-term (26 weeks +/- four weeks) post-treatment swallowing function and&#xD;
      quality of life versus patient directed home exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this prospective, interventional, pilot investigation is to determine whether&#xD;
      clinician directed swallowing therapy will improve patient swallowing function outcomes and&#xD;
      quality of life in the immediate and short-term basis compared to patients receiving standard&#xD;
      of care patient directed independent home swallowing therapy. Patient compliance with home&#xD;
      exercises programs is reportedly inconsistent. Patients may experience changes in their&#xD;
      physical functioning and overall well-being that may impact their ability to follow-through&#xD;
      with independent home therapy. Clinician directed swallowing therapy allows for ongoing&#xD;
      assessment of changes that may warrant modifying the therapy program in terms of intensity of&#xD;
      exercises and/or expectations. This facilitates individualizing the patient's therapy plan to&#xD;
      maximize their function and ability to achieve goals. It is anticipated that individualizing&#xD;
      swallowing therapy through weekly session will result in improved swallowing function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, two-arm, 1:1 randomized, prospective, interventional, pilot study to&#xD;
      determine whether clinician directed swallowing therapy will improve patient swallowing&#xD;
      function outcomes when compared to patient-directed home-based swallowing therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate at least 40 subjects will need to be enrolled/consented in order&#xD;
      to obtain the accrual goal of 15 evaluable subjects for each group for a total of 30&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in each group will receive a face-to-face education session with a speech&#xD;
      pathologist to review a recommended program of swallowing exercises prior to initiation of&#xD;
      chemoradiation at their baseline (pre-treatment evaluation session).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to 6 weeks, Baseline to 30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>DIGEST is a measure of pharyngeal swallowing efficiency and safety. The DIGEST measure incorporates 2 measures:&#xD;
Safety as determined by the Penetration Aspiration Scale with a score ranging from 0 (safe) to 4 (life-threatening unsafe); and&#xD;
Efficiency as determined by the quantity of residue observed on the videoflouroscopic swallowing study with a score ranging from 0 (efficient) to 4 (life-threatening inefficiency).&#xD;
These two measures combine for an overall score, ranging from 0 (no pharyngeal dysphagia) to 4 (life-threatening dysphagia).</description>
