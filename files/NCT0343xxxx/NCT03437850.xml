  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI) often causes an unprecedented change in functioning by&#xD;
      altering bodily structure and function. More specifically, the direct consequences of TSCI to&#xD;
      the motor, sensory and autonomic nervous system not only challenge an individual's&#xD;
      independency but also the ability to make a positive adjustment to life after injury. In line&#xD;
      with this, TSCI survivors often experience threats to their livelihood and becoming&#xD;
      integrated members of society. Health systems therefore need to be ready to respond to the&#xD;
      myriad of challenges following a TSCI by providing access to specialized and comprehensive&#xD;
      services. The provision of specialized care in a time-sensitive manner has shown to be&#xD;
      crucial for survival and recovery of functioning after a traumatic spinal cord injury (TSCI).&#xD;
      However, little is known about the provision of TSCI care in different international&#xD;
      contexts; information which is required for strengthening policy and practice.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Like many unforeseen medical emergencies, a TSCI could lead to early death in the absence of&#xD;
      essential emergency and acute care. Hence, the single most important indicator of the quality&#xD;
      of medical care is reflected in short- and long-term mortality. However, in order to improve&#xD;
      survival after TSCI, it is also important to identify factors and processes of routine&#xD;
      practice related to mortality. This could be accomplished by examining the extent to which&#xD;
      processes of care reflect international guidelines and standards. These guidelines&#xD;
      specifically stress the importance of a systematic approach towards the management of TSCI,&#xD;
      which include specialized and comprehensive care that is delivered in a multi-disciplinary&#xD;
      manner. More specifically, established success factors of TSCI healthcare have proven to&#xD;
      include appropriate emergency management (e.g. transfer logistics to trauma unit), early&#xD;
      spinal surgery and admission to specialist units, as well as multidisciplinary care. As a&#xD;
      collective, literature has shown that a systematic approach towards the management of TSCI&#xD;
      leads to a reduction in mortality, secondary complications and re-hospitalizations, as well&#xD;
      as better functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Sweden, a systematic approach towards the management of TSCI was initiated around the&#xD;
      1970's. A number of studies investigating the acute management and mortality after TSCI found&#xD;
      better aligned processes of care, and significantly greater survival, in Sweden, compared&#xD;
      with a non-systematic approach to care followed in Greece. More specifically, transfer&#xD;
      logistics from the accident scene to a specialized trauma unit, key therapeutic&#xD;
      interventions, and timing of spinal surgery were better aligned to the international&#xD;
      guidelines for the acute management of adults with SCI. In addition, numerous societal&#xD;
      services, such as vocational rehabilitation, modifications of living conditions and workplace&#xD;
      insurance, are provided to survivors of TSCI to enhance their independence and societal&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike Sweden, South Africa had yet to fully implement a systematic healthcare approach to&#xD;
      TSCI management. Access to specialized healthcare services is not only a historic problem in&#xD;
      South Africa, but it is further exacerbated by the lack of resources. Only one specialized&#xD;
      SCI unit is available in South Africa, serving around 8 million people in the Western Cape&#xD;
      Province. With the high incidence of TSCI in South Africa, mainly high risk TSCI patients&#xD;
      (e.g. those in need of stabilizing spinal surgery) get access to specialized care at the SCI&#xD;
      unit. In contrast, those not prioritized for treatment at the specialized SCI unit are&#xD;
      treated at hospitals, including both secondary and tertiary level of care, providing&#xD;
      non-specialized SCI health care. The common occurrence of non-specialized care of TSCI&#xD;
      survivors in South Africa is alarming, especially as such care has shown to be related to a&#xD;
      high mortality rate and the occurrence of preventable secondary complications. To improve the&#xD;
      outcome of TSCI in South Africa, there is a crucial need to audit the nature and timing of&#xD;
      essential processes of care and model their relationship with mortality, complications and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes. Furthermore, given the low one-year mortality in Sweden, a comparison of&#xD;
      processes of care between Sweden and South Africa could provide empirical evidence pointing&#xD;
      to processes which could be modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a first step to strengthening the management guidelines for TSCI care in South Africa, the&#xD;
      overarching aim of this study is to explore health-care processes and outcomes of TSCI care&#xD;
      in South Africa and Sweden. Specific aims are to: 1) describe acute processes of TSCI care in&#xD;
      South Africa and Sweden in comparison to international guidelines, 2) determine acute- and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes of TSCI care, including survival status, secondary complications and&#xD;
      functioning in South Africa and Sweden and 3) identify predictors for survival, secondary&#xD;
      complications and functioning 12 months post-injury in South Africa and Sweden.&#xD;
