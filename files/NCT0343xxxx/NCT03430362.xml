  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Women will be admitted when active phase of labour starts defined as the presence of at least&#xD;
      three regular uterine contractions over 10 minutes with cervical dilatation four centimeters&#xD;
      with cervical effacement not less than 50% and no progress of labor for 2 hours or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amniotomy was done in those with intact membrane and continuous electronic fetal monitoring&#xD;
      was done. Women with prolonged labor after these measures were randomly divided using&#xD;
      automated web-based randomization system into 2 equal groups. Group I included 50 women&#xD;
      received 40mg HBB (Buscopan, Memphis Co, Giza, Egypt) intravenous bolus injection. Group II&#xD;
      included 50 women received 2 ml of normal saline. The obstetrician, participants and outcome&#xD;
      assessor were all blinded to the group assignment. Labor will be monitored by Vaginal&#xD;
      examination every two hours. The duration of the first stage was calculated from the time of&#xD;
      cervical dilatation of three to four centimeters in active labor until a fully dilated cervix&#xD;
      was observed.&#xD;
