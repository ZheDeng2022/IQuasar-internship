    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the blocking of [18F]-JNJ-64413739 uptake in the&#xD;
      brain at the time to reach maximum plasma concentration (Tmax) and at 24 hours postdose of&#xD;
      JNJ-55308942 following a single dose of JNJ-55308942; and to model the exposure/receptor&#xD;
      interaction of JNJ-55308942.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will first undergo a baseline positron emission tomography (PET)/ magnetic resonance (MR) scan with [18F]-JNJ-64413739 on Day 1. In Period 1 (on Day 2) and Period 2 (on Day 1), participants will receive oral dose of JNJ-55308942 (maximum dose 120 milligram [mg]). After approximately 4 hours of JNJ-55308942 dosing, participants will receive an intravenous (IV) injection of [18F]-JNJ-64413739, followed by a PET/MR scan. Doses will be selected based on the principal investigator's discretion. A wash-out period of at least 7 days will be maintained between the 2 doses of JNJ-55308942.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body mass index (BMI) between 18 and 30 kilogram per meter square (kg/m^2) inclusive&#xD;
             (BMI = weight/height^2)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is willing to allow the investigators to place an arterial catheter in the radial&#xD;
             artery, is assessed via physical examination (Allen Test) to be a good candidate for&#xD;
             arterial catheter placement and should not be allergic to local anesthetics for&#xD;
             catheter placement&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  During the study and for a minimum of 1 spermatogenesis cycle (defined as&#xD;
             approximately 90 days) after receiving the last dose of study drug participants must&#xD;
             agree not to donate sperm. If a participant is sexually active with a woman he should&#xD;
             agree to the following: (a) If it concerns a woman of childbearing potential and the&#xD;
             participant has not had a vasectomy, the participant must agree to use a condom and&#xD;
             make sure his female partner is using a highly effective method of birth control&#xD;
             during the study and for a minimum of 90 days after the last dose of study drug. (b)&#xD;
             If it concerns a woman of nonchild bearing potential, who is pregnant or has been&#xD;
             sterilized and the participant has not had a vasectomy, the participant must agree to&#xD;
             use a condom for the given period. (c) If the participant has had a vasectomy, he&#xD;
             should agree to use a condom when being sexually active with a woman of child bearing&#xD;
             potential. Contraceptive use by men or women should be consistent with local&#xD;
             regulations regarding the use of contraceptive methods for participants participating&#xD;
             in clinical studies&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have signed an informed consent document indicating that they&#xD;
             understand the purpose of, and procedures required for the study and are willing to&#xD;
             participate in the study and comply with the study procedures and restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposed to greater than (&gt;) 1 millisievert (mSv) of ionizing radiation participating&#xD;
             as a participant in research studies in the 12 months before the start of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal values for hematology, clinical chemistry or&#xD;
             urinalysis at screening. It is expected that laboratory values will generally be&#xD;
             within the normal range for the laboratory, though minor deviations, which are not&#xD;
             considered to be of clinical significance to the Principal Investigator, are&#xD;
             acceptable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal physical and neurological examination, vital signs or&#xD;
             12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) at screening or admission&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of or current significant medical illness including (but not limited to)&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmias or other cardiac disease, coagulation abnormalities, or other&#xD;
             conditions that the Investigator considers should exclude the participant and preclude&#xD;
             their ability to participate in study procedures. Participants with a history&#xD;
             significant liver or renal disease, or difficulty in urination, which could affect the&#xD;
             metabolism and elimination of the radiotracer or radiometabolites should be excluded.&#xD;
             Participants with a history of epilepsy or fits or unexplained black-outs or loss of&#xD;
             consciousness should also be excluded&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant has a QT corrected according to Fridericia's formula (QTcF) interval of&#xD;
             &gt;450 millisecond (msec) at Screening or prior to &quot;baseline&quot; on Day 1, or has a history&#xD;
             of additional risk factors for torsades de pointes (example, heart failure,&#xD;
             hypokalemia, family history of Long QT Syndrome)&#xD;
