      Introduction: It is known that weight loss results in decreased Resting Energy Expenditure&#xD;
      (REE), due to a decrease in lean body mass (LBM), but also due to metabolic adaptation,&#xD;
      resulting in a higher energy efficiency, responsible for weight regain. Powerlifting athletes&#xD;
      submit themselves to caloric restriction before a competition to reach their desired weight&#xD;
      category. After cessation of the restrictive diet body mass will quickly return to pre-diet&#xD;
      values with a disproportionate gain of fat mass. To avoid fat gain 'reversed dieting' has&#xD;
      become popular among athletes. This involves increasing caloric intake in a stepwise fashion&#xD;
      with the assumption that the small increases in caloric intake might help to restore energy&#xD;
      expenditure toward pre-dieting levels and decrease the chance of increasing fat mass. While&#xD;
      anecdotal reports of successful reverse dieting are available, research is needed to evaluate&#xD;
      its true efficacy. In addition, if the method would work in non-athletes this could be an&#xD;
      important change in the risk of weight regain after a weight loss diet. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To test the effects of the reverse dieting protocol in the prevention of metabolic&#xD;
      adaptation following a period of caloric restriction in weight training athletes. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A convenience sample of 3 powerlifters is used in this study. They are submitted to&#xD;
      a 750kcal/day caloric deficit with a protein intake set at 2x bodyweight (kg) and 30%en from&#xD;
      fat for 6 weeks, adjusted weekly. The reverse dieting protocol adds 100kcal during week 1-4&#xD;
      and 150kcal during week 5-8. REE is measured bi-weekly and body composition at day 1 of&#xD;
      caloric restriction and day 1 and day 56 of reverse dieting. Exercise is kept constant during&#xD;
      the entire period. .&#xD;

      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 66% of the adults in the United States are overweight or obese [Ogden 2006]. Multiple&#xD;
      factors are likely to be involved in the development of this epidemic, including increased&#xD;
      dietary fat and caloric intake, as well as decreased levels of physical activity. Public&#xD;
      health efforts have emphasized the role of preventing weight gain as a means of preventing&#xD;
      the complications of obesity such as a number of adverse medical conditions [Allison 1999],&#xD;
      lower quality of life [Kolotkin 2001] and reduced life expectancy [Allison 1999]. Obesity is&#xD;
      the result of a long term condition of positive energy balance. Energy expenditure is on the&#xD;
      output side of the equation while food intake or caloric intake is on the input side of the&#xD;
      equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) exists of three components, Resting Energy Expenditure&#xD;
      (REE), the minimum amount of energy spent to maintain bodily functions, which on average is&#xD;
      responsible for 60-70% of TDEE, the Thermic Effect of Food (TEF), the energy necessary for&#xD;
      the absorption and digestion of the food we eat, which takes up about 10%, and Physical&#xD;
      Activity related energy expenditure, which varies largely from day to day depending on the&#xD;
      amount of activity performed [de Jonge 1997]. This includes Non-Exercise Activity&#xD;
      Thermogenesis (NEAT), the energy expenditure from fidgeting or moving (Levine, 2004). A low&#xD;
      REE has been shown to be a predictor of weight gain over time [Ravussin 1993]. It is well&#xD;
      known that weight loss results in a decrease of REE, due in part to a decrease in lean body&#xD;
      mass, the strongest predictor of REE [Tataranni 1995], but also due to a metabolic adaptation&#xD;
      to the caloric restriction, resulting in a higher energy efficiency which serves to prevent&#xD;
      further weight loss and conserve energy. However, this energy conservation is also&#xD;
      responsible for the weight regain after weight loss [Martin 2007]. Many obesity treatments&#xD;
      are therefore focused on limiting the decrease in REE as much as possible whether is by diet,&#xD;
      exercise, medication or a combination of the three in order to slow down the process of&#xD;
      weight regain. The applicant's research program has focused on the prevention of weight&#xD;
      regain and metabolic adaptation to changes in diet and energy balance over the past 20 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physique and powerlifting athletes often submit themselves to periods of caloric restriction&#xD;
      in the weeks before a competition or a meet in order to reach their desired leanness or&#xD;
      weight category. In the period shortly after cessation of the restrictive diet body mass will&#xD;
      quickly return to pre-diet values with a disproportionate gain of fat mass. To avoid this&#xD;
      rapid fat gain 'reverse dieting' has become popular among athletes. This involves slowly&#xD;
      increasing caloric intake in a slow, stepwise fashion. The theory behind this is that the&#xD;
      small increase in caloric intake might help to restore energy expenditure toward pre-dieting&#xD;
      levels and decrease the chance of increasing fat mass. While anecdotal reports of successful&#xD;
      reverse dieting have led to an increase in popularity, research is needed to evaluate its&#xD;
      true efficacy. In addition, only reports in trained athletes are available at this moment&#xD;
      while, if the method would work in non-athlete individuals, this could be an important change&#xD;
      in the risk of weight regain after a weight loss diet. However, since this method has been&#xD;
      used in the weight training population, the proposed study will use this population to test&#xD;
      the feasibility and fine tune the measurement schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the proposed project is therefore twofold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the feasibility of the reverse dieting protocol in the prevention of weight gain&#xD;
           and body fat gain following a period of caloric restriction in weight training athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To fine tune a measurement schedule for the reverse dieting protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study population: A convenience sample of 3 male weight training athletes aged&#xD;
      20-25yrs from the GMU campus who have verbally showed interest in taking part in the study&#xD;
      will be used as our population in this feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Upon enrollment and signing of the consent form, maintenance energy intake will&#xD;
      be estimated using REE values as measured by metabolic cart multiplied by an estimated&#xD;
      activity factor as assessed by the Baeke physical activity questionnaire. The estimated&#xD;
      energy intake will be verified and adjusted during one week of daily weigh-ins. Once&#xD;
      maintenance energy intake has been established, baseline REE, body composition and body&#xD;
      strength will be assessed and a 6 week period of diet restriction will start using the&#xD;
      protocol described below. Body weight will be measured weekly, but tracked daily by&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 6 weeks of caloric restriction of REE leading to an estimated 4kg weight loss, body&#xD;
      composition and strength will be assessed again and a period of 8 weeks of refeeding will&#xD;
      start using the protocol below. During this period, REE will be assessed every two weeks and&#xD;
      body weight will be assessed weekly. Body composition will be assessed at 4 weeks and 8 weeks&#xD;
      and strength will be reassessed after 8 weeks of refeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet Prescription:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Period of restriction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prescription for period of restriction will be determined by the evidence-based&#xD;
      recommendations for natural bodybuilding contest preparation by Eric Helms and Alan Aragon&#xD;
      (Helms, Aragon, &amp; Fitschen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Starting caloric intake will be calculated as maintenance energy intake, assessed by&#xD;
      multiplying REE by an activity factor, minus 750 kcal, resulting in an approximate weight&#xD;
      loss of .68 kg / week. Calories will be manipulated by adding or subtracting only fats and&#xD;
      CHO, protein intake will remain the same throughout the entire intervention. Fats and carbs&#xD;
      will be manipulated with a 1:5 ratio; meaning for every drop of 1g of fat there will be a&#xD;
      drop of 5g in CHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protein Intake: Determined by the following equation and will remain the same throughout&#xD;
           the entire intervention: (Body weight in kg * 2) + 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Starting Fat Intake: 30% of calories will be from fats. Will be determined by the&#xD;
           following equation: (kcal * 0.3) / 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CHO Intake: CHO will make up the remaining calories. Will be determined by the following&#xD;
           equation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      [kcal - (Starting Fat Intake * 9) - (Protein Intake * 4)] / 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reverse diet Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ending calories from the period of restriction is the starting point of the reverse diet&#xD;
      which will be executed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 1 to 4: Increase 100 kcal (+ 16g CHO, + 4g Fat) / week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Weeks 5 to 8: Increase 150 kcal (+ 25g CHO, + 5g Fat) / week&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry: Body weight will be assessed at baseline and on a weekly basis thereafter&#xD;
      using a Healthometer 752KL scale (Perspective Enterprise, Portage MI). Body weight will be&#xD;
      tracked by participants on an individual level with an in home scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body Composition: Whole body soft tissue composition (body fat and lean mass) will be&#xD;
      measured using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA; Hologic). DXA is regarded as the&#xD;
      criterion method of body composition. Both total body fat (expressed as kg and %) and trunk&#xD;
      fat (kg) values are available from the DXA software. This measure is rapid, taking a total of&#xD;
      3 minutes x-ray time and the low radiation (&lt;10 µSV) will not exceed limits for x-ray&#xD;
      exposure. In comparison, individuals are exposed to ~6 µSV of naturally occurring background&#xD;
      radiation daily in the US (epa.gov).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Energy expenditure and substrate oxidation : Resting energy expenditure will be assess by&#xD;
      indirect calorimetry using a ventilated hood system (Quark RMR, Cosmed Inc., Rome, Italy).&#xD;
      The Quark RMR measures oxygen consumption and CO2 production via a breath by breath technique&#xD;
      using a paramagnetic oxygen analyzer and an infrared CO2 analyzer. Energy expenditure and&#xD;
      substrate oxidations will be calculated from oxygen consumption, CO2 production and urinary&#xD;
      nitrogen by using the equations of Acheson et al [Acheson 1984].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intake: Dietary Intake will be assessed weekly using the web-based Automated&#xD;
      Self-Administered 24H dietary recall (ASA-24) (Subar 2012). Nutrient and food group data&#xD;
      collected from the 24-hour recalls will be used to assess participants' changes in dietary&#xD;
      patterns. Participants will be sent weekly e-mail reminders to complete the 24 hour recalls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will track diet with Myfitnesspal every day. This will be&#xD;
      monitored by the team of researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Macronutrient and caloric intakes will be assessed weekly using data from myfitnesspal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity: Physical activity will be assessed using the Baeke physical activity&#xD;
      questionnaire [Baeke 1982].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strength Assessments: Strength will be assessed at 3 time points; the beginning of diet&#xD;
      restriction, the end of diet restriction and at the end of the study using the following&#xD;
      scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 attempts on squat 1 rep max&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 attempts on bench 1 rep max&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 attempts on deadlift 1 rep max The three lifts will then be added together to&#xD;
           determine the participants total. This order and amount of attempts directly mimics that&#xD;
           of a powerlifting meet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics: The study will be approved by GMU Human Subjects Institutional Review Board and&#xD;
      informed consent will be obtained before enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance &amp; Future Directions This work will help establish the feasibility of conducting&#xD;
      a refeeding protocol and fine tune the measurement schedule. It will be the first study to&#xD;
      describe the physiology behind the refeeding approach to prevent weight gain and will support&#xD;
      future research efforts and aid in the establishment of the applicant's research program at&#xD;
      GMU. The results will be used to develop a randomized clinical trial to test the&#xD;
      applicability of the reversed dieting approach to prevent weight gain after weight loss, as&#xD;
      opposed to the conventional methods, in a non-strength training population. The results will&#xD;
      be used to seek external research funds to develop this clinical trial which could lead to a&#xD;
      change in the approach to weight loss and the risk of weight regain.&#xD;
