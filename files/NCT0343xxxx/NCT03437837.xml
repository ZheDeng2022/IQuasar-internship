  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prognostic assessment after preoperative systemic therapy (PST) plays a vital role in breast&#xD;
      cancer patients. The clinical-pathologic staging system incorporating estrogen receptor&#xD;
      (ER)-negative disease and nuclear grade 3 tumor pathology (CPS+EG staging system) can&#xD;
      effectively predict prognosis after PST. The Neo-Bioscore has been developed by the&#xD;
      incorporation of the human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status into the CPS+EG&#xD;
      staging system. But in a real world in China, the both staging systems had limits because of&#xD;
      trastuzumab administration varied a lot in China from the United States. This retrospective&#xD;
      study will validate CPS+EG and Neo-Bioscore system and explored a modified Neo-Bioscore&#xD;
      system in multiple centers.&#xD;

    <measure>Disease-free survival (DFS)</measure>

    <description>DFS, defined as the time from the time of post-PST breast cancer surgery to local recurrence following mastectomy, local recurrence in the ipsilateral breast following lumpectomy (invasive or non-invasive), regional recurrence, distant metastasis, contralateral breast cancer (invasive or non-invasive), second primary cancer (other than squamous or basal cell carcinoma of the skin, melanoma in situ, carcinoma in situ of the cervix, colorectal carcinoma in situ, or lobular carcinoma in situ of the breast), or death from any cause prior to recurrence or second primary cancer. Patients who have not had any such event at the time of data analysis will be censored at the last date they were known to be event-free.</description>
