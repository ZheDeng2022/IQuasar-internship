  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate approximately 3 months of treatment with the drug olaparib in&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer. A capsule formulation of olaparib (tradename Lynparza™) is&#xD;
      approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of women&#xD;
      with advanced BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer. Olaparib is an investigational drug in prostate&#xD;
      cancer. A tablet formulation of olaparib is being tested in this study. It is a new&#xD;
      formulation which is more convenient for patients than the approved capsule formulation&#xD;
      because fewer tablets of olaparib need to be taken daily than with capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate whether olaparib can reduce prostate cancer with&#xD;
      defects in DNA repair genes when olaparib is given for approximately 3 months before surgery.&#xD;
