  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to test the effectiveness of a proactive&#xD;
      cardiovascular primary prevention strategy, with or without the use of coronary calcium&#xD;
      screening, compared to current standard care, in preventing future major adverse cardiac&#xD;
      events (MACE), including all-cause death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), stroke, or&#xD;
      any arterial revascularization among a moderate risk population with no current evidence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, open-label, pragmatic study designed to assess the effectiveness of&#xD;
      coronary calcium screening. Patients who provide consent, and are eligible, will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 to receive statin recommendation based on coronary calcium screening results&#xD;
      or standard risk assessment results using the American Heart Association/American College of&#xD;
      Cardiology (AHA/ACC)-recommended pooled cohort equation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Management of all participants will be done through their primary care physicians/clinicians&#xD;
      and their qualified delegates who will receive education and training from the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator and/or his delegate about the two treatment strategies. The current National&#xD;
      guidelines group will be managed following the AHA/ACC guidelines for statin initiation and&#xD;
      follow-up. The coronary artery calcium (CAC) group will undergo coronary artery calcium&#xD;
      screening and will receive a statin recommendation based on the proposed CAC cardiovascular&#xD;
      (CV) risk algorithm. All subjects will be asked to complete the Intermountain Statin&#xD;
      Adherence Questionnaire (ISAQ) at 3 months after recommendation (+ 60 days) and then annually&#xD;
      thereafter (within +/- 60 days of the anniversary date of recommendation). All subjects will&#xD;
      remain under the usual care of their primary care physicians and will be followed by the&#xD;
      study team via their electronic health records (EHR) for approximately an average of 4 years&#xD;
      following the subjects' anniversary date of recommendation, but until the target primary&#xD;
      endpoint event rate is met. All enrolled subjects will be followed for outcomes and this will&#xD;
      be completely done by electronic medical records query. Other than the time point to obtain&#xD;
      agreement for study participation and to perform the CAC screening and/or lipid panel, there&#xD;
      will be no other study-specific clinic visits required. Further, there will be no other&#xD;
      treatments or procedures required for this study. After about the first 600 patients are&#xD;
      enrolled, an interim meeting will occur to evaluate entry criteria and size to determine if&#xD;
      any modifications to the protocol should occur.&#xD;
