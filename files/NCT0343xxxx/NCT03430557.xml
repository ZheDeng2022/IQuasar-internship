      Title : Evaluation of the efficacy of Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) in healing of through and&#xD;
      through lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Bone replacement analogues have been used in the healing after periapical surgery.&#xD;
      It has been a controversial issue to use bone grafts due to varied outcomes of different&#xD;
      studies showing both improved outcomes and no difference. Lacunae while using bone grafts is&#xD;
      their radiopacity which compounds the radiographic incomplete or uncertain healing. Thence we&#xD;
      will be using platelet rich plasma as bone filling material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and Objectives : To evaluate outcome of platelet rich plasma in healing after periapical&#xD;
      surgery for through an through lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Department of Conservative Dentistry and Endodontics, PGIDS, Rohtak, Haryana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time frame: 12-18 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population/participant : Patients of age 16-45 years (male/female) will be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study with diagnosis of through and through lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:- Patients of age 16 -45 years, -ve response to sensibility test, failed&#xD;
      previous rct with purulent discharge, recurrent episode of purulent discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria:- Unrestorable tooth, fractured /perforated roots, serious medical&#xD;
      illness, smokers, pregnant females and lactating mothers, grade 3 mobile teeth, the need for&#xD;
      antibiotic prophylaxis prior to dental care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size - a sample size of 30 patients has been calculated with n=15 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods- Clinically and radiographically diagnosis of lesion, sensibility test by heat, cold,&#xD;
      EPT, preoperative evaluation by bleeding on probing, clinical attachment level, gingival&#xD;
      marginal position &amp; pocket depth. Surgical procedures will be carried out under operating&#xD;
      microscope with 8 ร 16 magnification by following standardized treatment methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures- The primary outcome variables observed for the study will be 3,6,9,12&#xD;
      months clinical and radiographic success rates in terms of resolution of periapical&#xD;
      radiolucency using the same criteria as preoperatively on the radiograph and alleviation of&#xD;
      clinical sign and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis : Intergroup and intra group comparison will be done according to&#xD;
      distribution of data. Categorical data will be analyzed using chi-square test. Regression&#xD;
      analysis will be done to observe any association between dependent and independent variables.&#xD;

&#xD;
        5. Pregnant females and lactating mothers&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Grade 3 mobile teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
      BASELINE PARAMETERS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endodontic evaluation - Pulp sensibility testing will be performed with a combination of heat&#xD;
      test , cold test and electric pulp test. Teeth not responding to both thermal and electric&#xD;
      test will be considered non vital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographic evaluation - Radiographs with paralleling cone technique will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline and at subsequent appointments at standardized exposure parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Periodontal Evaluation - The following clinical parameters will be evaluated at&#xD;
      baseline and at subsequent follow up appointments in the test tooth and the contra lateral&#xD;
      normal tooth in the same patient&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Bleeding on probing - The presence or absence of bleeding following pocket probing will&#xD;
           be recorded at 6 sites per tooth - mesiobuccal, buccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual,&#xD;
           midlingual, distolingual.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Probing pocket depth (PPD) - Probing depth will be measured as the distance from the&#xD;
           gingival margin to the base of the clinical pocket. The probing depth measurements will&#xD;
           be assessed using a calibrated manual periodontal Williams 0 probe. The probe will be&#xD;
           inserted with a firm, gentle pressure to the bottom of the pocket and maintained&#xD;
           parallel to the vertical axis of the tooth. Measurements will be noted at 6 sites per&#xD;
           tooth- mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, distolingual.&#xD;
           Measurements will be rounded to the nearest whole millimeter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical Attachment Level (CAL) - Clinical Attachment Level will be measured as the&#xD;
           distance between the base of the clinical pocket and a fixed point on the crown, the&#xD;
           cementoenamel junction (CEJ). Measurements will be made at 6 sites per tooth-&#xD;
           mesiobuccal, midbuccal, distobuccal, mesiolingual, midlingual, distolingual using&#xD;
           wiliiams 0 probe. Measurements will be rounded to the nearest whole millimeter. The mean&#xD;
           CAL over all examined surfaces will be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Gingival marginal level/position from CEJ will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 30 patients (n=15 in each group) will be included in the study. A power&#xD;
      calculation that was based on the previous data of different studies suggested ta sample size&#xD;
      with 15 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION Patients will be randomly allocated by envelope method into two groups. Group&#xD;
      I=PRP group, group II=Control group (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL TECHNIQUE :&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the exception of incisions, flap elevation and suturing, all surgical procedures will be&#xD;
      performed under operating microscope in an operating room under 8x to 16x magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The full thickness (mucoperiosteal flap) will be reflected under aseptic condition by&#xD;
      technique-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Preoperative mouth rinse with 0.2% chlorhexidine mouthwash will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Local anaesthesia with lidocaine 2% with epinephrine 1:80,000 will be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Buccal intrasulcular incision will be given up to the alveolar crest including one tooth&#xD;
           mesial to the lesion &amp; one tooth distal to the lesion, using no.15 blade on handle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mesial and distal vertical releasing incision will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Full thickness flap will be gently reflected towards the apical area by periosteal&#xD;
           elevator. The flap will be frequently irrigated with sterile saline to prevent&#xD;
           dehydration of periosteal surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After complete elevation of the flap, debridement (periradicular curettage -enucleation)&#xD;
           of the bony lesion will be performed. For additional hemostasis during surgery, cotton&#xD;
           pellets soaked in 0.1% epinephrine will be applied topically as required.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A 2-3mm root tip with a 0ยบ to 10ยบ bevel angle will be sectioned with cylindrical&#xD;
           surgical carbide burs at high speed with sterile water coolant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Root end preparations extending 3mm into the canal space along the long axis of the root&#xD;
           will be made by using a piezoelectric ultrasonic system with double angled Retrotips&#xD;
           coated with Diamond abrasives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Isthmuses, fins, and other significant anatomic irregularities will be identified in&#xD;
           high magnification and will be treated with the ultrasonic instruments. Then the&#xD;
           resected root surfaces will be stained with methylene blue and will be inspected with&#xD;
           micromirrors under high magnification of 24x to examine the cleanliness of the root end&#xD;
           preparation and detect any other overlooked anatomic details.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Root end filling will be done with mineral trioxide aggregrate (MTA). The adaptation of&#xD;
           the filling material to the canal apical walls will be confirmed with the aid of an&#xD;
           operating microscope at high magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. In control group cases wound site will be closed and sutured with 4-0 silk suture after&#xD;
           irrigating the defect properly.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. In test group cases PRP preparation will be performed by procedure described by okuda et&#xD;
           al and hirmath et al. before surgery 8.5 ml blood will be drawn by venipuncture of&#xD;
           anticubital vein and will be collected in 10 ml sterile glass tube coated with&#xD;
           anticoagulant.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Whole blood will be centrifuged (2400rpm for 10 mins) to separate PRP and platelet poor&#xD;
           plasma. PRP and PPP will be centrifuged again to separate PRP from PPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. Fifteen minutes before use of the PRP , the PRP will be rapidly thawed, and a coagulated&#xD;
           preparation of 0.3 mL of PRP will be obtained by its activation. Within a few minutes,&#xD;
           the PRP preparation assumed a sticky gel consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Then PRP will be carried and packed into the defect to the level of defect walls .&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. Wound will then be closed and sutured the same way as control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PLATELET RICH PLASMA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) is the component of blood in which the platelets are concentrated&#xD;
      in a limited volume of plasma .This autologous plasma is a rich source of growth factors and&#xD;
      its application is thought to be an effective way of inducing tissue repair and regeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous studies have shown PRP to be effective at promoting regeneration in both endodontic&#xD;
      and periodontal defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was also speculated that, because of its fibrinogen content, PRP reacts with thrombin and&#xD;
      induces fibrin clot formation, which, in turn, is capable of upregulating collagen synthesis&#xD;
      in the extracellular matrix and provides a favorable scaffold for cellular migration and&#xD;
      adhesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSTOPERATIVE INSTRUCTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be advised to avoid mouth rinsing, hard and hot food, hot drinks, heavy&#xD;
      physical work, and tooth brushing during the day of surgery. Ice packs will be provided after&#xD;
      surgery (10-20 minutes every 1 hour for a total of 3 applications).&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSTOPERATIVE FOLLOW UP:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical and radiographic examinations will be performed every 3, 6 and 12 months by&#xD;
      assessing the same parameters as baseline except that PD will not measured until 12 months.&#xD;
      Routine examination procedure will be used to evaluate any evidence of signs and/or symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs will be taken at 3, 6 and 12th month of follow up. Radiographic healing will be&#xD;
      assessed by the criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Incomplete healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Uncertain healing&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Unsatisfactory healing&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCESSING OF DATA&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter and intra observation of data will be analyzed by distribution of data. Categorical&#xD;
      data will be analyzed by chi square test. Regression analysis will be done to observe any&#xD;
      association between independent and dependent variables. Interobserver/intraobserver&#xD;
      reliability with cohen kappa analysis.&#xD;
