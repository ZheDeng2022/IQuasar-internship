  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study was to analyze the effectiveness of a comprehensive cognitive&#xD;
      remediation program (REHACOP) in the non demented elderly, obtaining improvements in&#xD;
      cognition and functional skills. It was a longitudinal randomized controlled trial with three&#xD;
      assessments: basal, post-treatment, and 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and enrollment were conducted between September 2012 and November 2016. All&#xD;
      participants underwent a clinical interview and an extensive neuropsychological battery.&#xD;
      Patients were randomized in an experimental and a control group. The groups were formed by a&#xD;
      maximum of eight participants run by an experienced therapist. The experimental group&#xD;
      received cognitive remediation for 3 months, 3 times per week, 60 minutes per session. The&#xD;
      control group consisted of occupational group activities (reading the newspaper, drawing,&#xD;
      singing or doing crafts) with the same frequency as the experimental group. Post-treatment&#xD;
      assessment was carried out within the first week after completing the intervention. Finally,&#xD;
      longitudinal follow-up at 12 months with neuropsychological assessments will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To examine the efficacy of a comprehensive cognitive training program (REHACOP) to&#xD;
      improve cognition, clinical symptoms and functional disability for the elderly.&#xD;

      - Neuropsychological assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Premorbid IQ was tested by the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Accentuation Reading Test (TAP). This test estimates the premorbid IQ in Spanish&#xD;
           speakers through 30 words without accentuation which must be read considering its&#xD;
           accentuation. Maximum score of 30 points with higher scores indicating better&#xD;
           performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Readers assessment processes (PROLEC) (Pseudoword reading). Evaluates the reading&#xD;
           ability and the processes that in it intervene. It consists of 40 pseudowords that must&#xD;
           be read correctly as quickly as possible. The scores range from 0 to 40. Higher scores&#xD;
           indicate better performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive Reserve Questionnaire (CRQ). This questionnaire consists of fifteen items that&#xD;
           measure the cognitive reserve and includes questions about education/culture, working&#xD;
           activity, leisure and hobbies, physical activities and social activities. Maximum score&#xD;
           of 26 points with higher scores indicating greater cognitive reserve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cognitive status was tested by the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) determine cognitive status in five categories&#xD;
           (orientation, registration, attention and calculation, recall and language). Maximum&#xD;
           score of 30 points with higher scores indicating greater performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA)* determine cognitive status in nine categories&#xD;
           (visuospatial, executive functioning, naming, memory, attention, language, abstraction,&#xD;
           delayed recall and orientation). Maximum score of 30 points with higher scores&#xD;
           indicating greater performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive status was tested by the following tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Brief Test of Attention (BTA) consists of two parallel forms, numbers and letters,&#xD;
           in which the same 10 sequences of random digits and characters were auditory presented&#xD;
           at the rate of one stimulus per second. Maximum score of 20 points, 10 points per&#xD;
           parallel form. Higher scores indicate greater performance in attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digit Span Test (WAIS-III). Forward Digits is composed with sixteen series of numbers&#xD;
           which have to be repeated in the same order. Maximum score of 16 points with higher&#xD;
           scores indicating greater performance. Backward Digits includes fourteen series of&#xD;
           numbers have to be repeated backwards. Maximum score of 14 points with higher scores&#xD;
           indicating greater performance. These subtests were used to measure attention and&#xD;
           working memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Calibrate Ideational Fluency Assessment (CIFA) measures the verbal fluency of words&#xD;
           beginning with the letter &quot;p&quot; in three minutes and animals and supermarket categories in&#xD;
           1 minute. Higher number of words indicate better performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hopkins Verbal Learning Test Revised (HVLT-R) measures performance in verbal memory,&#xD;
           learning, and long-term recall in which a list of words is read up to three times&#xD;
           (parallel versions 2 and 4 corresponding to basal and post-treatment assessment).&#xD;
           Maximum score of 36 points for learning and 12 points for long-term recall with higher&#xD;
           scores indicating greater performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brief Visual Memory Test Revised (BVMT-R) measures performance in visual memory,&#xD;
           learning and long-term recall (version 1). Six geometric figures are presented three&#xD;
           times. Maximum score of 36 points for learning and 12 points for long-term recall with&#xD;
           higher scores indicating greater performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Taylor Complex Figure Test (TCF)* includes 2 conditions (free drawing and copy). The&#xD;
           total scores range from 0 to 36 points for each condition with higher scores indicating&#xD;
           greater performance in visuoconstructive abilities and visual memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clock Drawing Test (CDT) is used for screening for cognitive impairment and dementia and&#xD;
           as a measure of spatial dysfunction and neglect. This test includes 2 conditions (free&#xD;
           drawing and copy). The total scores range from 0 to 10 points for each part with higher&#xD;
           scores indicating greater performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visual Object and Space Perception Battery (VOSP) is a complex battery. Only two&#xD;
           subtests have been taken into account, incomplete letters and cube analysis. Higher&#xD;
           scores indicating greater performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trail Making Test (TMT-A, TMT-B). Trail Making Test-A consist of twenty-five numbers&#xD;
           have to be ordered from the lowest to the highest in the shortest time possible (i.e.,&#xD;
           1-2-3â€¦).Trail Making Test-B consist of alternating between thirteen numbers and twelve&#xD;
           letters in an ascending sequence. Shorter time indicates better performance in&#xD;
           processing speed and executive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Salthouse Perceptual Comparison Test (SPCT) includes two strings of letters that have to&#xD;
           be compared and marked as different or equal. Maximum score of 64 points with higher&#xD;
           scores indicating greater performance in processing speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stroop Test is composed of three subtests: word-reading, word-color and interference&#xD;
           scores. The examinee has to state the highest number of words or colors in a given time.&#xD;
           Higher points indicate greater performance in executive functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Modified Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (M-WCST)* consists of classifying 48 cards. It is&#xD;
           used for evaluating for executive functioning as well as for mental flexibility. The&#xD;
           performance of the test will depend on the categories completed correctly, perseverative&#xD;
           errors, and total errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to create a neurocognition composite score, all raw scores were converted to&#xD;
      z-scores. The neurocognition composite score was based on the following test and subtest&#xD;
      included in the protocol, that is: BTA total score, total score of the forward digits and&#xD;
      total score of the backward digit of the WAIS-III, total number of word beginning with the&#xD;
      letter &quot;p&quot; in three minutes and total number of words for animals and supermarket categories&#xD;
      in one minute of the CIFA, total score of learning and total score of long-term recall of the&#xD;
      HVLT-R, total score of learning and total score of long-term recall of the BVMT-R, total&#xD;
      score of the free drawing of the CDT, total score of letters and total score of the cube&#xD;
      analysis of the VOSP, time of the TMT-A, total score of the SPCT, and total score of the&#xD;
      word-color trial of the Stroop Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All raw scores were converted to z-scores. TMT-A score was adjusted so that higher scores&#xD;
      indicated better cognitive performance. The z-scores were pooled into composite score with&#xD;
      the average of the tests and subtest mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      - MOCA*, TCF*, and M-WCST* tests were added to the protocol after starting the study. TCF and&#xD;
      M-WCST were not included to calculate the neurocognition composite score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical variables, functional variables and subjective complaints were measured by the&#xD;
      following tests. Raw scores were used in order to facilitate clinical interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Geriatric Depression Scale (GDS-15) includes 15 items. Higher scores indicate a higher&#xD;
           degree of depression (range from 0 to 15 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neuropsychiatric Inventory Questionnaire (NPI-Q) includes 10 neuropsychiatric domains&#xD;
           (delusions, hallucinations, agitation/aggression, depression/dysphoria, anxiety,&#xD;
           euphoria, apathy, disinhibition, irritability, and aberrant motor behavior) assessed in&#xD;
           terms of severity and frequency in a range from 0 to 120 points. Higher scores indicate&#xD;
           greater neuropsychiatric behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lille Apathy Rating Scale (LARS) is composed by 33 items, subdivided into 9 subscales&#xD;
           (everyday productivity, interests, taking initiative, novelty seeking/motivation,&#xD;
           emotional responses, concern, social life, and self-awareness). These subscales are&#xD;
           summed into a total score with a possible range from -36 to 36 points. Lower scores&#xD;
           indicate a higher degree of apathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory (MFI) is composed by 20 items divided into 5&#xD;
           subscales (general index, physical fatigue, mental fatigue, lack of motivation, lack of&#xD;
           activity). Higher scores indicate greater fatigue (range from 0 to 140 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Satisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS). This scale is composed by 5 items. Higher scores&#xD;
           indicate greater live satisfaction (range from 0 to 35 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective complains were assessed by Subjective Questionnaire on Cognitive and&#xD;
           Functional Complains of the patient and caregivers. These questionnaires are composed by&#xD;
           40 items each one of them. Higher scores indicate greater subjective complains (range&#xD;
           from 0 to 120 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Description of the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      REHACOP is a comprehensive cognitive remediation program structured in cognitive domains and&#xD;
      three levels of difficulty. It is theoretically based on strategies of cognitive&#xD;
      rehabilitation (restoration, compensation and optimization). REHACOP uses mainly a bottom-up&#xD;
      approach in such a way that it begins with the simplest cognitive domains and ends with the&#xD;
      most complex domains and top-down strategies to help with generalization of abilities in&#xD;
      daily life. It contains more than 300 paper and pencil tasks, hierarchically structured in 4&#xD;
      modules of cognition (attention and concentration, learning and memory, language and&#xD;
      executive functioning), 3 modules of functionality (social cognition, social skills and&#xD;
      activities of daily living) and a module of psychoeducation. In this study we used a modified&#xD;
      version of REHACOP for the elderly. The REHACOP group received cognitive remediation sessions&#xD;
      3 times per week for 3 months 60 minutes per session. The remediation sessions were performed&#xD;
      in the actual homes for the elderly. The groups were made up of a maximum of 8 participants.&#xD;
      In particular, the rehabilitation of the REHACOP group consisted of 39 sessions divided into:&#xD;
      attention and concentration unit (sustained, selective, alternating, and divided attention) 4&#xD;
      weeks; learning and memory unit (verbal and visual memory and learning strategies) 3 weeks;&#xD;
      language (verbal fluency, syntax, grammar, vocabulary, and comprehension) 3 weeks; executive&#xD;
      functioning (objectives planning and attainment, verbal reasoning, categorization, and&#xD;
      conceptualization) and processing speed were trained transversely during the sessions. This&#xD;
      study did not apply the remaining modules (social cognition, social skills, daily living&#xD;
      activities and psychoeducation).&#xD;
