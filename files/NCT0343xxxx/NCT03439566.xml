    <textblock>
      This study wishes to investigate if pain by peripheral venous cannulation (PVC)&#xD;
      preoperatively, will predict pain levels after 24 h postoperatively. Furthermore, to&#xD;
      investigate moderate/severe pain at the postoperatively at the post-anaesthesia care unit&#xD;
      (PACU) is associated with increased late (24h) pain. Additionally, if the PACU nurse is able&#xD;
      to predict if the patient will be a high pain responder, by using a clinical judgement.&#xD;
      Finally to evaluate the patient's pain-levels at home after discharge and investigate for&#xD;
      associations between postoperative pain and post-discharge pain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative pain remains insufficiently treated in clinically relevant proportions of&#xD;
      patients across procedures, but with varying incidences. Preoperative identification of&#xD;
      patients at risk for increased postoperative pain may result in stratification of&#xD;
      perioperative analgesic protocols, aiming at reducing pain in high-risk patients while&#xD;
      avoiding over-treatment in those at low-risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several potential patient-related factors have been suggested as associated with an increased&#xD;
      risk of higher postoperative pain levels. Studies indicate a positive correlation between&#xD;
      postoperative pain levels and e.g. preoperative pain levels, gender, age and&#xD;
      socioeconomically and psychological variables. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS), has been&#xD;
      used to look for associations between psychological variables and levels of early and late&#xD;
      pain as well. However, no firm data exist for a clinically useful identification of&#xD;
      individual high pain responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative sensory testing of patient's nociception has the potential to predict&#xD;
      postoperative pain levels. However, a review dealing with the prediction of postoperative&#xD;
      pain based on experimental pain studies demonstrated that quantitative sensory testing was&#xD;
      only able to predict 4 - 54% of the variance of the postoperative pain of individual&#xD;
      patients. Another recent study of clinically applicable tests suggested that relevant&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity can be achieved, but this has not been translated into clinical&#xD;
      practice or confirmed. Thus, no preoperative testing method has proven clinically relevant or&#xD;
      useful until now.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A newer pragmatic clinical study indicated that the pain intensity associated with peripheral&#xD;
      venous cannulation (PVC) could be used as a simple predictor of the magnitude of early pain&#xD;
      levels at one hour postoperatively at the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU). That study,&#xD;
      however, did not test the possible association between venepuncture related pain and later&#xD;
      pain levels at 24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another simple method for early identification of those with an intensified need of pain&#xD;
      treatment after PACU discharge could be to investigate if higher pain levels early&#xD;
      postoperatively at the PACU are associated with higher levels of late postoperative pain.&#xD;
      Especially, we find it relevant at the individual patient level to investigate if NRS below 3&#xD;
      (moderate/severe pain) in the early postoperative phase at the PACU is associated with NRS&#xD;
      levels above 3 late postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Also, it could be relevant to investigate if the PACU-nurses, based on their clinical&#xD;
      evaluation, are able to predict if the patient would experience an increased risk of&#xD;
      moderate/severe pain after PACU discharge. Such a simple clinical tool of staff's judgement&#xD;
      of risk of postoperative pain levels has never been tested before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that levels of early and late pain are associated and with a simple&#xD;
      clinical related tool it could be possible to identify patients with increased pain levels at&#xD;
      24-hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With updated fast-track perioperative patient causes, patients often are discharged quickly&#xD;
      after the surgical procedure. Often there may be a lack of knowledge on how they manage to&#xD;
      return to daily living. Pain can be a major problem for the patients, possibly also at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even though one cannot be certain that patients with severe pain, will contact the hospital&#xD;
      after discharge. Not only can pain delay rehabilitation it can also be a major factor for&#xD;
      developing chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is relevant to monitor the patient's pain-levels, quality of sleep, mood, as&#xD;
      well as analgesic use and side-effects at home, using a diary from discharge until 5 days&#xD;
      postoperatively. Especially, to investigate if patients with higher postoperative pain levels&#xD;
      also experience excess pain-related problems after discharge.&#xD;
