  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test if treatment with medications that reduce the male&#xD;
      hormone level in the participant's body for a few months before surgery can shrink prostate&#xD;
      cancer as much as possible, which might reduce the chances of the cancer coming back in the&#xD;
      future. These treatments include a hormone injection given monthly or every three months and&#xD;
      the study drugs, which include abiraterone acetate, prednisone, and apalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These medications are being used in combination with surgery and maybe radiotherapy because&#xD;
      studies have shown that any single approach on its own is not sufficient to control or get&#xD;
      rid of the cancer especially if they have high risk or aggressive features. The researchers&#xD;
      hope to learn if combining the study drugs with surgery and radiation will get rid of the&#xD;
      cancer from participants' prostates and reduce their prostate-specific antigen (PSA) to an&#xD;
      undetectable level.&#xD;
