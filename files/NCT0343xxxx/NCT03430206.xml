  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      THRIVE (Transnasal Humidified Rapid-Insufflation Ventilatory Exchange) refers to the use of&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannula to augment the ability to oxygenate and ventilate a patient under&#xD;
      general anesthesia. The use of high-flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation during&#xD;
      anesthesia for surgical procedures has been a recent development in the adult population,&#xD;
      with limited data analyzing the pediatric population. This study will determine whether high&#xD;
      flow nasal cannula oxygen supplementation during surgical or endoscopic procedures can safely&#xD;
      prevent desaturation events in children under anesthesia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing select procedures in the LPCH operating rooms or ambulatory procedure&#xD;
      unit, as identified by review of the daily schedule will be reviewed for potential study&#xD;
      enrollment. Study personnel will work with preoperative nurses to identify potential&#xD;
      participants. When potential candidates are identified, the investigators will discuss with&#xD;
      the surgeon or proceduralist and request that he/she talk with patients about study&#xD;
      participation to introduce the idea. On the day of surgery, potential subjects will arrive to&#xD;
      preoperative intake areas and proceed through the usual preoperative processes. Once in the&#xD;
      preoperative intake area, potential participants will be approached by study personnel at&#xD;
      least 30 minutes prior to their scheduled procedure for further explanation of the study and&#xD;
      obtaining consent and assent. At this time, potential subjects will be evaluated for interval&#xD;
      changes in health that may exclude them from the study. A random number generator will be&#xD;
      used to enroll participants into either the usual care (control) or THRIVE (treatment) arm.&#xD;
      Control subjects will undergo their scheduled procedure and recovery with the usual care.&#xD;
      Treatment subjects will undergo the scheduled procedure, with the difference being that a&#xD;
      high-flow nasal cannula will be applied prior to the start of the procedure and removed&#xD;
      following the procedure's conclusion. While applied, the cannula will deliver high- flow rate&#xD;
      oxygen, air, or a mixture of variable oxygen concentration (21-100%) depending on the&#xD;
      surgical conditions and requirements. The rate will be set at 1-2L/kg/min with a maximum of&#xD;
      70L/min. Participants in the treatment arm will then proceed to the recovery area as usual.&#xD;
      Following recovery from anesthesia, a brief questionnaire will be provided to applicable&#xD;
      patients or their parents/guardians/representatives. The intraoperative vital signs and&#xD;
      post-operative course will be analyzed with any patient data stored in a deidentified manner&#xD;
      on Stanford- compliant encrypted devices.&#xD;
