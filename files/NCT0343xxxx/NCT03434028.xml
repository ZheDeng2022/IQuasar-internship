      Multicenter, prospective, phase 3 randomized non-blinded interventional trial of fluid&#xD;
      treatment strategies in the first 24 hours for patients with sepsis-induced hypotension. The&#xD;
      aim of the study is to determine the impact of a restrictive fluids strategy (vasopressors&#xD;
      first followed by rescue fluids) as compared to a liberal fluid strategy (fluids first&#xD;
      followed by rescue vasopressors) on 90-day in-hospital mortality in patients with&#xD;
      sepsis-induced hypotension.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary Hypothesis: Restrictive (vs liberal) fluid treatment strategy during the first 24&#xD;
      hours of resuscitation for sepsis-induced hypotension will reduce 90-day in-hospital&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will emphasize early screening and protocol initiation, and enroll a maximum of 2320&#xD;
           patients with suspected sepsis-induced hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients will receive at least 1 liter of fluids prior to meeting study&#xD;
                inclusion criteria (and no more than 3 liters prior to randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients will be enrolled within 4 hours of meeting study inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any type of isotonic crystalloid (normal saline, ringers lactate, or a balanced&#xD;
                solution such as plasmalyte) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Restrictive Fluids (Early Vasopressors) Group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Norepinephrine will be used as preferred vasopressor and titrated to achieve mean&#xD;
                arterial pressure (MAP) between 65 mmHg and 75 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;Rescue fluids&quot; may be administered as 500ml boluses if predefined rescue criteria&#xD;
                are met&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Liberal Fluids (Fluids First)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  2 liter infusion upon enrollment (may forego second liter if MAP/SBP and heart rate&#xD;
                are normalized and clinical assessment if patient is fluid replete after the first&#xD;
                liter).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Administer 500ml fluid boluses for fluid triggers until 5 liters administered or&#xD;
                development of clinical signs of acute volume overload develop&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  &quot;Rescue vasopressors&quot; may be administered after 5 liters of fluid, for development&#xD;
                of acute volume overload, or if other predefined rescue criteria are met&#xD;

Patients on chronic renal replacement therapy will not be eligible for this endpoint determination.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in SOFA score</measure>
    <time_frame>72 hours after randomization</time_frame>
    <description>We will calculate the SOFA score upon enrollment and at 72 hours using clinically available data. If a value is not available at baseline, it will be assumed to be normal. At the 72 hours assessment, if a value is missing then we will carry forward the closet previously known value. If a patient is intubated or heavily sedated at either 0 or 72 hours, the GCS will be omitted when calculating the change in score. If a patient was on renal replacement therapy prior to presentation, then the renal dysfunction component to the SOFA score will be omitted as well.</description>
