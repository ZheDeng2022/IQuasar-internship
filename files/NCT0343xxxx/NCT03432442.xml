      Design and Outcomes This research study is designed as open-label, sequential dose-escalating&#xD;
      clinical trial. There will be two phases of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first phase, pediatric dengue patients with body weight greater than 30 kg will be&#xD;
      recruited. The first six volunteers will be administered with 400 μg/kg every 24 hours for a&#xD;
      total of three times. The last six volunteers will be administered with 600 μg/kg every 24&#xD;
      hours for a total of three times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second phase, pediatric dengue patients with body weight between 15 to 30 kg will be&#xD;
      recruited. Similar to the first phase, the first six and the last six volunteers will be&#xD;
      administered with 400 μg/kg and 600 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of three times,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 24 volunteers will be recruited from Faculty of Medicine Siriraj hospitals&#xD;

      The research team has planned to conduct three interim analyses for safety and one final&#xD;
      report. The interim analyses will be conducted as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. First interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with&#xD;
           body weight &gt;30 kg receiving ivermectin 400 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of three&#xD;
           times (i.e. the sixth volunteer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Second interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with&#xD;
           body weight &gt;30 kg receiving ivermectin 600 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of three&#xD;
           times (i.e. the twelfth volunteer).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Third interim analysis: After the completion of the last volunteer of the group with&#xD;
           body weight 15 to 30 kg receiving ivermectin 400 μg/kg every 24 hours for a total of&#xD;
           three times (i.e. the twelfth volunteer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of each interim analyses will be submitted to DSMB to determine whether the study&#xD;
      is safe to be conducted in the next group of volunteers. Additionally, the results of interim&#xD;
      analyses and the safety assessments from DSMB will be submitted to all ECs&#xD;
