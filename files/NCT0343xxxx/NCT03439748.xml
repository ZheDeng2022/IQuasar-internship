  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Affect, or the tendency to experience a given emotion, often is subdivided into two domains.&#xD;
      Positive affect is the tendency to experience positive emotions, such as happiness,&#xD;
      excitement, elation, and enthusiasm. Negative affect is the tendency to experience negative&#xD;
      emotions, such as anger, resentment, sadness, anxiety, and fear. Humans exhibit a range of&#xD;
      emotions that span across positive and negative affect domains with some individuals&#xD;
      experiencing more of one type of affect than another. Recent research and developing theories&#xD;
      have suggested that mental health disorders can be conceptualized as the tendency for an&#xD;
      individual to fall into one or more extremes on these categories. Therefore, treatments&#xD;
      should not be based on targeting a conglomeration of symptoms (as we have been doing for the&#xD;
      past century) but rather they should be treating the underlying dysregulation (e.g., high or&#xD;
      low positive and negative affect).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an effort to address this gap, the current study plans to recruit participants for a&#xD;
      treatment trial consisting of two psychotherapies: (a) positive affect treatment (PAT), and&#xD;
      (b) negative affect treatment (NAT). The overarching goal of this project are to evaluate the&#xD;
      target (i.e. potential mechanisms) of PAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized to either a 15-week positive (PAT) or negative affect&#xD;
      treatment (NAT). Participants will also complete four laboratory visits (before treatment,&#xD;
      during treatment (two times), and at post-treatment) to measure potential targets or&#xD;
      mediators of PAT. These laboratory-based assessments will included measures of the positive&#xD;
      affect system such as behavioral, subjective, and psychophysiological responses to reward,&#xD;
      anticipation and motivation, reward attainment, and reward learning.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Anhedonia, or loss of interest or pleasure in usual activities, is characteristic of&#xD;
      depression, some types of anxiety, as well as substance abuse and schizophrenia. Anhedonia is&#xD;
      a predictor of poor long-term outcomes, including suicide, and poor treatment response.&#xD;
      Extant psychological and pharmacological treatments are relatively ineffective for anhedonia.&#xD;
      Thus, there is an unmet therapeutic need for this high-risk symptom. Recent advances in&#xD;
      affective neuroscience have elucidated processes that may underlie anhedonia and should be&#xD;
      targeted in therapy. Specifically, anhedonia is associated with deficits in the appetitive&#xD;
      reward system, including (1) reward approach-motivation, (2) initial responsiveness to reward&#xD;
      attainment, and (3) learning of reward. We have developed a novel transdiagnostic&#xD;
      psychosocial treatment for anhedonia, Positive Affect Treatment (PAT), designed to improve&#xD;
      deficits in reward sensitivity. The goal of the current study is to evaluate the targets of&#xD;
      this new treatment, PAT, and whether the targets are specific to PAT relative to traditional&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral therapy designed to reduce negative affect, called Negative Affect&#xD;
      Treatment (NAT), in individuals with depression or anxiety.&#xD;
