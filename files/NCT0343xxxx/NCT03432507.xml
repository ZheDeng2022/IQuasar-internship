      All patients scheduled for lumbar spine surgery due to discogenic low back pain and/or&#xD;
      sciatica, will be screened by the principal investigator for presence of inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria. Their baseline neurological function before surgery will be assessed and recorded&#xD;
      for recruitment into one of the three study groups. MRI scans will be assessed for the&#xD;
      calculation of disc protrusion size. Experimental sensory and pain assessments and&#xD;
      questionnaires will be performed at list 24 hours before surgery. Blood sample for&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory mediator will be obtained at the same time as the experimental sensory and&#xD;
      pain tests. Pre-operative pain and MPQ will be assessed pre-operatively (back and leg pain&#xD;
      separately), and again on day 30 after surgery. Blood tests for ESR, CRP will be drawn before&#xD;
      surgery, during the surgery, and on 30 after surgery. During surgery, intervertebral disc&#xD;
      material will be harvested and divided into 4 specimens for culture and inflammatory mediator&#xD;
      analysis. Repeat neurological assessment will be performed 30 after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The clinical manifestation of disc degeneration and/or disc herniation can be low back pain&#xD;
      and/or sciatica. The patterns of sensory and motor signs and symptoms that develop after&#xD;
      neuropathy vary between individual patients with disc degeneration and/or disc herniation.&#xD;
      The expression of these sensory signs (hyperalgesia, allodynia, and sensory loss), which we&#xD;
      call the individual somatosensory profile, reflects pathophysiological mechanisms in damaged&#xD;
      and surviving afferent nerve fibers such as conduction block, ectopic impulse generation,&#xD;
      peripheral sensitization, and central sensitization. In addition, studies have been conducted&#xD;
      in search of a microbial origin responsible for the observed inflammatory reaction in&#xD;
      discogenic low back pain and sciatica. However, the studies tested mixed cohorts of patients&#xD;
      in terms of clinical symptoms (low back pain alone, sciatica, both), length of symptoms&#xD;
      (acute and chronic), and tissue cultured (disc, bone). We hypothesize that the possible&#xD;
      infectious etiology of the observed inflammatory reaction seen in acute disc herniation and&#xD;
      sciatica may be different from that of chronic low back pain due to disc degeneration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We further suspect that the immununogenicity of an acute disc herniation causing neurological&#xD;
      deficit may be different from a similar disc herniation not causing a deficit, and still&#xD;
      different from chronic degenerated discs without herniation or neurological deficit. Despite&#xD;
      the frequent occurrence of low back pain and sciatica in the general population their&#xD;
      underling mechanisms are poorly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims and hypotheses of study&#xD;
&#xD;
      (1) To test the differences in disc microbial cultures and in levels of disc and blood&#xD;
      cytokines, between patients suffering disc degeneration / herniation and spinal stenosis&#xD;
      (controls), and (2) to assess the relationship between clinical manifestations and sensory&#xD;
      profiles of these patients and levels of cytokines found in disc tissue and blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ouer hypotheses are: (1) patients suffering from disc degeneration / herniation or spinal&#xD;
      stenosis will differ in microbial culture and cytokines levels, with higher levels of&#xD;
      positive microbial disc culture and cytokines in the disc herniation group, (2) proinflamtory&#xD;
      cytokines levels will correlate with hyperalgesic (rather than hypoalgesic) sensory profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      200 adult subjects suffering from radicular pain duo to disc degeneration / herniation or&#xD;
      spinal stenosis will be recruited from the orthopedic clinic at the Rambam Health Care&#xD;
      Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental sensory and pain assessments will include a set of non-painful and pain evoked&#xD;
      tests which assess sensory integrity and pain perception to thermal (heat and cold) and&#xD;
      mechanical (vibration fork, pressure algometer and Von Frey Filaments) stimulation and an&#xD;
      assessment of the pain modulation processes: (1) conditioned pain modulation (CPM)- a&#xD;
      phenomenon whereby the response to a given noxious test stimulus is attenuated by another&#xD;
      conditioning noxious stimulus which is simultaneously administered in a remote area of the&#xD;
      body; (2) temporal summation (TS)- the experimental equivalent of 'windup. The tests will be&#xD;
      performed over the skin of the painful area (back and leg) and over the same areas of the&#xD;
      non-painful contralateral side. Clinical pain assessments will be based on the evaluation of&#xD;
      pain intensity on a daily pain diary as well as on a pain questionnaire (Short-Form McGill&#xD;
      Pain Questionnaire (SF-MPQ)); Thermal detection and pain thresholds and the number of&#xD;
      paradoxical heat sensations The thermal tests will be performed using the TSA II (MEDOC,&#xD;
      Israel). Cold and warm detection thresholds will be measured first (CDT, WDT). In addition,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked about paradoxical heat sensations (PHS) during the thermal sensory&#xD;
      limen (TSL) procedure of alternating warm and cold stimuli. Then cold pain and heat pain&#xD;
      thresholds will be determined (CPT, HPT). The mean threshold temperature of three consecutive&#xD;
      measurements will be calculated. All thresholds will be obtained with ramped stimuli (1°C/s)&#xD;
      that will be terminated when the subject presses a button. The baseline temperature will be&#xD;
      32°C and the contact area of the thermode will be 3x3 cm2. Cut-off temperatures will be 0°C&#xD;
      and 50°C&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical detection and pain threshold The mechanical detection threshold (MDT) will be&#xD;
      measured with a standardized set of von Frey hairs (Optihair2-Set, Marstock Nervtest,&#xD;
      Germany) that exert forces upon bending between 0.25 and 512 mN (1-2s contact time). The&#xD;
      contact area of the von Frey hairs with the skin will be of uniform size and shape (rounded&#xD;
      tip, 0.5 mm in diameter) to avoid sharp edges that would facilitate nociceptor activation.&#xD;
      Using the ''method of limits'', five threshold determinations will be made, each with a&#xD;
      series of ascending and descending stimulus intensities. The final threshold will be the&#xD;
      geometric mean of these five series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mechanical pain threshold (MPT) will be measured using a standardized set of von Frey&#xD;
      hairs. The stimulators will be applied at a rate of 2s on, 2s off in an ascending order until&#xD;
      the first percept of sharpness will be reached. The final threshold will be the geometric&#xD;
      mean of five series of ascending and descending stimuli. This test will be designed to detect&#xD;
      pinprick hypoalgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulus/response-functions: mechanical pain sensitivity for pinprick stimuli and dynamic&#xD;
      mechanical allodynia Mechanical pain sensitivity (MPS) will be assessed using the von Frey&#xD;
      hair with the strongest force (512 mN). Subjects will be asked to give a pain rating for 35&#xD;
      stimulus on a '0-100' numerical rating scale ('0' indicating ''no pain'', and '100'&#xD;
      indicating ''most intense pain imaginable'').&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic mechanical allodynia (ALL) will be assessed using a set of three light tactile&#xD;
      stimulators as moving innocuous stimuli: Cotton wisp exerting a force of 3 mN, a cotton wool&#xD;
      tip fixed to an elastic strip exerting a force of 100 mN, and a standardized brush exerting a&#xD;
      force of 200-400 mN. The tactile stimuli will be applied with a single stroke of&#xD;
      approximately 2 cm in length over the skin. Fifteen stimuli will be given (five per stimulus&#xD;
      type). All stimuli will be applied with a 10s inter-stimulus interval - well below the&#xD;
      critical frequency for wind-up. Mechanical pain sensitivity will be calculated as the&#xD;
      geometric mean of all numerical ratings for pinprick stimuli. Dynamic mechanical allodynia&#xD;
      will be calculated as the geometric mean (compound measure) of all numerical ratings across&#xD;
      all three different types of light touch stimulators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wind-up ratio representing the perceptual correlate of temporal pain summation In this test,&#xD;
      the perceived intensity of a single pinprick (256 mN) will be compared with that of a series&#xD;
      of 10 repetitive pinprick stimuli of the same physical intensity (1/s applied within an area&#xD;
      of 1 cm2). The subject will be asked to give a pain rating representing the single stimulus,&#xD;
      and the estimated mean over the whole series of 10 stimuli using a '0-100' numerical rating&#xD;
      scale. The whole procedure will be repeated five times. Wind-up ratio (WUR) will be&#xD;
      calculated as the ratio: mean rating of the five series divided by the mean rating of the&#xD;
      five single stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vibration detection threshold The vibration detection threshold (VDT) represents the only&#xD;
      disappearance threshold within the proposed QST battery. This test will be performed with a&#xD;
      Rydel-Seiffer grade tuning fork (64 Hz, 8/8 scale) that will be placed over a bony prominence&#xD;
      (lateral or medial malleolus) and left there until the subject could not feel vibration any&#xD;
      more. Vibration detection threshold will be determined as a disappearance threshold with&#xD;
      three stimulus repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pressure pain threshold (PPT) The final test in the protocol will be performed over muscle in&#xD;
      the painful limb with a pressure gauge device (FDN200, Wagner Instruments, USA) with a probe&#xD;
      area of 1 cm2 (probe diameter of 1.1 cm) that exerts forces up to 20 kg/cm2. The pressure&#xD;
      pain threshold will be determined with three series of ascending stimulus intensities, each&#xD;
      applied as a slowly increasing ramp of 0.5 kg/cm2 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporal summation of heat pain Noxious heat stimuli will be given to the painful site. The&#xD;
      tonic heat pain (THP) stimulation will be applied using the 3 X 3 cm Peltier based&#xD;
      computerized thermal stimulator (TSA, Medoc Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel). The baseline&#xD;
      temperature will be 32ºC and increase at a rate of 2ºC/sec up to a destination temperature of&#xD;
      46.5ºC and will last for 2 minutes. Participants, unaware of the temperature, will be&#xD;
      instructed to verbally rate the pain intensity every 10 sec using the numeric pain scale&#xD;
      (NPS; &quot;0&quot; meaning 'no pain', &quot;100&quot;- 'worst pain imaginable'). The average pain ratings will&#xD;
      be calculated. Temporal summation of heat pain will be defined and calculated as a&#xD;
      subtraction of the sixth pain rating (after one minute) from the last pain rating (after two&#xD;
      minutes). Hence, a positive value indicates a temporal summation process, and a negative&#xD;
      value indicates an adaptation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conditioned pain modulation paradigm For assessment of the DNIC efficiency heat&#xD;
      stimulation will be delivered using the 3 X 3 cm Peltier based computerized thermal&#xD;
      stimulator (TSA, Medoc Ltd, Ramat Yishai, Israel). The baseline temperature will be 32ºC and&#xD;
      increase at a rate of 2ºC/sec up to a destination temperature of 46.5ºC and for a duration of&#xD;
      5sec. Patients will verbally report the level of pain intensity using the numeric pain scale&#xD;
      (NPS; &quot;0&quot; meaning 'no pain', &quot;100&quot;- 'worst pain imaginable'). This will be considered as&#xD;
      'baseline test pain' (baseline). Then patients will be asked to immerse their dominant hand&#xD;
      into a temperature-controlled (10 ºC) water bath (Heto CBN 8-30 Lab equipment, Allerod,&#xD;
      Denmark) with a maximum temperature variance of ± 0.5°C, which is continuously stirred by a&#xD;
      pump. Following 15 seconds of immersion, while the hand is still in the water bath, a second&#xD;
      and third test stimulations will delivered with 15 seconds interval between them, and pain&#xD;
      intensity will be recorded again. Two additional heat stimulations will be delivered 15 and&#xD;
      30 seconds subsequent to removal of the hand from the water bath. Upon completion of the&#xD;
      session, patients will be instructed to report the intensity of the pain that will be caused&#xD;
      by immersing the hand in the water bath (conditioning induced pain intensity). DNIC&#xD;
      efficiency will by calculated and define as subtraction of pain ratings of the test stimulus&#xD;
      alone from the mean pain ratings of the test stimulus during hand immersion. Thus, negative&#xD;
      value indicates greater DNIC efficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires SF-MPQ: Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire The main component of the SF-MPQ&#xD;
      consists of 15 descriptors (11 sensory; 4 affective) which are rated on an intensity scale as&#xD;
      0 = none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate or 3 = severe. Three pain scores are derived from the sum of&#xD;
      the intensity rank values of the words chosen for sensory, affective and total descriptors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain related questionnaires Psychological and personality factors known to influence pain&#xD;
      perception will be assessed: pain catastrophizing and state and trait anxiety. Assessment&#xD;
      will be completed using three questionnaires: (I) The pain catastrophizing scale (PCS),&#xD;
      comprised of 13 statements evaluating three dimensions of pain catastrophizing: rumination,&#xD;
      magnification and helplessness. Participants will be instructed to rate their agreement with&#xD;
      each statement on a scale between 0-4 (0 = &quot;never&quot;, 1 = &quot;almost never&quot;, 2 = &quot;occasionally&quot;, 3&#xD;
      = &quot;almost often&quot;, 4 = &quot;often&quot;). The questionnaire score is defined as the sum of all ratings&#xD;
      with a high score indicating high pain catastrophizing levels. (II) Spielberger's state-trait&#xD;
      anxiety inventory (STAI) that includes two sections each evaluating two distinct features of&#xD;
      anxiety: state and trait anxiety. Each section constructed of 20 sentences describing&#xD;
      emotional states. Participants will be instructed to rate their emotions about each sentence&#xD;
      on a scale between 1-4 (1 = &quot;not at all&quot;, 2 = &quot;slightly&quot;, 3 = &quot;moderately&quot; 4 = &quot;highly&quot;). The&#xD;
      questionnaires score is defined as a sum of all ratings after inverting several specific&#xD;
      items, when a high score indicates high levels of state/trait anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oswestry Low Back Pain Disability Questionnaire The purpose of the Oswestry Low Back Pain&#xD;
      Disability Questionnaire is to assess pain-related disability in persons with low back pain.&#xD;
      The questionnaire consists of 10 items addressing different aspects of function. Each item is&#xD;
      scored from 0 to 5, with higher values representing greater disability. The total score is&#xD;
      multiplied by 2 and expressed as a percentage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DN4 The DN4 questionnaire consists of 10 items. The first 7 items are related to pain&#xD;
      characteristics and sensations and the remaining 3 items are related to the examination. For&#xD;
      each item, a score of ''1'' is given if the answer is ''yes'' and a score of ''0'' is given&#xD;
      if it is ''no.'' The patient is defined to have neuropathic pain if the sum of all 10 items&#xD;
      is calculated to be 4 or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Levels of proinflammatory factors in blood and disc tissue Proinflammatory cytokines (IL-1b,&#xD;
      IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, TNF-a, INF-g) will be assessed in blood and disc tissue samples obtained&#xD;
      at the time of surgery using ProcartaPlex Multiplex Immunoassay and real-time polymerase&#xD;
      chain reaction (PCR). All assessments, coding and tissue storage will be held in the&#xD;
      Pathology Laboratory at Rambam healthcare campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue culture results To minimize the risk of contamination, the surgeon will perform all&#xD;
      processing and culturing procedures intraoperatively, and under stringent, sterile, operating&#xD;
      theater conditions. During surgery, immediately following intervertebral disc removal, the&#xD;
      surgeon will dissect the disc material into 4 proximately equal pieces. PCR method will be&#xD;
      used for detection and identification of several bacterial strains from dissected&#xD;
      intra-vertebral discs. All assessments, coding and tissue storage will be held in the&#xD;
      Microbiology Laboratory at Rambam healthcare campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI scans of enrolled patients, which are performed regardless to this study protocol, will&#xD;
      be evaluated for area and size of the disc protrusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor examination will be performed using the American Spinal Injury Association (ASIA) score&#xD;
      of neurologic assessment. This score will be tested on five muscles in the affected side of&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength is graded as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  0 Total paralysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 - Palpable or visible contraction&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  2 - Active movement, full range of motion, gravity eliminated&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 - Active movement, full range of motion, against gravity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  4 - Active movement, full range of motion, against gravity and provides some resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  5 - Active movement, full range of motion, against gravity and provides normal&#xD;
           resistance [Muscle able to exert, in examiner's judgement, sufficient resistance to be&#xD;
           considered normal if identifiable inhibiting factors were not present]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NT - not testable. Patient unable to reliably exert effort or muscle unavailable for&#xD;
           testing due to factors such as immobilization, pain on effort or contracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure All patients scheduled for lumbar spine surgery due to discogenic low back&#xD;
      pain and/or sciatica, will be screened by the principal investigator for presence of&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria. Their baseline neurological function before surgery will be&#xD;
      assessed and recorded for recruitment into one of the three study groups. MRI scans will be&#xD;
      assessed for the calculation of disc protrusion size. Experimental sensory and pain&#xD;
      assessments and questionnaires will be performed at list 24 hours before surgery. Blood&#xD;
      sample for pro-inflammatory mediator will be obtained at the same time as the experimental&#xD;
      sensory and pain tests. Pre-operative pain and MPQ will be assessed pre-operatively (back and&#xD;
      leg pain separately), and again on day 30 after surgery. Blood tests for ESR, CRP will be&#xD;
      drawn before surgery, during the surgery, and on 30 after surgery. During surgery,&#xD;
      intervertebral disc material will be harvested and divided into 4 specimens for culture and&#xD;
      inflammatory mediator analysis. Repeat neurological assessment will be performed 30 after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
