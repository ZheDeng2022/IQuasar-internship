      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate the dose response relationship of SAR425899 compared to placebo on resolution&#xD;
      of non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) with no worsening of fibrosis in diabetic and&#xD;
      non-diabetic patients with histopathologically-confirmed NASH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of SAR425899 on overall non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD)&#xD;
           activity score (NAS), individual components of NAS (steatosis, hepatocyte ballooning,&#xD;
           and lobular inflammation), and fibrosis score.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess to the effect of SAR425899 on MRI-PDFF (Magnetic Resonance Imaging-determined&#xD;
           Proton Density Fat Fraction) derived parameters (total liver fat, liver volume, and&#xD;
           fractional liver fat content).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of SAR425889 on body weight and waist/hip circumference ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess SAR425899 pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess safety and tolerability of SAR425899.&#xD;
