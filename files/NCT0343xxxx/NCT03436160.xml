    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, randomized, fixed-sequence, microdose study of three Carbon-14 radio&#xD;
      labeled (14C) triazine compounds WR826647, WR909388, WR909390 designed in accordance with ICH&#xD;
      Guidance for Industry M3(R2) (ICH 2009). Subjects will be randomized to one of three groups&#xD;
      to receive 100 mcg WR826647, WR909388, or WR909390 at an exposure no greater than 250 nCi per&#xD;
      dose, administered both IV (bolus) and PO with a six half-life wash-out period between IV and&#xD;
      PO administration. Interim analyses will be done at Day 14 following the IV dosing groups in&#xD;
      order to assess half-lives of the three compounds to ensure the wash-out period between IV&#xD;
      and PO dosing is at least six half-lives long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetic parameters of the 3 compounds will be calculated from the plasma-time data&#xD;
      using Phoenix WinNonlin version 6.3 or higher, and descriptive statistics assessed using SAS&#xD;
      version 9.3 or higher. No statistical significance inferences will be made. An analysis of&#xD;
      variance (ANOVA) will be performed on the natural logarithm (ln) transformed dose-adjusted&#xD;
      AUCinf to estimate the bioavailability. The sample size of 6 subjects per group is considered&#xD;
      adequate to obtain useful data to compute descriptive statistics. Interim analyses will be&#xD;
      done after the IV dosing groups in order to assess half-lives of the 3 compounds to ensure&#xD;
      the wash-out period between IV bolus and oral dosing is at least 6 half-lives long.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participation in another clinical trial in which a 14C-labeled drug was administered&#xD;
             within 1 year prior to Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other significant finding that in the opinion of the clinical investigators would&#xD;
