    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is highly prevalent in women resulting in 398,086 deaths&#xD;
      annually. Even as women participate in traditional CR programs, data specificity and&#xD;
      subsequent research have yet to emerge in a meaningful way so that women-centered CR can be&#xD;
      better customized and their outcomes properly assessed. Aerobic fitness is a powerful&#xD;
      predictor of prognosis in individuals with CVD yet there is evidence that women do not&#xD;
      improve their peak VO2 as much as men during CR. We have designed a training program for&#xD;
      women based upon past research with a goal of optimizing their training potential in CR. This&#xD;
      program combines the utilization of a training technique termed high intensity interval&#xD;
      training along with specific strength training exercises of the upper legs. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that women, irrespective of age, would be capable of high intensity interval training to&#xD;
      improve peak aerobic capacity in the CR setting. Furthermore, since women often have a&#xD;
      deficit of thigh strength entering CR, and thigh strength correlates with endurance&#xD;
      walking,strength training will also be included. The purpose of this study is to examine the&#xD;
      value of high intensity interval training and strength training to maximize aerobic training&#xD;
      response in CR for women. This may contribute to establishing specific protocols and training&#xD;
      guidelines for future program design for women in CR. Since a set of comprehensive CR&#xD;
      guidelines pertaining to women is lacking, it is hoped that the results of this study will&#xD;
      help us develop exercise protocols and regimen to better structure and modulate CR programs&#xD;
      for optimal benefit to women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the foremost leading cause of death in women.1 More than 1 in&#xD;
      3 female adults are affected by CVD.2 Though the prevalence of CVD in women remains high,&#xD;
      there is a relative paucity of research pertaining to women in Cardiac Rehabilitation (CR).&#xD;
      Improvements in peak VO2 in CR are prognostically important 3-5 and several studies have&#xD;
      shown that women increase their aerobic capacity in CR to a lesser degree than men.6,7 Even&#xD;
      as women participate in many traditional CR programs, data specificity and subsequent&#xD;
      research has yet to emerge in a meaningful way so that women-centered CR can be better&#xD;
      customized and their outcomes properly assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is understood that women demonstrate a lower VO2 max than that of men8 on entry into CR&#xD;
      which is often attributed to their smaller muscle mass, lower hemoglobin and blood volume,&#xD;
      and smaller stroke volume relative to men.9 A finding of our previous study on aerobic&#xD;
      capacity in patients entering cardiac rehabilitation revealed that values of peak VO2 on&#xD;
      entry to CR were extremely low, particularly in women.6 It has been observed in the CR&#xD;
      setting that women have lower physical function scores than men.10 Handgrip strength also&#xD;
      differs between men and women.11 Baseline maximal exercise capacity of peak VO2 has been&#xD;
      found to be the best predictors of baseline physical function score along with strength&#xD;
      measures of leg press and bench press.10 Another study of ours revealed that while a peak VO2&#xD;
      below 15 was associated with high risk of annual all-cause mortality among men, a peak VO2&#xD;
      below 12 was associated with highest risk among women.12 Though women in another study had&#xD;
      lower peak exercise capacities than men, they achieved similar relative improvements as a&#xD;
      result of cardiac rehabilitation.13 Research in the field deserves further exploration as the&#xD;
      results remain mixed. As women improve less than men in attaining peak VO2, we have put&#xD;
      together a training program for women with a goal of optimizing their training potential in&#xD;
      CR. This program combines the utilization of a training technique termed interval training&#xD;
      along with specific strength training exercises of the legs. Previous studies that included&#xD;
      both men and women with CAD have indicated that high intensity interval training might be&#xD;
      more beneficial than moderate or standard intensity training in terms of improvements in&#xD;
      aerobic fitness.14-16 However, the specificity of benefits for women remains rather elusive.&#xD;
      Thus, studying variations in strength and power with appropriate interval training could help&#xD;
      us attain better outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that women, irrespective of age, would be capable of high intensity interval&#xD;
      training to improve peak aerobic capacity in the CR setting. Furthermore, since women often&#xD;
      have a deficit of thigh strength entering CR, strength training will also be included. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to examine the value of high intensity interval training and&#xD;
      strength training to maximize aerobic fitness in Cardiac Rehabilitation for women. This may&#xD;
      contribute to establishing specific protocols and training guidelines for future program&#xD;
      design for women in CR. Since a set of comprehensive CR guidelines pertaining to women is&#xD;
      lacking, it is hoped that the results of this study will help us develop exercise protocols&#xD;
      and regimen to better structure and modulate CR programs for optimal benefit to women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Describe the research design, including a description of any new methodology&#xD;
      and its advantage over existing methodologies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study to be conducted at University of Vermont Cardiac Rehabilitation&#xD;
      Center involving female cardiac patients. At entry to CR, data to be collected from patients&#xD;
      participating in the study include: 1) Baseline characteristics such as age, body weight and&#xD;
      height for calculation of BMI, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (rest), heart rate&#xD;
      (rest, peak), medications, prior cardiac event etc., 2) Aerobic fitness assessment using a&#xD;
      symptom-limited graded exercise tolerance test on treadmill to determine Peak metabolic&#xD;
      equivalents (METs peak) and Peak VO2, 3) Strength measurement assessment using a&#xD;
      single-repetition maximal lift (bench press for upper body and leg extension for lower body)&#xD;
      and a handgrip dynamometer for handgrip strength, 4) Perceived exertion rate after each&#xD;
      training session using BORG 6-20 scale18, 5) Self-reported physical functioning assessment&#xD;
      using the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (MOS SF-36) survey questionnaire (0-100 scale)&#xD;
      with 100 representing excellent physical functioning, 6) a co-morbidity score to determine&#xD;
      the presence of peripheral vascular disease, cerebrovascular disease, chronic lung disease,&#xD;
      or orthopedic limitations. If a co-morbid condition is present, it is quantified by severity&#xD;
      as follows: 1, present but not exercising-limiting; 2, present and impacts on exercise&#xD;
      performance; and 3, exercising-limiting; a total co-morbidity score ranging from 0 to 12 is&#xD;
      to be determined for each participant, and 7) any &quot;quality of life improvements&quot; for&#xD;
      participants as measured by the MacNew Heart Disease Health-Related Quality of Life&#xD;
      Questionnaire.19 All of these measures with the exception of the MacNew questionnaire are&#xD;
      collected on all CR entrants in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard exercise training protocol will comprise of 3-one hour long sessions per week&#xD;
      spanning 12 weeks, consisting of aerobic exercise and resistance training. Each session&#xD;
      includes treadmill walking, rowing, cycling and aerobic exercise in the control group will be&#xD;
      performed at an intensity of 70-85% of peak HR (moderate intensity) for a total of 45 minutes&#xD;
      with rest periods as needed between equipment Patients will also participate in resistance&#xD;
      training which will include 1 set of 10 repetitions at an intensity of 60-65% of the single&#xD;
      repetition maximal lift (1-RM) of the following: leg extension, leg curl, bench press,&#xD;
      shoulder press, lateral pull down, and bicep curl. For those who underwent CABG, upper body&#xD;
      resistance training will take place 3 months post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The high intensity interval training with more intensive strength training will consist of&#xD;
      3-one hour sessions over the course of 12 weeks. For this group, all aerobic training will&#xD;
      comprise of &quot;high intensity interval treadmill walking&quot; (HIT). Patients will warm up for 5&#xD;
      minutes at 60-70% of peak HR followed by 4 minute intervals to achieve 90-95% of peak HR. In&#xD;
      between each interval will be a 4 minute walking period at 50-60% of peak HR. You will also&#xD;
      perform other types of exercise such as cycling and rowing for up to a total of 45 minutes of&#xD;
      aerobic exercise. You can rest, as needed, in between different types of exercise equipment.&#xD;
      Additionally, this group will undergo strength training as described above, however, they&#xD;
      will do 2 sets of 10 repetitions for upper leg exercises at an intensity of 80% 1-RM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At entry to CR, the study participants will be asked to fill out the following&#xD;
      questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical Outcomes Study Short Form-36 (MOS SF-36) survey questionnaire to report the&#xD;
           physical functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MacNew Heart Disease Health-Related Quality of Life Questionnaire to measure quality of&#xD;
           life improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the study after 12 weeks, the participants will be asked to do the same&#xD;
      measures. Random IDs will be given to patients filling out the survey instruments to maintain&#xD;
      privacy and confidentiality. Additionally, the results will be stored on a password-protected&#xD;
      secure computer network of UVMMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations undertaken by us (80% power with 5% level of significance) based on&#xD;
      Wisloff study15 suggested that a sample size of 19 per group is needed to detect a difference&#xD;
      of 30% between groups in Peak VO2 by exercise training regimen. We intend to conduct an&#xD;
      interim updated power analysis once we have 10 patients to better fine tune the power&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics will be presented as mean SD. Non- paired t-tests will be used for&#xD;
      comparison between groups at baseline (pre-test), at the conclusion of the study (post-test),&#xD;
      and percent changes after exercise regimen. ANOVA for repeated measures will be used for&#xD;
      analyzing the effect of the exercise regimen between groups. A level of significance of&#xD;
      P&lt;0.05 will be used to indicate statistical significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible participants in the study will perform the CR exercise training under the&#xD;
      supervision of exercised physiologists. This study presents minimal risk to participants as&#xD;
      indeed, CR participation yields a 25% decrease in overall mortality and a 31% decrease in&#xD;
      hospitalizations in year 1.20&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits of CR include improved overall cardiovascular health, knowledge of physical&#xD;
      functioning opportunities and limitations, and ability to both undertake and continue&#xD;
      exercise for a longer span of time beyond the end of the study. An underlying assumption of&#xD;
      the study is optimization of exercise might yield a greater training increase in Peak VO2 in&#xD;
      the HIT group along with possible greater improvements in fitness and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will obtain all of the standard benefits of CR which include a lower mortality&#xD;
      rate, a lower re-hospitalization rate, and an improved quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety and Monitoring:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hard copy of paper data will be stored in locked office and file cabinets. All electronic&#xD;
      data will be password protected and stored on the UVMMC secured network server.&#xD;
