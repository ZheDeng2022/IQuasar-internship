  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well epacadostat and pembrolizumab work in treating&#xD;
      participants with pancreatic cancer that has spread to other places in the body. Epacadostat&#xD;
      may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving epacadostat and pembrolizumab may work better in treating participants with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the efficacy of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab as determined&#xD;
      by the best overall response rate in previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma with homologous recombination repair deficiency (HRD) aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To further determine the efficacy of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma with HRD aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      previously treated patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma with HRD aberrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify predictive, mechanistic, and/or surrogate biomarkers of clinical efficacy of&#xD;
      epacadostat in combination with pembrolizumab in previously treated patients with advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma with HRD aberrations utilizing exploratory studies investigating&#xD;
      the patients tumor and immune system response including: flow cytometry of fresh peripheral&#xD;
      blood mononuclear cell (PBMC), PDL-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1 and&#xD;
      epacadostat orally (PO) twice daily (BID) on days 1-21. Cycles repeat every 21 days in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unaccepted toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, participants are followed up at 30 days, every 8 weeks&#xD;
      for 3 years, and then every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
