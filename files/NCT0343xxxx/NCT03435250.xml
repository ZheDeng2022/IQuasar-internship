  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and clinical&#xD;
      activity of AG-270 in participants with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma with homozygous&#xD;
      MTAP deletion.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Phase 1, multicenter, open-label study is to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD) of AG-270, administered as a single agent or in combination with&#xD;
      taxane-based chemotherapy, and to characterize its dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) when given&#xD;
      daily by mouth to participants with advanced solid tumors or lymphoma with homozygous&#xD;
      deletion of methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (MTAP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each arm of the study, successive cohorts of participants will receive increasing oral&#xD;
      doses of AG-270 to determine the MTD, the dose with maximum pharmacologic activity or the&#xD;
      maximum feasible dose, as a single agent and in combination with taxane-based chemotherapy.&#xD;
      In the subsequent dose-expansion parts of the study, additional participants in each&#xD;
      treatment arm will be treated at the MTD (or one of the described alternative doses) to&#xD;
      further characterize that dose's safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD), and to detect preliminary evidence of anti-tumor activity.&#xD;

             prior lines of cytotoxic chemotherapy in the setting of metastatic disease; For both&#xD;
             participants with NSCLC and participants with other malignancies prior treatment with&#xD;
             taxanes is permitted, but prior treatment with docetaxel is not allowed. There is no&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Qualified scientific and medical researchers can request access to anonymized patient-level and study-level clinical trial data.&#xD;
Access can be requested for all interventional clinical studies:&#xD;
used for Marketing Authorization (MA) of medicines and new indications approved after 1 January 2014 in the European Economic Area (EEA) or the United States (US).&#xD;
where Servier is the Marketing Authorization Holder (MAH). The date of the first MA of the new medicine (or the new indication) in one of the EEA Member States will be considered for this scope.&#xD;
In addition, access can be requested for all interventional clinical studies in patients:&#xD;
sponsored by Servier&#xD;
with a first patient enrolled as of 1 January 2004 onwards&#xD;
for New Chemical Entity or New Biological Entity (new pharmaceutical form excluded) for which development has been terminated before any Marketing authorization (MA) approval.</ipd_description>
