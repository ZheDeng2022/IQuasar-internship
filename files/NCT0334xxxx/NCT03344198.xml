  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will explore the capacity for a lifestyle modification in firefighters to improve&#xD;
      blood pressure, blood vessel stiffness, inflammation, and reduce oxidative stress. The study&#xD;
      will be a pre- post-testing controlled trial with three groups. The intervention will be a&#xD;
      weekly circuit workout program and a Mediterranean (high fruit/vegetable) diet. The groups&#xD;
      will be firefighters with &gt;10yrs experience, firefighters with &lt;10yrs experience, and control&#xD;
      Non-firefighters.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent statistics from the American Heart Association (AHA) have reported that &gt;92% of adults&#xD;
      in the U.S. meet at least 1 metric for cardiovascular disease risk factors. In firefighters,&#xD;
      this increased risk is especially concerning. The National Fire Protection Agency (NFPA)&#xD;
      estimates there are around 1.3 million firefighters in the United States, 70% of which are&#xD;
      volunteer. The prevalence of impaired cardiovascular health is higher in firefighters than in&#xD;
      the general population and the leading line-of-duty death (LODD) cause is cardiac related. It&#xD;
      is known that exercise and diet mitigate cardiovascular disease risk. Meeting the physical&#xD;
      activity guidelines remains a target of ideal cardiovascular health and a major public health&#xD;
      concern. However, the NFPA does not require volunteer fire companies to have a fitness&#xD;
      program for their crew, and sadly less than a third of the stations actually do. And&#xD;
      importantly, cardiovascular-related LODD remains a major issue in the firefighter population.&#xD;
      The results could guide clinical treatment for firefighters and may therefore reduce&#xD;
      cardiac-related LODD.&#xD;
