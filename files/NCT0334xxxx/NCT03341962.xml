    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-finding&#xD;
      study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of IMU-838 for induction and maintenance therapy&#xD;
      with an option for open-label treatment extension in moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (CALDOSE-1).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigational medicinal product (IMP) IMU-838 (vidofludimus calcium) is a new compound&#xD;
      that selectively inhibits the human enzyme dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (DHODH).&#xD;
      Dihydroorotate dehydrogenase plays a major role in the de-novo pyrimidine synthesis and is&#xD;
      specifically expressed at high levels in proliferating or activated lymphocytes. Resting&#xD;
      lymphocytes satisfy their pyrimidine requirements through a DHODH-independent salvage&#xD;
      pathway. Thus, IMU-838-mediated DHODH inhibition selectively affects activated, rapidly&#xD;
      proliferating lymphocytes. The metabolic stress secondary to DHODH inhibition leads to a&#xD;
      reduction of pro-inflammatory cytokine release including interleukin (IL)-17 (IL-17A and&#xD;
      IL-17F) and interferon gamma (IFNγ), and to an increased apoptosis in activated lymphocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase 2, multicenter, randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled trial in&#xD;
      patients with moderate-to-severe UC with an option for open-label treatment extension. The&#xD;
      study comprises a blinded induction phase to establish the optimal dose of IMU-838 to induce&#xD;
      response and remission, a blinded maintenance phase to evaluate the potential of IMU-838 to&#xD;
      maintain remission until Week 50, and an open-label treatment extension arm for all patients&#xD;
      who discontinue the blinded phase as scheduled or prematurely, subject to certain&#xD;
      restrictions. A subset of patients will undergo a pharmacokinetic (PK) period at the start of&#xD;
      the open-label period to establish a full single-dose PK profile.&#xD;
