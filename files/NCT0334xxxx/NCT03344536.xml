  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of a phase Ib study is to find out the best or maximum tolerated dose of a&#xD;
      medication or combination of medications. Therefore, the purpose of this study is to decide&#xD;
      the best dose of the study drug, Debio 1347, that can be given in combination with the&#xD;
      standard hormonal drug, fulvestrant. Debio 1347 and fulvestrant could shrink the cancer but&#xD;
      it could also cause side effects. This study tells us about the side effects of these drugs&#xD;
      when given in this new combination, and how often they occur.&#xD;
