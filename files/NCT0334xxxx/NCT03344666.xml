  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will use a SMART (Sequential, Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) design to&#xD;
      optimize adaptive interventions (AIs) for adolescents reporting alcohol misuse and violent&#xD;
      behaviors. The study will test the efficacy of state-of-the-art adaptive intervention&#xD;
      delivery approaches (text messaging, remote therapy) for reducing alcohol use and violent&#xD;
      behaviors among urban teens. Given the morbidly/mortality associated with alcohol use and&#xD;
      violence, this study will have significant impact by using a SMART design to identify the&#xD;
      optimal intervention strategy to produce and sustain outcomes among at-risk youth.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims are to: 1) Compare the efficacy of adaptive interventions (AIs) that begin&#xD;
      with BI+TM (brief intervention + text messaging) vs. BI+HC (brief intervention + remote&#xD;
      health coach) on reducing alcohol misuse and violent behaviors among youth while in the&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED); and, 2) Identify the most efficacious second-stage strategy&#xD;
      post-ED visit for those who initially respond and for those who do not. Specifically, 700&#xD;
      youth (ages 14-20) in the ED screening positive for alcohol use and violent behaviors will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to: BI+TM or BI+HC. After receiving the SafERteens BI in the ED, youth will&#xD;
      complete weekly assessments over an 8 week period to tailor intervention content and measure&#xD;
      mechanisms of change, with one month determination of participant response (e.g., binge&#xD;
      drinking, violence). Responders in each arm will be re-randomized to continued condition&#xD;
      (e.g., stay the course or maintenance), or reduced condition (e.g., stepped down).&#xD;
      Non-responders will be re-randomized to continued condition (e.g., stay the course or&#xD;
      maintenance), or intensified condition (e.g., stepped up). Follow-up assessments will take&#xD;
      place at 4 and 8 months post-baseline.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 months and 8 months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol consumption will be assessed using the 30-day Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB). The TLFB will capture information on the frequency and quantity of alcohol use including binge drinking, with total consumption calculated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Physical Violence</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months and 8 months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Physical violence will be assessed using the 30-day Timeline Follow-Back (TLFB). The TLFB will capture information on the frequency and severity of violent behaviors (e.g. push, shove, slap, kick, punch, weapon/firearm use or carriage etc.), with total violence calculated weighted by severity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Alcohol Consequences</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months and 8 months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Alcohol related consequences will be measured using the Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (YAACQ). This study will use a 24-item scale with the following responses (and values):&#xD;
0 = None&#xD;
= 1-2 times&#xD;
= 3-5 times&#xD;
= More than 5 times&#xD;
The responses will be summed for a total score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Violence Consequences</measure>
    <time_frame>4 months and 8 months post baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Violence related consequences will be assessed using 13 items with following responses (and values):&#xD;
0 = None&#xD;
= 1-2 times&#xD;
= 3-5 times&#xD;
= More than 5 times&#xD;
These items will assess consequences such as injury, arrest, trouble at school or work, arguments or trouble getting along with friends and/or family members, feeling guilty, unable to stop/desire to fight, and worry or revenge as a result of participant's fighting. Responses are summed to create a total score.</description>

    <description>Participants will be randomized to first treatment to compare Brief Intervention + Health Coach (Step 1 Treatment BI+HC) to Brief Intervention + Text Messages (Step 1 Treatment BI+TM). Participants in the BI+HC will receive a BI in the ED, followed by weekly sessions with the Health Coach for 4 weeks. Participants in the BI+TM will receive a BI in the ED, followed by daily TMs for 4 weeks.</description>

    <description>Beginning in week 5, all participants will be classified as Responders or Non-Responders (based on weekly assessments) and re-randomized.&#xD;
Step 2 Treatment Responders: Responders will be randomized to either stay the course or be stepped down. Specifically, participants in the BI+HC will either continue to receive the HC or stepped down to receive a control brochure; participants in the BI+TM will either continue to receive the TM or stepped down to receive a control brochure.&#xD;
Step 2 Treatment Non-Responders: Non-Responders will be randomized to either stay the course or be stepped up. Specifically, participants in the BI+HC will either continue to receive the HC or stepped up to receive a HC+; participants in the BI+TM will either continue to receive the TM or stepped up to receive HC.</description>
