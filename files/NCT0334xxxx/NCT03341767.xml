  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of treating&#xD;
      Cryptosporidiosis in HIV positive patients with Clofazimine. Half of the HIV positive&#xD;
      patients with Cryptosporidiosis enrolled will be treated with Clofazimine while the other&#xD;
      half will be given placebo. An additional group of HIV positive patients without&#xD;
      Cryptosporidium infection or diarrhea will be given Clofazimine to assess the differences in&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics between HIV positive patients with and without Cryptosporidiosis and&#xD;
      diarrhea.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cryptosporidiosium infection and diarrhea is a life-threatening infection in children 6-18&#xD;
      months and in immunocompromised patients. However, Nitazoxanide, the only drug approved for&#xD;
      treatment of Cryptosporidiosis, showed little-to-no efficacy in HIV positive patients and low&#xD;
      efficacy in malnourished children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, Love MS et al reported that Clofazimine inhibited proliferation of both&#xD;
      Cryptosporidium parvum and C. hominis in vitro and reduced shedding in a mouse model of acute&#xD;
      C. parvum infection. Clofazimine has been approved for treatment of leprosy for decades and&#xD;
      more recently for the treatment of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of Clofazimine are well documented for a variety of patient populations, but&#xD;
      not for HIV positive patients or patients with diarrhea. Thus, this clinical trial seeks to&#xD;
      determine the efficacy of 50 or 100 mg of Clofazimine administered 3 times daily for 5 days&#xD;
      on fecal shedding of Cryptosporidium oocysts in HIV positive patients, as well as safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetics in this patient population.&#xD;
