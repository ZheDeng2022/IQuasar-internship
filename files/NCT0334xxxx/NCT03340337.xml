  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle strength is the amount of force generated by muscle contraction. It could be measured&#xD;
      with an isometric dynamometer. This is a validated tool that could be used to measure Maximal&#xD;
      Voluntary Isometric Contraction (MVIC) and Maximal Electrical Induced Contraction (MEIC). It&#xD;
      is claimed that higher MEIC values will result in more force gained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a current is more tolerated it will be easier to achieve better MEIC values. Tolerance to&#xD;
      an electrical stimulation could be measured with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A ratio&#xD;
      between Normalized MEIC / VAS is often used, implying that the current is better with a&#xD;
      higher ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle fatigue is defined as a temporary loss or decrease in force-generating ability due to&#xD;
      previous contractions. It is claimed that medium frequency neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (NMES) generates more fatigue than low frequency currents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aussie is a medium-frequency alternating current, sinusoidal waveform, 1 KHz carrier&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neo-Russian is a medium-frequency current, rectangular biphasic symmetrical waveform, 2,5 KHz&#xD;
      carrier frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rectangular Biphasic symmetrical (RBS) waveform is a type of Low Pulsed Current (LPC),&#xD;
      claimed to be better than classical Russian Current.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it has been claimed that LPC is better in MEIC and tolerance, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare it with two newer medium frequency currents in terms of MEIC, tolerance and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty male subjects, right leg dominant, will receive randomly the 3 types of electrical&#xD;
      stimulation. Before that, the MVIC will be measured for data normalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MVIC and MEIC will be measured with an isometric dynamometer. In both measurements,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to perform three reps (5 sec work x 120 sec rest) and the best one&#xD;
      will be used. Whenever the third one was the best, additional measurements will be taken&#xD;
      until a decrease in torque will be obtained to determine the maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To apply Aussie electrical stimulation, an Aussie Sport (Ibramed) will be used. To apply&#xD;
      Neo-Russian, a Neurodyn III (Ibramed) will be used. To apply RBS, a Genesy (Globus) will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS will be used to assess tolerance to each treatment. One week later, the subjects will&#xD;
      receive, randomly, a fatigue protocol that consists in 21 reps (5 sec work x 5 sec rest) of&#xD;
      electrical stimulation with the three types of current. The data will be normalized with the&#xD;
      MVIC and the reps equal or below 50 % of the first rep will be considered as a fatigue rep.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Thirty male subjects, right leg dominant, will receive 3 types of electrical stimulation in a randomized order. Aussie current will be delivered by Aussie Sport (Ibramed) device, Neo-Russian by Neurodyn III (Ibramed) device and RBS by a Genesy (Globus) device.&#xD;
MVIC and MEIC will be measured with an isometric dynamometer (3 reps x 5 sec work x 120 sec rest). The best rep will be used. Whenever the third one was the best, additional measurements will be taken until a decrease in torque will be obtained to determine the maximum. MVIC will be used for data normalization.&#xD;
The VAS will be used to assess tolerance to each treatment. A ratio between MEIC and VAS will be calculated.&#xD;
One week later, subjects will receive, ramdomly, a fatigue protocol with the three types of electrical stimulation that consists in 21 reps (5 sec work x 5 sec rest). The data will be normalized with the MVIC and the reps equal or below 50 % of the first rep will be considered as a fatigue rep.</intervention_model_description>

The best of the 3 repetitions was considered. Whenever the third one was the best, additional measurements were taken until a decrease in torque was obtained in order to determine the maximum.&#xD;
Unit: Newtons (N)</description>
        <time_frame>MVIC was measured at the beggining of the research, on Day 1. Assessed in an average of 7 min</time_frame>
        <population>All the participants received 3 types of electrical stimulation (Neo-Russian, Aussie and RBS), in a randomized order, to determine MEIC and Fatigue.

            <description>As the MVIC was used to normalize the data for others outcome measures, all study participants were included into one arm.&#xD;
A short 10-minute walk was taken to warm-up. The patient was positioned in a therapeutic chair with the hip at 110°, stabilizing the trunk (at chest level) and the hip (at the level of the anterior superior iliac spines) with straps. Knee was placed in 90° flexion. A goniometer was used to correctly position the joints at said angles.&#xD;
The patient was instructed to cross his arms over his chest and relax. The subject was blindfolded to prevent him from watching the procedure.&#xD;
The measuring system was attached to the distal end of the right lower limb by means of an ankle brace.&#xD;
The subject was instructed to perform a maximum voluntary isometric contraction.&#xD;
Dosing information:&#xD;
Knee angle: 90°&#xD;
Hip angle: 110°&#xD;
Work time: 3 sec&#xD;
Rest time: 120 sec&#xD;

          <title>Neo-Russian Electrical Stimulation</title>
          <description>MVIC was measured for data normalization.&#xD;
Subjects received Neo-Russian electrical stimulation with three reps (5 sec work x 120 sec rest), and the Maximal Electrical Induced Contraction (MEIC) was measured.&#xD;
They were asked how uncomfortable the stimulation was, using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
One week later, subjects received a fatigue protocol that consists in 21 reps (5 sec work x 5 sec rest), and the Maximal Electrical Induced Contraction (MEIC) was measured for each contraction.</description>
