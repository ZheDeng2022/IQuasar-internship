  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscle strength is the amount of force generated by muscle contraction. It could be measured&#xD;
      with an isometric dynamometer. This is a validated tool that could be used to measure Maximal&#xD;
      Voluntary Isometric Contraction (MVIC) and Maximal Electrical Induced Contraction (MEIC). It&#xD;
      is claimed that higher MEIC values will result in more force gained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a current is more tolerated it will be easier to achieve better MEIC values. Tolerance to&#xD;
      an electrical stimulation could be measured with the Visual Analogue Scale (VAS). A ratio&#xD;
      between Normalized MEIC / VAS is often used, implying that the current is better with a&#xD;
      higher ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle fatigue is defined as a temporary loss or decrease in force-generating ability due to&#xD;
      previous contractions. It is claimed that medium frequency neuromuscular electrical&#xD;
      stimulation (NMES) generates more fatigue than low frequency currents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aussie is a medium-frequency alternating current, sinusoidal waveform, 1 KHz carrier&#xD;
      frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neo-Russian is a medium-frequency current, rectangular biphasic symmetrical waveform, 2,5 KHz&#xD;
      carrier frequency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rectangular Biphasic symmetrical (RBS) waveform is a type of Low Pulsed Current (LPC),&#xD;
      claimed to be better than classical Russian Current.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As it has been claimed that LPC is better in MEIC and tolerance, the aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare it with two newer medium frequency currents in terms of MEIC, tolerance and fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty male subjects, right leg dominant, will receive randomly the 3 types of electrical&#xD;
      stimulation. Before that, the MVIC will be measured for data normalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MVIC and MEIC will be measured with an isometric dynamometer. In both measurements,&#xD;
      subjects will be asked to perform three reps (5 sec work x 120 sec rest) and the best one&#xD;
      will be used. Whenever the third one was the best, additional measurements will be taken&#xD;
      until a decrease in torque will be obtained to determine the maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To apply Aussie electrical stimulation, an Aussie Sport (Ibramed) will be used. To apply&#xD;
      Neo-Russian, a Neurodyn III (Ibramed) will be used. To apply RBS, a Genesy (Globus) will be&#xD;
      used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The VAS will be used to assess tolerance to each treatment. One week later, the subjects will&#xD;
      receive, randomly, a fatigue protocol that consists in 21 reps (5 sec work x 5 sec rest) of&#xD;
      electrical stimulation with the three types of current. The data will be normalized with the&#xD;
      MVIC and the reps equal or below 50 % of the first rep will be considered as a fatigue rep.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Thirty male subjects, right leg dominant, will receive 3 types of electrical stimulation in a randomized order. Aussie current will be delivered by Aussie Sport (Ibramed) device, Neo-Russian by Neurodyn III (Ibramed) device and RBS by a Genesy (Globus) device.&#xD;
MVIC and MEIC will be measured with an isometric dynamometer (3 reps x 5 sec work x 120 sec rest). The best rep will be used. Whenever the third one was the best, additional measurements will be taken until a decrease in torque will be obtained to determine the maximum. MVIC will be used for data normalization.&#xD;
The VAS will be used to assess tolerance to each treatment. A ratio between MEIC and VAS will be calculated.&#xD;
One week later, subjects will receive, ramdomly, a fatigue protocol with the three types of electrical stimulation that consists in 21 reps (5 sec work x 5 sec rest). The data will be normalized with the MVIC and the reps equal or below 50 % of the first rep will be considered as a fatigue rep.</intervention_model_description>

The best of the 3 repetitions was considered. Whenever the third one was the best, additional measurements were taken until a decrease in torque was obtained in order to determine the maximum.&#xD;
Unit: Newtons (N)</description>
        <time_frame>MVIC was measured at the beggining of the research, on Day 1. Assessed in an average of 7 min</time_frame>
        <population>All the participants received 3 types of electrical stimulation (Neo-Russian, Aussie and RBS), in a randomized order, to determine MEIC and Fatigue.

            <description>As the MVIC was used to normalize the data for others outcome measures, all study participants were included into one arm.&#xD;
A short 10-minute walk was taken to warm-up. The patient was positioned in a therapeutic chair with the hip at 110掳, stabilizing the trunk (at chest level) and the hip (at the level of the anterior superior iliac spines) with straps. Knee was placed in 90掳 flexion. A goniometer was used to correctly position the joints at said angles.&#xD;
The patient was instructed to cross his arms over his chest and relax. The subject was blindfolded to prevent him from watching the procedure.&#xD;
The measuring system was attached to the distal end of the right lower limb by means of an ankle brace.&#xD;
The subject was instructed to perform a maximum voluntary isometric contraction.&#xD;
Dosing information:&#xD;

Work time: 3 sec&#xD;
Rest time: 120 sec&#xD;

          <title>Neo-Russian Electrical Stimulation</title>
          <description>MVIC was measured for data normalization.&#xD;
Subjects received Neo-Russian electrical stimulation with three reps (5 sec work x 120 sec rest), and the Maximal Electrical Induced Contraction (MEIC) was measured.&#xD;
They were asked how uncomfortable the stimulation was, using Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
One week later, subjects received a fatigue protocol that consists in 21 reps (5 sec work x 5 sec rest), and the Maximal Electrical Induced Contraction (MEIC) was measured for each contraction.</description>
