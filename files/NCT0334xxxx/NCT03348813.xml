    <textblock>
      Despite advances in HIV/sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevention, Black youth account&#xD;
      for the largest number of new HIV infections among heterosexual youth. Having a mental&#xD;
      illness contributes to HIV/STI risk among heterosexually active Black youth, as some use sex&#xD;
      as a means to manage psychological distress, regulate emotions and receive validation or&#xD;
      acceptance. Current intervention models focus on cognitive-behavioral strategies to reduce&#xD;
      risk among adolescents; however, these approaches in isolation do not address the&#xD;
      psychopathology that further potentiates risk behaviors among adolescents with mental&#xD;
      illnesses. This randomized controlled trial evaluated the effects of &quot;Project GOLD&quot;, a&#xD;
      theoretically-driven, gender and culturally relevant, developmentally and psychologically&#xD;
      appropriate HIV/STI risk reduction intervention on the sexual behaviors of Black male and&#xD;
      female adolescents in Philadelphia (aged 14-17). In addition to evidence-based HIV/STI&#xD;
      preventions strategies (e.g., role playing), Project GOLD includes unique emotion regulation&#xD;
      content to address the relationship between psychological distress and HIV/STI risk&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team approached and screened 704 adolescents. Eighty-two participated in the&#xD;
      elicitation research activities (e.g., focus groups, intervention dress rehearsal). Another&#xD;
      173 underwent a structured demographic and mental health diagnostic interview to determine&#xD;
      RCT eligibility. Project GOLD was then tested with 108 Black youth in comparison to a general&#xD;
      health promotion control condition (intervention n = 52; control n = 56). Youth who were not&#xD;
      in psychiatric treatment were also included, as the investigators hypothesized that they&#xD;
      would also benefit from the targeted psychoeducational content; post-hoc analyses examined&#xD;
      differences in the intervention effects based on whether or not youth were in psychiatric&#xD;
      treatment. The intervention had high feasibility and acceptability. These findings underscore&#xD;
      the need to encourage HIV/STI testing and risk reduction efforts among Black youth, including&#xD;
      those with mental illnesses.&#xD;

      This project was approved by the University of Pennsylvania, the Philadelphia Department of&#xD;
      Public Health, and the School District of Philadelphia. The primary study site was the&#xD;
      University of Pennsylvania. Recruitment took place at public locations in the city of&#xD;
      Philadelphia (e.g., recreational centers, community events), Community Behavioral Health&#xD;
      (CBH) provider sites, and schools in the School District of Philadelphia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Team-Building and Elicitation Research (Study aim #1; N = 53). Team building and&#xD;
      community engagement were an ongoing process throughout the course of the study. The&#xD;
      investigators initially focused on team-building and strengthening ties with collaborators,&#xD;
      securing buy-in from key community stakeholders and providers, recruiting 8 members for a&#xD;
      youth CAB, and hiring and training project staff. The investigators were committed to the&#xD;
      development of an acceptable, practical intervention which could easily be implemented and&#xD;
      sustained in the targeted community setting. Therefore, continual feedback from Black&#xD;
      adolescents with mental illnesses, CBH providers and research staff was pivotal. Further,&#xD;
      Black adolescents in the target demographic and young adults from the community were hired as&#xD;
      members of the study team in a capacity building approach to create a pipeline for future&#xD;
      HIV/AIDS research investigators and community workers. The investigators also built upon&#xD;
      their existent elicitation research with members of the study population. Four mixed gender&#xD;
      focus groups were conducted with concurrent open-ended questionnaire administration with&#xD;
      Black adolescent males (n= 18) and females (n= 15). The team held meetings with CBH providers&#xD;
      and the youth CAB to determine factors associated with HIV/STI risk related sexual behaviors&#xD;
      in the population, and the role of psychiatric symptoms, the social determinants of health,&#xD;
      gender and culture in sexual risk taking among Black adolescents with mental illnesses. The&#xD;
      baseline intervention questionnaire was also piloted with Black adolescent males (n= 10) and&#xD;
      females (n= 10) for accuracy; revisions were made based on participant suggestions.&#xD;
      Psychometrics of the revised instrument were assessed and results compared to the original&#xD;
      version. The qualitative and quantitative data were examined concurrently to explore&#xD;
      participants' behavioral, normative and control beliefs, as well as contextual factors, as&#xD;
      they relate to HIV/STI risk. Subsequently, this knowledge was used in the design of the&#xD;
      targeted intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Intervention Development and Pre-Pilot Testing (Study aim #2; N = 29). The&#xD;
      investigators used an iterative process to develop the targeted intervention. They sought&#xD;
      feedback from their elicitation participants, youth CAB, and CBH providers at each stage of&#xD;
      intervention development. This input was used to ensure accurate interpretation of the study&#xD;
      findings, as well as to refine the intervention for relevance and sustainability. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of these processes was the development of &quot;Project GOLD&quot;, a theoretically-driven,&#xD;
      gender and culturally relevant, developmentally and psychologically appropriate behavioral&#xD;
      intervention to reduce HIV/STI risk among heterosexually-active Black adolescents receiving&#xD;
      outpatient mental health treatment. The intervention name was created by the youth CAB, along&#xD;
      with the project logo. The intent in this branding was to foster gender and cultural pride&#xD;
      through visually and verbally reinforcing the intervention's tagline: &quot;We are Kings and&#xD;
      Queens who make confident and royal decisions&quot;. The first pre-pilot testing, or dress&#xD;
      rehearsal, of the interventions and all study materials and instruments was conducted with a&#xD;
      sample of Black adolescent males (n= 4) and females (n= 4). Participants completed pre- and&#xD;
      post-intervention assessments, and the team debriefed with them to solicit their feedback on&#xD;
      ways to improve the project. Revisions were made and a new, independent sample of Black&#xD;
      adolescent males (n= 3) and females (n= 4) completed the second pre-intervention pilot. The&#xD;
      investigators completed the same process for the general health intervention (N = 14). The&#xD;
      goals of the intervention pilots were to evaluate whether the interventions were likely to&#xD;
      affect the conceptual variables, to evaluate whether the participants viewed the&#xD;
      interventions as valuable and engaging, and to ensure the study protocols were relevant to&#xD;
      achieve the aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Intervention Pilot (Study aims #3 &amp; 4; N = 108). Based on the Phase 2 findings, the&#xD;
      final versions of the intervention protocols, materials and instruments were developed and&#xD;
      sent for printing. The intervention was piloted with 108 youth; 109 enrolled but one&#xD;
      participant was terminated at the baseline visit for eminent suicide risk. Participants were&#xD;
      randomized to either Project GOLD (n = 52) or the general health promotion control arm (n =&#xD;
      56). There were five RCT visits: baseline, immediate post, and 3-, 6-, and 12-month&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCT Sample, Recruitment and Enrollment. Provider referrals, waiting room encounters, flyers,&#xD;
      social media, and teen-focused community events and locations (e.g., talent showcases and&#xD;
      game nights; recreational centers) were used to inform potential participants about the&#xD;
      study. As part of the investigators' community engagement mission, the research team hosted&#xD;
      programs and/or partnered with local community-based organizations to promote HIV/STI&#xD;
      awareness and encourage testing among youth. In an effort to increase study enrollment, staff&#xD;
      members also screened interested youth for eligibility at these events. The programs took&#xD;
      place in reserved campus space at the University of Pennsylvania, or a public community space&#xD;
      as approved (e.g., local YMCA or recreation center). Eligibility was determined using a&#xD;
      structured screening script either in person or by telephone. All study visits took place at&#xD;
      one of the sites where participants were recruited, at the University of Pennsylvania in a&#xD;
      private conference room, or in a private conference room at a community-based organization&#xD;
      near where participants are recruited (e.g., recreation center). No data collection occurred&#xD;
      at any School District schools or property as a condition of their IRB approval. For the RCT,&#xD;
      participants registered with the study coordinator, were assessed by a research team member&#xD;
      using an electronic version of the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), provided a urine&#xD;
      specimen, had their mouths swabbed for the rapid HIV test, and completed the&#xD;
      self-administered sexual risk behavior questionnaire in a private, quiet room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assent versus Consent. In the state of Pennsylvania, adolescents between the ages of 14 to 17&#xD;
      can autonomously make decisions about their sexual and mental health assessment and&#xD;
      treatment. &quot;…[I]f a minor is able to consent to medical, dental and health services under&#xD;
      state law, the minor is also able to consent to take part in medical research&quot; (pg. 9).&#xD;
      Therefore, youth aged 14 to 17 provided consent to participate in the research without&#xD;
      parental permission. Initial disagreements among the approving IRBs, however, lead to&#xD;
      substantial protocol delays. The investigators agreed to exclude (or withdraw from&#xD;
      participation) any adolescent whose parent/guardian is aware of/finds out about the study and&#xD;
      indicates that they do not want their son or daughter to participate in the research. This&#xD;
      was honored if a participant shared that his or her parent/guardian expressed to them that&#xD;
      they did not want them in the study, or if the parent/guardian directly contacted a member of&#xD;
      the research team to state they did not want their son or daughter to be involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Consent/Assent &amp; Diagnostic Assessment. Adolescents who were preliminarily&#xD;
      eligible were scheduled for their first study visit to undergo a 30-minute diagnostic&#xD;
      assessment using the MINI to ascertain psychiatric diagnosis and rule out exclusionary&#xD;
      disorders. Trained study personnel conducted all of the diagnostic assessments. Based on the&#xD;
      diagnostic assessment, adolescents were excluded if they: 1) had a psychotic disorder, or&#xD;
      disorder with psychosis, 2) were cognitively impaired, or 3) their current treatment required&#xD;
      hospitalization. Eligible participants immediately participated in a brief, 10-minute&#xD;
      structured demographic interview. The interview was used to obtain locator information to&#xD;
      follow participants over the course of the study, as well as to elicit information regarding&#xD;
      referral source, demographics, and clinical data (i.e. psychiatric and medical history). The&#xD;
      structured diagnostic and demographic interviews took approximately 40 minutes. At the end of&#xD;
      the structured interviews, participants were scheduled for their second study visit which&#xD;
      included the baseline assessment and first intervention session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Enrollment, Randomization &amp; Intervention Trial. At the second study visit,&#xD;
      participants completed the electronic baseline assessments (Intervention Baseline&#xD;
      Questionnaire which includes the Background Information Questionnaire and PHQ-9) and provided&#xD;
      urine specimens for STI testing. When the urine specimens were obtained, all participants&#xD;
      signed a medical release form so that the study's Nurse Practitioner could receive the STI&#xD;
      test results and confirm treatment for positive results with the health centers or chosen&#xD;
      providers. They then immediately attended the first intervention session following these&#xD;
      procedures. Randomization to either the targeted intervention or treatment control group&#xD;
      occurred at the diagnostic visit. Where feasible, intervention and control group sessions ran&#xD;
      concurrently at the same site; if the sessions could not be run on the same day, intervention&#xD;
      and control group sessions were delivered within the same week at each site, or as close as&#xD;
      possible thereafter. Participants attended the second intervention session (their third study&#xD;
      visit) two weeks after the first intervention session. Immediately following the second/final&#xD;
      intervention session they completed post-intervention measures, had their mouths swabbed for&#xD;
      a rapid HIV test, and received their HIV/STI results. In accordance with the CDC's Revised&#xD;
      Recommendations for HIV Testing of Adults, Adolescents, and Pregnant Women in Health Care&#xD;
      Settings, HIV screening was provided for all participants unless a participant expressly&#xD;
      refused to take an HIV test (59.3% consented to HIV testing). Thus, study participants were&#xD;
      offered HIV testing but not required to consent to testing to participate in the study.&#xD;
      Participants also returned for post-intervention follow-up visits 3-, 6-, and 12-months after&#xD;
      the date of their final intervention session. At each study visit, participants registered&#xD;
      with the study coordinator, were screened with the electronic PHQ-9 and had all appropriate&#xD;
      labs collected. They were then seated in a quiet room and provided with the electronic,&#xD;
      self-administered Background Information Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No adolescents tested positive for HIV over the course of the study. Those who tested&#xD;
      positive for another STI were permitted to stay in the study. The study Nurse Practitioner&#xD;
      notified participants of their baseline STI results at the end of the final intervention&#xD;
      session, and participants received subsequent notifications by phone within 2-weeks after&#xD;
      each of the 3 follow-up time points. Individuals who tested positive for an STI were referred&#xD;
      to receive free treatment through the Philadelphia Health Department at the designated STI&#xD;
      control health centers (Health Centers #1 [500 S. Broad St.] and #5 [1900 N. 20th St.]).&#xD;
      Individuals who tested positive for an STI and fail to be located, did not comply with&#xD;
      returning to the study site, or who failed to seek clinical treatment through an alternative&#xD;
      provider, were reported to the City of Philadelphia Department of Public Health, as required&#xD;
      by the City of Philadelphia.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Enrolled participants were randomized to either the targeted intervention group or the attention control group at the diagnostic visit. The permuted-block randomization technique was used with a block size of 4 and a 1:1 allocation ratio. Dr. Alex Hanlon (biostatistics consultant) generated the randomization list using a pseudo-randomizer computer program. The Research Coordinator maintained the spreadsheet for tracking and allocation concealment. To reduce the risk of encountering a floor or ceiling effect with intervention responsiveness, participants were stratified based on their PHQ-9 total scores (none/moderate depression versus moderately severe/severe depression) and gender.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The targeted HIV/STI risk reduction intervention was delivered with groups of up to 8 participants through 8, 45-minute modules equally divided over 2 days (4 modules per session). It was designed to enhance participants' knowledge and ability to reduce their risk of HIV/STIs. Grounded in both social/behavioral and cognitive theories, the intervention includes psychoeducation, and was intended to enhance participants' HIV/STI prevention knowledge, attitudes, beliefs and skills in a manner relevant to Black adolescents.</description>

    <description>The original Promoting Health among Teens (PHAT) Project was designed to increase knowledge and motivation regarding healthful dietary practices, aerobic exercise, and breast and testicular self-examination, and to discourage cigarette smoking. The 8-hour, 2-session PHAT intervention was shortened to mirror the Project GOLD HIV/STI risk reduction curriculum. This was done to control for the Hawthorne effect and reduce the likelihood that effects of the HIV/STI risk reduction intervention can be attributed to its nonspecific features, including special attention. From an ethical standpoint, adolescents in both conditions received a valuable and engaging health-risk-reduction intervention as opposed to &quot;usual care.&quot;</description>
