    <textblock>
      Abnormalities in the regulation of cardiovascular system due to autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      (ANS) dysfunction may lead to a sudden decline in blood pressure (BP) upon standing, sitting&#xD;
      or performing activities/exercises in patients with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This sudden&#xD;
      decline in BP is known as 'orthostatic hypotension' (OH). OH may cause dizziness and/or&#xD;
      black-outs, which may increase the risk of falls. As falls are potentially dangerous and&#xD;
      disabling, it is important to prevent their occurrence. Keeping BP within normal range upon&#xD;
      change of posture or with activities is therefore of great significance. Pooling of blood in&#xD;
      the abdominal blood vessels may be one of the reasons for OH to happen. This research focuses&#xD;
      on strengthening the weak abdominal muscles of the participants so that the compressive&#xD;
      action of these muscles can help decrease such pooling. Therefore, the researchers&#xD;
      hypothesize that strengthening the abdominal muscles shall prove to be helpful in controlling&#xD;
      orthostatic hypotension by preventing a sudden decline in blood pressure of the participants&#xD;
      upon assumption of upright posture. The secondary hypothesis is that there exists a&#xD;
      significant difference in the response of the cardiovascular system to a variety of&#xD;
      postures/activities/exercises when patients of PD having cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction&#xD;
      are compared with patients of PD with normal ANS function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has two parts - stage 1 and stage 2. Only stage 2 is a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. Stage 1 involves testing the functional integrity of the autonomic nervous system, and&#xD;
      observation of the cardiovascular responses of the participants to different&#xD;
      postures/activities/exercises and to the use of an abdominal binder (which is a compressive&#xD;
      garment worn around the abdomen). Findings of stage 1 shall help the researchers better&#xD;
      understand the cardiovascular abnormalities present in such patients at rest and with&#xD;
      activity. Stage 2 involves strength training for the abdominal muscles that is to be done by&#xD;
      the participant at her/his residence for a period of 3 months followed by a second round of&#xD;
      autonomic function testing and observation of the cardiovascular responses to the use of&#xD;
      abdominal binder. Findings of stage 2 shall help the researchers determine if strength&#xD;
      training of the abdominal muscles can be a useful strategy to counter the cardiovascular&#xD;
      abnormalities found in the participants during the testing in stage 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's Disease (PD) is associated with abnormal control of the cardiovascular system in&#xD;
      up to 50% of patients. The cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction is a result of abnormal&#xD;
      regulation of the cardiovascular system by the autonomic nervous system (ANS). It manifests&#xD;
      as orthostatic hypotension, supine hypertension, and may possibly involve abnormal heart rate&#xD;
      and rhythm, as well as abnormal haemodynamic responses to exercise. Orthostatic hypotension&#xD;
      is a sudden decline in the blood pressure (BP) as a result of assumption of more upright&#xD;
      posture like standing up and may present as a generalized weakness, light-headedness, mental&#xD;
      &quot;clouding&quot; up to syncope. Moreover, the stress of exercise may worsen the manifestation of an&#xD;
      asymptomatic cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction, resulting in decreased balance control&#xD;
      which may render the patient unable to exercise and/or predispose the patient to a higher&#xD;
      risk of falls, decreased ability in activities of daily living (ADLs) and confusion. Falls in&#xD;
      elderly patients, which constitute the majority of patients with PD, are potentially&#xD;
      dangerous and disabling. However, the response of the cardiovascular system to neither the&#xD;
      routinely prescribed physiotherapeutic exercises nor the routine physical activities of the&#xD;
      patients of PD are known. Thus, due to lack of any research data on the effects of these&#xD;
      exercises/activities it cannot be determined whether certain components of the routine&#xD;
      physiotherapy treatment are appropriate and safe for the patient with regard to the&#xD;
      development or worsening of cardiovascular autonomic dysfunction. The same is true for some&#xD;
      of the patient's ADLs that may trigger signs and symptoms of cardiovascular autonomic&#xD;
      dysfunction. The researchers, therefore, intend to investigate the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research has two parts - stage 1 and stage 2. Only stage 2 is a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. The specific objectives pertaining to each stage are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1 - To analyze the spectrum of cardiovascular dysfunction in patients with PD -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As determined by the autonomic reflex screening; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In response to the different postures/activities/exercises and to wearing an abdominal&#xD;
           binder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2 - To investigate whether strengthening of the abdominal muscles can be an effective&#xD;
      strategy to improve cardiovascular system's ability to counter the development of OH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon inclusion into the study, baseline autonomic reflex screening shall be undertaken. This&#xD;
      screening has the following components:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantitative Sudomotor Axon Reflex Test (QSART): The QSART evaluates the postganglionic&#xD;
           sympathetic sudomotor axon i.e. it evaluates the response of the sweat cells which are&#xD;
           controlled by the ANS to acetylcholine (ACh). For this, participant's skin is cleaned&#xD;
           and prepared at four sites. Then, ACh is applied at those sites. The movement of ACh&#xD;
           across the skin is facilitated by iontophoresis (using low intensity electrical current&#xD;
           of 2 mA).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Recordings are made for 5 minutes with stimulus application followed by an additional 5&#xD;
           minutes after stimulus termination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For the subsequent 3 tests in the autonomic reflex testing, participants are&#xD;
           instrumented with a beat-to-beat blood pressure device and three-lead electrocardiogram&#xD;
           (ECG).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Heart Rate Response to Deep Breathing (HRDB) with the participant supine: A 1-minute&#xD;
           baseline is recorded. Immediately thereafter, eight consecutive breathing cycles will&#xD;
           take place. Each breathing cycle consists of maximal inspiratory and expiratory phases&#xD;
           of 5 seconds each. Visual feedback is provided to ensure breathing consistency. The&#xD;
           procedure is repeated after a 2-minute rest period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Beat-to-beat BP response to Valsalva Maneuver: The participant, in the supine position&#xD;
           is asked to exhale after a deep inhalation while maintaining a column of mercury at 40&#xD;
           mm for 15 seconds while blowing the air out via a tubing with an air leak. The maneuver&#xD;
           is repeated until two similar beat-to-beat BP and HR are attained. Each maneuver is&#xD;
           separated by 3-minute rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Head-up Tilt: The participant is secured to an automated tilt-table. A 5-minute&#xD;
           recording of HR and BP is obtained while the patient is supine. The table is tilted&#xD;
           slowly to 70 degrees over the course of 10 seconds (it is similar to standing up).&#xD;
           Subjects remain tilted for 5 minutes or until one of the stopping criterion is met.&#xD;
           Manual BP in addition to automated BP may be taken 1 minute before the tilt, at 1, 3,&#xD;
           and 5 minutes during head tilt-up and 1-minute post head tilt-up. All automated&#xD;
           parameters are displayed on a computer console. The specific stopping rules are 1)&#xD;
           patient request, 2) presyncope, and 3) rapid decline in systolic blood pressure in&#xD;
           response to tilt. If any of these are met, the patient will be placed back into supine&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The five primary endpoints of autonomic reflex testing are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. total sweat volume on QSART;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. HR variation on HRDB;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Valsalva ratio during the Valsalva maneuver;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. HR change in response to head-up tilt; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. BP change in response to head-up tilt. The severity and distribution of the autonomic&#xD;
           dysfunction will be quantified using the Composite Autonomic Severity Score (CASS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood flow velocity in the Middle Cerebral Artery (MCA) and frontal/prefrontal cortical&#xD;
      perfusion will be measured using Trans-Cranial Doppler (TCD) and functional Near-Infrared&#xD;
      Spectroscopy (fNIRS). For TCD, a Velcro head band with a flat probe will be placed on the&#xD;
      subject's head before any autonomic test is done and blood flow velocities will be recorded&#xD;
      before any autonomic testing for 5 minutes. After TCD is finalized, fNIRS will be acquired&#xD;
      while the patient performs each maneuver in the rest of the protocol. The participant will be&#xD;
      lying down with the fNIRS probes (two emission and four detection) positioned on the&#xD;
      forehead. The probes are held securely in position by a holder that includes a Velcro strap&#xD;
      wrap around the head. This probe location will provide sensitivity to the prefrontal cortex,&#xD;
      which is known to be activated by information processing tasks. For the following maneuvers&#xD;
      in the rest of the protocol, the fNIRS probes will be placed at the C3 location (i.e., above&#xD;
      the primary motor cortex) according to the international 10-20 system for EEG electrode&#xD;
      placement. fNIRS is a non-invasive optical method that can be used to detect cortical&#xD;
      activity at the bedside. fNIRS systems use the wave length-dependent absorption property of&#xD;
      hemoglobin to monitor changes in the brain concentration of oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin during a&#xD;
      functional task [analogous to functional MRI (fMRI)]. The ratio between oxy- and&#xD;
      deoxyhemoglobin allows estimating cortical perfusion. fNIRS data will complement the TCD&#xD;
      information. TCD provides information regarding MCA flow velocity, allowing us to estimate&#xD;
      pial arteries flow velocities, while fNIRS provides information regarding changes in cortical&#xD;
      perfusion, and thus, intraparenchymal arteries vasoconstriction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this, we shall record a six-month retrospective history of falls. Dizziness Handicap&#xD;
      Inventory (DHI), Autonomic Symptom Profile (ASP), University of California Los Angeles&#xD;
      Dizziness Questionnaire (UCLA-DQ), Orthostatic Hypotension Questionnaire (OHQ) and the&#xD;
      Orthostatic Discriminant and Severity Scale (ODSS) shall be used to assess and quantify the&#xD;
      influence of autonomic dysfunction, orthostatic hypotension and dizziness on participant's&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the above mentioned baseline evaluation of the participant is over, the participant&#xD;
      shall be tested for cardiovascular responses to different postures/activities/exercises and&#xD;
      to the use of an abdominal binder. For this, the participants shall be required to undergo&#xD;
      recording of BP, heart rate (using ECG), analysis of blood flow velocity in the MCA and&#xD;
      frontal/prefrontal cortical perfusion (as described above) while performing any/some of the&#xD;
      following exercises in any sequence or combination:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Deep breathing exercise while in sitting position in a chair or in a standing position,&#xD;
           with or without breath-hold;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sit-to-stand from a chair and return stand-to-sit into the same chair;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Shoulder elevation and/or elbow flexion-extension exercise while holding a 500 ml water&#xD;
           bottle (filled) in each hand (in standing position);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tandem walking (to walk on a straight line where the toes of the back foot touch the&#xD;
           heel of the front foot at each step);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Single leg standing (for each leg);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cross-legged standing;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Supine cycling exercise;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stationary bicycle exercise;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abdominal muscle contraction exercise; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compression of the abdomen using an abdominal binder. An abdominal binder is a fitted&#xD;
           elastic garment that is used for compression of the abdominal wall. It is available in&#xD;
           different sizes. It can be used to support the muscles of the abdominal wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will undergo supine/stationary bicycle exercise for a maximum of 12 minutes&#xD;
      in order to produce sympathetic ANS activation. The stationary bicycle will be adapted based&#xD;
      on the limitations of the individual at a steady workload. Maximum safe workload will be&#xD;
      calculated using Karvonen/Heart Rate Reserve formula, according to the current guidelines.&#xD;
      After a 1-min warm-up period at a 0 Watts workload, an exercise load of 10 Watts/min will be&#xD;
      added and maintained for the full 12 minutes, unless an aspect of the stopping criteria is&#xD;
      met. The specific stopping rules are 1) patient request, 2) rapid decline in systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure, and 3) researcher/staff member's decision to terminate the exercise for&#xD;
      participant's safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants shall be required to complete stage 1. However, only those participants who&#xD;
      have significant autonomic dysfunction shall proceed to stage 2 of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients identified with autonomic dysfunction using the autonomic reflex screening (in stage&#xD;
      1) shall be randomly allocated to either of the two groups. The groups shall be labelled as&#xD;
      group 'Abdominal strengthening exercises' (experimental) and group 'Routine care' (control).&#xD;
      Patients in the experimental group shall in addition to the routine care perform abdominal&#xD;
      strengthening exercises for three months at their home and maintain an exercise log sheet,&#xD;
      whereas, patients in the control group shall continue with the routine care for the next&#xD;
      three months. During the follow-up at three months, patients in both the groups will again&#xD;
      undergo the same testing as mentioned in stage 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abdominal strengthening exercises involve the muscles of the abdomen. Abdominal muscles are&#xD;
      contracted after the participant assumes different postures for a predetermined duration and&#xD;
      for a predetermined number of times in a day. The two groups shall be compared for&#xD;
      effectiveness of abdominal strengthening exercises in preventing orthostatic hypotension upon&#xD;
      autonomic reflex testing after 3 months. Both groups shall additionally be compared while&#xD;
      wearing abdominal binder during a second tilt testing. A three-month history of falls will be&#xD;
      recorded and all participants shall be asked to answer the four questionnaires i.e. DHI, ASP,&#xD;
      OHQ and ODSS again.&#xD;
