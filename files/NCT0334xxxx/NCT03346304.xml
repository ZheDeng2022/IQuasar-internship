      PEARL is a phase III multicentre 2:1 randomised controlled trial, with an incorporated phase&#xD;
      II (pilot) component. All patients consented/registered onto the trial will have an&#xD;
      autofluorescence bronchoscopy (AFB) to check for the presence of high grade lesions (HGLs) in&#xD;
      the lung, as verified by tissue biopsy. Only patients with one or more histologically&#xD;
      confirmed lung HGL will be randomised to receive either photodynamic therapy (PDT) treatment&#xD;
      with surveillance (=intervention), or surveillance alone (=control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the phase II pilot is to demonstrate a &gt;20% response in the PDT group (at&#xD;
      least 3 out of 21 PDT patients), compared to a minimum response of 5%. This will be used as&#xD;
      an efficacy signal to determine whether the trial will continue into phase III. Response will&#xD;
      be measured by regression of high grade lesions (HGLs) to either low grade lesions (LGLs), or&#xD;
      to normal epithelium at 6 months post treatment (blind assessment). The overall aim of the&#xD;
      phase III is to show that the time period over which HGLs progress to invasive lung cancer is&#xD;
      significantly longer when treated with PDT compared to surveillance alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Squamous cell carcinoma of the lung develops through a transition of progressive&#xD;
      cytological aberration, from normal to metaplasia, mild, moderate, and severe dysplasia and&#xD;
      then carcinoma in situ (CIS) before becoming an invasive cancer. Progression rates to&#xD;
      invasive carcinoma can vary depending on the initial grade of lesion and it is generally&#xD;
      accepted that high-grade lesions are more likely to progress to invasive cancer than&#xD;
      low-grade lesions. Early detection and treatment of these lesions is critical to improving&#xD;
      survival. There is no evidence base examining how, or whether these high-grade lesions (HGLs)&#xD;
      should be treated, resulting in diverse treatment practices both nationally and&#xD;
      internationally. This is the first randomised clinical trial of a bronchoscopic intervention&#xD;
      in treating HGLs using PDT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Treatment-arm patients will receive two courses of PDT treatment using the&#xD;
      photosensitiser drug Fotolon®. Fotolon®, which preferentially accumulates in HGLs, is first&#xD;
      administered via IV infusion. Patients then undergo bronchoscopy during which their HGLs are&#xD;
      irradiated with red light (via non-heat emitting laser). Red-light activation of the&#xD;
      photosensitiser causes chemical transformation of the cells and cell death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow Up: Follow up in both arms consists of AFB surveillance at 6 and 12 months, then every&#xD;
      6-12 months (depending on the appearance of lesions), with annual CT scanning of the thorax,&#xD;
      and annual spirometry. Biological samples for translational analysis will be taken at&#xD;
      baseline and each subsequent trial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of recruitment: Anticipated recruitment for phase II is 1 year (12 months), and an&#xD;
      additional 2 years (24 months) for the phase III.&#xD;
