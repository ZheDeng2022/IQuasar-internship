  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a genetic, degenerative neurological disease that affects&#xD;
      individuals in their third-fourth decade of life and individuals can live 15-20 years with&#xD;
      manifest HD. The complex disease symptoms, including motor, cognitive and behavioural&#xD;
      impairments, result in loss of functional independence and progressive escalation of&#xD;
      healthcare costs. The personal, social and economic consequences of HD are devastating,&#xD;
      especially as there are currently no disease modification therapies available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Environmental factors, including exercise and physical activity, have the potential to&#xD;
      minimize the functional impact of HD. Animal models of HD have provided the first evidence&#xD;
      that exercise has the potential to delay or alter disease progression. A range of studies in&#xD;
      clinical populations have shown that short-term exercise (&lt; 3 months) is well tolerated and&#xD;
      has the potential to improve quality of life, fitness and motor impairments in HD. Despite&#xD;
      these promising studies, there are critical knowledge gaps that prevent the intelligent&#xD;
      application of exercise as a therapeutic intervention in HD. Firstly, there have been no&#xD;
      prospective evaluations of the potential role of physical activity and exercise in disease&#xD;
      modification in HD. To date, only retrospective data has suggested that lifestyle factors,&#xD;
      including sedentary behavior, could negatively affect disease progression in HD. Secondly, it&#xD;
      is not known if sustained exercise (&gt; 3 months) is feasible, and if it has the potential to&#xD;
      improve cognitive outcomes, such as has been shown in other neurodegenerative diseases. Such&#xD;
      longer-term studies are essential to elucidate the potential for exercise to have a&#xD;
      disease-modifying effect; the mechanisms through which such improvement may occur have yet to&#xD;
      be explored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, the investigators will employ a systematic approach for routinely collecting&#xD;
      prospective physical activity and fitness data and monitoring physical activity behaviour in&#xD;
      120 individuals with HD. The investigators will use a database to track physical activity and&#xD;
      exercise behaviour alongside standardized disease-specific outcome measures during two annual&#xD;
      visits. Assessment will incorporate VO2max, a surrogate measure of fitness and a direct&#xD;
      measure of oxygen uptake related to central nervous system (CNS) function and structure, and&#xD;
      the use of wearable technologies (Gene-activ activity monitors) that capture and quantify&#xD;
      dose (frequency, duration, intensity) of physical activity in a large HD cohort. The&#xD;
      investigators will further conduct a within-cohort randomized control trial (RCT) of a&#xD;
      12-month exercise intervention in HD, comparing a supported structured aerobic exercise&#xD;
      training program to activity as usual. This intervention will also incorporate a physical&#xD;
      activity coaching program developed and evaluated by our group with a view to encouraging&#xD;
      longer term exercise uptake.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Huntington's disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease causing dysfunction and death of&#xD;
      medium spiny striatal projection neurons and thus disruption of corticostriatal pathways with&#xD;
      resultant impairment of cognition, motor function, and behaviour. These impairments result in&#xD;
      decreasing independence in activities of daily living and quality of life even from&#xD;
      relatively early in the disease. The potential to develop interventions to facilitate&#xD;
      independent living and strategies to manage symptoms is crucial to managing both the personal&#xD;
      and economic effects of this devastating disease. Although to date there are no successful&#xD;
      pharmacological interventions that are able to slow disease progression, there is now clear&#xD;
      emerging evidence of disease specific motor function and general health benefits of shorter&#xD;
      exercise in HD. Although it has been possible to successfully deliver exercise and behaviour&#xD;
      change interventions in HD over the shorter term, there is now a need to conduct studies that&#xD;
      actively facilitate exercise adherence over a longer term (e.g. one year) to realistically&#xD;
      begin to assess the impact of physical activity and structured exercise on disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic exercise interventions present an exciting, transformative area of research in&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. Addressing motor impairments in neurodegeneration may provide a&#xD;
      long-term beneficial effect in delaying disease progression and maximizing functional&#xD;
      abilities over a longer period. Loss of independent mobility and care dependency have been&#xD;
      shown to be important predictors of nursing home admissions. The potential to develop&#xD;
      interventions that facilitate independent living and strategies to manage symptoms is crucial&#xD;
      to managing both the personal and economic effects of this devastating disease. Although to&#xD;
      date there are no successful pharmacological or other interventions that are able to slow&#xD;
      disease progression, there is some suggestion that lifestyle factors, such as activity level&#xD;
      and education alongside specific motor training may help to drive compensatory neural&#xD;
      networks, that may in turn compensate for the failing brain, and change the course of the&#xD;
      disease. Studies to date in HD have relied on retrospective data, and robust evaluation of&#xD;
      lifestyle factors contributing to disease progression is needed. If shown to be effective,&#xD;
      exercise programs have the potential to be used in combination with disease-modifying drugs,&#xD;
      cell replacement therapy or genetic manipulations, when available, to maximize the functional&#xD;
      benefits of these interventions by facilitating adaptive neuroplasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have set out to systematically evaluate the feasibility of exercise and&#xD;
      physical activity interventions in people with HD using a two-pronged approach. The first&#xD;
      approach evaluated the feasibility of short-term aerobic and strengthening exercise programs&#xD;
      in HD. This led to the recently completed study funded by the Gossweiler Foundation,&#xD;
      Exert-HD, a 3-month randomized controlled trial of aerobic (performed between 60-85% age&#xD;
      predicted heart rate max) and strengthening exercise. Participants in the exercise group&#xD;
      demonstrated significantly improved predicted VO2 max and Unified Huntington Disease Rating&#xD;
      Scale (UHDRS) modified Motor Scores (mMS), but no effect was seen on cognition or other&#xD;
      measures of motor function.This study had high retention and adherence, and was well&#xD;
      tolerated by participants. Alongside this, there was the development and evaluation of the&#xD;
      feasibility of a behavioural change intervention to increase levels of physical activity&#xD;
      (Engage-HD; ISRCTN65378754). The intervention aimed to evaluate the efficacy of a physical&#xD;
      activity intervention (6 sessions over 14 weeks) utilizing a workbook-based behavioural&#xD;
      change program compared to a social contact control. This study demonstrated improvements in&#xD;
      self-reported physical activity, self-efficacy for exercise, and cognition, however no&#xD;
      changes were noted for HD-specific motor function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In PACE-HD the investigators seek to address three issues that naturally arise from the&#xD;
      preliminary studies completed to date. First, there has been no evaluation of long-term (e.g.&#xD;
      12 month) aerobic and strengthening exercise interventions in HD. While studies to date have&#xD;
      demonstrated improvements in motor and cognitive function in the short term, it is unclear&#xD;
      whether exercise behaviour can be maintained over a longer term, and to what degree any&#xD;
      improvements in cognition or motor function can be maintained or enhanced with a longer term&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, there is a lack of understanding of the role of physical activity in disease&#xD;
      progression in HD. Preliminary work has utilized 7 day activity monitors that have improved&#xD;
      functionality to obtain more detailed data on physical activity behavior, including light and&#xD;
      moderate- vigorous physical activity, sedentary behavior and sleep patterns over the&#xD;
      intervention period. In this trial, the investigators will utilize 7 day activity monitors to&#xD;
      evaluate activity patterns longitudinally over a year period in a cohort of 120 people with&#xD;
      HD. This longitudinal evaluation alongside standardized evaluations of motor, cognitive and&#xD;
      functional abilities will aid in validation of wearable activity devices and evaluate how&#xD;
      physical fitness and physical activity may be related to disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, there is lack of understanding of the mechanisms by which exercise may achieve its&#xD;
      effect in HD. Trials of longer term exercise interventions are difficult to deliver, not&#xD;
      least in terms of the complexity of the intervention but also due to the challenges in&#xD;
      accurately characterising the different dimensions of real-life physical activity and&#xD;
      understanding individual response to exercise. Our preliminary research has shown that&#xD;
      exercise has the potential to improve aerobic fitness using measurements of estimated&#xD;
      (predicted) VO2max. This trial will incorporate longitudinal assessment of VO2max, a&#xD;
      surrogate measure of fitness and a direct measure of oxygen uptake that is related to central&#xD;
      nervous system (CNS) function and structure.&#xD;
