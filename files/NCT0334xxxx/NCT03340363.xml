      The purpose of this study is to examine the impact of environmental modifications (choice&#xD;
      architecture and a marketing campaign) in combination with weekly text messages on purchases&#xD;
      of foods made by parents shopping in a large supermarket.&#xD;

      The &quot;Make It Fresh, For Less&quot; Supermarket Pilot Study is a supermarket-based intervention&#xD;
      developed by the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health in collaboration with the&#xD;
      nonprofit organization ChopChop Magazine (chopchopmagazine.org) and a large Northeastern&#xD;
      supermarket chain. A promotional campaign advertising low-cost, kid-friendly meals was&#xD;
      piloted in one store selected by the supermarket partner, with promotions rotating every 4&#xD;
      weeks during a 16-week intervention period. Parent shoppers were recruited (n=401) at the&#xD;
      store and given a study loyalty card to track their transactions. At the start of the&#xD;
      intervention, half of the participants were additionally randomized to receive weekly&#xD;
      behavioral messages via text message or email. Supermarket purchases were assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, during the 16-week intervention, and up to 6-weeks post-intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 1: to examine the impact of a choice architecture intervention in combination&#xD;
      with a promotional campaign on food purchases of parents shopping in a large supermarket. It&#xD;
      is hypothesized that there will be an increase in selection of foods targeted by the&#xD;
      promotional campaign when physical modifications are made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim 2: to examine the impact of weekly behavioral messages in combination with an&#xD;
      environmental change intervention on food purchases of parents shopping in a large&#xD;
      supermarket. It is hypothesized that there will be a greater increase in selection of foods&#xD;
      targeted by the promotional campaign among participants receiving the messages compared to&#xD;
      participants exposed to the environmental change intervention alone.&#xD;

    <measure>Acceptability of intervention (self-reported survey measures)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Shopper responses to survey questions asking participants to rate the acceptability of each recipe (taste, cost, difficulty, perceptions of children's preferences) on a Likert scale from 1-5.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Recall of intervention (self-reported survey measures)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 6 weeks post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Shopper responses to survey questions regarding aided and unaided recall. Unaided recall asks shoppers to choose the best description of what they saw in the store and aided recall asks shoppers whether they remember seeing various elements of the display in the store (yes, no, not sure). These measures will be combined to report the proportion of shoppers who recalled each component of the intervention either through aided or unaided means.</description>
