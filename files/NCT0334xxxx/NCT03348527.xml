      A Single Blind, Two-Stage Dose Finding Study to Evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and&#xD;
      Efficacy of a Single Liproca® Depot Injection into the Prostate in Patients with Localized&#xD;
      Prostate Cancer,Assigned to Active Surveillance who are at High Risk for Disease Progression&#xD;
      (followed by an Open Label Extension with a Repeat Injection (Optional))&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>

      Patients assigned to Active Surveillance and who have fulfilled all inclusion criteria will&#xD;
      receive a prophylactic antibiotic and a local anaesthetic (according to the Investigator's&#xD;
      Standard of Care) prior to administration of Liproca® Depot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 subjects will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Single Dose Study will be conducted in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage I, 20 subjects will be randomized into two groups to receive one dose of Liproca®&#xD;
      Depot equal to 35% (Cohort 1) or 45 % (Cohort 2) of their prostate volume (mL) (N=10:10). Two&#xD;
      weeks after all subjects have received their initial dose, the Data Safety Monitoring Board&#xD;
      (DSMB) will review the subjects' safety and tolerability data over the first 14 days after&#xD;
      receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Stage II, 40 subjects will be randomized to receive either 16mL (Cohort 3) or 20mL (Cohort&#xD;
      4) of Liproca® Depot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in Stage I and Stage II will be followed for 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who complete the Single Dose Study and who experience no safety or tolerability&#xD;
      issues, as determined by the Investigator, may be offered an option to participate in the&#xD;
      Open Label Extension Study (OLE). Subjects enrolled in the OLE will be observed for PSA&#xD;
      recurrence every 8 weeks. If PSA recurrence is confirmed (defined as a PSA level exceeding at&#xD;
      least 100 % of Baseline value) subjects will receive a second treatment of Liproca® Depot.&#xD;
      The dose will be injected into the tumour focus/foci and in close proximity to the tumour,&#xD;
      based on a prostate biopsy (and MRI, if applicable), using a TRUS for guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I subjects who received 35% volume of Liproca® Depot will receive 16 mL and subjects&#xD;
      who received 45% volume of Liproca® Depot will receive 20 mL. Stage II subjects will receive&#xD;
      the same dose of Liproca® Depot that was administered in the first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the OLE receiving a second injection will be followed up for an additional 24&#xD;
      weeks for safety, tolerability and efficacy. After this period, subjects may undergo MRI&#xD;
      imaging and a prostate biopsy.&#xD;
