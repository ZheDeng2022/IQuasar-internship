  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic kidney disease patients with sarcopenic obesity are noted to have impairment in&#xD;
      physical performance and reducing their quality of life, and the investigators also founded&#xD;
      these patients are at higher risk of mortality. Thus, the investigators hypothesize that oral&#xD;
      nutrition intervention could increase lean tissue mass in these patients and improve the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients, disease- and age- related changes in body&#xD;
      composition, as well as the increased prevalence of obesity, determine a combination of&#xD;
      excess weight and reduced muscle mass or strength, recently defined as sarcopenic obesity.&#xD;
      The prevalence of sarcopenic obesity increase with lower eGFR, and previous studies showed&#xD;
      that up to 18.3% stage 4 CKD patients and 56% prevalent hemodialysis patient to be with&#xD;
      sarcopenic obesity. Sarcopenic obesity was negatively correlated with physical performance&#xD;
      and quality of life. In the investigator's previous study, nondialysis-dependent CKD patients&#xD;
      with normal body mass index (BMI) but excess body fat had the highest risk of death compared&#xD;
      to those with BMI above the cutoff for obesity and excess body fat during a follow up of 5&#xD;
      years. These patients with excess body fat but lower lean tissue mass was what so called&#xD;
      &quot;sarcopenic obesity&quot; group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodialysis therapy per se has been shown to be a catabolic process. Pupim et al. showed&#xD;
      that in eight malnourished patients undergoing hemodialysis, highly positive whole-body net&#xD;
      protein balance during hemodialysis and improvement of skeletal muscle protein homeostasis&#xD;
      was achieved with an intradialytic oral nutritional supplement (ONS) compared to the control,&#xD;
      and ONS during hemodialysis resulted in persistent anabolic benefits for muscle protein&#xD;
      metabolism in the posthemodialysis phase. In the past, randomized trials of nutritional&#xD;
      supplement intervention in dialysis patients were focused on populations with protein energy&#xD;
      wasting, and most studies used change in serum albumin concentration as the surrogate marker.&#xD;
      Studies focused on dialysis patients with sarcopenic obesity are sparse. Therefore, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that ONS could improve the nutritional status among dialysis&#xD;
      patients with sarcopenic obesity, especially increase in lean tissue, and improve clinical&#xD;
      outcomes. This pilot/feasibility study is aimed to conduct a randomised controlled pilot&#xD;
      trial of the feasibility of undertaking a study to assess the effect of ONS on the&#xD;
      nutritional status of haemodialysis patients with sarcopenic obesity and will lead to a more&#xD;
      robust definitive trial in the future.&#xD;
