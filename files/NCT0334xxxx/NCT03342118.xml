  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gastric peristalsis, which occurs during the endoscopic procedure, limits the visual&#xD;
      inspection of the inspection field, causing interference in the inspection. The actual&#xD;
      endoscopic examination is most commonly used by injecting Hyoscine butylbromide(Buscopan®),&#xD;
      Cimetropium bromide (Algiron ®) into intravenous or muscular injection so it is not suitable&#xD;
      for patients who undergo non-sedative esophagogastroduodenoscopy. In addition, these drugs&#xD;
      were reported the side effects including thirst, dysuria, transient visual filed defect,&#xD;
      tachycardia, anxiety so were not recommended for benign prostate hyperplasia, glaucoma, old&#xD;
      age patients. For comfort and succesfull test, anti-spasmodics which don't have&#xD;
      anti-cholinergic effect and are possible to take orally is necessary. Phloroglucin(Flospan®)&#xD;
      is a smooth muscle relaxant that is currently used in the anti-spasmodic treatment without&#xD;
      anticholinergic action so it can be administered in patients with glaucoma or BPH. Also it is&#xD;
      suitable for endoscopic premedication due to transparent liquid component. Therefore, in this&#xD;
      study, we would like to confirm the efficacy and safety of Phloroglucin (Flospan ®), which&#xD;
      can be taken orally, as an pre-medication for non-sedative endoscopy.&#xD;

      Background : Endoscopy is currently widely regarded as the most important test in diagnosing&#xD;
      stomach disorders, including stomach cancer. Gastric peristalsis, which occurs during the&#xD;
      endoscopic procedure, limits the visual filed of the inspection, causing interference in the&#xD;
      inspection. The actual endoscopic examination is most commonly used by injecting Hyoscine&#xD;
      butylbromide(Buscopan®), Cimetropium bromide (Algiron ®) into intravenous or muscular&#xD;
      injection so it is not suitable for patients who undergo non-sedative endoscopy because&#xD;
      intravenous assessment is unnecessary. In addition, these drugs were reported the side&#xD;
      effects including thirst, dysuria, transient visual filed defect, tachycardia, anxiety so&#xD;
      were not recommended for patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia, glaucoma, old age.&#xD;
      Actually patients who undergo non-sedative endoscopy are used to perform examinations without&#xD;
      using anti-spasmodics. In this case, gastric peristalsis restricts endoscopist's visibility&#xD;
      and making accurate observation and prolonged inspection time increases patient's discomfort.&#xD;
      For comfort and successfull test, anti-spasmodics which don't have anti-cholinergic effect&#xD;
      and are possible to take orally is necessary. Phloroglucin(Flospan®) prompts to release&#xD;
      norepinephrine by impeding catecholamine O-methyl transferase enzymes in visceral smooth&#xD;
      muscle, so it works to control spasm by normalizing smooth muscle movement which was&#xD;
      accelerated by acetylcholine. Phloroglucin(Flospan®) is a smooth muscle relaxant that is&#xD;
      currently used in the anti-spasmodic treatment without anticholinergic action so it can be&#xD;
      administered in patients with glaucoma or BPH. Also it is suitable for endoscopic&#xD;
      premedication due to transparent liquid component. Therefore, in this study, we would like to&#xD;
      confirm the efficacy and safety of Phloroglucin (Flospan ®), which can be taken orally, as an&#xD;
      pre-medication for non-sedative endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim : Analysis for the effects of Phloroglucin (Flospan ®) as pre-medication for non-sedative&#xD;
      endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods : This study is a single center, prospective, double blinded, randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial that will be performed in Keimyung University Dongsan medical center. A&#xD;
      total of 134 patients aged 18 to 80 are enrolled and patients were randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      test group and the placebo group, taking the test drug or placebo 10 minutes before the&#xD;
      endoscopy. The endoscopist records the degree of peristaltic movement and the degree of&#xD;
      difficulty of the test at the start and end of the test. The degree of the peristalsis and&#xD;
      the discomfort of the examination are evaluated by the scale used in the previous study. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to evaluate the patient's discomfort after drug administration,&#xD;
      the taste of the drug, and the intention to re-use the drug.&#xD;
