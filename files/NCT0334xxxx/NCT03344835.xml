      Prostate cancer (PCa) is ranked 3rd in annual incidence of male cancer and ranked 5th for&#xD;
      cancer-related death in men in Hong Kong which accounts for about 9.1 deaths per 100,000 men&#xD;
      in 2011. Its incidence is rising rapidly, almost tripled in the past 10 years. In Hong Kong,&#xD;
      the two main screening methods for PCa are digital rectal examination (DRE) and serum&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level blood test, and the gold standard of diagnosis of PCa&#xD;
      is transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) with prostate biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those who diagnosed with PCa, there are different kinds of managements depending on&#xD;
      patient's age group and disease stage. Watchful waiting is for older patients who presents&#xD;
      with low-risk prostate cancer. And active surveillance is applicable to patients who are&#xD;
      eligible for potentially curative management. While radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy are&#xD;
      recommended as curative management for early stage PCa, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is&#xD;
      the main treatment modality for advanced or recurrent prostate cancer. Advanced prostate&#xD;
      cancer that recurrence is called castration refractory prostate cancer (CRPC). There are many&#xD;
      new agents, including second line hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, androgen biosynthesis&#xD;
      inhibitors, immunotherapy, bone targeting agents etc., available for the further management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators would like to establish a local prostate cancer registry to&#xD;
      facilitate the collection of clinical information and outcomes of prostate cancer management.&#xD;
      Hopefully, this registry can provide information regarding the epidemiology, natural history,&#xD;
      and treatment outcomes of local prostate cancer. The information would be helpful for&#xD;
      research, public education, health care planning and also international collaboration.&#xD;
      Ultimately, patients and public would be benefited from these works.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prostate gland is a clinically important male accessory sex gland and vital for its&#xD;
      production of semen. Prostate cancer (PCa) is ranked 3rd in annual incidence of male cancer&#xD;
      and ranked 5th for cancer-related death in men in Hong Kong which accounts for about 9.1&#xD;
      deaths per 100,000 men in 2011. Its incidence is rising rapidly, almost tripled in the past&#xD;
      10 years. Although this cancer is extremely rare before age 40 but the incidence increases&#xD;
      with age, as the elderly population continues to increase, the impact of PCa on the men's&#xD;
      health and also the burden on health care system will continue to rise. In addition to age,&#xD;
      epidemiological data shows that race is also an important risk factor for prostate cancer.&#xD;
      African-American men have the highest rates of prostate cancer in the world. For Asian&#xD;
      populations, native Chinese and Japanese showed the lowest prostate cancer rates, though the&#xD;
      incidence is rapidly increasing in the past decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two main screening methods for PCa are digital rectal examination (DRE) and serum&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level blood test. DRE is an exam to check for growths or&#xD;
      enlargement of the prostate gland. A tumor in the prostate can often be felt as a hard&#xD;
      nodule. This may be done as a regular exam or check for the symptoms. If problems are&#xD;
      suspected, DRE is usually done together with PSA, which was first introduced to evaluate the&#xD;
      possibility of present of PCa in 1987. A common PSA threshold for biopsy in Hong Kong and&#xD;
      Asia is PSA level greater than 4.0 ng/mL. Despite the controversial of PSA and some newer&#xD;
      markers for PSA diagnosis, it is still the most common screening for PCa, due to the low cost&#xD;
      and simplicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gold standard of diagnosis of PCa is transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) with prostate biopsy.&#xD;
      During the procedure, usually ten cores of biopsies will be taken and sent for pathological&#xD;
      evaluation. If any of the biopsies are found malignant, Gleason score will be given and the&#xD;
      stage of cancer will be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Unlike other malignancy, PCa is characterized by its slow progression nature and even for&#xD;
      metastatic disease the 5-year survival is up to 20%. Therefore, there will be different kinds&#xD;
      of management for difference age group and disease stage: active surveillance (AS), watchful&#xD;
      waiting, and treatments. Watchful waiting is for older patients who presents with low-risk&#xD;
      prostate cancer. In these cases, treatment is probably not suitable for them due to the old&#xD;
      age and low effectiveness. Contrasting watchful waiting, AS is applicable to patients who are&#xD;
      eligible for potentially curative management. During AS, PCa is closely monitored for signs&#xD;
      of progression. PSA blood test and DRE are usually administered at times along with a repeat&#xD;
      biopsy of the prostate at one year and then at specific intervals thereafter. If symptoms&#xD;
      develop, or if tests indicate the cancer is growing, treatment will be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For early stage of prostate cancer, radiotherapy or radical prostatectomy are recommended as&#xD;
      curative management. The purpose of these treatments is to cure the disease. Over 80% of&#xD;
      patients were cured with no recurrence. Currently, robotic prostatectomy is the main surgical&#xD;
      approach for localized prostate cancer with acceptable perioperative results. Radiotherapy,&#xD;
      both external beam and brachytherapy, are also standard therapy for prostate cancer. The&#xD;
      overall complication rate, as reported from the Western literatures, for both surgery and&#xD;
      radiotherapy are quite low. The final choice of treatment will largely depend on the join&#xD;
      decision between physicians and patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, for advanced or recurrent prostate cancer, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) is the&#xD;
      main treatment modality. While the effectiveness of ADT is well documented in the literature,&#xD;
      the adverse effect profile in Asian patients, in particular to the cardiovascular system and&#xD;
      bone metabolism, was not well documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the continue changes in the behavior of prostate cancer cell under androgen deprivated&#xD;
      environment, advanced prostate cancer will eventually entered a stage of castration&#xD;
      refractory prostate cancer (CRPC). Currently, there are many new agents, including second&#xD;
      line hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, androgen biosynthesis inhibitors, immunotherapy, bone&#xD;
      targeting agents etc., available for the further management of these CRPC patients.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, the clinical outcome and side effect profiles for further treatment for&#xD;
      patients with in local Chinese population, as well as in Asian population was still not that&#xD;
      certain.&#xD;

      certain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Facing the increase in clinical demand by the drastic increase in patient population,&#xD;
      together with the rapid development in various therapies for different stages of prostate&#xD;
      cancer, there is a need to have better understanding about the natural history, clinical&#xD;
      outcomes of various therapies for prostate cancer. Therefore, investigators would like to&#xD;
      establish a local prostate cancer registry to facilitate the collection of clinical&#xD;
      information and outcomes of prostate cancer management. Hopefully, this registry can provide&#xD;
      information regarding the epidemiology, natural history, and treatment outcomes of local&#xD;
      prostate cancer. The information would be helpful for research, public education, health care&#xD;
      planning and also international collaboration. Ultimately, patients and public would be&#xD;
      benefited from these works&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, both retrospective and prospective cohort study design will be adopted.&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with prostate cancer from 2016 will be captured prospectively and those&#xD;
      who diagnosed in or before 2015 will be captured retrospectively. Patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      prostate cancer in the hospitals under the New Territories East Cluster (NTEC) &amp; New&#xD;
      Territories West Cluster (NTWC) will be identified in specialist clinics, wards, and during&#xD;
      TRUS, and then enrolled to the study. This study will be conducted by observation; no&#xD;
      intervention article is used. The time of diagnosis of prostate cancer will be set as&#xD;
      baseline of that subject. All the demographic and medical background will be traced back. All&#xD;
      patients will be followed up every 6 months and thereafter. During the follow-up, patients'&#xD;
      medical status including survival, cancer status, treatment, complications will be captured&#xD;
      from the medical records.&#xD;
