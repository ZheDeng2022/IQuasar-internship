  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research will determine the feasibility of delivering two behavioral weight loss&#xD;
      interventions for 1 year in adults with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)&#xD;
      who are overweight or obese. The study will also compare these two interventions in terms of&#xD;
      safety, acceptability, and tolerability. Last, this pilot trial will provide initial insight&#xD;
      into a) biological changes and b) changes in kidney growth with each of the two weight loss&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is characterized by development and&#xD;
      continued growth of numerous fluid-filled renal cysts that ultimately result in renal&#xD;
      failure. Similar to the general population, the prevalence of overweight and obesity have&#xD;
      been rising in ADPKD patients, effecting about two-thirds of individuals. Surprisingly, the&#xD;
      role of obesity in ADPKD progression is currently unknown. The investigators have novel&#xD;
      preliminary data that overweight and obesity are independently associated with substantially&#xD;
      faster kidney growth in ADPKD patients. Furthermore, in rodent models of ADPKD,&#xD;
      mild-to-moderate food restriction profoundly slows cyst growth and maintains renal function&#xD;
      via mechanisms including AMPK-activated kinase pathway activation and suppression of&#xD;
      mammalian target of rapamycin/S6 kinase signaling and insulin-like growth factor-1 levels.&#xD;
      Collectively, these data suggest that dietary restriction regimens may slow ADPKD&#xD;
      progression. Accordingly, the primary aim is to determine the feasibility of delivering a 1&#xD;
      year behavioral weight loss intervention program in 30 overweight/obese adults with ADPKD,&#xD;
      based on either daily caloric restriction (DCR) or intermittent fasting (IMF), with a similar&#xD;
      (~34%) targeted weekly energy deficit. A key secondary goal is to evaluate safety,&#xD;
      acceptability, and tolerability of IMF in ADPKD versus DCR. Last, the third exploratory aim&#xD;
      is to a) obtain mechanistic insight into biological pathways that may be altered and b)&#xD;
      provide initial insight into any changes in total kidney volume by magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      with IMF and/or DCR.&#xD;
