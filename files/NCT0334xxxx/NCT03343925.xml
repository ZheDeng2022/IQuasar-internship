  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SHARP-C is an observational cohort study investigating the effect of direct-acting antiviral&#xD;
      (DAA) therapy and reinfection in people with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) and recent&#xD;
      injecting drug use. A prospective, observational cohort design will be used to enrol patients&#xD;
      attending tertiary drug and alcohol and primary health care services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be prescribed a direct-acting HCV medication as per the standard of care.&#xD;
      The on treatment phase will vary dependent on the type of a direct-acting antiviral&#xD;
      prescribed as per the standard of care. Once patients have completed their treatment course&#xD;
      they will be followed up every 3 months for up to 3 years following the end of treatment&#xD;
      phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will aim to evaluate the incidence of HCV reinfection following successful DAA&#xD;
      treatment over the three years of follow up. The study will also evaluate the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with undetectable HCV RNA at 12 weeks post end of treatment (SVR12) with&#xD;
      direct-acting anti-viral HCV therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In Australia, hepatitis C virus (HCV)-related morbidity and mortality have doubled in the&#xD;
      past decade, with health care costs of $220 million per annum1. This is due to a large,&#xD;
      ageing population with chronic infection (230,000), and low uptake of existing&#xD;
      interferon-based therapy (1-2% per year) due to side-effects, and sub-optimal therapy&#xD;
      efficacy. The majority of new (90%) and existing (80%) cases of HCV infection occur among&#xD;
      people who inject drugs (PWID).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the community, 15-20% of current PWID report recent (last month) receptive needle/syringe&#xD;
      sharing2. Qualitative research shows that decisions about sharing equipment are&#xD;
      multi-factorial and can include issues ranging from service access (such as distance to&#xD;
      service and opening hours), concerns about anonymity, perceptions that HCV is ubiquitous and&#xD;
      unavoidable3 to socially-located concerns that promote use of sterile equipment such as a&#xD;
      desire to avoid &quot;track marks&quot;4. There is no research that examines sharing of injecting&#xD;
      equipment in those with successful therapy in either community or prison settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing access to HCV therapy is a key objective of national and NSW Hepatitis C&#xD;
      Strategies5,6. The advent of well-tolerated, simple, oral hepatitis C virus (HCV) regimens -&#xD;
      direct acting antivirals (DAAs) - has the potential to transform this landscape. These are&#xD;
      much shorter, tolerable treatment regimens with cure &gt;95%, providing an opportunity to&#xD;
      reverse the rising burden of advanced liver disease. From 1st March 2016, these highly&#xD;
      efficacious HCV therapies have been listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme, and people&#xD;
      with recent injecting drug use are eligible to receive them. This is an important feature of&#xD;
      the listing. In many countries, people who have not ceased injecting drug use are ineligible&#xD;
      to receive DAA therapy7, despite the fact that they comprise a significant proportion of HCV&#xD;
      cases. Australia is therefore poised to lead the world in the scale-up of new therapies to an&#xD;
      extent that many countries with such exclusions will not be able to achieve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This feature of DAA access also affords unique opportunities with respect to the&#xD;
      implementation of treatment scale-up in community drug treatment clinics. Australia has good&#xD;
      treatment coverage for people who are opioid dependent, with over 50% of opioid dependent&#xD;
      people estimated to engage in opioid substitution therapy (OST) 8. Community-based drug&#xD;
      treatment clinics represent another logical venue for expansion of HCV care beyond existing&#xD;
      tertiary HCV treatment centres 9,10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although response to DAA HCV therapy is high, lower responses have been observed among people&#xD;
      with previous treatment experience9, cirrhosis9 and those with baseline or emergent&#xD;
      resistance associated variants10. Such resistance associated variants can persist for up to&#xD;
      two years after treatment11, affect re-treatment options12, and be transmitted to new&#xD;
      hosts13. Further, PWID are likely to be exposed to multiple HCV infections as a result of&#xD;
      ongoing high-risk behaviours and might commonly harbour mixed HCV infections (infection with&#xD;
      two or more distinct viruses) 14. Underlying mixed HCV infection can contribute to&#xD;
      nonresponse during therapy14, which has implications for DAA regimens that are preferentially&#xD;
      active against specific viral genotypes or subtypes. These data argue for surveillance of HCV&#xD;
      resistance and mixed HCV infection among PWID to resolve residual concerns regarding their&#xD;
      clinical and public health significance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two systematic reviews assessing interferon-based therapy for PWID have demonstrated&#xD;
      responses comparable to randomised controlled trials excluding PWID15, 16. These data have&#xD;
      supported international recommendations for the management of HCV for PWID 17. However, there&#xD;
      are limited data on DAA therapy among recent PWID. As treatment is broadened to include more&#xD;
      marginalised individuals, many clinicians are reluctant to treat HCV among PWID with recent&#xD;
      injecting drug use with new DAA therapies. Major concerns include poor adherence/response,&#xD;
      increased risk behaviour and HCV reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A major concern is that ongoing injecting risk behaviours following DAA therapy in PWID will&#xD;
      lead to HCV reinfection, reversing the benefits of cure. Ongoing risk behaviours following&#xD;
      successful HCV therapy may lead to reinfection and compromised treatment outcomes14. In a&#xD;
      systematic review and meta-analysis of HCV reinfection among PWID performed by the&#xD;
      investigators, the pooled estimate of re-infection was 2.2/100 p-yrs (95% CI, 0.9-6.1)&#xD;
      overall and 6.4/100 p-yrs (95% CI, 2.5-16.7) among individuals who reported injecting drug&#xD;
      use post-SVR16. The one study of HCV reinfection post-therapy in prison performed to date was&#xD;
      small (n=74), retrospective, and did not assess the rate of HCV reinfection18. Studies of&#xD;
      reinfection following HCV therapy are limited by small sample sizes, retrospective study&#xD;
      designs, incomplete follow-up, and a lack of sensitive methods to detect reinfection.&#xD;
      Further, there are no data on HCV reinfection among recent PWID treated with DAAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although DAA therapy could limit HCV-related disease burden, as treatment is broadened to&#xD;
      include more marginalised individuals, many clinicians are reluctant to treat HCV among&#xD;
      recent PWID, given concerns about poor adherence (and lower response to therapy), increased&#xD;
      risk behaviours (due to the ease and high cure rates of DAA HCV therapy) and HCV reinfection&#xD;
      (thereby reversing cure). However, no data exist on the extent to which this should be a&#xD;
      concern. Given that DAA HCV therapy is highly expensive, we urgently need data on the&#xD;
      magnitude of risk for, and predictors of, HCV reinfection. It is also unclear whether PWID&#xD;
      treated in these two settings will vary in their response to DAA therapy and risk for&#xD;
      reinfection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have an excellent track record of conducting high quality cohort studies&#xD;
      and clinical trials among PWID in the community19-23 and prison24, with high participant&#xD;
      retention in follow-up. The investigators have developed a network of clinical sites&#xD;
      providing HCV care in nine community-based drug treatment clinics20, 25. In SHARP-C the&#xD;
      investigators will explore the risk of HCV reinfection and treatment efficacy among recent&#xD;
      PWID with chronic HCV and recent injecting drug use.&#xD;
