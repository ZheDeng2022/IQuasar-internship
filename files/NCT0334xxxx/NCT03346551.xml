    <textblock>
      The specificity of postnatal depression (PND) was acted as full entity within the&#xD;
      depressions, by B. Pitt in 1968, through the description of a specific nosography which&#xD;
      describes &quot;an atypical depression of the post-partum &quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually, the epidemiological studies agree on prevalence from 10 to 15 % of PND. With two&#xD;
      peaks of frequency, the first one around the 6th and 12th week comment native and the second&#xD;
      during the second half-year. This rate of PND represents in France 75000 to 100000 women a&#xD;
      year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The professionals of the perinatal period are interested in this disorder because of the&#xD;
      consequences for the woman herself, and of the impact on the premature interactions&#xD;
      mother-baby. These interactions and the direct effects of the PND on the mother will have for&#xD;
      influence an important slowing down on the development of the baby. Moreover, the study of&#xD;
      Lemaitre and Candilis in 1999, brings the figure of 15 % of the PND which will have an impact&#xD;
      on the development of the baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensation of the depression testifies of a process of change and of psychic conflict&#xD;
      favored by the psychic transparency of the pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the first treaty on this specific nosography dates more than 150 years of numerous&#xD;
      questions stay suspends it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These questions and the reflections which surround them found on their path tools ensuing&#xD;
      from the theory of the attachment, formalized by John Bowlby. For more than three decades,&#xD;
      these profiles of attachment, specified by Mary Ainsworth: secure, anxious-ambivalent,&#xD;
      anxious-avoided and disorganized later, disrupted, is studied, estimated and their evolution&#xD;
      during a life is observed. Thanks to these models well known for the same person at a time t,&#xD;
      it is now their effects in the interpersonal relations which are studied. Between the people&#xD;
      but also on the person himself, its image of her, and its autobiographical memory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autobiographical memory represents a central component of the human memory. At a very&#xD;
      general level, it's possible to define it as the capacity of a person to remember its past&#xD;
      experiences. The review of the literature on the functioning of the episodic autobiographical&#xD;
      memory during the depression highlights three main results: the too bi generalization of the&#xD;
      memories, the congruence in the humor and the frequency of the intrusive memories&#xD;
      characterized by an involuntary reminder, fast and effortlessly (Lemogne and al., 2006;&#xD;
      Lemogne and al., 2012). The authors specify that there are links between strategies of&#xD;
      avoidance of the intrusive memories and the phenomenon of generalization. These links ask to&#xD;
      be explored within a model integrating, self and episodic autobiographical memory in the&#xD;
      field of the depression. The use of the memories defining the one could allow to study more&#xD;
      specifically this kind of memories. The memories defining the one were introduced to Ape and&#xD;
      Moffitt (1991) to characterize a specific category of autobiographical memories. The memories&#xD;
      defining the one are important personal memories which help a person to understand whom this&#xD;
      person is as individual. In a way, they build the life story and support the personal&#xD;
      identity. Connected to other similar memories, the self-defining memories contain numerous&#xD;
      sensory details and are often associated to a strong emotional charge. They are also&#xD;
      connected to long-term purposes, to concerns or to unsolved conflicts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies used the self-defining memories (French version adapted by Mr van der Linden's&#xD;
      team, Switzerland) as tool to understand better the psychological disorders from which&#xD;
      certain people suffer. The studies show that the self-defining memories undergo modifications&#xD;
      the characteristics of which are in connection with every pathology (works of the team of&#xD;
      J.M. Danion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1994, Moffit and al. studied a group of students with evaluation of the depressive&#xD;
      symptomatology. They established that the presenting subjects of high scores of depression&#xD;
      develop more generalized memories than the other participants when is asked to them a&#xD;
      self-defining memorie positive. For the memories with negative valence, no difference is&#xD;
      found among the tested students. There are no data in the literature on the self-defining&#xD;
      memories and the postnatal depression. Besides, there is only a single search, not published&#xD;
      which explores the links between the attachment and the memories defining the one (Tagini,&#xD;
      Conway and Meins, looks for not published, quoted by Conway, to Ape and Tagini, on 2004). The&#xD;
      authors present the results according to the styles of attachment. So, autobiographical&#xD;
      memories would vary according to the cognitive and emotional dimensions, in connection with&#xD;
      differences in the style of attachment. In every style of attachment would correspond certain&#xD;
      specificities in the contents and in the form of the self-defining memories.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this context, it seems important to look for if there are specificities concerning the&#xD;
      profiles of attachment and the self-defining memories at the patients suffering from&#xD;
      postnatal depression. Especially as the current literature approaches only little this&#xD;
      subject of public health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To analyze these specificities, two groups (group postnatal depression versus group control)&#xD;
      will compare by estimating the type of maternal attachment and theirs self-definig memories,&#xD;
      without omitting to look for a possible psychiatric pathology, and a personality problem at&#xD;
      the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study will be to highlight specificities of the style of&#xD;
      attachment and the personal identity in the postnatal depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study will on one hand be to look for the existence of links&#xD;
      between the various clinical variables in the postnatal depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And on the other hand to look for psychological and clinical factors which can be markers of&#xD;
      vulnerability and\or factors of protection of the depression comment native (comparison&#xD;
      between both groups of subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation to this study will be proposed to all the women of both centers, throughout&#xD;
      the inclusion. Those who will have accepted will fill a scale Edinburgh Post-natal Depression&#xD;
      Scale (EPDS). The score which will decide in which group women will be assigned :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &lt; 11 group control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &gt; 11 group PND The specific visit in the study will take place in a identical way for&#xD;
           the cases and the witnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be seen at first by a doctor a child psychiatrist who will make a data&#xD;
      collection sociodemographic and clinical and the signing of various questionnaires : Mini&#xD;
      International Neurospychiatric Interview (MINI), Adult Attachment Narratives (AAN), Camir&#xD;
      scale and Perceived Social Support Questionnaire (QSSP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondly, the patients will be seen by a psychologist to pursue the clinical evaluation&#xD;
      (Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Beck Depression Inventory and self-esteem scale (EES), Scale&#xD;
      of vocabulary (MILL-HILL) and to realize the signing of the questionnaire of the&#xD;
      self-defining memories.&#xD;
