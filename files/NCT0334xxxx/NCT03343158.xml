  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators propose to assess the sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative&#xD;
      predictive value of an HIV Risk Screening Tool in identifying the risk of being HIV-infected&#xD;
      among Orphans and Vulnerable Children (OVC) aged 2-18 years in a community setting.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the first phase of the study, investigators will identify an optimal set of screening&#xD;
      questions with acceptable sensitivity and false positive rate, based on the draft 11-question&#xD;
      pilot tool. Using the identified questions, investigators will develop a composite screening&#xD;
      tool and determine criteria that should be used for identifying children for testing with&#xD;
      minimally acceptable sensitivity and false positive rates. In the second phase of the study,&#xD;
      investigators will select optimal questions to create a composite screening tool and validate&#xD;
      it in a similar study population. Investigators anticipate the accuracy of the tool will be&#xD;
      much improved compared to the individual questions. Investigators will also assess the&#xD;
      usability of the HIV Risk Screening Tool as measured by the time taken to administer the&#xD;
      tool, and perceptions of its ease and simplicity.&#xD;
