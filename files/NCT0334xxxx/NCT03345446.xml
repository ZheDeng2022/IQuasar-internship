  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this American Heart Association-funded and NIH-funded study is to examine&#xD;
      circulating RNAs in the acute CHF setting, how they change with decongestive therapy, and&#xD;
      their function in vitro and in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are testing the hypothesis that ex-RNA levels change significantly during&#xD;
      decongestion therapy and can be used as a marker of those individuals who respond to CHF&#xD;
      therapy (in terms of cardiac structure or outcome). Additionally, the translational research&#xD;
      design allows the investigators to assay the effects of these RNAs on tissue phenotypes in&#xD;
      vitro.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 5 million people in the United States have congestive heart failure (CHF). Although&#xD;
      medical therapy such as beta-blockers, angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,&#xD;
      angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and aldosterone antagonists has improved prognosis, the&#xD;
      overall rate of hospital admissions has continued to rise in the last decade and the&#xD;
      mortality for patients with symptomatic heart failure remains worse than the majority of&#xD;
      cancers in this country. Accordingly, significant opportunities exist for the improvement in&#xD;
      outcomes of patients with CHF, both from a morbidity and mortality standpoint. Such&#xD;
      opportunities may lie in the outpatient medical management of patients with CHF. Specifically&#xD;
      acute CHF represents a particularly underserved area of CHF care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this regard, the investigative group and others have demonstrated the utility of&#xD;
      extracellular RNAs (short, 20-22 nucleotide RNA molecules stable in circulation in humans) to&#xD;
      predict cardiac structural changes and fibrosis in patients post-myocardial infarction with&#xD;
      significant changes in cardiac structure. However, little has been done looking at the acute&#xD;
      CHF setting. Specific questions include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What RNAs change in the acute CHF setting, and how do these change over time with&#xD;
           diuretic therapy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Are these changes in RNA functional? That is, do they cause characteristic changes in&#xD;
           the heart in vitro and on heart phenotypes in patients?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Do these RNAs predict outcomes in long-term follow-up?&#xD;
&#xD;
      To answer these questions, the investigators will enroll patients who are currently admitted&#xD;
      at MGH or BIDMC with acute CHF. The study protocol involves:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Venous blood draw, 40 ml anytime within their hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Venous blood draw, 40 ml within 48 hours of planned hospital discharge&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Venous blood draw, 40 ml at follow-up (within one year of discharge)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients (e.g., absence of standard MRI contraindications, GFR &gt; 40ml/min/1.73m2)&#xD;
      will be asked pre-discharge or by telephone contact after discharge about coming in for a&#xD;
      cardiac MRI study at any point within one year of discharge to examine cardiac&#xD;
      structure/function and fibrosis. MRI imaging will be performed by Partners investigators (Dr.&#xD;
      Ravi Shah, Dr. Michael Steigner, Dr. Michael Jerosch-Herold) at the 221 Longwood BRIC Imaging&#xD;
      Facility (at the Brigham and Women's Hospital, BWH).&#xD;
