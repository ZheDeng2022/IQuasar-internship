  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the present study is to investigate the clinical performance of the Metronom CGM&#xD;
      system in patients with type 1 diabetes over a period of 14 days. In this study, the CGM&#xD;
      sensor will be tested in an inpatient setting (meal/insulin test with frequent plasma glucose&#xD;
      monitoring) at different days of wear-time. Sensor data will be compared to gold standard&#xD;
      reference (Super GL2 analyser or YSI) and stability of sensor performance will be assessed&#xD;
      over time. Additionally, safety and tolerability of the sensor will be investigated by&#xD;
      regular assessment of the insertion site.&#xD;
