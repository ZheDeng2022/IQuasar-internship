      Study Objectives To compare the efficacy and safety of surgical treatment (PRK) versus&#xD;
      non-surgical treatment of anisometropic amblyopia in children who have failed conventional&#xD;
      treatment due to non-compliance or non-response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synopsis of Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A Patching Run-In Phase during which all participants are treated for at least 8 weeks&#xD;
           with continued refractive correction (with spectacles and/or contact lenses) and&#xD;
           patching prescribed 42 hours per week (averaging 6 hours daily) until no further&#xD;
           improvement over 2 consecutive visits at least 4 weeks apart or the vision no longer&#xD;
           meets eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A Randomized Trial Phase, beginning after no further VA improvement in the patching&#xD;
           run-in phase and qualifying amblyopia is still present, during which the participant is&#xD;
           assigned to either surgery with PRK and patching prescribed 2 hours per day or to&#xD;
           non-surgical treatment with continued refractive correction (with spectacles and/or&#xD;
           contact lenses) and patching prescribed 2 hours per day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is evaluating the efficacy of surgical treatment with PRK versus non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment of anisometropic amblyopia in children who have failed conventional treatment. The&#xD;
      primary analysis will be a treatment group comparison of the change in BCVA in the amblyopic&#xD;
      eye at the 8-month primary outcome visit. For participants wearing a contact lens, the BCVA&#xD;
      will be the visual acuity tested in the contact lens rather than in spectacles (or trial&#xD;
      frames).&#xD;

             does the contact lens fitting on the same day as enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Parent understands the protocol and is willing to accept randomization (if child meets&#xD;
             eligibility criteria after Patching Run-In Phase).&#xD;
