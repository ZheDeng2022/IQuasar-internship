    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, non-inferiority multicenter&#xD;
      clinical trial of azithromycin vs. placebo in adults presenting as outpatients with suspect&#xD;
      Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI) and a Procalcitonin (PCT) level of &lt; / = 0.25 ng/mL,&#xD;
      as a strategy for reducing antibiotic prescriptions. The study is designed to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of azithromycin versus placebo on Day 5 (i.e., after 4 days of treatment) in&#xD;
      subjects with suspect LRTI and PCT levels of &lt; / = 0.25 ng/mL at enrollment using a&#xD;
      non-inferiority approach. The study will recruit potential subjects 18 years of age or older&#xD;
      who are suspected to have LRTI. The enrollment cap will be 840 participants, for the goal of&#xD;
      approximately 674 randomized participants who will be randomized 1:1 to receive oral&#xD;
      azithromycin or placebo for five days. Randomized subjects will have efficacy measured from&#xD;
      the time of the first dose of study drug (Day 1) through approximately Day 28. The Primary&#xD;
      Objective is to compare the efficacy of azithromycin versus placebo on Day 5 (i.e., after 4&#xD;
      days of treatment) in subjects with suspect LRTI and PCT levels of &lt; / = 0.25 ng/mL at&#xD;
      enrollment using a non-inferiority approach.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>Adult participants, males and non-pregnant females, aged &gt;=18 years, presenting as outpatients with suspected Lower Respiratory Tract Infection (LRTI) with a Procalcitonin (PCT) level of &lt;=0.25 ng/mL were recruited from the community at large. Participants were enrolled between 08DEC2017 and 09MAR2020.</recruitment_details>

        <group group_id="P1">
          <title>Azithromycin</title>
          <description>500 mg of Azithromycin (2 capsules of 250 mg) administered orally as a single dose on Day 1, followed by 250 mg capsule of Azithromycin administered orally once daily for 4 days (Day 2 through Day 5).&#xD;
Azithromycin: Azithromycin is an azalide antibiotic and is derived from erythromycin used to treat many different types of infections caused by bacteria, such as respiratory infections.&#xD;
VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S Procalcitonin Test (PCT): The VIDAS B.R.A.H.M.S PCT is an automated test for use on the VIDAS instruments for the determination of human procalcitonin in human serum or plasma using the Enzyme-Linked Fluorescent Assay (ELFA) technique.</description>

As the safety profile of azithromycin is well established, and this trial was not powered to detect new, unknown safety signals, there was no azithromycin-related Adverse Event (AE) collection or Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) reporting during this study. Unanticipated adverse device effect (UADE) were unexpected, but were to be reported appropriately if they occurred during the study.</time_frame>
