  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic inflammation in rheumatoid arthritis is associated with adiposity, sarcopenia,&#xD;
      cachexia, reduced activity due to functional impairment, and anti-inflammatory drugs.&#xD;
      Patients frequently gain weight when taking anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF) medication,&#xD;
      prompting questions about the underlying mechanism and long-term cardiovascular and metabolic&#xD;
      tolerance associated with these drugs The primary objective of this study is to analyze the&#xD;
      impact of anti-TNF treatment during the first year of administration on the energy metabolism&#xD;
      of patients suffering from RA, assessed as an absolute value (before-after) and in comparison&#xD;
      with a standard measured in healthy matched subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Few studies have been focused on the combined evolution of body composition, energy&#xD;
      expenditure, physical activity, muscle performance, and nutritional intake in patients taking&#xD;
      anti-TNFs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study's objective is to assess the impact of anti-TNF treatment during the first year of&#xD;
      administration on the energy metabolism of RA patients, measuring variations in basal daily&#xD;
      energy expenditure and per type of expenditure using indirect calorimetry with calorimetric&#xD;
      chambers. Investigator also aim to define standardized values for RA patients compared to&#xD;
      healthy matched controls and to be able to monitor the evolution of these different values&#xD;
      during treatment compared to this standard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be an exploratory study with a longitudinal follow-up of the cohort in patients&#xD;
      treated in a market authorization context and involving a case/control study. Investigator&#xD;
      judged the inclusion of healthy controls justified by the current lack of data comparing the&#xD;
      different components of energy metabolism in active RA patients versus healthy subjects using&#xD;
      calorimetric chamber measurement. The aim is to obtain reference values to situate&#xD;
      RA-specific values in comparison before and after treatment. Investigator considered&#xD;
      selecting controls from the RA patients unjustified given how essential it is to commence&#xD;
      treatment in active RA cases (1 year with placebo not justifiable). A previously-treated&#xD;
      inactive RA population with no inflammation would not be comparable to patients with active&#xD;
      RA, and neither would a population with active RA treated with conventional treatment or a&#xD;
      different biotherapy to anti-TNFs. Investigator also chose to perform a second assessment at&#xD;
      6 months without calorimetric chamber measurement but rather an indirect measurement using&#xD;
      actimetry in order to limit costs and patients lost-to-follow-up due to treatment&#xD;
      modification (failure or intolerance), all the while maintaining full assessment at 12&#xD;
      months. Scheduling the assessment at 12 months is justified by published studies' reports of&#xD;
      delay before significant weight gain manifests, and enables us to maintain homogeneity as&#xD;
      regards variations in physical activity and nutritional intake linked to seasonal changes.&#xD;
