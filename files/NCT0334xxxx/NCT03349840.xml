  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to be performed in Qatar that will look at the comparison of glycemic control&#xD;
      in patients with type 2 diabetes on insulin glargine U100 with insulin degludec over the&#xD;
      Ramadan period, to determine whether better glycemic control with fewer hypoglycemic episodes&#xD;
      can be achieved.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label randomised prospective study that will involve 280 insulin-treated&#xD;
      patients with type 2 diabetes and who are receiving a basal insulin as part of their&#xD;
      treatment regimen. The power calculation suggests a subject number of 250 but to account for&#xD;
      a 10% drop out then 280 patients will be recruited competitively. To account for an estimated&#xD;
      30% screen failure then 400 patients will have to be screened. Of those eligible140 patients&#xD;
      will be randomized to insulin glargine U100 and 140 patients randomised to insulin degludec:&#xD;
      patients will be stabilised on that regimen so that the primary objective of the study to&#xD;
      compare glycemic control for those on insulin glargine U100 compared to those on insulin&#xD;
      degludec can be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin glargine U100 and insulin degludec will be given once daily in the evening before&#xD;
      Ramadan, 10-20 weeks prior to the onset of Ramadan as a run in period for stabilisation, and&#xD;
      to be given at Iftar (breaking of the fast) in the evening of Ramadan. In accord with the&#xD;
      latest International Diabetes Federation (IDF) guidelines the dose of both the glargine U100&#xD;
      and insulin degludec will be reduced by 15% during Ramadan&#xD;
      http://www.idf.org/sites/default/files/IDF-Diabetes and Ramadan&#xD;
      (DAR)-Practical-Guidelines-Final-Low.pdf), After Ramadan basal insulin will be increased to&#xD;
      that of the pre-Ramadan dose. In accord with the insulin degludec label guidelines (and those&#xD;
      of insulin glargine U100), a one to one dose will be implemented if switching from a single&#xD;
      basal injection; however, a dose reduction of 20% will be implemented if having to switch&#xD;
      from a twice daily basal injection (including those on twice daily insulin glargine U100&#xD;
      randomised to once daily insulin glargine U100). Thus, for those subjects already on once&#xD;
      daily insulin glargine U100 and randomised to insulin glargine U100 then no dose reduction&#xD;
      will be undertaken, nor will a dose reduction be undertaken for those subjects on once daily&#xD;
      insulin glargine U100 and randomised to insulin degludec.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral hypoglycemic agents will be on a stable dose that has not been altered in the preceding&#xD;
      12 weeks and will be continued unchanged through the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 10-20 week run in period to Ramadan fasting blood glucose will be titrated to less&#xD;
      than 5mmol/l (90 mg/dl)and insulin dose will be increased or decreased according to the&#xD;
      average of three previous fasting blood glucose measurements from the previous week (weekly&#xD;
      titration). During Ramadan fasting blood glucose will be measured before Iftar (breaking of&#xD;
      the fast) and will aim for a fasting blood glucose of 5mmol/l (90 mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Glycosylated hemoglobine (HbA1c) measurement will be done at baseline and 2-4 weeks before&#xD;
      Ramadan; two weeks after Ramadan and at the end of the 8 weeks study period following Ramadan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin dose will be increased by 2 units for FBG 7.1-7.9 mmol/L (120-140 mg/dl), 4 units&#xD;
      8.0-8.9 mmol/L (141-160 mg/dl), and 6 units 9.0 mmol/L (more than 160 mg/dl) and above.&#xD;
      Insulin dose will be decreased by 2 units for FBG 3.1-3.9 mmol/dl (55-70 mg/dl), decreased 4&#xD;
      units FBG &lt;3.1 mmol/L. During Ramadan fasting blood will be measured before Iftar. Titration&#xD;
      of insulin will be continued for the 8 weeks following Ramadan&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be contacted by a diabetes educator every 2 weeks by telephone to gather the&#xD;
      details of their glycemic control that will be discussed with the medical investigators to&#xD;
      alter their insulin dose and to report any hypoglycaemic events - all patients will be&#xD;
      encouraged to measure their blood glucose if a hypoglycaemic event occurs&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study patients will have the option to be converted back to their previous&#xD;
      basal insulin before the study. However, should they wish to continue on insulin glargine&#xD;
      U100/ then this will be available to be continued per local guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      End of study visit and determination if patient wants to continue with insulin&#xD;
      degludec/glargine U100 or to convert back to the basal insulin that they were on before the&#xD;
