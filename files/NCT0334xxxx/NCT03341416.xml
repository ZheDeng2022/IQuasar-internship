  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebellar ataxias are a group of disorders caused by cerebellar affections, for which&#xD;
      currently no specific treatment is available. Some limited studies verified the effects of&#xD;
      cerebellar transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on ataxic symptoms, with good results. The&#xD;
      hypothesis is that cerebellar TMS could improve ataxic symptoms in some patients and in these&#xD;
      patients, chronic cerebellar stimulation through deep brain stimulation could be a&#xD;
      therapeutic option. The rationale is to stimulate the dentate nucleus of the cerebellum in&#xD;
      order to balance the functional asymmetry observed between both motor cortices after chronic&#xD;
      cerebellar lesions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ten patients with cerebellar ataxia will be included in our protocol. Ataxia might be due to&#xD;
      several aetiologies, from degenerative to genetic and vascular diseases. The initial focus is&#xD;
      vascular and spinal cerebellar ataxias. The participants will be submitted to a&#xD;
      neuronavigation protocol for the precise location of the dentate nucleus contralateral to the&#xD;
      most symptomatic side. After that, the participants will be randomly assigned to 5 active or&#xD;
      5 placebo sessions of 1Hz TMS over the located area. After the first 5 sessions and a period&#xD;
      of at least 4 weeks washout, the participants will cross over and receive other 5 sessions,&#xD;
      active or sham. Clinical and video evaluations will be conducted before and after active and&#xD;
      sham cluster of sessions. The good responders, i.e., with over than 30% of improvement after&#xD;
      the active section will be eligible to bilateral dentate nucleus DBS. After that, again, a&#xD;
      cross-over double blind on-off stimulation will be performed. Each period (on or&#xD;
      0ff-stimulation) will last 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>After surgery patients will undergo a first washout period intended to allow their ataxia return to baseline (preoperative levels), thus avoiding post surgery effects bias.&#xD;
Phase 1: Participants will be randomized to either ON or OFF stimulation. The assigned stimulation will be performed for one week.&#xD;
Phase 2: Open label phase. All patients are in the ON stimulation condition and will be followed for 6 months.&#xD;
Duration:&#xD;
Phase 1 will last from one to 2 months and phase 2 will last six months.</intervention_model_description>
