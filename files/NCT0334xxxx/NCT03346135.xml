    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well daratumumab after a stem cell transplant works in&#xD;
      treating patients with multiple myeloma. Monoclonal antibodies, such as daratumumab, may kill&#xD;
      cancer cells that are left after chemotherapy.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the anti-myeloma activity of single-agent daratumumab post-autologous stem&#xD;
      cell transplantation (ASCT) as assessed by progression-free survival at 1 year post ASCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the extent of minimal residual disease (MRD) pre-/post-consolidation&#xD;
      treatment segment and at one year during the maintenance treatment segment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To characterize and evaluate toxicities, including type, frequency severity, attribution,&#xD;
      and duration (e.g., infections, secondary primary malignancies, peripheral neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To obtain estimates of overall response rate (stringent complete response [sCR],&#xD;
      complete response [CR], very good partial response [VGPR], and partial response [PR]),&#xD;
      response duration, depth of response, clinical benefit response, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Quantify CD38+ cells from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) fraction,&#xD;
      including T, natural killer (NK), and monocytic subsets using pre- and on-daratumumab&#xD;
      treatment samples by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assess possible changes in CD38+ expression, as well as the co-receptor marker CD31, and&#xD;
      possible correlation with response using pre- and on-daratumumab treatment samples by flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess cytokine levels in peripheral blood plasma. IV. Quantify CD38+ cells from the&#xD;
      bone marrow CD-138 negative fractions and acellular fractions, including T, NK, and monocyte&#xD;
      subsets using pre- and on-daratumumab treatment samples by flow cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Assess possible changes in CD38+ expression, as well as the co-receptor marker CD31, and&#xD;
      possible correlation with response using pre- and on-daratumumab treatment samples by flow&#xD;
      cytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Assess cytokine levels in the bone marrow acellular fraction. VII. Investigate CD38&#xD;
      cellular localization in multiple myeloma cells and extracellular vesicles from blood plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. Assess messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) expression in the PBMC, the bone marrow&#xD;
      CD130-negative fraction, the T cell fraction, and multiple myeloma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. If differences in CD38 expression are found, investigate epigenetic changes in CD38 mRNA&#xD;
      expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo standard of care ASCT with a conditioning regimen of melphalan. Beginning&#xD;
      60-120 days after ASCT, patients receive daratumumab intravenously (IV) every week for 8&#xD;
      weeks, every 2 weeks for 16 weeks, and then every 4 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence&#xD;
      of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 18 months.&#xD;
