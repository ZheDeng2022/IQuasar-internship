    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1 open-label 4-part study to evaluate the effect of food, cytochrome P450&#xD;
      inhibition and induction on the pharmacokinetics of CC 122 in healthy adult subjects.&#xD;
      Approximately 81 subjects will be enrolled. There will be approximately 24 subjects in Part 1&#xD;
      and approximately 19 subjects in Parts 2, 3, and 4, respectively. Subjects may participate in&#xD;
      1 part only.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will consist of 4 parts. Each part has two periods. The parts may be conducted in&#xD;
      any order. Subjects may participate in 1 part only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in a screening phase, a baseline phase in each study period, a&#xD;
      treatment phase in each study period and a follow-up telephone call. Subjects will be&#xD;
      screened for eligibility. Eligible subjects will return to the study center on Day -1 of&#xD;
      Period 1 and will remain at the study center until the last day of Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: On Day 1 of Period 1, eligible subjects will be randomized to 1 of 2 sequences. On&#xD;
      Day 1 of each study period, each subject will receive 1 of 2 treatments according to the&#xD;
      sequence in which he or she is randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, subjects will receive a single dose of CC-122 in Period 1 and, following an&#xD;
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of itraconazole plus one dose of itraconazole with CC-122&#xD;
      in Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 3, subjects will receive a single dose of CC-122 in Period 1 and, following an&#xD;
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of fluvoxamine plus one dose of fluvoxamine with CC-122&#xD;
      in Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 4, subjects will receive a single dose of CC-122 in Period 1 and, following an&#xD;
      appropriate washout, multiple doses of rifampin plus one dose of rifampin with CC-122 in&#xD;
      Period 2.&#xD;
