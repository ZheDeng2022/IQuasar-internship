  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effects of food additives on college students&#xD;
      with ADHD. This study could potentially answer an important question which still remains&#xD;
      unanswered as to whether certain food additives may be able to cause cognitive and electrical&#xD;
      activity changes in college students with and without ADHD. In this context, food additives&#xD;
      will be artificial food coloring.&#xD;

      Consent will be obtained at the first visit. Baseline data will be collected on the&#xD;
      participants, including height, weight, computerized cognitive functioning, and an EEG&#xD;
      recording. Participants will also be taught how to keep a detailed food and symptom diary&#xD;
      over the following week. One week later, the participant will return to the lab and turn in&#xD;
      the food/symptom diary. All ADHD participants and a subgroup of controls (called extended&#xD;
      controls or EC) will be trained on how to follow the dietary intervention. Detailed&#xD;
      information on the diet will be given, including food additives to avoid, healthy foods which&#xD;
      should be eaten, and shopping tips. For the next two weeks, the participant will follow the&#xD;
      dietary intervention at home with access to Dr. Holton to answer any questions. The&#xD;
      participant will return to the lab after following the diet for two weeks and assessments&#xD;
      (cognitive testing, and EEG) will be completed again along information on dietary compliance&#xD;
      will be collected. The third meeting will also mark the beginning of the first challenge&#xD;
      period. For the challenges, the participant will consume chocolate cookies every Monday,&#xD;
      Tuesday, and Wednesday for two weeks. The cookies may or may not contain artificial food&#xD;
      coloring depending on the week. Every Wednesday repeat testing will be completed after the&#xD;
      cookies are consumed. The participant will be asked not to take ADHD medication on testing&#xD;
      days. After two weeks of challenges the study will be completed. The participant will receive&#xD;
      information on their performance and on the study results overall.&#xD;

    <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) is an objective measure of brainwave activity that non-invasively records the electrocortical activity emitted from neuronal postsynaptic outputs using small electrodes placed on the head. Quantitative EEG uses techniques to transform electrocortical voltage amplitudes into frequency bands to reflect mental processes in periodicities instead of raw values. These frequency bands can then be compared before/after treatment and/or between groups to better understand how treatment impacts the brain. Resting-state EEG was collected with eyes-closed, but awake, for four minutes&#xD;
Frequency bands assessed: delta 1-4Hz, theta 4-7Hz, alpha 8-13Hz, beta 13-30Hz, gamma 30-50Hz Each frequency band was assessed using: mean power (microvolts^2 of a frequency band divided by the length of the frequency band) a</description>

    <description>Name: Adult ADHD Self-Report Scale-V1.1 Construct: Self-report checklist of adult ADHD symptoms to screen for possibility of ADHD. It is not meant to be diagnostic. According to the documentation, &quot;The questions in the ASRS v1.1 are consistent with DSM-IV criteria and address the manifestations of ADHD symptoms in adults.&quot; Total Range: 0-72 points - higher score indicates more and/or higher frequency of adult ADHD symptoms&#xD;
Sub-scores:&#xD;
Inattentive: sum of number/frequency of nine questions (taken from full ASRS questionnaire) related to inattention Range: 0-36 - higher score indicates more and/or higher frequency of inattention symptoms&#xD;
Hyperactive: sum of number/frequency of nine questions (taken from full ASRS questionnaire) related to hyperactivity Range: 0-36 - higher score indicates more and/or higher frequency of hyperactivity symptoms</description>

        <description>Electroencephalography (EEG) is an objective measure of brainwave activity that non-invasively records the electrocortical activity emitted from neuronal postsynaptic outputs using small electrodes placed on the head. Quantitative EEG uses techniques to transform electrocortical voltage amplitudes into frequency bands to reflect mental processes in periodicities instead of raw values. These frequency bands can then be compared before/after treatment and/or between groups to better understand how treatment impacts the brain.

Frequency bands assessed: delta 1-4Hz, theta 4-7Hz, alpha 8-13Hz, beta 13-30Hz, gamma 30-50Hz Each frequency band was assessed using: mean power (microvolts^2 of a frequency band divided by the length of the frequency band) a</description>
