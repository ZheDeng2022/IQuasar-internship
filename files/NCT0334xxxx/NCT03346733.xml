  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Serum cholesterol is a major modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease, which despite&#xD;
      considerable reduction in prevalence, remains the leading cause of premature mortality&#xD;
      worldwide. Although LDL-C continues to be recognized as the primary therapeutic target,&#xD;
      accumulating evidence suggests that alternative lipid parameters, non-HDL-C and apoB, may&#xD;
      provide predictive value beyond that of LDL-C alone, in most population categories. Numerous&#xD;
      lifestyle strategies have been developed to manage elevated cholesterol concentrations, of&#xD;
      which viscous fibre is often encouraged for its beneficial effects on LDL-C reduction.&#xD;
      Conversely, the effects of viscous fibre on new lipid markers, non-HDL and apoB, have yet to&#xD;
      be defined. Therefore, this study seeks to elucidate the therapeutic potential of psyllium&#xD;
      fibre on totality of atherogenic cholesterol and lipoprotein particles in a systematic review&#xD;
      and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Studies have identified viscous dietary fibre as potentially attenuating&#xD;
      cholesterol, including psyllium husk that reduces LDL-cholesterol (LDL-C) thus, may alleviate&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To update evidence on the effect of psyllium on LDL-C, and provide assessment of&#xD;
      its impact on new lipid markers: non-HDL cholesterol (non-HDL-C) and apolipoprotein-B (apoB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Conduct of the systematic review and meta-analysis will follow the Cochrane handbook&#xD;
      for systematic reviews of interventions. The reporting will follow the Preferred Reporting&#xD;
      Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Sources &amp; Study Selection: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL and The Cochrane Central Register of&#xD;
      Controlled Trials will be searched using appropriate search terms. Independent reviewers will&#xD;
      extract information about study design, sample size, subject characteristics, dose,&#xD;
      follow-up, and placebo/compare. RCTs that investigate the effect of psyllium fibre on LDL-C,&#xD;
      non-HDL-C or apoB will be included with a minimum follow-up period ≥ 3 weeks. The amount of&#xD;
      psyllium fibre must be reported and effects on outcomes LDL-C, non-HDL-C or apoB must be&#xD;
      isolatable. Studies detailing sufficient information for non-HDL-C calculation will also be&#xD;
      considered. Unpublished trials are considered and no restriction placed on language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: LDL-C, non-HDL-C, apoB&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Extraction: Mean±SEM values will be extracted for all outcomes. Standard computations&#xD;
      and imputations will be used to derive missing variance data. Risk of bias and overall study&#xD;
      quality will be assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool and GRADE approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Synthesis: Data will be pooled using the generic inverse variance method with random&#xD;
      effects models. Heterogeneity assessed by the Cochran Q-statistic and quantified by I2.&#xD;
      Sensitivity analysis and a priori subgroup analyses will be performed to explore sources of&#xD;
      heterogeneity. A spline curve model (MKSPLINE procedure) will be utilized to illustrate a&#xD;
      non-linear dose-response curve. Publication bias will be investigated by visual inspection of&#xD;
      funnel plots and formally tested using Egger's and Begg's tests. If significant, a Trim and&#xD;
      Fill analyses will be performed.&#xD;
