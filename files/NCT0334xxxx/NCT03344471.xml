      Each year in France, between 50,000 and 60,000 children are born prematurely (&lt; 37 weeks of&#xD;
      amenorrhea). Literature has shown that preterm deliveries can be associated with the&#xD;
      development of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) in mothers. Around ¼ of women suffer&#xD;
      from a PTSD after giving birth prematurely. Moreover, studies highlighted the consequences of&#xD;
      a PTSD on the child-mother relationship. Beyond the importance of early detection, it could&#xD;
      be important to predict factors that make women more likely to develop a PTSD. This study&#xD;
      will focus on personal factors (5 dimensions of personality). Our hypothesis is that&#xD;
      personality traits are associated with the likeliness of developing a PTSD after a preterm&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;

      PTSD : Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder. This syndrome can be found in people after they&#xD;
      experience a traumatic event. Literature has shown that preterm delivery can lead to the&#xD;
      development of PTSD in mothers. PTSD is characterized by symptoms such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Re-experiencing the trauma through intrusive distressing recollections of the event,&#xD;
           flashbacks, and nightmares.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Emotional numbness and avoidance of places, people, and activities that are reminders of&#xD;
           the trauma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Increased arousal such as difficulty sleeping and concentrating, feeling jumpy, and&#xD;
           being easily irritated and angered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each year in France, between 50,000 and 60,000 children are born prematurely (&lt; 37 weeks of&#xD;
      amenorrhea). Literature has shown that preterm deliveries are associated with the development&#xD;
      of PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) in mothers. Around ¼ of women suffer from a PTSD&#xD;
      after giving birth prematurely. Moreover, studies highlighted the consequences of a PTSD on&#xD;
      the child-mother relationship. Beyond the importance of early detection, it could be&#xD;
      important to predict factors that make women more likely to develop a PTSD. This study will&#xD;
      focus on personal factors (5 dimensions of personality). Our hypothesis is that personality&#xD;
      traits are associated with the likeliness of developing a PTSD after a preterm delivery. ) In&#xD;
      order to test our hypothesis, we will have two groups: (1) women who gave birth prematurely&#xD;
      and developed a PTSD and (2) women who gave birth prematurely and did not develop a PTSD.&#xD;
      Mothers will be recruited in the hospital of Reims a month after delivery. If they accept to&#xD;
      participate in the study, a face-to-face-1-hour appointment will be scheduled. During this&#xD;
      appointment, women of both groups will take a PTSD questionnaire (the PPQ - Perinatal PTSD&#xD;
      Questionnaire) as well as a personality test (the NEO-FFI, see outcome measures) to assess 5&#xD;
      dimensions of their personality (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeability and&#xD;
      Conscientiousness). Individual data will also be collected such as the age of the mother,&#xD;
      baby's birth weight, severity of prematurity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyzes will be performed to analyze our results. Student t will be used to&#xD;
      compare factors associated with PTSD between both groups. Correlation tests (such as&#xD;
      Bravais-Pearson) will also be used to highlight links between personality dimensions and the&#xD;
      likeliness to develop a PTSD after a preterm delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NB: Although no intervention is planned in this research, every woman getting a positive&#xD;
      score in the PPQ will be addressed to the department's psychologist.&#xD;
