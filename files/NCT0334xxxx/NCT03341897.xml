    <textblock>
      A varicocele is a collection of varicose veins within the pampiniform (spermatic) plexus&#xD;
      secondary to reflux in the internal spermatic vein (ISV).The condition affects 10% to 15% of&#xD;
      the general population but is detected in as many as 40% of men undergoing an infertility&#xD;
      workup. Depending on the method used for diagnosis, varicoceles are reported as bilateral in&#xD;
      17% to 77% of men. Traditionally, the diagnosis was made through clinical examination;&#xD;
      however,as with other venous reflux disorders, ultrasound has become the mainstay of&#xD;
      diagnosis. The traditional indications for treatment include infertility in patients with&#xD;
      appropriate semen abnormalities, chronic groin pain, testicular atrophy in adolescent&#xD;
      varicoceles, and recurrent varicocele after previous repair. Other indications more recently&#xD;
      described with variable strength of evidence include low serum testosterone (with or without&#xD;
      erectile dysfunction), benign prostatic hypertrophy,enhancement of assisted fertility&#xD;
      techniques, and recurrent first trimester pregnancy loss.Infertility affects 10% to 15% of&#xD;
      men of reproductive age. In approximately 50%, a cause is not found. The proof that&#xD;
      varicocele repair improves fertility remains elusive; however, there is general acceptance&#xD;
      that treatment does improve abnormalities of semen production.The traditional measures to&#xD;
      assess semen production are sperm motility,morphology, and total sperm count. However, sperm&#xD;
      counts greatly vary from day to day in any individual patient, and these measures correlate&#xD;
      poorly with infertility outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators do this study to evaluate the effectiveness of endovascular therapy using&#xD;
      coils and other sclerosing agents and compare their results with other traditonal surgical&#xD;
      methods in treatement of varicocele.&#xD;

      All included patients will undergo the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  History &amp; examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Semen analysis preintervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scrotal duplex scan of testicular vessels and testicular size .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All interventions will be performed in the endovascular OR with set on C-ARM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's position and comfort are issues that are important initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEPS FOR SPERMATIC VENOGRAPHY AND VARICOCELE EMBOLIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 1: Vascular Access&#xD;
&#xD;
      Access can be achieved via the internal jugular or femo¬ral veins. Our preferred method is to&#xD;
      puncture the right internal jugular vein under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2: Left Renal Vein Injection&#xD;
&#xD;
      During left renal vein injection, the origin of the left spermatic vein is noted .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 3: Left Spermatic Vein Catheterization&#xD;
&#xD;
      The catheter is manipulated into the left spermatic vein. A varicocele is present if the&#xD;
      contrast refluxes into the pampiniform plexus. If the direction of flow is antegrade, this is&#xD;
      considered to represent a negative spermatic venogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4: Spermatic Vein Occlusion&#xD;
&#xD;
      If varicocele is confirmed, the spermatic vein is occluded, preferably immediately above the&#xD;
      internal inguinal ring and along its full length to within 2 to 3 cm of its origin. The use&#xD;
      of liquid embolics with or without metallic coils has become the most common method.&#xD;
      Embolization with coils alone without liquid should be avoided, even for &quot;straightforward&quot;&#xD;
      cases due to a high rate of recurrence. It is important to look for collaterals throughout&#xD;
      the procedure, which may only become visible after distal occlusion . These collaterals are&#xD;
      the usual cause of technical failure or recurrence and therefore must be occluded. Options&#xD;
      for occlusion methods are described as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some practitioners place coils in the distal ISV before injecting glue. Coils in the proximal&#xD;
      ISV are not necessary. Avoiding injection of glue into the scrotum is essential, either by&#xD;
      previously placed distal coils or external compression. Overinjection of glue will result in&#xD;
      extension into the renal vein or embolization into the pulmonary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5: Right Spermatic Venography&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same steps performed for the left spermatic vein are repeated for the right spermatic&#xD;
      vein, except that the right spermatic vein usually arises directly from the infe¬rior vena&#xD;
      cava. If reflux is demonstrated, embolization is performed in the same manner as on the left.&#xD;
      The right spermatic vein arises from the inferior vena cava at an acute angle, which can make&#xD;
      catheterization from the femoral route especially difficult.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POSTPROCEDURE CARE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is kept in bed for 1 hour postprocedure. The patient is advised to take&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory agents as needed and to avoid any activity involving the Valsalva maneuver,&#xD;
      such as lifting, vigorous, or &quot;hitting type&quot; sports for 3 full days beginning the day after&#xD;
      the proce¬dure. Most patients report a minor dull ache in the back or groin lasting &lt; 2 to 5&#xD;
      days. Fewer than 5% of patients will develop more severe pain lasting up to 14 days,&#xD;
      requiring oral analgesics and anti-inflammatory agents and avoidance of vigorous exercise&#xD;
