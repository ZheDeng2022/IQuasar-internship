      Scientific context&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epstein-Barr virus has a causal role in the pathogenesis of multiple distinct lymphomas.&#xD;
      Post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD) are the most frequent EBV-induced&#xD;
      proliferations. PTLD after allogeneic stem cell transplantation has an incidence lower than&#xD;
      5% but may increase up to 10-20% in patients with established risk factors. EBV-DNAemia is&#xD;
      predictive of EBV-PTLD and is routinely performed using qPCR on whole blood. Preemptive&#xD;
      therapeutic strategies with anti-CD20 antibody are used when patients are above a defined&#xD;
      EBV-DNAemia threshold. This approach remains limited since it does not discriminate between&#xD;
      an EBV-induced lymphoproliferation (latent cycle) and/or a replicating virus (replicative&#xD;
      cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epigenetic modifications plays a central role in regulating the switch from latent to lytic&#xD;
      gene expression. Specific DNA modifications can be regarded as molecular signatures for EBV&#xD;
      genomes associated with the status of the viral infection (latent vs lytic). Accordingly,&#xD;
      these signatures may be envisioned as a potent tool to characterize the state of the viral&#xD;
      infection in vivo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the project Our primary objective is to estimate the respective percentages of&#xD;
      EBV-lytic and EBV-latent genomes (proliferating cells) in patients presenting with a high&#xD;
      EBV-DNAemia after allogeneic stem cell transplantation HSCT by analysing the epigenetic&#xD;
      modifications of EBV genome on specific sites. Our secondary objectives are i) to determine&#xD;
      risk factors associated with each &quot;latent versus lytic EBV&quot; profiles and ii) to correlate the&#xD;
      &quot;latent versus lytic EBV&quot; profiles with response to rituximab infusion and patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this purpose, a retrospective study (n=80) and a prospective study (estimation n=58) will&#xD;
      be established. The different steps of this project are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study epigenetic modifications. The laboratory is developing a new approach to&#xD;
           distinguish between latent and lytic genomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To realize quantitative analysis by RT-PCR of different EBV transcripts specific of the&#xD;
           latent or of the lytic phase of the virus This method will be applied on RNA extracted&#xD;
           from patient blood samples with elevated EBV viral load, under condition preserving RNA&#xD;
           integrity. The results will be validated on a prospective cohort of HSCT patients (n=58)&#xD;
           (Saint-Antoine Hospital and La Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To perform quantitative analysis of EBV genomes in plasma, saliva and total blood&#xD;
           samples by current routine procedures In addition to total blood samples, plasma and&#xD;
           saliva will be collected since free viral particles are known to accumulate in these&#xD;
           biological fluids upon EBV reactivation. These samples will be treated by normalized&#xD;
           procedures that are routinely used in the medical virology laboratory to quantify EBV in&#xD;
           human samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results By establishing a simple method for studying epigenetic modifications of EBV&#xD;
      genomes, we expect to understand the significance of high EBV viral load and the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of post-HSCT PTLD. We aim to distinguish between the latent / lytic profiles&#xD;
      of HSCT patients and to correlate their respective risks for developing PTLD. Establishing&#xD;
      the epigenetic EBV profile in the post-HSCT setting when facing increase viral load and PTLD&#xD;
      will improve our understanding of the biological mechanisms determining EBV-status in&#xD;
      post-HSCT. This should improve major medical and economical issues. These results could have&#xD;
      a major therapeutic&#xD;

      Study duration :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration: 37 months Duration of recruitment: 24 months Duration of participation&#xD;
      for each patient: 13 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospective study: Patient who underwent HSCT, in Saint-Antoine hospital, between&#xD;
      2010-2015, treated by rituximab for high level EBV-DNAemia (above 3.3 log copies/mL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective study: Patients who underwent HSCT, in Saint-Antoine hospital and la&#xD;
      Pitié-Salpêtrière, in 2016-2017, treated by rituximab for high level EBV-DNAemia (above 10&#xD;
      000c/mL), And/or having post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases(PTLD) Concerned&#xD;
      population Allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT) patients with a&#xD;
      high Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) viral load&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint (linked to the primary objective) Respective percentages of latent versus&#xD;
      replicative EBV profiles, defined by the methylation level of specific sites of EBV genome,&#xD;
      in a cohort of HSCT patients with a high EBV viral load (above 3.3 log copies/ml) before the&#xD;
      initiation of treatment per rituximab. A methylation index will be calculated from the&#xD;
      respective differences of the &quot;Cycle thresholds&quot; of the methyl-qPCR performed on patients&#xD;
      blood samples Secondary endpoints (linked to the secondary objectives)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Characteristics of the patients according to the EBV q-PCR results&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients' outcome according to the EBV profile defined by the methyl-qPCR :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Response to Rituximab infusion (EBV DNA-emia &lt; 3.3 log copies/mL) after a maximum&#xD;
                of 4 infusions)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Disease-free survival (DFS) at 12 months defined as survival without relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall survival (OS) at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Relapse incidence (RI) at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Non-relapse mortality (NRM) at 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of post-HSCT infections within 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Comparison between characteristics of latent and lytic genomes will be performed using&#xD;
           parametric (Student t-test) or non-parametric (Mann Whitney test) when appropriate for&#xD;
           continuous variables, Chi-Square test for qualitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Multivariate analysis for determination of risk factors associated with &quot;lytic EBV&quot;&#xD;
           profiles will be performed using logistic regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Correlation between &quot;latent versus lytic EBV&quot; profiles&quot; and response to rituximab&#xD;
           infusion will be performed using logistic regression including in the model all other&#xD;
           factors potentially associated to the response to rituximab. OS and DFS will be&#xD;
           estimated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Cumulative incidences of RI and NRM will be&#xD;
           calculated from the date of inclusion to the date of relapse or death in remission,&#xD;
           respectively, with the other event being the competing risk. Death or progression will&#xD;
           be considered as a competing events for estimating the incidence of acute GVHD.&#xD;
           Multivariate analyses for survival endpoints will be performed using the Cox&#xD;
           proportional hazards model. The type I error rate is fixed at 0.05 for determination of&#xD;
           factors associated with time to event outcomes. All statistical analyses will be&#xD;
           performed with R software packages (R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna,&#xD;
           Austria)&#xD;
