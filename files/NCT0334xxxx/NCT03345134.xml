      PURPOSE: This study is being conducted to test the safety of the study drug Pembrolizumab,&#xD;
      also known as MK-3475, at different dose levels in combination with the current therapy,&#xD;
      (BCG), for superficial upper urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma. We want to find out&#xD;
      what effects, good and/or bad, it has on upper urinary transitional cell carcinoma OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
      To determine the safety of administering MK-3475 at a fixed dose of 200 mg every three weeks&#xD;
      in conjunction with intrapelvic BCG treatment in high risk superficial UUTTCC patients who&#xD;
      are unfit or unwilling to be treated with radical nephroureterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: Open-label, single center, Phase II, treatment trial TREATMENT: BCG- BCG&#xD;
      treatment could be delivered both through a retrograde ureteral catheter placed under&#xD;
      fluoroscopic control or through an antegrade nephrostomy tube placed by interventional&#xD;
      radiology. Treatment will be once a week for 6 weeks. BCG treatment will begin on Day 1 of&#xD;
      Week 7. Depending on patient's response, they may have additional treatments beyond the 6&#xD;
      scheduled, but they will be outside of the patient's participation in this study.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab will be given through an intravenous needle once every 21 days (one cycle) for&#xD;
      a total of 6 cycles. It will take 30 minutes for the infusion of the study drug.&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab will be given on Day 1 of weeks 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, and 16 while BCG will be given&#xD;
      on Day 1 of weeks 7-12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURES: Following informed consent, prescreening and screening procedures will be&#xD;
      performed, which will include medical history review, baseline chest x ray and EKG,&#xD;
      ureteroscopy and pulmonary function tests for final eligibility status. Once subject is&#xD;
      eligible, they will undergo physical exams (every 3 weeks), vital signs and weight (each&#xD;
      study visit), adverse event monitoring (each study visit), ECGs (screening visit), bloodwork&#xD;
      (at screening and then every 3 weeks), urinalysis at selected study visits, and concomitant&#xD;
      medication review (each study visit), and questionnaires (selected study visits). After&#xD;
      subject has completed week 19, they will have a study discontinuation visit, followed by a 30&#xD;
      day follow up visit. The subject will then be followed at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 and 24 months post&#xD;
      treatment where vital status will be determined as well as disease recurrence status.&#xD;
      Ureteroscopy will be performed as standard of care but will be considered measures for&#xD;
      efficacy. Biopsy will be performed as clinically indicated.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Demonstrate adequate organ function, all screening labs should be performed within 28&#xD;
             days of treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subject of childbearing potential should have a negative urine or serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to receiving the first dose of study medication.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential should be willing to use 2 methods of birth&#xD;
             control or abstain from heterosexual activity for the course of the study through 120&#xD;
             days after the last dose of study medication (Reference Section 5.5.2). Subjects of&#xD;
             childbearing potential are those who have not been surgically sterilized or have not&#xD;
             been free from menses for &gt; 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Male subjects should agree to use an adequate method of contraception starting with&#xD;

         11. Patients who received prior systemic chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or&#xD;
             radiation therapy for UUTTCC are allowed into the study as long as there is confirmed&#xD;
             recurrence of the disease after previous treatment and the patient is unwilling or&#xD;

             Tomography [CT] urogram or Magnetic Resonance Imaging [MRI], and urogram are allowed&#xD;
             to ascertain the superficial nature of the disease when indicated, but not required.&#xD;
             If urogram protocol is not available or contrast allergy/poor renal function precludes&#xD;
             such imaging, then non-contrast CT or MRI of the abdomen/pelvis within 90 days of&#xD;
             study entry will suffice.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Has had a prior monoclonal antibody within 4 weeks before study Day 1 or who has not&#xD;
             recovered (i.e., ≤ Grade 1 or at baseline) from adverse events due to agents&#xD;
             administered more than 4 weeks earlier.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has had prior systemic chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy, or radiation&#xD;
             therapy for UUTTCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If subject received major surgery, they must have recovered adequately from the&#xD;
             toxicity and/or complications from the intervention prior to starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has a known additional malignancy that is progressing or requires active treatment.&#xD;
             Exceptions include basal cell carcinoma of the skin, squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
             skin, localized prostate cancer with no recurrence after curative surgery or&#xD;
             radiation, or in situ cervical cancer that has undergone potentially curative therapy.&#xD;
             Lower urinary tract transitional cell carcinoma is also allowable on study as high&#xD;
             risk transitional cell carcinoma is commonly multifocal, and intraluminal BCG therapy&#xD;
             is also used for treatment of lower urinary tract lesions in a manner similar to that&#xD;
             of UUTTCC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Active autoimmune disease that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years&#xD;
             (i.e. with use of disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive&#xD;
             drugs). Replacement therapy (eg. thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid&#xD;
             replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a&#xD;
             form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Has history of (non-infectious) pneumonitis that required steroids, evidence of&#xD;
             interstitial lung disease, or active , non-infectious pneumonitis.&#xD;

             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Has a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality&#xD;
             that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Is pregnant or breastfeeding, or expecting to conceive or father children within the&#xD;
             projected duration of the trial, starting with the pre-screening or screening visit&#xD;
             through 4 months after the last dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Has received prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, anti-PD-L2, anti-CD137, or&#xD;
             anti-Cytotoxic T-lymphocyte-associated antigen-4 (CTLA-4) antibody (including&#xD;
             ipilimumab or any other antibody or drug specifically targeting T-cell co-stimulation&#xD;
             or checkpoint pathways) including anti-CD40 and anti-OX40 antibodies.&#xD;

             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Has known active tuberculosis. Subjects will not be specifically tested for the study;&#xD;
             however, subjects that are tested within 28 days of beginning study or while on study&#xD;
             and test positive with the PPD test before treatment should have active tuberculosis&#xD;
             ruled out before therapy begins for their superficial renal pelvis cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Has received a live vaccine within 30 days prior to the first dose of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Has an active urinary tract infection, gross hematuria, or known broken mucosal&#xD;
             barrier of the renal pelvis.&#xD;
