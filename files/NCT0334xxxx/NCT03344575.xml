  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (VHR) is usually performed by reducing the contents in the&#xD;
      hernia sac from the abdominal cavity and then covering the defect from the inside with a&#xD;
      mesh, i.e. Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh (IPOM). This means that the hernia sac is left in situ&#xD;
      anterior to the mesh. This may, however, predispose for the development of fluid in the&#xD;
      hernia sac, i.e. seroma. The risk of seroma development may be reduced if a the defect is&#xD;
      closed before the mesh is applied. Closing the defect may, however, cause tension and pain&#xD;
      from the abdominal wall. Instead of closing the defect, the part of the peritoneum&#xD;
      constituting the hernia sac may be used for closing the defect. In this case, the peritoneum&#xD;
      is dissected from the edges of the hernia sac and then used as a flap that is fixated to the&#xD;
      edges of the hernia sac on the opposite side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate whether peritoneal bridging reduces the seroma development following&#xD;
      ventral hernia repair, we are undertaking a double-blind randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing conventional closure of the hernia defect with peritoneal bridging. The goal is to&#xD;
      randomize 50 patients undergoing laparoscopic ventral hernia to conventional closure or&#xD;
      closure of the defect with peritoneal bridging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up is performed one month and one year after surgery. At both occasions, the&#xD;
      patient is requested to fill in the Ventral Hernia Pain Questionnaire (VHPQ) and an&#xD;
      investigation is done in order to assess the presence of seromas, recurrences or other local&#xD;
      complications. One year after surgery, computer tomography is performed. The main purpose of&#xD;
      the computer tomography is to quantify the presence of seromas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is intended as phase 2 study with the aim of evaluating peritoneal bridging as an&#xD;
      alternative to conventional defect closure. If the study shows that bridging does not lead to&#xD;
      substantial seroma development, future studies with greater statistical power and other&#xD;
      outcome measures will be undertaken.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic ventral hernia repair (VHR) has become a well-established technique during the&#xD;
      last decade. The repair is usually performed by reducing the contents in the hernia sac from&#xD;
      the abdominal cavity and then covering the defect from the inside with a mesh, i.e.&#xD;
      Intraperitoneal Onlay Mesh (IPOM). This means that the hernia sac is left in situ anterior to&#xD;
      the mesh. This may, however, predispose for the development of fluid in the hernia sac, i.e.&#xD;
      seroma. Even if the mesh prevents the intestines from protruding into the hernia sac, the&#xD;
      patient may still be troubled by discomfort from the seroma that replaces the hernia..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk of seroma development may be reduced if a the defect is closed before the mesh is&#xD;
      applied (IPOM-Plus). Closing the defect may, however, cause tension and pain from the&#xD;
      abdominal wall. Instead of closing the defect, the part of the peritoneum constituting the&#xD;
      hernia sac may be used for closing the defect. In this case, the peritoneum is dissected from&#xD;
      the edges of the hernia sac and then used as a flap that is fixated to the edges of the&#xD;
      hernia sac on the opposite side. This reduces the size of the pseudosac and the peritoneal&#xD;
      surface, which prevents transudation to the pseudosac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate whether peritoneal bridging reduces the seroma development following&#xD;
      ventral hernia repair, we are undertaking a randomized controlled trial. Our goal is to&#xD;
      include 50 patients in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining written and oral consent from the patient, the randomisation is performed&#xD;
      through a sealed envelope system. The patient is blinded to the allocation. Prior to the&#xD;
      procedure, the patient is also requested to fill in the Ventral Hernia Pain Questionnaire&#xD;
      (VHPQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is started according to the usual routines. Adhesions covering the defect are&#xD;
      dissected in order to visualize the defect. If the patients has been randomized to defect&#xD;
      closure, it is sutured with continuous PDS 2-0. . In case the patient is allocated to&#xD;
      peritoneal bridging, the peritoneum is dissected beginning 2-3 cm from the edge of the&#xD;
      defect. The sac is disected all the way to the opposite edge of the defect. The peritoneal&#xD;
      flap is pulled to the opposite side and fixated with Optifix. One of the aims of the bridging&#xD;
      is to to close the defect and increase the surface of contact between the mesh and the&#xD;
      peritoneum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mesh is attached in the same, irrespective of randomization. Optifix with double-crown&#xD;
      technique is used in both groups. Operation time and intraoperative complications are&#xD;
      registered when the procedure is completed. From the day of the procedure until two days&#xD;
      postoperatively, pain from the area of surgery is registered daily on a VAS-scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is invited to clinical follow-up one month and one year after surgery. At both&#xD;
      occasions the patient is requested to fill in VHPQ. One year after surgery, a computer&#xD;
      tomography while straining in order to detect protrusion of the abdominal contents in the&#xD;
      defect. Any protrusion seen at the computer tomography is graded according to a previously&#xD;
      validated classification. The presence of seromas detected at the computer tomography is&#xD;
      described according to Morales-Conde,&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer tomography images are assessed by two radiologists in order to reach consensus.&#xD;
      The presence of seroma anterior to the defect is evaluated in terms of size (maximal&#xD;
      diameter), localization, shape (round, oval, triangular), mean density (Hounsfield unit, HU)&#xD;
      and the volume through three-dimensional reconstructions.&#xD;
