  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to compare high versus low frequency rTMS on motor dysfunction in PD.&#xD;
      Forty patients with PD participated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were randomly assigned into two groups; the first group received 1Hz and the 2nd&#xD;
      one received 20 Hz rTMS daily for 10 days 5 sessions every week. The doctors who assess the&#xD;
      patients clinically is blind for the frequency of rTMS, also patients don't know which type&#xD;
      of stimulation they received. The patients were followed up before and after the 10 sessions&#xD;
      and one month later.&#xD;
