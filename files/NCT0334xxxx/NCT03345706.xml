  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a pilot, open-label study to investigate the feasibility and safety&#xD;
      of selective cerebral hypothermia in OHCA patients receiving ECPR.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with OHCA and meeting the criteria for initiating extracorporeal membrane&#xD;
      oxygenation (ECMO) criteria will be checked for eligibility for the study during CPR by the&#xD;
      emergency physicians or staff at the scene. Informed consent will be asked as well. The&#xD;
      standard V-A circuit for ECMO will be applied to the patients as soon as they arriving ER&#xD;
      following the standard operation procedure of the hospital. The necessary testing and&#xD;
      procedures will be applied to check the eligibility of the patients. Eligible subjects and/or&#xD;
      their legal representatives will be further confirmed for the consent of experimental&#xD;
      selective cerebral hypothermia. Systemic hypothermia at 33.5+/-0.5°C (33-34°C) for 48 hours&#xD;
      will be performed to all eligible subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who consent to receive selective cerebral hypothermia, they will be transferred&#xD;
      to the catheterization lab for the blood flow controlling and cooling system settlement.&#xD;
      Subjects then will be transferred to ICU for the 12-hour selective cerebral hypothermia&#xD;
      procedure. Cooling will be initiated and targeted to reach ipsilateral nasal temperature of&#xD;
      27+/-2°C for 12 hours, followed by controlled rewarming. Both ipsilateral and contralateral&#xD;
      nasal temperature will be monitored throughout. Activated clotting time (ACT) monitoring&#xD;
      should be performed every 2 hours till stable and then every 12 hours during the whole&#xD;
      cooling procedure. Also, subjects will receive systemic hypothermia via ECMO at 33.5+/-0.5°C&#xD;
      (33-34°C) for 48 hours at the same time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will stay and be observed in ICU until subject's condition is stable and can be&#xD;
      transferred to general ward by investigator's judgment. The weaning of ECMO will be judged by&#xD;
      investigator based on the subject's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who do not agree to receive selective cerebral hypothermia, only the systemic&#xD;
      hypothermia via ECMO will be applied. Subjects will receive systemic hypothermia at&#xD;
      33.5+/-0.5°C (33-34°C) for 48 hours via ECMO following the standard operative procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject weaned from ECMO will be transferred to ward and will be followed until 6 months&#xD;
      after the event. Outcome improvement and safety will be evaluated following scheduled&#xD;
      timeline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intends to enroll 20 subjects and is expected that 10 among the 20 enrolled&#xD;
      subjects will receive selective cerebral hypothermia. The data from subjects who do not&#xD;
      receive the experimental procedure will be used as the control group when data analyzing for&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of selective cerebral hypothermia.&#xD;
