  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the phase I/II clinical study is to determine the best dose of fractionated&#xD;
      stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) given either with Avasopasem (GC4419) or placebo to&#xD;
      patients who have been diagnosed with locally advanced pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a parallel arm adaptive design phase I-II dose-finding study to determine the optimal&#xD;
      dose of fractionated stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT), given either with the&#xD;
      radiomodulating agent Avasopasem (GC4419) or placebo for treatment of locally advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. Dose-finding will be done using the sequentially adaptive phase I-II Late&#xD;
      onset Efficacy-Toxicity (LO-ET) trade-off-based design [1-3].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 48 patients will be randomized 1:1 to Arm A or Arm B. Patients in Arm A will&#xD;
      receive Avasopasem (GC4419) in combination with their assigned SBRT dose, and patients in Arm&#xD;
      B will receive Placebo (PBO) with their assigned SBRT dose. The randomization will be&#xD;
      restricted so that the sample size within each arm is exactly 24 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GC4419/placebo will be given intravenously in a one hour infusion. SBRT must be initiated as&#xD;
      soon as possible upon completion of the GC4419/placebo infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GC4419/placebo will be given beginning on the first day of radiation and continuing daily,&#xD;
      concurrent M-F throughout the administration of SBRT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To determine the Maximum Tolerated Dose (MTD) of Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT)&#xD;
      when given in combination with placebo or GC4419&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate Progression-free survival (PFS) at MTD for patients treated with SBRT given&#xD;
           in combination with placebo or GC4419&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate Overall Response Rate (ORR) including stable disease, partial/ complete&#xD;
           response for patients treated with SBRT given in combination with placebo or GC4419&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate late (12 month) toxicity of SBRT in combination with placebo or GC4419&#xD;
