  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cushing's disease is characterized by the existence of a benign pituitary tumor developed&#xD;
      from corticotropic cells responsible for excessive ACTH secretion. This results in&#xD;
      hypercorticism causing high morbidity and mortality and severely impairing quality of life.&#xD;
      The etiological diagnosis is based on Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). However, pituitary&#xD;
      MRI revealed a pituitary tumor in only 60% of patients. The diagnostic procedure is&#xD;
      complicated by the existence of extra pituitary tumors responsible for ACTH ectopic&#xD;
      secretion. This rare etiology imposes, in the absence of typical pituitary image, the&#xD;
      realization of catheterization of the lower petrosal sinuses. Treatment of Cushing's disease&#xD;
      is based on transsphenoidal surgical management, even in the absence of a formal MRI image,&#xD;
      if pituitary origin is confirmed by the catheterization. Although pituitary surgery without&#xD;
      identified target is part of French recommendations, this surgery is associated with a high&#xD;
      risk of failure and morbidity. Optimization of the management of patients' with Cushing's&#xD;
      disease thus requires the improvement of the diagnostic methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis of our study is that [11C] MET MRI-PET may be performed as a first-line MRI for&#xD;
      suspected Cushing's disease and may limit indications for catheterization of lower petrosal&#xD;
      sinuses. Its localizing value should also make it possible to improve the surgical results&#xD;
      with a better identification of the adenoma&#xD;
