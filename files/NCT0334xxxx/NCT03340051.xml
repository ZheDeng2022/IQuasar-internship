  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nearly 18% of United States adults meet criteria for alcohol dependence sometime in their&#xD;
      lifetime, with only 24% of those individuals ever receiving any treatment for their disorder&#xD;
      (Hasin et al., 2007). The pervasiveness of alcohol dependence indicates a need for continued&#xD;
      development of high-impact treatments that are both effective and easily disseminated to a&#xD;
      broad population. Recent evidence indicates that Episodic Future Thinking (EFT), the ability&#xD;
      to self-project and pre-experience a future event, can help individuals to make changes to&#xD;
      habitual behaviors, such as alcohol drinking (Snider et al., 2016). In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will evaluate the efficacy of EFT to help individuals reduce alcohol&#xD;
      consumption. The investigators anticipate that EFT will result in a reduction in alcohol&#xD;
      consumption over a 2-week experimental period when compared to the control group.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After the initial consent and assessment sessions, participants will be asked to provide&#xD;
      daily self-report assessments of previous-day drinking over cell phone for 7 days with no&#xD;
      other study intervention taking place. The purpose for this baseline period is to quantify&#xD;
      baseline drinking patterns and ensure that the participant reliably responds to and conveys&#xD;
      study information via cell phone. At the end of this baseline period, participants who&#xD;
      indicated adaquate patterns of drinking and successfully reported their level of drinking&#xD;
      will be invited to continue in the study. Participants will return to the laboratory to be&#xD;
      provided with a SOBERLINK breathalyzer and be given instruction in its use. The SOBERLINK&#xD;
      device will automatically upload breathalyzer results, the participant's location, and the&#xD;
      picture of the user to a centralized, secure website where the data will be available to&#xD;
      research staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be counterbalanced to either the active or control group based on alcohol&#xD;
      use (e.g., average drinks per day). Both groups will be exposed to the same treatment events.&#xD;
      The intervention period will last for 14 consecutive days, with three breathalyzer screens&#xD;
      per day. During this 14-day period as they did during the baseline period, participants will&#xD;
      self-report their previous-day alcohol use daily with a text message and/or phone call.&#xD;
      Assessment sessions will be conducted prior to the intervention, immediately following the&#xD;
      intervention, and at a 1-month follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will either be allowed to use their own personal cell phone for study&#xD;
      communications or receive a prepaid cell phone with service through a nationwide cell phone&#xD;
      service provider. The study-provided phones include usage controls, allowing us to restrict&#xD;
      phone communication to a study phone and 911 service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the intervention phase of the experiment, participants will be required to submit&#xD;
      three daily breathalyzer assessments at the predetermined times. They will be reminded via&#xD;
      text message when a sample is to be collected, and samples will be accepted up to 15 minutes&#xD;
      before the scheduled time and 30-60 minutes after the scheduled time, giving the participant&#xD;
      45-75 minutes total to submit the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to either the active Episodic Future Thinking (EFT) condition&#xD;
      or the control Episodic Recent Thinking (ERT) condition. EFT participants will generate&#xD;
      positive future events they are looking forward to and that could happen at different future&#xD;
      time points (e.g., in 2 weeks, 1 month, 6 months, 1 year) and participants in the ERT&#xD;
      condition will list positive recent events (events that have already happened) that they&#xD;
      enjoyed that occurred at different past time points (e.g., 12 hours ago, 24 hours ago,1 week&#xD;
      ago). Participants will be instructed to use and think about their episodic cues as they make&#xD;
      decisions. All participants will be provided with a copy of their episodic cues to take home&#xD;
      with them and will receive periodic text messages from research staff to remind them of their&#xD;
      cues. In addition, each day, participants will be asked to report how many alcoholic drinks&#xD;
      they consumed the previous day (from the time they awoke to the time they fell asleep).&#xD;
      Participants will be allowed to report this information via text message or phone call.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a reminder to report their previous-day drinking with text&#xD;
      messages, followed by a phone call if they haven't contacted us by early evening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment sessions will be completed before the 14-day intervention period, immediately&#xD;
      after the 14-day intervention period, and at a 1-month follow-up. Participants will complete&#xD;
      a battery of questionnaires and tasks grouped into three general categories: measures of&#xD;
      substance use (including a urine test for drug use and a breath sample to test for recent&#xD;
      alcohol use), clinically relevant measures including treatment acceptability, and measures of&#xD;
      alcohol value and sensitivity.&#xD;
