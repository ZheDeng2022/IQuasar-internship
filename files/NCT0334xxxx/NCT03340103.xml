  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Premature birth is the most common cause of mortality, morbidity and disability. Premature&#xD;
      infants have a higher risk of developing damage in the eyes (retinopathy of prematurity ROP),&#xD;
      in the central nervous system (intraventricular hemorrhage IVH), in the lungs (bronchial&#xD;
      pulmonary dysplasia BPD), in the gut (NEC) and infections. Oxidative stress has been&#xD;
      implicated in various capacities, in the etiology of these conditions. Lutein and Zeaxanthin&#xD;
      are powerful anti-oxidants and commonly assimilated with different foods. Lutein and&#xD;
      Zeaxanthin are present at level of umbilical cord, in the breast milk (particularly in&#xD;
      colostrum) and pass the placental barrier. Concerning supplementations, the lutein presents,&#xD;
      for its specific characteristics, a high bioavailability after oral administration. In the&#xD;
      last few years, there have been more and more studies which have shown that lutein could&#xD;
      constitute a valid and important preventive and protective factor against certain diseases&#xD;
      related to oxidative stress. The preparations of lutein and zeaxanthin have never pointed out&#xD;
      in the human being (included in the term newborn) adverse or toxic effects. This spontaneous&#xD;
      / non-commercial pilot study involves the administration of a dietary supplement containing&#xD;
      lutein / zeaxanthin, because the healthcare structures need to identify a natural antioxidant&#xD;
      product that can reduce the incidence of serious diseases related to oxidative stress in the&#xD;
      perinatal period. This study aims to evaluate if the administration of lutein in watery&#xD;
      solution will reduce the rate of free radicals in preterm infants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lutein is the most important carotenoid present selectively in certain tissues of the human&#xD;
      body, mainly at the level of the retina, macula (hence the name) and lens. In tissues and&#xD;
      serum, lutein is found together with a carotenoid dihydroxide, its isomer, zeaxanthin. Lutein&#xD;
      and zeaxanthin are present at the level of the umbilical cord and pass through the placental&#xD;
      barrier and are also present in the plasmatic ones, in breast milk and especially in the&#xD;
      colostrum. Concerning the way of administrating, the lutein presents, through its specific&#xD;
      characteristics, an elevated bioavailability after oral administration. The hematic levels of&#xD;
      lutein, after providing nutriments rich in carotenoids, are increased with 67% from the 14%&#xD;
      observed at beta-carotene. Through interdisciplinary and coordinated studies, performed both&#xD;
      in vitro and in vivo, there were identified different action mechanisms; particularly,&#xD;
      investigators have demonstrated a defense mechanism of the tissue function by lutein, which&#xD;
      is produced through the neutralization (quench) phenomenon of the singlet oxygen and reactive&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS). This action provides molecules with different activities: an&#xD;
      antioxidant function, anti-inflammatory properties, properties which promote anti-tumoral&#xD;
      effects, induction of detoxification enzymes and positive effect on proteins promoting the&#xD;
      communication between joints (up-regulation). Recently, there have appeared experimental and&#xD;
      chemical data proving that the oxidative stress and harmful actions determined by ROS can&#xD;
      play an important role in the pathogenesis of many neurological diseases as Alzheimer,&#xD;
      Parkinson in adult and ROP and NEC in newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is due to the fact that the nervous system is characterized by membranes rich in&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fats, the first cellular compounds affected by ROS attack through the lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation. A similar mechanism can appear to certain ocular tissues (macula, lens, retina)&#xD;
      which, containing high amounts of polyunsaturated fat acids, are more vulnerable than other&#xD;
      structures with oxidative degradations induced by ROS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the fact that carotenoids are amongst the most powerful antioxidants existing in&#xD;
      nature, there are being developed new researches concerning the functional role of these&#xD;
      substances in preventing neurodegenerative diseases in newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because these polyunsaturated fat acids are very sensitive to oxidation, the modification of&#xD;
      their plasmatic levels influences the state of the antioxidant systems on the mother and&#xD;
      subsequently to the foetus. Many studies have proved that the increase of the susceptibility&#xD;
      to the peroxidation of polyunsaturated fat acids on pregnant women is accompanied by an&#xD;
      equivalent increase of the tocopherol plasmatic concentration which, immediately after birth,&#xD;
      decrease sharply.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The plasmatic concentrations of the newborns' antioxidants were lower than those of the&#xD;
      mothers. In the umbilical cord, the levels of tocopherols and carotenoids are significantly&#xD;
      lower than the ones registered in the maternal plasma and the concentration of&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fat acids on the newborn is significantly higher and a lot more increased&#xD;
      than on the mother.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, specific studies showed a growing interest towards the oxidative stress and&#xD;
      oxygen reactive species which supposedly accumulate after birth. Many practices usually used&#xD;
      in the delivery room (for example the drugs given to pregnant woman to ease her pain, the&#xD;
      newborns' extraction methods, the techniques to minimize body temperature decrease, blocking&#xD;
      the umbilical cord and especially the use of oxygen to 100 % or a ventilated room for&#xD;
      newborns presenting asphyxia signs) do not always prove to be efficient and can also&#xD;
      compromise the health of the newborn because of a significant increase of free radicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some specific studies have compared the levels of free radicals, highlighted with markers, in&#xD;
      the plasma of the umbilical cord of newborns with asphyxia treated 100% with oxygen or 21%&#xD;
      with oxygen, comparative to a control group of children without asphyxia. The levels of free&#xD;
      radicals were significantly increased immediately after birth in all three groups and grew in&#xD;
      the two groups of newborns with asphyxia. In the group treated 21% with oxygen, these values&#xD;
      decreased and have reached the same level of the newborns without asphyxia at 28 days after&#xD;
      birth, whereas at the group treated 100% with oxygen the levels of free radicals remained&#xD;
      very high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, a short exposure of the newborn to 100% oxygen is the cause of an extended oxidative&#xD;
      stress state and a consistent increase of free radicals, which seem to be involved in&#xD;
      different diseases and pathologies during the first months of life, especially in the preterm&#xD;
      infant increasing significantly the incidence of ROP, IVH, BPD, NEC and infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These results show that the newborn need to increase the level of antioxidant protection to&#xD;
      establish the redox balance and to prevent the problems occurred from an extended exposure to&#xD;
      high levels of free radicals and oxygen reactive species.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The premature birth is the most frequent cause of mortality, morbidity and disability.&#xD;
      Premature babies have an extremely high risk to develop ocular or neurological lesions. The&#xD;
      main complication at visual level that may appear is called retinopathy of prematurity, so&#xD;
      called ROP. Oxidative stress is involved in the etiology of this disease. In fact, premature&#xD;
      babies, because of respiratory issues, are often exposed to potentially damaging oxygen&#xD;
      concentrations or to phototherapy with high blue light intensity. These therapeutic practices&#xD;
      are sources of free radicals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies performed on the babies showed that the levels of carotenoids in the first four /&#xD;
      six months of life are much reduced. This is due to the fact that the baby's diet is based&#xD;
      exclusively on milk, without any solid elements (as vegetables or green leaves), sole sources&#xD;
      of this nutrient. Nevertheless, breastfed babies, in average, present high plasmatic lutein&#xD;
      levels than babies fed with prepared milk. Different milk formulas for newborns found at&#xD;
      present time on the market are not enriched with this type of carotenoids, thus their content&#xD;
      of lutein and zeaxanthin is very low, except certain formulas which are not traded in Italy&#xD;
      and prepared using egg mixes. Breast milk, is thus the only source of lutein for the newborn&#xD;
      before weaning, and breast feeding proves to be of considerable importance as primary source&#xD;
      of these micronutrients for the newborn, proper development and visual function protection.&#xD;
      Taking into consideration the correlation between the lutein in the blood and breast milk and&#xD;
      the reduction of its levels, similar to all carotenoids, in milk, after 6 days from birth,&#xD;
      there is already an important contribution of nutriments high in lutein during breast&#xD;
      feeding. Such diet enriched in lutein is particularly important especially for the mothers of&#xD;
      premature babies or babies having a small body weight when born. In fact, premature babies&#xD;
      and underweight babies need more nutritive essential substances for a fast grow. These babies&#xD;
      have not benefit from the contribution of highly nutritive and energetic substances&#xD;
      transferred from their mothers during the last weeks of pregnancy. Also, the gastrointestinal&#xD;
      and renal functions which are not completely developed reduce the absorption and withhold of&#xD;
      important micronutrients, amongst which important antioxidants that protect the newborn from&#xD;
      the exposure to high level of free radicals produced excessively at birth and several times&#xD;
      as a result of the resuscitation techniques used. Breast feeding is important for the&#xD;
      antioxidant contribution to the protection of the newborn and the nutritional state of the&#xD;
      mother has subsequently an essential part because it influences the nutrition of the newborn,&#xD;
      especially concerning certain solvable nutritive elements, such as lutein and zeaxanthin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature are already present researches and results with the use of lutein /&#xD;
      zeaxanthin in the newborn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent Gong's work has evaluated the role of lutein / zeaxanthin comparing the data&#xD;
      obtained from various studies, including those of Romagnoli, Dani and Manzoni. Furthermore,&#xD;
      thanks to RCT analysis of Rubin on the subject, investigators concluded that lutein /&#xD;
      zeaxanthin is well tolerated and well absorbed from preterm infants also after oral&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extremely interesting result that has emerged although not statistically significant&#xD;
      (probably due to the small sample) is that supplementation with lutein / zeaxanthin reduced&#xD;
      the incidence and severity of ROP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is born from the idea that given the interesting results of earlier work is&#xD;
      considered important to deepen a dosage of at least 1 ml / kg equal to 0,5 mg of lutein and&#xD;
      0.05 mg of zeaxanthin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluation of the key markers for oxidative stress is necessary along with the study of&#xD;
      the biological antioxidant potential (BPT) and total hydroperoxide (TH) during and after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Already in a previous work, S. Perrone and M. Longini have demonstrated a reduction of the&#xD;
      free radicals in term infants, during and after administration of lutein / zeaxanthin by&#xD;
      determination of the BTP and TH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparations based on lutein and zeaxanthin have never revealed on humans negative or harmful&#xD;
      effects after administration, or to the gastrointestinal or systemic level. In recent studies&#xD;
      there were not reported adverse phenomena after administrating 20 mg/day of lutein or&#xD;
      zeaxanthin for a period of 6 months, or interactions with other liposoluble nutritive&#xD;
      elements.&#xD;
