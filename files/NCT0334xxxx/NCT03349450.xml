      This is a Phase 2 non-randomized, open label, uncontrolled, efficacy and safety study. Study&#xD;
      participants will receive two priming doses of 0.5mL of DPX-Survivac 21 days apart and up to&#xD;
      six 0.1ml maintenance injections every two months with low dose metronomic oral&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide (50 mg BID) for one year or until disease progression, whichever occurs&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab 200 mg will be administered every 3 weeks for up to one year or until disease&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, non-randomized, open-label, uncontrolled, efficacy and safety trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive 2 priming injections (0.5ml) of DPX-Survivac 3 weeks apart on Study&#xD;
      Days 7 and 28. In addition, up to 6 maintenance injections (0.1ml) over the course of the&#xD;
      study occurring on Study Days 84, 140, 196, 252, 308, and 364. All injections will be given&#xD;
      under the skin of the upper thigh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive metronomic oral cyclophosphamide (50mg BID; 7 days on / 7 days off)&#xD;
      for study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab 200mg will be administered intravenously every 3 weeks, commencing on study day&#xD;
      7, to a total of 18 infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a participant is removed from the trial prior to the completion of at least 4 doses of&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab and 3 injections of DPX-Survivac, that particiapnt may be replaced to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy of treatment in a minimum of 16 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DPX-Survivac injection sites will be evaluated throughout the study and if evidence of&#xD;
      significant reaction, an Injection site reaction biopsy will be sought.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the course of the study, blood will be drawn to evaluate immune cells and the effect&#xD;
      that DPX Survivac will have on the participants immune system. During all treatment cycles a&#xD;
      physical exam and questions about the participants general health will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo &quot;re-staging&quot; to assess the status of their disease at approximately&#xD;
      study day 70 (if there is evidence of Grade 2 or greater injection site reaction or&#xD;
      ulceration evident on study day 49) or routinely at approximately study day 91, and again at&#xD;
      end of study or study withdrawal for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up tumour biopsy will be requested between study day 77-83 for participants with any&#xD;
      grade 2 or greater Injection site reaction or ulceration on SD49 or between SD98 and SD104 if&#xD;
      no evidence of injection site reaction or ulceration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon completion of study, participants will be monitored every 2 months for 1 year.&#xD;

         25. Serious intercurrent chronic or acute illness, such as cardiac disease (New York Heart&#xD;
             Association class III or IV), hepatic disease, or other illness considered by the&#xD;
             investigator as an unwarranted high risk for an investigational product.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Allergies to any vaccine, that after discussion with the medical monitor are serious&#xD;
             enough to warrant exclusion from this study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu vaccines and are&#xD;
             allowed; however, intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated&#xD;
             vaccines, and are not allowed&#xD;
