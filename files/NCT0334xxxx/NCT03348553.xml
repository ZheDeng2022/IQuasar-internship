      In this randomized, controlled clinical study firstly the bioavailability of fatty acids and&#xD;
      micronutrients of JP+Omega Blend will be analysed. Secondly, the effect of the constituents&#xD;
      contained in the nutraceuticals on blood lipid values will be determined. Thirdly, it will be&#xD;
      examined, whether a dose-dependent effect of the supplementation of JP+ Omega Blend exists.&#xD;
      Fourthly, the effect of a combined consumption of JP+ Omega Blend and Juice Plus+® Orchard,&#xD;
      Garden and Vineyard blend (JP+ OGV) is investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH QUESTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To which extend will the ω-3-fatty acids, as well as certain micronutrients, such as&#xD;
           carotenoids and tocopherols contained in the herbal fatty acid nutraceutical JP+® Omega&#xD;
           Blend be resorbed?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are the ω-3 fatty acids bioavailable by increasing ω-3-index?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does a 4-month long supplementation with a plant-based herbal fatty acid nutraceutical&#xD;
           (JP+ Omega Blend) exert a positive effect on lipid metabolism in subjects with&#xD;
           suboptimal serum-lipid values?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does a dose-dependent effect on lipid profile exist in the subjects through&#xD;
           supplementation of JP+ Omega Blend?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the supply of JP+ Omega Blend combined with JP+® OGV exert different or additional&#xD;
           effects on bioavailability and lipid metabolism in subjects with suboptimal serum-lipid&#xD;
           values?&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We hypothesise that the ω-3-fatty acids of JP+ Omega Blend will be absorbed in&#xD;
           significant amounts in a dose-dependent manner and have a good bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We pursue the hypothesis, that the supplementation of JP+Omega Blend - at different&#xD;
           dosage or combined with the consumption of JP+ OGV - will cause a positive effect on&#xD;
           lipid metabolism in subjects with suboptimal serum-lipid values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Additionally, we hypothesise that carotenoids and tocopherols (=&quot;micronutrients&quot;)&#xD;
           contained in Juice Plus+Omega Blend will be absorbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The &quot;null-hypotheses&quot; are in detail:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ω-3-fatty acids, contained in JP+Omega Blend, are not significantly absorbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The ω-3-fatty acids, contained in JP+Omega Blend, show no bioavailability or no increase&#xD;
           in erythrocyte ω-3-index, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The supplementation of JP+ Omega Blend in different dosages and combined with the&#xD;
           supplementation of JP+ OGV has no (additional) effect on lipid profile and /or&#xD;
           metabolism in subjects with suboptimal serum lipid values.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The carotenoids and tocopherols contained in JP+®Omega Blend are not absorbed to a&#xD;
           significant extent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Primary endpoint: Ω-3-index = bioavailability of ω-3-fatty acids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary endpoint: lipid profile&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tertiary endpoint: absorption of micronutrients&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomised, controlled, clinical study evaluates:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The bioavailability of omega-3 fatty acids of a herbal fatty acid nutraceutical (JP+®&#xD;
           Omega Blend) after two and four months supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The effects of a 4-month long supplementation period of JP Omega-Blend in different&#xD;
           dosages or combined with a fruit, vegetable and berry juice concentrate (JP+® selection&#xD;
           of fruit, vegetables, and berries) on bioavailability and lipid metabolism in subjects&#xD;
           with suboptimal serum lipid values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           MERITS&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The data acquired within this project will provide scientifically sound information&#xD;
           about absorption and bioavailability of ω-3-fatty acids contained in the herbal&#xD;
           nutraceutical Juice Plus+ Omega Blend.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The results of this project will provide information about the effect of the&#xD;
           supplementation of a purely herbal fatty acid product on lipid metabolism in subjects&#xD;
           with suboptimal serum lipid values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Data of this study will provide information about a possible dose-dependent effect of&#xD;
           JP+Omega Blend supplementation and an effect of the combined supplementation of JP+Omega&#xD;
           Blend and JP+ OGV on lipid metabolism and micronutrient absorption in subjects with&#xD;
           suboptimal serum lipid values.&#xD;
&#xD;
           METHODS/STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Study design: This clinical study is a randomized, controlled study with a&#xD;
           parallel-group design.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The recruitment phase of the study starts with initial telephone interviews of potential&#xD;
           subjects about inclusion and exclusion criteria for pre-selection. Special focus will&#xD;
           lie on the determination of any intake of nutritional supplements including&#xD;
           antioxidants, supplements with relevant effects on redox biology, omega-3 fatty acids&#xD;
           and various plant extracts and concentrates. If a supplementation with the just&#xD;
           mentioned substances is conducted, a wash-out phase of at least 4 weeks has to be&#xD;
           implemented before the pre-screening period. The pre-screening aims to further evaluate&#xD;
           inclusion and exclusion criteria of the subjects and also focuses on the measurement of&#xD;
           ω-3 indices and blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           If inclusion criteria are met and written informed consent is given, subjects are&#xD;
           randomised into one of 4 intervention groups (control group (CG; consumption of 2&#xD;
           capsules of JP+ Omega Blend/d (Ω2); consumption of 4 capsules JP+ Omega Blend/d (Ω4);&#xD;
           consumption of 2 capsules JP+ Omega Blend + Juice Plus+ Obst-, Gemüse- und&#xD;
           Beerensaftkonzentrat with 2 capsules each /d (Ω2+OGV)). Subjects allocated to Ω2 and Ω4&#xD;
           will receive the herbal fatty acid nutraceutical in the 4-month long study period&#xD;
           (intervention phase), subjects allocated to Ω2+OGV will additionally receive the fruit,&#xD;
           vegetable and berry juice concentrate. The control group will refrain from using any&#xD;
           supplements over the course of this period and will maintain their usual eating habits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects are asked to complete an at least 4-week long wash-out phase, before attending&#xD;
           the baseline-visit. The consumption of foods, as well as medication and supplements,&#xD;
           which could influence the study outcome, will be suspended (see section &quot;nutrition&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The measurements and examinations with eligible subjects will be conducted within the&#xD;
           scope of the study visits at baseline, after 2 (midpoint) and after 4 months (end of&#xD;
           study; endpoint).&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Subjects The subjects of this study comprise 80 healthy men and women with suboptimal&#xD;
           serum lipid values (see inclusion criteria).&#xD;
&#xD;
           (NUTRITIVE) INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Supplementation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           A wash-out phase of at least 4 weeks, to eliminate all nutritional supplements taken&#xD;
           prior to study, is followed by a 16 week long intervention phase. During this phase, the&#xD;
           nutraceutical JP+ Omega Blend alone or in combination with an encapsulated fruit,&#xD;
           vegetable and berry-juice concentrate (JP+Orchard, Garden and Vineyard blend; JP+OGV)&#xD;
           will be supplemented. Participants allocated to the Ω2 group receive 2 capsules of JP+&#xD;
           Omega Blend/d, one capsule to be taken in the morning and one in the evening together&#xD;
           with a meal. The intake of two capsules per day complies with the directions of use&#xD;
           given on the label of the nutraceutical, which has been available on the market since&#xD;
           2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants in the Ω4 group are instructed to consume 4 capsules of JP+ Omega Blend/d,&#xD;
           two capsules along with the breakfast and two in the evening. In the Ω2+OGV group,&#xD;
           participants receive 2 capsules of JP+® Omega Blend plus 2 capsules each of an&#xD;
           encapsulated fruit, vegetable and berry-juice concentrate (JP+OGV) (total intake of 8&#xD;
           capsules/d; 4 capsules with the breakfast meal and 4 administered with the evening&#xD;
           meal). The control group does not receive any supplementation. However, the subjects in&#xD;
           this group are instructed not to change dietary habits during the 4 month long study&#xD;
           period, similarly to the other intervention groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All participants will be provided with a sufficient amount of supplements, according to&#xD;
           their randomization group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants randomized into Ω2 receive 2 containers (with 60 capsules each) of the&#xD;
           supplement at baseline and another 2 containers at the midpoint visit after 8 weeks. Ω4&#xD;
           participants receive twice the amount of the JP+Omega Blend capsules. Subjects in Ω2+OGV&#xD;
           receive the same amount of JP+ Omega Blend capsules as Ω2 plus 2 containers each&#xD;
           (containing 120 capsules) of JP+fruit, vegetable and berry juice concentrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In total 2 backups will be retained for each intervention group and stored at room&#xD;
           temperature. One full backup remains at the testing facility (Institute for&#xD;
           Pathophysiology and Immunology), the second backup will be stored at Green Beat&#xD;
           (Institute of Nutrient Research and Sport Nutrition). Thus, even in the case of the&#xD;
           cancellation of a study visit (alternative visit scheduled within two weeks; elimination&#xD;
           from the study after a longer period of absence from the visits), capsules should be&#xD;
           available in sufficient amounts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Compliance: All participants will be asked to return the containers with the remaining&#xD;
           capsules at the midpoint and endpoint visit. The capsules will be counted to determine&#xD;
           the compliance of capsule intake.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  Composition of the Juice Plus+ Orchard, Garden and Vineyard blend Juice Plus+® is&#xD;
                an encapsulated, powdered juice concentrate derived from 36 different fruits,&#xD;
                vegetables and berries including juice and pulp from concord grape, blueberry,&#xD;
                cranberry, blackberry, bilberry, raspberry, redcurrant, blackcurrant, elderberry,&#xD;

                OGV, respectively) of the nutraceutical provide 9.5 mg beta-carotene, 214 mg&#xD;
                vitamin C, 60 mg vitamin E, 600 mcg folate and 63 kJ per day (= 6 capsules). The&#xD;
                nutraceutical is distributed by the Juice Plus Company/NSA LLC, Collierville, TN,&#xD;
                USA and manufactured for Europe by Natural Alternitives International (NAI), Manno,&#xD;
                Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Nutrition Subjects are instructed to implement a wash-out phase of any nutritional&#xD;
                supplements and medication recently taken that could influence the outcome&#xD;
                parameters of the study (especially omega-3 fatty acid supplements, plant extracts&#xD;
                and concentrates). This phase should be implemented for at least 4 weeks of&#xD;
                duration and will be standardized for nutrition intake of omega-3 fatty acid rich&#xD;
                foods. Subjects are instructed to limit the intake of fish to maximal 1&#xD;
                portion/week, limit the intake of certain oils and nuts to maximal 1 Tbsp./d of&#xD;
                rapeseed oil and 1 Tsp./d of linseed oil, hempseed oil, walnut oil; maximal 1&#xD;
                portion of nuts and seeds (25g)/d), as well as reduce the consumption if fruits and&#xD;
                vegetables to maximal 3 portions/d (of which 2 portions may be vegetables).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Before each of the fasted blood samples the participant's nutrition will be strictly&#xD;
           standardized. Each of the subjects is instructed to protocol complete nutrition in the&#xD;
           last 3 days before the baseline visit (and blood sample). Those protocols will be&#xD;
           examined by a trained dietician and provide guidance for the participants. By this they&#xD;
           can repeat the protocol and therefore reproduce the same nutritional intake in the days&#xD;
           before the subsequent blood samples both at midpoint and endpoint visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dietary records developed by Green Beat are used, which have already been successfully&#xD;
           established in different scientific studies. Additionally, these protocols collect&#xD;
           information on physical activity, sleeping behaviour, as well as stress and well-being.&#xD;
           All subjects receive a thorough instruction by a dietician on how to fill in the&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Summary of measures to standardize participant's nutrition:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  max. 2 portions of fish/week&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  max. 3 portions of vegetables &amp; fruit /d (of which max. 2 portions can be&#xD;
                vegetables)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  nuts and seeds: max. 1 portion (25g) / d&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  high quality, cold pressed oils: max. 1 Tbsp. rapeseed oil and 1 Tsp. per day of&#xD;
                linseed oil, hempseed oil, walnut oil&#xD;
&#xD;
           EVALUATION/STATISTICS Per protocol analyses will be performed with SPSS for Windows&#xD;
           Software, Version 22.0. Data will be presented as mean ± SD. The randomisation of the&#xD;
           subjects into the intervention groups will be considered during data analysis.&#xD;
           Statistical significance is set at P &lt; 0.05. The Shapiro-Wilk test will be used to&#xD;
           determine normal distribution. Baseline characteristics (weight, age, gender, BMI etc.)&#xD;
           of subjects will be determined by means of descriptive statistics and will be displayed&#xD;
           graphically or in tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Comparison of the mean values of baseline parameters among the 4 intervention groups&#xD;
           will be done by analysis of variance, ANOVA. If data are normally distributed and&#xD;
           variance homogeneity is fulfilled, student's t-test will be the main statistical test&#xD;
           used to compare baseline and endpoint parameters in the respective group or to determine&#xD;
           differences between baseline and midpoint, as well as midpoint and endpoint&#xD;
           measurements. If it is not possible to use metrical data, non-parametric tests will be&#xD;
           used (Wilcoxon rank sum test).&#xD;
&#xD;
           One and two factorial repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) are used to perform&#xD;
           within and between group analysis for the factors &quot;time&quot; and &quot;treatment&quot;, respectively.&#xD;
           If the detected differences between the groups are significant, Tukey's post hoc test&#xD;
           and Bonferroni correction will be used to determine the localization of the differences.&#xD;
           In the case of the use of non-parametrical tests, Friedman Test (within group) and&#xD;
           Kruskal Wallis test (between group) will be used for analysis.&#xD;
