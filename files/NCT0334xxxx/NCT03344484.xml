  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the increasing numbers of patients undergoing fusion procedures for the degenerative&#xD;
      lumbar spine, infection and re-operation can negatively impact outcomes. Numerous&#xD;
      observational and retrospective reviews have shown advantages to para-median versus midline&#xD;
      approaches; however, recent systematic reviews have shown a need for a well-powered,&#xD;
      prospective randomized control trials comparing both exposures. As a step towards a long-term&#xD;
      goal of an RCT to address this issue, the purpose of this pilot study is to gather initial&#xD;
      data to examine whether operative approach impacts the short-term infection rate,&#xD;
      re-operation rate, length of stay, and overall costs to the system. Patients deemed&#xD;
      appropriate surgical candidates with single or two-level degenerative spondylolisthesis will&#xD;
      be approached for participation, and randomized into either the midline or paramedian group.&#xD;
      Initial follow-ups will be at 2 and 6 weeks, and 3 months. Infection rates, inpatient and&#xD;
      outpatient adverse events, re-operation rates, radiation exposure and costs will be&#xD;
      determined. Cost effectiveness analysis will be estimated comparing each procedure using a&#xD;
      bottom-up estimation. Post-operative wound infection can have a significant effect on patient&#xD;
      short and long term outcomes. If a significant difference in infection rate is demonstrated,&#xD;
      as well as lower re-operation rates, shorter stays, and decreased overall costs, adoption of&#xD;
      paramedian approaches to single or two-level fusions of the lumbar spine might be suggested,&#xD;
      providing fuel for a full-scale RCT.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Paramedian lumbar interbody fusion has been hypothesized to be advantageous over midline&#xD;
      approaches for several reasons, the most important of which is lower post-operative infection&#xD;
      rates. To achieve our long-term goal of conducting a RCT to examine this issue in-depth, a&#xD;
      pilot study is initially required to examine if this surgical approach may indeed lower&#xD;
      infection rates and associated health care cost savings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that: (1) there will be a statistically- and clinically-significant&#xD;
      difference in infection rates with each approach to the lumbar spine, with those for the&#xD;
      paramedian approach being lower; and (2) as a result of lower infection and complication&#xD;
      rates, and reduced length of stay, the costs associated with the paramedian approach to the&#xD;
      spine will be substantially less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All consecutive patients deemed appropriate surgical candidates with single or two-level&#xD;
      degenerative spondylolisthesis will be approached for participation and inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be evaluated. (Note: Target enrollments will not be set a priori, but&#xD;
      determined through the course of this proposal.) Once patients are confirmed to be eligible&#xD;
      for the study, baseline patient reported outcome data will be collected (ODI, SF-12, EQ-5D,&#xD;
      PHQ-9 and generic demographic information). Recruits will be randomized into either the&#xD;
      midline or paramedian group using a computer-generated randomization process. After surgery,&#xD;
      the surgeon will complete a post-operative summary, discharge form and adverse events form.&#xD;
      Follow-up appointments at 6 weeks and 3 months will include repeating the patient reported&#xD;
      health outcome questionnaires (ODI, SF-12, EQ-5D, PHQ-D) as well as a cost diary and pain&#xD;
      questionnaire. With the assistance of our institution's Research Methods Unit, data analysis&#xD;
      will be conducted. Continuous variables (length of stay, SF-12, EQ-5D) will be compared using&#xD;
      students T-test while adjusting for potential confounders (diabetes, primary diagnosis, etc)&#xD;
      using multi regression models. Categorical data will be analyzed using Chi-squared analysis&#xD;
      while controlling for confounders using Cox-proportional hazards ratios.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the primary outcomes will be infection rates. To avoid bias in this area, infection&#xD;
      will be tracked using the Center for Disease Control (CDC) criteria for diagnosing both deep&#xD;
      and superficial infections. Deep infections will be diagnosed with deep wound cultures. The&#xD;
      CDC criteria for diagnosing superficial infection is erythema, drainage, dehiscence and&#xD;
      &quot;surgeon opinion&quot;, allowing for significant subjectively in superficial infections. As such,&#xD;
      it is possible that surgeons may preferentially diagnose more midline or Wiltse incisions&#xD;
      with superficial infection depending on whether they may have an inherent favoured approach.&#xD;
      While it is impossible to truly blind surgeons, allied health care personnel who would have&#xD;
      less bias in favour of one approach will assess all wounds. This is in-line with current&#xD;
      practice, as wounds are generally assessed by nurses in the clinic, and staples or sutures&#xD;
      are removed at the two-week follow-up visit. Surgeons are only asked to assess wounds that&#xD;
      are questionable. This would decrease some of the potential bias as part of this un-blinded&#xD;
      study. Surgeon opinion will have no impact on deep infection, because this will generally&#xD;
      require irrigation and debridement in the operating theater which will be captured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits, in the event of a positive study outcome, will lead to substantial improvements&#xD;
      in patient care with reduced infection rates. If the evidence is compelling from a pilot&#xD;
      study, the goal would be to move to a prospective, multi-centered randomized control trial to&#xD;
      further examine this research question and potential adoption of more midline sparing surgery&#xD;
      for fusion procedures of the lumbar spine. In the event that significant cost savings are&#xD;
      demonstrated, quality assurance officers and policy makers would be compelled to adjust&#xD;
      remuneration codes and possibly limit the compensation in cases where a midline approach was&#xD;
      chosen. The cost savings for the system would be substantial even if only a significant&#xD;
      difference in infection rate was demonstrated. There are risks are for lumbar spine surgery&#xD;
      in general. At present, these risks are assumed to be equivalent with the two surgical&#xD;
      approaches to be examined in this study and patients joining in the study can be assured of&#xD;
      high-quality care for their condition regardless of the treatment arm to which they are&#xD;
      allocated. However, if this proposed study can show that infection rates can be lowered with&#xD;
      surgical approach, then the benefits definitely outweigh the risks.&#xD;
