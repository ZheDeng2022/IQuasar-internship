  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Venipuncture (puncturing of a vein) through the skin in order to insert a vein catheter (also&#xD;
      know as cannula) is one of the most common needle-related medical procedures performed in&#xD;
      children. Venipuncture is necessary for administration of sedation to facilitate motionless&#xD;
      patient state for radiological imaging studies such as diagnostic nuclear medicine imaging or&#xD;
      CT scan studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current practice for management of needle-related pain is to use needle-less topical&#xD;
      local anesthetic delivery systems. These delivery systems are increasingly used in children&#xD;
      to anesthetize the skin prior to venipuncture and venous cannulae insertion. This can reduce&#xD;
      the pain and distress associated with the needle sticks, however, many children express&#xD;
      considerable fear, anxiety and distress during medical procedures that involve needles.&#xD;
      Anticipatory pain and phobia associated with needle stick may render the patient&#xD;
      uncooperative and anxious even when effective analgesia is produced by a topical local&#xD;
      anesthetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the discomfort and associated anxiety during such an intervention can be considerably&#xD;
      improved when inhaled nitrous oxide is used alone or in combination with local anesthetics.&#xD;
      The administration of nitrous oxide (50% to 70%) for painful procedures is an effective and&#xD;
      safe method of suppressing procedural pain and distress in children over the age of one year&#xD;
      (level 3 evidence). When compared to other intravenous sedation agents, nitrous oxide 50%&#xD;
      used for uncomplicated painful procedures is associated with markedly shorter recovery time&#xD;
      and less respiratory side effects (level 3 evidence). When combined with local anesthetics&#xD;
      for procedural pain and stress management, nitrous oxide 50% is more effective and has higher&#xD;
      success rate compared to orally administered anxiolytics or local anesthetic alone (level 2&#xD;
      evidence). Combining nitrous oxide (50-70%) and local anesthetics is shown to be a more&#xD;
      effective procedural sedation than local anesthetics alone (level 1 evidence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy and safety of inhaled 50-70% nitrous oxide for relief of mild-to-moderate&#xD;
      anxiety and pain of venipuncture in children just prior to induction of anesthesia have been&#xD;
      investigated in randomized controlled trials by anesthesiologists; physician who are skilled&#xD;
      and competent in providing optimal sedation in the operating room setting. The major benefit&#xD;
      of administration of a fixed low concentration of 50% nitrous oxide for procedural sedation&#xD;
      is that it achieves pain relief while retaining verbal contact with the patient. The&#xD;
      efficacy, safety and tolerability of administration of low fixed concentration 50% nitrous&#xD;
      oxide using a nitrous oxide mask delivery system for control of mild-to-moderate procedural&#xD;
      sedation during performance of needle-related pain (i.e., venipuncture) in children has not&#xD;
      been investigated in a blinded randomized controlled trials outside the operating room&#xD;
      setting when provided by skilled and competent non-anesthesia trained personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of safety of low concentration (50%) of nitrous oxide due to preservation of the&#xD;
      patent airway, lack of respiratory depression and rapid recovery, investigators propose this&#xD;
      preliminary study to validate the hypothesis that nurse-administered premixed inhaled nitrous&#xD;
      oxide and oxygen at a fixed 50:50% concentration with or without a topical anesthetic can&#xD;
      provide safe and effective pain relief and reduce behavioral distress in preschool children&#xD;
      during routine placement of intravenous cannulation prior to administration of intravenous&#xD;
      sedation for nuclear medicine studies and CT imaging studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test this hypothesis, investigators propose performing a prospective, double blind control&#xD;
      trial in 105 children undergoing nuclear medicine studies or CT imaging, randomized into&#xD;
      three groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the treatment groups will receive either nitrous oxide and a placebo topical anesthetic&#xD;
           patch or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nitrous oxide and a topical anesthetic patch (Synera) and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the placebo group will receive oxygen mask and a topical anesthetic patch (Synera).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The topical anesthetic patch or placebo patch will be applied for 20 minutes prior to the&#xD;
      scheduled insertion of intravenous cannula. The use of a topical local anesthetic such as the&#xD;
      Synera patch is a standard of care for placement of intravenous cannula at Children's&#xD;
      Hospital Boston.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments to estimate the effectiveness of nitrous oxide with and without the use of&#xD;
      topical anesthesia Synera patch will include;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assessment of child's pain and observer report of pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Child's anxiety before and during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Tolerability of the mask delivery system of a fixed concentration of 50% nitrous oxide&#xD;
           outside the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Accuracy of nitrous oxide delivery dose by measuring the end-tidal concentration of&#xD;
           nitrous oxide.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Adverse events related to use of nitrous oxide alone or in combination with a topical&#xD;
           analgesic.&#xD;
