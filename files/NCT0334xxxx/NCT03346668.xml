      This study will serve as a pilot study to determine the efficacy and safety of topical&#xD;
      gabapentin in the treatment of symptomatic scarring alopecia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Primary scarring alopecias (PSAs) are poorly understood dermatologic disorders that result in&#xD;
      permanent hair loss. Most of the scarring alopecias involve a painful course, with&#xD;
      individuals reporting scalp pain, burning, itching, or tingling/crawling sensations that can&#xD;
      ultimately impact physical and psychological health. There has been no study of topical&#xD;
      neurogenic agents, such as gabapentin, to treat scarring alopecia. However topical gabapentin&#xD;
      has been safely used in other conditions associated with chronic pain, burning, irritation,&#xD;
      itch, or tingling, such as vulvodynia. This study will serve as a pilot study to determine&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of topical gabapentin in the treatment of symptomatic scarring&#xD;
      alopecia. In this study, 10 subjects with symptomatic lymphocytic-type scarring alopecia will&#xD;
      be recruited and treated with topical gabapentin. Disease burden will be evaluated before and&#xD;
      after 12 weeks of treatment through reporting of subjective symptomatology via&#xD;
      surveys/questionnaire, neurometer study, clinical assessment, and biopsies measuring levels&#xD;
      of CGRP before and after treatment.&#xD;
