    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 474 participants were screened for study eligibility at multiple sites in the United States and Europe. Screen failure was mostly due to inclusion/exclusion criteria not met and &quot;other&quot; reasons. The majority of participants (221/367) were enrolled at study sites in the United States.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 474 participants were screened. 367 participants randomized in 1:1:1 ratio to 1 of 3 treatment groups. 5 randomized participants were not treated (2 in placebo + TCS group &amp; 3 in combined dupilumab + TCS group). Participants randomized to receive Dupilumab 100 mg or 200 mg Q2W + TCS, Dupilumab 300 mg Q4W + TCS or matching placebo.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>The EASI assesses severity and extent of atopic dermatitis. Scores range from 0-72. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness, scratching, and lichenification) are assessed for severity on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). Area of involvement assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, upper limbs and lower limbs and converted to a score of 0 to 6. Higher score indicates increased extent and severity of atopic dermatitis.</description>

          <title>Weekly Average of Daily Worst Itch Score</title>
          <description>The worst itch scale is a simple assessment tool that participants will use to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch). This is an 11-point scale (0 to 10) in which 0 indicates no itching while 10 indicates worst itching possible. Participants will be asked to answer 2 questions daily throughout the entire study (screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period). The daily worst itch score will be calculated as the worse of the scores for the 2 questions.</description>

          <description>POEM is a 7-item, validated questionnaire used to assess disease symptoms in children and adults. The format is a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency of these disease symptoms during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflects disease-related morbidity. A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life.</description>

Nine questions are scored as follows: Very much = 3, Quite a lot = 2, Only a little = 1, Not at all or unanswered = 0. Question 7 has added possible response, which is scored as 3. CDLQI equals the sum of the score of each question (maximum = 30, minimum = 0). Higher the score, the greater the impact on QOL. Data presented reflects the mean &amp; standard deviation of the CDLQI total scores.</description>

          <description>DFI is a 10-item questionnaire with items inquiring about housework, food preparation, sleep, family leisure activity, shopping, expenditure, tiredness, emotional distress, relationships and the impact of helping with treatment on the primary caregiver's life. The DFI questions are scored on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, so that the total DFI score ranges from 0 to 30. Timeframe of reference is the past week. A higher DFI score indicates greater impairment in family QOL as affected by atopic dermatitis.</description>

        <description>The EASI assesses severity and extent of AD. Scores range from 0-72. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness, scratching, and lichenification) were assessed for severity on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). Area of involvement assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6. FAS included all randomized participants.

        <title>Percent Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of Daily Worst Itch Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The worst itch scale was a simple assessment tool that participants used to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch). This was an 11-point scale (0 to 10) in which 0 indicated no itching while 10 indicated worst itching possible. Participants were asked to answer 2 questions daily throughout the entire study (screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period). The daily worst itch score was calculated as the worse of the scores for the 2 questions. The FAS included all randomized participants.

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Improvement (Reduction From Baseline) of Weekly Average of Daily Worst Itch Score ≥4 Points at Week 16</title>
        <description>The worst itch scale was a simple assessment tool that participants used to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch). This was an 11-point scale (0 to 10) in which 0 indicated no itching while 10 indicated worst itching possible. Participants were asked to answer 2 questions daily throughout the entire study (screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period). The daily worst itch score was calculated as the worse of the scores for the 2 questions. The FAS included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized). Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing. Participants with missing score at week 16 were considered as a non-responder. Here &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; = number of participants who were evaluated for this specific endpoint.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving Eczema Area and Severity Index - 90 (EASI - 90) (≥ 90% Improvement From Baseline) at Week 16</title>
          <description>The EASI assessed the severity and extent of atopic dermatitis (AD). Scores range from 0-72. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness, scratching, and lichenification) were assessed for severity on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). Area of involvement assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk, upper limbs, and lower limbs, and converted to a score of 0 to 6. The FAS included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized). Values after first rescue treatment used were set to missing. Participants with missing score at week 16 were considered as a non-responder.</description>

        <title>Time to Achieve ≥ 4 Point Reduction of Weekly Average of Daily Worst Itch Score From Baseline During the 16-week Treatment Period</title>
        <description>The worst itch scale: simple assessment tool that participants used to report intensity of their pruritus (itch). This was an 11-point scale (0 to 10) where 0 (no itching) and 10 (worst itching) possible. Participants were asked to answer 2 questions daily throughout the entire study (screening period, treatment period, &amp; follow-up period). The daily worst itch score was calculated as worse of scores for 2 questions. FAS was used. Time to event is calculated in weeks as (date of first event - date of first dose)/7. The event of NRS reduction ≥ 4 was based on observed data without setting data to be non-responder after rescue treatment use. Here &quot;Number of participants analyzed&quot; = number of participants who were evaluated for this specific endpoint &amp; &quot;NA&quot; represents &quot;Not computable&quot; as only 12.3% of participants achieved NRS reduction during 16-week treatment period &amp; hence median time to achieve ≥ 4-point reduction of NRS for placebo +TCS treated participants could not be reported.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Percent Body Surface Area (BSA) Affected by Atopic Dermatitis (AD) at Week 16</title>
        <description>BSA affected by AD was assessed for each section of the body using the rule of nines (the possible highest score for each region is: head and neck [9%], anterior trunk [18%], back [18%], upper limbs [18%], lower limbs [36%], and genitals [1%]) and were reported as a percentage of all major body sections combined. The proportion assigned to different body regions were different in younger children as compared to older children (head and neck area is assigned a higher proportion in younger children as compared to older children). The FAS included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized).</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Children's Dermatology Life Quality Index (CDLQI) at Week 16</title>
        <description>CDLQI was a validated 10 question tool to measure the impact of skin disease on the quality of life (QOL) in children by assessing how much the skin problem has affected the participant over the past week. Nine questions were scored as follows: Very much = 3, Quite a lot = 2, Only a little = 1, Not at all or unanswered = 0. Question 7 has an added possible response, which was scored as 3. CDLQI equals the sum of the score of each question (maximum = 30, minimum = 0). Higher the score, the greater the impact on QOL. The FAS included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized). Data presented reflects the mean &amp; standard deviation of the CDLQI total scores.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Oriented Eczema Measure (POEM) at Week 16</title>
        <description>POEM was a 7-item, validated questionnaire used to assess disease symptoms in children and adults. The format was a response to 7 items (dryness, itching, flaking, cracking, sleep loss, bleeding, and weeping) based on frequency of these disease symptoms during the past week (ie, 0 = no days, 1 = 1 to 2 days, 2 = 3 to 4 days, 3 = 5 to 6 days, and 4 = all days) with a scoring system of 0 to 28; the total score reflected the disease-related morbidity. The FAS included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized). A high score is indicative of a poor quality of life.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Weekly Average of Daily Worst Itch Score at Week 16</title>
        <description>The worst itch scale was a simple assessment tool that participants used to report the intensity of their pruritus (itch). This was an 11-point scale (0 to 10) in which 0 indicated no itching while 10 indicated worst itching possible. Participants were asked to answer 2 questions daily throughout the entire study (screening period, treatment period, and follow-up period). The daily worst itch score was calculated as the worse of the scores for the 2 questions. The FAS included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized).</description>

        <description>DFI was a 10-item questionnaire with items inquiring about housework, food preparation, sleep, family leisure activity, shopping, expenditure, tiredness, emotional distress, relationships and the impact of helping with treatment on the primary caregiver's life. The DFI questions were scored on a four-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, so that the total DFI score ranges from 0 to 30. Timeframe of reference was the past week. A higher DFI score indicated greater impairment in family Quality of life (QOL) as affected by atopic dermatitis. The FAS included all randomized participants. Efficacy analyses were based on the treatment allocated at randomization (as randomized).</description>

        <description>PROMIS Anxiety instrument measures self-reported fear (fearfulness, panic), anxious misery (worry, dread), hyperarousal (tension, nervousness, restlessness), &amp; somatic symptoms related to arousal (racing heart, dizziness). Each question has 5 response options ranging in value from 1-5 (1=Never, 2=Almost never, 3=Sometimes, 4=Often, 5=Almost Always). Total raw score calculated using sum of response values: for 8-item form, lowest possible is 8 &amp; highest possible is 40; For 6-item form: lowest possible is 6; highest possible is 30. Higher score indicates greater severity of symptoms.</description>
