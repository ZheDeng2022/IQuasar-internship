  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study which consists of 2 parts; Dose Escalation part and Expansion part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose escalation part is open-label, and evaluates safety, preliminary efficacy and PK of&#xD;
      single-agent talazoparib in sequential cohorts of adult patients with advanced solid tumors&#xD;
      who are resistant to standard therapy or for whom no standard therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the dose escalation part, up to 18 (minimum 3) patients are expected to be enrolled&#xD;
      depending on the observed DLTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expansion part is designed to assess the efficacy, safety and PK of single-agent&#xD;
      talazoparib at RP2D determined in the dose escalation part in adult patients with locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic breast cancer who have deleterious or suspected deleterious germline&#xD;
      BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the expansion part, a minimum of 17 patients will be enrolled evaluable for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
