    <textblock>
      This pilot phase II trial studies how well ferumoxytol magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) works&#xD;
      in assessing response to pembrolizumab in patients with glioblastoma. Diagnostic procedures,&#xD;
      such as ferumoxytol MRI, may help measure a patient's response to pembrolizumab treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the sensitivity and specificity of relative cerebral blood volume (rCBV)&#xD;
      measured by steady state MRI with ferumoxytol in identifying true versus (vs)&#xD;
      pseudoprogression in patients with newly diagnosed glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) receiving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab with standard of care chemo-radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the safety and toxicity of pembrolizumab when used in combination with standard&#xD;
      of care chemo radiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Determine the progression free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS), clinical response&#xD;
      and duration of best response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Compare the immune response as determined by the volume, pattern and intensity of delayed&#xD;
      (24 hour [hr]) ferumoxytol uptake between subjects who develop true vs pseudoprogression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Investigate the serum immunological parameters (serum biomarker) and correlate clinical&#xD;
      as well as radiological response with systemic immune response to pembrolizumab as measured&#xD;
      by immunological panel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Compare the changes in PDL-1 expression in the biopsy tissue before and after therapy at&#xD;
      the time of progression and correlate PD-L1 expression with response rates and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Investigate the feasibility of measuring vascular volume fraction (VVF), vessel size&#xD;
      index (VSI) and vessel density index (VDI) as surrogate for response (true vs&#xD;
      pseudoprogression, as determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1&#xD;
      and immune related response criteria [irRC]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes on day 1. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 3 weeks for up to 2 years or 35 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity. Patients also receive ferumoxytol IV and undergo MRI scans at&#xD;
      baseline, 4 weeks after the last day of standard of care stereotactic radiosurgery or&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy, every 9 weeks thereafter until suspected radiographic progression, and&#xD;
      then within 4 weeks from suspected radiographic progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, every 12 weeks for&#xD;
      up to 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
