  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this study is to understand what brain mechanisms become disrupted when stroke&#xD;
      survivors experience delirium. Delirium is an acute reduction in attention and cognition,&#xD;
      associated with poor recovery, longer hospitalization and even death. One major factor&#xD;
      increasing the risk of delirium after stroke may be spatial neglect occurring after stroke on&#xD;
      the right side of the brain. Spatial neglect affects awareness, orientation, and movement.&#xD;
      The study will test the hypothesis that the right-dominant brain networks for arousal and&#xD;
      attention are affected in both of these disorders. It is expected that the activity and&#xD;
      structural integrity of these brain networks will correlate with behavioral signs and&#xD;
      severity of delirium and spatial neglect. To test this hypothesis, the study will measure&#xD;
      spatial neglect and delirium symptoms in 45 acute (NYC Health + Hospitals/Bellevue ) and 30&#xD;
      subacute (Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation) stroke survivors and evaluate brain scans for&#xD;
      these participants. This study may contribute to knowledge about brain bio-markers of&#xD;
      delirium, which will greatly aid in delirium detection in stroke and other disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Delirium assessment and prevention has a tremendous impact on hospitalization outcomes and&#xD;
      health care costs. Delirium is a multi-component syndrome characterized by an acute reduction&#xD;
      in cognitive functioning, affecting awareness, thinking, attention, and memory. Stroke&#xD;
      survivors, representing 17% of the US population aged 65 and over (CDC, 2012), are at major&#xD;
      risk for developing delirium (up to 50% incidence in right-hemisphere stroke). Further, about&#xD;
      50% of right-hemisphere stroke patients experience spatial neglect, impairing safety and&#xD;
      recovery. This study investigates a potential neural mechanism explaining the high incidence&#xD;
      of both delirium and spatial neglect after right-hemisphere stroke. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that the brain networks for arousal and attention, comprised of ascending projections from&#xD;
      the mesencephalic reticular formation and integrating right-dominant dorsal and ventral&#xD;
      cortical and limbic components, may be affected in these disorders. The study assesses&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and behavioral data in right hemisphere stroke survivors. It&#xD;
      is predicted that impaired activity and structural integrity of the brain networks for&#xD;
      arousal and attention will correlate with behavioral signs of delirium and spatial neglect.&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at two sites recruiting an acute (n=45) and a subacute (n=30)&#xD;
      patient samples. The findings of this study have the potential to impact stroke care by&#xD;
      providing a critical biomarker and behavioral profile of post-stroke delirium. This may alert&#xD;
      clinicians to initiating preventive care and targeted interventions in patients who are at&#xD;
      high risk of hospital morbidity and loss of independence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypotheses Hypothesis 1: It is hypothesized that a lesion-deficit analysis will reveal&#xD;
      that in patients with delirium and/or spatial neglect, right-brain areas within the&#xD;
      attention, orientation, and arousal networks are affected by stroke lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Because it is hypothesized that both disorders stem from a dysfunction of&#xD;
      common brain networks, it is expected that spatial neglect severity will be a predictor of&#xD;
      delirium severity, controlling for relative lesion size and stroke severity Hypothesis 3:&#xD;
      Both spatial neglect and delirium severity will be correlated with functional connectivity&#xD;
      among the brain areas within the attention, orientation, and arousal networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4: Based on evidence from prior work in post-surgical delirium patients, neglect&#xD;
      and coma patients, it is hypothesized that the integrity of white matter connections among&#xD;
      brain regions comprising the cortical and subcortical networks for attention, orientation,&#xD;
      and arousal is inversely correlated with the severity of delirium and spatial neglect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To examine the critical network components affected in post-stroke delirium, the study will&#xD;
      examine participants' structural scans. The structural scans recorded in the study will&#xD;
      include a T1-weighted and a T2-weighted FLAIR image for 30 subacute stroke par-ticipants. In&#xD;
      addition, clinical scans will be obtained for the 45 acute stroke participants, resulting in&#xD;
      75 total brain scans. Structural lesions will be mapped using a semi-automated lesion mapping&#xD;
      in MRIcron package, where each brain voxel will be scored in a binary fashion as lesioned or&#xD;
      non-lesioned. Three-dimensional lesion masks will be fed into VLSM 2 software implemented in&#xD;
      Matlab (Voxel Lesion Symptom Mapping). For the pseudo-continuous outcomes, such as the&#xD;
      Behavioral Inattention Test (BIT) and Confusion Assessment Method-Severity (CAM-S) scores, a&#xD;
      t-score will be computed testing whether lesion in a given brain voxel predicts higher or&#xD;
      lower severity score. For the binary outcomes, such as delirium diagnosis, for each voxel a&#xD;
      Leibermeister measure will be computed testing whether a given lesioned voxel predicts&#xD;
      delirium vs. no delirium across all participants. The analysis will serially travel through&#xD;
      the brain voxels and conduct a test in each voxel. The voxels will be thresholded such that&#xD;
      only those that co-occur in at least 5 patients will be considered. In a typical lesion study&#xD;
      this will result in hundreds of voxels considered across participants. The final results are&#xD;
      corrected for multiple comparisons using False Discovery Rate of p&lt;.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis seeks to establish if any association exists between the presence and&#xD;
      severity of post-stroke delirium and spatial neglect. To test this hypothesis a regression&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted using the BIT score as the predictor and the CAM score as an&#xD;
      outcome. The analysis will control for NIH stroke scale score and lesion size, as well as&#xD;
      age. In both sets of analyses raw assessment scores will be converted to percent for scale&#xD;
      uniformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A seed-based functional connectivity analysis will be carried out, testing for a correlation&#xD;
      among time-courses of selected brain regions as a function of CAM-S and BIT scores. 16&#xD;
      regions of interest (ROI) will be used to conduct this analysis within the arousal and&#xD;
      attention networks. A whole brain ROI-to-voxel analysis will also be carried out to capture&#xD;
      any unexpected associations with delirium and neglect severity. This analysis and data&#xD;
      preprocessing will be done using CONN toolbox, a Matlab-based cross-platform software for the&#xD;
      computation, display, and analysis of functional connectivity in fMRI. First, realignment&#xD;
      will be performed between all successive brain volumes and the 1st volume of the series.&#xD;
      Slice-timing correction will be applied to account for the time difference in the interleaved&#xD;
      acquisition of brain slices. Structural segmentation will be performed to create masks of&#xD;
      white matter and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These masks will be used in estimating a nuisance&#xD;
      regressor representing physiological noise. The functional scans will be normalized (aligned)&#xD;
      to the structural scans and the atlas template. This is done for group comparisons and to&#xD;
      allow ROI definition using an anatomical atlas. Functional images will be smoothed with a&#xD;
      6mm-radius kernel. Next, the contribution of motion outliers (large movements), continuous&#xD;
      motion (roll, pitch, and yaw), and physiological noise will be regressed from the data.&#xD;
      Finally, ROI-to-ROI and ROI-to-voxel connectivity will performed within each brain scan to&#xD;
      allow for 2nd-order comparisons (i.e., contribution of delirium and neglect severity scores&#xD;
      to functional connectivity, controlling for covariates).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 4:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A probabilistic tractography analysis will be conduced using 16 ROI, defined a priori from&#xD;
      the literature. The analysis will be carried out on DTI data using diffusion tensor&#xD;
      tractography tools available in the FSL analysis suite (e.g.., Probtrax, FDT Toolbox). The&#xD;
      analysis is expected to identify tracts that connect regions within the attention and arousal&#xD;
      networks. It will estimate voxel-wise Fractional Anisotropy (FA) as a measure of fiber&#xD;
      integrity. FA is a scalar value between 0 and 1, measuring the principal diffusion direction&#xD;
      of water molecules. An FA of 0 indicates a perfect sphere, i.e., uniform diffusion. Places&#xD;
      where adjacent voxels have the same directional coherence of diffusion are probabilistically&#xD;
      assigned to tract locations. The values are then averaged to obtain a global FA for each&#xD;
      tract. Delirium and neglect severity scores will be regressed on FA values in an ANCOVA&#xD;
      (accounting for clinical/demographic/physiological/patient characteristics). If the ROI-based&#xD;
      approach is not successful, whole brain FA maps will be considered including areas outside&#xD;
      the brain networks of interest, for an association with delirium and neglect severity scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot investigation was conducted to estimate effect size. 19 right-brain stroke patients&#xD;
      (12 females, 8 Caucasian, 8 African American, 3 Asian), aged 60 years (SD=17 years),&#xD;
      comprised of 1 chronic (&gt; 6 months post-stroke) and 18 subacute (&lt; 1 month post-stroke)&#xD;
      participated in the pilot study. R-squared value of .26 was obtained for the association&#xD;
      between delirium and neglect severity. This gives an effect size (Cohen's f2) of .35. With&#xD;
      this effect size, there is over 99% power to observe the effect, assuming a sample size of 75&#xD;
      patients and an alpha of .05 (Hypothesis 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate power of our lesion deficit analysis (Hypothesis 1), data was simulated using&#xD;
      15%, 30%, and 50% as proportion of the participant sample in whom the same voxel will be&#xD;
      lesioned. Leibermeister approach was applied to compute p-values for testing the null&#xD;
      hypothesis of no association between voxel lesion status and delirium status. With 75&#xD;
      participants (Acute+Subacute Sample) there is over 80% power to detect an effect, assuming&#xD;
      that at least 30 percent of the sample have the same lesion, and the lesion is between 40-100&#xD;
      voxels, forming a tight cluster. These are reasonable assumptions given past studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the pilot study, a general linear model that included as regressor delirium or neglect&#xD;
      severity score was applied to the 16X16 ROI connectivity measure matrix for each participant.&#xD;
      The resulting t-scores for the between-subjects effects were in the range of 4.61 to 7.88 for&#xD;
      the BIT measure and 7.07 to 9.31 for the CAM-S. These t-scores correspond to a large effect&#xD;
      size. Using a Cohen's f of .35 (large effect) to estimate power for linear multiple&#xD;
      regression, with 4 predictors, an alpha level of .05, and a two-tailed test, it is estimated&#xD;
      that there will be 87% power to observe this effect, given a sample of 30 participants (Acute&#xD;
      sample) (Hypothesis 3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A previous study reported thalamus fractional anisotropy (FA) of .315 (.026) in delirious&#xD;
      compared to .333 (.023) in non-delirious patients. These values correspond to a large Cohen's&#xD;
      d effect size. Assuming that FA values in a similar range will be observed, there is&#xD;
      excellent power to detect these effects with a linear multiple regression model.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on average patient flow, is is estimated that up to 20 patients will be screened&#xD;
      monthly for study eligibility at each site. Based on recruitment rates of the pilot sample,&#xD;
      it is estimated that 10-20% of the screening sample will be consented. Factoring in a&#xD;
      conservative dropout estimate of 25-40%, it is more than likely that the proposed study&#xD;
      sample will be recruited. To account for patient attrition, the study will over-recruit the&#xD;
      target sample by 5 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated rates of delirium and neglect after right brain stroke are around 50% . Therefore,&#xD;
      around 50 of the study sample is expected to have neglect, delirium, or both. In addition to&#xD;
      using delirium/neglect status as a dichotomous variable, quasi-continuous severity scores for&#xD;
      each variable will be used, which will increase the power to detect associations between&#xD;
      these two disorders and brain lesion locations.&#xD;
