  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic liver disease including cirrhosis is one of the most important factors in the&#xD;
      multi-step progression of hepatocarcinogenesis, from benign regenerative nodules to early&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinomas (HCCs) and finally to overt HCCs. Early diagnosis of HCC,&#xD;
      differentiation from benign hepatocellular nodules, and surgical resection of the tumor or&#xD;
      transplantation of the liver provide the best chance for long-term survival. Several studies&#xD;
      have evaluated MRI enhanced with superparamagnetic iron oxide, gadolinium-based contrast&#xD;
      material, or both, for the detection and differential diagnosis of focal hepatic lesions.&#xD;
      However, the differentiation of HCC from benign and or borderline hepatocellular nodules&#xD;
      remains difficult, particularly in patients with cirrhosis, because of the architectural&#xD;
      distortion of liver parenchyma and the development of cirrhotic nodules, ranging from benign&#xD;
      regenerative nodules to overt HCC, with overlapping imaging features. Recently, gadoxetic&#xD;
      acid (gadoliniumethoxybezyl-diethylenetriamine pentaacetic acid; PrimovistÂ®, Bayer Health&#xD;
      Care Pharmaceuticals), a gadolinium-based paramagnetic contrast agent that produces both&#xD;
      dynamic and liver-specific hepatobiliary MRI studies has gained widespread use. Some studies&#xD;
      have showed that gadoxetic acid-enhanced MRI allows the accurate detection and&#xD;
      characterization of HCC. Investigators plan to assess this in particular as it is a question&#xD;
      of great relevance. Execution of well conducted prospective studies will also clarify&#xD;
      inclusion of Gd-EOB-DTPA enhanced MRI as the technique of choice in evaluation of patients at&#xD;
      risk for HCC.&#xD;
