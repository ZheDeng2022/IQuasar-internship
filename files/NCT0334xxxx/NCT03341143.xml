  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this research study is to determine if the fecal microbiota transplant (FMT)&#xD;
      improves the body's ability to fight your cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase II Simon two-stage single-center study of concurrent fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplang (FMT) with pembrolizumab in patients with PD-1 resistant/refractory melanoma. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted over a 12-week period (and up to 24-weeks in responding patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient eligibility is based upon prior exposure to PD-1 inhibitor therapy and response at&#xD;
      first (or subsequent) restaging scans from week 12 up to week 52. Patients must have received&#xD;
      a minimum of 2 cycles to be considered eligible. Patients who have received either nivolumab&#xD;
      or pembrolizumab are eligible. Patients who have received pembrolizumab/nivolumab in&#xD;
      combination with other investigational agent(s) may be eligible at the discretion of the&#xD;
      treating investigator. PD-1 refractory disease is defined as progressive disease (PD) at the&#xD;
      first (or subsequent) radiographic evaluation while receiving PD-1 inhibitor treatment as&#xD;
      assessed by RECIST v1.1 on a restaging scan. Other eligibility criteria include absence of&#xD;
      CNS disease, presence of disease amenable to biopsy and lack of contra-indications to FMT&#xD;
      administration. Patients will be stratified on the presence or absence of liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suitable patients will be identified following first (or subsequent) restaging study that&#xD;
      documents progressive disease (RECIST v1.1). Patients will undergo a screening evaluation&#xD;
      consisting of imaging (including CNS if clinically suspected), tumor biopsy, and&#xD;
      serological/stool studies to confirm suitability for FMT administration. Eligible patients&#xD;
      will receive FMT endoscopically (along with intestinal biopsy) (with cycle 1 pembrolizumab&#xD;
      +/- 3 days) followed by 3 further cycles of pembrolizumab (cycles 2-4) following which&#xD;
      restaging will be performed. Patients with stable and/or responding disease will continue to&#xD;
      receive pembrolizumab on study for 4 cycles. Patients with stable and/or responding disease&#xD;
      after 8 cycles of pembrolizumab will continue to receive therapy off study until disease&#xD;
      progression or up to two years from FMT administration.&#xD;

    <description>FMT is a procedure in which fecal matter or stool is collected from a tested donor, mixed with a saline or other solution, strained and infused into the colon by doing a colonoscopy. The FMT consists of introducing normal bacterial flora contained in stool collected from a donor into your small intestine. In this case, the donor is patient with advanced melanoma who has been treated with a PD-1 inhibitor (nivolumab or pembrolizumab) and has been rendered disease-free as a result. The FMT will be performed on Cycle 1 Day 1.&#xD;
Pembrolizumab, 200mg, through an IV over 30 minutes on Cycle 1 Day 1 (same day as the FMT, and then again on Day 1 of each 21-day cycle for an additional 3 cycles (Cycles 2 - 4).</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of unresectable stage III&#xD;
             or IV melanoma. Patient may not have a diagnosis of uveal or mucosal melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have received any number of prior systemic therapies for metastatic disease. Prior&#xD;
             radiation therapy (any number) and interferon use (any formulation and/or duration) in&#xD;
             the adjuvant or metastatic disease settings is permitted. Vaccine therapy will be&#xD;
             counted as systemic therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must currently be receiving systemic PD-1 immunotherapy with pembrolizumab or&#xD;
             nivolumab to be eligible. Patients who have received PD-1 immunotherapy in the&#xD;
             adjuvant setting and then replaced are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must be PD-1 inhibitor refractory/resistant - defined as having received at least 2&#xD;
             doses of pembrolizumab with documented systemic disease progression on staging&#xD;
             imaging. PD will be defined as increase in tumor burden &gt; 20% relative to nadir&#xD;
             (minimum recorded tumor burden) by RECIST v1.1. Once PD is confirmed, initial date of&#xD;
             PD documentation will be considered as the date of disease progression. Patients can&#xD;
             be enrolled at any time following initiation of PD-1 therapy assuming they have not&#xD;
             had (at any time) a record of response to PD-1 therapy (prior best response of stable&#xD;
             disease - acceptable; prior best response of complete/partial response -&#xD;
             unacceptable). For patients receiving adjuvant PD-1 inhibitor therapy, initial date of&#xD;
             PD documentation will be considered as the date of disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with CNS progression (parenchymal but not leptomeningeal) are eligible if CNS&#xD;
             metastases are treated and deemed stable (with a repeat CT/MRI imaging study) prior to&#xD;
             the enrollment date. If radiation is used to treat CNS parenchymal disease, a 2 week&#xD;
             washout period will apply (counted from Day 1 treatment). Stability must be confirmed&#xD;
             with a repeat CT/MRI imaging study performed as part of the screening evaluation (at&#xD;
             least 2 weeks after radiation). Patients with new CNS metastases identified during&#xD;
             screening are ineligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent to receive FMT administered endoscopically (colonoscopically) and undergo&#xD;
             necessary bowel preparation pre-procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand infectious risks associated with FMT administration. Although FMT infusate&#xD;
             has been screened for bacteria, viruses, fungi and parasites there is a risk of&#xD;
             transmission of known and unknown infectious organisms contained in the donor stool.&#xD;
             Post-FMT bacteremia (e.g. E. coli), sepsis and fatal events may rarely occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand non-infectious risks associated with FMT administration. Possible allergy&#xD;
             and/or anaphylaxis to antigens in donor stool; theoretical risk of developing disease&#xD;
             possibly related to donor gut microbiota including but not limited to: obesity,&#xD;
             metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions, allergic/atopic&#xD;
             disorders, neurologic disorders, psychiatric conditions and malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand risks associated with colonoscopy including risk of infection transmission,&#xD;
             colonic perforation, aspiration pneumonia, and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand that data regarding the long-term safety risk of FMT are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Consent to participate in the correlative studies and should have available tumor&#xD;
             tissue for tumor biopsies. Acceptable biopsies include surgical biopsy, core biopsy or&#xD;

             be amenable to biopsy and this may not be the site of disease used to measure&#xD;
             antitumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to provide written informed consent for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;

        (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN OR ≤ 5 X ULN for patients with liver metastases Albumin &gt;2.5 mg/dL&#xD;
        International Normalized Ratio (INR) or Prothrombin Time (PT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless patient is&#xD;
        receiving anticoagulant therapy as long as PT or PTT is within therapeutic range of&#xD;
        intended use of anticoagulants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Activated Partial Thromboplastin Time (aPTT) ≤1.5 X ULN unless patient is receiving&#xD;
