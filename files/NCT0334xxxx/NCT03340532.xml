      SunSmart is a novel video intervention designed to prevent secondary skin cancer in young&#xD;
      adult cancer survivors by increasing their adherence to recommended sun protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess two versions of the SunSmart video intervention. These are: 1) The&#xD;
      INFORMATION VIDEO providing basic information about UV risks, including secondary skin cancer&#xD;
      and the benefits of sun protection (SP), as well as specific SP recommendations and steps to&#xD;
      integrate SP as part of routine self-care for the healthy cancer survivor; and 2) THE&#xD;
      INFORMATION + APPEARANCE VIDEO which will include the full information video, along with an&#xD;
      additional embedded video segment emphasizing negative appearance consequences of UV&#xD;
      exposure. Primary aim of the study is to assess the impact of the video intervention on sun&#xD;
      protection intentions and behavior in young adult cancer survivors compared to a control&#xD;
      intervention. Secondary aims are to describe the impact of the appearance information when&#xD;
      included in the SunSmart intervention, to investigate the extent to which the intervention&#xD;
      changes sun protection through hypothesized mediating variables, and to describe the&#xD;
      consistency of sleep behaviors over time in cancer survivors.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants are randomized to view one of two SunSmart educational videos or a control video on sleep hygiene. In the three months following the video intervention, participants' sun protection attitudes and behaviors are assessed. An additional measure of sun protection behaviors 12-months later will be provided by participants who participate in the optional 1-year follow-up.</intervention_model_description>
