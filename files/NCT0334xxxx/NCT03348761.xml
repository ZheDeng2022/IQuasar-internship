  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies on network mechanism of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS)&#xD;
      suggest that pretreatment resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI)&#xD;
      connectivity may serve as a predictive biomarker for antidepressant treatment response. In&#xD;
      phase I of the study, the focus was on the predictive value of pretreatment connectivity&#xD;
      between the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and subgenual anterior cingulate&#xD;
      cortex (sgACC). However, preliminary results indicated a more complex pattern. Additionally,&#xD;
      accessibility to magnetic resonance imaging scanners is often limited and costly. Therefore,&#xD;
      in phase II of the study, a more affordable way to measure the blood-oxygen-level-dependent&#xD;
      signal was examined, known as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). The aims of this&#xD;
      study are identifying biomarkers for predicting and monitoring treatment response to&#xD;
      neuronavigated TMS in medication-resistant depression and examine the clinical utility of&#xD;
      fNIRS.&#xD;

      Research Plan and Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. Sampling Participants will be referred by psychiatrists from specialist outpatient clinics&#xD;
      based in the regional hospitals of New Territories East Cluster under the Hospital Authority&#xD;
      of Hong Kong. Written informed consents will be obtained from all participants according to&#xD;
      the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Pretreatment assessment A) Baseline clinical assessment At baseline (before treatment),&#xD;
      subjects' age, level of education, handedness will be noted by research assistant. A research&#xD;
      psychiatrist will administer MADRS1, HDRS2, DSM-IV SCID-I/II 3-4 to ascertain current/&#xD;
      lifetime Axis I and II psychiatric diagnosis and score on Global Assessment of Functioning,&#xD;
      age at onset of MDD and number of major depressive episodes, number of failed&#xD;
      antidepressants, current life stressor(s) and the perceived severity on a visual analog scale&#xD;
      of 0-10, and clinical global impression scale (CGI).5 Subjects are asked to complete&#xD;
      self-administered questionnaires including 1) Beck Depression Inventory II 6 that has been&#xD;
      validated in local Chinese dialect 7; 2) a 60-item NEO Five Factor Inventory that measures&#xD;
      five personality traits on neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness&#xD;
      and conscientiousness;8 3) ruminative response subscale (Chinese version) (RRS) of the&#xD;
      response style questionnaire, a 22-item questionnaire comprising of two distinct factors on&#xD;
      brooding and reflection.9 Published data suggest rumination may be correlated positively with&#xD;
      duration of depressive episode and predict onset of depressive episode10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B1) Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) of brain for neuro-navigated rTMS and resting&#xD;
      state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) to map intrinsic functional connectivity (baseline, 2 weeks&#xD;
      and 8 weeks post-treatment) A whole brain anatomical data set is acquired with T1-weighted&#xD;
      sequence (repetition time(TR)/echo time(TE): 7.6/3.5ms, field of view 230mm, 250 contiguous&#xD;
      slices, 0.6mm thickness, reconstruction matrix 224 x 224) for voxel-based morphometry (VBM)&#xD;
      analysis and functional to anatomical image co-registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A resting-state functional MRI will be taken for either six (phase I) or twelve minutes&#xD;
      (phase II). Subjects will be instructed with written cues projected (for 5 seconds) on the&#xD;
      screen to stay relaxed and look at the fixation cross hair. Stimuli are projected on a TV&#xD;
      monitor equipped by MRI-compatible Esys (Invivo) system. Subjects view the screen through&#xD;
      mirror glasses. The functional scans are acquired on a 3.0-T whole-body scanner (Achieva TX,&#xD;
      Philips Healthcare, Best, the Netherlands) using PRESTO (principles of echo shifting with a&#xD;
      train of observation) sequence (TR28ms, TE 12ms, flip angle 7°. Slab thickness 125mm, 230mm&#xD;
      field of view, data matrix 80 x 51 x 25) with a nominal in-plane resolution of 2.8 x 2.8mm&#xD;
      and a temporal resolution of 2.7 sec/scan. Slices will be tilted about 30º clockwise along&#xD;
      the AC-PC plane to obtain better signal in the orbitofrontal cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the functional and anatomical MRI data are transferred to an offline workstation for&#xD;
      image analysis. MRI data will be preprocessed using the default pipeline of the CONN toolbox&#xD;
      v18.b11, which is an open-source MATLAB (2019B, Mathworks, Natick, MA, USA) and SPM-based&#xD;
      (Statistical Parametric Mapping, www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/) cross-platform software1. The&#xD;
      preprocessing steps included realignment and unwarping, temporal slice time correction,&#xD;
      functional outlier detection (ART-based identification of outlier scans), segmentation,&#xD;
      normalization and smoothing (8 mm Gaussian kernel). The best way to denoise resting-state&#xD;
      fMRI data is currently still a controversial topic12. Therefore, component based noise&#xD;
      correction with and without global signal regression11,13. will be applied. For denoising&#xD;
      with component based noise correction a principal component analysis was used to identify the&#xD;
      time series data from the noise regions, including white matter and cerebrospinal fluid.&#xD;
      Significant principal components are then introduced as covariates in the general linear&#xD;
      model as an estimate of the physiological noise signal space. Regressors: white matter (10&#xD;
      dimensions), cerebrospinal fluid (5 dimensions), realignment parameters (6 dimensions),&#xD;
      scrubbing (61 dimensions). Further, a default temporal band-pass filter (.008-.09 Hz) and&#xD;
      detrending. For global signal regression the same procedure was performed, but an additional&#xD;
      regressor of the global signal (1 dimension) was added. The Subject-level correlation&#xD;
      coefficients of the regions of interest and seed maps were converted to normally distributed&#xD;
      Fisher-transformed Z scores to conform to the assumptions of generalised linear models. These&#xD;
      connectivity values and statistical seed maps were subsequently used for the second-level&#xD;
      analyses to examine group differences (responders versus nonresponders) and perform&#xD;
      correlational analyses to examine whether either pretreatment connectivity or change in&#xD;
      functional connectivity is associated with TMS treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B2) Offline resting state FNIRS (baseline and serial measures) In a sub-sample of subjects&#xD;
      who agree for extra brain mapping sessions, offline resting state FNIRS measures will be&#xD;
      taken in pre-treatment phase (within 7-10 days before first rTMS session), week 2 and week 4&#xD;
      in the course of rTMS treatment, 2 weeks and 8 weeks post-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FNIRS measurements will be taken in a specialized laboratory situated in the Center for&#xD;
      Cognition and Brain Studies, Department of Psychology of CUHK (Sino Building of Chung Chi&#xD;
      College), which is in close proximity to University MTR station and inside the same amenity&#xD;
      as the CU Clinical Psychology Department.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be instructed to keep still with eyes closed, relax their mind and remain&#xD;
      motionless for two blocks of 15-minute resting state session (totaling 30 minutes). The&#xD;
      target mapping areas are bilateral fronto-parietal areas for their roles in default mode&#xD;
      network (DMN). Optical signals will be recorded on a two-wavelength (690 and 830 nm, 110MHz)&#xD;
      frequency-domain oximeter (Imagent, ISS Inc., Champaign, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Offline mode is opted in this study as clinical applicability is our main concern.&#xD;
      Simultaneous FNIRS-rTMS is theoretically possible but the set-up will substantially increase&#xD;
      session time, compromising the tolerability of rTMS session and likely compliance. Aside,&#xD;
      previous studies have shown the FNIRS signal changes are sustainable and detectable with&#xD;
      offline measures after TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FNIRS are measured with source fibers emitting light at the two different wavelengths&#xD;
      that are co-localized as a pair, giving rise to 24 source locations. Photons that scatter&#xD;
      through the head are collected by 16 detector fiber bundles connected to photomultiplier&#xD;
      tubes (PMTs). These sources and detectors are held on the participants' scalp with a rigid&#xD;
      custom-made head-mount system (montage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sources and detectors are arranged in groups of two parallel rows (1.7 cm to 2.5 cm apart&#xD;
      from each other) to create overlapping light channels so as to increase the spatial&#xD;
      resolution and signal-to-noise ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source-detector placement in each of the four mapping areas (left and right frontal, left and&#xD;
      right parietal) is opted. After the montage is positioned, coordinates of 230 points on the&#xD;
      scalp, including the locations of source-detector pairs and three fiducial points (nasion,&#xD;
      left and right pre-auricular points), are digitized using ASA 4.5 software (ANT, Netherlands)&#xD;
      in conjunction with an infrared camera and 3-dimensional digitization system (Visor, ANT BV,&#xD;
      1mm spatial resolution). These points are used for calculation of the exact source-detector&#xD;
      distance for data analysis and, more importantly, for co-registration of functional optical&#xD;
      data with each participant's structural MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The individually co-registered data are then Talairach-transformed to permit comparison&#xD;
      across subjects. The ISS Imagent control box is connected to a computer that controls and&#xD;
      records the intensity of emitted and recorded signals. The sampling rate used in this study&#xD;
      is 19.5Hz, giving rise to a 51.3ms sampling interval. During this interval, light sources are&#xD;
      time multiplexed to allow different sources to be distinguished from each other. Light&#xD;
      intensity and phase-delay data are computed and stored in ASCII format in the computer during&#xD;
      the recording. Similar to fMRI analyses, predicted time series are generated by convolving&#xD;
      the hemodynamic response function (SPM 8) with the impulse function for each event, i.e.,&#xD;
      from the onset to the offset of one sequence trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulse-corrected bandpass-filtered oxy-haemoglobin concentration change from each channel&#xD;
      is then correlated with the predicted time series for repeated and random conditions&#xD;
      separately for each recording block and each participant. The Beta weight for each condition&#xD;
      is estimated, Fisher-transformed, and averaged across each recording block for each&#xD;
      participant in each session. The averaged data are analyzed using Opt-3 for the generation of&#xD;
      statistical maps. In Opt-3D, the optical signal, in this case, hemoglobin concentration&#xD;
      change, for a given voxel is defined as the mean value of the channels that overlap at that&#xD;
      particular voxel. Channels with source-detector distances shorter than 20mm and longer than&#xD;
      60mm are excluded from statistical map analysis as the light path would be too short to have&#xD;
      reached the cortical surface or too long to have enough light reaching the detector,&#xD;
      respectively. Channels will be removed if the standard deviation of the phase delay data is&#xD;
      greater than 230 picoseconds (i.e. the channel is excessively noisy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Neuro-navigated rTMS protocol rTMS treatment suite and personnel: the treatment facilities&#xD;
      are based in Chen Wai Wai Vivien Foundation Therapeutic Physical Mental Exercise Centre,&#xD;
      which is a CU clinical and research center sponsored by private funds where the physicians&#xD;
      delivering the treatment (PI and co-PI) are serving on-site. The treatment center is equipped&#xD;
      with resuscitation facilities. Full-time research staff and physiotherapists are available to&#xD;
      handle medical and behavioral emergencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulator set-up: Neuro-navigated high-frequency rTMS over a specific area on left DLPFC&#xD;
      (between BA9 and BA46, junction of middle and anterior two-thirds of the middle frontal&#xD;
      gyrus) will be provided using Magstim Super Rapid2 (Phase I) or Neurosoft Neuro-MS/D Advanced&#xD;
      Therapeutic Transcranial Magnetic Stimulator (Phase II) that both generate short duration&#xD;
      biphasic pulses. A figure-of-eight coil will be held in place with a custom-made stand&#xD;
      tangential to the scalp with the handle pointing back and away from the midline at 45&#xD;
      degrees. The resting motor threshold will be determined Motor Evoked Potential or the&#xD;
      standard visual method (whichever revealed the lowest motor threshold).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation parameters Phase I: 10 hertz, 120% motor threshold, thirty trains of 5 seconds&#xD;
      with 25 seconds between trains, 1500 pulses per day delivered 5 days per week, totaling 30000&#xD;
      pulses over 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation parameters Phase II: triplet 50 hertz, repeated at 5 hertz, 120% motor threshold,&#xD;
      twenty trains of 2 seconds with 8 seconds between trains, 600 pulses per day delivered 5 days&#xD;
      per week, totaling 12000 pulses over 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stimulation localization: The DLPFC coordinates of the stimulation target site is determined&#xD;
      individually for each participant using a structural T1-weighted MRI scan. This area is&#xD;
      defined around the junction of Brodmann area 9 and 46. To coregister the scan with the&#xD;
      patient's head, advanced stereotactic techniques incorporated into Brainsight TMS (Rogue&#xD;
      Research Inc., Canada) for phase I of the study and the Neural Navigator (Brain Science Tools&#xD;
      BV, Netherlands) for phase II of the study were used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Clinical follow-up and outcome assessments All participants are evaluated by a research&#xD;
      psychiatrist who is blinded to the functional connectivity maps of the participants and other&#xD;
      potential clinical predictors of response measured at baseline. Follow-up assessments are&#xD;
      scheduled at the end of week 2, week 4, week 6, week 8, and week 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measures are the percentage change in symptom scores on MADRS and CGI at week&#xD;
      4, week 6, week 8, and week 12 compared to baseline. Secondary outcome measures include&#xD;
      scores on GAF, BDI and RRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical response is defined as CGI= 2 and 50% reduction of MADRS score from baseline,&#xD;
      respectively at the end of six weeks and twelve weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical remission criteria is MADRS &lt;7 and CGI of 1, respectively at the end of six weeks&#xD;
      and twelve weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Management of decompensated mental states, serious adverse somatic reactions to rTMS and&#xD;
      drop-outs The research psychiatrists (PI and co-I) are responsible for the detection of&#xD;
      high-risk mental states (emergence of psychotic symptoms, catatonic state, suicide ideation,&#xD;
      and para-suicide state) at the regular follow-up assessments. Physical adverse effects will&#xD;
      be checked at each follow-up and evaluated on the severity. In times of emergent risky mental&#xD;
      state and adverse somatic reactions, the research psychiatrists will work collaboratively&#xD;
      with the participant and if necessary, the treating psychiatrists on the necessary&#xD;
      psychiatric and medical management plans. All adverse effects will be reported to the&#xD;
      &quot;serious adverse effect monitoring sub-committee&quot; under the local ethics committee. All&#xD;
      drop-out participants will be assessed by phone followed by clinic-based interviews to work&#xD;
      out the care plan as indicated clinically. At the end of the study, the subjects will receive&#xD;
      the generic psychiatric service as they are originally entitled to. The research team will&#xD;
      ensure seamless aftercare will be arranged for all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. Sample size estimation The sample size estimation is based on the parameter estimate that&#xD;
      addresses the main objective. In our study, it is the expected Pearson correlation&#xD;
      coefficient between functional connectivity of the ROIs and quantitative measure of clinical&#xD;
      efficacy (percentage drop in MADRS score). In Fox et al's study (2012)14, the correlation&#xD;
      coefficient is -0.355 (p&lt;0.05 one-tailed). According to Friedman's partial power table, the&#xD;
      required sample size is at least 58 at alpha=0.8 and Pearson r= 0.35. Taking into account the&#xD;
      drop-out rate of 20% reported in the active rTMS group of a prior randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      comparing the efficacy of neuro-navigated rTMS and conventional targeting protocol, the&#xD;
      required sample size that is sufficiently powered to examine the main objective is adjusted&#xD;
      to 128.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vii. Data analyses Intention-to-treat analysis will be adopted with the last observation&#xD;
      carried forward for participants with at least one post-baseline observation. To describe the&#xD;
      trajectory of clinical response over the course of follow-up, survival analysis will be used&#xD;
      to track the proportions of responders and remitters respectively at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the main objectives, we plan to perform:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group comparison of functional connectivity between ROIs between clinically defined&#xD;
           responders and non-responders at 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. We&#xD;
           hypothesize pre-treatment anti-correlation between the left DLPFC target and subgenual&#xD;
           cingulate is stronger in responders than non-responders at the respective time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group comparison of functional connectivity between ROIs in clinically defined remitters&#xD;
           and non-remitters at 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks, respectively. We hypothesize&#xD;
           pre-treatment anti-correlation between the left DLPFC target and subgenual cingulate is&#xD;
           stronger in remitters than non-remitters at the respective time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Correlations analyses of the functional connectivity between ROIs and percentage drop in&#xD;
           MADRS scores at 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks compared to baseline, respectively. We&#xD;
           hypothesize larger percentage drop in MADRS from baseline correlates with greater&#xD;
           anti-correlation between the left DLPFC target and subgenual cingulate, at the&#xD;
           respective time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. multiple linear regression of functional connectivity between ROIs on percentage drop in&#xD;
           MADRS score from baseline at 4 weeks, 6 weeks and 12 weeks respectively, in the presence&#xD;
           of other baseline demographic and clinical characteristics. We hypothesize higher&#xD;
           percentage drop in MADRS from baseline correlates with greater anti-correlation between&#xD;
           the left DLPFC target and subgenual cingulate, at the respective time points after&#xD;
           adjusting for baseline demographic and clinical characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Correlate FNIRS signals in left DLPFC detected in week 1 and 2 with depressive symptom&#xD;
           scores (MADRS) in week 6, 8, and 12 in order to look for early biomarkers for treatment&#xD;
           response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Group comparison of FNIRS signals in left DLPFC detected 7-10 days before rTMS treatment&#xD;
           in clinically defined responders and non-responders at 6 weeks and 12 weeks,&#xD;
           respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Declaration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research protocol fully complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and the guidelines of&#xD;
      ICH-GCP.&#xD;
