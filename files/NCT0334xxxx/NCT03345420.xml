    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well hypofractionated radiation therapy works in treating&#xD;
      patients with stage 0-IIB breast cancer. Hypofractionated radiation therapy delivers higher&#xD;
      doses of radiation therapy over a shorter period of time and may kill more tumor cells and&#xD;
      have fewer side effects.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate 24 month breast photographic cosmetic scores with 9 fraction radiation&#xD;
      compared to standard hypofractionation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate Breast-Q patient reported outcomes (PROs) compared to historical control in&#xD;
      breast conservation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the incidence of acute and late radiation complications, based on Common&#xD;
      Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.0 toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the local and local regional recurrence rate. IV. To compare the direct and&#xD;
      indirect patient costs for radiation therapy compared to historical controls as well as&#xD;
      quality adjusted life years, utilizing the Breast-Q Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) and the&#xD;
      EQ-5D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 12 weeks after breast conserving surgery, patients undergo hypofractionated radiation&#xD;
      therapy for 9 fractions over 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-8 weeks, 6 months, and&#xD;
      annually for 3 years.&#xD;
