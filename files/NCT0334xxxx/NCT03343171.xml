      The primary objective of this study is to obtain implant survivorship and clinical outcome&#xD;
      data for the commercially available Zimmer® Continuum™ Ceramic-on-Ceramic Bearing System when&#xD;
      used in primary hip arthroplasty. This will be done by analysis of standard scoring systems,&#xD;
      radiographs and adverse event records. Data will be used to monitor pain, mobility and&#xD;
      survivorship, and to confirm the safety and efficacy of the Continuum Ceramic-on-Ceramic&#xD;
      Bearing System.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The subject of this clinical investigation is the Continuum Ceramic Bearing THA System in&#xD;
      primary total hip arthroplasty. This system consists of a cementless modular Trabecular&#xD;
      Metal™ (TM) Continuum Acetabular Shell, a modular BIOLOX delta Taper liner, and a modular&#xD;
      BIOLOX delta femoral head. The characteristics of this THA system may allow for reduction in&#xD;
      wear and osteolysis as compared to other approved and marketed THA systems and thus increase&#xD;
      the expected implant life. The study design will be a prospective, multicenter,&#xD;
      non-comparative post-market study, involving orthopedic surgeons skilled in hip arthroplasty&#xD;
      procedures. A total of 200 patients will be enrolled into the study distributed between 6&#xD;
      study centres. This number of clinical centers will permit assessment of consistency among a&#xD;
      multitude of investigators. Follow-up visits will. be performed at 6 weeks, 6 months, 1,2, 3,&#xD;
      5; 7 and 10 years post-operatively. All potential study subjects will be required to&#xD;
      participate in the Informed Consent Process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and performance of the Implant System will be assessed as following: implant&#xD;
      survivorship based on revision with removal of the study device; safety based on incidence&#xD;
      and frequency of adverse events; and Performance will be determined by comparing the overall&#xD;
      pain and functional performances, survivorship, subject quality-of-life and radiographic&#xD;
      parameters of study subjects who received the Continuum Ceramic Bearing System.&#xD;
