  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study of the infusion of haploidentical NK cells with IL-2 in 5 HIV+&#xD;
      individuals who are on stable ART with full HIV suppression.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Potential subjects will be screened to determine eligibility. Immediately after consent and&#xD;
      screening, an HLA-haploidentical donor will be identified and will complete eligibility&#xD;
      screen and consent. At Day -7 the subject will undergo an inguinal lymph node biopsy and&#xD;
      colonoscopy to obtain ileal and rectal biopsies. Blood samples will be obtained to measure&#xD;
      chimerisms, plasma HIV RNA, and inflammatory cytokines. PBMCs will be obtained to sort into&#xD;
      CD4 subsets and measure frequencies of HIV RNA and DNA. On Day -1, the donor will undergo&#xD;
      apheresis and donor cells will be obtained and incubated overnight with IL-2. On Day 0&#xD;
      subjects will start aspirin and be infused with IL-2 activated NK cells. Subjects will&#xD;
      receive 6 million units of IL-2 just after the infusion and they will be monitored on the&#xD;
      Phase 1 Unit for 24 hours. Plasma will be obtained at 2 hrs, 4 hrs and the following morning&#xD;
      and stored for measures of inflammatory markers. The subject will return to the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic on days 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 after the infusion for administration of 6 million units of&#xD;
      IL-2 and to obtain plasma and PBMC for measures of inflammatory markers and changes to the&#xD;
      virus reservoir. On day 14 the subject will stop taking ASA and blood will be obtained to&#xD;
      measure frequencies of HIV RNA and DNA. On day 21 will have a lymph node biopsy and&#xD;
      colonoscopy to obtain ileal and rectal tissues. The patient will then be followed until day&#xD;
      100 post NK cell infusion. Subjects will return every 2 weeks for a toxicity assessment,&#xD;
      blood draws, and viral level testing. Study participation will end after day 100.&#xD;

                  RNA/mL depending on the assay) for ≥ 6 months (a total of 3 measurements above&#xD;
                  the level of detection but &lt; 500 copies/ml will be allowed if each detectable&#xD;
                  measure is separated by at least 1 year)&#xD;
