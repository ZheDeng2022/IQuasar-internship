  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consecutive patients with ACLF (Acute on Chronic Liver Failure) and septic shock with AKI&#xD;
      (Acute Kidney Injury) who give written informed consent will be included in this prospective&#xD;
      trial at ILBS. At baseline s, endotoxin levels, NT-Pro BNP, , urine N-GAL will be done for&#xD;
      all patients. A 10 ml serum sample will be stored for doing a cytokine profile. Septic shock&#xD;
      will be defined by the presence of two or more diagnostic criteria for the systemic&#xD;
      inflammatory response syndrome, proven or suspected infection with hypotension non-responsive&#xD;
      to adequate fluid resuscitation assessed by no evidence of stroke volume variation on flow&#xD;
      track and need of a vasopressor to achieve a target mean arterial pressure (MAP) of ≥ 65 mm&#xD;
      Hg. A record of CVP, IVC diameter and B-lines on ultrasound lung would also be done. Patients&#xD;
      with age less than 18 years, severe known cardiopulmonary disease (structural or valvular&#xD;
      heart disease, coronary artery disease, COPD) pregnancy, chronic kidney disease, patients&#xD;
      already meeting emergency criteria for immediate hemodialysis at the time of randomization as&#xD;
      specified in the late group, patients transferred from other hospitals who have already been&#xD;
      on hemodialysis before their arrival in the intensive care unit, extremely moribund patients&#xD;
      with an expected life expectancy of less than 24 hours, failure to give informed consent from&#xD;
      family members.&#xD;
