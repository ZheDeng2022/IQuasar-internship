  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is submitted that incident and prevalent chronic periodontal infection, known as chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis (CP) possibly has a causal relationship with diabetes mellitus (DM) having&#xD;
      effects on HbA1c, fasting plasma/ blood glucose (FPG/ FBG) and fasting plasma insulin (FPI)&#xD;
      levels. Experimental research has suggested that treating CP may improve glycemic control and&#xD;
      insulin resistance in Non-Insulin Dependent Type-2 DM patients (T2DM). However, there is&#xD;
      limited data concerning the need and effects of adjunct antibiotic therapy (AAT) along with&#xD;
      scaling root planning (SRP) in treating CP for long lasting results. Therefore, it is&#xD;
      suggested that further research with larger samples must be undertaken for a successful&#xD;
      periodontal therapy that may help improve glycemic control at desired levels and longer&#xD;
      durations. This study is designed to evaluate effects of periodontal therapy [SRP,&#xD;
      metronidazole (MET) and oral hygiene instructions (OHI)] through three-arm trial experiment&#xD;
      comprising of SRP+MET+OHI, SRP+OHI and OHI+ Delayed Therapy (DT) groups on HbA1c, FBG, FPI&#xD;
      levels and Insulin Resistance calculated through Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) to&#xD;
      fill research gap. This study will target large number of individuals (N &gt; 1000) at trial&#xD;
      camps known as diabetes-periodontitis (Diab-Per) camps at three different campuses of Dow&#xD;
      University of Health Sciences hospitals to be screened for presence of signs and symptoms of&#xD;
      chronic periodontitis and type-2 diabetes Mellitus. The selected candidates will be referred&#xD;
      to the base camp for further evaluation to be enrolled in trial and recruit 150 participants&#xD;
      randomly allocated in each group (50 in each group). Post-therapy follow-up results will be&#xD;
      assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months to evaluate short and long term changes in status of CP, FBG,&#xD;
      FPI and HbA1c.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall evidence that CP has a role in the causal pathway of DM is yet limited and&#xD;
      inconsistent. Although intervention research has suggested that treating CP may improve&#xD;
      glycemic control and insulin resistance in Type-2 DM patients; yet there is limited data&#xD;
      concerning the effects of adjunct antibiotic therapy (AAT) in addition to scaling root&#xD;
      planning (SRP) in treating CP for long lasting results. Therefore, it is suggested that&#xD;
      further research with bigger samples must be undertaken for a successful periodontal therapy&#xD;
      that may help improve glycemic control at desired levels and long durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to evaluate the effects of periodontal therapy [SRP, metronidazole&#xD;
      (MET) and oral hygiene instructions (OHI)] through a three-arm trial comprising of&#xD;
      SRP+MET+OHI group, SRP+OHI group and OHI+ Delayed Therapy (DT) group, on HbA1c, FBG, FPI&#xD;
      levels and Insulin Resistance calculated through Homeostasis Model Assessment (HOMA-IR) to&#xD;
      fill the research gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parallel group, single blind three-arm design randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be&#xD;
      conducted over a period of approximately 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 1000 patients will be screened for CP with T2DM to recruit 150 participants for the&#xD;
      study. They will be randomly allocated in each group (with 50 in each group). Post-therapy&#xD;
      follow-up will be for 1, 3 and 6 months to evaluate short term and long term changes in&#xD;
      status of CP, FBG, FPI and HbA1c respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured screening form will be used to collect baseline information. HbA1c, FBG levels and&#xD;
      IL will be recorded at standardized lab, whereas, CP will be evaluated using standardized&#xD;
      periodontal indices by calibrated examiners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stata version 11.0 will be used for all kind of data management. Descriptive analysis will be&#xD;
      performed using frequency percentages of the categorical variables whereas, mean (standard&#xD;
      deviation) will be calculated for all continuous study variables. Inferential statistics will&#xD;
      include Chi-square test to assess proportional differences of the categorical variables&#xD;
      between the three interventional groups. Whereas, one-way Analysis of Variance test (ANOVA)&#xD;
      will be used to evaluate the mean differences of the continuous variables in three different&#xD;
      groups. McNemar's Chi-square and Repeated Measure Analysis of Variance (RMANOVA) will be used&#xD;
      to assess differences in categorical and continuous variables respectively over time for each&#xD;
      intervention group; and particularly to assess second secondary study objective. For insulin&#xD;
      resistance HOMA-IR will be calculated to assess an association between CP and insulin&#xD;
      resistance.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This multi-centric randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be conducted on the baseline sample derived from periodontal clinics of dental institutes of Dow University of Health Sciences. More than 1000 patients will be screened to recruit 150 calculated sample participants (with 50 in each group) with reference to 0.7%, 0.6% reduction and no reduction (0.06%) in the baseline mean HbA1c over a period of 3 months among SRP+AAT, SRP Only and no treatment groups respectively(48) the calculated sample size is 35 in each group (1:1:1) with 99% power of test and 99% confidence interval. Adding 40% dropout rate expected over 6-months follow-up, 49 participants in each group will be required that will be rounded off to 50 in each group (with a ratio of 1:1:1).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>The participants in this group will receive a combination of ultrasonic scaling and hand instrumentation required for planing of the root surfaces (SRP) followed by systemic AAT followed by routine warm salt water rinses for 3-5 days and OHI. SRP will be performed using ultrasonic scaling device at medium intensity. In addition to ultrasonic scalar, hand instrumentation (using sharpened and sterilized curettes) may also be used if required to smoothen certain irregular areas of root surface until the surfaces are smooth. Systemic AAT would contain Metronidazole (MET) 400 mg x 3 for 10 days. OHI would include brushing teeth using soft bristles toothbrush and fluoridated toothpaste twice daily (morning after breakfast and night before sleeping) using Modified Bass Technique.</description>
