    <textblock>
      Obesity is currently considered an increasingly more severe social and health related&#xD;
      problem. The World Health Organization qualified obesity as a chronic disease along with&#xD;
      circulatory diseases, diabetes, cancer and respiratory diseases. The principal physiological&#xD;
      methods of treatment for this disease are diet and exercise. The aim of the study is assess&#xD;
      anhtropometric parameters, metabolic and proteomic profile and respiratory truck function in&#xD;
      obese patients reducing body weight during 21 days course of calorie restriction and physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;

      THE AIM OF THE STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining changes in anthropometric parameters, both the protein and metabolic profile as&#xD;
      well as changes in the respiratory system functional testing in obese patients, in whom an&#xD;
      attempt to reduce body mass (through dietary treatment and physical activity), under&#xD;
      controlled conditions (over a period of a 21-day hospitalization) was made.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH METHODOLOGY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted on a group of a 100 persons with obesity who fulfilled the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria (index BMI&gt;30 kg/m2/ and an increased adipose tissue content assessed by&#xD;
      the electrical bioimpedance method)&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH PLAN&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The research will include studies conducted in The Department and Clinic of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, Dietetics and Internal Medicine in Poznan, performed by members of the&#xD;
      research team, before and after a 21-day weight loss cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The assessment of anthropometric parameters (height, body mass, BMI, the waist and hip&#xD;
           circumference, the WHR index) and the assessment of the body adipose tissue content&#xD;
           using the electrical bioimpedance method, with TANITA MC-980 MA TANITA AB140 ViScan&#xD;
           device).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The detailed medical history, considering other parameters that may influence an&#xD;
           increase in body mass, based on a detailed specially prepared questionnaire (regarding&#xD;
           disease history, socio-economical data and eating habits).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Objective and subjective assessment, systolic and diastolic blood pressure measurement&#xD;
           (two-time measurement with the sphygmomanometer using the Korotkow method, in a sitting&#xD;
           position, after a 5 minute rest), as well as a systolic and diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
           measurement in reaction to verticalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters will be assessed in a study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Lipid parameters (the total cholesterol density, HDL fraction, LDL and the triglycerides&#xD;
           in the serum) using the enzymatic method. The HDL cholesterol will be calculated based&#xD;
           on the following formula: nonHDL cholesterol = total cholesterol - HDL fraction&#xD;
           cholesterol and the ratio TG/HDL will be calculated as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inflammatory response markers assessment, OB and CRP, using a standard method&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Liver function assessment (ALT, AST, GGTP) using a standard method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Kidney function assessment (the creatinine concentration in the serum including the&#xD;
           estimated indicator of glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) according to the Modification&#xD;
           of Diet Renal Disease Study Equation (MDRD) norm: 90-120ml/min/1,73 m². CChN will be&#xD;
           classified according to the estimated indicator of glomerular filtration rate: stage G1&#xD;
           (eGFR≥90 ml/min/1,73 m²), stage G2 (eGFR 60-89 ml/min/1,73 m²), stage G3a (eGFR45-59&#xD;
           ml/min/1,73 m²), stage G3b (eGFR30-45 ml/min/1,73 m²) stage G4 (eGFR 5-29 ml/min/1,73&#xD;
           m²) and stage G5 (eGFR&lt;15 ml/min/1,73 m² or dialysis treatment). [1] The plan is to&#xD;
           assess, within the study group, the albumin/creatinine index in a morning urine sample.&#xD;
           The value of the albumin/creatinine index&gt;30mg/g will be considered positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The evaluation of markers: alfa-fetoprotein, Ca19,9, CEA using a standard method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the patients will be asked to fill out additional questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Questionnaire evaluating the eating behavior and opinion on food and nutrition (QEB) and&#xD;
           a Physical activity questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Questionnaires assessing the quality of sleep: (Athens Insomnia Scale and Pittsburgh&#xD;
           Sleep Quality Index (PSQI).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sleep apnea scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Psychological surveys: Multidimensional Health Locus and Control Scale (MHLC),&#xD;
           Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), Acceptance of Illness Scale (AIS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Additionally for patients with accompanying diabetes: Problem Areas in Diabetes (PAID)&#xD;
           Diabetes Treatment Questionnaire (DTSQ) II. 21-day stay in the Greater Poland&#xD;
           Pulmonology and Thoracic Surgery Centre, The Department of Pulmonology and&#xD;
           Rehabilitation (Unit in Ludwikowo near Poznan)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indications for hospitalization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obesity disenabling professional work and social function performing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Necessity of body mass reduction to improve lipid parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sleep disorder caused by excess body mass (sleep apnea syndrome)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pre-diabetes or diabetes related to accompanying obesity&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Osteoarticular system disorders related to obesity disenabling the execution of planned&#xD;
           orthopedic procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following will be conducted on subjects of the study during hospitalization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A 21-day body mass reduction attempt will be implemented under sanatorial conditions. A&#xD;
           rational hypo-calorie diet will be applied to all patients (calorie reduction&#xD;
           proportional to the BMR calculated into actual body mass, macro-elements: 15-20%&#xD;
           protein, 25-30% fat, 50-55% carbohydrates, simple sugar content &lt;5%, dietary fiber 30g)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Throughout a period of the weight loss program the following will be implemented:&#xD;
           standard motor rehabilitation - kinesitherapy (2 x a day for 25 minutes), stationary&#xD;
           bike training (1x a day for 10 minutes) as well as passive mechanical exercises (1x a&#xD;
           day for 15 minutes), abdominal muscle exercises (1x a day with an increasing, by 10,&#xD;
           number of repetitions starting with 30).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Every patient will also take two physiotherapeutic treatments recommended by a&#xD;
           physiotherapist (laser, ultrasounds, TENS, magnetic field, iontophoresis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The following respiratory system tests will be conducted before the beginning as well as&#xD;
           on the 21-st day of the weight loss cycle: arterial blood gasometry, spirometry,&#xD;
           ergospirometry, body plethysmography, diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon dioxide&#xD;
           (DLCO).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Furthermore, on the starting day of the program as well as after 21 days, the&#xD;
           measurement of neck circumference and neck adipose tissue will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Each patient, who will be taking part in the study, will be educated in the aspect of&#xD;
           correct nutrition and rational reduction diet rules (3 meetings -30 minutes each,&#xD;
           conducted at 7 day intervals).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Furthermore, the oxidative stress parameters and the inflammatory response markers will&#xD;
           be evaluated both at the beginning and at the end of the hospitalization period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. The assessment of amino acid concentration and the metabolic profile evaluation will be&#xD;
      performed in the Department of Inorganic and Analytical Chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluation of the protein profile will be performed using the mass spectrometer MALDI&#xD;
           ToF/ToF,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The serous amino acid concentration will be performed using the mass spectrometer QTRAP&#xD;
           4000)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The Biocrates AbsolutelDQ p180 Kit will be used to evaluate the metabolic panel&#xD;
           (glycerolophospholipids, sphingolipids).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Venous blood, in the amount of 20 ml will be used in order to assess parameters listed&#xD;
           above. Determination of the above parameters will be performed twice, before and after&#xD;
           the end of each stage (40 ml of venous blood will be sampled from each patient&#xD;
           throughout the duration of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. The evaluation of hormones released by the muscle and adipose tissue, the concentration&#xD;
      of free oxygen radicals, and the total oxidation capacity in plasma will be assessed from&#xD;
      blood samples obtained at the beginning and at the end of the 21 day study period in The&#xD;
