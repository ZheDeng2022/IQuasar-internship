    <textblock>
      Red blood cells contain a chemical called haemoglobin which carries oxygen from the lungs&#xD;
      around the body. When the amount of haemoglobin is reduced, a patient is 'anaemic'. Anaemia&#xD;
      can have many causes, but affects about a third of patients having major surgery in hospital.&#xD;
      After their operation these anaemic patients are more likely to suffer serious complications.&#xD;
      This may be because the body needs extra oxygen - and so enough haemoglobin - to heal and&#xD;
      recover successfully from the trauma of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a similar reason, patients' overall fitness before surgery is very important. Less fit&#xD;
      patients are much more likely to get complications after surgery. To help us assess the risk&#xD;
      of complications, the investigators measure patients' fitness before surgery using a cycling&#xD;
      exercise test. The investigators monitor a number of things that show us how well the heart,&#xD;
      the lungs and the muscles respond when they are under stress. People who are very anaemic&#xD;
      tend to perform less well on this cycling test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anaemia is often due to a lack of iron, which helps make haemoglobin. Usually people get iron&#xD;
      from foods such as red meat and spinach. Some conditions mean that patients lose iron, such&#xD;
      as a tumour bleeding. Other illnesses make it difficult for the body to absorb iron from the&#xD;
      gut in the first place. Both lead to a state of low iron in the body and eventually this&#xD;
      leads to anaemia. One way to treat anaemia quickly before surgery is to give iron into the&#xD;
      bloodstream (intra-venous). It is thought that this might reduce the risk of complications&#xD;
      after surgery, but it is not known whether this is because it improves overall fitness, or&#xD;
      for other reasons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to carry out a study called CAPOEIRA-I (CArdio PulmOnary Exercise&#xD;
      testing and IntRAvenous Iron) to find out whether giving patients intravenous iron improves&#xD;
      their fitness. The investigators will measure this by doing a cycle exercise test before and&#xD;
      then at least 10 days after the iron is given. The investigators will also measure how much&#xD;
      the total amount of haemoglobin chnages with iron treatment. Intravenous iron is already&#xD;
      routinely used for these patients, so the only additional activity for the study is the extra&#xD;
      exercise test, some extra blood tests and the measurement of haemoglobin after the iron has&#xD;
      taken effect.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia is common in the elective surgical population, a prevalence of around 30% being&#xD;
      consistently reported in large cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiopulmonary exercise testing (CPET), which provides an objective assessment of aerobic&#xD;
      fitness by measuring oxygen consumption (O2) and carbon dioxide production is widely&#xD;
      considered the gold standard assessment of functional capacity as it dynamically tests the&#xD;
      pulmonary, cardiovascular and musculoskeletal system and their interplay in a single test.&#xD;
      CPET parameters are affected by a number of patient factors including effort, ability to turn&#xD;
      the pedals on an exercise bike, pulmonary function, and crucially oxygen delivery to the&#xD;
      respiring tissues, which is dependent on blood oxygen content and flow to the tissues via&#xD;
      cardiac output.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oxygen carrying capacity of arterial blood is largely influenced by the haemoglobin&#xD;
      content (or total haemoglobin mass (tHb-mass)). tHb-mass affects CPET performance to a&#xD;
      greater degree than haemoglobin concentration ([Hb]). [Hb] is dependent on plasma volume (PV)&#xD;
      and shows a greater fluctuation day to day than tHb-mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies in athletes show the detrimental affect of blood volume loss (i.e. deliberate&#xD;
      venesection) and haemoglobin content loss on CPET performance. The corollary of this is&#xD;
      illegal blood manipulation, which improves CPET performance. The same is seen post altitude&#xD;
      training camps with increased tHb-mass leading to improved maximal exercise performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aerobic capacity is defined as the maximum amount of oxygen that can be consumed by the body&#xD;
      per unit time and is the gold standard measure of physical fitness. VO2max is classically&#xD;
      defined as 'a plateau in oxygen uptake attained during maximal exercise despite further&#xD;
      increases in exercise workload, thereby defining the limits of the cardiorespiratory system'.&#xD;
      However, many individuals do not reach a plateau in oxygen uptake despite maximum exertion,&#xD;
      and the term VO2peak is used instead. This is the highest measured oxygen consumption during&#xD;
      exercise and is typically averaged over a 30 second period. O2 at anaerobic threshold (VO2AT)&#xD;
      is defined as: 'the highest sustained intensity of exercise for which the measurement of&#xD;
      oxygen uptake can account for the entire energy requirement.' An alternative definition is&#xD;
      'the exercise intensity at which lactate starts to accumulate in the blood stream above&#xD;
      rest'. These oxygen uptake variables are in part dependent on the oxygen carrying capacity of&#xD;
      the blood, which is in turn dependent on blood haemoglobin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major surgery places an increased metabolic demand on the body. Perhaps for this reason, both&#xD;
      lower preoperative VO2peak and VO2AT values are associated with increased morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality after major surgery. Much of the literature in this area is derived from studies&#xD;
      reporting CPET variables. Given that the oxygen uptake variables VO2peak and VO2AT are&#xD;
      positively correlated with tHb-mass, it may be that some of the physical fitness-outcome&#xD;
      relationship is mediated through haemoglobin-related effects rather than cardiorespiratory&#xD;
      function, providing a mechanistic basis to poor CPET performance in many patients with&#xD;
      anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few studies have examined the impact of blood manipulation - either transfusion or iron&#xD;
      therapy - on CPET variables in patients. A study by Wright et al examined 20 patients with&#xD;
      chronic anaemia due to 'stable haematological conditions' requiring blood transfusions. A&#xD;
      CPET was performed before the blood transfusion and repeated 2-6 days after the transfusion&#xD;
      of 1-4 units of blood (median 3). A mean rise in [Hb] from 8.3-11.2 g dl-1 was associated&#xD;
      with a mean (SD) rise in O2AT from 10.4 (2.4) to 11.6 (2.5) mlkg-1min -1, (p= 0.018). (10).&#xD;
      When corrected for the change in Hb concentration, the anaerobic threshold increased by a&#xD;
      mean (SD) of 0.39 (0.74) ml kg-1 min-1 per g dl-1 Hb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results were consistent with a study in patients with beta thalassaemia major that&#xD;
      compared exercise performance before, and 2 hours after haemotransfusion. Exercise duration&#xD;
      increased from 7.3 (+/- 2.8) to 10.3 (+/- 2.3) minutes (p&lt;0.05), and O2 peak increased from&#xD;
      28.5 (+/- 5.0) to 36.2 (+/- 7.1) ml kg-1min-1; (p&lt;0.05).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measuring haemoglobin concentration vs. total haemoglobin mass&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditionally, the concentration of circulating haemoglobin [Hb] has been used as a clinical&#xD;
      measure of the blood's oxygen carrying capacity. However, a low [Hb] may be due to a reduced&#xD;
      amount of haemoglobin (absolute mass of circulating haemoglobin; tHb-mass) or an increased&#xD;
      volume of dilution (plasma volume). Thus, [Hb] may be stable and tHb-mass low in the context&#xD;
      of acute bleeding, [Hb] normal or elevated but tHb-mass low in the context of dehydration, or&#xD;
      [Hb] low but tHb-mass normal or high in the context of excess plasma volume (fluid).&#xD;
      Therefore, the use of [Hb] to define blood oxygen carrying capacity may be misleading under&#xD;
      some circumstances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tHb-mass represents the absolute mass of circulating haemoglobin in the body, the measured&#xD;
      [Hb] being dependent upon tHb-mass and blood volume (BV) (sum of plasma volume (PV) and total&#xD;
      red cell volume]). The proportion of oxygen carried in solution in plasma is trivial (0.3 ml&#xD;
      per 100 ml of plasma) under normal physiological conditions, whereas each gram of Hb binds up&#xD;
      to 1.39 mL of oxygen. Thus, tHb-mass is the principal determinant of total blood O2-carrying&#xD;
      capacity and may provide additional information regarding the clinical status of patients&#xD;
      than that provided by [Hb] alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, a recently developed blood test capable of estimating absolute vascular&#xD;
      volumes may be applied as a direct test to correct for any plasma volume fluctuations&#xD;
      influencing a [Hb] value. As the model requires only a simple blood sample it may be a&#xD;
      suitable alternative to estimate vascular volumes (and tHb-mass) if the patient is unable to&#xD;
      perform the oCOR technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classification of anaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The terminology around the classification of anaemia can be complex. There is no single&#xD;
      laboratory parameter comprehensively reflecting the overall iron status of an individual. The&#xD;
      POAS pathway used at UHS simplifies this (Appendix 1). In the perioperative period there are&#xD;
      a number of possible causes of iron-related anaemia:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iron deficiency: Ferritin &lt;30 g,l-1&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iron deficiency and functional iron deficiency (FID) (ferritin 30-100g.l-1 with TSAT&#xD;
           &lt;20% and a CRP &gt;5.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Iron restriction/deplete Ferritin 30-100 with TSAT &gt;20% or CRP raised/normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If Ferritin is &gt;100g,l-1 cause of anaemia could be non iron deficient anaemia or FID&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional iron deficiency: insufficient iron incorporation into erythroid precursors&#xD;
           despite apparently adequate body iron stores. Recognised by the presence of stainable&#xD;
           iron in the bone marrow, with a normal serum ferritin value,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anaemia of chronic inflammation: functional iron deficiency caused by chronic&#xD;
           inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A blood film is useful to detect iron deficiency alongside FID to determine which&#xD;
           patients may benefit from iron therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have defined how anaemia is classified and who would be eligible for&#xD;
      intravenous iron therapy based on international consensus and local hospital guidelines.&#xD;
      Patients who do not fall into the clear groups of iron deficiency, iron repletion or&#xD;
      functional iron deficiency as per the POAS guidance are not suitable for intravenous iron and&#xD;
      will not be eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research statement&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative anaemia is common, and is associated with poorer outcomes after major surgery.&#xD;
      Impaired physical performance, as assessed by CPET, is likewise associated with impaired&#xD;
      outcomes, and may be partly due to pre-operative anaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators wish to test the feasibility of performing a CPET test then administering&#xD;
      intravenous iron and repeating a CPET prior to surgery in patients being considered for&#xD;
      elective surgery. The investigators want to find out if treating anaemic patients who are&#xD;
      suitable for intravenous iron therapy affects their CPET variables. This will help to inform&#xD;
      further work to see if intravenous iron therapy combined with CPET adjusted risk&#xD;
      stratification improves morbidity and/or mortality for anaemic patients undergoing major&#xD;
      elective surgery.&#xD;
