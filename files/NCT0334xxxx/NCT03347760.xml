  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infectious myocarditis are frequent, most of the time viral and can evolve to cardiac&#xD;
      insufficiency. The diagnosis is difficult because they can mime an acute coronary syndrome.&#xD;
      Approximately 10 % of patients with acute infarction suspected, have a normal angiography,&#xD;
      and half of them has in fact a myocarditis, as showed studies of cardiac MRI among which some&#xD;
      realized in our department . However, anomalies observed in MRI are not specific and it is&#xD;
      necessary to use multiple criterions. A new radiopharmaceutical, the 68Ga-DOTATOC, specific&#xD;
      of somatostatin's receptors which are over expressed by the inflammatory cells, has recently&#xD;
      showed the capacity to identify myocarditis, but only in a small group of 6 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators make assumptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. this radiopharmaceutical is enough sensitive to detect most of the acute inflammatory&#xD;
           myocarditis which are identified by the MRI and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. it could maybe allow to identify myocarditis with a persistent subacute or chronic&#xD;
           inflammation, which are difficult to identify with cardiac MRI, and it would be a new&#xD;
           information able to guide the medical decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectif: to determine if PET with 68Ga-DOTATOC is enough sensitive to identify&#xD;
      myocarditis in acute inflammatory phase by hospitalized patients with suspected acute&#xD;
      infarction and with normal angiography and who have a high probability of myocarditis&#xD;
      identified by MRI. Disease prevalence will be close to 100 % at baseline Secondary&#xD;
      objectives: 1. Estimate the frequency of inflammatory forms (subacute or chronicle), with a&#xD;
      68Ga-DOTATOC PET at 3 to 5 months from baseline, when classic signs of acute inflammatory&#xD;
      generally disappeared (CRP, Troponin-I, myocardial oedema in MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Analyze the concordance of the results of 68Ga-DOTATOC TEP by two readers&#xD;
