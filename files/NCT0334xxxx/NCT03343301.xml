  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center study to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics (PD) of FPA144 in combination with 5-fluorouracil, leucovorin and&#xD;
      oxaliplatin (mFOLFOX6) for patients with gastrointestinal malignancies (GI). The phase 1 open&#xD;
      label safety run-in will identify a recommended dose of FPA144 to use in the phase 3 portion&#xD;
      of the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1 is an open-label dose-escalation of FPA144 in combination with mFOLFOX6. Eligible&#xD;
      patients will have unresectable locally advanced or metastatic GI cancer of any type and be&#xD;
      candidates to receive at least 2 doses of mFOLFOX6 chemotherapy. FGFR2 status is not a&#xD;
      requirement for enrollment. FGFR2 status will be tested retrospectively by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry (IHC) if tissue is available and a sample will be obtained for&#xD;
      circulating tumor deoxynucleic acid (ctDNA) blood assay. Phase 1 consists of at least 2&#xD;
      dosing cohorts of FPA144 in combination with mFOLFOX6 to determine the recommended dose of&#xD;
      FPA144 in combination with mFOLFOX6 in the phase 3.&#xD;
