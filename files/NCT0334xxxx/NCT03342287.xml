  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Irritable Bowel syndrome - constipation predominant (IBS-C) is a chronic and&#xD;
      disabling,disorder of the gut that is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort.&#xD;
      Approximately 50% of patients with IBS-C will also meet criteria for anxiety or depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anti depressant medication is widely used in the treatment of IBS. Linaclotide is a novel&#xD;
      medication for IBS that is also effective at relieving pain associated with IBS, which may be&#xD;
      in part to signalling between the gut and the brain. However, the impact of Linaclotide on&#xD;
      the psychiatric symptoms of anxiety and depression on IBS has not been investigated.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic, disabling functional gastrointestinal disorder&#xD;
      that is characterized by abdominal pain or discomfort and a disturbance in bowel habit. It&#xD;
      has long been recognized that psychological factors can be important in IBS, and that&#xD;
      bi-directional signaling between the gut and the brain is likely involved in the&#xD;
      pathophysiology of the syndrome. Approximately 50% of patients with IBS at a tertiary center&#xD;
      will also meet criteria for anxiety or depression. Anti-depressant medications are widely&#xD;
      used in the treatment of IBS, even without psychiatric comorbidity, with good evidence for&#xD;
      both tricyclic antidepressants and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Unfortunately&#xD;
      both classes of anti-depressants have significant gastrointestinal side effects and a large&#xD;
      number of patients cannot tolerate the medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Linaclotide, a guanylate cyclase agonist, has emerged as an important, novel treatment for&#xD;
      patients with constipation-predominant IBS (IBS-C) and Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC).&#xD;
      Linaclotide is effective at relieving pain associated with IBS, which may be in part mediated&#xD;
      by modulation of signaling between the gut and the brain. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      will study the effect of Linaclotide on anxiety, depression and cognitive functioning in&#xD;
      patients with IBS-C and CIC. If Linaclotide is also effective in treating anxiety and&#xD;
      depression and improving cognitive functioning in patients with IBS-C and CIC, this will be&#xD;
      an important therapeutic advance for the 50% of IBS patients with psychiatric comorbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also propose to investigate the mechanisms by which Linaclotide may effect&#xD;
      psychiatric symptoms and neuropsychological functioning by measuring changes in the gut&#xD;
      microbiome and inflammatory biomarkers. The gut and the brain are intimately connected by&#xD;
      several, bidirectional, signaling pathways including neural, humoral and immune mechanisms.&#xD;
      The concept of the &quot;gut-brain axis&quot; has recently been supplanted by the &quot;microbiota-gut-brain&#xD;
      axis,&quot; emphasizing the important role the gut microbiota plays in mediating brain responses.&#xD;
      The gut microbiota communicate with the brain through immune and neuronal pathways and some&#xD;
      microbiota can directly secrete neurotransmitters such as serotonin, dopamine and&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) . In true bidirectional fashion, the brain can also influence&#xD;
      the microbiota through the secretion of cortisol and sympathetic neurotransmission, changing&#xD;
      gut motility, secretion and mucin production, which can affect the habitat of the resident&#xD;
      microbiota and thereby alter the composition of the microbiota. Alterations in gut microbiota&#xD;
      have been associated with irritable bowel syndrome in multiple studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the importance of the gut microbiota in mediating gut-brain responses, the&#xD;
      investigators propose that the gut microbiota may play a direct role in the pathophysiology&#xD;
      of anxiety and depression in patients with IBS. If Linaclotide is effective in reducing&#xD;
      psychiatric and neuropsychological symptoms in patients with IBS, this may occur through&#xD;
      changes in the gut microbiota, perhaps as a result of altered colonic motility and altered&#xD;
      habitat of resident microbiota.&#xD;
