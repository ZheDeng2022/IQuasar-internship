  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic means that the cancer has spread beyond the breast. In addition, through&#xD;
           genetic testing of the blood or tumor, an altered gene has been found that suggests the&#xD;
           tumor may not be able to repair its genetic material (DNA) when it becomes damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This aspect of the cancer may cause it to be more sensitive - that is, more effectively&#xD;
           killed by certain types of drugs such as the study agent being evaluated in this trial,&#xD;
           Olaparib.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Olaparib is a type of drug known as a PARP inhibitor. Some types of breast cancer&#xD;
                and ovarian cancer share some basic features that make them sensitive to similar&#xD;
                treatments. Information from those other research studies suggests that this drug&#xD;
                may help to treat metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  This study will evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer&#xD;
                     patients whose tumor has a mutation in one of the other genes that function&#xD;
                     with BRCA1 and BRCA2 to repair damaged DNA .This mutation may have been&#xD;
                     inherited from a parent, or may have developed only in the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  This study will also evaluate whether olaparib is effective in breast cancer&#xD;
                     patients whose tumor has a mutation in BRCA1 or BRCA2 that was acquired by the&#xD;
                     tumor, but not inherited.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the&#xD;
           safety and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in&#xD;
           treating a specific cancer. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the study drug, Olaparib, is&#xD;
           being studied for use in this setting and the research doctors are trying to learn more&#xD;
           about it-the side effects it may cause and if the drug is effective in treating this&#xD;
           type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is a DNA repair gene mutation?&#xD;
&#xD;
           -- In order to survive, all cells, even cancer cells, must be able to repair their&#xD;
           genetic material (DNA) when it gets damaged. A mutation is an alteration or change in a&#xD;
           gene- either inherited from a parent or acquired over time- that prevents the gene from&#xD;
           working properly. Faulty genes (or genes that carry a mutation) have been linked to&#xD;
           increased risk of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  What is Olaparib?&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Olaparib is a drug that may stop cancer cells from growing. Olaparib is a PARP&#xD;
                inhibitor which means that it blocks an enzyme (proteins that help chemical&#xD;
                reactions in the body occur) in cells called PARP. PARP helps repair DNA when it&#xD;
                becomes damaged. It has been shown that the tumors in individuals who have&#xD;
                inherited or acquired a mutation in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes are often sensitive to&#xD;
                killing by PARP inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  In normal cells and many other tumors, repair of damage to the DNA requires&#xD;
                pathways of genes that work with BRCA1 and BRCA2. Therefore, when a drug that&#xD;
                inhibits PARP from working is given to people with a BRCA mutation, or a defect in&#xD;
                another gene that works with BRCA1 and BRCA2, both ways of repairing damaged DNA no&#xD;
                longer work. The combined effect of knocking out both DNA repair mechanisms is so&#xD;
                severe that the cancer cells could die. This might stop the growth of type of&#xD;
                breast cancer, but this is not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The FDA (U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has approved Olaparib for use in&#xD;
                advanced ovarian cancer with a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation. Olaparib is not approved&#xD;
                for breast cancer.&#xD;

                  the discretion of Dr. Tung with the key study collaborators (see details below in&#xD;
                  italics). (Cohorts 1 or 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  --- OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Documented somatic mutation (deleterious or suspected deleterious) in BRCA1 or&#xD;
                  BRCA2 through any CLIA approved lab only if in addition to the lack of a germline&#xD;
                  BRCA1/2 mutation is demonstrated through a CLIA approved lab. Patients with&#xD;
                  germline mutations in BRCA1/2 are NOT eligible for this study. (Cohort 2 only)&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Cohort 2a: somatic mutation of BRCA 1 or BRCA 2&#xD;
&#xD;
             -- The mutation must be identified through a CLIA-approved NGS panel. Mutations must&#xD;

&#xD;
             -- NOTE: If the only site of measurable of disease has been previously irradiated,&#xD;

                  hypersensitivity or neuropathy) but had not progressed on that regimen, or if a&#xD;
                  prior chemotherapy regimen was discontinued after response achieved, it will not&#xD;

             (DCIS); Stage 1, grade 1 endometrial carcinoma; or, other solid tumors including&#xD;
             lymphomas (without bone marrow involvement) curatively treated with no evidence of&#xD;
             disease for ≥5 years&#xD;
