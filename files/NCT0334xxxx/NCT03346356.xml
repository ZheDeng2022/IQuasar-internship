  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In close collaboration with the Nevada County 4-H Youth Development Program, the Shaping&#xD;
      Healthy Choices Program was implemented utilizing 4-H teenagers as cross-age teachers for&#xD;
      younger youth. The 4-H Youth Development Program is an education program of the University of&#xD;
      California Cooperative Extension that emphasizes learning citizenship, leadership, and life&#xD;
      skills. The program creates positive opportunities for youth to learn, develop skills, and&#xD;
      become engaged in their local communities. This is accomplished with combined efforts of&#xD;
      youth, volunteer leaders, and University staff and faculty through a fun, hands-on learning&#xD;
      approach to non-formal education. As a requirement to participate in the program, all youth&#xD;
      had to enroll in 4-H for the 2016-2017 year. Teenagers were initially trained in&#xD;
      inquiry-based and experiential learning techniques before facilitating the program. Teenage&#xD;
      teachers collectively lead classroom education, garden activities, and cooking&#xD;
      demonstrations. Additionally, teenage teachers, UC Cooperative Extension staff, and UC Davis&#xD;
      students organized and implemented a community health fair for elementary-aged children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements were taken on nutrition knowledge, vegetables preferences, civic responsibility,&#xD;
      program fidelity, and self-efficacy for teaching nutrition. A parent interview was also&#xD;
      conducted to gauge parental engagement and perception of whether their child had behavior&#xD;
      changes while participating in the program. Preliminary findings from the parent interview&#xD;
      show that children were more likely to support and engage in healthy eating practices&#xD;
      throughout their involvement than they had before the program. Children also have expressed&#xD;
      interests in continuing their participation in subsequent years. All other data for this&#xD;
      intervention are currently undergoing analyses.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Change in baseline vegetable preferences for teaching nutrition at post-intervention approximately 6 months later</time_frame>
    <description>Vegetables Preferences task involves displaying a whole vegetable as well as a sample of the vegetable for six different vegetables. One-on-one with a research assistant, youth are asked whether they can name the vegetable and a series of application and qualitative questions about that vegetable. This measurement was only used with the younger youth participants.</description>

    <description>After the initial training, the teenage teachers facilitated the curricula associated with the SHCP, Discovering Healthy Choices and Cooking Up Healthy Choices, approximately twice a month. The curricula can be viewed at http://cns.ucdavis.edu/programs/shcp/curriculum.html. Each activity provided step-by-step instructions that the teenage teachers were asked to follow. Younger youth served as participants for the classroom and garden-based activities.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The research team will recruit and consent youth study participants and their parents&#xD;
             from members of the Nevada County 4-H Youth Development Program. Youth study&#xD;
             participants must be ages 14-18 for teenage teachers and 8-13 for younger youth&#xD;
             participants. Study participants must be able to attend two-hour bimonthly meetings at&#xD;
             the 4-H office and/or (depending on the activity) Food Bank garden in Grass Valley,&#xD;
             California. Teenage teachers will also be required to complete ten hours of initial&#xD;
             training before the start of SHCP implementation. All participants will be required to&#xD;
             join the Nevada County 4-H Youth Development Program if they are not already a member.&#xD;
             Teenage teachers' registration fees will be paid for by the research team. Comparison&#xD;
