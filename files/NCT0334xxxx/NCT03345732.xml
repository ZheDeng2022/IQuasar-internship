  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Wound complications, such as salivary-cutaneous fistulas and skin necrosis, result in&#xD;
      significant patient morbidity and death. Head and neck wounds are complicated because of&#xD;
      multiple tissue layers, critical structures and variable vascularity. When vascularity is&#xD;
      compromised, wounds do not heal and can lead to life threatening haemorrhage or morbid&#xD;
      infections. The field of microsurgical reconstruction has developed and expanded over the&#xD;
      last 20 years to specifically ameliorate these issues. The challenge is that the vascularity&#xD;
      of the microsurgical transplant or the recipient tissue bed can have areas of decreased&#xD;
      vascularity that cannot be appreciated by the surgeon's intraoperative exam alone. Surgeons&#xD;
      would be able to make better decisions with respect to the vascularity if there was an&#xD;
      imaging technique that could indicate the vascular supply of the tissues undergoing surgical&#xD;
      reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laser-assisted indocyanine green fluorescent dye angiography (LA-ICG) using the SPY System&#xD;
      (Novadaq Technologies Inc., Richmond, British Columbia, Canada) is an intraoperative vascular&#xD;
      imaging technique that improves the ability of a surgeon to assess the vascular supply in the&#xD;
      surgical bed. This tool, which is approved by Health Canada for reconstructive surgery, has&#xD;
      been used extensively in breast reconstruction and gastrointestinal procedures with&#xD;
      encouraging results. The ability to address ischemic tissues intraoperatively could&#xD;
      potentially decrease the rate of devastating wound complications in head and neck surgery&#xD;
      patients. The objective of this observational study is to assess the effectiveness of LA-ICG&#xD;
      in head and neck reconstructive procedures to reduce the rate of skin necrosis and fistula.&#xD;

      This is a prospective, observational study in patients undergoing head and neck surgery with&#xD;
      reconstruction. Patients will be identified preoperatively by the participating surgeons.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be &gt;18 years of age with head and neck oncologic or traumatic&#xD;
      reconstructive needs requiring surgical reconstruction of the soft tissues or bony structures&#xD;
      of the head and neck who consent to use of ICG and the SPY System intraoperatively. Defect&#xD;
      types to be included in the study are any hypopharyngeal defect (i.e. Total laryngectomy,&#xD;
      total laryngectomy with partial pharyngectomy), tracheal defects, oral cavity defects at risk&#xD;
      for devascularized mucosa, or large skin defects requiring rotation-advancement flaps for&#xD;
      closure. Donor types to be included are pedicled locoregional muscle flaps including&#xD;
      pectoralis muscle flaps, cervicofacial skin advancement flaps, infrascapular and&#xD;
      suprascapular flaps, and any free flap used to reconstruct the defects mentioned previously.&#xD;
