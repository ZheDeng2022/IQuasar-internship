    <measure>Efficacy of Wilate or Nuwiq in achieving complete or partial immune tolerance induction (ITI) success in moderate and severe haemophilia A patients with inhibitors</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>ITI success will be determined using predefined success criteria to analyze the proportion of patients achieving complete or partial ITI success. Complete success is defined by achieving all of the following variables: 1) Inhibitor titre &lt;0.6BU (at least 2 separate blood samplings) assessed using the modified Bethesda assay; 2) Incremental in vivo recovery (IVR) of FVIII in the normal range (≥66% of normal); 3) FVIII half-life ≥6 hours Wilate or Nuwiq infusion. Partial success is defined as two of the three criteria being met, whilst partial response is defined as one of the three criteria being met. Partial failure is defined as none of the three criteria are met, but the inhibitor titre has decreased to &lt;5 BU; complete failure is defined as none of the three criteria are met, and the inhibitor titre is still ≥5 BU.</description>

    <measure>Time necessary to achieve complete or partial ITI success</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>Time to achieve complete or partial ITI success will be determined using predefined success criteria. Complete success is defined by achieving all of the following variables: 1) Inhibitor titre &lt;0.6 BU (at least 2 separate blood samplings) assessed using the modified Bethesda assay; 2) Incremental IVR of FVIII in the normal range (≥66% of normal) ; 3) FVIII half-life ≥6 hours. Wilate or Nuwiq infusion. Partial success is defined as two of the three criteria being met, whilst partial response is defined as one of the three criteria being met.

    <measure>Association of inhibitor titres with the probability of ITI success</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>Inhibitor titre will be assessed at the start of and throughout ITI treatment, including peak inhibitor titres, with the probability of ITI success.&#xD;
ITI success will be determined using predefined success criteria. Complete success is defined by achieving all of the following variables: 1) Inhibitor titre &lt;0.6 BU (at least 2 separate blood samplings) assessed using the modified Bethesda assay; 2) Incremental IVR of FVIII in the normal range (≥66% of normal) ; 3) FVIII half-life ≥6 hours. Wilate or Nuwiq infusion. Partial success is defined as two of the three criteria being met, whilst partial response is defined as one of the three criteria being met. Partial failure is defined as none of the three criteria are met, but the inhibitor titre has decreased to &lt;5 BU; complete failure is defined as none of the three criteria are met, and the inhibitor titre is still ≥5 BU.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Use of bypassing agents before and during ITI treatment with Wilate or Nuwiq</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months before the start of ITI with Wilate or Nuwiq to a maximum of 5 years from starting ITI with Wilate or Nuwiq</time_frame>
    <description>Use of bypassing agents is at the discretion of the Investigator, either to treat bleeding or to provide prophylactic therapy. As long as the patient's inhibitor level is ≥0.6 Bethesda units (BU), treatment of BEs may, in addition to FVIII treatment, require the administration of activated prothrombin complex concentrates (aPCC) or recombinant FVIIa.</description>

    <measure>Use of emicizumab (Hemlibra) during ITI treatment with Wilate or Nuwiq</measure>
    <time_frame>A maximum period of 5 years from ITI start</time_frame>
    <description>The dosing and frequency of emicizumab (Hemlibra) used is at the discretion of the Investigator. As a general guidance, the recommended dose is 3mg/kg once weekly for the first 4 weeks, followed by 1.5mg/kg once weekly, administered as a subcutaneous injection, as per the product monograph.</description>
