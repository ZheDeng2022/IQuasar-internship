  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, partial crossover, single-dose study to evaluate the pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      (PK), dose proportionality, and safety/tolerability of tablet versus capsule formulations of&#xD;
      KBP-5074 in healthy subjects. The study is designed to evaluate the PK of a new tablet&#xD;
      formulation versus that of the current capsule formulation. Data derived from this study, in&#xD;
      addition to preclinical data and chemistry, manufacturing, and controls, will provide a basis&#xD;
      for dose selection in future studies.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Twenty healthy subjects will be allocated 4:1 to either the crossover study groups (16&#xD;
      subjects) or to the 0.25 mg tablet single dose treatment (4 subjects). Subjects allocated to&#xD;
      the crossover study groups will be randomized 1:1 to 0.5 mg tablet/capsule (8 subjects) or&#xD;
      1.0 mg tablet/capsule (8 subjects).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the crossover study groups, subjects will be further randomized to receive a single&#xD;
      dose of KBP-5074 (0.5 mg or 1.0 mg) in either capsule or tablet formulation in a 2-period&#xD;
      crossover design with a 2-week washout period. The study duration for subjects in the&#xD;
      crossover study groups will be approximately 7 weeks, which includes a 3-week screening&#xD;
      period, and the 2 crossover single dose periods, which will be followed by a 2-week&#xD;
      washout/follow-up period, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects allocated to the 0.25 mg dose cohort (n=4) will receive a single dose of 0.25 mg in&#xD;
      tablet formulation only. The 0.25 mg tablet cohort will provide additional data for the&#xD;
      evaluation of dose exposure for the tablet formulation. The study duration for the single&#xD;
      dose arm will be 5 weeks, which includes a 3-week screening period, and the single dose which&#xD;
      will be followed by a 2 week washout period.&#xD;
