    <textblock>
      This study will determine if the combination of regorafenib and pembrolizumab is safe and&#xD;
      tolerated in patients with advanced liver cancer. In addition, the study will explore the&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity of this combination as well as potentially identifying blood and tissue&#xD;
      biomarkers associated with disease activity, status or response. The study will also&#xD;
      investigate how the drugs behave in your body&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients ≥ 18 years of age on day of signing informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histological or cytological confirmation of HCC (hepatocellular carcinoma) or&#xD;

             Diseases (AASLD) criteria in patients with a confirmed diagnosis of cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Barcelona Clinic Liver Cancer (BCLC) stage B or C that cannot benefit from treatments&#xD;
             of established efficacy such as resection, local ablation, chemoembolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Liver function status Child-Pugh (CP) Class A. CP status should be calculated based on&#xD;
             clinical findings and laboratory results during the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any local or loco-regional therapy of intrahepatic tumor lesions (e.g. surgery,&#xD;
             radiation therapy, hepatic arterial embolization, chemoembolization, radiofrequency&#xD;
             ablation, percutaneous ethanol injection, or cryoablation) must have been completed ≥&#xD;
             4 weeks before first dose of study medication. Note: patients who received sole&#xD;
             intrahepatic intra-arterial chemotherapy, without lipiodol or embolizing agents are&#xD;
             not eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Performance Status (ECOG PS) of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least one uni-dimensional measurable lesion by computed tomography (CT) scan or&#xD;
             magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) according to RECIST (RECIST version 1.1) and no older&#xD;
             than 28 days before start of the study treatment. Tumor lesions situated in a&#xD;
             previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to other loco-regional therapy,&#xD;
             may be considered measurable if there has been demonstrated progression in the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow and organ function as assessed by the laboratory tests performed&#xD;
             within 7 days before of treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For patients recruited in the expansion cohort only, provision of archival (block) or&#xD;
             fresh tumor tissue samples at baseline is mandatory. If archival tumor tissue is not&#xD;
             available, patients should be willing to undergo a biopsy for provision of fresh tumor&#xD;
             samples&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior systemic therapy for HCC; prior exposure to regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous treatment with a programmed death 1 (PD1), programmed death-ligand (PD-L1),&#xD;
             or cytotoxicT-lymphocyte-associated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitors, or any form of&#xD;
             immunotherapy for HCC.&#xD;
&#xD;

             (seasonal flu vaccines that do not contain a live virus are permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease (active defined as having autoimmune disease related&#xD;
             symptoms and detectable autoantibodies) that has required systemic treatment in the&#xD;
             past 2 years (i.e., with use of diseasemodifying agents, corticosteroids, or&#xD;
             immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or&#xD;
             physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency,&#xD;
             etc.) is not considered a form of systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving chronic systemic steroid therapy&#xD;
             (in dosing exceeding 10 mg daily of prednisone equivalent) or any other form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drugs. The&#xD;
             use of physiologic doses of corticosteroids may be approved after consultation with&#xD;
             the Sponsor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dual active HBV infection (HBsAg (+) and /or detectable HBV DNA) and HCV infection&#xD;
             (anti-HCV Ab(+) and detectable HCV RNA) at study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pleural effusion or ascites that causes respiratory compromise (≥ CTCAE Grade 2&#xD;
             dyspnea).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known history of metastatic brain or meningeal tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant acute gastrointestinal disorders with diarrhea as a major symptom e.g.,&#xD;
