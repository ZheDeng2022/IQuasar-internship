  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to measure pulmonary function in term and preterm&#xD;
      infants with and without pulmonary disease including respiratory distress syndrome,&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia, transient tachypnea of the newborn, meconium aspiration syndrome,&#xD;
      and response to treatments given to newborn infants with lung diseases using a non-invasive&#xD;
      airway oscillometry system.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      TremoFlo™ N-100 (For Investigational Use Only) Airwave Oscillometry System™ (THORASYS&#xD;
      Thoracic Medical Systems Inc. Montreal, Quebec, Canada) is a technology for measuring lung&#xD;
      mechanics without patient effort. Pulmonary function testing using flow-volume and lung&#xD;
      volumes is one of the most widely used tests to objectively measure lung function in adults.&#xD;
      Such measurements are dependent on effort and coordination by the patient which is not&#xD;
      possible for newborn infants. The minimum age for spirometry is typically 6 years to master&#xD;
      the technique. Therefore, newborn infants usually require forced exhalation, flow&#xD;
      interruption, and often sedation/anesthesia in order to obtain accurate pulmonary function&#xD;
      measurements. Infant pulmonary function testing can be time-consuming and expensive to&#xD;
      perform in newborn infants. This has limited the utilization of this potentially informative&#xD;
      method of studying lung function. Measurements of lung function will be particularly&#xD;
      informative during transition from having lungs filled with fluid during intra-uterine life&#xD;
      to having lungs filled with air in extra-uterine life in preterm and term babies without lung&#xD;
      disease, as well as in newborn infants with lung diseases including respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, transient tachypnea of the newborn, meconium aspiration&#xD;
      syndrome, and after the effects of treatments given to newborn infants with lung diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TremoFlo device uses the forced oscillation technique during spontaneous infant breathing&#xD;
      and notably does not require any sedation to perform. The forced oscillation technique&#xD;
      measures lung function by superimposing a gentle multi-frequency airwave onto the infant's&#xD;
      respiratory airflow while the infant breathes spontaneously. Only a short period of breathing&#xD;
      is required to obtain a reliable measurement of airway resistance and reactance. Oscillometry&#xD;
      has been successfully utilized to quantify lung function in asthmatic children and adults&#xD;
      with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, but never previously in infants. This proposal&#xD;
      brings this non-invasive technique of measuring lung function to the neonatal population to&#xD;
      identify changes in respiratory mechanics between term and pre-term gestations and quantify&#xD;
      fluctuations in infant lung function in response to disease progression and therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention. The ease of oscillometry that only requires tidal breathing eliminates the need&#xD;
      for patient cooperation and maneuvers that previously excluded lung function testing in the&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care unit. This proposal will evaluate the feasibility and clinical value&#xD;
      of oscillometry in newborns, both to detect changes in premature compared to full-term&#xD;
      gestations as well as disease cohorts by introducing functional measures of lung function to&#xD;
      bedside care.&#xD;
