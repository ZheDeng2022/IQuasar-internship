  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the United States, thiotepa has been utilized in reduced intensity conditioning regimens&#xD;
      for alternative donor courses (double umbilical cord blood transplant (dUCBT) and&#xD;
      haplo-identical transplants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that thiotepa at a dose of 10mg/kg, in combination with melphalan&#xD;
      (100mg/m2) and fludarabine (160mg/m2) as a reduced intensity conditioning regimen for&#xD;
      alternative donor transplant is safe and effective in patients with hematologic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that this regimen has been investigated extensively, and the current study proposes to&#xD;
      confirm those previous observations with a small modification (melphalan dose reduction due&#xD;
      to previous mucositis rates with higher doses), this will be a phase II study designed to&#xD;
      measure disease-free-survival.&#xD;

      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the effectiveness of Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Melphalan in alternative donor&#xD;
      transplants as measured by leukemia free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the 1- year OS, Relapse, TRM, aGVHD and cGVHD rates and the rates of neutrophil and&#xD;
      platelet engraftment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is a Phase II study of Thiotepa, Fludarabine, and Melphalan in alternative&#xD;
      donor transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be assessed for safety and tolerability (including adverse events, serious&#xD;
      adverse events, and clinical/laboratory assessments) using a continuous monitoring approach.&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for up to 1 year or until progression of disease, relapse, or&#xD;
      death.&#xD;
