  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to demonstrate reversal of the anticoagulant effect of dabigatran in&#xD;
      patients treated with dabigatran etexilate who have uncontrolled or life-threatening bleeding&#xD;
      requiring urgent intervention, and in patients treated with dabigatran etexilate who require&#xD;
      emergency surgery or other invasive procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess the reduction or cessation of bleeding, evaluate the&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, safety and the pharmacokinetics of dabigatran in the presence of&#xD;
      idarucizumab.&#xD;

    <description>Maximum reversal of anticoagulant effect of dabigatran based on central laboratory determination of ecarin clotting time is reported.&#xD;
The maximum reversal of anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is defined for patients with at least one post-dose coagulation test results and pre-dose result higher than 100% Upper limit of normal (ULN). Maximum reversal is calculated as 100% x (pre-dose value - post-dose value)/(pre-dose value - 100% ULN). If the calculated reversal is &gt; 100, it was set to 100. 100% ULN is 41.26 seconds.</description>

      <recruitment_details>This study was to demonstrate the reversal of the anticoagulant effects of dabigatran by intravenous administration of idarucizumab in patients treated with dabigatran etexilate who had uncontrolled bleeding or required emergency surgery or procedures over treatment period of 1 day following by 30 days follow-up.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>All subjects were screened for eligibility prior to participation in the trial. Subjects attended a specialist site which ensured that they (the subjects) strictly met all inclusion and none of the exclusion criteria.&#xD;

        <description>Maximum reversal of anticoagulant effect of dabigatran based on central laboratory determination of ecarin clotting time is reported.&#xD;
The maximum reversal of anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is defined for patients with at least one post-dose coagulation test results and pre-dose result higher than 100% Upper limit of normal (ULN). Maximum reversal is calculated as 100% x (pre-dose value - post-dose value)/(pre-dose value - 100% ULN). If the calculated reversal is &gt; 100, it was set to 100. 100% ULN is 41.26 seconds.</description>

        <description>Maximum reversal of anticoagulation as measured by activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) is reported.&#xD;
The reversal of anticoagulant effect of dabigatran is defined for patients with at least one post-dose coagulation test results and pre-dose result higher than 100% Upper limit of normal (ULN). Maximum reversal is calculated as 100% x (pre-dose value - post-dose value)/(pre-dose value - 100% ULN). If the calculated reversal is &gt; 100, it was set to 100. 100% ULN is 39.80 seconds.</description>
