  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Radiation therapy remains the principal treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The&#xD;
      most frequently occurred radiation-related side effect is probably the radiation-induced oral&#xD;
      mucositis, which affects up to 100% of NPC patients receiving radiation therapy, especially&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy. Significant weight loss caused by Oral mucositis will keep&#xD;
      patients in worse nutrition status and then to decline immune function, hematopoietic&#xD;
      function and repair function, which will influence the patient's quality of life, reduce the&#xD;
      tolerance of treatment, and affect treatment effect. At present, the guidelines at home and&#xD;
      abroad more and more emphasize that early nutrition treatment and intervention before&#xD;
      systemic malnutrition, also suggest nutrition treatment and intervention at the same time of&#xD;
      anti-tumor treatment. First choice of nutritional intervention is oral nutrition supplement.&#xD;
      Nutren® Optimum has a higher protein ratio and 50% of the protein sources were lactalbumin&#xD;
      and 50% casein. Lactalbumin is a high-quality protein, with the highest nutritional value&#xD;
      among a variety of proteins. A cup of 210ml's Nutren® Optimum contains 5g lactalbumin.&#xD;
      Nutren® Optimum also contains dietary fiber, vitamin E, monounsaturated fat, L-carnitine, 30&#xD;
      kinds of vitamins and minerals and other nutrients, which can provide a comprehensive and&#xD;
      balanced nutrition. This single center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial&#xD;
      selects Nutren® Optimum as oral nutritional support for interventional group while routine&#xD;
      diet guidance for control group, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early and&#xD;
      whole course nutritional support by Nutren® Optimum during intensity modulated radiation&#xD;
      therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma which can improve patients' nutritional state and&#xD;
      quality of life, reduce side effects and improve the tolerability and effectiveness of&#xD;
      antitumor treatment.&#xD;

      Radiation therapy remains the principal treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). The&#xD;
      most frequently occurred radiation-related side effect is probably the radiation-induced oral&#xD;
      mucositis, which affects up to 100% of NPC patients receiving radiation therapy, especially&#xD;
      combined with chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral mucositis is just the most common cause of significant weight loss for patients with&#xD;
      nasopharyngeal carcinoma during treatment. Patients with oral mucositis will have restriction&#xD;
      of normal food, and alternative to semi liquid or liquid diet, resulting in inadequate&#xD;
      nutritional intake, malnutrition, weight loss. Furthermore, worse nutrition status will&#xD;
      decline immune function, hematopoietic function and repair function, which will influence the&#xD;
      patient's quality of life, reduce the tolerance of treatment, and affect treatment effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present, the guidelines at home and abroad more and more emphasize that early nutrition&#xD;
      treatment and intervention before systemic malnutrition, also suggest nutrition treatment and&#xD;
      intervention at the same time of anti-tumor treatment. Therefore, the timing of nutritional&#xD;
      intervention changes from ineffective antitumor therapy as a palliative treatment to the&#xD;
      early start of antitumor therapy. For nasopharyngeal carcinoma, early and whole course&#xD;
      nutritional intervention can prevent and treat malnutrition or cachexia; improve the&#xD;
      treatment tolerance and compliance; control or improve certain adverse reactions of&#xD;
      radiotherapy; improve the quality of life; and then improve the function and curative effect.&#xD;
      First choice of nutritional intervention is oral nutrition supplement. For patients without&#xD;
      gastrointestinal dysfunction, parenteral nutrition is not necessary, even harmful, increasing&#xD;
      the risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutren® Optimum has a higher protein ratio (P:F:C = 17:35:48), and 50% of the protein sources&#xD;
      were lactalbumin and 50% casein. Lactalbumin is a high-quality protein, which dissolved and&#xD;
      dispersed in the whey protein. Lactalbumin is easy digestion and absorption, with high&#xD;
      bioavailability, and net protein utilization rate (NPU) is higher than that of casein and soy&#xD;
      protein. Lactalbumin is rich in branched chain amino acids, which can be used as energy&#xD;
      material for energy. Lactalbumin has a sulfur-containing amino acid, which can maintain the&#xD;
      level of GSH and be in the role of antioxidation; containing glutamine, which contributes to&#xD;
      muscle glycogen update and improves immune function. In addition, lactalbumin can also&#xD;
      significantly reduce neutrophil apoptosis, enhance neutrophil migration and phagocytosis, and&#xD;
      enhance the immune function. Therefore, lactalbumin has the highest nutritional value among a&#xD;
      variety of proteins, known as protein king. A cup of 210ml's Nutren® Optimum contains 5g&#xD;
      lactalbumin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutren® Optimum contains dietary fiber, which produces short chain fatty acids to promote the&#xD;
      proliferation of intestinal probiotics, and play anti-inflammatory, pro-apoptotic, anti-tumor&#xD;
      effect, and maintain intestinal health. At the same time, vitamin E is specially added in&#xD;
      Nutren® Optimum to protect T lymphocytes, protect red blood cells, anti-oxidation, inhibit&#xD;
      platelet aggregation, enhance immunity, and so on. In addition, 64% fat sources of Nutren®&#xD;
      Optimum are monounsaturated fat, which conducive to the metabolism of glucose and lipid.&#xD;
      Especially added L-carnitine can promote fat oxidation by using better fat for energy,&#xD;
      without reducing water and muscle. Nutren® Optimum provides 30 kinds of vitamins and minerals&#xD;
      and other nutrients, and can provide a comprehensive and balanced nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single center, open-label, randomized controlled clinical trial selects Nutren® Optimum&#xD;
      as oral nutritional support for interventional group while routine diet guidance for control&#xD;
      group, aiming to evaluate the efficacy and safety of early and whole course nutritional&#xD;
      support by Nutren® Optimum during intensity modulated radiation therapy for nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      carcinoma, which can improve patients' nutritional state and quality of life, reduce side&#xD;
      effects and improve the tolerability and effectiveness of antitumor treatment.&#xD;
