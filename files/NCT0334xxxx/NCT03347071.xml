    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate effects of a 7-week undergraduate course,&#xD;
      incorporating Eat Breathe Thrive program curriculum, offered to female student-athletes in&#xD;
      order to increase positive body image, emotional regulation, interoceptive awareness,&#xD;
      self-care skills, and intuitive eating. The undergraduate course is structured around the Eat&#xD;
      Breathe Thrive program curriculum, which aims to: a) teach somatic practices that increase&#xD;
      interoceptive awareness, b) provide healthy tools for emotional regulation, c) allow for the&#xD;
      creation of community-based networks of support, and (d) foster a sense of meaning and&#xD;
      purpose through service activities. In a non-randomized controlled trial, the investigators&#xD;
      plan to examine whether this preventative undergraduate course is found effective in a female&#xD;
      student-athlete population in preventing and decreasing eating disorder risk. The&#xD;
      investigators also plan to examine whether the program is found effective in increasing&#xD;
      protective factors, such as self-care behaviors, interoceptive awareness, intuitive eating,&#xD;
      and emotional regulation skills.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To the investigators' knowledge, there are no studies that incorporate yoga into eating&#xD;
      disorder prevention intervention in a student-athlete population, indicating a gap in&#xD;
      literature that the proposed study aims to address. In this study, a 7-week undergraduate&#xD;
      course offered to female student-athletes, which incorporates Eat Breathe Thrive program&#xD;
      curriculum, will be examined to evaluate preventative effects. The Eat Breathe Thrive program&#xD;
      was selected by the course instructors to provide female student-athletes with mental health&#xD;
      support, utilizing an interactive multisession format with a positive psychology orientation.&#xD;
      Eat Breathe Thrive's curriculum focuses on the reduction of eating disorder risk by lesson&#xD;
      plans centered around positive engagement with others and developing a strong relationship&#xD;
      with self. This framework is based on the idea that individuals are able to sustain proper&#xD;
      health, relationships, and overall well-being using the positive embodiment tools and&#xD;
      psychoeducational information learned. The study aims to contribute to the eating disorder&#xD;
      literature targeting female student-athletes by examining the effects of a prevention program&#xD;
      delivered as part of an undergraduate course.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevention course participants will show a decrease in disordered eating behaviors when&#xD;
           compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevention course participants will show an increase in self-care behaviors compared to&#xD;
           controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevention course participants will show an increase in interoceptive awareness,&#xD;
           intuitive eating, and emotional regulation when compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevention course participants will show a decrease in difficulties with emotional&#xD;
           regulation and an increase in tolerance to distress when compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prevention course participants will show better maintenance of wellbeing as well as&#xD;
           better maintenance in decreased symptomatology as compared to compared to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will employ self-report surveys to examine the preventative effects of&#xD;
      participation in a 7-week course utilizing a longitudinal non-randomized control design with&#xD;
      Division I female student-athletes in western New York. Participants will be current female&#xD;
      student-athletes recruited within the university's athletic department. Experimental group&#xD;
      participants will be recruited from their enrollment in the prevention course offered that&#xD;
      incorporates the Eat Breathe Thrive curriculum. Since the prevention course has a capacity of&#xD;
      30 students per semester, data will be collected for four 7-week semesters to account for&#xD;
      total sample size. The study will be recruiting from a total of 120 female student-athletes&#xD;
      in the experimental group. Female student-athletes not enrolled in the prevention course will&#xD;
      be recruited for control. Each semester, course enrollment numbers will be matched by&#xD;
      recruiting research participants from the rest of the female student-athlete population at&#xD;
      the university (those who are not enrolled in the course). Female student-athletes in the&#xD;
      experimental and control groups will complete all study measures at the same time points&#xD;
      throughout the study. This study is based on the need to provide female student-athletes with&#xD;
      greater access to effective tools and strategies that support their well-being as well as to&#xD;
      protect this high-risk population against the development of an eating disorder.&#xD;
