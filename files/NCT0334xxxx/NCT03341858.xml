      STRONG Kids 2: A Cells to Society Approach to Nutrition&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview Using a cells-to-society approach to nutrition, this transdisciplinary project will&#xD;
      provide unique insights into how individual biology interacts with the family environment to&#xD;
      promote healthy eating habits in young children. It is one of the first studies to take a&#xD;
      longitudinal look at the habits, including milk and dairy consumption, from birth. STRONG&#xD;
      Kids 2 is built upon previous research from STRONG Kids 1 with preschool-aged children,&#xD;
      documenting the relationship among genetic, child, and family factors in predicting BMI and&#xD;
      dietary habits. The study sample includes 450 infants and their families located in small&#xD;
      urban communities in central Illinois. Biological samples and height and weight measurements&#xD;
      from infants and toddlers are collected at 6 weeks, 3, 12, 18, 24, and 36 months, 4 and 5&#xD;
      years. Mothers are surveyed about weaning, dietary habits, household routines, children's&#xD;
      emotions, feeding styles, and milk and dairy consumption. Additional measures such as&#xD;
      maternal height and weight are also being collected.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Despite increased public awareness, there has been little progress over the past 2 decades in&#xD;
      stemming the tide of childhood obesity in the U.S. Recent projections indicate that by 2030,&#xD;
      at least 42% of American adults will be obese and 11% will be categorized as severely&#xD;
      obese.Unfortunately, high rates of obesity begin in early childhood. According to the most&#xD;
      recent estimates of obesity prevalence in U.S. children, 26.7% of 2-5 year-olds were&#xD;
      overweight (&gt;85th BMI percentile) and 12.1% were considered obese (&gt;95th BMI percentile).&#xD;
      Epidemiological data show that overweight and obesity during early childhood tracks into&#xD;
      later childhood, adolescence, and adulthood.The persistence of unhealthy weight from early&#xD;
      childhood into later years is multi factorial involving biological and behavioral facets,&#xD;
      which may explain, in part, the relatively poor success of weight loss programs for children&#xD;
      and adolescents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Synergistic Theory and Research on Obesity and Nutrition Group (STRONG) Kids Program&#xD;
      (SKP) at the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign is a well-established interdisciplinary&#xD;
      research and education program aimed at identifying the multiple factors that contribute to&#xD;
      unhealthy weight gain in preschool age (2-5 year-old) children. The team incorporates a&#xD;
      &quot;cells-to-society&quot; approach, recognizing that biological and socio-environmental factors&#xD;
      interact to affect eating and physical activity behaviors. The purpose of this project is to&#xD;
      expand the STRONG Kids Program and launch a birth cohort study to examine the impact of food,&#xD;
      milk,and dairy product consumption on weight trajectory from birth to five years of age. Due&#xD;
      to the multidisciplinary expertise of our research team we will also examine the&#xD;
      contributions of biological and environmental factors to the development of dietary habits,&#xD;
      diet quality and the child's growth trajectory. The research team capitalize on emerging&#xD;
      scientific findings that demonstrate that variability in individual biology(genetics), child&#xD;
      self-regulation (e.g., inhibitory control), and family household characteristics (e.g.,&#xD;
      routines) make significant contributions to the development of satiety and food preferences&#xD;
      during early childhood. This innovative longitudinal study will be the first of its kind to&#xD;
      evaluate the composition of the gut microbiota over time and its potential impact on the&#xD;
      self-regulatory personality characteristics in young children known to affect food&#xD;
      preferences. Further, the research team will use well-established protocols to assess&#xD;
      maternal and household characteristics known to promote healthy eating patterns to determine&#xD;
      the intersection of child biological functioning and the introduction of solid foods,&#xD;
      including milk and dairy foods, during the weaning period and their effects on weight&#xD;
      trajectory up to three years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The STRONG Kids Program 2 (SKP2), will recruit a cohort sample of 400 infants and their&#xD;
      families into a comprehensive five-year longitudinal study that will be unique by its&#xD;
      theory-driven integration of genetics, nutrition, child development and family science. This&#xD;
      comprehensive approach will allow for a greater understanding of how dietary habits are&#xD;
      established during the first five years of life and contribute to healthy weight. The team&#xD;
      will collect biological samples (saliva and stool specimens) and height,weight from infants&#xD;
      and toddlers at 1 and 6 weeks and 3 months, after the introduction of solid foods, 12, 18,&#xD;
      24, 36 months, 4 and 5 years postpartum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concordantly we will survey mothers about weaning, dietary habits, household routines, child&#xD;
      self-regulation, feeding practices and styles, and maternal height and weight. This&#xD;
      comprehensive approach is based on our first phase of STRONG Kids research (SKP1) with&#xD;
      preschool age children, which has documented the relationship among child and family factors&#xD;
      in predicting BMI and dietary habits.To date, there is scant evidence-based information on&#xD;
      how parents make decisions to introduce new foods during the weaning period and the effects&#xD;
      of different food types on child weight from birth to the early years. Specifically, there is&#xD;
      a glaring absence of scientific information on the contribution that individual biology plays&#xD;
      in positively interacting with milk and cultured dairy products(e.g, cheese, yogurt) as&#xD;
      initial foods introduced during the weaning period and their contribution to sustaining&#xD;
      healthy weight during the preschool years. This is likely to be a complex interaction among&#xD;
      the child's biological make-up, temperament and response to satiety, the parent's feeding&#xD;
      practices and styles, availability of food resources, and the feeding policies in place once&#xD;
      the child is enrolled in child care. The STRONG Kids team has the expertise to address these&#xD;
      multiple influences and can provide a fresh comprehensive approach to the study of food&#xD;
      consumption and weight gain during the early years.&#xD;

      Biological and genetic sampling: Stool samples from infant and A stool sample from the mother&#xD;
      will also be provided at the 6week home visit. A saliva sample will be collected at the 6&#xD;
      week home visit from both the mother and infant. A trained researcher will swab each&#xD;
      participant's mouth and collect a small sample using a non-invasive technique.In order to&#xD;
      more accurately assess the dietary intake of breast-fed and formula-fed infants we will be&#xD;
      requesting a sample of the mother's breastmilk or the formula that she is feeding her infant&#xD;
      at 6 weeks of age. The concentrations of nutrient and bioactive components in the breastmilk&#xD;
      or formula will be analyzed. BREASTMILK SAMPLE: Breastfeeding mothers will be asked to&#xD;
      provide a breast milk sample representative of the milk provided inthe 24 hours prior to the&#xD;
      fecal sample collection at 6 weeks postpartum.&#xD;
