  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase I trial using EGFR Bi-armed Activated T-cells (BATs) in combination with&#xD;
      standard of care temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation (RT) in patients with glioblastoma (GBM).&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine a safe dose of EGFR BATs when given with standard of&#xD;
      care therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In addition to finding the safe dose of EGFR BATs, immune evaluations will be performed as&#xD;
      delineated in the schedule of events to measure immune responses during all stages of&#xD;
      treatment for GBM.&#xD;

             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator.&#xD;
