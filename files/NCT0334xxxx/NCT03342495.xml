  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The Transition Navigator Trial (TNT) is a pragmatic randomized controlled trial evaluating&#xD;
      the effectiveness of usual care plus a patient navigator service versus usual care plus&#xD;
      newsletters and other educational materials, to improve transition outcomes among adolescents&#xD;
      aged 16-21 who have chronic health conditions requiring transfer to adult specialty care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will provide urgently needed data to guide health care providers and policy makers&#xD;
      regarding the provision of coordinated transition care. These results have the potential to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Change care delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Improve health outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improve the experiences of young adult transition to adult care&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transition is the purposeful, planned movement of adolescent and young adults with chronic&#xD;
      health conditions from child-centered to adult-oriented health systems. Transition includes,&#xD;
      but is not limited to transfer to adult care. Transfer of care, which occurs during a&#xD;
      vulnerable developmental period around age 18 introduces gaps in continuity of care that can&#xD;
      lead to detrimental health outcomes in young adults. Therefore, provision of coordinated and&#xD;
      developmentally appropriate care during the transition period is necessary to maintain health&#xD;
      and to sustain investments made in pediatric health care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical practice guidelines for transition to adult care recommend the use of patient&#xD;
      navigators to coordinate the entry of patients into a complex and unfamiliar adult health&#xD;
      care system. Patient navigators provide individualized supports to facilitate medical&#xD;
      follow-up and adherence. A limited number of studies have shown that access to a patient&#xD;
      navigator during transition decreases drop-out from medical care and disease specific adverse&#xD;
      events. No study to date has evaluated the benefits of a patient navigator to improve patient&#xD;
      and or health system outcomes, when implemented across multiple chronic disease settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to evaluate the impact of a patient navigator intervention compared to treatment as&#xD;
           usual for 16 to 21 year olds living with chronic health conditions who are transferring&#xD;
           to adult care with respect to healthcare utilization and patient reported outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to obtain perceptions of stakeholders regarding the role of patient navigators in&#xD;
           reducing barriers to adult-oriented ambulatory care&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to determine the net health care cost impact attributable to the navigator intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      A qualitative study sampling participants randomized into the intervention arm at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the trial will also be undertaken to understand the patient experience.&#xD;
