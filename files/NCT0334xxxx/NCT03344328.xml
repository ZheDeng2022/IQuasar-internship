    <textblock>
      Cancer-induced peripheral neuropathies (CIPN) remain a real problem in oncology (Balayssac et&#xD;
      al., 2011). These CIPN are induced by certain classes of anticancer drugs such as taxanes&#xD;
      (paclitaxel and docetaxel), platinum salts (cisplatin and oxaliplatin), alkaloids of&#xD;
      Madagascar periwinkle (vincristine), bortezomib, thalidomide and eribulin (Balayssac et al.,&#xD;
      2011; Vahdat et al., 2013). These CIPN essentially translate into sensory disorders such as&#xD;
      paresthesia, dysesthetics or numbness. More rarely, these CIPN may be associated with motor&#xD;
      or vegetative disorders (Balayssac et al., 2011). According to the recent meta-analysis by&#xD;
      Hershman et al., no treatment can be proposed as a &quot;gold standard&quot; for preventing or treating&#xD;
      CIPN (Hershman et al., 2014). As a result, oncologists reduce or stop doses of neurotoxic&#xD;
      anticancer drugs because patients with CIPN have a marked deterioration in quality of life&#xD;
      and co-morbidities such as anxiety, depression and sleep disorders (Hong et al., 2014; Mols&#xD;
      et al., 2014). Therefore, understanding the pathophysiology of CIPN is essential to propose&#xD;
      new therapeutic strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among neurotoxic anticancer drugs, bortezomib remains relatively little studied in terms of&#xD;
      pathophysiology compared to platinum salts or taxanes, while the neurotoxicity of bortezomib&#xD;
      remains a limiting factor in treatment. Since 2012, the FDA and EMA have validated the&#xD;
      administration of bortezomib subcutaneously instead of intravenously in order to limit the&#xD;
      neurotoxicity of bortezomib (Minarik et al., 2015). Indeed, a large study (N=222) reported&#xD;
      that subcutaneous administration of bortezomib allowed the same therapeutic efficacy to be&#xD;
      maintained while improving the safety profile and in particular limiting peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathies (CIPN all grades: 38% vs. 53%, p=0.044, grade&gt; 2: 24% vs. 41%, p=0.012 and&#xD;
      grade&gt; 3: 6% vs. 16%, p=0.026) However, a recent retrospective study (N=446) reports that the&#xD;
      prevalence of bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathies after subcutaneous administration&#xD;
      remains relatively high: all grade: 41%, grade&gt; 2: 18%, grade&gt; 3: 4%, and above all that this&#xD;
      prevalence is not different between subcutaneous and intravenous routes (Minarik et al.,&#xD;
      2015).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Only 2 studies evaluated quantitatively and qualitatively the sensitivity disorders in&#xD;
      patients with bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy by intravenous (Boyette-Davis et al.,&#xD;
      2011; Cata et al., 2007). In these 2 studies, the patients presented a distribution of the&#xD;
      sensitive disorders characteristic of the so-called stocking-glove distribution of the CIPN&#xD;
      affecting the distal extremities of the limbs. A quantification of the sensory thresholds&#xD;
      (QST) was carried out and revealed a number of sensitive anomalies. Neuropathic patients&#xD;
      suffer from deficits in tactile sensitivity and disorders of thermal sensitivity. In Cata et&#xD;
      al. study, patients showed hypersensitivity to painful cold (CIPN patients vs. healthy&#xD;
      controls: 10.4±2°C vs. 3±1°C, p&lt;0.05), hot perception deficit (CIPN patients vs. healthy&#xD;
      controls: 40.2±1.4°C vs. 37±0.74°C, p&lt;0.05) and a painful hot sensitivity deficit. However,&#xD;
      the cold sensory disorders would be more inconstant, because in neuropathic patients&#xD;
      suffering from bortezomib-induced peripheral neuropathy, another study by the same team found&#xD;
      only warm tactile and thermal sensory anomalies, but did not reveal a cold perception anomaly&#xD;
      (Boyette-Davis et al., 2011). Finally, a few rare cases of bortezomib-induced hearing&#xD;
      impairment have been described in the literature (Chim and Wong, 2008; Engelhardt et al.,&#xD;
      2005). This ototoxicity is thought to be linked to an alteration in the functioning of&#xD;
      peroxisomes (Lee et al., 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      No studies have actually evaluated the long-term prevalence of bortezomib-induced neuropathy.&#xD;
      The only studies with long-term follow-up have carried out a cumulative assessment over 22&#xD;
      months (Pantani et al., 2014), 32 months (Dimopoulos et al., 2013) and 60 months (Wang et&#xD;
      al., 2016) of the therapeutic response and adverse reactions induced by bortezomib. No&#xD;
      studies dedicated to neurological adverse events have been conducted in the long term. Thus,&#xD;
      the prevalence, duration, intensity and reversibility of bortezomib-induced neuropathy are&#xD;
      poorly known in the long term (more than 5 years). On the other hand, a measurement tool such&#xD;
      as the QLQ-CIPN20 questionnaire (EORTC) evaluating the intensity of sensory, motor and&#xD;
      vegetative disorders associated with CIPN, a questionnaire presented as the most specific&#xD;
      tool in the evaluation of CIPN (Lavoie Smith et al., 2013; Postma et al., 2005), has never&#xD;
      been tested in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study project aims to provide precise knowledge on the prevalence, intensity and&#xD;
      consequences of bortezomib-induced neuropathy in the short (2016-2014) and medium (2014-2012)&#xD;
      term after subcutaneous injection and in the long term (2012-2008) after intravenous&#xD;
      injection, knowing that at the Clermont-Ferrand University Hospital, the route of&#xD;
      administration of bortezomib was intravenous. Retreat to at least 9 years of age could&#xD;
      provide information on the kinetics of onset and disappearance of neuropathy after&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatments (data unknown in the literature to date). Finally, these data&#xD;
      acquired in a French context relating to bortezomib-induced neuropathy may be used in future&#xD;
      studies evaluating new intervention strategies to prevent and/or treat bortezomib-induced&#xD;
      neuropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will combine retrospective treatment data from the CHIMIO®&#xD;
      chemotherapy prescribing software with data obtained from patients by answering&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be identified from the CHIMIO® chemotherapy prescription software database. The&#xD;
      algorithm (computer query) will identify all patients who received bortezomib-based&#xD;
      chemotherapy for the multiple myeloma indication between 2008 and 2016. All the&#xD;
      questionnaires used are validated in the scientific literature.&#xD;
