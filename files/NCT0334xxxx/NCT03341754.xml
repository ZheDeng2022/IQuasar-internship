      study will include 2 vaccine groups and an infectivity control (IC) group consisting of&#xD;

      This is a study designed to assess the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and protective&#xD;
      efficacy of 2 heterologous prime-boost vaccine regimens in healthy, malaria na誰ve adults. The&#xD;
      study will include 2 vaccine groups and an infectivity control (IC) group consisting of&#xD;
      non-immunized subjects. Subjects to be immunized will be randomly assigned to one of two&#xD;
      vaccine groups. Approximately 4 weeks after administration of the boosting immunization the&#xD;
      vaccinated groups and the IC group will participate in CHMI wherein subjects will be exposed&#xD;
      to the bites of 5 Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes carrying infectious Pf sporozoites within a&#xD;
      controlled clinical environment. Protection will be determined by the examination of thick&#xD;
      blood smears through 28 days post-CHMI and by retrospective PCR analysis for the presence of&#xD;
      blood stage parasites. All groups will be enrolled and evaluated in one cohort. Due to a&#xD;
      limit in the number of subjects who can undergo malaria challenge at the facility in one day,&#xD;
      CHMI will be conducted over two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 (2-antigen): 3 doses at 4 week intervals (Week 0, 4, and 8) of DNA prime with D-C +&#xD;
      D-A at 2 mg total (1 mg per construct) per dose as two 1 mL IM injections of the blended&#xD;
      D-CA, one in each arm, via Biojector 2000 needle-free injection device or an equivalent&#xD;
      disposable syringe needle-free injection device. This will be followed after 16 weeks (Week&#xD;
      24) by 1 dose of ChAd63-C + ChAd63-A boost, at a total dose of 1 x 1011 virus particles (vp)&#xD;
      (5 x 1010 vp/construct) as a single IM injection of 0.65mL, using a needle and syringe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 (3-antigen): 3 doses at 4 week intervals (Week 0, 4, and 8) of DNA prime with D-C +&#xD;
      D-A + D-T at 3 mg total (1 mg per construct) per dose as two 1 mL intramuscular (IM)&#xD;
      injections of the blended D-CAT, one in each arm, via Biojector 2000 needle-free injection&#xD;
      device or an equivalent disposable syringe needle-freeinjection device. This will be followed&#xD;
      after 16 weeks (Week 24) by 1 dose of ChAd63-C + ChAd63-A + ChAd63-T boost, at a total dose&#xD;
      of 1.5 x 1011 vp (5 x 1010 vp/construct) as a single IM injection of 1.0mL, using a needle&#xD;
      and syringe.&#xD;
