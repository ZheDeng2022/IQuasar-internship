    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effect of standard heart failure therapy plus oral solution&#xD;
      with protein succinylate iron compared to placebo on the primary end point of 6 minute walk&#xD;
      distance at 24th week in patients with chronic ejection fraction reduction heart failure and&#xD;
      iron deficiency.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This clinical trial was designed as a multicenter, prospective, randomized, double-blind&#xD;
      controlled study. Patients were randomly divided into one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group: standard treatment + placebo（1 bottle orally, twice daily, take orally before&#xD;
      meals, duration of treatment 16-24 weeks）.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test group: standard treatment + Iron protein succinylate oral solution (1 bottle orally,&#xD;
      twice daily, take orally before meals, duration of treatment 16-24 weeks）.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is according to the change of 6 Minute walk distance from the&#xD;
      baseline at 24 weeks, it is estimated the mean difference between two groups is 20 meter,&#xD;
      standard deviation 80 meter, statistical power 80%, type I error 0.05, follow up loss&#xD;
      15%，estimated total sample size 600.&#xD;
