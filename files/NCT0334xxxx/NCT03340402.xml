      This research study is studying an intervention as a possible treatment for Triple Negative&#xD;
      Breast Cancer.&#xD;

      This research study is a Pilot Study, which means this is the first time investigators are&#xD;
      examining this study intervention in participants with triple negative breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved proton radiation for your&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that proton radiation administered in higher doses over a shorter&#xD;
      time period may help stop cancer from growing while protecting the normal tissue cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are researching how well proton radiation works in&#xD;
      treating this type of breast cancer. Proton radiation is currently used in other types of&#xD;
      breast cancer and the investigators believe that the higher doses of proton radiation&#xD;
      administered over a shorter time period may lead to maximum efficacy in treating this type of&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;

    <description>Accelerated partial breast irradiation using proton beam scanning will consist of;&#xD;
5 daily treatments using custom prone patient immobilization, contrast-enhanced CT planning, and daily image guidance&#xD;
Radiation therapy may be delivered with photons if proton treatments cannot be delivered&#xD;
Dose will be prescribed such that the gross tumor (GTV) receives the prescription dose per institutional policy and standard of care&#xD;
Daily target localization will also be confirmed using AlignRTTM</description>
