      Objective: The primary objective of this trial is to investigate whether prednisolone&#xD;
      improves symptom severity as compared to placebo when given in addition to antipsychotic&#xD;
      medication to patients with early-stage psychotic disorder. Secondary objectives include&#xD;
      improvement of cognitive functioning and positive, negative and general psychopathological&#xD;
      symptoms as well as general functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Randomized placebo-controlled double-blind trial. Study population: 90 men and&#xD;
      women, with an age of 18 years and older, diagnosed with schizophrenia spectrum disorder. The&#xD;
      time interval between the onset of psychosis and study entry should not exceed five years and&#xD;
      CRP level should be at least 3.9 mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Patients will be randomized 1:1 to either prednisolone or placebo daily for a&#xD;
      period of 6 weeks. Identical tablets will be administered. Prednisolone will be initiated at&#xD;
      40 mg for three days, after which it will be phased out within 6 weeks after start, following&#xD;
      current treatment guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Primary outcome is change in symptom severity, expressed as&#xD;
      a change in total score on the Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) from baseline to&#xD;
      end of the 6-week treatment. Secondary outcomes are a 6-month follow-up assessment of PANSS,&#xD;
      cognitive functioning (measured through a repeatable neurocognitive battery, change in GAF&#xD;
      scores and the measurement of various immunological biomarkers. In post-hoc analyses,&#xD;
      attempts will be made to identify baseline blood markers with predictive properties regarding&#xD;
      improvement in the anti-inflammatory drug treatment arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits for consumers and care givers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A decrease in symptom severity is expected, as low grade brain inflammation may be associated&#xD;
      with psychotic symptoms. The results may give raise to a new line of scientific research as&#xD;
      well as treatment options for a disabling disorder.&#xD;
