      The purpose of this study is to look at the effects of a 10-week stress management in-person&#xD;
      group program. The program will study emotions, stress, and stress management techniques&#xD;
      (such as relaxation and coping techniques) on quality of life, distress, depression, and&#xD;
      physical health in Spanish- speaking, Hispanic/Latino men diagnosed with Prostate Cancer&#xD;
      (PC).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 3, Baseline to Month 6, Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL will be measured using Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy - Prostate (FACT-P) including 4 domains of the FACT-General (FACT-G). The questionnaire has 39 items, with the total score ranging from 0-156. Higher scores indicate better function.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in HRQoL as measured by the PROMIS Pain questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 3, Baseline to Month 6, Baseline to Month 12</time_frame>
    <description>HRQoL will be measured using PROMIS short form for Pain Questionnaire. The items are item banks and the scoring via a computer adaptive testes (CAT) which use item response theory (IRT) to calculate a score that is transformed to a T score. Items are administered in an iterative approach where subsequent items are calibrated on prior ones. Once standard error reaches 2 or less, the CAT stops administering items. The higher the score the greater pain symptom.</description>
  </primary_outcome>

    <description>The Culturally Adapted Cognitive Behavioral Stress Management (C-CBSM) Intervention is a 10 weekly in-person group program. Each session will last about 90 minutes. The meetings will give facts on stress, coping with difficult events, managing anger, social support and stress reactions. Participants will also receive information on how to practice relaxation on their own. The delivery of C-CBSM places a greater emphasis on salient sociocultural determinants of symptom burden and Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) in Hispanics (e.g., fatalistic attitudes, family interdependence, perceived discrimination, machismo).</description>
