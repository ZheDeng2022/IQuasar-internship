    <textblock>
      Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (mTBI), including concussion, is a real public health problem.&#xD;
      Indeed mTBI might induce long-term brain disorders with increased risk of neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases and the healthcare costs can be significant for both the individual and the society.&#xD;
      However mTBI is called the &quot;silent epidemic&quot;, because of the lack of research in this field&#xD;
      in France as well as in the rest of the world. Most of the time, mTBI is associated with&#xD;
      sports injuries, road traffic accidents and falls. The risk of neurodegenerative diseases is&#xD;
      significantly increased with the repetition of mTBI, which may have a cumulative effect. In&#xD;
      this context, playing football (or 'soccer') is associated with a high risk of concussion and&#xD;
      with frequent head-ball contacts which are repeated during the training and matches.&#xD;
      Moreover, football is the most popular team sport in the world, with more than 265 million&#xD;
      players. The long-term impact of &quot;heading&quot; in football is still debated in the literature.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, several studies suggest the possible emergence of early neurocognitive&#xD;
      disorders. Otherwise, while mTBI is usually characterized by normal brain images using&#xD;
      traditional neuroimaging techniques, microscopic anatomical changes might be detectable by&#xD;
      new neuroimaging techniques. According to recent studies, cognitive dysfunctions could be&#xD;
      based on these microstructural changes in the gray matter and white matter, secondary to the&#xD;
      primary mechanical injury. Studies that have examined the structural changes in the brain&#xD;
      white matter in football players are rare and lack of evidence regarding the consequences of&#xD;
      accumulated brain impacts explains the lack of preventive measures in this sport. In&#xD;
      addition, post-traumatic secondary lesions cause functional alterations of the neurovascular&#xD;
      unit and its effect on cerebral perfusion may play a crucial role, which has never been yet&#xD;
      explored in humans over the long term.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research, the investigators will develop a unique multi-modal neuroimaging protocols&#xD;
      to assess brain changes after minor head trauma and over the time. Investigators want to&#xD;
      perform magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to assess cerebral blood flow using Arteria Spin&#xD;
      Labelling (ASL), structural changes using Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI), susceptibility&#xD;
      weighted imaging (SWI), and functional changes using BOLD resting-functional MRI.&#xD;
