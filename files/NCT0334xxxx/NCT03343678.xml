  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of BI&#xD;
      836826 in combination with venetoclax on the basis of dose limiting toxicities (DLTs&#xD;
      incidence rate during the MTD evaluation period of the combination treatment and to determine&#xD;
      the recommended Phase II dose (RP2D) of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other objectives are to evaluate the pharmacokinetics of BI 836826 in combination with&#xD;
      venetoclax and to further determine the safety, as well as to evaluate the efficacy of the&#xD;
      combination by means of the Complete Response (CR) rate and Minimal Residual Disease (MRD)&#xD;
      negativity rate.&#xD;
