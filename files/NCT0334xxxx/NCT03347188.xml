    <measure>DB Period: Mean Change From Baseline in Monthly Average Number of Headache Days of at Least Moderate Severity During the 12-Week Treatment Period After the First Dose of Fremanezumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -28 to Day -1), up to Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>A headache day was defined as a day when a participant reported a headache of at least moderate severity. Monthly averages were derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (number of days of efficacy variable over relevant period/number of days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The change was calculated as post-baseline value - baseline value. Least square (LS) mean was calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the duration of post traumatic headache history (less than 12 month since the brain injury or greater or equal to 12 month since the brain injury) and treatment as fixed effects and the baseline monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity as a covariate.</description>

    <measure>DB Period: Change From Baseline in Disability Score, as Measured by the 6-Item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) Total Score at Week 12 After the First Dose of Fremanezumab</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -28 to Day -1), Week 12</time_frame>
    <description>HIT-6 is a tool used to measure the impact headaches have on a participant's normal daily life and ability to function. The HIT-6 consists of 6 items, including pain, social functioning, role functioning, vitality, cognitive functioning, and psychological distress. Each item was answered on a 5-point Likert scale (6=never, 8=rarely, 10=sometimes, 11=very often, or 13=always), which were summed to produce a total score that ranged from 36 to 78, with larger scores reflecting greater impact of headache on the daily life of the participant.</description>

    <time_frame>Weeks 4, 8, and 12</time_frame>
    <description>The PGIC scale is a validated generic tool for the assessment of overall change in the severity of illness following treatment. Participants rated how they felt during assigned time points compared with how they felt before receiving study drug on a 7-point scale, where 1 = No change (or it got worse); 2 = Almost the same, hardly any change at all; 3 = A little better, but no noticeable change; 4 = Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference; 5 = Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change; 6 = Better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference; and 7 = A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference. Responders were those with a scale of 5 to 7 and non-responders were those with a scale of 1 to 4.</description>

        <title>DB Period: Mean Change From Baseline in Monthly Average Number of Headache Days of at Least Moderate Severity During the 12-Week Treatment Period After the First Dose of Fremanezumab</title>
        <description>A headache day was defined as a day when a participant reported a headache of at least moderate severity. Monthly averages were derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (number of days of efficacy variable over relevant period/number of days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The change was calculated as post-baseline value - baseline value. Least square (LS) mean was calculated using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) model with the duration of post traumatic headache history (less than 12 month since the brain injury or greater or equal to 12 month since the brain injury) and treatment as fixed effects and the baseline monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity as a covariate.</description>

        <population>Full analysis set (FAS) included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of the study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment on the primary endpoint.</population>

        <description>A headache day was defined as a day when a participant reported a headache of at least moderate severity. Monthly averages were derived and normalized to 28 days equivalent by the following formula: (number of days of efficacy variable over relevant period/number of days with assessments recorded in the e-diary over the relevant period) * 28. The change was calculated as post-baseline value - baseline value. LS mean was calculated using ANCOVA model with the duration of post traumatic headache history (less than 12 month since the brain injury or greater or equal to 12 month since the brain injury) and treatment as fixed effects and the baseline monthly average number of headache days of at least moderate severity as a covariate. This approach was used in generating the LS mean values only and was not considered to be an additional statistical analysis, no additional statistical analyses are reported for this outcome measure.</description>

        <title>DB Period: Change From Baseline in Disability Score, as Measured by the 6-Item Headache Impact Test (HIT-6) Total Score at Week 12 After the First Dose of Fremanezumab</title>
        <description>HIT-6 is a tool used to measure the impact headaches have on a participant's normal daily life and ability to function. The HIT-6 consists of 6 items, including pain, social functioning, role functioning, vitality, cognitive functioning, and psychological distress. Each item was answered on a 5-point Likert scale (6=never, 8=rarely, 10=sometimes, 11=very often, or 13=always), which were summed to produce a total score that ranged from 36 to 78, with larger scores reflecting greater impact of headache on the daily life of the participant.</description>

        <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of the study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment on the primary endpoint.

          <population>FAS included all randomized participants who received at least 1 dose of the study drug and had at least 1 post-baseline efficacy assessment on the primary endpoint. Here, 'Overall number of participants analyzed' signifies participants evaluable for this outcome measure.</population>

        <title>DB Period: Number of Participants (Responder and Non-Responder) With the Patient Global Impression of Change (PGIC) Scale at Weeks 4, 8, and 12 After the First Dose of Fremanezumab</title>
        <description>The PGIC scale is a validated generic tool for the assessment of overall change in the severity of illness following treatment. Participants rated how they felt during assigned time points compared with how they felt before receiving study drug on a 7-point scale, where 1 = No change (or it got worse); 2 = Almost the same, hardly any change at all; 3 = A little better, but no noticeable change; 4 = Somewhat better, but the change has not made any real difference; 5 = Moderately better, and a slight but noticeable change; 6 = Better, and a definite improvement that has made a real and worthwhile difference; and 7 = A great deal better, and a considerable improvement that has made all the difference. Responders were those with a scale of 5 to 7 and non-responders were those with a scale of 1 to 4.</description>

        <description>eC-SSRS is a questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation (severity and intensity) and behavior. Suicidal ideation: A series of 1 -5 questions (with 'yes' or 'no' response) with 5 types of ideation of increasing severity: 1. wish to be dead, 2. non-specific active suicidal thoughts, 3. active suicidal ideation with any methods (not plan) without intent to act, 4. active suicidal ideation with some intent to act, without specific plan, 5. active suicidal ideation with specific plan and intent. A positive finding was defined as a 'yes' response to question 4 or 5.</description>
