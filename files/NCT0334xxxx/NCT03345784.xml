    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of adavosertib when given together&#xD;
      with external beam radiation therapy and cisplatin in treating patients with cervical,&#xD;
      vaginal, or uterine cancer. Adavosertib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some&#xD;
      of the enzymes needed for cell growth. External beam radiation therapy uses high energy&#xD;
      x-rays to kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as cisplatin,&#xD;
      work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by&#xD;
      stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving adavosertib, external&#xD;
      beam radiation therapy, and cisplatin may work better in treating patients with cervical,&#xD;
      vaginal, or uterine cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) and safety profile of adavosertib&#xD;
      (AZD1775) in combination with radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin in patients with&#xD;
      gynecological cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the acute and late toxicity of AZD1775 when administered to patients with&#xD;
      gynecological cancer in combination with standard radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the pharmacodynamic effects of AZD1775 when administered in combination with&#xD;
      radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin (in particular, for the 15 patients treated in an&#xD;
      expansion cohort at the RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To obtain preliminary information about the progression-free survival, as defined by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 or clinical progression, of AZD1775&#xD;
      in combination with standard radiotherapy and concurrent cisplatin in women with&#xD;
      gynecological cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of adavosertib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo external beam radiation therapy on days 1-5 and receive adavosertib orally&#xD;
      (PO) on days 1, 3, and 5 or once daily (QD) on days 1-5 and cisplatin intravenously (IV) over&#xD;
      1 hour on day 1 or 3. Cycles repeat each week for up to 5 weeks in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression of unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and then every 4&#xD;
      months for 2 years.&#xD;

          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received any radiotherapy or chemotherapy for their current&#xD;
             gynecological cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received prior pelvic radiotherapy for any indication&#xD;
&#xD;

             Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 470 msec (as calculated per institutional standards)&#xD;
             obtained from 3 electrocardiograms (ECGs) 2-5 minutes apart at study entry, or&#xD;
             congenital long QT syndrome; AZD1775 should not be given to patients who have a&#xD;
             history of Torsades de pointes unless all risk factors contributed to Torsades have&#xD;
             been corrected; AZD1775 has not been studied in patients with ventricular arrhythmias&#xD;
             or recent myocardial infarction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients requiring para-aortic radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents or anticancer therapy&#xD;
             concurrently or within 4 weeks (i.e. 28 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to AZD1775 or cisplatin&#xD;

             within 6 months, congestive heart failure, symptomatic congestive heart failure,&#xD;
             unstable angina pectoris, active cardiomyopathy, unstable ventricular arrhythmia,&#xD;

             active peptic ulcer disease, active liver disease or cerebrovascular disease with&#xD;
             previous stroke, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance&#xD;
             with study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because AZD1775 and chemoradiation are&#xD;
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects; because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with AZD1775 and cisplatin, breastfeeding must be discontinued&#xD;
             if the mother is treated with AZD1775 and cisplatin; these potential risks may also&#xD;
             apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive patients on combination antiretroviral&#xD;
             therapy are ineligible because of the potential for pharmacokinetic interactions with&#xD;
             AZD1775; in addition, these patients are at increased risk of lethal infections when&#xD;
             treated with marrow-suppressive therapy; appropriate studies will be undertaken in&#xD;
             patients receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of active clinically significant bleeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of bowel obstruction or malabsorption syndromes (within the last 3 months)&#xD;
