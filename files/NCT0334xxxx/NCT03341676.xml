  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      When the brain detects a drop in oxygen levels in the blood (hypoxia) there is a compensatory&#xD;
      increase in blood flow. Acute mountain sickness (AMS) is a cluster of symptoms which commonly&#xD;
      occur in those ascending to high altitude and experiencing hypoxia due to increased blood&#xD;
      flow and then swelling in the brain. Symptoms include headache, nausea, insomnia and fatigue.&#xD;
      The exact mechanisms by which AMS develops remains poorly understood. Dexamethasone has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the risk of developing significant brain swelling in other settings.&#xD;
      Therefore we hypothesise that administering low dose Dexamethasone could protect against&#xD;
      hypoxia induced cerebral and spinal oedema.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The exact mechanisms by which AMS develops remains poorly understood. Interestingly, brain&#xD;
      and spinal cord swelling due to low oxygen levels can also occur in the period following&#xD;
      surgery to treat thoracic and abdominal aortic aneurysms, dangerous swellings of the major&#xD;
      blood vessel in the body. Therefore, if we find a therapeutic benefit of receiving a dose of&#xD;
      Dexamethasone in a controlled, reversible setting of hypoxia, it is possible that this could&#xD;
      be useful in the treatment of post-operative hypoxia as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work with MRI imaging has demonstrated reduced measures of water movement in patients&#xD;
      suffering from cerebral or spinal ischaemia, due to swelling. Specific water channels in&#xD;
      brain cells (astrocytes) are involved in the movement of water, and Dexamethasone has been&#xD;
      shown to reduce expression of these channels in animal models. Dexamethasone already plays a&#xD;
      role in lowering pressure in the brain in the setting of brain tumours. Although high doses&#xD;
      are typically used in this setting, there is evidence that lower doses may be equally&#xD;
      effective, especially in patients with less severe swelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be consented and randomised in the weeks before the actual study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before entering the tent, the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lake Louise Acute Mountain Sickness self-assessment questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulse oximetry&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-invasive cardiac monitoring (ECG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  End tidal CO2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Venous blood collection (Full blood count, renal function, S100 and GFAP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Finger-prick blood collection (Purines)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Magnetic Resonance Angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive monitoring will continue every 2 hours at the start of the study and around the&#xD;
      time of administration of the study drug. They will continue at less frequent intervals&#xD;
      throughout the study period. This includes ECG trace and an AMS self-assessment&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous sampling will be performed on 5 occasions throughout the study. Finger prick sampling&#xD;
      will be done at the same time points&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will have 5 MRI scans during the course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be begin hypoxication 1 hour after entering the tent. They will be returned to&#xD;
      normal oxygen levels after 24 hours.&#xD;
