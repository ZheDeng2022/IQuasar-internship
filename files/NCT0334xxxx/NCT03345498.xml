  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Entecavir (ETV) and tenofovir (TDF) are the first-line drugs for treatment of chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. Chronic HBV infection gradually progress to liver&#xD;
      cirrhosis. Over time, as liver damage and cirrhosis advance, the illness progress to a stage&#xD;
      termed as decompensated cirrhosis, characterized by development of one or more of serious,&#xD;
      life-threatening complications (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding or&#xD;
      jaundice). In HBV related decompensated cirrhosis, antiviral treatment is shown to provide&#xD;
      benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For HBV related decompensated cirrhosis, EVT is the drug of choice as it has been shown to be&#xD;
      effective and safe. The usual dose of ETV for chronic HBV infection is 0.5 mg orally once&#xD;
      daily. Somehow, the recommended dose of ETV for decompensated cirrhosis has been 1.0 mg/d.&#xD;
      The literature provides no justification for using this double dose of ETV. Since 0.5 mg&#xD;
      daily works well in other stages of disease, there is little reason why it should not work&#xD;
      well even in treatment-naïve decompensated cirrhosis. Considering the limitations of&#xD;
      available literature, physicians' are divided in their opinion about the drug dose and are&#xD;
      prescribing either of the two doses of ETV for this group. Hence, there is a need to assess&#xD;
      whether the usual 0.5 mg/d of ETV would work as well as the 1.0 mg/d dose of ETV in&#xD;
      decompensated cirrhosis due to HBV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators planned this open-labeled observational study with objective to compare the&#xD;
      efficacy of HBV suppression achieved using 0.5 mg daily and 1.0 mg daily of ETV in&#xD;
      HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis by comparing the mean reduction in HBV DNA level from&#xD;
      baseline after 24 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In present study investigators propose to enroll 15 participants in each group who has been&#xD;
      started on either doses (0.5 mg and 1.0 mg) of entecavir and measure serum HBV DNA levels in&#xD;
      blood specimens (5 ml) will be collected at different time points, i.e. at baseline, 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12 and 24 weeks after starting entecavir.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Chronic infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV), if untreated, may progress to&#xD;
      liver cirrhosis, portal hypertension and hepatocellular carcinoma. Currently, oral&#xD;
      administration of one of the nucleos(t)ide analogues (NAs) is the preferred treatment for&#xD;
      chronic HBV infection. Of the five NAs approved for HBV treatment, lamivudine, adefovir and&#xD;
      telbivudine are no longer preferred, and the recent guidelines from all three major&#xD;
      international liver disease associations [American Association for the Study of Liver Disease&#xD;
      (AASLD), European Association for Study of Liver (EASL), and Asia-Pacific Association for&#xD;
      Study of Liver (APASL)] recommend the use of either entecavir (ETV) or tenofovir (TDF) as&#xD;
      first-line drugs, because of their lower propensity to induce drug-resistant mutants and&#xD;
      hence better efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic liver disease due to any cause gradually progress to liver cirrhosis. Over time,&#xD;
      liver damage and cirrhosis advances to a stage termed as decompensated cirrhosis,&#xD;
      characterized by development of one or more of serious, life-threatening complications&#xD;
      (ascites, hepatic encephalopathy, variceal bleeding or jaundice). Treatment of HBV infection&#xD;
      with anti-viral drugs, in presence of decompensated cirrhosis, is beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In presence of HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis, EVT is the drug of choice as it has been&#xD;
      shown to be effective and safe. The usual dose of ETV for chronic HBV infection is 0.5 mg&#xD;
      orally once daily. Somehow, the recommended dose of ETV in presence of decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis has been 1.0 mg/d. The literature provides little direct justification for using&#xD;
      this double dose of ETV. Possibly, initially, ETV was used empirically in this dose to&#xD;
      achieve a rapid HBV suppression in this high-risk group with prior exposure to lamivudine in&#xD;
      advanced liver disease. However, since 0.5 mg daily works well in other stages of disease,&#xD;
      there is little reason why it should not work well even in treatment-naïve decompensated&#xD;
      cirrhosis. On the other hand, use of this higher dose of ETV adds to cost, a major&#xD;
      consideration in areas where medical expenses are mostly met with out of the pocket expenses.&#xD;
      Hene, in view of above-mentioned limitations of available literature, opinion of physicians&#xD;
      is divided and either of the two doses of ETV is used in HBV related decompensated cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, there is a need to assess whether the usual 0.5 mg/d of ETV would work as well as the&#xD;
      1.0 mg/d dose of ETV in decompensated cirrhosis due to HBV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Entecavir treatment in a dose of 0.5 mg once daily and of 1.0 mg daily have comparable&#xD;
      antiviral efficacy in HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the efficacy of HBV suppression achieved using 0.5 mg daily and 1.0 mg daily of&#xD;
      ETV in HBV-related decompensated cirrhosis by comparing the reduction in HBV DNA level from&#xD;
      baseline till up to 24 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open-label administration of 0.5 mg or 1.0 mg daily of entecavir for 24 weeks with comparison&#xD;
      of mean reduction in HBV DNA levels from baseline in participants receiving the two dose&#xD;
      schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with decompensated liver cirrhosis and replicative HBV infection (HBsAg&#xD;
      positive, serum HBV DNA titer &gt;100,000 IU/mL) will be enrolled, irrespective of their HBeAg&#xD;
      and anti-HBe test results. Diagnosis of cirrhosis will be based on a combination of typical&#xD;
      clinical, biochemical, radiological and endoscopic findings. Hepatic decompensation will be&#xD;
      defined according to the most recent definition of APASL which defines it as significant&#xD;
      liver dsyfunction as indicated by (i) raised serum bilirubin (more than 2.5 times the upper&#xD;
      limit of normal) and prolonged prothrombin time (prolonged by more than 3 s or international&#xD;
      normalized ratio &gt;1.5) or (ii) occurrence of ascites or (iii) hepatic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with one or more of the following features will be excluded: (i) prior exposure&#xD;
      to NAs or other specific treatment for HBV infection (e.g. pegylated interferon), (ii)&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, (iii) co-infection with any other hepatotropic viruses or HIV, (iv)&#xD;
      acute-on-chronic liver failure as defined by the criteria laid down by Asia-Pacific&#xD;
      Association for the Study of Liver, (iv) significant alcohol intake or another concomitant&#xD;
      hepatobiliary disease, (v) expected survival below 4 weeks (e.g. hemodynamic instability,&#xD;
      active sepsis, hepatorenal syndrome, etc), (vi) use of immunosuppressive medication or (vii)&#xD;
      portal vein thrombosis. Also, a participant who is not in a position to return for the&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up visits will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment and consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will consider to enroll the participants with HBV related decompensated cirrhosis and is&#xD;
      planned for treatment, based on their clinical conditions, with either 0.5 or 1.0 mg daily&#xD;
      doses of Entecavir by their treating physician. For those who agree to participate (by&#xD;
      signing an informed consent), clinical and laboratory findings (including baseline HBV DNA&#xD;
      level) will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up and outcome measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood specimens (5 ml) will be collected at different time points, i.e. at baseline, 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12 and 24 weeks after starting Entecavir. Serum will be separated and stored at -80C till&#xD;
      analysis. In each specimen, HBV DNA will then be assessed using a quantitative real-time PCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is proposed to enroll 15 participants in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rate of decline in HBV DNA levels with time will be compared between groups, using&#xD;
      methods for longitudinal data analysis.&#xD;
