      This is a phase II, open label, randomised trial of ipilimumab and nivolumab with concurrent&#xD;
      intracranial stereotactic radiotherapy versus ipilimumab and nivolumab alone in patients with&#xD;
      asymptomatic, untreated melanoma brain metastases.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      1. BACKGROUND The ABC study (NCT02374242) is a phase II clinical trial recruiting 3 cohorts&#xD;
           of patients with melanoma brain metastases. 76 patients received immunotherapy with&#xD;
           either nivolumab alone or nivolumab combined with ipilimumab. Nivolumab together with&#xD;
           ipilimumab was shown to be more effective than nivolumab alone in melanoma brain&#xD;
           metastases. The combination will therefore be used in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Findings from pre-clinical and clinical research provides evidence supporting the&#xD;
           ability of radiotherapy to induce anti-tumour immune responses and augment the efficacy&#xD;
           of anti-PD1 checkpoint blockade in melanoma and provide mechanistic rationale for&#xD;
           combined therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN This current protocol builds on the ABC study and will assess clinical,&#xD;
           functional, toxicities and quality of life outcomes with the combined modalities of&#xD;
           immunotherapy with radiotherapy to the brain in melanoma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The main aim of this study will be to assess the effect of immunotherapy +/- concurrent&#xD;
           stereotactic radiotherapy (SRS) on the intracranial death rate at 12 months from the&#xD;
           commencement of treatment. Secondary aims include the RECIST response in the brain,&#xD;
           extracranially and overall, progression free survival, overall survival, neurocognitive&#xD;
           function, adverse event rates and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The study will recruit 218 patients with asymptomatic, untreated melanoma brain&#xD;
           metastases. All patients will be treated with combination ipilimumab and nivolumab at&#xD;
           the doses and duration approved by worldwide regulatory authorities for advanced&#xD;
           melanoma. All patients will undergo the the SRS treatment planning MRI of the brain&#xD;
           PRIOR to randomisation to ensure that the timing of the baseline intracranial&#xD;
           measurements are made within a similar timeframe and so that the delineation of tumour&#xD;
           volume is accurately recorded in the same way for both cohorts. Patents will be&#xD;
           randomised to receive concurrent intracranial SRS (within 7 days of the baseline /&#xD;
           planning MRI scan) or immunotherapy alone. At intracranial disease progression, any form&#xD;
           of salvage local therapy (radiotherapy or surgery) may be administered to either cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomisation is 1:1, using a permuted, random block design with stratification by&#xD;
           participating centre, LDH (normal / elevated), BRAF (mutant / wild type), 1-2 brain&#xD;
           metastases versus &gt; 2 brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. PRIMARY OUTCOME The neurological specific death rate at 12 months - defined as a&#xD;
           proximate cause of death which is a sign, symptom, or diagnosis related to metastatic&#xD;
           brain disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. OBJECTIVE RESPONSES A modified version of RECIST will be used to assess response to&#xD;
           treatment. The modification allows for up to 5 brain metastastes to be selected as&#xD;
           target lesions and a further 5 extracranial lesions. The immune related response&#xD;
           criteria (irRC) will also be applied and concordance evaluated with RECIST. The irRC&#xD;
           measures the volume of tumour lesions by calculating bi-dimensional measurements of&#xD;
           target lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. NEUROCOGNITIVE ASSESSMENT, FUNCTION AND QUALITY OF LIFE Neurocognitive impairment is a&#xD;
           concern in the setting of radiotherapy delivered for brain metastases. The addition of&#xD;
           immunotherapy for enhanced local disease control and survival may augment the risks.&#xD;
           Quality of life (QoL) assessment is therefore an important objective in clinical trials&#xD;
           studying the effects of new interventions, where side effects and tolerability are as&#xD;
           important as clinical benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neurocognitive function will be assessed at baseline and every 6 to 12 weeks using the&#xD;
           Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and a neurological assessment of the patient. A&#xD;
           member of the study team will be nominated to conduct the MoCA to allow for consistency&#xD;
           of delivery of the examination. The MoCA measures six cognitive domains:&#xD;
           visuospatial/executive function; naming; memory; language; abstraction; and attention.&#xD;
           To decrease the learning effect from multiple administrations of the MoCA over a short&#xD;
           period of time, alternate versions have been made available.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy (FACT) questionnaires are commonly used to&#xD;
           assess cancer-related QoL issues. The FACT-Brain (FACT-Br) module provides an additional&#xD;
           set of disease-specific questions pertaining to brain neoplasms and is completed by the&#xD;
           patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Neurological assessments wil be made using the structured NANO scale at each physical&#xD;
           examination - each neurological domain is subdivided into 3 or 4 levels of function with&#xD;
           scores based on discrete quantifiable measures. Thus, levels of function for each domain&#xD;
           range from 0 to 2 or 0 to 3. A score of 0 indicates normal function, while the highest&#xD;
           score indicates the most severe level of deficit for that domain. Levels of function are&#xD;
           distinguished by significant and measurable differences in order to avoid&#xD;
           misinterpretation of subtle or nonspecific changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The EORTC QLQ-C30, an internationally validated cancer-specific QOL-instrument, assesses&#xD;
           various facets of functioning, symptoms common in cancer patients and global QOL. The&#xD;
           Brain Cancer Module (EORTC QLQ-BN20 is a 20-item supplement for the QLQ-C30 to assess&#xD;
           neurological related quality of life and neurological symptoms and is being utilised in&#xD;
           the main ABC study. Among the symptoms captured by neurocognitive tests are&#xD;
           communication deficits and memory problems. In these cases, a patient-rated QoL tool may&#xD;
           not capture the true effects of the disease or the intervention to treat it. Both C30&#xD;
           and BN20 modules have been validated for assessing health-related quality of life and&#xD;
           symptoms in patients with brain cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
           General health status will also be measured using the EQ-5D. The EQ-5D is a standardized&#xD;
           instrument for use as a measure of self-reported health status. The EQ-5D comprises 5&#xD;
           dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety) and a&#xD;
           visual analogue rating scale (VAS). The utility data generated from the EQ-5D is&#xD;
           commonly used in cost effectiveness analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. TOXICITY AND TOLERABILITY Adverse events will be reported using the CTCAE version 5.0 in&#xD;
           addition to causality, duration, treatment required and the need for treatment delays or&#xD;
           discontinuation. Radionecrosis is an event of clinical interest and will be captured&#xD;
           separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. CORRELATIVE BLOOD AND TISSUE BIOMARKER STUDIES Some patients may not benefit from&#xD;
           radiation therapy and immunotherapy combinations. Therefore, biomarkers predictive of&#xD;
           response. or the lack of it are needed. Extensive correlative analyses of tumoural and&#xD;
           peripheral blood immunologic changes will be essential to a better understanding of the&#xD;
           mechanistic interactions between these 2 treatment modalities. The differential&#xD;
           composition of the gut microbiome has been shown to affect antitumor immunity and&#xD;
           immunotherapy efficacy and will also be correlated with response and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To address this, blood, tissue, stool and urine samples will be obtained. Blood will be&#xD;
           collected at baseline, at 1 week of treatment and then 6 to 12 weekly to examine serum&#xD;
           chemokines, cytokines, inflammatory markers, lymphocyte and T cell subsets and myeloid&#xD;
           derived suppressor cells and to assess correlation with disease response or progression.&#xD;
           All Cohorts will be included in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In patients with sufficient archival melanoma tissue from metastatic sites, a baseline&#xD;
           tumour PD-L1 level, immune markers and genetics of response and resistance will also be&#xD;
           measured. If available, tumour tissue following progression of accessible extracranial&#xD;
           disease and / or craniotomy will also be tested for immune and genetic markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Stool samples will be obtained at baseline, at weeks 6 and 12 and at the end of&#xD;
           immunotherapy to investigate the gut microbiome composition, diversity and abundance and&#xD;
           correlation with the response to immunotherapy and immune-related gastrointestinal&#xD;
           toxicity. A baseline evaluation of participants' dietary habits will also be included in&#xD;
           these analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A reduction in intestinal barrier function is currently believed to play an important&#xD;
           role in pathogenesis of many diseases, response to immunotherapy and immune related&#xD;
           toxicity. Urinary excretion of two orally-administered non-metabolizable sugars,&#xD;
           lactulose and mannitol, is a valuable marker for evaluating intestinal permeability.&#xD;
           Patients will collect a urine specimen at baseline to assess this biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. CONTINUED SYSTEMIC TREATMENT IN CASES OF PROGRESSIVE DISEASE&#xD;
&#xD;
           The application of traditional RECIST criteria (Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid&#xD;
           Tumors) in patients treated with immunotherapy may lead to premature discontinuation of&#xD;
           treatment in a patient who will eventually respond to treatment or have prolonged&#xD;
           disease stabilization. Disease progression may occur in extracranial lesions whilst&#xD;
           patients may continue to have disease stabilisation or response of their intracranial&#xD;
           melanoma disease, and vice versa. The patterns of response to treatment with these&#xD;
           immunotherapy agents differ from those with molecularly targeted agents or cytotoxic&#xD;
           chemotherapy in several important respects:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patients may have a transient worsening of disease, manifested either by&#xD;
                progression of known lesions or the appearance of new lesions, before disease&#xD;
                stabilizes or tumour regresses. Therefore caution should be taken in abandoning&#xD;
                therapy early. In general these delayed responses are not observed in patients with&#xD;
                rapidly progressive, symptomatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Responses can take appreciably longer to become apparent compared with cytotoxic&#xD;
                therapy. Continued disease regression is frequently observed well after completion&#xD;
                of the initial induction period.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Some patients who do not meet traditional criteria for objective response can have&#xD;
                prolonged periods of stable disease that are clinically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An evaluation of data from ipilimumab phase II clinical trials in advanced melanoma&#xD;
           found patients characterized as PD at week 12 (by WHO criteria), either by an increase&#xD;
           in tumour burden and/or the appearance of new lesions, subsequently experienced an&#xD;
           objective response or SD (relative to baseline) without the addition of non-ipilimumab&#xD;
           anticancer therapy. Examination of biopsies taken from patients receiving ipilimumab&#xD;
           demonstrated that in some small unmeasurable lesions noted at baseline, an increase in&#xD;
           size may be interpreted as PD, when instead, this may be due to inflammation due to T&#xD;
           cell infiltration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. CONTINUED TREATMENT WITH NIVOLUMAB Patients who are found to have RECIST defined&#xD;
           intracranial or extracranial progression (or both) from 6 weeks onwards, and who do not&#xD;
           have clinical signs or symptoms of progression, may continue on nivolumab and must have&#xD;
           a confirmatory scan within 4 to 6 weeks. The date of the original assessment of&#xD;
           progression will be used to record progression, and not the date of the confirmatory&#xD;
           imaging. Continued immunotherapy treatment is permitted if the treating clinician&#xD;
           determines that the patient is still clinically benefiting from immunotherapy and the&#xD;
           patient is willing to continue drug treatment. Consideration may be given to stable or&#xD;
           good response extra- or intra- cranially with concurrent progression in the other as a&#xD;
           scenario that may warrant further treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is growing evidence that patients may not need to be treated with immunotherapies&#xD;
      indefinitely, or even for as long as the two years commonly studied in clinical trials.&#xD;
      Rather, shorter courses of treatment may be just as effective and provide an option for&#xD;
      retreatment should a patient progress after coming off a defined period of therapy. Patients&#xD;
      who receive 2 years of immunotherapy have the option to cease treatment at this stage, with&#xD;
      an option for a rechallenge of immunotherapy at the time of disease progression, if this&#xD;
      occurs with 2 years of initial cessation.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Female or male patients, ≥18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Signed, written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. AJCC Stage IV [any T, any N, M1d (0) or M1D(1)] histologically confirmed cutaneous,&#xD;
             acral or mucosal unresectable melanoma or unknown primary melanoma and at least 1&#xD;
             radiological definitive brain metastasis that is ≥ 5mm and ≤40mm, measurable per&#xD;
             RECIST version 1.1 guidelines (modified for brain metastases, enabling up to 5 target&#xD;
             lesions in the brain as well as up to 5 extracranial target lesions). There is no&#xD;
             upper limit restriction in the number of brain metastases, provided the remaining&#xD;
             eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The BRAF mutation status must be available prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The treating clinician(s) should consider the intracranial disease amenable to&#xD;
             stereotactic radiotherapy over whole brain radiotherapy. Patients for whom there is a&#xD;
             definite and immediate indication for radiotherapy (e.g. rapidly progressing disease&#xD;
             with associated clinical signs and /or symptoms) should not be considered for&#xD;
             enrolment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Brain metastases must be untreated with any modality of radiotherapy or systemic&#xD;
             treatment. Previous surgery for melanoma brain metastases is permitted if it resulted&#xD;
             in gross total resection and no radiotherapeutic cavity boost was required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. No prior systemic treatment for brain metastases is permitted unless given in the&#xD;
             neoadjuvant or adjuvant settings for systemic drug the treatment for extracranial&#xD;
             disease only. At the time of neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic therapy for extracranial&#xD;
             disease, there should be radiological evidence of the absence of brain metastases. The&#xD;
             presenting diagnosis of brain metastases at the time of enrolment in this study must&#xD;
             have occurred a minimum of 6 months after stopping neoadjuvant or adjuvant systemic&#xD;
             therapy (prior anti PD1, anti PD-L1, anti CTLA-4, BRAF / MEK inhibitors or clinical&#xD;
             trial agents) are acceptable in the setting of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Asymptomatic from brain metastases at the time of study enrolment without&#xD;
             corticosteroids, analgesia or any other treatment for the management of neurological&#xD;
             symptoms (with the exception of antiepileptics prescribed for any reason, provided&#xD;
             patient is asymptomatic). Resolved neurological symptoms are permitted if complete&#xD;
             resolution, without any intervention, has been sustained for a minimum of 7 days prior&#xD;
             to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status of 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A life expectancy &gt; 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Able to undergo MRI with Gadolinium contrast agent. CT of the brain is not an&#xD;
             acceptable alternative should patients be unable to safely undergo a contrast MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Adequate haematological, hepatic and renal organ function as defined by:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. White cell count ≥ 2.0 × 10x9/L&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Neutrophil count ≥ 1.5 × 10x9/L&#xD;

&#xD;
               8. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 x the upper limit of normal (ULN). If serum creatinine is&#xD;
                  &gt; 1.5 x ULN, calculate creatinine clearance using standard Cockcroft-Gault&#xD;
                  formula. Creatinine clearance must be 40ml/min to be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Women of childbearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 7 days of the first dose of study treatment and agree to use effective&#xD;

&#xD;
             Women who are not of childbearing potential are defined as any female who has had a&#xD;
             documented hysterectomy, bilateral oophorectomy or bilateral tubal ligation or any&#xD;
             female who is post-menopausal (≥ one year without menses and &gt;50 years of age in the&#xD;
             absence of hormone replacement therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Men with any female partner of childbearing potential must agree to use effective&#xD;
             contraception from 14 days prior to commencing study treatment, throughout the&#xD;
             treatment period and for 31 weeks* after the last dose of study treatment. Effective&#xD;
             contraception includes:&#xD;

                  hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  These durations have been calculated using the upper limit of the half-life&#xD;
                       for nivolumab (25 days) and are based on the protocol requirement that WOCBP&#xD;
                       use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 30 days and men who are sexually&#xD;
                       active with WOCBP use contraception for 5 half-lives plus 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
