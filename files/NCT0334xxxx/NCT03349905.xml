    <textblock>
      Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) enhances the efficacy of ART (Assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technology) by permitting multiple-oocyte yields, but also alters endometrial receptivity&#xD;
      (ER) by an advancement of endometrial development which contributes to diminished pregnancy&#xD;
      chances. Previous reports suggest that pregnancy rates are increased following deferred&#xD;
      frozen embryo transfers. In addition as compared to fresh embryo transfers, frozen embryo&#xD;
      transfers seem to be associated with less affected perinatal outcomes, in particular lower&#xD;
      risk of preterm birth, small for gestational age and caesarean section. Unfortunately, most&#xD;
      of the current evidence is based only on preliminary reports, needing further scientific&#xD;
      evidence. Thus, whether differing embryo transfers could restore optimal ER leading to higher&#xD;
      live birth rate (LBR) and better obstetrical outcomes as compared to fresh embryo transfers,&#xD;
      is actually still under investigation.&#xD;

      Controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) enhances the efficacy of ART (Assisted reproductive&#xD;
      technology) by permitting multiple-oocyte yields, but also alters endometrial receptivity&#xD;
      (ER) by an advancement of endometrial development which contributes to diminished pregnancy&#xD;
      chances. Recently, technical improvements in vitrification make frozen embryo transfers&#xD;
      (FETs) a safe and feasible alternative to fresh embryo transfer (Evans et al., 2014). In case&#xD;
      of FET the absence of COS avoid the alteration of endometrial receptivity. Previous reports&#xD;
      suggest that pregnancy rates are increased and perinatal outcomes are less affected following&#xD;
      FET (Evans et al., 2014). In fact previous studies plead for increased risk of preterm birth,&#xD;
      small for gestational age, caesarean section after fresh embryo transfer as compared to&#xD;
      frozen embryo transfer (Maheshwari et al., 2012). Unfortunately, most of the current evidence&#xD;
      is based only on preliminary reports, needing further scientific evidence. Thus, one of the&#xD;
      main questions, in the management of infertile women, is to know whether differing embryo&#xD;
      transfers could restore optimal endometrial receptivity leading to higher live birth rate&#xD;
      (LBR) and better obstetrical outcomes as compared to fresh embryo transfer. This question is&#xD;
      actually debated in the literature in many different reviews (Blockeel et al., 2016; Cedars,&#xD;
      2016; Engmann et al., 2016; Evans et al., 2014; Roque, 2015). However even if the scientific&#xD;
      rationale is in favour of increased pregnancy rates after differed FET, compelling clinical&#xD;
      evidence is still lacking and most of the current evidence is based on retrospective and&#xD;
      uncontrolled studies. Currently the best evidence come from a very recent randomized control&#xD;
      trial of fresh versus frozen embryo transfers in a specific population of polycystic ovary&#xD;
      syndrome affected women (Chen et al., 2016). The authors failed to show any difference in&#xD;
      pregnancy rate after fresh versus frozen embryo transfers but they found higher rate of&#xD;
      miscarriages after fresh embryo transfers and in consequence a slight but significant&#xD;
      decrease in live birth after fresh as compared to frozen embryo transfers (Chen et al.,&#xD;
      2016). However whether these results, coming from a specific population of polycystic ovary&#xD;
      syndrome affected women, may be generalizable is actually still unknown. Furthermore some&#xD;
      evidence come from a meta-analysis, including 3 randomized studies. The conclusions of this&#xD;
      meta-analysis are that IVF outcomes may be improved by performing FET compared with fresh&#xD;
      embryo transfer probably through an improvement of endometrial receptivity (Roque et al.,&#xD;
      2013). Nevertheless, this meta-analysis should be interpreted with caution. One of the&#xD;
      included studies had been retracted from literature because of methodological problem&#xD;
      (Aflatoonian et al., 2010). Therefore, this meta-analysis banking on a retracted study seems&#xD;
      no more valid and therefore its conclusions remained uncertain. Even in absence of solid&#xD;
      clinical studies and even in absence of valid recommendations, some authors conclude that IVF&#xD;
      outcomes can be improved using the freeze-all policy with differed FET (Roque et al., 2015).&#xD;
      In addition they recommend that further randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the&#xD;
      advantage of this strategy and determine the population for which it would be most&#xD;
      beneficial. This last point seems crucial as ART procedures (IVF-ICSI) encompass a mixture of&#xD;
      different fertility problem more or less sensible to the effects of COS on endometrial&#xD;
      receptivity. Among the different causes of infertility, endometriosis is quite common and up&#xD;
      to 20 % of women undergoing ART have associated endometriosis (Kawwass et al., 2015;&#xD;
      Kuivasaari-Pirinen et al., 2012; Senapati et al., 2016). In addition endometriosis is&#xD;
      characterized by impaired endometrial receptivity, contributing to the mechanisms by which&#xD;
      endometriosis interfere with fecundity (de Ziegler et al., 2010). Estimated prevalence of&#xD;
      endometriosis range from 2 to 10% of women of reproductive age, to 50% of infertile women&#xD;
      (Eskenazi and Warner, 1997; Meuleman et al., 2009). Reverting to ART in case of endometriosis&#xD;
      related infertility remain a solid option. However recent meta-analysis evocates decreased&#xD;
      live birth rate in case of severe endometriosis as compared to disease free women (Hamdan et&#xD;
      al., 2015). In addition endometriosis may be associated to adverse obstetrical outcomes&#xD;
      (Leone Roberti Maggiore et al., 2016). Thus, given the existence of altered endometrial&#xD;
      receptivity in endometriosis, and diminished ART outcomes, it is actually also debated&#xD;
      whether deferring embryo transfers could restore optimal endometrial receptivity leading to&#xD;
      higher live birth rate and reduced obstetrical risk in endometriosis affected women.&#xD;
