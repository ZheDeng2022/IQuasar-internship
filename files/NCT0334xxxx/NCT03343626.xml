  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to describe the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of two&#xD;
      doses of purified inactivated Zika virus vaccine (PIZV) given 28 days apart. Three different&#xD;
      vaccine doses containing different protein concentrations (2, 5 or 10 microgram [mcg]) each,&#xD;
      will be given as 2 dose schedule to flavivirus naive and primed healthy adults. Participants&#xD;
      will be followed for 7 days post each dose for tolerability and up to 6 months post dose 2&#xD;
      for safety. Immunogenicity assessment will be performed at 28 days post each dose and 6&#xD;
      months post dose 2. In addition, the selected dose group and control group will be followed&#xD;
      till 24 months post dose 2 for safety and persistence of immunity.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The vaccine being tested in this study is called PIZV or TAK-426 adjuvanted with aluminum&#xD;
      hydroxide. The Zika virus vaccine is being tested to provide safety and immunogenicity data&#xD;
      to enable the vaccine to be further developed clinically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll approximately 240 participants. Participants will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (by chance, like flipping a coin) to one of the four groups-which will remain undisclosed to&#xD;
      the study observer:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PIZV: 2 microgram (mcg) Low Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PIZV: 5 mcg Medium Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PIZV: 10 mcg High Dose&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be administered either placebo or PIZV by intramuscular (IM) injection&#xD;
      into the middle third of the deltoid muscle, preferably in the non-dominant arm on Days 1&#xD;
      (Visit 1) and 29 (Visit 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This multi-center trial will be conducted in the United States and Puerto Rico. The overall&#xD;
      time to participate in this study is up to 25 months. Participants will make multiple visits&#xD;
      to the clinic on Days 1, 8, 29, 36, 57, 211, 393 and will be contacted by telephone on Day&#xD;
      133 (Visit 7) and Day 575 (Visit 9) and also visit the clinic on Day 757 (Visit 11) depending&#xD;
      on the study arm, for a final follow-up assessment.&#xD;
