      An open-label Phase 1 trial to evaluate the safety and tolerability of MVA-BN-Brachyury&#xD;
      priming and FPV-Brachyury boost vaccines modified to express brachyury and T-cell&#xD;
      costimulatory molecules in patients with a metastatic or unresectable locally advanced&#xD;
      malignant solid tumor. Subjects will be given the following subcutaneous doses: two prime&#xD;
      doses with MVA-BN-Brachyury and monthly boost doses with FPV-Brachyury for 6 months. The&#xD;
      study will last approximately 104 weeks before starting long term follow up (FU).&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have a metastatic or unresectable locally advanced malignant solid&#xD;
             tumor, histologically confirmed by the Laboratory of Pathology, NCI. In the case of&#xD;
             chordoma, unresectable, locally recurrent, or metastatic tumors are acceptable for&#xD;
             enrollment, given that this represents incurable disease. Efforts will be made, as&#xD;
             much as possible, to enroll patients with tumor types with known increased expression&#xD;
             of brachyury (such as lung, breast, ovarian, prostate, colorectal, pancreatic,&#xD;
             hepatocellular, Merkel cell, small cell lung cancer or chordoma; other tumors may be&#xD;
             included as data on the level of brachyury in those tumors becomes available). Every&#xD;
             attempt will be made to collect archival tissue, preferably metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have measurable or nonmeasurable but evaluable disease. Patients with&#xD;
             surgically resected metastatic disease at high risk of relapse or patients with&#xD;
             metastatic disease with a complete response after palliative chemotherapy with at high&#xD;
             risk of relapse (such as small cell lung cancer, etc) are also eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy: Patients must have completed or had disease progression on at least one&#xD;
             prior line of disease-appropriate therapy for metastatic disease, or not be candidates&#xD;
             for therapy of proven efficacy for their disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There should be a minimum of 4 weeks from any prior chemotherapy, immunotherapy and/or&#xD;
             radiation, with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Prostate cancer - patients must continue to receive GnRH agonist therapy (unless&#xD;
                  orchiectomy has been done). Patients on combined androgen blockade therapy may&#xD;
                  continue those therapies as well (bicalutamide, nilutamide, flutamide,&#xD;
                  enzalutamide and abiraterone).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Breast cancer - patients may remain on hormonal therapy if indicated (ER/PR+),&#xD;
                  HER2-directed therapy for HER2+ breast cancer (3+ IHC or FISH+).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. EGFR-mutated lung cancer - patient may remain on first line EGFR inhibiting&#xD;
                  therapy (tyrosine kinase inhibitors) if they have had stable disease or ongoing&#xD;
                  response to therapy. Patients with T790M mutations may continue receiving&#xD;
                  osimertinib while receiving vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Mestastatic colorectal cancer may continue &quot;maintenance&quot; therapy with&#xD;
                  capecitabine and/or bevacizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There should be a minimum of 6 weeks from any prior antibody therapies, (such as&#xD;
             ipilimumab or anti-PD1/PDL1) due to prolonged half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered (grade 1 or baseline) from any clinically significant&#xD;
             toxicity associated with prior therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status ≤ 1 (Karnofsky ≥ 70%)&#xD;
&#xD;

             (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) prior to trial entry and for&#xD;
             the duration of trial participation and for a period of 4 months after the last&#xD;
             vaccination therapy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be able to understand and be willing to sign a written informed consent&#xD;
             document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment for cancer, with specific exceptions noted in inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic hepatitis B or C infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any significant disease that, in the opinion of the investigator, may impair the&#xD;
             patient's tolerance of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant dementia, altered mental status, or any psychiatric condition that would&#xD;
             prohibit the understanding or rendering of informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune diseases requiring treatment or a history of autoimmune disease that&#xD;
             might be stimulated by vaccine treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of systemic steroids, except for physiologic doses of systemic steroid&#xD;
             replacement or local (topical, nasal, or inhaled) steroid use. Limited pharmacologic&#xD;
             doses of systemic steroids (e.g., in patients with exacerbations of reactive airway&#xD;
             disease or to prevent I.V. contrast allergic reaction or anaphylaxis in patients who&#xD;
             have known contrast allergies) are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving any other investigational agents within 28 days before&#xD;
             start of trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with untreated central nervous system metastases or local treatment of brain&#xD;
             metastases within the last 6 months. Patients with stable brain metastasis for 6&#xD;
             months post-intervention are eligible. Subjects with chordoma will be eligible&#xD;
             regardless of site of disease if other eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to BN-Brachyury or other agents used in trial. History of allergic&#xD;
             reaction to aminoglycoside antibiotics or egg products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Serious or uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the investigator, would limit compliance with trial requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-positive patients.&#xD;
