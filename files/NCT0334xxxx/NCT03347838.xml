    <textblock>
      The goal of this clinical research study is to determine whether the PD-1 inhibitor&#xD;
      (Programmed cell death protein 1) nivolumab improves premalignant bronchial dysplastic&#xD;
      lesions in subjects that are at high risk for the development of lung cancer, including those&#xD;
      with a prior smoking history, or history of lung cancer or head and neck cancer. The safety&#xD;
      and tolerability of nivolumab will also be studied.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This is a single-institution, open-label, single-arm, two-stage, phase II study of the PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitor nivolumab in patients at high risk for lung cancer. Simon's two-stage design will&#xD;
      be used. In the first stage, 18 subjects will be enrolled. If at least 7 subjects respond to&#xD;
      nivolumab, then an additional 24 subjects will be enrolled for a total of 42 subjects. The&#xD;
      central hypothesis to be tested by this trial is that immune evasion contributes to malignant&#xD;
      transformation of premalignant bronchial dysplastic lesions into invasive lung cancers, and&#xD;
      that blocking PD-1 will allow the immune system to target and eradicate premalignant&#xD;
      bronchial dysplastic lesions, thereby preventing the development of lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab 240 mg IV will be administered every two weeks for a total of four doses (8 weeks).&#xD;
      Participants will undergo bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy at study entry, 2 months,&#xD;
      and 6 months. The primary endpoint will be change in bronchial dysplasia between study entry&#xD;
      and the 6 month timepoint. Secondary endpoints include safety and tolerability of nivolumab&#xD;
      in patients with bronchial dysplastic lesions, and additional endobronchial histology&#xD;
      endpoints. Exploratory endpoints will be used to identify predictive markers of response to&#xD;
      nivolumab.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint is the dichotomous endpoint of whether a subject responds to PD-1 immune checkpoint inhibition using nivolumab. Response will be based on the 6-month change (difference between 6-month score and baseline score) in worst (i.e., maximum) histologic classification score, using the 2004 World Health Organization (WHO) classification scale for pre-invasive squamous lesions of the bronchus. The histologic classification consists of: normal (grade 1.0), reserve cell hyperplasia (grade 2.0), squamous metaplasia (grade 3.0), mild dysplasia (grade 4.0), moderate dysplasia (grade 5.0), severe dysplasia (grade 6.0), carcinoma in situ (grade 7.0) and invasive cancer (grade 8.0).</description>

In particular, patients will be monitored closely for evidence of dermatological, gastrointestinal, endocrine, renal, and pulmonary irAEs. Complete blood count, comprehensive metabolic profile, and thyroid function tests will be obtained at baseline and every 3 months for 1 year. A comprehensive metabolic profile will also be checked every 2 weeks. Subjects will be followed for a total of 1 year to monitor for development of irAEs after discontinuation of the study drug.</description>
