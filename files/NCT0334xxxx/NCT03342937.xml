      This study will be conducted in two stages: 1) safety validation and 2) dose expansion&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Safety Validation Cohort: The first portion of the study will preliminarily establish&#xD;
           the tolerability of the combination of pembrolizumab, oxaliplatin and capecitabine. Five&#xD;
           (5) subjects will be enrolled and their safety data after 21 days of treatment will be&#xD;
           reviewed before additional subjects are enrolled. Subjects on this portion of the study&#xD;
           will only be enrolled at the Duke Cancer Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dose Expansion Cohort: The second portion of the study (ie. phase II) will enroll 30&#xD;
           subjects. In the dose expansion cohort, the first cycle will be modified to allow one&#xD;
           week of pembrolizumab monotherapy before starting capecitabine and oxaliplatin (XELOX)&#xD;
           chemotherapy, which will allow analysis of biomarkers related to pembrolizumab. Subjects&#xD;
           on this portion of the study will be enrolled at the Duke Cancer institute and select&#xD;
           external collaborating institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to describe the progression free survival (PFS)&#xD;
      associated with the combination of pembrolizumab, oxaliplatin and capecitabine (pembrolizumab&#xD;
      +XELOX) in all patients with previously untreated metastatic esophagogastric adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
