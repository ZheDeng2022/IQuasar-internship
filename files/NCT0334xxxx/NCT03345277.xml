  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Is it possible to detect infection before it is clinically apparent? Fever is one indicator&#xD;
      of infection. However, until recently, continuous temperature monitoring has not been&#xD;
      feasible. With the advent of microelectronics, long battery life, and wireless transmission,&#xD;
      it is now possible to continuously measure, record and report body temperature. For a period&#xD;
      of 90 days, residents of a long-term care facility will have their body temperature monitored&#xD;
      and then those measurements will then be compared against other available healthcare data&#xD;
      such as other recorded vital signs, nursing notes, provider visits, antibiotics, and&#xD;
      hospitalization records for correlation of underlying infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over 1.5 million people live in 16,000 nursing homes (NH) in the USA and experience an&#xD;
      average of 2 million infections a year. It is well known that NH residents are at risk of&#xD;
      infection because of frequent hospital stays, advanced age, exposure to multiple courses of&#xD;
      antibiotics, numerous comorbidities, diminished immune response, malnutrition, and cognitive&#xD;
      impairment. The most common are pneumonia, UTIs, diarrheal illnesses, and skin and soft&#xD;
      tissue infections. Infections in NH residents have been associated with adverse clinical&#xD;
      outcomes, including high rates of morbidity and mortality, re-hospitalization, prolonged&#xD;
      hospital stays and substantial healthcare expenses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The identification of fever is a key component in the detection of infections. Studies have&#xD;
      shown that standard definition for fever, 100.5 degrees F, is not sensitive to identify&#xD;
      infections in elderly populations. The recommendation therefore is a fever of 99 degrees F or&#xD;
      an increase of 2.4 degrees F from baseline. These changes in temperatures are also a&#xD;
      significant indication that infection is present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of episodic temperatures in nursing home residents is challenging. The&#xD;
      collection of baseline measurements for all residents is logistically unachievable. The&#xD;
      continuous measurement of body temperature in any mobile population would be nearly&#xD;
      impossible by any clinically standard means.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the advent of microelectronics, long battery life, and wireless transmission, it is now&#xD;
      possible to continuously measure, record and report body temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      What remains unknown is the feasibility and clinical utility of obtaining these measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore it is proposed that for a period of three months, residents of a single, long-term&#xD;
      care facility have a wearable, thermometer applied to their skin. The medical-grade adhesive&#xD;
      and thermometer will be changed every 2-3 days. The thermometer will provide continuous&#xD;
      temperature measurement that will be sent wirelessly via Bluetooth to access points&#xD;
      positioned throughout the facility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The temperatures are reported wirelessly every minute and stored in a secure server. All&#xD;
      participants and care providers are blinded to the temperature readings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the monitoring period, the temperature readings will be compared to the&#xD;
      longitudinal healthcare record for each of the participants. Particular attention will be&#xD;
      toward hospitalizations, antibiotics, nursing records, and clinic visits to determine&#xD;
      episodes of infectious illness.&#xD;
