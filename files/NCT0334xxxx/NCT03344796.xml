  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to prevent ultraviolet light (UV) overexposure by providing consumers with&#xD;
      relevant, easy-to-access, specifically actionable information. This research proposal will&#xD;
      develop a UV protection system consisting of an automated real-time counseling framework and&#xD;
      a personal dosimeter that overcomes barriers to consumer adoption. These new, wearable&#xD;
      sensors take the form of small (&lt; 1 cm), thin (&lt;0.1 mm), lightweight (&lt;0.1 g), battery-free&#xD;
      &quot;stickers&quot; that are fundamentally differentiated from other wearable electronics in their&#xD;
      modes of use, cost structures and accuracy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed work is to refine and validate a UV protection system based on a dosimeter&#xD;
      &quot;sticker.&quot; The key innovations of the system are automated personalized intervention&#xD;
      messaging triggered by the exposure levels measured by a novel charge accumulation device&#xD;
      applied to ultraminiaturized circuit forms. The research will validate the system's accuracy&#xD;
      and acceptability to users, refine the device, and prove its robustness and efficacy in real&#xD;
      world use cases. Focus groups and structured interviews will develop sun protection&#xD;
      strategies to be communicated by text messages to participants. Successful completion of the&#xD;
      research will yield a system to prevent excessive UV exposure and sunburn, thus reducing the&#xD;
      incidence of skin cancer by equipping large numbers of general-population consumers and&#xD;
      at-risk people to practice digitally-informed healthy sun behavior.&#xD;

    <description>Participants randomized 1:1 to structured or unstructured goal setting will complete a daily online survey of sun protection used. The goal setting activity occurs on the evening of day 10. This online sun protection survey was published by this team. [Stump TK, Aspinwall LG, Gray EL, Xu S, Maganti N, Leachman SA, Robinson JK.

    <measure>Change in daily UV Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Melanoma survivors:baseline-10 days, 11-21 days. Young adults: 28 days</time_frame>
    <description>Sensor reports of daily UV exposure for participants (melanoma survivors) randomized 1:1 to structured or unstructured goal setting were compared for 2 periods (days baseline-10 days prior to goal setting and days 11-21 days after goal setting. Participants in the structured goal setting arm maintained the reduction in daily UV exposure.&#xD;
The study among young adults had three consecutive periods. The intervention intensity increased as follows: a) real-time UVB dose, b) UVB dose and daily behavioral facilitation text messages, and c) UVB dose, goal setting, and daily text messages to support self-efficacy and self-regulation. The daily UVB dose decreased during the three periods; however, the change was not statistically significant. Among young adults, aged 18-39 years, sunburns were experienced during the study by fewer subjects (n=18) than in the 28 days preceding the study (n=30).</description>

Focus group: It is expected that each participant will provide comments during the 2 hours of the focus group. It will take about one month to enroll the subjects. The audio files should be transcribed and the analysis completed in 60 days. The analysis will determine enablers and barriers to sun protected outdoor activities and determine strategies for achieving sun protected outdoor activities.</description>

Usability test with structured interview: Each participant will use the sensor for 14 days and transmit data with the app installed on their mobile phone. It will take about one month to enroll the subjects. The analysis of the structured interview is completed in one week.</description>

    <description>60 subjects&#xD;
First cohort study: It is expected that each of 60 melanoma survivors will wear the sensor and transmit data for 21 days in the warm weather months of June-Aug 2019. It will take about 2 months to enroll the subjects. Subjects will receive daily text messages in a sequence starting with behavioral facilitation, outcome expectancies, self-efficacy, and self-regulation. On day 10, participants will receive a text message prompting review and reflection on the prior 10 days of UV exposure. Participants will be randomized to receive a survey item inviting selection of strategies to achieve sun-protected outdoor activities (structured goal attainment) or submit a free text description of their strategy (unstructured goal attainment).</description>

    <description>50 young adults, ages 18-39 will participate in structured interviews to determine their barriers and enablers of sun exposure and sun protection. Eligible subjects will have at least one hour a day outdoors with 30 minutes of the hour being consecutive. It will take about 3 months to enroll the subjects. The audio files will be transcribed and analysis completed in 60 days.</description>
