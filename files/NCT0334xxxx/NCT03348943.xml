  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cerebral Palsy (CP) is a group of permanent disorders that affect movement and posture due to&#xD;
      a non-progressive lesion in the immature brain occurring in fetal brain development or in&#xD;
      infancy. These disorders are often associated with changes in sensation, learning, body&#xD;
      perception, communication and behavior. People with CP present variable difficulties in&#xD;
      muscle action. With increasing access to computer-aided accessibility, rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs have increasingly used virtual reality (VR) environments to provide functional&#xD;
      tasks. Virtual reality research in individuals with cerebral palsy has demonstrated&#xD;
      improvements in gross motor functions and functional disabilities in mobility, and is a good&#xD;
      device for rehabilitation. The present research is a cross-sectional study. For this study 40&#xD;
      individuals aged over six years (with task comprehension) of both gender who have a clinical&#xD;
      diagnosis of spastic hemiparetic Cerebral Palsy will be evaluated. Thus, the present study&#xD;
      aims to compare the motor function of the committed and uncommitted body side by performing&#xD;
      tasks in virtual reality.&#xD;

      METHOD The present research is a cross-sectional study. The study will be carried out at the&#xD;
      School of Special Education Don Bosco, Rio Branco, Acre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS (CASE) For this study 40 individuals aged over six years (with task&#xD;
      comprehension) of both gender who have a clinical diagnosis of spastic hemiparetic Cerebral&#xD;
      Palsy will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN The individuals selected will be divided according to the affected body side,&#xD;
      forming a first group categorized by RH (Right Hemiparetic) and a second LH (Left&#xD;
      Hemiparetic), and for the accomplishment of the activity in the RH group half will start the&#xD;
      task with the affected side and than with the unaffected side and the same will be reproduced&#xD;
      in the LH group. Before performing the matching Timing task, individuals will perform a&#xD;
      simple reaction time (RT) task, with 14 repetitions in each task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next, they will perform 20 attempts of the Timing task in the acquisition phase (0.5 second&#xD;
      speed between the firings of each sphere - level 4), after 10 minutes without contact with&#xD;
      the task the subjects will carry out 5 attempts for the Retention phase at the same speed as&#xD;
      the acquisition phase. Then the subjects will perform 5 more attempts for the transfer phase&#xD;
      with change in the speed of the task (0.25 seconds between the firings of each sphere - level&#xD;
      5). After the task is finished, the TR will be applied again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INSTRUMENTS Timing Software Coincident For the data collection will be used a software of&#xD;
      games created in partnership with the group of Information Systems of the School of Arts,&#xD;
      Sciences and Humanities, EACH-USP. The game proposes a Coincident Timing task, which displays&#xD;
      on the computer screen 10 spheres that light up (red light) in sequence until reaching the&#xD;
      last ball that is considered the target (Green light). The participant can have immediate&#xD;
      feedback of correctness or error of the task through different sounds (Auditory Interaction)&#xD;
      and through visual images (Visual Interaction) that change color previously demonstrated to&#xD;
      them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Software TRT_S (Simple Reaction Time) Other software used was TRT_S2012. Which was&#xD;
      constructed and validated by Crocetta et al. The software proposes a simple TRT test&#xD;
      consisting of the appearance of a yellow square (parameterizable) in the center of the&#xD;
      monitor at predefined time intervals (ranging from 1.5 to 6.5 ms - these intervals were&#xD;
      identical in both Software) and, when the stimulus is applied, the participant should react&#xD;
      as quickly as possible by pressing the spacebar on the computer keyboard.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure and design Participants will perform the task individually in a quiet room, with&#xD;
      only the experimenter, who will provide the instructions. The computer monitor will be&#xD;
      positioned on a desk. Participants will remain seated in the chair with height adjusted&#xD;
      according to the needs of each. In addition, a footrest will be available if needed. The&#xD;
      functional assessment scales will be performed at the beginning of the research, the&#xD;
      experimenter will explain the task verbally and perform a demonstration of the game's&#xD;
      functioning and interfaces (Kinect for WindowsÂ®, touch the computer key or touchscreen).&#xD;
