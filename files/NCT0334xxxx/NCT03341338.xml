  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia continues to be one of the most common health problems affecting children and&#xD;
      pregnant women in low-income countries. Nutritional iron deficiency is believed to be the&#xD;
      main driver of anaemia, so mass iron supplementation and food fortification programs have&#xD;
      been recommended by most public health organizations. However, these interventions are&#xD;
      frequently ineffective and new strategies are desperately needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both anaemia and iron absorption are influenced by multiple factors, including nutritional&#xD;
      status, infection, low grade inflammation and host genetics. The discovery of hepcidin, the&#xD;
      master regulator of iron absorption and regulation has opened new avenues for investigation.&#xD;
      Genome-wide association studies have identified several single nucleotide polymorphisms&#xD;
      (SNPs) within hepcidin regulatory genes that are associated with altered iron status both in&#xD;
      African populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to investigate the impact of genetic alterations in hepcidin regulation on&#xD;
      oral iron absorption. A recall-by-genotype study will be conducted using an existing database&#xD;
      of pre-genotype individuals in rural Gambia (West Kiang). This database comprise of data on&#xD;
      &gt;3000 Gambians, with Illumina HumanExome array data on 80K directly genotyped putative&#xD;
      functional variants as well as imputation data on 20M variants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anaemia is a recalcitrant problem in global health, affecting particularly children and&#xD;
      childbearing women in sub-Saharan Africa. Anaemia causes impaired growth and cognitive&#xD;
      development in children, poor pregnancy outcomes including both maternal and perinatal&#xD;
      mortality. Also, it is associated with poor economic growth due to its impact on physical&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mass iron supplementation and food fortification are commonly used to combat anaemia in low-&#xD;
      and middle-income countries. This due to the fact that the main driver of anaemia is thought&#xD;
      to be nutritional iron deficiency. However, these programs have had little impact in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa and new strategies are desperately needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low-cost oral iron tablets and micronutrient powders are routinely given to treat and prevent&#xD;
      anaemia in both children and pregnant women. However, often these interventions are&#xD;
      frequently ineffective, never very effective, and may even cause harm by increasing&#xD;
      susceptibility to infections. Both the aetiology of anaemia and the efficacy of iron&#xD;
      absorption are complex processes influenced by multiple factors, including nutritional&#xD;
      status, infection and host genetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepcidin, a 25-amino acid liver-produced hormone is the master regulator of body iron status.&#xD;
      Hepcidin controls plasma iron influx through its interaction with ferroportin - the only&#xD;
      known cellular iron channel. Hepcidin's binding to ferroportin leads to the degradation and&#xD;
      internalisation of the latter, thereby blocking iron traffic from macrophages, hepatocytes&#xD;
      and duodenal enterocytes, into the plasma. Hepcidin secretion is dampened by hypoxia,&#xD;
      erythroid drive and iron deficiency, to enable iron absorption, whereas, iron&#xD;
      sufficiency/overload and infection enhances hepcidin transcription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepcidin transcription is regulated by a number of signals and pathways. At the molecular&#xD;
      level, the regulation of hepcidin expression is complex, but one of the key regulators is&#xD;
      TMPRSS6 (transmembrane protease serine 6). TMPRSS6 (also called matriptase-2) is a type II&#xD;
      transmembrane serine protease principally expressed in the liver. TMPRSS6 indirectly&#xD;
      regulates hepcidin transcription, by interfering with the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP),&#xD;
      hemojuvelin (HJV), and son of mothers against decapentaplegic homolog (SMAD) signalling&#xD;
      pathway. TMPRSS6 decreases hepcidin transcription by cleaving hemojuvelin (HJV), thus,&#xD;
      reducing BMP-SMAD signalling. Cleavage of membrane-bound HJV, the BMP receptor, by TMPRSS6&#xD;
      leads to BMP reduction, thereby decreasing BMP, resulting in hepcidin repression as BMP-HJV&#xD;
      signalling is required for hepcidin transcription. TMPRSS6 is the main negative regulator of&#xD;
      hepcidin expression and functional variants leas to iron-refractory iron deficiency anaemia&#xD;
      (IRIDA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to its central role in iron homeostasis, most inherited iron pathologies arise from&#xD;
      genetic defects in genes encoding proteins that regulate hepcidin or in the hepcidin gene&#xD;
      (HAMP) itself. Genetic variations that inactivate HAMP expression result in hepcidin&#xD;
      deficiency, which has been implicated inherited iron-loading diseases such as hereditary&#xD;
      hemochromatosis (HH). In contrast, genetic alteration that lead to elevated ristrictis iron&#xD;
      availability. For instance, genetic defects that curtail the expression of TMPRSS6 results in&#xD;
      elevated hepcidin, thereby causing anaemia that is resistant to oral iron supplementation,&#xD;
      IRIDA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project aims to investigate the impact of functional single nucleotide polymorphisms&#xD;
      (SNPs) in the genes within the hepcidin regulatory pathways that are known or proposed to&#xD;
      predispose to low iron status. To begin with, the focus will be on three common SNPs within&#xD;
      the TMPRSS6 gene, rs855791, rs4820268 and rs2235321, with minor allele frequencies (MAF) at&#xD;
      7, 27 and 44% in the study population. These SNPs were selected with reference to previous&#xD;
      association and genome-wide association (GWA) studies. All three SNPs have been significantly&#xD;
      associated with fall in plasma iron status biomarkers, including serum iron, haemoglobin&#xD;
      concentrations, transferrin saturation, and a rise in hepcidin levels, as well as iron&#xD;
      deficiency anaemia in both association and GWA studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that risk alleles will cause a baseline increase in serum hepcidin levels&#xD;
      and that individuals with these SNPs will absorb iron less effectively than those with the&#xD;
      wild-type alleles. Subsequently, more functional or putative functional SNPs within the&#xD;
      TMPRSS6 gene and other hepcidin/iron-related genes such as TF, SLC11A2, TFR2 will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several GWAS have to identified dozens of SNPs association associated with low iron status.&#xD;
      Although these studies can detect phenotype-genotype associations, they fail to reveal&#xD;
      functional and mechanism underlying genotype-phenotyoe relationships. For instance, this&#xD;
      approach may be misleading due influence of variations in interim phenotypes, especially in&#xD;
      relation to genetic predictors of infections. Thus, in order to overcome this limitation, the&#xD;
      investigators will employ a recall-by-genotype paradigm the investigators termed&#xD;
      'Genes-in-Action' (GiA) to understand genotype-phenotype relationships and identify causal&#xD;
      relationships. The GiA study design will use pre-determine genetic variants of interest to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of genotype on phenotypic outcomes (genotype-biomarker-phenotype).&#xD;
      Furthermore, the GiA study design will require a large and traceable pre-genotype population.&#xD;
      Participant selection using pre-determined genetic variants improves statistical power by&#xD;
      eliminating recruitment of non-informative participants, thus providing major ethical&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The existing resource of the MRC-Gambia Keneba Biobank will be used as the basis for study&#xD;
      participant selection. This resource allows individuals from rural Gambia to be recalled from&#xD;
      an area, where a recent survey reported that anaemia affects 60% and 73% of child-bearing&#xD;
      women and children respectively. Participants will be selected from a database comprising of&#xD;
      data on &gt;3000 Gambians, with Illumina HumanExome array data on 80K directly genotyped&#xD;
      putative functional variants as well as imputation data on 20M variants.&#xD;
