      The primary objective in this study is to establish a list of host cellular proteins that&#xD;
      mediate norovirus infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Norovirus is one of the most common pathogens attributed to diarrheal diseases from unsafe&#xD;
      food. It is also the primary cause of mortality among young children and adults in foodborne&#xD;
      infections. Norovirus is not just a foodborne burden. In a recent meta-analysis, norovirus&#xD;
      accounts for nearly one-fifth of all causes of (including person-to-person transmission)&#xD;
      acute gastroenteritis in both sporadic and outbreak settings and affects all age groups.&#xD;
      Undoubtedly, norovirus is of paramount public health concern in both developed and developing&#xD;
      countries. Research efforts to better understand norovirus pathobiology will be necessary for&#xD;
      targeted intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus to Zika virus, efforts to identify host&#xD;
      factors important for mediating virus infection has always been a research priority. Such&#xD;
      information will shed light on potential therapeutic targets in antiviral intervention.&#xD;
      Norovirus virus-host interaction studies have been hampered by the lack of a robust cell&#xD;
      culture model in the past 20 years. In 2016, norovirus has finally been successfully&#xD;
      cultivated in a stem cell-derived three-dimensional human gut-like structure called enteroid&#xD;
      or mini-gut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, intestinal stem cells will be isolated from duodenal biopsies collected from&#xD;
      participants, followed by differentiation into mini-guts. Genome-wide genetic screening for&#xD;
      host essential and restrictive factors will be performed on infected mini-guts by knockout&#xD;
      CRISPR and gain-of-function CRISPR SAM, respectively. Shortlisted candidates will undergo&#xD;
      preliminary functional validation in cell lines. These data will provide insights into&#xD;
      potential therapeutic targets against norovirus infection.&#xD;

      Study design and overview - This is a laboratory-based study. The investigators plan to&#xD;
      establish a list of host cellular proteins regulating norovirus infection. Methods will&#xD;
      include establishment of patient-specific stem cell-derived human intestinal enteroids as an&#xD;
      infection model and genome-wide CRISPR and CRISPR SAM genetic screens upon infections of two&#xD;
      norovirus genotypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ***Establishment of human intestinal enteroid model***&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Duodenal biopsies and saliva collection - After obtaining IRB-approved informed consent,&#xD;
           two duodenal biopsy samples will be obtained from each participant undergoing upper&#xD;
           gastrointestinal endoscopy without contraindications for biopsy sampling, such as&#xD;
           participants on anti-coagulation or with other causes of bleeding diathesis. Biopsy&#xD;
           samples will be immersed in ice-cold 1xPBS and transported immediately to the laboratory&#xD;
           within 30 minutes for further processing. In addition, saliva (1-2 mL) will be collected&#xD;
           from each participant for secretor status testing by ELISA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Isolation of crypt stem cells and differentiation - Upon arrival, biopsy samples will&#xD;
           first be chopped into smaller pieces. Intestinal crypt cells will be isolated by&#xD;
           repeated washing and incubation with 1x Complete Chelating solution (1xCCS) and EDTA&#xD;
           buffer. Supernatant containing crypt cells will then be grown in Matrigel containing&#xD;
           complete medium with growth factors (CMGF+) (Wnt 3 and Rspo-1 conditioned media, Noggin,&#xD;
           A83, B27, EGF, N2, n-acetylcysteine, gastrin, nicotinamide, and SB202190). Budding&#xD;
           crypts will then be incubated in differentiation medium (CMGF+, excluding Wnt 3&#xD;
           conditioned medium, SB202190 and nicotinamide as well as having reduced amount of Rspo-1&#xD;
           conditioned medium and Noggin). Formation of three-dimensional gut-like enteroids will&#xD;
           be monitored daily.&#xD;
