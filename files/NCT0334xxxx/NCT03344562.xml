      This will be a double blinded randomized clinical trial carried out at Zale-Lipshy and&#xD;
      Parkland Hospital Inpatient Rehabilitation Facilities. Acute stroke patients with insomnia,&#xD;
      identified by the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and who choose to participate in this study&#xD;
      will be randomized to CES (Cranial Electrical Stimulation) or sham CES. Patients who do not&#xD;
      feel they are getting adequate sleep but want to continue in the study will be given the&#xD;
      option to receive the standard of care medication as a rescue starting on the 3rd night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive treatment with a Fisher-Wallace CES device or Sham CES. Treatment with&#xD;
      CES will be for 20 minutes once a day, and the treatment period will be for 7 days. Patients&#xD;
      will be allowed to increase the intensity of the device from the suggested starting point of&#xD;
      level 2 if they feel no improvement in sleep on night 1. Groups will be monitored with a&#xD;
      wrist worn actigraph that records the patient's activity for the duration of the period of&#xD;
      study and provides data on sleep latency, time spent asleep, and sleep efficiency. The&#xD;
      outcome measures will be total minutes/hours of sleep, sleep efficiency and subjective&#xD;
      reports of drowsiness using the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale. Actigraphic data will be&#xD;
      collected 24 hours a day for 7 days. The total length of study will be about 24 months with a&#xD;
      target N of 100 consented individuals and 85 participants. Patients will be allowed to exit&#xD;
      the study at any time on their own choosing. To minimize loss of subjects, patients will have&#xD;
      the option to choose SOC rescue starting on the third night. Patients who choose the SOC&#xD;
      rescue will continue to be monitored with an actigraph for data collection purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should discontinue study participation for a given subject or withdraw the&#xD;
      subject from study if he/she believes that continuation would be detrimental to the subject's&#xD;
      well-being. A subject can decide to withdraw from the study at any time and for any reason.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if CES is a reasonable first line alternative to&#xD;
      the current standard of care (SOC) which relies on the use of trazodone for patients with&#xD;
      subacute stroke. This objective will be answered by addressing the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Specific Aim 1: To determine if stroke patients with insomnia who receive CES treatment&#xD;
      sleep more hours than stroke patients treated with sham CES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Stroke patients with insomnia who are treated with CES will accumulate more&#xD;
      sleeping hours than patients who are treated with sham CES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Specific Aim 2: To determine if stroke patients with insomnia who receive CES treatment&#xD;
      have better sleep efficiency than stroke patients treated with sham CES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Stroke patients with insomnia who are treated with CES will demonstrate&#xD;
      significantly better sleep efficiency than stroke patients treated with shame CES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will take place at Zale Lipshy Hospital in Dallas, Texas. The study will enroll 85&#xD;
      stroke patients who score 7 or higher on the Insomnia Severity Scale. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to a control group or CES treatment group. Patients will receive CES or sham CES&#xD;
      for 7 days after a 24-hour washout period. Objective and subjective sleep assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted daily during the 7-day study period. Endpoints will be total time spent sleeping,&#xD;
      sleep efficiency and daytime drowsiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The known risks of CES are minimal and mild in nature. They include potential for headache,&#xD;
      irritation at the site of electrode placement and dizziness. These adverse reactions are rare&#xD;
      and in most cases there are no immediate or delayed side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial is designed to meet two study objectives related to quality&#xD;
      of sleep and daytime drowsiness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data will be collected from the hospital record and will include age, gender,&#xD;
      type of stroke, self-reported history of insomnia or other sleep disorder, prior use of sleep&#xD;
      medications, in-hospital use of sleep medications, co-morbid medical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients admitted to inpatient rehabilitation (IPR) who consent to the study will undergo an&#xD;
      overnight washout period before initiation of CES or sham treatment. This allows for any&#xD;
      sleep medication they might have received while in acute care to be metabolized and leave&#xD;
      their system. On their admission day, day 0 (d0) patients will be asked if they want to&#xD;
      participate in our study. If they choose to participate and meet medical inclusion criteria,&#xD;
      they will be tested with ISI. Patients who meet the full criteria will not receive sleep&#xD;
      medication or CES on their first night.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin on day 1 (d1) with the patient receiving 20 minutes of CES/sCES in the&#xD;
      morning. This time will be distraction free without the entrance of laboratory technicians,&#xD;
      nurses, housekeeping or other staff members. When this period is complete, they will&#xD;
      participate in usual care. At midday they will be asked to complete the Karolinska Sleepiness&#xD;
      Scale (KSS). The patient will wear the actigraph throughout the study. This procedure will be&#xD;
      repeated for 7 treatment days. All procedures will be carried out by research team members or&#xD;
      a trained nurse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensity of the CES will begin on setting 2, standard setting recommended by the device&#xD;
      manufacturer, and the patient will have the option to increase the intensity to setting 3 on&#xD;
      the second treatment day if they feel they did not receive any benefit from the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient does not feel they are getting adequate sleep the patient may choose to opt&#xD;
      out of CES/sCES treatment and receive the standard of care medication for the remainder of&#xD;
      the study. Patients who choose the SOC rescue will continue to be monitored with the&#xD;
      actigraph. A patient may choose to leave the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on side effects for the CES treatment will be collected during the 7 days of the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods of assigning patients to treatment groups and blinding Patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      the active or sham treatment group using an online randomizer, Research randomizer&#xD;
      (www.randomizer.org). A list of random numbers will be generated prior to the study. Patients&#xD;
      will be assigned a random number in the order that the generator produces. All even patients&#xD;
      will be assigned to the control group; odd numbered patients will be assigned to the&#xD;
      treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural responsibilities and oversight Nursing staff will be educated how to administer&#xD;
      the CES and asked to help distribute and collect the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale&#xD;
      questionnaire. Photos of proper placement and instructions will be posted in subjects' rooms&#xD;
      for reference. Researchers affiliated with this project will apply and remove the actigraph&#xD;
      watches and be responsible for data acquisition, cleaning and charging of the devices.&#xD;
      Researchers affiliated with the study will be responsible for ensuring CES is delivered to&#xD;
      the appropriate patients on the days required per protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verbal recruitment process will be used for the study. The attending and resident physicians&#xD;
      will be educated about the study and asked to identity patients who may be appropriate. A&#xD;
      member of the research team will explain the risks, benefits and rationale for the study to&#xD;
      patients who meet inclusion criteria. Patients will be enrolled when they arrive on the&#xD;
      rehabilitation floor if they choose to participate. Consent will be attained via a written&#xD;
      document in the subject's primary language (English or Spanish).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team will protect subjects' privacy by conducting all study related verbal&#xD;
      interactions with the subject in a closed room, such as the patient's room. For&#xD;
      confidentiality, each subject screened will be assigned a unique identification number (ID#).&#xD;
      Subjects will only be identified by the unique ID # in the data. No demographic data or&#xD;
      personal information will be used to identify subjects. This unique ID# will be linked to&#xD;
      subject name and will be kept in a locked file cabinet, accessible only to the research team.&#xD;
      Only the research team will have access to the data. All data for presentations and&#xD;
      publications will be reported as mean ± standard error of means. Investigators will educate&#xD;
      faculty and residents on each floor about the study to maintain privacy and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was calculated based on several studies that measured the number of hours that&#xD;
      subacute rehabilitation patients sleep in an inpatient hospital setting. Alpha levels for&#xD;
      error probability were set at .05 for a two-tailed test with 80% power to detect a difference&#xD;
      between means of control group compared to CES treatment group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to determine differences between CES and sCES treatment&#xD;
      groups. A T-test will be used to determine if sleep time means differ between groups (p≤&#xD;
      .05). A chi square analysis will be used to compare data collected from the Karolinska&#xD;
      Sleepiness Scale. A non-parametric test will be used if data is not able to demonstrate&#xD;
      normal distribution.&#xD;
