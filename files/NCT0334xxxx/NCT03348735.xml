    <textblock>
      Evaluation of topical treatment with lidocaine 5% patch (daily administration) or capsaicin&#xD;
      8% patch (periodic administration - upon reoccurrence of pain symptoms) in adult patients&#xD;
      suffering from localized neuropathic pain (LNP) across a wide variety of etiologies, with a&#xD;
      duration between 1 and 24 months (subacute to chronic neuropathic pain (NP)).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A multicentre, randomized, open-label comparative trial evaluating topical treatment options&#xD;
      versus oral systemic treatment in adult patients suffering from localized neuropathic pain&#xD;
      (LNP) syndromes. A wide variety of peripheral neuropathic pain syndromes will be included&#xD;
      such as post-herpetic neuralgia (PHN), post-surgical NP/post-traumatic NP/scar pain,&#xD;
      post-amputation NP, post-radiation therapy NP, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) type 1.&#xD;
      In contrast to most (or even all) commercial clinical studies we will not limit the inclusion&#xD;
      to one or two distinct neuropathic pain syndromes such as post-herpetic neuralgia (inclusion&#xD;
      based on etiology of the neuropathic syndrome). In this pragmatic trial we will however&#xD;
      include all patients suffering from a clinical neuropathic syndrome with distinct clinical&#xD;
      features such as hyperalgesia/allodynia, presence of spontaneous positive sensory phenomena&#xD;
      and lasting for more than 3 months without making any exclusion based on etiology. Initial&#xD;
      pain intensity indicates the presence of either moderate or severe pain in these adult&#xD;
      patients (NRS 4/10).&#xD;

    <description>Oral treatment with pregabalin (75mg capsules) will be used at optimized doses to best match clinical practice in Europe. In European clinical practice, up-titration of the dose is often carried out over a longer time-period. This study thus includes up-titration schedule for pregabalin over a period of 4 weeks. If patients develop side-effects during the intake/uptitration of pregabalin this treatment can be stopped and switched to gabapentin (300mg capsules). Gabapentin will always be the back-up treatment for failed systematic treatment with pregabalin. Dose of gabapentin will be uptitrated to maximum 1200mg per day.</description>
