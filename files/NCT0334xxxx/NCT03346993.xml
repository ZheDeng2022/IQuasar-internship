  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brachial plexus blocks have some advantages, but also have some disadvantages as well. As&#xD;
      with all nerve blocks, having to wait sometime for an effective block, sometimes failure to&#xD;
      achieve an adequate block and possible requirement for isolated nerve block, having to wait a&#xD;
      long time for resolution of the block, and immobilization of the extremity for some time can&#xD;
      be seen as handicaps for brachial plexus block as well. In the present study, Study was aimed&#xD;
      to compare the effects of bupivacaine warmed to body temperature and kept at room temperature&#xD;
      on the onset time of ultrasound guided infraclavicular brachial plexus block.&#xD;

      The study design was approved by the locale ethics committee. This double-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized, controlled clinical trial recruited 60 patients aged between 18 and 65 years with&#xD;
      the American society of anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status classification systems I/II&#xD;
      and III who were candidated for surgical operations on any of the forearm, wrist and hand&#xD;
      regions. All the participants were asked to sign an informed consent form after having been&#xD;
      provided with details of the aim and proceedings of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were excluded from the study if they had a neurological and neuromuscular disorders,&#xD;
      psychiatric problems, cardiopulmonary diseases, coagulopathy, infections or allergy to local&#xD;
      anesthetic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were equally and randomly distributed into a 24C° 20 ml 0,5% bupivacaine group&#xD;
      (Group 1), and 37C° 20 ml 0,5% bupivacaine group (Group 2) via closed envelope technique. All&#xD;
      the participants were premedicated with 0.05 mg/kg of intravenous midazolam and monitored&#xD;
      routinely before attempting nerve block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine stored for at least 2 hours in a bain-marie (Memmert Waterbath WNB7, Germany) at&#xD;
      38˚C (regular temperature calibration was made) for Group 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The block process was accomplished by an anesthesiologist, who was blind to the temperature&#xD;
      of bupivacaine and local anesthetic agent was administered by different anesthesiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the ICBP block, an anesthetist blinded to the technique evaluated sensory and&#xD;
      motor block in every minutes between 5th and 30th minutes as follows. The innervated areas&#xD;
      (each dermatome) was evaluated using a pinprick test. The motor block was evaluated by&#xD;
      bromage modified scale in every minutes between 10th and 30th minutes. Anxious patients were&#xD;
      administered additional midazolam. Subjects refusing awake surgery were administered a&#xD;
      propofol infusion with supplemental oxygen as necessary.&#xD;
