  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Head and neck oncologic surgery often requires the use of free tissue transfer, or&#xD;
      microvascular reconstruction, to reconstruct defects created by tumor resections. Although&#xD;
      there are several techniques for the reconstruction of defects, resection of large tumors&#xD;
      leave defects that require the transfer of vascularized tissue from one part of the body to&#xD;
      repair the defect. For example, the removal of a segment of diseased mandible requires free&#xD;
      tissue transfer containing the component parts - skin, muscle, and bone - to reconstruct the&#xD;
      deficit created by the resection of the tumor. Over the years, microvascular surgeons have&#xD;
      focused their attention on maximizing the success of these technically difficult surgeries.&#xD;
      However, now, with free flap reconstruction rates in excess of 95%, surgeons are afforded the&#xD;
      opportunity to turn their focus toward the morbidities associated with these surgeries. While&#xD;
      much has been published about donor site wound healing, pain control in the post-operative&#xD;
      period has largely been neglected in the head and neck reconstruction literature. Systemic&#xD;
      analgesia with opioids is standard of care, which has been shown to lead to increased&#xD;
      confusion, significantly increased length of stay and increased risk of pulmonary&#xD;
      complications. In addition, it has been shown that early mobilization and optimal wound care&#xD;
      can decrease donor site morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the clinical team aims to better control donor site pain utilizing local,&#xD;
      targeted analgesia to relieve pain at the donor site for osseocutaneous free-flaps. To reduce&#xD;
      confounding and bias, the study will be a double-blind prospective randomized placebo&#xD;
      controlled trial wherein patients undergoing osseocutaneous free flap surgery will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive continuous infusion of ropivacaine or normal saline (placebo) via local&#xD;
      continuous infusion catheter, which will be placed intraoperatively at the time of donor site&#xD;
      closure. Patients' pain will be monitored for the first 48hrs after surgery. Donor site and&#xD;
      global pain at rest will be evaluated every 8 hours for the first two postoperative days&#xD;
      using a visual analogue pain scale (VAS). Essentially, there is a 100 millimeter line drawn&#xD;
      on a piece of paper, with &quot;no pain&quot; marking the left end of the line and &quot;worst pain&quot; marking&#xD;
      the right end of the line. Subjects mark with a pen along the line where pain is felt fits&#xD;
      along that continuum. A researcher then measures how far along the line that mark is placed&#xD;
      and then it is recorded. Median daily opiate use via PCA will also be tracked. Donor&#xD;
      site-specific range of motion and strength will be assessed with a formal physical therapy&#xD;
      evaluation on post-operative day 2 or soonest non-holiday weekday. Information on patient&#xD;
      satisfaction, time to ambulation, and length of stay will also be collected. Subgroup&#xD;
      analysis will be performed.&#xD;

      Procedures involved in this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Intraoperatively, following procurement of the fibula or scapula bone graft and at the time&#xD;
      of surgical wound closure, all patients will receive the placement of a continuous infusion&#xD;
      catheter into the donor site wound bed. The infusion reservoir will be connected to a&#xD;
      catheter-based On-Q pump, and the catheter will be placed in the donor site. A stab incision&#xD;
      separate from the surgical wound will be used to bring the catheter through the skin.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized to receive 6 ml/hr of 0.2% Ropivacaine or 6 ml/hr of normal&#xD;
      saline via the infusion reservoir. The catheter will be left in place with continuous&#xD;
      infusion for first 48 hours of the post-operative period. The catheters will be removed by&#xD;
      the housestaff on POD2. There is minimal risk to removing the OnQ catheter. Any opening in&#xD;
      the skin will be covered with gauze to allow primary healing. Solutions of saline and&#xD;
      ropivacaine will be prepared and made available for infusion by the Mount Sinai Pharmacy.&#xD;
      Solutions will be blinded, and identical in appearance. Patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      ropivacaine or saline intervention by the research pharmacy through coded envelopes.&#xD;
      Patients, physicians, nurses, and research personnel will be blinded to treatment assignment.&#xD;
      Every 8 hours for the first 48 hours, patients will be asked to complete a visual analogue&#xD;
      scale (VAS) for reporting their pain. The VAS will be performed six times over the course of&#xD;
      the 48hrs. These will be performed during regular flap check monitoring, to ensure patients&#xD;
      are not disrupted additional times throughout the day for this study. Patients will otherwise&#xD;
      receive standard of care pain management, including Tylenol 650 q6hr standing as well as a&#xD;
      dilaudid PCA set to low-dose, opioid naïve. On post-operative day 2 patient will receive a&#xD;
      physical therapy evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to discharge from the hospital, the study subjects will be asked to complete a brief&#xD;
      survey (APS-POQ-R Pain Survey) regarding their experience, with regard to pain management.&#xD;

        <title>Post-Operative Pain at Donor-Site</title>
        <description>Pain assessed every 8 hours for the first 48 hours using a visual analogue pain scale at rest. A visual analogue pain scale is a validated pain measure. Essentially, there is a 100 millimeter line drawn on a piece of paper, with &quot;no pain&quot; marking the left end of the line and &quot;worst pain&quot; marking the right end of the line. Subjects mark with a pen along the line where pain is felt fits along that continuum. A researcher then measures how far along the line that mark is placed and then it is recorded. Full scale from 0-100, higher score indicates more pain.</description>
