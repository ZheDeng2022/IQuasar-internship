  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aortic disease is a kind of cardiovascular diseases with very high mortality rate and high&#xD;
      risk of surgical treatment. At present, the surgical and endovascular treatment for diseases&#xD;
      in the ascending aorta, descending aorta and abdominal aorta are becoming more and more&#xD;
      mature. However, due to the complexity of the aortic arch in anatomy, function and&#xD;
      pathological changes, the optimal treatment strategy for diseases in the aortic arch has been&#xD;
      controversial constantly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is a multi-center(four centers), prospective, controlled, large-scale (about&#xD;
      400 subjects) clinical study, using traditional thoracic surgery of aortic arch disease as a&#xD;
      control to verify that new techniques for endovascular treatment is not inferior to&#xD;
      traditional thoracic surgery in terms of efficiency and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further more, the investigators plan to explore the indications of the application of these&#xD;
      new techniques, develop a better diagnosis and treatment program, reduce the risk of such&#xD;
      surgical treatment and the incidence of complications, improve clinical efficacy and the&#xD;
      overall quality of the disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The subjects in this study are patients with aortic arch disease, after scientific assessment&#xD;
      made by the team with wide experience in aortic open surgery and endovascular treatment, who&#xD;
      are able to both withstand traditional total aortic arch replacement (TAR) and are suitable&#xD;
      for complete thoracic endovascular aortic repair (cTEVAR) in terms of anatomical structure.&#xD;
      According to the requirement of statistical analysis, more than 400 patients would be&#xD;
      enrolled in the four centers (Fuwai Hospital, Peking University People's Hospital,&#xD;
      China-Japan Friendship Hospital and Beijing Hospital) within 2 years. Combined the actual&#xD;
      situation of the patients, subjects would be divided into TAR and cTEVAR groups. During the&#xD;
      study, the investigators would collect the data including blood and biochemical indexes,&#xD;
      complications, aortic CT examination, surgical procedure, and the follow-up information in&#xD;
      discharge, one month after surgery, six months after surgery and twelve months after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint of this study is one-year treatment success, which means there are no&#xD;
      death within 30 days after surgery, no adverse cardiovascular and no cerebrovascular events&#xD;
      and no re-operative intervention associated with aorta occurred during the 1-year follow-up&#xD;
      period. Secondary endpoints include the occurrence of postoperative leaks, occlusion,&#xD;
      stenosis and thrombosis of aortic arch branches, the incidence of device-related adverse&#xD;
      events, and the incidence of other serious complications. This study uses the primary&#xD;
      endpoint as a measure of efficacy, and the secondary endpoint as a measure of safety for both&#xD;
      treatment methods. The primary analysis of collected data would be based on&#xD;
      intention-to-treat (ITT) principle, and all enrolled patients would be included in the final&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel (CMH) chi square analysis for adjusting center effects will be&#xD;
      used for comparisons of major indicators, estimating differences in success rates and their&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals in two groups. If the lower limit of the 95% Confidence Interval&#xD;
      (CI) of the difference in success rate between the test group and control group exceeds the&#xD;
      pre-established non-inferiority cutoff, the endovascular treatment can be considered to be as&#xD;
      effective as traditional open surgery. The significance level for all statistical tests is&#xD;
      5%, and the statistical analysis software is Statistics Analysis System (SAS) 9.3.&#xD;
