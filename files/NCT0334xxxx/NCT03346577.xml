  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this observational study is to evaluate the performance and safety of&#xD;
      endovascular treatment with stenting (Optimed Sinus Superflex 635) or balloon angioplasty&#xD;
      (Cardionovum Legflow or Optimed Nylotrack .035 + .018) according to current practice. The&#xD;
      goal of the study will be achieved by assessing binary restenosis with duplex ultrasound,&#xD;
      peri- and postoperative complications, technical success, target lesion revascularization,&#xD;
      amputation and clinical outcome.&#xD;
