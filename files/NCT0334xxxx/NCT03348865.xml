      Research Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test the FeLiCiA, a 6 week intervention developed for the management of psychological&#xD;
           morbidities associated with infertility, using external randomised control trial&#xD;
           methods, on patients showing positive indicators for psychological morbidity amongst&#xD;
           patients with infertility at UCH Ibadan, Nigeria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To explore and understand patient perspectives on the benefits of the FeLiCiA&#xD;
           counselling in addition to usual clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size N=42 Men &amp; Women (aged 21-45) with GHQ 12 score indicative of mild to moderate&#xD;
      psychological morbidities (3 or more) among patients attending University College Hospital&#xD;
      for infertility treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants will be recruited by randomisation into a pilot trial of the&#xD;
      intervention. The pilot trial will be in two groups- the intervention group (FELICIA) and the&#xD;
      control group (No intervention/ treatment as usual). The intervention group will be see&#xD;
      undergo a 6 weekly counselling sessions, using the FELICIA manual to deliver infertility&#xD;
      counselling. The counselling sessions are to be delivered by the nurses at the infertility&#xD;
      clinic who will be trained by the researcher to deliver this intervention. The FeLiCiA manual&#xD;
      was developed by Dr Abiola Aiyenigba who is the principal investigator. FeLiCiA is based on&#xD;
      the THINKING HEALTH PROGRAMME developed by Prof Atif Rahman, who will also be supervising the&#xD;
      research. Further details are available in the FeLiCiA manual, which is attached to his&#xD;
      proposal for further reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi structure interviews: Qualitative research will be carried out using one to one&#xD;
      interviews. Patient will be asked to discuss their views regarding the benefits of the&#xD;
      intervention in helping them manage the stresses that they face dealing with infertility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried in the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria Study&#xD;
      Population The study population will consist of patients attending clinics for the treatment&#xD;
      of infertility at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, Nigeria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Method (N=42):&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the external pilot RCT for testing the FeLiCiA intervention, thirty-eight patients are&#xD;
      required to have an 80% chance of detecting, as significant at 5% level, an increase in the&#xD;
      primary outcome measure from 5% in the control group to 40% in the experimental group. We&#xD;
      increase this sample size by 10% to account for drop out during the 6 weeks, making up a&#xD;
      total of 42 patients to be recruited for the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants who have consented to participate in the research will be randomized into 2&#xD;
      groups - the Intervention group and the Control Group. The randomization is blinded and&#xD;
      allocated using sealed opaque envelopes. The envelopes have been prepared by an independent&#xD;
      person; all those carrying out the research have no idea what the contents of the envelopes&#xD;
      indicate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are eligible and wish to continue with the research will be handed a brown&#xD;
      sealed envelope, opened for the first time in the presence of the participant. Depending on&#xD;
      the content of the envelope patients will be randomized into either the intervention or&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention group will receive the FeLiCiA counselling intervention while the Control&#xD;
      group will receive treatment as usual. Counselling sessions will take place via discussion&#xD;
      once every week for six weeks. Each counselling session will last no more than 1 hour.&#xD;
      Interviews will also take place at the 2 follow up periods at the end of the sis weeks&#xD;
      counselling and six months post counselling. (See follow up procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi structure interviews:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants recruited for the qualitative study (one to one interviews) will be interviewed&#xD;
      on one occasion for one to one qualitative research. An interview sessions is expected to&#xD;
      last no more than 1 hour.&#xD;
