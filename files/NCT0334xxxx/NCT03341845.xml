  <brief_summary>

      a monocenter, open label, single arm, phase II study of the combination of axitinib with&#xD;
      avelumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with intermediate to high-risk non-metastatic&#xD;
      RCC.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) accounts for 3% of adult malignancies and constitutes 95% of renal&#xD;
      tumors. Surgical complete resection is currently the only curative treatment of RCC,&#xD;
      including patients with locally advanced RCC or limited metastatic disease. However, these&#xD;
      patients carry a high risk to develop locally recurrent disease and systemic progression.&#xD;
      High risk patients with no evidence of disease following complete resection may therefore&#xD;
      benefit from adjuvant and neo-adjuvant systemic treatment strategies which primarily aim to&#xD;
      prolong disease free (DFS) and ultimately overall survival (OS). Neoadjuvant studies are a&#xD;
      unique opportunity to further investigate the way in which immune checkpoint inhibition works&#xD;
      and to identify predictors of treatment response. Recent research on intratumoral immune&#xD;
      components after pretreatment of human renal cell carcinoma suggest a potential synergism for&#xD;
      TKI with anti-PD-L1 therapy that could be exploited. In terms of downsizing tumours by&#xD;
      pretreatment, axitinib has been shown to be more effective than sunitinib when comparing&#xD;
      trials that have been performed with each drug. However, the immunemodulatory effect of&#xD;
      axitinib has been ill defined. Since axitinib and anti-PD-L1 therapy would make for a&#xD;
      potential synergism, two phase Ib dose-finding studies to evaluate safety, pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of avelumab, an anti-PD-L1 monoclonal antibody, or pembrolizumab, an&#xD;
      anti-PD1 monoclonal antibody, in combination with axitinib were performed. First results on&#xD;
      response rate and safety profile presented at ESMO 2016 were promising with objective&#xD;
      response rates of 67-70 % and toxicity profiles as seen with VEGFR-treatment. The&#xD;
      investigator proposes a monocenter, open label, single arm, phase II study of the combination&#xD;
      of axitinib with avelumab as neoadjuvant therapy in patients with intermediate to high-risk&#xD;
      non-metastatic RCC. The statistical calculation of the primary endpoint is based on efficacy&#xD;
      on the local tumour. The safety of this combination prior to surgery will be an important&#xD;
      secondary endpoint.&#xD;
