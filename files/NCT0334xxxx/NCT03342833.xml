      The purpose of this current study proposal is to identify the potential physiological&#xD;
      adaptations arising from a combined BFR+HIIT training intervention in CHF patients. We&#xD;
      hypothesise that the addition of BFR to HIIT will increase whole-body V̇O2peak by promoting&#xD;
      vascular and skeletal muscle adaptations above that seen with HIIT alone. The secondary&#xD;
      outcomes of this study are to determine if such a training intervention leads to clinical&#xD;
      improvements in exercise intolerance symptoms and quality of life indices. Given that the&#xD;
      majority of previous research in to both BFR and HIIT has largely involved young, healthy and&#xD;
      relatively active participants, the final objective of this current proposal is to determine&#xD;
      the viability, tolerability and efficacy of these training modalities in an elderly cohort of&#xD;
      predominantly sedentary CHF patients.&#xD;

      Exercise training in CHF is a potentially effective intervention for improving symptomatic&#xD;
      and prognostic outcomes, but remains underutilised in contemporary CHF management in the&#xD;
      United Kingdom. This underutilisation may be partly the result of multiple approaches to&#xD;
      training but also due to inconsistent and overall modest results of any of the interventions&#xD;
      on important patient-orientated outcomes. A key consideration in this latter regard is&#xD;
      whether disease related symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea) during exercise training limit the&#xD;
      physiological work achievable during training, limiting the degree of the training stimulus&#xD;
      to below the level at which physiological adaptation can be achieved. For example, in COPD&#xD;
      participants only those in whom skeletal muscle fatigue was present after a training session&#xD;
      evidenced any improvement in functional exercise capacity and health-related quality of life&#xD;
      following a 3-month rehabilitation programme. Investigating novel approaches to training that&#xD;
      promote greater gains in training effect may therefore lead to greater changes in&#xD;
      patient-centred outcomes which will eventually stimulate greater uptake and alleviate the&#xD;
      clinical burden chronic heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Flow Restriction (BFR) training is a novel strategy in which a pressure cuff is&#xD;
      inflated around the proximal portion of the exercising limbs (e.g. at the top of the arms or&#xD;
      legs) during exercise or in recovery periods between exercise bouts. The pressure of the cuff&#xD;
      is set to allow arterial blood flow but occlude venous return, subsequently altering (or&#xD;
      maintaining) the local metabolic milieu, resulting in upregulation of several downstream&#xD;
      pathways that augment the adaptive response to exercise. BFR has been successfully employed&#xD;
      previously in combination with resistance exercise (RE) training to augment skeletal muscle&#xD;
      hypertrophy in isolated peripheral muscles. Importantly, this training has been shown to&#xD;
      promote muscle hypertrophy with concomitant increases in isokinetic strength in elderly&#xD;
      individuals performing at low exercise work rates. This therefore demonstrates that BFR can&#xD;
      induce comparatively similar adaptations at a lower power in elderly populations, suggesting&#xD;
      this training strategy may have applications in other groups, such as CHF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional studies have also demonstrated improvements in V̇O2peak by combining BFR with&#xD;
      traditional low-intensity endurance training or high-intensity interval training (HIIT).&#xD;
      Using a within-measures design, the first of these studies demonstrated that a 4-week&#xD;
      training intervention (4 sessions per week) of 45-mins single-leg cycling under ischaemic&#xD;
      conditions (induced by an external pressure of 50 mmHg in a pressure chamber) improved&#xD;
      time-to-fatigue and V̇O2peak significantly more than an identical training intervention on&#xD;
      the contralateral leg under normoxic (non-ischaemic) conditions. Further research with a&#xD;
      between-measures design showed that 8-weeks of low-intensity cycling (40% V̇O2peak) with&#xD;
      continuous BFR (160-210 mmHg) can increase both muscle strength and cross-sectional area as&#xD;
      well as V̇O2peak significantly more than a control intervention using the same protocol&#xD;
      without BFR. Interestingly, the control group exercised for longer during their training&#xD;
      sessions (45-mins vs 15-mins for BFR) demonstrating that BFR not only has the potential to&#xD;
      augment adaptations but is also a time-efficient modality of exercise. Given that lack of&#xD;
      time is frequently cited as a barrier to regular exercise training, novel training&#xD;
      interventions, such as BFR, that aren't time-consuming may be considered an attractive&#xD;
      alternative form of exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIIT is also promoted as a time-efficient training modality that is known to promote&#xD;
      comparable physiological adaptations to traditional high-volume low-intensity endurance&#xD;
      exercise training. HIIT typically involves repeated bouts of intense ('near-maximal')&#xD;
      exercise separated by brief periods of recovery. Some training studies have now combined BFR&#xD;
      with HIIT (BFR+HIIT), applying the pressure cuff during recovery periods rather than during&#xD;
      exercise. This combination of BFR+HIIT allows the working muscle to perform as normal during&#xD;
      the short bouts of exercise; however, application of the cuff during recovery was shown to&#xD;
      promote superior physiological adaptations above HIIT alone. Specifically, this study&#xD;
      demonstrated that 4-weeks (2 sessions per week) of sprint interval training (4-7 bouts of&#xD;
      maximal 30s cycling sprints with 4.5-mins recovery) combined with BFR (2-mins at 130 mmHg&#xD;
      during the recovery period) significantly increased V̇O2peak compared to a control group&#xD;
      performing the same training protocol without BFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the exact mechanisms responsible for this superior physiological response have yet&#xD;
      to be fully elucidated, it is likely that the combination of BFR and HIIT promotes localized&#xD;
      adaptations within the peripheral muscle tissues performing the exercise and then being&#xD;
      subjected to BFR i.e. in the case of cycling, the quadriceps muscle group. Such adaptations&#xD;
      are coordinated by the metabolic changes known to occur with both exercise and localized&#xD;
      ischaemia. These result in an increased expression of several intracellular transcription&#xD;
      factors, which subsequently orchestrate a cascade of downstream signalling pathways that&#xD;
      promote physiological adaptations within skeletal muscle. These adaptations include increased&#xD;
      capillarisation (angiogenesis), mitochondrial biogenesis, and a phenotypic switch towards&#xD;
      predominantly slow-oxidative non-fatiguing type 1 muscle fibres. There has also been the&#xD;
      suggestion that BFR can upregulate peripheral vascular adaptations. Collectively, these&#xD;
      increase muscle oxygen delivery (̇Q̇mO2) and uptake (V̇mO2), both of which are now considered&#xD;
      as crucial training-induced adaptive responses for increasing whole-body V̇O2peak and&#xD;
      ameliorating exercise intolerance symptoms in CHF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, several exercise training interventions in CHF patients have previously focused on&#xD;
      promoting adaptive responses within the vasculature and peripheral skeletal muscles as a&#xD;
      means of increasing V̇O2peak. The rationale for these studies is based on the poor&#xD;
      correlation between LV ejection fraction and exercise intolerance symptoms in CHF.&#xD;
      Furthermore, it is now well recognised that several peripheral impairments within the&#xD;
      skeletal muscle system contribute to the symptoms of exercise intolerance in CHF. These&#xD;
      include vascular dysfunction, muscle fibre atrophy, reduced capillarisation, mitochondrial&#xD;
      dysfunction, and a shift towards predominantly fast-twitch glycolytic type IIx fibres.&#xD;
      Collectively, these contribute to poor symptoms and therefore previous exercise training&#xD;
      interventions in CHF patients have focused on promoting adaptations within the periphery as a&#xD;
      means of increasing V̇O2peak and ameliorating exercise intolerance. Many of these studies&#xD;
      have successfully demonstrated an increase in V̇O2peak primarily by promoting adaptations&#xD;
      within the periphery. As such, we believe that BFR+HIIT represents a novel training stimulus&#xD;
      that may promote adaptive responses within the vascular and skeletal muscle systems that are&#xD;
      likely to have significant effects in terms of increasing V̇O2peak, ameliorating exercise&#xD;
      intolerance and improving quality of life in CHF patients.&#xD;
