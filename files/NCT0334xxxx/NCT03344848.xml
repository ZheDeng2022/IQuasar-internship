    <textblock>
      This is an early feasibility study of a new device, the Orion Visual Cortical Prosthesis&#xD;
      System. The device is intended to stimulate the surface of the visual cortex to induce visual&#xD;
      perception in blind individuals.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, 6 subjects with bare light or no light perception in both eyes will be&#xD;
      implanted with the Orion Cortical Visual Prosthesis System. The study will evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of the device and surgery, as well as reliability of the system and the usefulness of&#xD;
      any restored vision. Each subject will be followed for 5 years, with their health monitored&#xD;
      throughout. Research sessions, visual function testing, and subject-reported outcomes will be&#xD;
      used to evaluate the functioning of the system.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>

          3. Subject's vision cannot be restored with any approved medication or intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has a documented history of useful form vision.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject is between the age of 22-74 .&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject resides within 2 hours (by ground transportation) of the investigational site.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is (a) male or (b) a female of childbearing potential with a negative&#xD;
             pregnancy test who is using a reliable method of contraception or (c) a female who is&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Subject is able to complete regular office and telephone appointments per the protocol&#xD;
             requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subject is medically fit for neurosurgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is at high risk for surgical complications such as active systemic infection,&#xD;
             coagulation disorders (such as the use of anti-thrombotic therapies) or platelet count&#xD;
             below 100,000.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has history of bleeding or immune compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is taking chronic anticoagulants or antiplatelet agent or subject has an&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Subject has had prior craniotomy or brain surgery that would interfere with placement&#xD;

&#xD;
          5. Subject has evidence of active intracranial disease that would preclude elective&#xD;
             neurosurgical intervention, such as unruptured intracranial aneurysm or brain tumor,&#xD;
             or aberrant visual cortex anatomy, such as prior stroke or arteriovenous malformation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          9. Subject has a prior history of serious head injury with loss of consciousness for more&#xD;
             than 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;

             implanted with the Orion System: MR imaging, diathermy, electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
             (ECT), or transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). These medical procedures are&#xD;
             contraindicated for subjects implanted with an Orion System. Energy from these&#xD;
             procedures can be sent through the implanted brain stimulation system and cause&#xD;
             permanent brain damage which may cause severe injury, coma, or death.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subject is implanted with any neurostimulation or neuromodulation device in the head&#xD;
             including, but not limited to cochlear implant, deep brain stimulator, or auditory&#xD;

             uncontrolled systemic hypertension with values above 170/100; cardiac or pulmonary&#xD;
             disease; uncorrected coagulation abnormalities; diabetes; or any condition that would&#xD;
             render the patient unable to safely cooperate with the study tests as judged by the&#xD;
             screening physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Subject has had an alcohol or illicit substance use disorder within the last 6 months,&#xD;
             unstable remission of substance abuse, or chart evidence that co-morbid substance use&#xD;

&#xD;
         18. Subject had moderate or severe depression, as determined by a score of at least 17 on&#xD;
             the HAM-D.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Subject has had a suicide attempt in the last two years, presence of a suicide plan&#xD;
             (an answer of &quot;Yes&quot; to Question C4 in Section C-Suicidality of MINI International&#xD;
             Neuropsychiatric Interview), or a &quot;yes&quot; answer to any one of the ten suicidal ideation&#xD;
             and behavior questions on the C-SSRS.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Subject has a disease or condition that prevents understanding or communication of&#xD;
             informed consent, study demands, or testing protocols, including:&#xD;
&#xD;

                  neurologic disease&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Psychiatric disease including diagnosed forms of depression&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Does not speak a principal language associated with the region&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Deafness or selective frequency hearing loss that prevents adequate communication&#xD;
                  with the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject has a balance disability or frequently participates in contact sports.&#xD;
