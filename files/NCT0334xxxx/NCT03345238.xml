  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study aims to evaluate the differences that may be experienced in pain and&#xD;
      cervical disability, before, during and just after the intervention of the Deep Dry Needling&#xD;
      in the upper trapezius muscle in active, passive myofascial trigger points (MTP) or non-MTP&#xD;
      in Patients with neck pain, assessing, in turn, the neurophysiological effects on the&#xD;
      Autonomic Nervous System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Deep Dry Needling of active myofascial trigger points produces a greater decrease&#xD;
      of pain and cervical disability index and increase of pressure pain threshold; Than the Deep&#xD;
      Dry Needling of Myofascial Trigger Points latent or out of Myofascial Trigger Points in&#xD;
      patients with chronic neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine the efficacy of Deep Dry Needling applied on Active Myofascial&#xD;
      Triggers (MTP) vs. latent MTP versus MTP, on pain reduction and cervical disability, in&#xD;
      patients with chronic neck pain attributable to Myofascial Pain Syndrome.&#xD;

    <description>Checkin the Intensity of pain with the Visual Analogic Scale.&#xD;
It is a 100 mm line that measures the intensity of pain.The left end of the line represents the absence of pain, while the far right represents the worst pain imaginable. The numerical scale of intensity of pain adds a numerical ranking where 1 is no pain and 10 the worst pain imaginable.</description>

    <description>Using the questionnaire: Neck Disability Index&#xD;
It is the scale that has been used in more different populations and the one that has been more times validated against multiple measures of function, pain and clinical signs and symptoms. The NDI is a self-completed questionnaire with 10 sections. Each of the sections (cervical pain intensity, personal care, weight lifting, reading, headache, ability to concentrate, work capacity, driving, sleep and leisure activities) offers 6 possible answers that represent 6 levels progressive functional capacity, and scored from 0 to 5 (0 = no disability, 5 = total disability). The total score is expressed in percentage terms with respect to the maximum possible.</description>

    <description>Using the questionnaire: Catastrophic Scale of Pain&#xD;
It is a self-administered scale of 13 items and one of the most used to assess the construct &quot;catastrophization in the face of pain&quot;.&#xD;
It comprises 3 dimensions: a) rumination; b) magnification, and c) hopelessness.&#xD;
The theoretical range of the instrument is between 13 and 62, indicating low scores, little catastrophization, and high values, high catastrophization.</description>

    <description>Using the questionnaire: Chronic pain gradation scale&#xD;
It is a scale that serves as a valid, reliable and useful instrument to measure chronic pain early in clinical practice. The first factor formed by 4 items, can be called &quot;disability related to pain&quot;; the second, &quot;the intensity of pain&quot;, is made up of 3 items. The version of the scale in Spanish consists of 8 items and the final score is obtained with the sum of items 2 to 8, which results in a range of 0 to 70.</description>
