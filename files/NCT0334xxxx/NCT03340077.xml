      The aim of this study is to evaluate the utility, acceptability and feasibility of&#xD;
      incorporating pharmacist Medicines Optimisation Reviews (MORs) into routine HIV outpatient&#xD;
      care. Medicines reviews are a fundamental role of clinical pharmacists and, although&#xD;
      availability of complete medication lists has been shown to reduce the number of DDIs per&#xD;
      patient, evidence of medication reviews reducing medication related problems in PLWH is still&#xD;
      limited. The British HIV Association (BHIVA) Standards of Care for People Living with HIV&#xD;
      mandate that &quot;A complete medication review should be undertaken at least annually by the&#xD;
      specialist team, taking into consideration adherence, any difficulties with medication and&#xD;
      DDIs&quot;. However, in most clinics formal medication reviews are not routinely performed on an&#xD;
      annual basis, and a full drug history is not routinely documented, due to capacity&#xD;
      constraints and the lack of an effective and feasible tool for routine medicines reviews in&#xD;
      PLWH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Medicines Management Optimisation Review (MOR) toolkit was developed by HIV specialist&#xD;
      pharmacists (including the co-investigator, Heather Leake Date) representing a range of&#xD;
      clinics across the UK, in collaboration with Merck Sharp and Dohme (MSD). The core objective&#xD;
      of the toolkit is to enhance patient safety by identifying and reviewing all patients at&#xD;
      higher risk of polypharmacy or DDIs in the HIV outpatient setting. In the view of the HIV&#xD;
      Specialist pharmacists that developed the toolkit, it represents the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; in what&#xD;
      should be performed at outpatient appointments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tools consist of two items. 'My Clinic companion' and 'MOR consultation form'. 'My clinic&#xD;
      companion' is a patient-orientated questionnaire that promotes self-review of medications and&#xD;
      adherence and will facilitate the pharmacist consultation. The 'MOR consultation form' is&#xD;
      designed to aid a structured patient consultation using available information from local&#xD;
      databases, GP medication histories as well as that obtained directly from the patient. The&#xD;
      form also identifies key care providers involved in the patient case, including prior consent&#xD;
      to contact with information if required. It also identifies health care interventions such as&#xD;
      smoking cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, evidence of the utility, acceptability and cost-benefit of the MOR toolkit is&#xD;
      missing and with this project we aim to demonstrate that implementation of MORs in a sample&#xD;
      of UK HIV clinics using the MOR toolkit developed by NHS healthcare professionals supported&#xD;
      and funded by MSD is effective, feasible and cost-effective. By 2020 it is estimated that&#xD;
      more than 50% of the UK's HIV population will be over 50 years old, with a corresponding&#xD;
      increase in co-morbidities, DDIs and MRPs, underlining the potential importance of regular&#xD;
      medication reviews. This work will have important implications for the commissioning of HIV&#xD;
      specialist pharmacy services in England (particularly in relation to work across the&#xD;
      primary/secondary care interface, and the development of Sustainability and Transformation&#xD;
      Plans), as it will demonstrate whether MORs can be incorporated into routine practice and if&#xD;
      they are a cost-effective use of pharmacist's time.&#xD;
