  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meditation skills, or paying attention to internal mental states, are thought to improve&#xD;
      people's health. This study is developing a new brain measure of meditation skills, called&#xD;
      the EMBODY Task, using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). The investigators are&#xD;
      testing whether pattern recognition methods can be applied to fMRI data to identify mental&#xD;
      states during meditation, including attention to the body and to thoughts. This task is being&#xD;
      developed in meditation practitioners and non-meditators. The goal is to understand what&#xD;
      people are paying attention to during meditation using brain data. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that pattern recognition technology will be able to identify different mental&#xD;
      states that occur during meditation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators are developing a new functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) task (the&#xD;
      EMBODY Task) to measure mental states during meditation using pattern recognition or machine&#xD;
      learning technology. This task is being piloted and validated in 20 meditators and 20 control&#xD;
      participants, in two waves of pilot testing. Meditators will have practiced meditation for at&#xD;
      least the 5 years, at least 90 minutes weekly. Control participants will have little to no&#xD;
      meditation experience and will be age- and gender-matched to each meditator. All participants&#xD;
      will be MRI-compatible, healthy with no health conditions that affect breathing, have no&#xD;
      current psychiatric disorder, and not be taking psychotropic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the EMBODY Task, participants will be instructed to pay attention to areas of the body,&#xD;
      their thoughts, sounds in the scanner, and to stop paying attention, in short intervals&#xD;
      (16-45s). They will also meditate on their breath for 10 minutes. The investigators will&#xD;
      determine whether pattern recognition technology can distinguish 5 mental states, and whether&#xD;
      these brain patterns can be used to identify mental states during meditation. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that all 5 mental states will be distinguished by pattern&#xD;
      recognition in the meditators, and potentially in the controls. Investigators also&#xD;
      hypothesize that meditators should pay attention to their breath longer during meditation&#xD;
      compared to controls.&#xD;

    <description>The EMBODY Task is a new brain-based measure using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure meditation skills. The primary outcome measure of the EMBODY Task is whether brain patterns are recognized by pattern classification algorithms for the 5 conditions in the study (attention to breath, body, mind wandering, thoughts, and sounds) above chance levels (20% for 5 conditions, using a one-sample t-test for each condition in the entire sample). Classification accuracy is a standard outcome measure in studies that use brain pattern classification. This will demonstrate that brain patterns associated with internal attention are indeed differentiable by pattern classification methods. These brain patterns will then be used to identify the focus of attention during breath meditation.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Healthy adults, 25-65 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Meditators will be affiliated with meditation centers that are based in the Vipassana&#xD;
             tradition or Zen traditions. In the past 5 years, meditators will have a consistent&#xD;
             practice in mindfulness of body practices, where consistent practice is defined as&#xD;
             practicing for at least 90 minutes in a typical week. They will also have had at least&#xD;
             14 days of total silent retreat practice in the past 5 years. At least half of total&#xD;
             practice time as reported by the participants will be engaged in mindfulness of body&#xD;
             practices (e.g., breath meditation, body scan, mindfulness of emotions, mindful yoga,&#xD;
             walking meditation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-meditator control group. Within the past 3 years, participants will not have&#xD;
             engaged in regular meditation (including from courses such as Mindfulness-Based Stress&#xD;
             Reduction, Mindfulness-Based Cognitive Therapy, and Dialectical Behavioral Therapy),&#xD;
             yoga, or other mind-body practice (such as Tai Chi, Feldenkrais, sensory awareness, or&#xD;
             related practices), defined as more than 20 minutes of practice at least two times per&#xD;
             week. If there is experience with mind-body practices prior to the past 3 years, it&#xD;
             should not include an extended period of consistent practice (such as 20 min daily&#xD;
             practice for a year or more) or a period of intensive practice longer than 7 days&#xD;
             (e.g., 10-day silent retreat).&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. can not fit comfortably in the MRI scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. potentially confounding medical conditions that impact breathing (e.g.,asthma,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, and emphysema that are not well-controlled), could impact&#xD;
             attention to the breath (e.g., chronic pain conditions that are not well-managed), or&#xD;
             impact neural functioning (e.g., multiple sclerosis, neurological diseases, brain&#xD;
             injury);&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. currently experiencing a mental health condition (e.g., anxiety, depression, panic&#xD;
             disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, attention deficit and hyperactivity&#xD;
             disorder) or past severe mental illness such as bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, or&#xD;
             severe substance abuse disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. use of psychotropic medications in the past year&#xD;

             interoceptive focus in the past week (including narcotics, benzodiazepines); if the&#xD;
             research assistant is unclear about a specific medication, the physician on the study&#xD;
             (Dr. Rick Hecht) will be asked and will decide;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. health behaviors that could affect respiration (e.g., DSM-IV diagnosis of substance&#xD;
             use disorder, use of major recreational drugs in the past year-heroin, cocaine, etc.);&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. any high-level training in a field that could impact body awareness and is not&#xD;
             associated with mind-body practices (e.g., professional athletes or dancers, marathon&#xD;
             runners);&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. lack of ability to speak and read English fluently (instructions and questionnaires&#xD;
             will be in English only and foreign language translations will have to await future&#xD;
             studies);&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. For participants who consent to the fMRI study, exclusion criteria include&#xD;
             contra-indications for safety and data quality in the MRI scanner (see MRI screening&#xD;
             form): presence of ferromagnetic metal on or in the body, pregnancy, movement disorder&#xD;
             which prevents lying still in the scanner, claustrophobia, braces, and corrected&#xD;
             vision that is not within +/- 8.&#xD;
