  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antimicrobial resistance is one of today's most urgent public health problems. One of the&#xD;
      most important strategies to slow the spread of antimicrobial resistance is the promotion of&#xD;
      judicious antimicrobial use. There are tremendous opportunities to reduce unnecessary&#xD;
      antimicrobial-prescribing, particularly in Emergency Departments (EDs). In this study, the&#xD;
      investigators will work collaboratively with ED providers in the Veterans Health&#xD;
      Administration (VHA) to reduce unnecessary antimicrobial use. Academic-detailing and an&#xD;
      audit-and-feedback intervention will be implemented, and the study will assess how overall&#xD;
      antimicrobial-prescribing changes once these interventions are performed. ED providers will&#xD;
      be shown how their antimicrobial-prescribing compares to their peers, thereby encouraging&#xD;
      them to consider their professional reputation when making prescribing decisions. To assess&#xD;
      the impact of this intervention, the study will monitor providers' antimicrobial-prescribing&#xD;
      behavior through an automated metric, i.e. number of antimicrobial prescriptions per number&#xD;
      of patient-visits. To assess changes in the appropriateness of antimicrobial-prescribing, the&#xD;
      study team will also perform manual chart reviews and compare prescribing decisions to&#xD;
      published guidelines.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using a quasi-experimental design, the study team will work collaboratively with ED providers&#xD;
      in the Veterans Health Administration (VHA) to improve antimicrobial-prescribing.&#xD;
      Academic-detailing and an audit-and-feedback intervention will be implemented. Through&#xD;
      audit-and-feedback, providers will be shown how their antimicrobial-prescribing compares to&#xD;
      their peers, thereby encouraging them to consider their professional reputation when making&#xD;
      prescribing decisions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a pretest-posttest design (quasi-experimental design with a non-equivalent&#xD;
      control group) to assess the effect of our pilot intervention at 2 participating EDs and 2&#xD;
      control EDs. For each ED, the pretest period will be the 12 months prior to the intervention.&#xD;
      The intervention itself will last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an estimated 30 ED providers at the 2 study sites and 30 ED providers at the 2&#xD;
      control sites. Only antimicrobial prescriptions to patients discharged from the ED will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be antimicrobial-prescribing volume adjusted for the total number of&#xD;
      patient-visits. Secondary outcomes include the frequency of guideline-discordant&#xD;
      antimicrobial-prescribing and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the conclusion of the pilot trial, a quasi-experimental interrupted time-series (ITS)&#xD;
      analysis will be performed to assess the change in monthly antimicrobial usage for the 2&#xD;
      intervention sites combined and the 2 control sites combined. The time frame for this ITS&#xD;
      analysis will be the one-year prior to the pilot trial's initiation through the trial's&#xD;
      1-year intervention period for a total of 24 months. In addition, a multivariable analysis&#xD;
      will be performed to identify predictors of guideline-discordant therapy.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patient-visits Prescribed an Antimicrobial at Their ED Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be calculated every month during the baseline and intervention periods. An interrupted time-series analysis will be performed to evaluate how this monthly percentage changed after the intervention period began.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcomes is defined as the total number of antimicrobial-prescribing visits divided by the total number of patient-visits. This metric will be calculated on a monthly basis for each site (2 intervention, 2 control). It will be calculated during the baseline and intervention periods. Therefore, each site will contribute 24 data points.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patient-visits Prescribed a Late Antimicrobial Prescription More Than 24 Hours After But Within 30 Days of Their ED Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>For both intervention and control sites, the outcome will be reported as a monthly median, which is calculated across the 12 baseline and the 12 intervention months.</time_frame>
    <description>Late antimicrobial prescription is defined as the prescription of an (additional) antimicrobial by any provider more than 24 hours after but within 30 days of the patient's ED visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patient-visits Who Were Hospitalized More Than 24 Hours After But Within 30 Days of Their ED Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>For both intervention and control sites, the outcome will be reported as a monthly median, which is calculated across the 12 baseline and the 12 intervention months.</time_frame>
    <description>Hospitalization is defined as the need for hospitalization for any indication at a VA-facility more than 24 hours after but within 30 days of the patient's index visit to the ED.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patient-visits Who Died More Than 24 Hours After But Within 30 Days of Their ED Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>For both intervention and control sites, the outcome will be reported as a monthly median, which is calculated across the 12 baseline and the 12 intervention months.</time_frame>
    <description>Death is defined as all-cause death more than 24 hours after and within 30-days of the patient's ED visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patient-visits Who Underwent Clostridium Difficile Testing More Than 24 Hours After But Within 30 Days of Their ED Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>For both intervention and control sites, the outcome will be reported as a monthly median, which is calculated across the 12 baseline and the 12 intervention months.</time_frame>
    <description>Clostridium difficile testing is defined as a laboratory test for Clostridium difficile ordered more than 24 hours after but within 30-days of the patient's ED visit.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patient-visits Who Received Guideline Concordant Antimicrobial Management</measure>
    <time_frame>For the baseline and intervention periods, this outcome will be reported as the percentage of patients who received guideline-concordant management among the sample of qualifying ED visits that were randomly selected for manual chart review.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome was assessed using blinded manual chart reviews in a randomly selected sample of patients that met inclusion criteria, as outlined in our study protocol. For this reason, the denominators for this outcome will not match the patient counts for the other outcomes. If a patient received an antimicrobial when indicated or did not receive an antimicrobial when not indicated, the patient was deemed to have received guideline-concordant management. During the baseline period, 497 charts were randomly selected for review, and 480 ultimately underwent adjudication. During the intervention period, 576 charts were randomly selected for review, and 455 underwent adjudication.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Patient-visits Prescribed an Antibiotic at Their ED Visit</measure>
    <time_frame>This outcome will be calculated every month during the baseline and intervention periods. An interrupted time-series analysis will be performed to evaluate how this monthly percentage changed after the intervention period began.</time_frame>
    <description>This outcomes is defined as the total number of antibacterial-prescribing visits divided by the total number of patient-visits. This metric will be calculated on a monthly basis for each site (2 intervention, 2 control). It will be calculated during the baseline and intervention periods. Therefore, each site will contribute 24 data points.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>We performed a quasi-experimental study with an interrupted time-series design and a matched-pair non-equivalent control group. There were 2 intervention sites and 2 control sites; 27/31 providers were enrolled at intervention sites. We measured outcomes in the PATIENTS seen at these 4 EDs. In a difference-in-differences analysis, outcomes were compared across intervention and control sites in patients seen before the intervention period (i.e. baseline) to those during the intervention period.</recruitment_details>

        <description>This outcome was assessed using blinded manual chart reviews in a randomly selected sample of patients that met inclusion criteria, as outlined in our study protocol. For this reason, the denominators for this outcome will not match the patient counts for the other outcomes. If a patient received an antimicrobial when indicated or did not receive an antimicrobial when not indicated, the patient was deemed to have received guideline-concordant management. During the baseline period, 497 charts were randomly selected for review, and 480 ultimately underwent adjudication. During the intervention period, 576 charts were randomly selected for review, and 455 underwent adjudication.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Patient-visits Who Received Guideline Concordant Antimicrobial Management</title>
          <description>This outcome was assessed using blinded manual chart reviews in a randomly selected sample of patients that met inclusion criteria, as outlined in our study protocol. For this reason, the denominators for this outcome will not match the patient counts for the other outcomes. If a patient received an antimicrobial when indicated or did not receive an antimicrobial when not indicated, the patient was deemed to have received guideline-concordant management. During the baseline period, 497 charts were randomly selected for review, and 480 ultimately underwent adjudication. During the intervention period, 576 charts were randomly selected for review, and 455 underwent adjudication.</description>
          <population>For the Outcome Measure Data Table shown below, patient-visits were stratified by period (i.e. baseline and intervention period), and outcomes were compared across these two periods at intervention and control sites. Please see our statistical analysis plan for further details. For the intervention and control sites, the &quot;overall number of participants analyzed&quot; in the Arms/Groups table equals the sum of the &quot;number analyzed&quot; for the baseline and intervention periods, as shown below.</population>

By conducting a time-series analysis, we tried to account for confounders that may change over time, and by including a matched-control group, we tried to minimize the possibility of regression to the mean. Second, we cannot exclude the possibility that sites had any other processes in place that could have influenced our outcomes.</limitations_and_caveats>
