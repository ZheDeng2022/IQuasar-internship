  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who receive dialysis for kidney failure suffer severe cognitive impairment.&#xD;
      Hemodialysis causes circulatory stress and ischemia, which causes severe brain injury. It has&#xD;
      been demonstrated that a procedure known as Remote Ischemic Preconditioning(RIPC), which&#xD;
      involves wrapping a blood pressure cuff around a patient's leg and inflating has the&#xD;
      potential of protecting many organs, such as the heart from the effects of dialysis. Our&#xD;
      study aims to investigate this phenomenon to determine the extent to which it provides&#xD;
      protection to a dialysis patient's brain.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemodialysis patients suffer severe cognitive impairment: Abnormalities of cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (predominately sub-cortical defects in executive decision making) are almost&#xD;
      universal in hemodialysis (HD) patients and appear early after starting dialysis. Around 75%&#xD;
      of patients exhibit mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and a high proportion (˜15%) have&#xD;
      dementia. Mechanisms of injury: It has been demonstrated that HD associated circulatory&#xD;
      stress and recurrent regional ischemia drives brain injury. The extent of injury is&#xD;
      determined by the degree of BP instability during HD. Peritoneal dialysis patients are not&#xD;
      subject to the same stress and retain cognitive abilities. The injury is multifactorial, and&#xD;
      amenable to HD based intervention. Optimizing dialysis to minimize harm requires&#xD;
      understanding the wide range of potential of pathophysiological processes contributing to&#xD;
      this injury. Putative components of pathophysiology that might be amenable to intervention&#xD;
      include: a) Direct reduction in tissue perfusion is the characteristic consequence of HD&#xD;
      driven multi-organ injury. The investigators have directly visualized this in multiple organ&#xD;
      beds during dialysis (heart, gut and kidney), and have inferred it in the brain from the&#xD;
      development of ischemic based white matter (WM) injury. b) Inflammation drives WM&#xD;
      injury.Endotoxin (derived from gut bacteria) is profoundly pro- inflammatory and translocates&#xD;
      from intestinal lumen into the circulation during HD treatment directly causing WM&#xD;
      inflammation. Daily HD (gentler fluid removal) normalizes endotoxemia and markers of&#xD;
      inflammation. c) Release of the excitotoxic neurotransmitter, glutamate, produces injury in&#xD;
      ischemia. Plasma levels are lower in HD patients with less ongoing brain injury. Removal of&#xD;
      glutamate by dialysis significantly reduces ischemic injury severity and functional&#xD;
      consequences. Previous success in protecting the brain during dialysis: The Investigator&#xD;
      recently completed a successful multi- centre RCT of cooled dialysis fluid to abrogate WM&#xD;
      progressive injury- strongly supporting the integral role that the HD process plays in brain&#xD;
      injury. Hemodialysis patients have specific patterns of progressive brain injury: Currently&#xD;
      the problem of dialysis induced functionally significant brain injury is typically not well&#xD;
      recognized or a focus of care. Leukoaraiosis describes rarefaction of brain WM, typically&#xD;
      associated with vascular cognitive impairment. It is universally present in HD patients (even&#xD;
      when correcting for BP). Severity of reduction in cognitive function is proportional to the&#xD;
      amount of WM injury, with a predominant loss of subcortical functions (executive&#xD;
      functioning). The Investigators have previously demonstrated that the signature of the change&#xD;
      in fractional anisotropy in dialysis patients was entirely explained by changes in radial&#xD;
      diffusivity, rather than axial diffusivity- pathognomonic of a vascular etiology. Urgent need&#xD;
      to develop additional interventions: Although dialysis fluid cooling appears to be effective&#xD;
      in helping to protect against WM injury, there are limitations. The degree of cooling that&#xD;
      can be applied is limited in some patients by cold symptom tolerability and effectiveness has&#xD;
      only been tested in patients new to HD. Patients with more established injury may require&#xD;
      additional therapies. These need to be suitable for combination with other emerging dialysis&#xD;
      based therapies. Ideally they will be universally applicable, independent of dialysis machine&#xD;
      type, low-cost, safe, well tolerated, and simple-requiring few healthcare resources to apply.&#xD;
      Remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC): Ischemic conditioning occurs when a transient&#xD;
      non-lethal episode of ischemia reduces the effect of a subsequent larger insult. Similar&#xD;
      levels of protection can be achieved by applying brief episodes of ischemia (with a BP cuff&#xD;
      on a limb) remote from a target organ. Successful clinical studies using RIPC have been&#xD;
      performed to provide protection against ischemia in many organs, including acute stroke, and&#xD;
      can prevent leukoaraiosis in animal models. RIPC provides protection against HD-induced acute&#xD;
      myocardial injury: The investigators have recently completed a pilot RCT demonstrating a RIPC&#xD;
      intervention reduced HD-induced acute cardiac injury by 50%, after only a single application.&#xD;
      This effect was maintained over a period of 28 days. RIPC was effective, safe and well&#xD;
      tolerated. The investigators are currently engaged in a larger Canadian based study to refine&#xD;
      the optimum RIPC regime to provide protection against HD-induced cardiac injury. Interim&#xD;
      analysis of this study has confirmed similar levels of efficacy in a Canadian population and&#xD;
      allowed us to select the maximally effective RIPC regime, for use in the current proposed&#xD;
      study. Clear translational pathway: This project is conceived in an integrated framework of&#xD;
      new therapeutic target discovery, intervention development and sequential testing of safety&#xD;
      and efficacy. The investigators will use clinically relevant surrogate imaging endpoints for&#xD;
      rapid evaluation and refinement of candidate intervention, prior to large-scale testing with&#xD;
      survival-based endpoints. The Investigators have already developed a prototype phase III&#xD;
      equivalent study. MY-TEMP is an Ontario based cluster randomized study of individualized&#xD;
      dialysate cooling (trials registration NCT 02628366), funded in partnership by the Heart and&#xD;
      Stroke Foundation, Ontario Ministry of Health and US based large dialysis provider&#xD;
      organizations. All 7000 patients will be randomized in Q3 2016. Impact: HD patients&#xD;
      characteristically suffer from cognitive impairment. Understanding the mechanisms behind this&#xD;
      will allow the development of therapies integrated into dialysis treatment delivery&#xD;
      (anti-ischemic, but potentially also directed at issues such as inflammation and dialyzable&#xD;
      injury factors), helping patients maintain cognitive vitality, independence and maximize&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
