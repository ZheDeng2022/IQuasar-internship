      The present study aims to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of exhaled breath analysis with&#xD;
      the Aeonose (the eNose Company, Zutphen, the Netherlands) to distinguish the breath of&#xD;
      patients suspected for CRC (based on a positive fecal immunochemical test), who are truly&#xD;
      diagnosed with CRC, from patients suspected for CRC in whom this diagnosis is rejected after&#xD;
      colonoscopy.&#xD;

      Study rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy plays a key role in all colorectal cancer (CRC) screening modalities. An&#xD;
      important limitation of colonoscopy remains that the diagnostic accuracy and therapeutic&#xD;
      safety of colonoscopy both depend on several physician and patient-related factors.&#xD;
      Significant amounts of polyps are missed during colonoscopy and severe untoward effects still&#xD;
      occur in 0.1%-0.3% of all colonoscopy procedures, even among expert examiners. Moreover, the&#xD;
      burdensome nature of the procedure and the necessity of full bowel preparation negatively&#xD;
      influences participation rates and the use of colonoscopy as a CRC screening test is limited&#xD;
      by healthcare costs and the expertise needed to perform the screening. These disadvantages of&#xD;
      colonoscopy warrant the development of a new, non-invasive, accurate CRC screening test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An electronic nose device is an artificial olfactory system that analyses volate organic&#xD;
      compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. The use of electronic noses has already been assessed as&#xD;
      a potential non-invasive diagnostic biomarker test for lung cancer, breast cancer and&#xD;
      malignant melanomas. The present study aims to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of exhaled&#xD;
      breath analysis with the AeonoseTM (The eNose Company, Zutphen, the Netherlands) to&#xD;
      distinguish the breath of patients suspected for CRC (based on a positive fecal&#xD;
      immunochemical test (FIT)), who are truly diagnosed with CRC, from patients suspected for CRC&#xD;
      in whom this diagnosis is rejected after colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of exhaled breath analysis with the AeonoseTM to&#xD;
           distinguish the breath of patients suspected for CRC based on a positive FIT test, who&#xD;
           are truly diagnosed with CRC, from patients suspected for CRC in whom this diagnosis is&#xD;
           rejected after colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the diagnostic accuracy of exhaled breath analysis with the AeonoseTM for&#xD;
           other (pre-)malignant colon lesions (e.g. advanced adenomas, non-advanced adenomas, and&#xD;
           sessile serrated lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the acceptance rate of using the AeonoseTM device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The present multicenter study will include 1950 FIT-positive patients. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in seven hospitals in the Netherlands. First a database of breath&#xD;
      prints will be developed to detect CRC. In this study phase the AeonoseTM will be trained and&#xD;
      the database of breath prints will be verified using &quot;leave 10% out&quot; cross validation. After&#xD;
      the calibration phase the diagnostic accuracy of AeonoseTM will be assessed in new study&#xD;
      patients (external validation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients between the ages of 55 and 75 years old with a positive FIT-test&#xD;
      referred for a colonoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability of AeonoseTM to distinguish between patients with and without CRC in a&#xD;
           FIT-positive population in terms of sensitivity and specificity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diagnostic accuracy of AeonoseTM for other (pre-)malignant colon lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acceptance rate of AeonoseTM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on demographic and baseline characteristics will be summarized for continuous variables,&#xD;
      in case of normal distribution by mean and standard deviation, and in case of non-normal&#xD;
      distribution by median and interquartile range. For discrete variables (eg, race and sex)&#xD;
      data will be summarized by proportions (percentages). Differences in baseline characteristics&#xD;
      will be determined using independent sample t test, Fisher's exact test or Chi-square test,&#xD;
      when appropriate. A 2-sided p-value &lt;0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be analyzed by an artificial neural network (ANN) to identify data classifiers&#xD;
      to extract differences between the patterns in patients by the presence or absence of CRC in&#xD;
      biopsies. By analyzing a group of breath prints from patients with and without CRC,&#xD;
      individual differences of diet, medications, co-morbidities, and other factors can be&#xD;
      filtered out to identify features that distinguish the compounds of patients with CRC. This&#xD;
      process continues until a selected level of discrimination is met. Data compression and ANN&#xD;
      have been integrated in a proprietary software package (Aethena) of the eNose Company&#xD;
      (Zutphen, the Netherlands).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The binary results will be presented in a scatterplot and a receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristics curve (ROC-curve). Matthews correlation coefficients will be calculated to&#xD;
      measure the quality of binary classifications. Cross-validation of the data will be performed&#xD;
      using a leave-10%-out method. A portion of the data is left out to predict the most optimal&#xD;
      model.&#xD;

    <description>An electronic nose device is an artificial olfactory system that analyses volate organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath. The AeonoseTM is a handheld device of 650 gram. A nose clip will be used to prevent the entry of non-filtered air and patients will be instructed to enclose the mouthpiece with their mouth at all times. A measurement cycle lasts for about 15 minutes, of which 5 minutes of in-and exhalation by the patient takes place.</description>
