    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to evaluate the preliminary impact of a&#xD;
      public-health-partnered tele-pharmacist model for pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivery in&#xD;
      a rural state (&quot;TelePrEP&quot;). In brief, PrEP involves daily use of a medication (i.e. Truvada)&#xD;
      to prevent HIV infection among people at risk for infection due to sexual exposure or needle&#xD;
      sharing. In this study, PrEP eligible rural and small urban-dwelling public health clients&#xD;
      wil be enrolled in a prospective study to follow their progression through PrEP care&#xD;
      following public health referrals. The study will involve a baseline survey to gather data on&#xD;
      participant beliefs and attitudes about PrEP and a follow up telephone survey 30-40 days&#xD;
      later to ascertain whether participants have engaged in PrEP. Medical records will be&#xD;
      requested as a second method to determine whether participants have started PrEP and whether&#xD;
      they are still using PrEP after six months. The hypotheses that PrEP initiation and retention&#xD;
      are higher in regions with TelePrEP programs will be tested against control regions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Iowa Department of Public Health (IDPH) and The University of Iowa (UI) have collaborated&#xD;
      to develop a public-health-partnered tele-pharmacist model that meets these needs&#xD;
      (&quot;TelePrEP&quot;). TelePrEP was developed and piloted as a quality improvement program and uses&#xD;
      only standard of care interventions (e.g. PrEP) and routinely applied healthcare delivery&#xD;
      strategies (e.g. telemedicine, pharmacist collaborative practice models). In overview,&#xD;
      TelePrEP begins by systematically identifying clients with PrEP indications in county public&#xD;
      health clinics and affiliated sexually-transmitted disease (STD) programs serving rural and&#xD;
      small urban communities in Iowa. Public health personnel then refer clients with PrEP&#xD;
      indications to a tele-pharmacist service at UIHC that uses mobile video visits,&#xD;
      locally-obtained laboratory studies, and medication delivery by mail to provide PrEP, without&#xD;
      requiring in-person provider visits. The overall goal is to improve PrEP access and&#xD;
      engagement in rural and small urban areas by systematically identifying high risk-individuals&#xD;
      in public health programs, and referring these individuals to a geographically-scalable&#xD;
      tele-pharmacist PrEP clinic that overcomes barriers related to distance and stigma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TelePrEP program was piloted locally in Johnson County, and in 2018 the IDPH and UI will&#xD;
      collaborate to scale it up across Iowa. In parallel with scale up of the TelePrEP program, a&#xD;
      research study will be conducted to determine the impact of TelePrEP on PrEP use among rural&#xD;
      and small urban -dwelling public health clients. In a quasi-experimental study, the local&#xD;
      public health departments in Iowa and their affiliated HIV/STD programs will be divided into&#xD;
      TelePrEP intervention and control groups, based on geographic region. This is appropriate&#xD;
      because it will not be feasible to implement the TelePrEP program in all Public health sites&#xD;
      simultaneously, so some sites will start the program later than others by necessity. Public&#xD;
      health personnel in control regions will refer PrEP-eligible clients to available&#xD;
      community-based PrEP providers, the current &quot;standard of care.&quot; Public health personnel in&#xD;
      TelePrEP intervention regions will refer clients to their choice of in-person visits with&#xD;
      available community PrEP providers or TelePrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: Estimate the impact of TelePrEP on the overall rate of PrEP engagement&#xD;
      among rural and small urban public health clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare total rates of PrEP engagement among PrEP-eligible clients in intervention&#xD;
           and control regions, defining PrEP engagement as any provider visit (i.e. in-person&#xD;
           community provider visit or tele-pharmacist) to discuss PrEP AND a Truvada® prescription&#xD;
           within 30 days of public health referral.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 1: TelePrEP will increase PrEP engagement from 5% in control regions to 25%&#xD;
           in TelePrEP intervention regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: Quantify retention of public health clients in TelePrEP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following PrEP engagement, we will measure the proportion of clients who are retained in&#xD;
           PrEP six months following engagement, defining retention as a tele-pharmacist video or&#xD;
           community PrEP provider visit between days 150 and 210 with self-reported Truvada® use&#xD;
           in the past week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2a: Over 50% of clients engaging in TelePrEP will be retained at 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypothesis 2b: Retention in PrEP will be greater in TelePrEP regions.&#xD;

    <description>Public health personnel identify PrEP-eligible clients.&#xD;
PrEP-eligible clients are given a list of PrEP providers in Iowa and a brochure with info on getting PrEP. Clients are referred to a PrEP navigator, who facilitates linkage to clients' choice of TelePrEP or to community PreP providers.&#xD;
Public health clients choosing TelePrEP complete a video visit with the tele-pharmacist and obtain PrEP relevant lab tests.&#xD;
PrEP medication is mailed to the client and follow up video visits and lab testing are performed.&#xD;
Within 7 days of enrollment, the subject will complete a survey regarding PrEP beliefs (20 minutes).&#xD;
30 to 40 days after enrollment, the subject will complete a second survey with 4 questions about initiation of PrEP since study enrollment (10 minutes).&#xD;
6 months following enrollment, a study team member will obtain medical records for the subject from PrEP providers in Iowa to determine if the subject has initiated and been retained in PrEP.</description>
