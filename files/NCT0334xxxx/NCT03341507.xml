  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the efficiency of the rigid tube for laryngoscopy for tracheal&#xD;
      intubation in patients with presumed difficult airway and compare the classical laryngoscopy&#xD;
      and this method in matter of glottis visualisation and tracheal intubation.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rigid tube for laryngoscopy is a 15 to 30 cm long metallic tube with a bevel end and a&#xD;
      diameter of 0.5-2.0 cm , an instrument used to inspect the larynx and surrounding areas. It&#xD;
      resembles a rigid bronchoscope but it is shorter. When in use, it has to be attached to a&#xD;
      light source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study stands that the rigid tube for laryngoscopy could be more&#xD;
      efficient in tracheal intubation for difficult airway patients when the classical intubation&#xD;
      with a curved blade laryngoscope is unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retromolar approach in both sides together with bougie(intubating tube introducer)&#xD;
      intubation is the technique of intubation used in this study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A group of patients with difficult airway criteria will be intubated using the rigid tube for laryngoscopy. A classical laryngoscopy with a McIntosh laryngoscope will be performed prior intubation and the Cormack-Lehane grade of glottis visualisation will be noted. If the Cormack -Lehane grade of glotic visualisation 2b, 3 or 4, the intubation maneuvre is carried further with the rigid tube. If the Cormack-Lehane glottic visualisation grade is less than 2b (1 or 2a) the intubation is accomplished with the MacIntosh laryngoscope (conventional laryngoscope) and the patient is excluded from the study from that point further.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Conventional laryngoscopy was performed with a MacIntosh curved blade laryngoscope, and the Cormack-Lehane grade of glottic visualization was registered.

          <title>The Simplified Airway Risk Index Scale(SARI) score ≥ 5.</title>
          <description>The Simplified Airway Risk Index (or SARI) is a multivariate risk score for predicting difficult tracheal intubation. The SARI score ranges from 0 to 12 points, where a higher number of points indicates a more difficult airway. A SARI score of 4 or above indicate a difficult intubation. Seven parameters are used to calculate the SARI score: Mouth opening, thyromental distance, Mallampati score, movement of the neck, the ability to create an underbite, body weight and previous intubation history.</description>

    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>This is an observational single-center study that relies on personal perception and the skill of a limited number of investigators. To master the rigid tube a period of training and regular use is needed.&#xD;
The major disadvantage of the rigid tube for laryngoscopy is the reduced visual field which can be improved by increasing the tube diameter. The bougie intubation carries the risk of vocal cords injury and impossibility of advancing the tracheal tube if the respiratory space is too narrow.</limitations_and_caveats>
