    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is a leading cause of mortality among women in developing countries. A key&#xD;
      factor has been the failure to achieve good coverage. The development in the last years of&#xD;
      HPV-DNA based tests has changed the scenario, because it combines a high performance to&#xD;
      detect disease with a reduction of screening frequency. Through self-testing, HPV testing has&#xD;
      the potential of reducing social and health service barriers faced by women to access&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is carried out in Jujuy, one of the Argentinian provinces with highest cervical&#xD;
      cancer mortality rates and where HPV testing has been introduced as a primary screening test&#xD;
      for all women attending public health sector. The study was conducted between July&#xD;
      2012-December 2013, and supported by the Argentinean National Cancer Institute. The protocol&#xD;
      was approved by the institutional review committees of the Ministry of Health of Jujuy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is a randomized by population clusters study that aims to assess the effectiveness&#xD;
      of self-testing to increase coverage. The aims of this study are: a) to assess the self-test&#xD;
      effectiveness to increase the participation of women in screening programs, b) to assess the&#xD;
      self-test acceptability by women, c) to assess HPV self-test effectiveness measurement for&#xD;
      the detection of CIN2+ lesions against cytology in primary screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overall number of 200 community health workers (CHWs) from the Primary Health Care System&#xD;
      (PHCS) of Jujuy will be randomized into two groups that will be named Self-test Group (ST)&#xD;
      and Conventional Sample Group (CS):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ST Group: CHWs will invite eligible women of their area to choose between doing a&#xD;
           self-test or having a conventional sample taken by a health professional of the closest&#xD;
           health care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CS Group: CHWs will invite eligible women in their area to have a conventional sample&#xD;
           taken by a health care professional of the nearest health care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to measure the self-test relative sensitivity against cytology to detect CIN2+ in&#xD;
      primary screening, all the women in the Self-test Group who have decided to do the self-test&#xD;
      and all the women of 30 years of age and older that were screened with cytology by the&#xD;
      provincial program for the prevention of cervical cancer in 2011 will be considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A database built specifically for the study will be used; it will hold the list of eligible&#xD;
      women to participate in the study. The records of women of 30 years of age and older residing&#xD;
      in the areas included in the study will be imported from the PHCS databases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the data surveyed by the study will be uploaded: randomization Group, presence&#xD;
      of the woman at home during the CHW's visit, agreement to participate in the study,&#xD;
      realization of self-test (in the corresponding group), and if appropriate, reasons for not&#xD;
      doing the self-test. Lastly, the HPV Test realization will be uploaded importing the data on&#xD;
      SITAM, (link of data done as from the identity card number).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-test acceptability: Acceptability is defined as the number of women accepting the&#xD;
      self-test against the number of women offered the option between the self-test and the&#xD;
      conventional sample (proportion of women accepting the self-test). The acceptability in this&#xD;
      population will be estimated as the average of acceptabilities calculated by CHW, as to&#xD;
      control the impact of the CHWs on acceptability and reach an appropriate variance estimate.&#xD;
      Besides, the variability introduced by the CHWs on acceptability will be studied and the&#xD;
      results obtained by male and female CHWs will be compared, as well as those obtained by the&#xD;
      CHWs in rural and urban areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self-test effectiveness to enhance participation of women in screening and diagnosis: There&#xD;
      will be a comparison of the percentage of women that did the HPV test in the Self-test group&#xD;
      and the Conventional sample group. Three different coverage indicators will be considered for&#xD;
      every CHW. These will be defined as the number of women screened within the field work&#xD;
      regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The number of women reached by the CHW who accepted participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of eligible women for that CHW (regardless of whether the CHW was able to&#xD;
           contact them or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the strategy (offering the self-test option against promotion of the&#xD;
      conventional sample) will be estimated for each one of the coverage measures using a means&#xD;
      difference test or a non-parametric test for independent samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIN 2+ detection rate: The effectiveness of the HPV Self-test against screening cytology to&#xD;
      detect CIN2+ will be estimated as the detection rates difference and as the detection rates&#xD;
      ratio. In addition, there will be a comparison of the CIN2+ detection rate in the group of&#xD;
      women who did the self-test against the total number of women in the province of Jujuy that&#xD;
      were tested for HPV (conventional sample strategy + triage Pap test) until December 2012.&#xD;

      Description of the problem and study rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      High screening coverage of women at higher risk is an essential component within organized&#xD;
      cervical cancer (CC) prevention programs. Yet, reaching high levels of coverage is a&#xD;
      challenge, mainly for programs implemented in developing countries that, in most cases, have&#xD;
      not achieved high coverage levels to effectively have an impact on the incidence and&#xD;
      mortality of the disease1,2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Argentina, it is estimated that 40% of poor women have never participated in screening&#xD;
      programs3. It has been shown that it is among those women with low screening frequency that&#xD;
      cervical cancer is mainly diagnosed4. In our country, the coverage map shows an inverse&#xD;
      correspondence with the cervical cancer mortality map. Women living in the Northwest and&#xD;
      Northeast regions, where mortality rates are highest, are the most likely to be screening&#xD;
      underusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of information about CC prevention, the lack of support networks, shame related to&#xD;
      sexuality and the body, and fear of cancer are factors that hinder an informed&#xD;
      decision-making process by women about their own health care. In turn, the autonomy of women&#xD;
      is often conditioned by the characteristics of the health systems responding to a top-down&#xD;
      and medicalized system where there is an asymmetry of knowledge and power between health care&#xD;
      professionals and users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the discovery of the causal association between oncogenic HPV (Human Papilloma Virus)&#xD;
      and CC, new screening HPV detection-based tools have been developed. The hybrid capture HPV&#xD;
      test (HC2) detects the presence of DNA of the 13 high oncogenic risk types in the woman's&#xD;
      cervix. It's been proved that the HPV test is highly effective for the detection of&#xD;
      pre-cancerous lesions and reduction of cervical cancer mortality5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the province of Jujuy CC HC2 is available in all public health centers since 2011, with&#xD;
      the aim of improving the effectiveness in the detection of high-grade lesions and cancer and&#xD;
      reduce mortality rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the challenges for programs introducing HPV testing is to continue improving the&#xD;
      screening coverage indicators. This new technology has the potential to reduce screening&#xD;
      access barriers, given the fact that the HPV test allows for self-testing, a practice that&#xD;
      can be done at home. With the self-test the woman collects herself a vaginal sample with a&#xD;
      brush used for that purpose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies carried out in different countries of the world and Latin America have shown that the&#xD;
      HPV self-test acceptability is high6. The vaginal self-test allows to overcome some of the&#xD;
      barriers associated with screening such as geographical accessibility and shame of having a&#xD;
      sample taken by a health professional. That is, the self-test has a big potential to increase&#xD;
      screening coverage, allowing women enhanced autonomy for their cervical cancer prevention&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HC2 HPV test is a molecular biology technology that detects the presence of 13 high&#xD;
      oncogenic risk DNA types (16, 18, 31, 33, 35, 39, 45, 51, 52, 56, 58, 59, and 68) in the&#xD;
      cervix cells. It is an accurate technology, highly reproducible and with an estimated&#xD;
      sensitivity of more than 90%, much higher than the cytology. Different studies in Latin&#xD;
      America and the world account for the HPV Test higher sensitivity against&#xD;
      cytology7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the same time, the HC2 HPV test is the only one in the world whose effectiveness to reduce&#xD;
      cervical cancer incidence and mortality has been scientifically proved. A study conducted in&#xD;
      India15 concluded that the rates of incidence and mortality were significantly higher within&#xD;
      the groups screened with cytology or visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) as compared to&#xD;
      the group screened with HC2. HC2 test screening was able to reach a reduction of almost 50%&#xD;
      in the mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As far as the self-test, its higher sensitivity against cytology for the detection of cervix&#xD;
      cancer precursor lesions (CIN2+) was also observed in various studies11,16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CIN2+ detection rate (histologically confirmed diagnosis) also shows a relative advantage&#xD;
      of the HPV test over cytology. Different studies have found that detection of CIN2+ is higher&#xD;
      in the case of the self-test against cytology 17,18. On the other hand, a study carried out&#xD;
      in Mexico found that the CIN2+ lesions self-test detection rate is 3.4 times higher over that&#xD;
      of cytology (relative sensitivity)19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The province of Jujuy was selected to develop this study due to the fact that screening based&#xD;
      on HPV testing as a primary test was introduced in 2011. The province of Jujuy has a high&#xD;
      mortality rate (11.8 x 100.000 women over the 2008-2011 period) and it is one of the&#xD;
      provinces set as a priority in the National Program for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer.&#xD;
      The Primary Health Care System (PHC) integrates approximately 700 CHWs that once a semester&#xD;
      visit approximately 110.000 households. In each visit, CHWs contact adults in the household&#xD;
      and perform health-related tasks including promotion of cervical cancer screening. CHW's&#xD;
      performance is evaluated annually and classified as good or regular.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goals of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cluster randomized trial will be conducted; it will include a total number of 150-200&#xD;
      community Health Workers (CHWs) and 6.000 women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to assess the self-test effectiveness to increase the participation of women in&#xD;
           screening programs,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to assess the self-test acceptability by women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to assess HPV self-test effectiveness for detection of CIN2+ lesions against cytology in&#xD;
           primary screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study randomized by population clusters&#xD;
&#xD;
      An overall number of 150-200 CHWs from the Primary Health Care System (PHCS) of the Province&#xD;
      of Jujuy will be randomized into two groups: Self-test Group (ST) and Conventional Sample&#xD;
      Group (CS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. ST Group: CHWs will invite eligible women of their area to choose between doing a&#xD;
           self-test or having a conventional sample taken by a health professional at the closest&#xD;
           health care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CS Group: CHWs will invite eligible women in their area to have a conventional sample&#xD;
           taken by a health care professional at the nearest health care center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Procedures to carry out in each group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1) Active search&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Self-test Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the home visits that CHWs carry during health rounds, selected CHWs will visit every&#xD;
      household they are in charge of and will invite eligible women to participate in the study,&#xD;
      providing them with the necessary information about the goals and activities involved.&#xD;
      Eligible women willing to participate in the study will be invited to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent. Next, they will be offered the possibility of doing a self-test or to visit a health&#xD;
      care center to have a sample taken by a health care professional. Women who agree on the&#xD;
      self-test will be given the option to have more time to do the test if they need so and the&#xD;
      CHWs will come back later to pick up the collecting tube. CHWs will explain the procedure&#xD;
      based on the communication material designed for that purpose. Women who decide to be&#xD;
      screened at health care centers will receive information about available timetables. The CHWs&#xD;
      will bring the self-taken sample to the health care center, where all collecting tubes will&#xD;
      be stocked to be sent to the provincial HPV laboratory, according to usual procedures and&#xD;
      delivery schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHWs will update the F883 template, the standard PHC form used by CHWs to collect&#xD;
      socio-demographic and health data of the household and its members. In addition to that, CHWs&#xD;
      will use a specific questionnaire to collect basic about inclusion/exclusion criteria,&#xD;
      self-testing acceptability and reasons for doing/not doing self-testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Conventional Sample group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the home visits that CHWs carry during health rounds, selected CHWs will visit every&#xD;
      household they are in charge of and will invite the eligible women to participate in the&#xD;
      study, providing them with the necessary information about the goals and activities involved.&#xD;
      Eligible women willing to participate in the study will be invited to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent. Next, they will be given an education talk promoting cervical screening. They will&#xD;
      be given information about HPV testing at health care centers as well as educational material&#xD;
      on the prevention of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CHWs will update the F883 template, the standard PHC form used by CHWs to collect&#xD;
      socio-demographic and health data of the household and its members. In addition to that, CHWs&#xD;
      will use a specific questionnaire to collect basic about inclusion/exclusion criteria,&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women from this group, upon visiting the health care center for the conventional test, will&#xD;
      be taken an HPV and Pap test at the same time, based on the provincial protocols and&#xD;
      regulation framework. Samples will be sent to be read at the Cytology and HPV Laboratory,&#xD;
      according to standard provincial mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2) Delivery of results, follow up and treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Self-test group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women tested HPV positive will receive the visit of the CHW to inform them of the result.&#xD;
      They will be invited to undergo diagnosis studies (colposcopy/biopsy) at their closest health&#xD;
      care center. The CHW will brief them on the availability of timetables, professionals and&#xD;
      health care centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those women with suspicious colposcopic images will have a targeted colposcopy-directed&#xD;
      biopsy taken, to be read by the provincial pathological anatomy laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with histologically confirmed precancerous lesions wil be followed up and treated based&#xD;
      on the protocols established on the Recommendations for screening, follow up and treatment of&#xD;
      women for the prevention of cervical cancer in the framework of the HPV test incorporation,&#xD;
      by the National Ministry of Health20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data about Pap tests, colposcopy, biopsy and treatments will be registered at SITAM&#xD;
      (screening information system), following the Provincial Program for Cervical Cancer&#xD;
      Prevention regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Conventional sample group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women tested HPV positive, with abnormal Pap test, will be visited by the CHW to inform them&#xD;
      of the result and invite them to undergo a colposcopy at their closest health care center.&#xD;
      The CHW will brief them on the availability of timetables, professionals and health care&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women tested HPV positive but with a normal Pap test, will receive the results based on the&#xD;
      usual procedures set forth by the Provincial Program for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those women with suspicious colposcopic images will have a targeted colposcopy-directed&#xD;
      biopsy taken, to be read by the provincial pathological anatomy laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women with a histologically confirmed precancerous lesion should be followed up and treated&#xD;
      based on the protocols set forth in the Recommendations for screening, follow up and&#xD;
      prevention of cervical cancer in the framework of the HPV test incorporation, by the National&#xD;
      Ministry of Health20.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data about Pap tests, colposcopy, biopsy and treatments will be registered in SITAM,&#xD;
      based on the Provincial Program for the Prevention of Cervical Cancer regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Training for CHWs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participating CHWs will be informed about the study and a special training will be&#xD;
      provided. During the training sessions, the goals of the study, the main activities to be&#xD;
      carried out and the specific tasks that each one of them will have to perform will be&#xD;
      explained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Production of communications material:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informative material will be prepared for CHWs participating in the study, the main goals of&#xD;
      the study will be explained in it and guidelines with the steps to follow during the home&#xD;
      visit will be provided to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, a special leaflet will be prepared with the self-test instructions to be delivered&#xD;
      to those women to whom that option is offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides, all contacted women will be given general leaflets on cervical cancer prevention and&#xD;
      the HPV Test and those women that did the self-test will be given a leaflet on the meaning of&#xD;
      HPV Test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Sample selection and size&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Proposed sample size for the coverage study&#xD;
&#xD;
           With the purpose of selecting CHWs participating in the study, a list of all the CHWs of&#xD;
           the province of Jujuy will be made (N = 678). Then they will be classified by gender and&#xD;
           type of health care center (urban or rural). The CHWs that over the year 2011 have been&#xD;
           rated of regular performance by the PHC system will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           150-200 CHWs will be randomly selected, in a sample proportional to the size of four&#xD;
           strata defined by gender and health care center type. The CHWs selected in every stratum&#xD;
           will be randomly allocated to each one of the study groups (half for the Self-test group&#xD;
           and half for the Conventional Sample group).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assuming that a CHW will enroll an average of 40 women (with a minimum target of 20&#xD;
           women) in the two visits of the round, the overall number of women enrolled in every&#xD;
           study group will approximately be at least 75 x 40 = 3.000 (number of CHWs x number of&#xD;
           women per CHW) with a total number of 6.000 women in the study. We assume that the&#xD;
           coefficient of intra-class correlation (CIC) is 0.05, 0.075 or 0.10 the power to detect&#xD;
           a 10% change (from 50% to 60%) in the first coverage indicator for a 5% level of&#xD;
           significance test is 0.999, 0.97 and 0.93 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Self-test acceptability estimate&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acceptability is defined as the percentage of women accepting doing the self-test&#xD;
           against the number of women offered the self-test or the conventional sample option.&#xD;
           Under the scenario described in the previous section the expected half-length of the 95%&#xD;
           confidence interval for acceptability within the population is 3.1%, 3.5% and 4.0% for a&#xD;
           CIC of 0.05, 0.075 and 0.1 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
           These values are dawned considering the worst situation regarding the length of the&#xD;
           confidence interval, which stems from assuming an acceptability of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Sample size for the CIN2+ detection rate comparison of the HPV Self-test versus cytology&#xD;
           as a primary screening method&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will compare the detection rate of histologically confirmed CIN2+ lesions diagnosed in&#xD;
      2011 within the framework of the provincial program for the prevention of cervical cancer,&#xD;
      based on cytology as primary screening method, against the HPV Self-test detection rate&#xD;
      (relative sensitivity). This analysis will include approximately 20.000 women of 30 years of&#xD;
      age and older screened with cytology during the year 2011, in the framework of the provincial&#xD;
      screening program, and the 3.000 women that are expected to be screened by means of the HPV&#xD;
      Self-test within the framework of the present research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cytology detection rate for the year 2011 in the province of Jujuy is of approximately&#xD;
      0.8%. If it is assumed that with the HPV Self-test the detection rate to be reached will be&#xD;
      of 1.4%, 1.6%, 1.8% or 2.0%, the power of the one-tailed test (5% level of significance) to&#xD;
      compare the CIN2+ detection rates turns out to be 0.895, 0.977, 0.966 and 0.999 respectively.&#xD;
      The power calculation was done assuming there is no impact produced by the CHW on the CIN2+&#xD;
      detection rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A database built specifically for the study will be used; it will include data about&#xD;
      randomization Group, agreement to participate in the study, basic socio-demographic data,&#xD;
      realization of self-test (in the corresponding group), and if appropriate, reasons for&#xD;
      doing/not doing the self-test. Finally, the HPV Test realization will be uploaded importing&#xD;
      the data from SITAM, linking data based on the Unique Identification Number (DNI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data entry will be done through specific software that will include range and inter-item&#xD;
      consistency checks. Entries out of the expected range will not be allowed. Data entry will be&#xD;
      done by 3 data enters, with re-entry of 20% of questionnaires for quality control. Data will&#xD;
      be stored in files (TXT, DBF, SQL) compatible with their analysis with statistical packages&#xD;
      (Stata).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data cleaning process will actively search for errors in a planned way. Data screening&#xD;
      will include searching for four types of oddities: outliers (including inconsistencies),&#xD;
      strange patterns in distributions, and unexpected analysis results. Screening methods will&#xD;
      include browsing of data tables after sorting, printouts of variables not passing consistency&#xD;
      checks, graphical exploration of distribution, frequency distributions and cross-tabulations&#xD;
      and summary statistics. Once errors have been identified, we will go to previous stages of&#xD;
      the data flow to see whether the value is consistently the same. If no error is found in the&#xD;
      data entry phase, we will question the interviewer about what may have happened. If possible,&#xD;
      we will contact the interviewee for repeated measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accuracy of previous HPV test reported by the woman will be crossed with information from the&#xD;
      laboratory database (SITAM). Those women having reported not having a previous HPV test, but&#xD;
      with a test in the SITAM data base will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project database will be also matched with the PHC database. For that purpose, the&#xD;
      records of women of 30 years of age and older residing in the areas included in the study&#xD;
      will be imported from the PHCS databases, including name, DNI and basic socio-demographic&#xD;
      data of the woman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data are exhaustive and complete for all samples arriving to the HPV laboratory. Because we&#xD;
      define the outcomes as number of tests effectively recorded in the laboratory database&#xD;
      (SITAM)/ number of women in the study arm, we do not expect to have missing data in the main&#xD;
      outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SITAM database is less complete regarding follow-up diagnosis procedures: colposcopy and&#xD;
      biopsies. In those cases where HPV+ women have missing data for colposcopy and/or biopsy&#xD;
      results, the project team will contact Navigators from the Provincial Program for Cervical&#xD;
      Cancer Prevention. Usual navigators´ role in the provincial Program is to contact women with&#xD;
      abnormal results that have had problems to complete diagnosis/treatment procedures to provide&#xD;
      them support so they can be able to finish the process. They can also contact health&#xD;
      professionals to verify information reported by women: for example, in cases where women&#xD;
      reported having been treated but no data is registered in SITAM. In that case, they contact&#xD;
      the health professional to verify treatment provided and its results. Information gathered by&#xD;
      navigators is entered in SITAM in a specific module which will be also used to complete data&#xD;
      for missing cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be done through specific commercial softwares (STATA 10.0 or SAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Self-test acceptability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acceptability is defined as the number of women accepting the self-test against the number of&#xD;
      women offered the option between the self-test and the conventional sample (proportion of&#xD;
      women accepting the self-test). Although all CHWs will receive the same instructions and&#xD;
      material, it is to be expected that there will be differences in the way the self-test is&#xD;
      offered, be it because they are more convinced about the relative advantages, or for their&#xD;
      gender condition, etc. The acceptability in this population will be estimated as the average&#xD;
      of acceptabilities calculated by CHW, as to control the impact of the CHWs on acceptability&#xD;
      and reach an appropriate variance estimate. Besides, the variability introduced by the CHWs&#xD;
      on acceptability will be studied and the results obtained by male and female CHWs will be&#xD;
      compared, as well as those obtained by the CHWs in rural and urban areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2 Self-test effectiveness to enhance participation of women in screening and diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a comparison of the percentage of women that did the HPV test in the Self-test&#xD;
      group and the Conventional sample group. Three different coverage indicators will be&#xD;
      considered for every CHW. These will be defined as the number of women screened within the&#xD;
      field work regarding:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The number of women reached by the CHW who accepted participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The number of eligible women for that CHW (regardless of whether the CHW was able to&#xD;
           contact them or not).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For every CHW we will measure the adherence to the indication of follow up diagnosis as well&#xD;
      as the number of women with colposcopy indication that underwent a colposcopy within the&#xD;
      follow-up period over the overall number of women with colposcopy indication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effect of the strategy (offering the self-test option against promotion of the&#xD;
      conventional sample) will be estimated for each one of the coverage measures using a means&#xD;
      difference test or a non-parametric test for independent samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.3 CIN 2+ detection rate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The effectiveness of the HPV Self-test against screening cytology to detect CIN2+ will be&#xD;
      estimated as the detection rates difference and as the detection rates ratio. Specific&#xD;
      estimates will be provided as well as intervals of confidence for both measures of&#xD;
      effectiveness and accurate or asymptotic tests will be performed as appropriate based on the&#xD;
      number of CIN2+ detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, there will be a comparison of the CIN2+ detection rate in the group of women who&#xD;
      did the self-test against the total number of women in the province of Jujuy that were tested&#xD;
      for HPV (conventional sample strategy + triage Pap test) until December 2012. The power of&#xD;
      the comparison for the difference observed will be informed upon reporting the results.&#xD;
