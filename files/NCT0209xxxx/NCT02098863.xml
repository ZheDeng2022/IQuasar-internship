  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the important work of previous sickle cell disease (SCD) cohort studies, there remain&#xD;
      many understudied areas that require investigation. An important knowledge deficit is the&#xD;
      slow but progressive process of chronic end-organ dysfunction. The majority of organ&#xD;
      dysfunction becomes apparent in the young adult years, but comprehensive assessment of adults&#xD;
      and understanding of predictors of adulthood organ dysfunction are insufficient. Similarly,&#xD;
      the role of disease-modifying therapies, such as hydroxyurea, in preventing organ dysfunction&#xD;
      later in life is not clear. Extended follow-up of patients through the transition into&#xD;
      adulthood is imperative to understand the long-term implications of pediatric sickle cell&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational study will collect data in a systematic fashion at participants' regular&#xD;
      clinic visits (in-person or remote) to answer the objectives described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to primary study objectives, SCCRIP participants will be eligible to participate&#xD;
      in a sub-study, which will investigate genetically determined responses to Hydroxyurea (HU)&#xD;
      via a pharmacokinetic study (PK). This one time study will involve blood collection at timed&#xD;
      intervals proceeding a dose of HU. Defining the basis for this inter-individual variability&#xD;
      will allow the identification of poor HU responders prior to initiation of therapy and the&#xD;
      seeking of alternative treatments which seek to optimize disease treatment by accounting for&#xD;
      individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyle.&#xD;

      The St. Jude Pediatric SCD Program has developed a comprehensive plan of care that spans the&#xD;
      ages of 0 to 25, and provides the structure for screening and monitoring disease progression&#xD;
      and complications in infancy, childhood, and young adulthood. From age 0 to 18, SCD patients&#xD;
      are followed at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. At age 18, their care is typically&#xD;
      transferred to either the Methodist Adult Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease Center in&#xD;
      Memphis, TN, or the Regional One Health, Diggs-Kraus Sickle Cell Center in Memphis, TN, where&#xD;
      they are routinely followed from age 18 to 25 years. After age 25, participants will be&#xD;
      followed and invited to return to St. Jude every 6 years for study related tests until&#xD;
      participants elect to come off study or until death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, the Methodist Adult Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease&#xD;
      Center and the Regional One Health Diggs-Kraus Sickle Cell Center, in Memphis, TN serve as&#xD;
      enrolling centers for the SCCRIP protocol.Three St. Jude Affiliate locations will also be&#xD;
      sites of enrollment for this protocol for patients age 0 to 18 years. These include St. Jude&#xD;
      Affiliate sites located in: Baton Rouge, Louisiana; Peoria, Illinois; and Charlotte, North&#xD;
      Carolina. Approximately 500 additional participants are expected to be enrolled from these&#xD;
      affiliate sites. This protocol will collect data on SCD participants from birth to end of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SCD plan of care provides the specific sequence of laboratory and imaging studies that&#xD;
      are performed according to the patient's age and expected course of illness. The following&#xD;
      health outcomes are systematically monitored in patients with SCD: hematologic indices,&#xD;
      pulmonary function, cardiac function, renal function, cognitive function, cerebral&#xD;
      vasculopathy, vitamin D deficiency and bone health, parvovirus B19 immune status,&#xD;
      ophthalmologic status, and splenic function. These tests are used to direct the patient's&#xD;
      clinical management and initiate therapies when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who reach 20 (± approximately 1 year) years of age and are enrolled on SCCRIP&#xD;
      Amendment 6.0 or above, may participate in a neuropsychological screening. The screening will&#xD;
      include a series of verbal and nonverbal problem-solving activities, pencil &amp; paper tasks,&#xD;
      and will include a computerized component.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality of Life evaluations (Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (PedsQL™) will be offered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the results of these tests will be collected and entered into the study&#xD;
      database, providing longitudinal data that will inform health outcomes research regarding SCD&#xD;
      and how the course is altered by disease-modifying therapy, in addition to facilitating&#xD;
      future interventional projects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To establish a longitudinal clinical cohort of patients with sickle cell disease (SCD)&#xD;
           to serve as a research resource to facilitate evaluation of health outcomes in SCD from&#xD;
           pediatric care into adulthood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To facilitate the collection of biological samples from patients with SCD to be used in&#xD;
           future studies investigating genetic and epigenetic contributions to disease severity,&#xD;
           response to treatment, and morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the incidence, prevalence, and severity of SCD complications and adverse&#xD;
           health conditions within the SCD cohort during five stages of development and adulthood:&#xD;
           the newborn period (birth to 5.9 months), the infant/pre-school stage (ages 6 months to&#xD;
           5.9 years), the early school stage (ages 6 to 11.9 years), the adolescent stage (ages 12&#xD;
           to 17.9 years), young adulthood (ages 18 to 24.9 years) and mature adulthood (ages 25&#xD;
           and above).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify and evaluate risk factors for premature mortality and long-term morbidity in&#xD;
           patients with SCD, including those related to disease-modifying therapies, end-organ&#xD;
           damage, genetics, neurocognitive deficits, psychosocial factors, and behavioral causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the long-term effects of hydroxyurea and other therapies on preservation&#xD;
           of organ function, growth and development, and frequency and severity of disease&#xD;
           complications, and their long-term medical, neurocognitive, and psychosocial toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the functional aspects of the Transition to Adult Care Program within a&#xD;
           clinical research cohort by evaluating disease specific health literacy and readiness in&#xD;
           relation to healthcare utilization during adult care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore the long-term alterations of prolonged antibiotic exposure on the microbial&#xD;
           community composition among people living with SCD through the collection of swabs as&#xD;
           guided by the Human Microbiome Project (HMP) Manual of Procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Pre-Specified Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Define the drug-exposure to clinical response relationship of HU therapy in children&#xD;
           with SCD.&#xD;
