      The purpose of this study is to determine whether J-shaped thoracophrenolaparotomy is&#xD;
      effective in the surgical treatment of simultaneous liver and right lung metastases from&#xD;
      colorectal cancer&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Right-sided lung metastases are resected synchronously with liver metastases by means of a&#xD;
      thoracophrenolaparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-operative staging includes for all patients colonoscopy, thoracic and abdominal&#xD;
      contrast enhanced computed tomography (CT), contrast enhanced magnetic resonance (MRI) of the&#xD;
      upper abdomen, and 18-fluorodeoxyglucose PET scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory examinations including liver function tests, spirometry, cardiologic and&#xD;
      anesthesiological evaluation are also performed in alla patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Procedures The patient is placed in supine position with the arms extended&#xD;
      laterally. The anaesthesiologist for selective lung insufflation positions the double lumen&#xD;
      endotracheal tube. The J-shaped abdominal incision conventionally adopted for liver surgery&#xD;
      is performed. In case of tumors involving segment 1 or cranial segment portion of segments 4&#xD;
      superior, 7 and 8 close to the caval confluence, the incision is prolonged along the 9th&#xD;
      right intercostal space allowing the access to thoracic cavity. The incision of the skin and&#xD;
      the external oblique muscle reaches the anterior axillary line. A small portion, about 2&#xD;
      centimetres, of the cartilaginous costal arch is removed, and then the diaphragm is divided&#xD;
      in a radial direction. The inner parietal incision, involving parietal pleura and intercostal&#xD;
      muscles is prolonged up to the posterior axillary line preserving the intercostal&#xD;
      neurovascular bundle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraoperative ultrasound (IOUS) is performed in all patients to stage the liver involvement&#xD;
      as well as to assess the relation between tumors and vascular structures and guidance in the&#xD;
      dissection of hepatic parenchyma. If nodules are isoechoic in comparison to the surrounding&#xD;
      tissue, the staging is completed with contrast-enhanced IOUS (CEIOUS); the contrast agent&#xD;
      consists of 4.8 mL of microbubbles filled with sulfur hexafluoride (SonoVueÂ®; Bracco Imaging,&#xD;
      Italy), which is injected intravenously.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once surgical strategy is defined, the liver mobilization is completed by dividing the right&#xD;
      and/or left triangular and coronary ligaments as needed. For combining the abdominal and&#xD;
      thoracic procedures the right liver has to be mobilized at least up to the exposure of the&#xD;
      inferior vena cava allowing larger radial incision of the diaphragm and enlarged view field&#xD;
      to the thoracic cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At first the thoracic surgeon performs the pulmonary part. The bed is tilted to the left side&#xD;
      and exposure of right thoracic cavity is gained to the entire lung and the lateral&#xD;
      mediastinum. With deflation and gentle retraction of the ipsilateral lung, the mediastinum&#xD;
      and pericardium are exposed. Pulmonary ligament and lobar fissures are divided as needed.&#xD;
      Manual palpation of the lung to detect the metastatic lesion is carried out. Then, wedge&#xD;
      resection of the lung metastases is performed by using disposable stapler. Allowing the lung&#xD;
      to collapse facilitates application of the stapling device and achievement of an adequate&#xD;
      margin. Absorbable monofilament sutures are used, if necessary, to ensure haemostasis and/or&#xD;
      small air leaks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hepatic resection is then started. Briefly, definition of the resection area with the&#xD;
      main purpose of surrounding the tumor at its deepest portion combining the minimal&#xD;
      parenchymal sacrifice and the flattest cut surface is performed under IOUS guidance. The&#xD;
      hilar pedicle is then encircled with a tourniquet if dissection is not intended. Otherwise,&#xD;
      in case of major hepatectomy, hilar dissection is performed. For all patients, parenchymal&#xD;
      transection is obtained under intermittent clamping by Pringle maneuver continued for 15&#xD;
      minutes followed by 5 minutes of reperfusion without preconditioning. After 4 clamping&#xD;
      cycles, reperfusion time is prolonged for 10 minutes. Liver dissection is accomplished using&#xD;
      crush clamping technique, ligating with sutures all the vessels but those thinner which are&#xD;
      coagulated using bipolar electrocautery . Before abdominal closure, the cut surface of the&#xD;
      liver is sealed with haemostatic agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Closed suction abdominal drains are inserted in every patient around the liver, in variable&#xD;
      number depending to the number and the size of liver cut surfaces. They are removed on the&#xD;
      7th postoperative day (POD) if the bilirubin level in the drain discharge sampled routinely&#xD;
      on the 3rd, 5th, and 7th POD showed a decrement, and in any case was below 10 mg/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One or two chest tube are placed in the pleural cavity, being removed from the 3rd POD, in&#xD;
      absence of air leak within the bottle and if the serous output is below 200 mL/24h.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ribs are approximated with pericostal sutures using braided absorbable sutures size 2.&#xD;
      The diaphragm is closed with a single layer running suture. Peritoneum and fasciae of the&#xD;
      chest and abdominal wall are closed in an anatomic pattern. Subcutaneous layer and skin are&#xD;
      finally closed in the routine manner.&#xD;
