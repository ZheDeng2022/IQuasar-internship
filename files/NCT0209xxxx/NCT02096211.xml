  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is intended to gather short (Pre-operative to 4-years) and mid-term (5-years)&#xD;
      information regarding the performance and safety of the commercially available 36mm CERAMAX®&#xD;
      Ceramic on Ceramic Total Hip System from a cohort of new study subjects that were not&#xD;
      previously involved in the IDE study for this device.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Up to 10 (up to 5 original IDE + 5 new sites)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, non-controlled, non-randomized, multicenter study. Subjects will be seen for a&#xD;
      clinic visit pre-operatively at the time of consent, (-90 days to surgery) and then at&#xD;
      post-operatively at 6 weeks (1-92 days), 1 year (275-455 days), 2 years (640-820 days) and 3&#xD;
      years (1005-1185days), 4 years (1370-1550 days), and a minimum of 5 years (1825- 2555 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected will include: Pre-operatively subject history and demographics; Operative and&#xD;
      device details; and Post-operatively Harris HIp scores, Subject Hip Outcomes, and Adverse&#xD;
      Events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to optimize mid-term follow-up compliance, site personnel are permitted to contact&#xD;
      the study subject in the 3 and 4 year intervals by phone (in place of a clinic visit) to&#xD;
      assess the current status of the hip.&#xD;

    <measure>Subject Hip Outcomes (Clinic)</measure>
    <time_frame>Subject Hip Outcomes will be estimated at 6-Wks (1-92 days); 1-year (275-455 days); 2-years (640-820 days); 3-years (1005-1185 days); 4-years (1370-1550 days); Minimum 5-years (1825- 2555 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Subject Hip Outcomes (Clinic) will be estimated at each year post-operatively. Subject Hip Outcomes is a standardized instrument for use as a measure of health outcome that is designed for completion by the study subject. This hips outcomes self-assessment includes five (5) questions about subject satisfaction and hip function. The 5 questions subject's will answer regard their function, pain, need for pain meds, satisfaction and status (i.e., better, same, worse).&#xD;
The percent of subjects who answer 'Yes' or 'Better' on each respective question will be reported.</description>

    <description>High quality antero-posterior and lateral radiographs of the operative hip will be obtained during the same intervals as for the clinical evaluations. At the first post-operative visit (6-Weeks), an additional Cross-Table Lateral film will be collected to permit assessment of the cup positioning.&#xD;
Radiographic views:&#xD;
AP&#xD;
AP femur view is required only when the distal end of the femur is not visible on the AP-Pelvis view)&#xD;
Lateral&#xD;
Cross-Table Lateral (Only at 6-Week post-op)&#xD;
As a single composite radiographic outcome, the percent of subjects with radiolucencies greater than 2 mm, acetabular cup migration greater than 4 mm, change in cup inclination greater than 4 degrees or osteolysis at the time of last radiographic assessment will be reported.</description>
