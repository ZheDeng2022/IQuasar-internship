      The purpose of this study is evaluate the efficacy and safety of eltrombopag as a rescue of&#xD;
      isolated chemotherapy-induced thrombocytopenia in patients with solid tumor .&#xD;

    <textblock>
      For the phase III study, a double-blind randomized, placebo controlled, parallel-group design&#xD;
      will be conducted to evaluate the efficacy of eltombopag . Each subject will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to either Arm A (eltombopag) or Arm B (placebo) in 2:1 ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to compare the response rates of the two treatment arms, Therefore,&#xD;
      the two-proportion z test will be considered and sample size can be chosen to achieve an 95%&#xD;
      power for detecting a clinically meaningful difference at level of significance=0.05. A&#xD;
      difference of 40% in clinical response is considered of clinically meaningful difference&#xD;
      between the two treatment arms (75% for eltombopag vs. 35% for placebo). It requires a total&#xD;
      sample of 83 subjects (55 for eltombopag and 28 for placebo). According to the 10% loss of&#xD;
      screening failure, 90-100 subjects (60-67 for eltombopag and 30-33 for placebo) will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
