      The purpose of this research study is to develop a method of using magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) to evaluate solitary pulmonary nodules (mass in the lung smaller than 3 centimeters). A&#xD;
      pulmonary nodule is a mass or growth on the lung. An MRI is a scanning device that uses&#xD;
      magnets to make images (pictures) of the body. This study is being done to determine what&#xD;
      series of reactions (metabolic pathways) pulmonary nodules use as they burn sugar as fuel for&#xD;
      growth. The manner in which the tumor burns (metabolizes) sugar for fuel is being&#xD;
      investigated by using a natural, slightly modified, sugar solution (13C-glucose) and studying&#xD;
      a small sample of the tumor once it is removed at the time of surgery.&#xD;

      The recent report of the findings of the National Lung Screening Trial indicates that&#xD;
      screening a high-risk population using low dose CT results in a 20% reduction in lung cancer&#xD;
      mortality. At our institution, some of positive nodules that are 1 cm or larger would be&#xD;
      imaged using combined fluoro-deoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG PET)/CT. Highly&#xD;
      suspicious nodules would be biopsied if the risks were manageable. Otherwise, the suspicious&#xD;
      nodules not eligible for biopsy and so-called &quot;indeterminate&quot; nodules are followed using CT&#xD;
      to be evaluated for interval growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this project is to assess several very promising imaging biomarkers that&#xD;
      can reflect either the physiological or metabolic status of these nodules in order to develop&#xD;
      more accurate imaging algorithms for follow-up that are either less invasive or do not use&#xD;
      ionizing radiation or both. Based on our experience with other cancers and our preliminary&#xD;
      results in lung cancer, we have identified four potential imaging studies that we believe&#xD;
      have the potential to result in validated &quot;imaging biomarkers&quot; that can either individually,&#xD;
      or in combination, characterize malignancies. Since tumors tend to exhibit angiogenesis and&#xD;
      altered vascular permeability, we and others, have found that analyses of dynamic contrast&#xD;
      enhanced MRI (DCEMRI) can be employed as &quot;imaging biomarkers&quot; for malignancy. Tumors often&#xD;
      exhibit higher cellularity than benign or normal tissue suggesting that pixel-by-pixel ADC&#xD;
      values derived from diffusion weighted MRI could be useful imaging biomarkers. Finally,&#xD;
      measuring alterations in metabolic fluxes through the use of pathway specific C-13 labeled&#xD;
      compounds, a technique pioneered here at the Advanced Imaging Research Center (AIRC) at UT&#xD;
      Southwestern, has shown the capability of providing metabolic fingerprints for malignant and&#xD;
      benign tissue. This approach, while invasive, could identify and validate markers that can be&#xD;
      detected non-invasively in future studies. We will also employ advanced metabolomics methods&#xD;
      to identify potential signature &quot;onco-metabolites&quot; in these lung cancers.&#xD;
