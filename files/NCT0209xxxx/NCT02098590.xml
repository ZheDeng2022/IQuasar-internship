  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malaria, a disease caused by the parasite Plasmodium, is one of the world's major infectious&#xD;
      diseases. With approximately 627.000 deaths a year, it is both a chief cause of morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality as well as a significant contribution to ongoing poverty in endemic countries.&#xD;
      Ultimately, the key to malaria control, and hopefully eradication, would be an effective&#xD;
      vaccine. Though a number of vaccine-candidates have entered the pipeline of pre-clinical and&#xD;
      clinical development, they have yet to achieve the level of efficacy necessary for effective&#xD;
      malaria prevention. It has been shown previously that if healthy human volunteers taking&#xD;
      chloroquine chemoprophylaxis are repeatedly exposed to Plasmodium parasites through the bites&#xD;
      of infected mosquitoes, they are fully protected against a later challenge infection with a&#xD;
      'homologous' (genetically similar) Plasmodium parasite. This process is known as&#xD;
      ChemoProphylaxis and Sporozoites, or CPS-immunization. One of the obstacles to developing an&#xD;
      effective vaccine is the genetic heterogeneity of malaria parasites. To further consider the&#xD;
      development of whole-parasite based vaccines against malaria and in order to better&#xD;
      understand the protective immunity induced by CPS-immunization, it is essential to&#xD;
      investigate whether heterologous protection against genetically diverse (heterologous) P.&#xD;
      falciparum clones can be induced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, randomized, double-blind study to determine whether healthy&#xD;
      volunteers immunized with P. falciparum NF54 parasites under chloroquine prophylaxis are&#xD;
      protected against a challenge infection with the genetically distinct NF135.C10 or NF166.C8&#xD;
      P. falciparum clones.&#xD;
