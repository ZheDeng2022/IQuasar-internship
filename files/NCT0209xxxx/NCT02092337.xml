      Computer-assisted speech training is a speech recognition training system developed for&#xD;
      cochlear implant users. With minimal facilities and skills, cochlear implant users can&#xD;
      conduct this training at home. The purpose of this study was to apply this system to&#xD;
      adolescent and young adult hearing aid users with prelingual severe to profound hearing loss.&#xD;

      Introduction Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) is a disability affecting people worldwide,&#xD;
      and the prevalence is expected to increase due to prolonged life expectancy. SNHL has a&#xD;
      significant negative impact on the quality of life, especially in prelingually deafened&#xD;
      children. Except for certain diseases such as sudden deafness or endolymphatic hydrops, which&#xD;
      may be treated or alleviated by medication or surgery, most patients with SNHL have to wear&#xD;
      hearing aids or undergo cochlear implantation to regain hearing. However, for many&#xD;
      individuals these measures do not satisfactorily resolve communication problems, because&#xD;
      hearing is only the first step in a series of events leading to communication. Between&#xD;
      hearing and communication lie the important skills of listening and comprehension, and to&#xD;
      achieve successful communication it has been suggested that patients receiving amplification&#xD;
      should be offered some type of audiological rehabilitation. It has been reported that older&#xD;
      subjects do not spontaneously acclimatize to wearing a hearing aid, or that the effects are&#xD;
      either small or nonexistent, which emphasizes the importance of rehabilitation after wearing&#xD;
      a hearing aid. Unfortunately, not everyone with SNHL in Taiwan receives this kind of&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The reasons for this may be: (a) methods of rehabilitation are not familiar&#xD;
      to all clinicians or speech pathologists; (b) there is a shortage of clinicians or speech&#xD;
      pathologists to provide such time-consuming rehabilitation; (c) hearing impaired patients may&#xD;
      be unable to afford or are unwilling to dedicate time to rehabilitation; and (d) it is&#xD;
      difficult to measure the improvements provided by rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, rehabilitative training procedures have been garnering interest due to&#xD;
      technological advances enabling a hearing aid user to perform the procedures while at home&#xD;
      using a personal computer. Burk et al trained young normal-hearing and older hearing-impaired&#xD;
      listeners with digitally recorded training materials using a computer. The results showed&#xD;
      that older hearing-impaired listeners were able to significantly improve their&#xD;
      word-recognition abilities through training with one talker, and to some degree achieve the&#xD;
      same level as young normal-hearing listeners. In addition, the improved performance was&#xD;
      maintained across talkers and across time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The computer-aided speechreading training (CAST) system was developed to simulate a&#xD;
      face-to-face training intervention and was designed to be one component of a comprehensive&#xD;
      aural rehabilitation program for preretirement adults with acquired mild-to-moderate hearing&#xD;
      loss. The aim of the training was to enhance speechreading skills to complement auditory&#xD;
      speech perception. Throughout the training, the learner views a monitor that shows either a&#xD;
      computer-generated screen or a videotaped recording of the teacher. CAST was designed to be&#xD;
      used by a clinician to extend rather than to replace existing rehabilitative techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Computer-based training has also been applied to the rehabilitation of cochlear implant&#xD;
      users. Before the development of computer-based training, some studies assessed the effects&#xD;
      of limited training on the speech-recognition skills of poorer-performing cochlear implant&#xD;
      users. Busby et al conducted ten 1-hour speech perception and production training sessions,&#xD;
      and the results demonstrated minimal changes in perceptual abilities in three cochlear&#xD;
      implant users. Dawson and Clark conducted one 50-minute training session per week for 10&#xD;
      weeks, and four of five subjects showed some measure of improvement. The limited success of&#xD;
      these attempts to improve the speech-recognition abilities of cochlear implant users was&#xD;
      thought to be due to an inadequate amount of training. More intensive training of cochlear&#xD;
      implant users was predicted to be effective, because in normal hearing populations training&#xD;
      has been shown to successfully improve speech segment discrimination and identification, and&#xD;
      recognition on spectrally shifted speech. Fu et al reported encouraging results in the&#xD;
      rehabilitation of cochlear implant users using a computer-assisted speech training system&#xD;
      which they also called CAST, although this was different to the CAST system of Pichora-Fuller&#xD;
      and Benguerel. The CAST system of Fu et al, developed at the House Ear Institute, contains a&#xD;
      large database of training materials and can be installed on personal computers, and so with&#xD;
      minimal facilities and skills, cochlear implant users can conduct the training at home, and&#xD;
      clinicians or speech pathologists can monitor the subject's test score and training progress.&#xD;
      The results demonstrated that after moderate amounts of training (1 hour per day, 5 days per&#xD;
      week), all 10 postlingually deafened adult cochlear implant users in the study had&#xD;
      significant improvements in vowel and consonant-recognition scores. Wu et al applied the CAST&#xD;
      system to 10 Mandarin-speaking children (three hearing aid users and seven cochlear implant&#xD;
      users). After training for half an hour a day, 5 days a week, for a period of 10 weeks, the&#xD;
      subjects showed significant improvements in vowel, consonant and Chinese tone performance.&#xD;
      This improved performance was largely retained for 2 months after the training had been&#xD;
      completed. Stacey and Summerfield also used computer-based auditory training to improve the&#xD;
      perception of noise. The results confirmed that the training helped to overcome the effects&#xD;
      of spectral distortions in speech, and the training materials were most effective when&#xD;
      several talkers were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these previous studies, cochlear implant users can improve their speech recognition&#xD;
      ability after training with a CAST system. If this system is also effective for hearing aid&#xD;
      users, and especially prelingually deafened patients, the CAST system will have a&#xD;
      substantially positive impact, as there are many more hearing aid users than cochlear implant&#xD;
      users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study was to train prelingually deafened adolescents and young adults&#xD;
      with CAST and measure the benefits objectively and subjectively. The objective benefits were&#xD;
      measured using published speech recognition tests [13], and the subjective benefits were&#xD;
      measured using client-oriented scale of improvement (COSI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods Subjects Fifteen hearing aid users with prelingual severe to profound&#xD;
      hearing loss participated in this study. Another six hearing aid users with a similar age and&#xD;
      hearing average were included as the control group. The inclusion criteria for the study&#xD;
      subjects and controls were: (1) age above 15 years; (2) wearing a hearing aid for at least&#xD;
      for 2 years after hearing loss was diagnosed; (3) basic ability to operate a computer; (4)&#xD;
      Mandarin Chinese speaker; and (5) motivation to undertake the training program. The exclusion&#xD;
      criteria were: (1) aided hearing average worse than 70 dBHL; (2) unable to operate a&#xD;
      computer. Before training with CAST, all participants received unaided and aided sound field&#xD;
      audiometry. Table 1 shows the basic information of the 21 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Client-oriented scale of improvement (COSI) We use a COSI questionnaire to evaluate&#xD;
      subjective benefits. Before training with the CAST system, both the training and control&#xD;
      groups were asked to identify up five specific situations in which they would like to cope&#xD;
      better. At the end of the training, for each situation they were asked (A) how much better&#xD;
      (or worse) they could now hear, and (B) how well they were now able to cope. For scaling&#xD;
      purposes, the responses were assigned scores from 1 to 5, with 5 corresponding to &quot;much&#xD;
      better&quot; and &quot;almost always&quot;, 4 corresponding to &quot;better&quot; and &quot;most of the time&quot;, 3&#xD;
      corresponding to &quot;slightly better&quot; and &quot;half the time&quot;, 2 corresponding to &quot;no difference&quot;&#xD;
      and &quot;occasionally&quot;, and 1 corresponding to &quot;worse&quot; and &quot;hardly ever&quot;, for questions A and B,&#xD;
      respectively. Question A was defined as an &quot;improvement&quot;, and question B was defined as&#xD;
      &quot;final ability&quot;. The total scores of the five situations were compared between the training&#xD;
      and control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test materials and procedures The speech recognition test materials including monosyllabic&#xD;
      words, disyllabic spondee words, vowels, consonants and Chinese tone recognition tests were&#xD;
      recorded onto a CD-ROM at Melody Medical Instruments Corp. by a male and female speaker. The&#xD;
      test materials were displayed on a laptop computer connected to a GSI 61TM clinical&#xD;
      audiometer (Grason-Stadler, USA) at an output level of 70 dBHL. The testing procedure was&#xD;
      performed in a double-walled, sound-treated room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monosyllabic Chinese word recognition test materials included four blocks of 25 Chinese&#xD;
      words. For each speech recognition test, 50 words were selected resulting in a set of 50&#xD;
      tokens. After a monosyllabic Chinese word was displayed, the participants were asked to write&#xD;
      down the word. Four different sets of open-set tests were generated for each speech&#xD;
      recognition test. Disyllabic Chinese spondee-word recognition test materials included two&#xD;
      blocks of Chinese spondee-words, each block containing 36 Chinese spondee-words. For each&#xD;
      speech recognition test, one block was selected resulting in a set of 36 tokens. After a&#xD;
      Chinese spondee-word was displayed, the participants were asked to write down the word. Four&#xD;
      different sets of open-set test were generated via changing the order of the materials for&#xD;
      each speech recognition test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vowel recognition test materials included 16 Chinese words. Vowel recognition was measured&#xD;
      using a 4-alternative, forced-choice procedure in which Chinese characters were shown on the&#xD;
      choice list. For each speech recognition test, the order of the words was changed. Thus, four&#xD;
      different sets of closed-set tests were generated. Consonant recognition test materials&#xD;
      included 21 Chinese words. Consonant recognition was measured using a 4-alternative,&#xD;
      forced-choice procedure in which a Chinese character was shown on the choice list. For each&#xD;
      speech recognition test, the order of the words was changed, and thus four different sets of&#xD;
      closed-set tests were generated. Chinese tone recognition test materials included 50 Mandarin&#xD;
      Chinese words. The participants were asked to write down the Chinese tone (tone: 1: flat; 2:&#xD;
      rising; 3: falling-rising; 4: falling) after the Chinese word was displayed. For each speech&#xD;
      recognition test, the order of the words was changed, and thus four different sets of&#xD;
      open-set tests were generated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before training, both groups underwent a series of speech recognition tests as baseline data.&#xD;
      The training group then started training whereas the control group did not receive any&#xD;
      training. Every 4 weeks, the participants returned to the lab for another series of speech&#xD;
      recognition tests using different test materials. Every participant had received a total of&#xD;
      four speech recognition tests by the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training tools and procedures CAST software developed at the House Ear Institute and&#xD;
      distributed by Melody Medical Instrument Corp. was used as the training tool. The training&#xD;
      group was instructed to train at home following the program for at least 1 hour per day, 3&#xD;
      days a week, for 12 successive weeks. The control group did not receive any training and&#xD;
      returned to the lab every 4 weeks for speech recognition tests. For each participant in the&#xD;
      training group, a baseline speech recognition test was performed after the software had been&#xD;
      installed into his or her personal computer. The results were analyzed by the software which&#xD;
      then automatically generated a targeted training program. The software contained a large&#xD;
      amount of information including pure tone, vowel recognition, consonant recognition, tone&#xD;
      recognition, speaker recognition, environmental sounds, occasional words and occasional&#xD;
      sentences. The subjects were asked to focus on pure tone, vowel recognition, consonant&#xD;
      recognition and tone recognition training. The subjects started the training at a level&#xD;
      generated by the computer software. There were usually five levels of difficulty in each&#xD;
      training category, and each level consisted of several training sessions. For pure tone&#xD;
      recognition training, the subjects were asked to choose the sound different to the others.&#xD;
      Visual feedback was provided as to whether the response was correct or incorrect. After a&#xD;
      training session had been completed, the score was calculated. If the score exceeded 80, the&#xD;
      training proceeded to a higher level. If the score did not exceed 80, the training session&#xD;
      was repeated until the score exceeded 80. At a higher level of training sessions, the&#xD;
      differences between speech features in the response choices were reduced. For vowel&#xD;
      recognition training, the subjects were asked to choose the vowel different to the others.&#xD;
      After the subjects had progressed beyond the 3-alternative forced-choice discrimination task,&#xD;
      they were trained to identify final vowels. Similar training procedures were used for&#xD;
      consonant and tone recognition training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject in the training group was asked to register on the Melody Medical Instrument&#xD;
      Corp. website, and his or her username and password were provided to us. Therefore, we were&#xD;
      able to monitor the total time spent training, and the training time and score for each&#xD;
      exercise. If the subjects did not reach the required amount of time and training sessions, we&#xD;
      contacted their family and encouraged them to do more training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods All statistical analyses were performed with SAS software (Version 9.1.3,&#xD;
      SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, U.S.A.) and R software (Version 2.7). Two-sided p values of&#xD;
      0.05 or less were considered to be statistically significant. Continuous data were expressed&#xD;
      as mean ± standard deviation (SD) unless otherwise specified. Percentages were calculated for&#xD;
      categorical variables. Two-sample t tests or Wilcoxon rank-sum tests were used to compare the&#xD;
      means or medians of continuous data between two groups, whereas the chi-squared test or&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test was used to analyze categorical proportions between two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to univariate analyses, the data of the five speech recognition tests were&#xD;
      analyzed by fitting multiple marginal linear regression models using generalized estimating&#xD;
      equations. If the first-order autocorrelation (i.e., AR(1)) structure fit the repeated&#xD;
      measures data well, the model-based standard error estimates were used in the generalized&#xD;
      estimating equations analysis; otherwise, the empirical standard error estimates were&#xD;
      reported. In addition, the data of COSI were analyzed by fitting multiple linear regression&#xD;
      models.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic model-fitting techniques for variable selection, goodness-of-fit assessment, and&#xD;
      regression diagnostics were used in our regression analyses to ensure the quality of the&#xD;
      results. In stepwise variable selection, all of the univariate significant and&#xD;
      non-significant covariates were considered, and both the significance levels for entry and&#xD;
      for stay were set to 0.15 or larger. The goodness-of-fit measure, the coefficient of&#xD;
      determination (R2), was computed for all of the linear regression models, which is the square&#xD;
      of the correlation between the observed response variable and the predicted value. It had a&#xD;
      value between 0 and 1, with a larger value indicating a better fit of the multiple linear&#xD;
      regression model to the observed continuous data. In addition, the variance inflation factor&#xD;
      was examined to detect potential multicollinearity problems (defined as a value ≥ 10).&#xD;
