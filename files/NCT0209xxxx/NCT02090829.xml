      : The objective of this study is to determine the tolerability and therapeutic potential of&#xD;
      oxytocin in children and adolescents with Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD) when paired with a&#xD;
      computer game intervention that is designed to enhance face perception skills. We designate&#xD;
      two measures as our primary outcomes, based on prior published work with these interventions,&#xD;
      and we propose a sample based on power analyses from these prior results. A second objective&#xD;
      of this study is to learn about the breadth of possible positive effects that this&#xD;
      combination therapy might have for children with ASD. To this end, we include a host of other&#xD;
      exploratory measures that assess aspects of social motivation and attention, social&#xD;
      perception, and social cognition. Thus, a second objective is to conduct a &quot;signal finding&quot;&#xD;
      study - to gather outcome data on a range of dependent variables that theoretically should be&#xD;
      related to oxytocin's effects on social processes, but for which there are no prior data. The&#xD;
      signal finding aspect of this study will provide the preliminary data needed to design a more&#xD;
      targeted follow up study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin in 52 children and&#xD;
      adolescents with ASD. Diagnosis will be confirmed using Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#xD;
      (DSM) criteria, supported by the Autism Diagnostic Interview and the Autism Diagnostic&#xD;
      Observation Schedule. Subjects will be randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo for&#xD;
      a 5 day period with concomitant game play of the FaceStation computer games, developed at&#xD;
      CHOP. Measures of social function and cognition will be administered before and after the&#xD;
      game play period. Two measures of social functioning will serve as our primary endpoints; all&#xD;
      other measures will be treated as exploratory variables, with significance testing corrected&#xD;
      for multiple comparisons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recognizing faces is critical to social functioning, and can be improved for individuals with&#xD;
      ASD by using intervention software in the form of appropriately designed computer games. The&#xD;
      effects of this type of social intervention may be amplified with the concurrent use of&#xD;
      oxytocin. Furthermore, these learning effects may impact social skills in general and&#xD;
      translate to the level of the individual's everyday social behavior. Thus, the objective of&#xD;
      this study is to determine the safety and therapeutic potential of intranasal oxytocin in&#xD;
      children and adolescents with ASD when paired with a computer game intervention that is&#xD;
      designed to enhance face perception skills.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline to Post-testing on the The Part/Whole Identity Test</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline/Follow-up post testing (max 12 days)</time_frame>
    <description>4) Part/Whole Identity Test measures the extent to which the participant employed a featural or holistic face recognition strategy. In this task, a sample face is presented for 4 sec, followed by a test face composed of either two whole faces or two face parts. As expected in Part/Whole Identity, effect sizes ranged from a low 0.30 for the part mouth condition to a high of 0.81 for the whole eye condition, such that the condition measuring holistic processing in the eye region was most sensitive to group differences. This measure was also most sensitive to behavioral changes with the LFI intervention trial.</description>

    <description>Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (child version) (Baron-Cohen, et al., 2001) is a test of emotion recognition. This test asks children to pick the best word out of four options to describe the mental state of a set of eyes. The test includes 28 photographs of eyes with both affective (e.g., upset) and cognitive (e.g., thoughtful) mental state words as choices.</description>

Route of administration: Intranasal Planned exposure: Each participant will receive one dose of intranasal oxytocin (24 IU) per day for 5 days.&#xD;
One dose of 24 IU equals 6 spray puffs (3 puffs in each nostril). Oxytocin will be imported from Victoria Pharmacy Zurich- Switzerland.</description>
