      The OSMITTER study protocol was designed as a master protocol governing multiple substudies&#xD;
      for the rapid assessment of candidate subcomponents for the MIND1 System. This substudy was&#xD;
      conducted to determine the accuracy of IEM detection by the MIND1 System by completing a&#xD;
      series of Patch applications and IEM ingestions in the clinic.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Accuracy of Ingestible Event Marker (IEM) Detection</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to Hour 6 on Day 1</time_frame>
    <description>The accuracy of IEM signal detection was collected by comparing the time of ingestion recorded by MIND1 system at different timepoints with the time recorded by the clinic staff. The percentage of participants with the accurate time of IEM detection are reported for each ingestion separately at Hours 0, 2, 4 and 6 on Day 1.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Latency Period From Ingestion to Detection of IEM</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 at Hours 0, 2, 4, 6</time_frame>
    <description>Latency period was defined as the time in minutes from the IEM ingestion for both aripiprazole and placebo to the time of detection of IEM by MIND1 system on a smartphone. The latency period is calculated as the difference in the time recorded by the clinic staff of IEM ingestion and the time displayed on the MIND1 application.</description>

    <description>Participants were placed a patch by the clinical staff prior to each ingestible event marker (IEM) tablet ingestion. Participants received one IEM tablet approximately every 2 hours, for a total of 4 ingestions on Day 1 at 0, 2, 4 and 6 hours.&#xD;
Following placement of the patch by clinic staff, participants ingested one 10 mg aripiprazole-embedded IEM tablet without food at Hour 0, one placebo-embedded IEM tablet without food at approximately Hour 2, one placebo-embedded IEM tablet with a high fat meal at approximately Hour 4, and one placebo-embedded IEM tablet without food at approximately Hour 6. Clinic staff recorded the time of each ingestion of an IEM and the time detected by MIND1 System.</description>

        <description>The accuracy of IEM signal detection was collected by comparing the time of ingestion recorded by MIND1 system at different timepoints with the time recorded by the clinic staff. The percentage of participants with the accurate time of IEM detection are reported for each ingestion separately at Hours 0, 2, 4 and 6 on Day 1.</description>
