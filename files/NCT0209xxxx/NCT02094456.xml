      Diverticular bleeding is the most common cause of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
      (LGIB) in Western populations. Although self-limited in 85% of cases, some patients may&#xD;
      require hospitalization with blood transfusion and emergent intervention, with significant&#xD;
      associated morbidity and mortality. Up to 25% of patients with an initial bleeding episode&#xD;
      will have subsequent episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diverticula form at weak points along the colon wall, where the vasa recta enter the circular&#xD;
      muscle layer of the colon. Diverticular bleeding is attributed to thinning of the blood&#xD;
      vessels as they cross over the dome of a diverticulum. Endoscopic clipping of actively&#xD;
      bleeding colonic diverticula has been recognized as a safe and effective treatment for acute&#xD;
      LGIB since the mid1990s. Patients selected would have had previous colonoscopy to exclude&#xD;
      other causes of bleeding (e.g. angiodysplasia, colorectal cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose prophylactic elective endoscopic diverticular clipping in patients&#xD;
      who have had at least 1 episode of acute LGIB requiring hospitalization. This would involve&#xD;
      applying endoscopic clips to the base of every diverticula in a patient's colon, such that&#xD;
      any bleeding source would effectively be excluded. The investigators would later reevaluate&#xD;
      patients for colonoscopic appearance of diverticula to assess their diverticular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that patients undergoing endoscopic diverticular clipping will&#xD;
      not have repeat episodes of bleeding.&#xD;

      1.0 BACKGROUND AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to prophylactically clip all colonic diverticula in patients who have&#xD;
      experienced at least 1 episode of diverticular bleeding requiring hospitalization, but&#xD;
      without definitive procedure (i.e., total colectomy or localization with embolization or&#xD;
      clipping). The investigators' objective is to prevent future episodes of colonic bleeding&#xD;
      from the diverticula, so as to avoid morbidity and possible mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that those patients undergoing secondary prophylaxis through&#xD;
      diverticular clipping will experience no further episodes of diverticular bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 OBJECTIVES AND PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diverticular bleeding is the most common cause of acute lower gastrointestinal bleeding&#xD;
      (LGIB) in Western populations. Although self-limited in 85% of cases, some patients may&#xD;
      require hospitalization with blood transfusion and emergent intervention, with significant&#xD;
      associated morbidity and mortality. Up to 25% of patients with an initial bleeding episode&#xD;
      will have subsequent episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diverticula form at weak points along the colon wall, where the vasa recta enter the circular&#xD;
      muscle layer of the colon. Diverticular bleeding is attributed to thinning of the blood&#xD;
      vessels as they cross over the dome of a diverticulum. Endoscopic clipping of actively&#xD;
      bleeding colonic diverticula has been recognized as a safe and effective treatment for acute&#xD;
      LGIB since the mid-1990s. Patients selected would have had previous colonoscopy to exclude&#xD;
      other causes of bleeding (e.g. angiodysplasia, colorectal cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose prophylactic elective endoscopic diverticular clipping in patients&#xD;
      who have had at least 1 episode of acute LGIB requiring hospitalization. This would involve&#xD;
      applying endoscopic clips to the base of every diverticula in a patient's colon, such that&#xD;
      any bleeding source would effectively be excluded. The investigators would later re-evaluate&#xD;
      patients for colonoscopic appearance of diverticula, as there is some suggestion that&#xD;
      diverticula may resolve after such management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective feasibility study of outpatients who have previously&#xD;
      been hospitalized with at least one episode of diverticular bleeding. Diverticular disease&#xD;
      will have been confirmed by previous colonoscopy to assess the extent of diverticular&#xD;
      disease. Consecutive patients at follow-up outpatient appointments will be approached with a&#xD;
      Patient Information Sheet. On follow-up appointment they will be recruited and enrolled for&#xD;
      endoscopic clipping of colonic diverticula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure itself will be similar to a screening colonoscopy. As outpatients, patients&#xD;
      will take bowel preparation. Colonoscopy will occur with sedation only, including fentanyl&#xD;
      and midazolam per protocol. Individual colonic diverticula will be clipped to exclude the&#xD;
      bleeding source.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four (24) patients will be enrolled for diverticular clipping. These patients will be&#xD;
      followed prospectively for 2 years for repeat bleeding episodes. Follow-up will consist of&#xD;
      telephone calls every 6 months by the study team. In addition, patients will be scheduled for&#xD;
      repeat colonoscopy to assess their diverticular disease 6 months after clipping of colonic&#xD;
      diverticula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 SELECTION AND WITHDRAWAL OF SUBJECTS Currently, patients admitted with complications of&#xD;
      diverticular disease are seen in Diverticular Disease clinic for follow-up. Consecutive&#xD;
      patients will be selected from this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may withdrawal from the study at any time, including during the colonoscopy with&#xD;
      clipping of diverticula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 DATA COLLECTION AND MONITORING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will take place on a specially created case report form (See case report form&#xD;
      version 1.2). Case report forms will be stored in a locked office in the Department of&#xD;
      Colorectal Surgery accessible only to the study team. Data will be entered into an excel&#xD;
      spreadsheet. The spreadsheet will be kept on a password protected NHS desktop in a locked&#xD;
      office in the Department of Colorectal Surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a feasibility study, recruited patients will be study prospectively. Any analysis&#xD;
      will include all patients enrolled. There will be no control group or randomization at this&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
