    <textblock>
      Prostate cancer is the most commonly diagnosed form of cancer in Canadian men. In 2006,&#xD;
      greater than 250,000 men were diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States and Canada&#xD;
      with more than 32,000 men dying of their disease. Using the prognostic variables of&#xD;
      T-category, the serum prostate specific antigen (PSA), and the pathologic Gleason score (GS),&#xD;
      men with localized prostate cancer are placed in low, intermediate and high-risk groupings.&#xD;
      Usually this is treated with surgery, radiation therapy, hormone therapy and/or watchful&#xD;
      waiting (also known as active surveillance). While these treatments are quite effective,&#xD;
      tumours are likely to recur in about 40% of cases. There is a need for additional prostate&#xD;
      cancer treatments. To address this need, many experimental therapies are being developed and&#xD;
      tested in mice with prostate tumors. This includes the study of aggressive prostate cancer&#xD;
      cells such as stem cells, or Tumour Initiating Cells (TICs), or oxygen deprived cells, which&#xD;
      may be the ones most likely to re-grow into a tumour or spread throughout the body.&#xD;
      Researchers want to try and isolate these special cells from the prostate after surgery to&#xD;
      study their features, and to see if they can re-grow as solid tumours in mice. Researchers&#xD;
      would like to test whether the prostate cancer stem cells are more resistant or less&#xD;
      resistant to treatments. This will allow researchers to study and test new treatments that&#xD;
      specifically target resistant and aggressive prostate cancer cells. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that marker-defined TIC cells or hypoxic cancer cells have unique genetics in&#xD;
      primary prostate cancers and are relatively chemo- and radio-resistant.&#xD;
