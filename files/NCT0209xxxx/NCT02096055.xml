  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized phase II trial studies how well guadecitabine with or without idarubicin or&#xD;
      cladribine works in treating older patients with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
      Guadecitabine may stop the growth of cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for&#xD;
      cell growth. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as idarubicin and cladribine, work in different&#xD;
      ways to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from&#xD;
      dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. It is not yet known whether guadecitabine with&#xD;
      or without idarubicin or cladribine is more effective in treating older patients with&#xD;
      previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the complete remission (CR) rate, remission duration, leukemia-free survival,&#xD;
      and survival in patients &gt;= 70 years with previously untreated acute myeloid leukemia (AML)&#xD;
      with 4 different guadecitabine (SGI-110) single agent and SGI-110 based combination regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine the safety profile and tolerability of the 4 SGI-110 single agent and&#xD;
      SGI-110 based combination regimens in patients &gt;= 70 years of age with previously untreated&#xD;
      AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive guadecitabine subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-5. Courses&#xD;
      repeat every 4-6 weeks for 2-3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity. Patients achieving a CR or CR with incomplete platelet recovery (CRp) continue on&#xD;
      to Maintenance therapy; patients not achieving CR or complete remission with incomplete&#xD;
      hematologic recovery (CRi) but deriving clinical benefit may continue to Maintenance therapy&#xD;
      at the discretion of the Principal Investigator (PI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive guadecitabine as in Induction therapy. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 4-8 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II (CLOSED):&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive guadecitabine SC on days 1-10. Courses repeat every 4-6&#xD;
      weeks for 2-3 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
      Patients achieving a CR or CRp continue on to Maintenance therapy; patients not achieving CR&#xD;
      or CRi but deriving clinical benefit may continue to Maintenance therapy at the discretion of&#xD;
      the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive guadecitabine SC on days 1-5 (days 1-10 of courses 1&#xD;
      and 2). Courses repeat every 4-8 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM III:&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive guadecitabine SC on days 1-5 and idarubicin intravenously&#xD;
      (IV) over up to 1 hour on days 1-2. Courses repeat every 4-6 weeks for 2-3 courses in the&#xD;
      absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a CR or CRp&#xD;
      continue on to Maintenance therapy; patients not achieving CR or CRi but deriving clinical&#xD;
      benefit may continue to Maintenance therapy at the discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive guadecitabine SC on days 1-5 and idarubicin IV over up&#xD;
      to 1 hour on day 1. Courses repeat every 4-8 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of&#xD;
      disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM IV (CLOSED):&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY: Patients receive guadecitabine SC and cladribine IV over up to 1 hour on&#xD;
      days 1-5. Courses repeat every 4-6 weeks for 2-3 courses in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving a CR or CRp continue on to&#xD;
      Maintenance therapy; patients not achieving CR or CRi but deriving clinical benefit may&#xD;
      continue to Maintenance therapy at the discretion of the PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE THERAPY: Patients receive guadecitabine SC and cladribine IV over up to 1 hour on&#xD;
      days 1-5. Courses repeat every 4-8 weeks for up to 24 months in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every month.&#xD;
