      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of intravitreal aflibercept&#xD;
      injection (IAI) in patients with neovascular polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, non-randomized, unmasked, study of IAI in patients with choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularization secondary to polypoidal choroidal vasculopathy (PCV). Twenty treatment&#xD;
      naïve and previously treated PCV eyes will be enrolled (only one study eye per patient will&#xD;
      be enrolled). A maximum of 10 previously treated eyes will be enrolled. Consented, enrolled&#xD;
      patients will be followed monthly. All patients will receive monthly IAI 2.0 mg&#xD;
      intravitreally for 3 months (Baseline, Months 1 and 2), followed by mandatory IAI 2.0 mg&#xD;
      every 2 months (Months 4, 6, 8 and 10) for 12 months. Patients can receive additional IAI&#xD;
      treatment (Months 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) if the re-treatment criteria are met. Starting at Month&#xD;
      3, patients can receive non-anti vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) rescue therapy&#xD;
      (ie: Photodynamic Therapy (PDT), laser, intravitreal steroids) if the pre-defined criteria&#xD;
      are met.&#xD;
