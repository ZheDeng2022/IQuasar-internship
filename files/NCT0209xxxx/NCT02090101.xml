  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The metastatic colon cancer is a major public health problem despite advances in&#xD;
      chemotherapy; few new drugs are in development for the treatment of this pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown that human colon cancer is a tumor that is recognized by the immune&#xD;
      system and the presence of lymphocytic infiltrates in the tumor bed is associated with a&#xD;
      better prognosis. Conversely, the effect of chemotherapy on the immune response is little&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently the importance of myeloid suppressor cells (MDSC) in the development of colon cancer&#xD;
      and the effect of 5- fluorouracil on this cell population has been highlighted. An&#xD;
      accumulation of these cells in the blood and lymphoid organs during tumor progression is&#xD;
      observed. Moreover, it has been established that the death of MDSC induced by 5-fluorouracil&#xD;
      induces activation of caspase -1 and IL-1beta by these MDSC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These events promote the polarization of CD4 T cells in intratumoral Th17 lymphocytes. The&#xD;
      IL- 17 produced by these cells exerts a pro-angiogenic effect in inducing proliferation of&#xD;
      endothelial cells expressing and thus limits the effect of 5- fluorouracil endoglin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In humans, it has also been observed that chemotherapy using 5- fluorouracil and in&#xD;
      particular LV5FU2 association +/- bevacizumab induces rapid death of blood MDSC as well as&#xD;
      activation of caspase 1 in these cells. Thus, production of IL - 1 is detected in the serum&#xD;
      of patients after 24 hours of the administration of 5-fluorouracil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic inflammation and the production of interleukin- 1 can alter the effectiveness of anti&#xD;
      -tumor immune responses and facilitate angiogenesis. Many preclinical data suggest a role of&#xD;
      anti -tumor inhibition of IL- 1beta, but the effect of a combination of chemotherapy and an&#xD;
      inhibitor of IL - 1beta has not yet been tested in human.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anakinra is a drug used in humans for many years to treat signs and symptoms of rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. In combination with methotrexate, in patients whose response to methotrexate alone&#xD;
      is not satisfactory it had shown interesting results. The dose used clinically is 100 mg per&#xD;
      day which is the dose that is proposed to be tested in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context it should be remembered that methotrexate is a chemotherapeutic agent from&#xD;
      the class of antimetabolites such as 5- fluorouracil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RCP of this drug indicate that in studies originator toxicity was similar between the control&#xD;
      arm and anakinra arm with an increase in serious infections (1.8 % vs 0.7 %) and an increased&#xD;
      incidence of neutropenia (2.5 % neutropenia &gt; grade = 1). The main toxicity observed is a&#xD;
      painful inflammatory reaction at the injection site in 70 % of patients The investigators&#xD;
      believe that this project could permit to validate in man preclinical observations showing an&#xD;
      anti-tumor potential for combination anakinra and 5 fluorouracil.&#xD;
