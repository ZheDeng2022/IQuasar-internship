  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The electrocardiogram (ECG) is an important diagnostic procedure in medicine mainly to detect&#xD;
      circulation disorders and problems of the spread of the electrical heart impulse. It is&#xD;
      frequently the first measure in clinical practice when angina pectoris, acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction or an arrhythmia are suspected. The ECG is easy to perform, safe and cheap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posture changes are known to cause alterations of the ECG [1]. Deviation of the electrical&#xD;
      heart axis (EHA) [2], temporary changes of the QRS morphology and ST-segment alterations are&#xD;
      of particular importance in view of diagnostic accuracy [3], [4]. In ambulatory ECG&#xD;
      recordings ST-segment alterations for instance might mistakenly be interpreted as cardiac&#xD;
      ischemia [5]. Artifacts could be minimized by the concurrent determination of the deviation&#xD;
      of the electrical heart axis [6] [7]or by using posture detectors [8] helping to correlate&#xD;
      ECG changes to posture changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the emergence of new computer based opportunities ambulatory ECG in the sense of home&#xD;
      monitoring is an emerging market. Together with the superiority compared to the scalar ECG in&#xD;
      detecting certain pathologies, like myocardial infarction and right ventricular hypertrophy,&#xD;
      the VCG gained new interest in recent years [9]. Four ECG leads are sufficient to synthesize&#xD;
      a standard 12-lead ECG from a VCG and vice versa with a transformation matrix [10] [11].The&#xD;
      redirection of the spatial VCG after posture changes has been determined for the QRS loop&#xD;
      with the Frank leads, which is the reference method for constructing the VCG [12][13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      4 leads of an ambulatory ECG are sufficient to construct the VCG if arranged approximately in&#xD;
      the position of three rectangular axes. Doctors are best trained to interpret standard 12&#xD;
      lead ECGs. With optimization of the leads of ambulatory (Holter) ECG towards the three&#xD;
      rectangular axes, this might allow mathematical transformation into the standard 12 lead ECG.&#xD;
      A precondition would be that the transformation matrix is independent of posture. To date,&#xD;
      transformation matrix between Frank VCG and standard 12 lead ECG has only been calculated in&#xD;
      resting ECGs [5].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is the first study which investigates the transformation matrix in different postures.&#xD;
      Additionally, the investigators will investigate for the first time prospectively for known&#xD;
      artefacts of stress testing and ambulatory ECGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simultaneous prospective recording of the standard 12 lead ECG and the Frank-lead VCG in&#xD;
      different postures is expected to add information on potential causes of artifacts of the ECG&#xD;
      caused by posture changes. During continuous recording, the investigators will investigate&#xD;
      the accuracy of the linear affine transformation with posture, the occurrence (dimension and&#xD;
      duration) of ECG/ VCG morphology changes and ST-segment alterations, and VCG angle changes in&#xD;
      dependence of posture changes in healthy young men.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis The investigators hypothesis is that the transformation matrix between Frank-Lead&#xD;
      VCG and standard 12-lead ECG is posture dependent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Artefacts of the ECG due to posture changes are systematic. The knowledge of the systematics&#xD;
      improves the diagnostic accuracy of ambulatory ECG and stress testing.&#xD;
