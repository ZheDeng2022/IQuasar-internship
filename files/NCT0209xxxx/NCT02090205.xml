      Background There is no unanimous opinion about a lung-protective strategy in cardiac surgery.&#xD;
      Small randomized clinical and animals trials suggest that ventilation during cardio-pulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (CPB) could be protective on the lungs. This evidence is based on surrogate end-points&#xD;
      and most of studies are limited to elective coronary surgery. According to the available&#xD;
      data, an optimal strategy of lung protection during CPB cannot be recommended. The purpose of&#xD;
      the CPBVENT study is to investigate the effectiveness of different ventilation strategies&#xD;
      during CPB on post-operative pulmonary complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design The CPBVENT study will be a single-blind, multicenter, randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. We are going to enroll 780 patients undergoing elective cardiac surgery with planned&#xD;
      use of CPB, aortic cross-clamping and two lung ventilation. Patients will be randomized into&#xD;
      three treatment groups: 1) no ventilation during CPB; 2) continuous positive airway pressure&#xD;
      (CPAP) with positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP) of 5 cmH2O during CPB; 3) ventilation&#xD;
      with 5 acts/minute with tidal volume of 2-3 ml/Kg and a PEEP of 3-5 cmH2O during CPB. The&#xD;
      primary end-point will be the incidence of a PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;200 until the time of discharge&#xD;
      from the ICU. The secondary end-points will be the incidence of post-operative pulmonary&#xD;
      complications and 30-days mortality. Patients will be followed-up to 12 months after the date&#xD;
      of randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary The CPBVENT Trial will determine whether different ventilation strategies during CPB&#xD;
      will improve pulmonary outcome in patients undergoing cardiac surgery.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Respiratory failure (RF) is a common complication in cardiac surgery, with a&#xD;
      global incidence of 20-25% . Its clinical manifestation ranges from a mild form of&#xD;
      respiratory failure up to an acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) requiring prolonged&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation (MV) and intensive care unit (ICU) stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathophysiologic mechanism of RF is quite complex, but it is known that cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      bypass (CPB) plays a main role in determining lung injury. A number of factors contribute to&#xD;
      this injury: atelectasis, hyper-oxygenation causing the release of free radicals and&#xD;
      CPB-related systemic inflammatory response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's a common practice to suspend ventilation during CPB, since lung function is carried out&#xD;
      by an extracorporeal gas-exchanger. Moreover the absence of lung movements clearly&#xD;
      facilitates surgery. However, the interruption of MV during CPB is associated with the&#xD;
      development of micro-atelectasis, hydrostatic pulmonary edema, reduced lung compliance and&#xD;
      surfactant diffusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent observational study has identified the duration of CPB as an important risk factor&#xD;
      for the development of microbiologically-documented pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During last years' several preventive lung protective strategies have been investigated and&#xD;
      proposed: ultrafiltration to remove neutrophils, controlled hemodilution (with hematocrit&#xD;
      higher than 23%), steroids and MV settings during CPB, such as the application of a Positive&#xD;
      End-Expiratory Pressure (PEEP) or a Continuous Positive Airway Pressure (CPAP) 5-15 of cmH2O,&#xD;
      low tidal-high frequency ventilation (100 acts-per-minute), application of 100% oxygen&#xD;
      inspired fraction (FiO2), and bilateral CPB, which involves lungs for blood-oxygenation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent meta-analysis based on sixteen clinical trials found an increase in oxygenation and&#xD;
      a reduction in shunt fraction immediately after the weaning from CPB if CPAP was applied&#xD;
      during CPB. Similar results were obtained with a lung recruitment maneuver at the end of CPB.&#xD;
      Furthermore, maintaining MV during the whole duration of extracorporeal circulation would&#xD;
      reduce the CPB-related inflammatory response and tissue damage. Unfortunately, although&#xD;
      adequately planned, studies are not powered enough to recommend maintaining MV during CPB as&#xD;
      an evidence-based strategy to prevent respiratory complications, because major indicators of&#xD;
      clinical outcome (i.e., duration of postoperative MV, length of ICU and hospital stay, and&#xD;
      long-term follow-up) have not been investigated. Therefore, according to the available data&#xD;
      in literature, an unquestionable standardized strategy of lung protection during CPB cannot&#xD;
      be recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives We designed a randomized controlled trial to investigate the effects of three&#xD;
      different ventilator strategies in the short, medium and long term. We are testing the&#xD;
      hypothesis that MV during CPB would reduce lung damage, defined as the incidence of RF&#xD;
      (PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200) and post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs). See Appendix 1 for&#xD;
      complete definition of PPCs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS Trial design The CPBVENT study is a non-pharmacological, multi-center, single-blind,&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been registered on ClinicalTrials.gov with the registration number NCT02090205&#xD;
      and was endorsed by the Study Group on Cardiothoracic and Vascular Anesthesia of the SIAARTI&#xD;
      (the Italian Society of Anesthesia and Intensive Care Medicine).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants After Ethics Committee approval, we are going to enroll patients aged 18 or over&#xD;
      undergoing elective cardiac surgery with planned use of CPB, aortic cross-clamping, median&#xD;
      sternotomy and two lung ventilation. All patients will provide written informed consent&#xD;
      before their inclusion in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-points The primary end-point will be the reduction of incidence of PaO2/FiO2 ratio &lt;200&#xD;
      until the discharge from the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary end-points will be the evaluation of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  readmission to the ICU for RF,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  need for re-intubation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  need for noninvasive ventilation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  length of the ICU and hospital stay,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cardiovascular complications,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  short-term and long-term mortality,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  post-operative infections,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-Operative Residual Curarization (PORC): measured with a Train Of Four (TOF) and&#xD;
           defined as need for pharmacological reversal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions (Randomization and treatment protocol) The randomization list was created by&#xD;
      the coordinating center with a dedicated software and was stratified per center, in a 1:1:1&#xD;
      ratio, in blocks of 30. Once the patient releases informed consent, the investigator will log&#xD;
      in on a dedicated on line portal and he will obtain the allocation arm. From that moment it&#xD;
      will be impossible to remove the patient's record card from the online platform and, in any&#xD;
      case, the patient will be analyzed according to the intention-to-treat principle. Any&#xD;
      deviation from the ventilation protocol, together with reason for deviation, will be recorded&#xD;
      on the CRF. All the patients will be kept blind to the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly assigned to receive one of the following ventilator strategies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  First arm. No mechanical ventilation during CPB: patient will be disconnected from the&#xD;
           respiratory circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second arm. Patients will receive CPAP with PEEP of 5 mmH2O and FiO2 &lt; 80%. To perform&#xD;
           CPAP the ventilator will be set in manual/spontaneous mode, with a flow of 1-2 L/min and&#xD;
           the adjustable pressure valve (APL) set at 5 cmH2O. The actual pressure will be checked&#xD;
           with a pressure gauge integrated in the ventilator and a pressure gauge connected to the&#xD;
           proximal end of the endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Third arm. Patient will be ventilated with a respiratory rate of 5 per minute, with&#xD;
           tidal volume (TV) of 2-3 mL/Kg of Ideal Body Weight (IBW) and PEEP of 3-5 cm H2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before and after CPB patients will receive a lung-protective ventilator strategy, with an&#xD;
      Intermittent Positive Pressure Ventilation (IPPV) mode along with the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tidal Volume (TV) = 6-8 ml/kg of IBW:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PEEP = 5 cmH2O&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  FiO2 &lt;80%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I:E = 1:2 (inspiration:expiration ratio). During CPB our goal will be to maintain a PaO2&#xD;
           between 200 and 250 mmHg, in order to avoid hyperoxia-induced lung injury; moreover the&#xD;
           hematocrit will be maintained above 24%. During weaning from CPB we will perform a&#xD;
           single alveolar recruitment maneuver, with an airway pressure of 40 cmH2O maintained at&#xD;
           least for 7 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative ventilation The anesthesiologist will report in the Case Report Form (CRF) the&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation setting used during the transfer of the patient from the operating&#xD;
      theater to ICU. In ICU we will apply an IPPV with the same parameters used in the operating&#xD;
      room. Blood oxygen saturation will be constantly monitored with a pulseoxymeter. We will&#xD;
      report the extubation-time, the duration of mechanical ventilation and the need of&#xD;
      re-intubation. Blood gas analyses will be performed by the clinician according with clinical&#xD;
      needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection Investigators will collect all the data on the dedicated CRF and will insert&#xD;
      all the information required in the online platform. The coordinator center will directly&#xD;
      receive all the information in a very simple data flow, with safe mechanisms for the&#xD;
      protection of personal clinical information. The website uses an https format and all&#xD;
      patients' data will be collected anonymously. We have also implemented regular backups, in&#xD;
      order to minimize the risk of data corruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge from the hospital, patients will be phone-called for the follow-up. We will&#xD;
      record any re-admission in hospital or exitus. Follow-up will be performed 30 days, 60 days&#xD;
      and one year after randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations Sample size Sample-size calculation was based on a two-sided alpha&#xD;
      error of 0.05 and a 80% power. On the basis of respiratory insufficiency incidence after&#xD;
      cardiac surgery we anticipate a 25% of patients with a PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 200 ratio. We expect the&#xD;
      incidence of this parameter to be reduced of the 35%. We calculate that we will need a sample&#xD;
      size of 263 patients per group. Including a drop-out fraction of 10%, we calculate that we&#xD;
      will be needing 870patients to complete the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis We will analyze patients in the treatment group to which they are allocated.&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed with a professional statistical software. Data will be analyzed&#xD;
      according to the intention-to-treat principle and following a pre-established analysis plan.&#xD;
      Dichotomous variables will be compared with the two-tailed Χ2 test, using the Yates&#xD;
      correction when appropriate. Continuous variables will be compared by analysis of variance or&#xD;
      the non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis test, when appropriate. Relative risks with 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals and differences between medians with 95% confidence intervals (using the&#xD;
      Hodges-Lehmann estimation) will be calculated when appropriate. Two-sided significance tests&#xD;
      will be used throughout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgroup analyses We will infer a subgroup effect if the interaction term of treatment and&#xD;
      subgroup is statistically significant at P &lt;0.05.&#xD;
