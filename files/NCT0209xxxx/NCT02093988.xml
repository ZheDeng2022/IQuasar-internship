      Our study will evaluate the use of topical and intravenous (IV) Tranexamic Acid (TXA) in&#xD;
      spine surgery. The purpose of TXA is to prevent clotting during surgery to reduce blood loss.&#xD;
      When used intravenously, it has been shown to safe, efficacious, and effective in reducing&#xD;
      transfusion requirements and blood loss in spine surgeries. We want to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      using TXA topically and intravenously to see if it further reduces blood loss in children&#xD;
      undergoing major surgery compared to IV TXA only&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Blood loss during major paediatric spine surgery is significant, and it is well established&#xD;
      that patients undergoing such surgery have a substantial risk for requiring a blood&#xD;
      transfusion in the perioperative period (1-4). Given the cost and associated risks with&#xD;
      allogeneic blood product transfusion (5-7), a significant effort has been directed towards&#xD;
      reducing transfusion requirements through various methods of blood conservation (8-12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a synthetic antifibrinolytic that functions through competitive&#xD;
      blockade of the lysine-binding sites of plasminogen, plasmin, and tissue plasminogen&#xD;
      activator resulting in the inhibition of fibrinolysis and clot degradation (13). When used&#xD;
      parentally, it has been shown to safe, efficacious, and effective in reducing transfusion&#xD;
      requirements and blood loss during the perioperative period of various orthopaedic&#xD;
      procedures, including major surgeries of the spine (14-23). A growing body of literature has&#xD;
      supported the topical application of TXA in lower extremity joint reconstruction, among other&#xD;
      procedures (24-29), in which a saline solution containing TXA is placed directly in the&#xD;
      surgical incision prior to closure. Two randomized controlled trials have compared topical&#xD;
      TXA and placebo for use in lumbar fusion and laminectomy cases. Both of these trials&#xD;
      demonstrated a significant reduction in perioperative blood loss with the use of topical TXA&#xD;
      as compared to placebo, and no reported no adverse events (36, 37).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While intravenous TXA has proven efficacy in reducing perioperative blood loss, despite its&#xD;
      routine use during major paediatric spine surgery, blood loss and transfusion requirements&#xD;
      remain significant (14-23). Thus, methods to further reduce perioperative blood loss in the&#xD;
      children are of clinical significance. As highlighted above, topical TXA has clearly&#xD;
      demonstrated excellent local anti-fibrinolytic action. Furthermore, when applied within a&#xD;
      surgical incision, there is a negligible increase in serum TXA concentration (33-35).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We therefore propose a randomized trial to evaluate the effect of topical TXA on&#xD;
      perioperative blood loss when used in addition to intravenous TXA for major paediatric spine&#xD;
      surgery. In doing so, we seek to evaluate whether additional benefit may be conferred through&#xD;
      direct application of TXA within the incision intravenous to that already provided by IV TXA.&#xD;
      To date, such a question has not been evaluated in the surgical literature.&#xD;
