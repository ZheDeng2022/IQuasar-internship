    <textblock>
      To determine the efficacy and safety of hyaluronic acid (AdantTM, Tedec-Meiji Farma SA) for&#xD;
      acute ankle sprain, a single-site, open-label, controlled trial will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in a sport-medicine clinical research center in London, Ontario,&#xD;
      Canada. The eligible patients will be 18 years of age and older, have first or second degree&#xD;
      lateral sprain within 48h of the start of the treatment, and moderate or severe pain (&gt;45mm&#xD;
      on 100 mm pain visual analogue scale /VAS). Exclusion criteria will include bilateral ankle&#xD;
      sprain, ipsilateral knee trauma, prior sprain in the past 6 months, use of NSAID prior to&#xD;
      entry, intra-articular ankle injection in the prior 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will receive standard care (RICE and rescue analgesics), and a single 2.5cc&#xD;
      Adant periarticular ankle injection following provision of informed consent and collection of&#xD;
      baseline data. NSAIDs, corticosteroids or topical analgesics will not be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be done at baseline, days 8, 30 and day 90. Efficacy measures will include&#xD;
      patient's pain VAS on weight bearing (0-100mm) and walking 20m (0-100mm), patients' global&#xD;
      assessment of ankle injury (5 point categorical scale), patients' assessment of normal&#xD;
      function/activity (5 point categorical scale), physician's global assessment of ankle injury&#xD;
      (5 point categorical scale), patients/physician satisfaction assessment (10 point categorical&#xD;
      scale), time to return to pain-free and disability-free sport and adverse events as per WHO&#xD;
      definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that the Hyaluronic acid injections will decrease pain and swelling, promote&#xD;
      healing, improve time to return to sport and increase mobility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankle sprains are among the most common of all sports injuries, with approximately two&#xD;
      million people per year seeking medical treatment (1, 2, 3). An epidemiological study of&#xD;
      professional, competitive, and recreational athletes found a prevalence of ankle sprain as&#xD;
      high as 73% (4). Data from the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey: 2000&#xD;
      Emergency Department (ED) Summary listed about 1.375 million ED visits in the US due to ankle&#xD;
      sprains which represent about 1.3% of ED visits (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle sprains most commonly affect the lateral ligament complex. The lateral ligament complex&#xD;
      of the ankle consists of three separate ligaments: anterior talofibular, posterior&#xD;
      talofibular and calcaneofibular. The anterior talofibular ligament is usually the ligament&#xD;
      affected although in more severe injuries the calcaneofibular ligament may also be involved.&#xD;
      Varus or inversion sprains include a spectrum of severity. Symptoms may include pain,&#xD;
      swelling, tenderness and functional loss. Ankle sprains are classified as first-, second- or&#xD;
      third-degree ankle sprains. A first-degree sprain represents a partial tear of a ligament&#xD;
      with mild tenderness and swelling, a second-degree sprain represents incomplete tear of a&#xD;
      ligament with moderate functional impairment, pain and swelling, and a third-degree sprain&#xD;
      represents a complete tear and loss of integrity of a ligament and presents with severe&#xD;
      swelling, ecchymosis, loss of function and mechanical instability (6, 7). The assessment and&#xD;
      treatment of an ankle injury may be performed by emergency and primary health care physicians&#xD;
      as well as orthopaedic and trauma surgeons (8).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The emphasis of therapy in ankle sprains is centered on reducing the inflammation and pain&#xD;
      rapidly following injury (7, 9). Guidelines for the treatment of acute ankle sprain from the&#xD;
      American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons recommend initial rehabilitation program (up to&#xD;
      three weeks) with NSAIDs (non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs), RICE (rest, ice,&#xD;
      compression and elevation) as well as protected weight bearing, early mobilization and&#xD;
      isometrics (10). Conservative treatment may limit disability to an average of 8 days for a&#xD;
      grade 1 and 15 days for a grade 2 (3). Failure to provide adequate therapy can limit a&#xD;
      patient's efforts in rehabilitation and prolong the recovery period. In a study of ankle&#xD;
      sprain, pain and dysfunction was found to persist 6 to 18 months (average 12.8 months) after&#xD;
      initial ankle sprain in 73% of patients, with 40% reporting inability to walk one mile, and&#xD;
      11% continuing to use medications for ankle symptoms (11). In a long-term follow-up study,&#xD;
      nearly 40% of patients reported residual long-term symptoms and dysfunction 6.5 years after&#xD;
      initial ankle sprain (12). Also, long-term symptoms of ankle sprain have been noted by 40% of&#xD;
      athletes 6 months after acute injury (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      NSAIDs effectively reduce the inflammation, pain, and disability associated with acute ankle&#xD;
      sprain (13, 14). The rationale for their use includes 1) pain control, 2) anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      effect to allow early activity and 3) decrease inflammation to speed healing directly.&#xD;
      However, NSAIDs are nonselective and may cause significant adverse events including UGI&#xD;
      intolerance and serious events such as ulcers and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyaluronic Acid is a naturally occurring biological substance which has shown to have a&#xD;
      positive effect in viscosupplementation therapy. As it relieves pain and stiffness related to&#xD;
      osteoarthritis, it may have a similar effect on the ligaments affected by acute ankle sprain&#xD;
      in regards to anti-inflammatory effects. This would promote the mobility and decrease the&#xD;
      pain associated with acute ankle sprains. Hyaluronic Acid has no effect on UGI and platelet&#xD;
      function compared to traditional NSAIDs as it works locally within the site of injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies conducted on joints affected by osteoarthritis have shown that hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid significantly reduced swelling, increased mobility and decreased pain. Based on those&#xD;
      results, the investigators believe that a patented hyaluronic may show efficacy on increasing&#xD;
      mobility and reducing pain on the acute ankle sprain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this non-controlled study is to evaluate the efficacy and of hyaluronic acid&#xD;
      (Adant) in the treatment of acute ankle sprain. It is expected to decrease pain and swelling,&#xD;
      promote healing, improve time to return to pain and disability-free sport and not increase&#xD;
      adverse events compared to standard care and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.0 STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-site, open-label, non-controlled trial on the efficacy and safety of Adant&#xD;
      in patients with acute ankle sprain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a screening phase where patients will be assessed based on selected&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria. Prior to enrollment, patients will undergo a screening&#xD;
      assessment that will include a physical exam. A diagnosis of first or second-degree ankle&#xD;
      sprain will be made. Pain severity will be assessed using a Pain Visual Analogue Scale (VAS).&#xD;
      After enrollment, patients will be administered Adant (within 48 hours of injury).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Assessments will be done at baseline, days 8, 30 and 90. Efficacy measures will include&#xD;
      patient's VAS of pain on weight bearing (0-100mm) and walking 20m (0-100mm), patients' global&#xD;
      assessment of ankle injury (5 point categorical scale), patients' assessment of normal&#xD;
      function/activity (5 point categorical scale), physician's global assessment of ankle injury&#xD;
      (5 point categorical scale), patients/physician satisfaction assessment (10 point categorical&#xD;
      scale), time to return to pain-free and disability-free sport and adverse events as per WHO&#xD;
      definition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.0 ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA Before starting the screening assessment, each patient must be given&#xD;
      a complete explanation of the purpose and evaluations of the study. Subsequently, the&#xD;
      patients must sign and receive a copy of an informed consent document that was approved by an&#xD;
      ethics board. Once informed consent has been obtained, the eligibility of the patient will be&#xD;
      determined and Screening Phase assessments will be performed followed by the Treatment and&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 SCHEDULE OF TIME AND EVENTS The study will consist of a screening phase, a treatment&#xD;
      phase and a follow-up phase as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the Day 1 (within 48 hours of the injury), the patient will undergo an examination to&#xD;
      assess whether they meet all the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria after&#xD;
      signing the informed consent. The screening assessment includes a physical exam at which time&#xD;
      a diagnosis of first or second-degree sprain will be made. An x-ray of the ankle joint will&#xD;
      be performed to exclude other pathologies at the discretion of the study physician (ie to&#xD;
      exclude fracture). Patients will assess pain on a Visual Pain Analogue Scale (VAS) on weight&#xD;
      bearing and after walking 20 m. Patients will rate pain on a 100 mm VAS, with 0 representing&#xD;
      no pain and 100 representing maximal pain. Patients' global assessment of ankle injury (5&#xD;
      point categorical scale), patients' assessment of normal function/activity (5 point&#xD;
      categorical scale) and physician's global assessment of ankle injury (5 point categorical&#xD;
      scale) will be performed. Time to return to pain and disability-free sport will be determined&#xD;
      in days from review of a patient diary. After enrollment, patients will administered Adant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      One injection of Adant will be given on Day1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injections will be performed using previously (15) described syringes affixed to a 27-gauge,&#xD;
      1-inch needle. Skin will be prepped using betadine 1%. Injections will be delivered by the&#xD;
      study physician using a standard approach along the anterior talofibular ligament, using&#xD;
      clinical landmarks. The injection (2.5 mL total) will be delivered during a single&#xD;
      penetration along three planes (steps 1-3): anteroposterior, medial, and lateral to the&#xD;
      proximal ligamentous landmark (Fig. 1). All study physicians will attend a training session&#xD;
      to ensure standardization of injection technique, including video review of a sample of three&#xD;
      randomly selected patients during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will assess pain on a Visual Pain Analogue Scale (VAS) on weight bearing and after&#xD;
      walking 20 m. Patients' global assessment of ankle injury (5 point categorical scale),&#xD;
      patients' assessment of normal function/activity (5 point categorical scale), and physician's&#xD;
      global assessment of ankle injury (5 point categorical scale) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up examinations will be completed at Day 8 (± 2 days), Day 30 (± 2 days) and at Day 90&#xD;
      (± 7 days). Patients will assess pain on a Visual Pain Analogue Scale (VAS) on weight bearing&#xD;
      and after walking 20 m. Patients' global assessment of ankle injury (5 point categorical&#xD;
      scale), patients' assessment of normal function/activity (5 point categorical scale), and&#xD;
      physician's global assessment of ankle injury (5 point categorical scale) will be performed.&#xD;
      Also, patients/physician satisfaction assessment (10 point categorical scale) and review of a&#xD;
      patient diary for adverse events and return to pain and disability-free sport will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, including the follow-up period, the patients will receive usual care&#xD;
      including RICE (crutches, cane, ankle brand tape, air cast are allowed) and analgesics. The&#xD;
      analgesics use (Tylenol 500-1000mg daily) will be recorded in the patient's diary. No NSAID,&#xD;
      corticosteroid or topical analgesics will be allowed during the study. ASA at the dose of 325&#xD;
      mg and less for cardiovascular prophylaxis will be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.0 STUDY SUPPLIES Under no circumstances shall any of the investigational material supplied&#xD;
      for this study be used other than as directed in this protocol. All investigational syringe&#xD;
      (used and unused) will be accounted for by the study coordinator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.1 Adant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adant will be supplied in a single-dose syringe containing HA in enough excipient to make a&#xD;
      total volume of 2.5 mL (25mg in 1% solution). Syringes will be stored at room temperature&#xD;
      (10º-30ºC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      7.2 ACCOUNTABILITY OF STUDY SUPPLIES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each syringe used will be entered in a Study Product Dispensing Log. It is the responsibility&#xD;
      of the Investigator to ensure that all supplies are accounted for throughout this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Coordinator will record in the CRF, the date of each injection, product lot number,&#xD;
      and the number of syringes used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.0 OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS 8.1 SAFETY ASSESSMENTS During the treatment and follow-up phases, in&#xD;
      order to evaluate safety, the following assessments will be conducted on all patients that&#xD;
      receive at least one dose of study product.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (throughout the study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital signs&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2 EFFICACY ASSESSMENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy parameters are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS of pain on weight-bearing (day 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  VAS of pain on walking (20 m) (days 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient's global assessment of ankle injury (day 8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy assessments are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients assessment of normal function/ activity (days 8, 30, 90)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physician's global assessment of ankle injury (days 8, 30, 90)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients and Physicians Satisfaction Assessments (days 8, 30, 90)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to return to pain and disability-free sport (days 8, 30, 90)&#xD;
&#xD;
      9.0 REPORTING OF ADVERSE EVENTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      An adverse event is defined by the ICH as &quot;any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical&#xD;
      investigation subject administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily&#xD;
      have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and&#xD;
      unintended sign, symptom or disease temporarily associated with the use of an investigational&#xD;
      product, whether or not related to the product&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serious AE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose; (1) results in death, (2)&#xD;
      is life threatening, (3) results in inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing&#xD;
      hospitalization, (4) results in persistent or significantly disability or incapacity or (5)&#xD;
      results in congenital anomaly or birth defect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will report immediately all SAE to the Ethics Review. The investigator should&#xD;
      fill in a SAE report (see CRF) within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.0 STUDY SITE TERMINATION AND SUBJECT DISCONTINUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      A site may be terminated for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure of the site to recruit enough patients&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure of the site to comply with the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject may be discontinued for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Failure of a patient to comply with the protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious adverse event&#xD;
&#xD;
      11.0 DATA COLLECTION AND PROCESSING&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be recorded in the CRFs and collected by the Clinical Trial Study Monitor&#xD;
      during scheduled visits. The CRFs will be designed to assist the Investigator with protocol&#xD;
      compliance and to facilitate collection, interpretation and analysis of data. The CRFs must&#xD;
      be kept up to date and completed as specified. Data reported in a case report form (CRF)&#xD;
      should be consistent with source documents. Any change or correction to a CRF should be&#xD;
      dated, initialed and explained. CRFs will be monitored to ensure that the clinical trial is&#xD;
      conducted in accordance with the protocol, GCP and the applicable regulatory requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12.0 STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Patients 18 years of age and older who provide written informed&#xD;
      consent and who meet the inclusion and exclusion criteria will be entered into the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be based on the intent to treat population and the efficacy&#xD;
      evaluable population. The first population is defined as subjects who will receive any dose&#xD;
      of Adant, and the second efficacy-evaluable population is defined as the subjects who&#xD;
      completed Day 8 of the study. Efficacy and safety variables will be analyzed using&#xD;
      appropriate statistical methods. The data will be summarized in tables listing and all&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be performed and data appendices will be created using the SAS®&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study populations will include: the intent-to-treat population defined as all subjects&#xD;
      who receive the study treatment and have at least one efficacy assessment at Day 8; the&#xD;
      safety population who will be all patients who receive the study treatment whether or not&#xD;
      they have any efficacy assessments; and the per protocol population who receive the study&#xD;
      treatment and complete all efficacy assessments. The primary efficacy endpoint is the&#xD;
      decrease in pain on weight-bearing by Day 8. Other endpoints will be analyzed based on&#xD;
      patient's VAS of pain on weight bearing as well as walking, the patient's global assessment&#xD;
      of ankle injury, the patient's assessment of normal function/activity, the physician's global&#xD;
      assessment of ankle injury, and finally, time to return to pain and disability-free sport,&#xD;
      the patient and physician's satisfaction assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety analysis will be done on the intent-to treat population. AEs will be listed&#xD;
      individually and summarized by body system and preferred terms within a body system. Safety&#xD;
      parameters will also include vital signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      13.0 CLINICAL STUDY ADMINISTRATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The written informed consent to be provided to patients should adhere to GCP and to the&#xD;
      ethical principles for medical research involving human subjects as defined in the&#xD;
      Declaration of Helsinki. Prior to the beginning of the trial, the written informed consent&#xD;
      must have been approved by the ethics review board.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent must be obtained for each patient prior to performing any&#xD;
      screening/baseline evaluation. One copy of the informed consent will be given to the subject,&#xD;
      and another will be retained by the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any revision to the written informed consent must be approved by the ethics review board.&#xD;
      Furthermore any communication between the investigator and the ethics review board should be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study documentation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should ensure the accuracy and completeness of the data reported in CRFs.&#xD;
      The investigator should maintain the essential documents for the conduct of a clinical trial&#xD;
      as specified by the GCPs and for as long as required by the applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
