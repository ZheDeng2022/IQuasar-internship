    <textblock>
      Context: Chest wall deformities in children are relatively common. One such deformity, known&#xD;
      as Pectus Excavatum (PE), involves a concavity of the chest and is the most frequent of these&#xD;
      abnormalities - present in approximately 1 out of every 400-1000 births. This deformity is&#xD;
      often a cosmetic problem for affected individuals. When severe, PE can also be associated&#xD;
      with cardiopulmonary compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of PE involves surgical correction. There are several potential methods for&#xD;
      correcting PE. In the past the most common repair involved an open procedure which involves&#xD;
      excision and reshaping of the ribcage. More recently a minimally invasive procedure has been&#xD;
      adopted involving the placement of a stainless steel or titanium bar underneath the sternum&#xD;
      to reshape the chest wall. This procedure, commonly known as the Nuss procedure, carries with&#xD;
      it significant post-operative pain management problems. In fact, the pain issues after Nuss&#xD;
      procedure may be more significant than after open repair. The quality of postoperative pain&#xD;
      control in these cases has been shown to affect several measurable objective outcomes during&#xD;
      hospitalization including capacity for deep breathing, early mobilization, ambulation, and&#xD;
      length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidural analgesia (EA) has been one of the standard methods for managing pain in the early&#xD;
      postoperative period after PE repair. Unfortunately severe pain may persist after the removal&#xD;
      of an epidural catheter resulting in a difficult &quot;transition&quot; period just prior to discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital. In addition reports of neurological injury after epidural analgesia for&#xD;
      Nuss procedures have appeared. In light of these issues, many institutions have opted for&#xD;
      alternative methods of pain control including peripheral nerve blocks, patient controlled&#xD;
      analgesia, and wound catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There remains significant debate as to which pain control methodology is best. There is&#xD;
      little consistent data available on pain control or outcomes that occur after EA is stopped.&#xD;
      Moreover there is reluctance in any one institution to trial or randomize patients to a&#xD;
      variety of treatment modalities. For all of these reasons, investigators are proposing&#xD;
      participation in a multi-institutional data sharing project concerning the repair of EA in&#xD;
      which participating centers will collaborate to better understand the outcomes of&#xD;
      perioperative care for patients undergoing correction of this problem.&#xD;

      postoperative period after PE repair. Unfortunately severe pain may persist after the removal&#xD;
      of an epidural catheter resulting in a difficult &quot;transition&quot; period just prior to discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital. In addition reports of neurological injury after epidural analgesia for&#xD;
      Nuss procedures have appeared. In light of these issues, many institutions have opted for&#xD;
      alternative methods of pain control including peripheral nerve blocks, patient controlled&#xD;
      analgesia, and wound catheters. There remains significant debate as to which pain control&#xD;
      methodology is best. There is little consistent data available on pain control or outcomes&#xD;
      that occur after EA is stopped. Moreover there is reluctance in any one institution to trial&#xD;
      or randomize patients to a variety of treatment modalities. For all of these reasons,&#xD;
      investigators are proposing participation in a multi-institutional data sharing project&#xD;
      concerning the repair of EA in which participating centers will collaborate to better&#xD;
      understand the outcomes of perioperative care for patients undergoing correction of this&#xD;
      problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to create a multicenter registry which captures data relating to the&#xD;
      perioperative course and management of children undergoing PE repair surgery. This effort is&#xD;
      undertaken in order to augment safety and quality improvement activities at participating&#xD;
      sites. Investigators understand that there are multiple methodologies for accomplishing the&#xD;
      anesthesia and perioperative pain control for this surgery. There is little comparative data&#xD;
      on the outcomes from the different possible management strategies. Given the relative&#xD;
      frequencies of these surgeries where few centers perform more than 20-50 of these procedures&#xD;
      per year, it is not practical for any one (or two) centers to study this procedure in an&#xD;
      observational manner or a controlled randomized trial. Investigators' aggregate&#xD;
      multi-institutional data set will be used for benchmarking for both local and national safety&#xD;
      and quality improvement efforts. Participating sites will be provided with reports comparing&#xD;
      the local site to the aggregate dataset for specific perioperative outcome variables (e.g.&#xD;
      pain metrics) and factors that could be associated with improved outcomes. Outcome variables&#xD;
      include but are not limited to intraoperative hemodynamics, pain control, emergence&#xD;
      agitation, apnea/airway obstruction, hemodynamic stability, time to first ambulation, pain&#xD;
      scores while in the hospital, total hospital days, time to school or work attendance, and&#xD;
      symptoms of post-traumatic stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: Investigators will ultimately look at the relationship between specific&#xD;
      management metrics such as the use of epidural anesthesia vs. peripheral nerve blocks vs.&#xD;
      local anesthesia wound infiltration and our primary outcome metrics. In addition&#xD;
      Investigators will consider the frequency of long term Post Traumatic Stress behaviors and&#xD;
      the various measures of pain control in the perioperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basic design: Prospective observational multicenter data registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting/Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients ages 8 to 30 years undergoing surgery for Pectus Excavatum Repair in a hospital&#xD;
           setting&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 20 hospital sites&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection, Storage and Release:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry will capture data relating to the perioperative management of children&#xD;
      undergoing PE repair. Measures will include demographic data, data on degree of deformity,&#xD;
      perioperative management, intraoperative management, hospital course, surgical technique,&#xD;
      complications, and long term pain/psychological outcomes.&#xD;
