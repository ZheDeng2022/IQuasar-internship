        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female patients ages 2 months to 12 years of age with a clinical diagnosis of&#xD;
             AOM, and with ear pain (current episode &lt;2 weeks duration). Baseline pain entry&#xD;
             requires a minimum score of 4 on the FLACC or the FPS-R scale (depending on age)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients must provide Institutional Review Board (IRB) approved written assent, as&#xD;
             appropriate, which must be accompanied by an IRB approved written informed consent&#xD;
             form (ICF) from the patient's legally acceptable representative (i.e., parent or&#xD;
             guardian), as applicable. In addition, all patients or their legally acceptable&#xD;
             representatives (i.e., parent or guardian) must sign a Health Insurance Portability&#xD;
             and Accountability Act (HIPAA) authorization, if applicable&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be normally active and otherwise judged to be in good health on the&#xD;
             basis of the medical history and a limited physical examination, as determined by the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of child bearing potential must have a negative urine human chorionic&#xD;
             gonadotropin (hCG) pregnancy test at Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with bilateral AOM, perforated tympanic membrane, history of a perforated&#xD;
             tympanic membrane in the last 6 months, or if a perforated tympanic membrane could not&#xD;
             be ruled out by speculum examination, impedance testing tympanometry, pneumatic&#xD;
             otoscopy, or a Valsalva maneuver&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are subsequently diagnosed with a perforated membrane during treatment&#xD;
             are to be discontinued immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with indwelling tympanostomy tubes or draining otitis in the affected ear(s),&#xD;
             bullous lesions, erythema of the tympanic membrane without other evidence of AOM, and&#xD;
             patients with an anatomic defect of the ear or nasopharynx&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Complications of treated/untreated ear disease over the past 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with comorbidity requiring antibiotic therapy, allergy to study medication,&#xD;
             immunologic deficiency, and major medical condition(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with methemoglobinemia or a history of methemoglobinemia, vertigo, inherited&#xD;
             enzyme deficiencies, impaired cardiac or respiratory functions, epilepsy, heart&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any topical drying agent or over-the-counter (OTC) therapy for otitis media received&#xD;
             within 36 hours prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fever &gt;102°F&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to the study drug or similar compounds including any of the&#xD;
             inactive ingredients&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving medication on a chronic basis for pain (including steroidal or&#xD;
             non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of ear drops or oral analgesics such as ibuprofen/acetaminophen within the 4 hours&#xD;
             prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of sulfonamides, aminosalicylates, anti- cholinesterases, suxamethonium,&#xD;
             antiarrhythmics, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, or tricyclic antidepressants&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant mental illness (as determined by the Investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to any investigational agent within the 30 days prior to study entry&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  The child has a condition that the Investigator believes would interfere with the&#xD;
             ability to provide assent (age appropriate) or comply with study instructions, or that&#xD;
             might confound the interpretation of the study results, or put the child at undue risk&#xD;
