  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators at the Biomedical Imaging Research Institute (BIRI) at Cedars-Sinai Medical&#xD;
      Center have developed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) method for imaging coronary arteries&#xD;
      using slow-infusion, contrast-enhanced data acquisition. This method allows faster data&#xD;
      acquisition and better spatial resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. compare coronary artery imaging with and without contrast media on both healthy subjects&#xD;
           and patients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. assess the accuracy of coronary MRI in detecting coronary artery disease as compared to&#xD;
           conventional x-ray angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers hypothesize that contrast-enhanced MRI will improve the delineation of coronary&#xD;
      arteries over non-contrast-enhanced MRI and that optimized, contrast-enhanced coronary MRI&#xD;
      technique will accurately detect coronary artery disease (CAD) as compared to conventional&#xD;
      x-ray angiography.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to compare image quality between contrast and non-contrast cardiac MR and to&#xD;
      evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of a cardiac MRI procedure in a patient population that&#xD;
      includes both healthy volunteers and a study group of patients with known CAD who are&#xD;
      scheduled for clinical coronary angiography within one month of signing informed consent.&#xD;
      Both groups are eligible for a combination of imaging tests. Subjects may receive either a&#xD;
      non-contrast MRI or a contrast-enhanced MRI depending upon their kidney function and study&#xD;
      focus. Also based upon the focus of the study at the time of the scan and to improve image&#xD;
      quality, a beta-blocker to lessen motion artifact in patients with higher heart rates may be&#xD;
      administered or patients may be asked to undergo a stress test for comparison.This is a&#xD;
      one-day research procedure. Studies are acquired from the approved Institutional Review Board&#xD;
      #25881 Cedars-Sinai Biomedical Imaging Research Registry.&#xD;

    <description>The following procedures may be conducted as part of this study:&#xD;
Coronary MRI scan with no contrast&#xD;
Coronary MRI scan enhanced with a gadolinium-based contrast agent (Optimark, MultiHance, Ablavar) administered intravenously at a total dose of up to 0.2 mmol/kg&#xD;
MRI scan with an oral beta blocker (metoprolol)&#xD;
Cardiac Stress Test MRI scan with a pharmacologic stress drug; either adenosine (dosage depends on the subject's weight and is set at 140mcg/kg/min) or regadenoson (0.4mg/5ml bolus)&#xD;
Determination of study drugs will be made depending upon study focus, subjects' health conditions, blood pressure, heart rate and concomitant medications. Both groups are eligible for all combinations of interventions.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Persons with ferromagnetic implants and ferromagnetic foreign bodies, such as&#xD;
             intracranial, aneurysm clips, shrapnel and intraocular metal chips as these could&#xD;

          -  Patients who are pregnant, nursing are implanted with intrauterine devices (IUD's)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons who are in atrial fibrillation at the time of the MR scan as this could result&#xD;
             in poor image quality due to interference with electrocardiographic gating necessary&#xD;
             for image acquisition.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Persons unable to tolerate MRI imaging secondary to an inability to lie supine or&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Allergy to animal dander or animal-instigated asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specific to Ablavar: Baseline ECG measurements and concomitant medications will be&#xD;
             checked on subjects who are chosen to participate in the Ablavar study, based upon&#xD;
             study needs. If the ECG measurements and/or medications indicate that the subject is&#xD;
             at high risk for arrhythmia, the subject will be excluded from the Ablavar study, but&#xD;
             can participate in the OptiMark/MultiHance contrast study or non-contrast study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specific to beta-blocker administration: no contraindication to beta blockers. If the&#xD;
             subject is found to have a contraindication to beta-blockers or declines the&#xD;
             administration of beta-blockers the subject will be excluded from the beta-blocker&#xD;
             portion but can still participate in a non-contrast or contrast-enhanced scan without&#xD;
             beta-blocker administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specific to Regadenoson: no contraindication to regadenoson administration. If the&#xD;
             subject is found to have a contraindication to regadenoson the subject will be&#xD;
             excluded from the regadenoson portion but can still participate in a non-contrast or&#xD;
             contrast-enhanced scan without regadenoson stress testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Specific to Adenosine: no contraindication to adenosine administration.If the subject&#xD;
             is found to have a contraindication to adenosine the subject will be excluded from the&#xD;
