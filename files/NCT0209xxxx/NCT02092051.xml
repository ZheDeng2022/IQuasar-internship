      Breif summary&#xD;
&#xD;
      A keystone in preventing diabetic complications in patients with type 1 diabetes is good&#xD;
      glycaemic control. Frequent self-measurements of blood glucose (SMBG) levels has been an&#xD;
      essential part of insulin dosing before meals. However, in recent years continuous glucose&#xD;
      monitoring (CGM) has become a treatment option for notifying the patient on trends in glucose&#xD;
      levels and warning when these are estimated to be too high and too low.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In some countries today, Sweden among others, CGM is reimbursed in combination with&#xD;
      continuous subcutaneous insulin infusions (CSII) in patients with very poor glycaemic control&#xD;
      or a history of repeated severe hypoglycaemia in adult type 1 diabetic patients. This is&#xD;
      based on existing clinical trials showing a beneficial effect on HbA1c by combining CGM with&#xD;
      CSII. However, the majority of adult type 1 diabetic patients are treated with multiple daily&#xD;
      insulin injections (MDI). Clinical trial data are sparse on the effect of CGM in adult type 1&#xD;
      diabetic patients treated with MDI, and there are no clinical trial data including only&#xD;
      patients on MDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the current study is to evaluate effectiveness, safety and treatment satisfaction&#xD;
      among adult type 1 diabetic patients on CGM treated with MDI. The design is a 69-week,&#xD;
      cross-over clinical trial, including 26 weeks treatment with CGM, 26 weeks treatment with&#xD;
      conventional SMBG and a wash-out period of 17 weeks. In total 120 patients will be included&#xD;
      at 8 sites in Sweden. The study will have 80% power to detect a 3 mmol/mol (0.3 percentage&#xD;
      unit) change in HbA1c resulting from CGM.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      A keystone in preventing diabetic complications in patients with type 1 diabetes is good&#xD;
      glycaemic control (1). Today, intensive glycaemic treatment is generally achieved through&#xD;
      multiple daily insulin injections (MDI) or an insulin pump, also termed continuous&#xD;
      subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII, [2]). Regular capillary self-measured blood glucose&#xD;
      values have been most crucial in obtaining good glycaemic control and guiding the patient on&#xD;
      insulin doses (3, 4, 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During recent years continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) has become a treatment option for&#xD;
      guiding the patient on insulin dosage and other activities (6). CGM has the advantage of&#xD;
      informing the patient on estimated glucose values continuously, not the least important of&#xD;
      which is to illustrate trends on increases or decreases in glucose levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from several clinical trials on CGM has shown divergent results on its glycaemic control&#xD;
      effects (7). In some clinical trials, only patients on CSII have been included or have&#xD;
      initiated CGM and CSII simultaneously as an intervention. In other trials both patients with&#xD;
      MDI and CSII have been included, and post hoc analyses have also resulted in divergent&#xD;
      findings whether the effect on glycaemic control potentially differs when combining CGM with&#xD;
      MDI or CSII (8, 9, 10). Although the absolute majority of adult type 1 diabetic patients are&#xD;
      treated with MDI, clinical trials initiating CGM in a pure MDI-treated group are absent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current trial is a cross-over design and 69 weeks in duration, where patients will be&#xD;
      randomized patients to CGM-treatment for 26 weeks, conventional therapy for 26 weeks and a&#xD;
      wash-out period for 17 weeks. The primary endpoint is the effect on HbA1c.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose/aim&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to analyse the effect of CGM on glycaemic control measured by A1C,&#xD;
      high and low glucose levels measured by CGM, and quality of life in patients with type 1&#xD;
      diabetes treated with MDI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studied intervention will be CGM (Dexcom G4, Dexcom Corporation) which will be compared&#xD;
      to conventional therapy using only self-measurements of blood glucose levels (SMBG) for&#xD;
      guiding the dosage of insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a maximum run-in period of six weeks patients will be randomized to either CGM or&#xD;
      continued conventional therapy. During the run-in period blinded CGM will be performed during&#xD;
      two weeks. After the blinded CGM period patients that do not believe they will wear a CGM&#xD;
      sensor more than 80% of the study time during the period of randomization to CGM, or patients&#xD;
      who did not perform adequate calibrations during the run-in period (on average at least 12 of&#xD;
      14 during a 7-day period), will not be randomized. The patient will be shown an example&#xD;
      picture of glucose curves (not their own curves) with trend arrows, explained by the&#xD;
      physician/diabetic educator to give the patient a better chance to judge how often they will&#xD;
      use the sensor. Consenting patients will be randomized to CGM or conventional therapy for 26&#xD;
      weeks and conventional therapy for 26 weeks, with an intermittent wash-out period for 17&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be initially randomized 1:1, stratified by site, to CGM or conventional&#xD;
      therapy. A centralised web system will be used for randomisation. Each patient will be&#xD;
      assigned a unique and anonymous Subject ID at randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected study duration for each participant is 72 weeks, including an assumed mean&#xD;
      run-in period of 3 weeks. The total study period is expected to be 84 weeks, including a&#xD;
      recruitment period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection and withdrawal of subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients fulfilling all inclusion and no exclusion criteria will have their HbA1c levels,&#xD;
      fasting C-peptide and creatinine analysed by the central laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is planned to include 120 patients randomized 1:1, stratified by site, to CGM or&#xD;
      conventional therapy. Treatment will be for 26 weeks for each group, with a wash-out period&#xD;
      of 17 weeks between treatments. An expected drop-out rate is assumed to be 5%-10% without&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescreening&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescreening of patients is possible in the study, but maximally at one time. There is no time&#xD;
      limit for rescreening. It can be performed at any interval from previous screening.&#xD;
      Rescreening can be performed for any inclusion/exclusion criterion that did not fit the&#xD;
      inclusion criteria or fulfilled any exclusion criteria at the previous screening. However,&#xD;
      there should be a possibility that this criterion can fit this inclusion criterion or not fit&#xD;
      the exclusion criterion at the rescreening visit; e.g. that the glycaemic control has&#xD;
      worsened since last screening and HbA1c did not fit inclusion criteria at the previous&#xD;
      screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the run-in period all patients will have blinded CGM during two weeks. If the patient&#xD;
      believes after performing blinded CGM that he/she will not be able to wear the sensor and use&#xD;
      the CGM-system during the majority of the study period (more than 80% of the time) when&#xD;
      randomized to CGM, he/she will be excluded from randomization. In addition, subjects not&#xD;
      adherent with calibration procedures (require on average &gt; 12 out of 14 calibrations over a 7&#xD;
      days period). There should be at least 10 days with valid blinded CGM data before&#xD;
      randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the trial will be instructed regarding basic information on insulin dosing,&#xD;
      such as bolus correction, types of food elevating glucose levels and the effect of physical&#xD;
      activity on glucose control. This information will be provided at the same level as in&#xD;
      clinical practice for patients with type 1 diabetes, i.e. to guarantee that all patients have&#xD;
      basic skills for dosing insulin. All patients will also be educated on the proportion of&#xD;
      rapid acting insulin analogues remaining at various time points after injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At clinical visits the care-giver will discuss glucose levels measured by SMBG and CGM data&#xD;
      with the patient for possible improvements in the diabetes care. This will be performed in&#xD;
      correspondence with intensive therapy used in clinical practice. All patients will have the&#xD;
      possibility to contact the responsible staff for the trial at each site for additional&#xD;
      support between the visits if needed, e.g. technical problems with SMBG meters or the DexCom&#xD;
      4G system, but extra visits will not be planned with the aim of improving the glycaemic&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During at least the first week of randomization to CGM there will be no alarm levels set on&#xD;
      the CGM, other than a constantly active acute alarm to low glucose levels. The reason is that&#xD;
      the patient shall be taught to be active in judging trends of CGM and not only reacting at&#xD;
      certain levels for alarms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alarm settings will be introduced 2 weeks after randomization, at the latest. At each visit&#xD;
      the patient will be motivated to be active using the information from the CGM at least every&#xD;
      1-2 hours during daytime. In correspondence, patients will be motivated in measuring blood&#xD;
      glucose levels when randomized to conventional therapy in accordance with guidelines, i.e. at&#xD;
      least 4 times a day. At the 2 initial visits of each treatment period patients will be&#xD;
      checked for general skills adopted on dosing insulin, types of foods that elevate glucose&#xD;
      levels and the influence of physical activity on glucose levels. BG-values will be evaluated&#xD;
      at the visits for patients receiving conventional therapy for possible improvements in dosing&#xD;
      insulin, food intake and physical activity. In correspondence, CGM-curves will be analysed as&#xD;
      well as algorithms for dosage of insulin from CGM-data and physical activity and influence of&#xD;
      eating habits on glucose levels. When randomized to CGM patients will be instructed at the&#xD;
      start point of the treatment phase and the two consecutive visits on a predefined algorithm&#xD;
      for adjusting insulin. In each treatment phase visits will take place at starting point,&#xD;
      weeks 2, 4, 13 and 26.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinded CGM will be performed for all participants during two weeks before baseline and two&#xD;
      weeks before the starting point of the second treatment phase. Participants randomized to&#xD;
      conventional therapy will also have CGM during 2 of the 4 last weeks of each treatment period&#xD;
      (performed 23-26 and 66-69 respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HbA1c will be recorded at the starting point of each treatment period and all subsequent&#xD;
      study visits except week 2 in each treatment phase. At starting point and at the end of each&#xD;
      treatment phase extended blood samples will be taken including biobank samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At all visits SMBG and CGM data will be downloaded for randomized patients, and a diabetes&#xD;
      educator or physician will discuss potential improvements for optimising glycaemic control&#xD;
      with the patient. SMBG-data will be downloaded also for patients with CGM-treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescue criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the clinician or diabetic educator determines that CGM use is associated with severe&#xD;
      risks, e.g., severe hypoglycaemia, CGM treatment shall be stopped and the patient will&#xD;
      receive conventional treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment satisfaction and quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will fill in questionnaires before blinded CGM of each treatment phase and at the&#xD;
      end of each treatment phase. The DTSQ has been used in many diabetes therapy clinical trials&#xD;
      and is a validated questionnaire consisting of 8 questions. Two versions are used, the DTSQs&#xD;
      and DTSQc, where the DTSQs is used for recording the current treatment satisfaction and the&#xD;
      DTSQc for patients to retrospectively compare various treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWE-HFS consists of 23 questions concerning actions to prevent hypoglycaemia and fears about&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia. The Swedish translation has been well validated (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWE-PAID-20 consists of 20 questions regarding situations about diabetes that may be a&#xD;
      problem to the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHO-5 consists of 5 questions assessing patient well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IPAQ consists of 4 questions of various levels of physical activity during the last 7 days.&#xD;
      (13)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia confidence questionnaire consists of 9 questions regarding how confident the&#xD;
      patients are regarding handling of hypoglycaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires will be completed at the study site. The patients will be allowed to&#xD;
      individually complete the questionnaires in a reasonably quiet environment. It will be&#xD;
      emphasized that patients complete the questionnaires prior to clinical measurements and&#xD;
      before meeting a doctor. Questionnaires should be answered by the patient alone; however, the&#xD;
      nurse/assistant will be informed to help patients complete the questionnaires, if necessary,&#xD;
      but without influencing patients' responses. Only the anonymous Subject ID will be used to&#xD;
      identify questionnaires to ensure patient confidentiality. Study nurses/assistants should&#xD;
      check questionnaires for completeness. The PI shall ensure that appropriate study training is&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoglycaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periods of hypoglycaemia will be compared using blinded CGM versus randomization to open CGM&#xD;
      during the corresponding time period. The regular definitions of hypoglycaemia using SMBG&#xD;
      will be difficult to compare since patients using CGM will detect asymptomatic hypoglycaemia&#xD;
      due to CGM and be more alert to symptoms of hypoglycaemia. The number of severe hypoglycaemic&#xD;
      events, defined as unconsciousness due to hypoglycaemia or need of assistance from another&#xD;
      person to resolve hypoglycaemia, will be recorded. The time with low glucose values will be&#xD;
      analysed by comparing active treatment with CGM with blinded CGM for the corresponding time&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
