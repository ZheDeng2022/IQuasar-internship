  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective observational trial that will enroll pregnant women between 24 and 36&#xD;
      6/7 weeks of gestation that present with signs and symptom of preterm labor with clinically&#xD;
      intact membranes and cervical dilatation ≤ 3 cm and a control group of pregnant women without&#xD;
      signs and risks for PTL to assess how the results of the novel kit for the detection of&#xD;
      PAMG-1 in both patient groups correlate to their time-to-delivery (TTD) and other adverse&#xD;
      neonatal and pregnancy outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thes study hypothesis contains that the novel diagnostic kit will identify women who are at&#xD;
      high risk for preterm birth by a high positive predictive value.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placental alpha microglobulin-1 (PAMG-1) is a protein found in high concentrations in&#xD;
      amniotic fluid but very low concentrations in background levels of cervico-vaginal discharge.&#xD;
      In recent years, the medical community has increasingly accepted the widespread use of&#xD;
      detecting PAMG-1 to aid the provider in confirming or ruling out rupture of the fetal&#xD;
      membranes (ROM). The test used is commercially marketed as the AmniSure® ROM Test,&#xD;
      manufactured by AmniSure® International, LLC, Boston, MA, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In one of the original investigations of PAMG-1 for the detection of ROM, Lee et al. noted&#xD;
      that in 20 out of the 23 cases where the AmniSure® ROM Test was positive and standard&#xD;
      clinical assessment (i.e. nitrazine, ferning and pooling) was negative, the patient was&#xD;
      ultimately determined to have been ruptured upon retrospective analysis of their clinical&#xD;
      course. It was later reported that for all of the preterm patients in this group that showed&#xD;
      signs and symptoms of labor, delivery followed within 7 days. In 2011, the clinical value of&#xD;
      a positive AmniSure® ROM Test in the patient presenting with signs and symptoms of preterm&#xD;
      labor (PTL) but without membrane rupture was investigated by this same group. The results&#xD;
      demonstrated that the AmniSure® ROM Test was highly predictive of delivery of these patients&#xD;
      within 48 hours, 7 days and 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the patient group on whom the above tests are performed, membrane rupture is excluded as&#xD;
      this condition, if present, confirms imminent delivery and dictates a different course of&#xD;
      management. It has been demonstrated that the AmniSure® ROM Test can detect PAMG-1 in&#xD;
      patients presenting with signs and symptoms of ROM when all other traditional methods are&#xD;
      unable to do so. The likelihoods of adverse outcomes associated with these sub-clinical&#xD;
      ruptures have been demonstrated to not be statistically different from the adverse outcomes&#xD;
      associated with gross or clinically detectable ruptures. The proposed physiological&#xD;
      explanation for this phenomenon is that PAMG-1 is released through micro-perforations of the&#xD;
      amniotic membranes that more copious amounts of fluid cannot pass through.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major difference, however, between the patient presenting with signs of preterm labor and&#xD;
      those just described above is the presence, or absence, of membrane rupture signs or&#xD;
      complaints. Given that the complaints of ROM are typically rooted in an overt episode of&#xD;
      suspicious fluid leakage, it is hypothesized that the resulting concentration of PAMG-1 in&#xD;
      the vagina of the patient without such overt complaints or signs of ROM will be lower than&#xD;
      the current sensitivity threshold of the AmniSure® ROM Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accordingly, a device that is more sensitive in its detection of PAMG-1 than the AmniSure®&#xD;
      ROM Test presumably will be able to detect more patients at risk for imminent delivery than&#xD;
      its predecessor in patients presenting to labor and delivery units with signs, symptoms or&#xD;
      complaints suggestive of preterm labor (PTL) who have no clinical evidence of membrane&#xD;
      rupture. If this is the case, this tool may be of significant value to the provider in&#xD;
      deciding how to manage their patients suspected to be at risk for imminent delivery.&#xD;
      Management options may include administration of tocolytics to prolong gestation,&#xD;
      corticosteroids to improve respiratory development, administration of antibiotics to decrease&#xD;
      the risk of infection (intra-partum and post-partum), prescription of bed rest, as well as&#xD;
      increased observation and fetal monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) indicate in their&#xD;
      most recent Practice Bulletin on the Management of Preterm Labor that many tests to identify&#xD;
      women at risk of preterm birth have been proposed and evaluated; however, only&#xD;
      ultrasonography and fetal fibronectin testing have been shown to have benefit.&#xD;
      Ultrasonography to determine cervical length, fetal fibronectin testing, or a combination of&#xD;
      both may be useful in determining which women are at high risk for preterm delivery. However,&#xD;
      their clinical usefulness may rest primarily with their ability to identify women who are&#xD;
      least likely to deliver (i.e. their negative predictive value). Therefore, there is an urgent&#xD;
      need for a test with a high positive predictive value in order to accurately predict imminent&#xD;
      delivery to allow for salutary intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the efficacy of the novel kit for the detection of PAMG-1 in the&#xD;
           cervico-vaginal secretions of pregnant women with clinically intact membranes presenting&#xD;
           with signs and symptoms of PTL in predicting time-to-delivery. Assessment will be&#xD;
           stratified by the following gestational age ranges:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. 24-31 6/7 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. 32-36 6/7 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the results of the novel kit for the detection of PAMG-1 in pregnant women&#xD;
           presenting with signs of PTL to a control group of pregnant women with the same&#xD;
           gestational age without any symptoms and without an elevated risk of preterm birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the novel kit for the detection of PAMG-1 to other methods available in&#xD;
           assessing time to delivery in the same patient population, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. cervical length measurements by trans-vaginal ultrasound&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. cervical dilatation &gt; 1 cm&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Contraction Frequency ≥ 6 per hour (one every 10 min)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determine the association between the results of the kit, cervical length and neonatal&#xD;
           outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study group: Patient presenting with symptoms of PTL between 24 and 36 6/7 weeks of&#xD;
           gestation signs informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Control group: Patient presenting for routine pregnancy control without any symptoms of&#xD;
           PTL is between 24 an 36 6/7 weeks of gestation signs informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specimen for the PAMG-1 test is collected in accordance with manufacturer's&#xD;
           recommendations. During the same examination the physician takes a vaginal&#xD;
           microbiological smear.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The sample is labeled and stored for later examination by a separate investigator who&#xD;
           will not know the results of the physician's regular clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. After the physician completes their physical examination of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Cervical length measurement by transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) is performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Patient delivery data (e.g. time, condition, etc.) are recorded in the follow up.&#xD;

    <description>The novel kit for the detection of PAMG-1 is a diagnostic device employing monoclonal antibodies that detect Placental α1 Microglobulin present in cervico-vaginal secretions manufactured by AmniSure® International, LLC, Boston, MA. The in vivo sensitivity detection threshold is 4ng/ml. During the test procedure, PAMG-1 from the sample sequentially binds to monoclonal antibody conjugated with labeled particles, then to monoclonal antibody immobilized on an insoluble carrier. The test requires a 30 second swab saturation in the vagina (a sterile speculum examination is not required), a 30 second active washing step whereby the swab just removed from the vagina is actively rotated in a solvent filled vial and lastly, a 5 minute waiting period from the time the swab is removed and the test strip is inserted if two testing lines do not appear sooner.</description>
