    <description>Blinded evaluators grade photographs using the Fitzpatrick wrinkle severity scale and provide an overall score for each timepoint. The Fitzpatrick wrinkle scale classifies wrinkles on a scale from 1 (mild) to 9 (severe). Scores of 1-3 are for mild wrinkles, meaning that there are fine texture changes with subtly accentuated skin lines. Scores of 4-6 are for fine to moderate depth wrinkles or moderate amount of lines with distinct popular elastosis and dyschromia. Scores of 7-9 are for fine to deep wrinkles, with numerous lines with or without redundant skin folds. It is characterized by multiple papules and confluent elastosis.</description>

          <title>Fitzpatrick Skin Type Score</title>
          <description>The Fitzpatrick Skin Score is used to determine skin color. It is a numerical system that classifies skin into six types (Type I, Type II, Type III, Type IV, Type V and Type VI) based on the numerical score achieved (ranging from 0 to 36). The lower the score (and skin type number), the fairer the skin. The higher the score (and skin type number), the more deeply pigmented the skin is.&#xD;

        <title>Photographic Evaluation of Wrinkle Severity at Baseline</title>
        <description>Blinded evaluators grade photographs using the Fitzpatrick wrinkle severity scale and provide an overall score for each timepoint. The Fitzpatrick wrinkle scale classifies wrinkles on a scale from 1 (mild) to 9 (severe). Scores of 1-3 are for mild wrinkles, meaning that there are fine texture changes with subtly accentuated skin lines. Scores of 4-6 are for fine to moderate depth wrinkles or moderate amount of lines with distinct popular elastosis and dyschromia. Scores of 7-9 are for fine to deep wrinkles, with numerous lines with or without redundant skin folds. It is characterized by multiple papules and confluent elastosis.</description>

        <description>Blinded evaluators grade photographs using the Fitzpatrick wrinkle severity scale and provide an overall score for each timepoint. The Fitzpatrick wrinkle scale classifies wrinkles on a scale from 1 (mild) to 9 (severe). Scores of 1-3 are for mild wrinkles, meaning that there are fine texture changes with subtly accentuated skin lines. Scores of 4-6 are for fine to moderate depth wrinkles or moderate amount of lines with distinct popular elastosis and dyschromia. Scores of 7-9 are for fine to deep wrinkles, with numerous lines with or without redundant skin folds. It is characterized by multiple papules and confluent elastosis.</description>
