      The purpose of this study is to assess the cognitive effects associated with administration&#xD;
      of intranasal esketamine 84 mg.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized (participants assigned to 1 of 2 treatment sequences by chance),&#xD;
      double-blind (identity of study drugs will not be known to participant or members of study&#xD;
      staff), placebo-controlled (a substance without active drug identical in appearance to&#xD;
      esketamine), 2-period crossover study (participants assigned to each treatment sequence will&#xD;
      receive 1 dose of esketamine and 1 dose of placebo administered intranasally [through the&#xD;
      nose]) conducted in healthy adult participants at a single center. Participants will complete&#xD;
      3 study phases: A screening phase of up to 3 weeks; a 2-week double-blind treatment phase,&#xD;
      which includes 2 treatment periods (Periods 1 and 2) separated by a washout interval of at&#xD;
      least 7 days; and, a 1-week posttreatment (follow up) phase, if applicable. The duration of&#xD;
      the study for each participant will be approximately 6 weeks. Blood and urine samples will be&#xD;
      collected during the study for laboratory assessments. Participants will be monitored for&#xD;
      safety from the time of signing the informed consent form up until 1 week after the last dose&#xD;
      of study drug (or end of treatment).&#xD;

    <measure>Change from baseline in cognitive functioning measured by the The Cogstate® Computerized Battery</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 1 at -1 hour, 40 minutes, and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing (or at the end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The Cogstate® Computerized Battery of tests will include 5 tests: Detection (simple reaction time task measuring processing speed [lower score = better performance]); Identification (choice reaction time paradigm measuring attention [lower score = better performance]); One Card Learning (visual episodic memory measure [higher score = better performance]); One Back ( &quot;n-back&quot; working memory measure [higher score = better performance]); and, Groton Maze Learning Test (executive function measure; total number of errors made in attempting to learn the same hidden pathway on five consecutive trials at a single session [lower score = better performance]) (Maruff 2004, Snyder 2005).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in cognitive functioning measured by the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>On day 1 at -1 hour, 40 minutes, and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing (or at the end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The KSS is a subject-reported assessment used to rate sleepiness on a scale of 1 to 9, ranging from 'extremely alert' (1) to 'very sleepy, great effort to keep awake, fighting sleep' (9) (Akerstedt 1990).</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in cognitive functioning measured by the mental effort scale</measure>
    <time_frame>On Day 1 at -1 hour, 40 minutes, and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after dosing (or at the end of treatment)</time_frame>
    <description>The mental effort scale is a subject-reported assessment of the level of effort needed to complete the test battery on a 15-cm equal interval scale (Zijlstra1993).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The concentration of esketamine and noresketamine from time zero to the last observable concentration (AUClast)</measure>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) of esketamine and noresketamine</measure>
