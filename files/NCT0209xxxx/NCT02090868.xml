  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to explore how the introduction of an oral intake screening tool can benefit&#xD;
      patients requiring noninvasive ventilation. The Quality Care Commission has identified&#xD;
      nutritional problems in hospital and there is much literature on the importance of nutrition&#xD;
      when critically ill. Literature is short however concerning the specialized population of&#xD;
      those requiring noninvasive ventilation and they are a high risk group of suffering from&#xD;
      malnutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will potentially benefit patients by improving their nutritional care through&#xD;
      guided assessment and nurse training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use mixed methodology, a prospective cohort study and qualitative interviews.&#xD;
      The prospective cohort study will collect data from patients prior to the tool introduction,&#xD;
      the control group, and post the tool introduction, the exposure group. This will enable&#xD;
      comparisons to be made between the exposure and the control groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses will be interviewed in semi structured focus groups prior to tool introduction and&#xD;
      post to identify themes and sub themes to give a deeper understanding of nutrition in&#xD;
      hospital and to examine the use of the tool in practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be eligible if they are over 18 and requiring noninvasive ventilation and&#xD;
      nurses will be eligible if they work on the high dependency unit. Patients will be visited&#xD;
      daily and have four mid arm circumference measurements at day 1, day 3, day 7 and day 14. The&#xD;
      other daily visits will involve collecting data, which is recorded as part of routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses will undergo 2 focus group interviews and a teaching session. The study will take&#xD;
      place at St Mary's hospital funded by Imperial College London. The study will be split into&#xD;
      two periods with a two week gap in between. Each period will last until 22 patient&#xD;
      participants have been recruited.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      No patients were recruited to the study due to decreased levels of patients requiring&#xD;
      non-invasive ventilation during the study period and time constraints owing to an academic&#xD;
      award submission date. Six nurse participants were recruited to the study and underwent two&#xD;
      focus group interviews, one prior to tool implementation and one post.&#xD;
