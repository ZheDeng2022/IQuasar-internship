  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to obtain long term safety data of ataluren in male&#xD;
      participants with nonsense mutation dystrophinopathy (who participated and completed a&#xD;
      previous Phase 3 study of ataluren [PTC124-GD-020-DMD {NCT01826487}]) to augment the overall&#xD;
      safety database. Screening and baseline procedures are structured to avoid a gap in treatment&#xD;
      between the double-blind study (PTC124-GD-020-DMD) and this extension study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may be further extended by amendment until either ataluren becomes commercially&#xD;
      available or the clinical development of ataluren in duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline (Day 1) up to 6 weeks post-treatment (Week 150)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE): any untoward medical occurrence in a participant who received study drug without regard to possibility of causal relationship. Severity of AEs: graded per Common Terminology Criteria for AEs (CTCAE), Version 3.0 as Grade 1 (mild), 2 (moderate), 3 (severe), 4 (life-threatening), 5 (death). Drug-related AEs: AEs with possible, probable, unlikely relationship, or unrelated to study drug. Serious AEs (SAEs): death, a life-threatening AE, inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, persistent or significant disability or incapacity, a congenital anomaly or birth defect, or an important medical event that jeopardized participant and required medical intervention. TEAE: an AE that occurred or worsened in the period extending from first dose of study drug in this study to 6 weeks after last dose of study drug in this study. A summary of other non-serious AEs and all SAEs, regardless of causality is located in Reported AE section.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Physical Function Total Score as Measured by NSAA at Week 144</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 144</time_frame>
    <description>Physical function was assessed via the NSAA, a functional scale specifically designed for ambulant Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) participants. The assessment comprised tests for 17 abilities of a participant, such as ability to stand, rise from the floor, get from lying to sitting, get from sitting to standing, raise one's head, stand on one's heels, hop, jump, and run. For each activity, a score of 0, 1, or 2 was recorded, with 0 = &quot;unable to achieve independently,&quot; 1 = &quot;modified method but achieves goal independent of physical assistance from another,&quot; or 2 = &quot;normal- achieves goal without any assistance.&quot; The sum of these scores (except for 'raise one's head' activity score) was reported as the ordinal total score, which was transformed to a linear total score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Participants with confirmed loss of ambulation at a particular visit were assigned a score of 0.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in PUL Total Score at Week 144</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 144</time_frame>
    <description>The PUL was used to assess motor performance of the upper limb. The PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into shoulder level (4 items), elbow level (9 items), and distal level (8 items) dimensions. Scoring options per item may not be uniform and may vary from 0-1 and 0-6, according to the performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. Each dimension was scored separately with a maximum score of 16 for shoulder level, 34 for elbow level, and 24 for distal level. Total score was calculated by adding the 3 level scores, with a maximum global score of 74 (total score range = 0-74). Higher score = better outcome.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in PODCI Transfers/Basic Mobility Score at Week 144</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 144</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in health-related quality of life (HRQL) were measured via the PODCI questionnaire that has been shown to correlate with disease progression and clinical outcome measures in DMD. PODCI includes a Global Functioning Scale and 5 core scales: Upper Extremity and Physical Function,Transfer/Basic Mobility, Sports/Physical Functioning, Pain/Comfort,and Happiness. The following PODCI domain was prespecified in the protocol for analysis:Transfers/Basic Mobility domain assesses difficulty experienced in performing routine motor activities in daily life. Each domain was scored from 0 to 100, with 0 representing a poor outcome/worse health, while 100 representing the highest level of functioning and least pain.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Change From Baseline in Activities of Daily Living and Disease Status at Week 144, as Assessed by a Standardized Survey Administered by Site Personnel</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 144</time_frame>
    <description>Changes in activities of daily living and disease symptoms were captured via a DMD-specific survey administered by Site personnel. At screening or baseline, the participant and/or parent/caregiver were asked to identify any activities of daily living (for example, ambulation, balance, personal hygiene/grooming, dressing and undressing, self-feeding, using the bathroom, handwriting, school performance, behavior or energy level) or symptoms that were affected by the participant's DMD. At post-baseline visit (Week 144), the same participant and/or parent/caregiver was asked to describe any changes from baseline in those activities of daily living/symptoms, within the following categories: physical functioning; general energy level; cognition/school function; emotional/social functioning; and sleep. Changes from baseline were reported on a 5-point Likert scale: 1 (much better), 2 (slightly better), 3 (unchanged), 4 (slightly worse), or 5 (much worse).</description>

          <description>NSAA comprised tests of 17 abilities, such as ability to stand, rise from floor, get from lying to sitting, get from sitting to standing, raise one's head, stand on one's heels, hop, jump, and run. For each activity, a score of 0, 1, or 2 was recorded, with 0 = &quot;unable to achieve independently,&quot; 1 = &quot;modified method but achieves goal independent of physical assistance from another,&quot; or 2 = &quot;normal- achieves goal without any assistance.&quot; Sum of these 17 scores was reported as ordinal total score, which can be transformed to a linear total score from 0 (worst) to 100 (best).</description>

          <title>Performance Upper Limb (PUL) Total Score</title>
          <description>PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into shoulder (4 items), elbow (9 items), and distal (8 items) level dimensions. Scoring options per item may vary from 0-1 and 0-6, according to performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. Each dimension was scored separately with a maximum score of 16 for shoulder level, 34 for elbow level, and 24 for distal level. Total score was calculated by adding 3 level scores, with a maximum global score of 74 (total score range = 0-74). Higher score = better outcome.</description>

        <description>Physical function was assessed via the NSAA, a functional scale specifically designed for ambulant Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) participants. The assessment comprised tests for 17 abilities of a participant, such as ability to stand, rise from the floor, get from lying to sitting, get from sitting to standing, raise one's head, stand on one's heels, hop, jump, and run. For each activity, a score of 0, 1, or 2 was recorded, with 0 = &quot;unable to achieve independently,&quot; 1 = &quot;modified method but achieves goal independent of physical assistance from another,&quot; or 2 = &quot;normal- achieves goal without any assistance.&quot; The sum of these scores (except for 'raise one's head' activity score) was reported as the ordinal total score, which was transformed to a linear total score ranging from 0 (worst) to 100 (best). Participants with confirmed loss of ambulation at a particular visit were assigned a score of 0.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in PUL Total Score at Week 144</title>
        <description>The PUL was used to assess motor performance of the upper limb. The PUL scale includes 22 items; an entry item defining the starting functional level, and 21 items subdivided into shoulder level (4 items), elbow level (9 items), and distal level (8 items) dimensions. Scoring options per item may not be uniform and may vary from 0-1 and 0-6, according to the performance, with higher values corresponding to better performance. Each dimension was scored separately with a maximum score of 16 for shoulder level, 34 for elbow level, and 24 for distal level. Total score was calculated by adding the 3 level scores, with a maximum global score of 74 (total score range = 0-74). Higher score = better outcome.</description>

        <description>Changes in activities of daily living and disease symptoms were captured via a DMD-specific survey administered by Site personnel. At screening or baseline, the participant and/or parent/caregiver were asked to identify any activities of daily living (for example, ambulation, balance, personal hygiene/grooming, dressing and undressing, self-feeding, using the bathroom, handwriting, school performance, behavior or energy level) or symptoms that were affected by the participant's DMD. At post-baseline visit (Week 144), the same participant and/or parent/caregiver was asked to describe any changes from baseline in those activities of daily living/symptoms, within the following categories: physical functioning; general energy level; cognition/school function; emotional/social functioning; and sleep. Changes from baseline were reported on a 5-point Likert scale: 1 (much better), 2 (slightly better), 3 (unchanged), 4 (slightly worse), or 5 (much worse).</description>
