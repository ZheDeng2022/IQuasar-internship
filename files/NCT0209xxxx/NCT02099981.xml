    <textblock>
      Diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world. The causes of&#xD;
      the disease are poorly understood. One of the earliest changes that occur in the retinas of&#xD;
      diabetic patients, well before overt retinopathy is observed, is a reduction in light-evoked&#xD;
      increases in blood flow in retinal vessels. The loss of this vascular response may lead to&#xD;
      retinal hypoxia and it has been suggested that hypoxia could be a principal cause of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goals of this project are to determine whether decreased blood flow in diabetic&#xD;
      patients and the resulting retinal hypoxia contributes to the development of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy and whether restoration of normal blood flow in diabetic patients slows or&#xD;
      prevents the development of retinopathy.&#xD;

      The immediate goal of the proposed project is to determine whether administration of&#xD;
      aminoguanidine (AG) restores light--evoked vasodilations in the retinas of patients without&#xD;
      advanced retinopathy. We will also determine whether AG improves contrast sensitivity in&#xD;
      diabetic patients. The proposed experiments are as a first step in developing new therapies&#xD;
      to prevent diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be asked to come to the University of Minnesota on three (3)&#xD;
      occasions (the visits will last for up to 2, 5 and 3 hours respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1. During the screening visit (first and shortest visit), consent will be obtained and&#xD;
      baseline labs collected (Hemoglobin A1c and Creatinine). Demographic information (date of&#xD;
      birth, gender, race), subjects characteristics (weight, height, blood pressure and pulse) and&#xD;
      relevant medical history will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2. Vessel dilation testing: Control and diabetic subjects will present to the&#xD;
      Ophthalmology Research Unit at the University of Minnesota. Prior to the imaging examination,&#xD;
      each subject will receive dilating eye drops (1% Tropicamide) to prevent accommodation of the&#xD;
      pupil and brief eye exam will be performed. Measurement of resting vessel diameter and&#xD;
      light--evoked vessel dilation will be made using the Imedos Systems &quot;Dynamic Vessel&#xD;
      Analyzer&quot;. Subjects will be instructed to look at a fixation spot and a 350 s sequence of&#xD;
      fundus images will be acquired during baseline and stimulation period. After completion of&#xD;
      the initial vasodilation measurements, both control and diabetic subjects will be given 150&#xD;
      mg AG orally and measurement of resting vessel diameter and light--evoked vasodilation will&#xD;
      be repeated 90 minutes later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3. Contrast sensitivity testing: Contrast sensitivity will be assessed in un-dilated&#xD;
      control and diabetic subjects. Contrast sensitivity will be determined both before and after&#xD;
      AG administration using a CSV-100 test chart (VectorVision) and will be measured at 3, 6, 12,&#xD;
      and 18 cycles per degree.&#xD;
