  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind, parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      multiple-ascending oral dose study to investigate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics,&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamics of ACT-389949 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability following once a day oral&#xD;
      dosing of ACT-389949 for 9 days and investigate ACT-389949 pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of ACT-389949 following a&#xD;
      maximum of two different oral dosing regimens: ACT-389949 given either every 3 days for 13&#xD;
      days or every 2 days for 9 days (5 doses for each regimen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C of the study, if required, will provide additional information to that obtained from&#xD;
      Parts A and B in terms of safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      ACT-389949.&#xD;
