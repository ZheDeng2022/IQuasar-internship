  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) is a major obstetric problem, affecting 1.46 million fetuses&#xD;
      worldwide each year and contributing to 50% of stillbirths. Severe early onset FGR affects 1&#xD;
      in 500 pregnancies, leading to stillbirth or the need for delivery before 28 weeks gestation.&#xD;
      The combination of FGR and prematurity is associated with a significant risk of neonatal&#xD;
      mortality and short and long-term complications. Even modest increases in birthweight (e.g&#xD;
      from 500 to 600g) and gestation at delivery (e.g from 26 to 27 weeks) are associated with&#xD;
      significantly better outcomes but there are currently no treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EVERREST Clinical Trial, funded by the European Commission, aims to develop a treatment&#xD;
      which will increase fetal growth in severe early onset FGR. It will use gene therapy injected&#xD;
      into the uterine arteries of the mother to increase the levels of vascular endothelial growth&#xD;
      factor (VEGF) and so increase uterine artery blood flow and fetal growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EVERREST prospective study aims to form a clinical database and biobank of pregnancies&#xD;
      affected by severe early onset FGR to improve understanding of the condition and serve as a&#xD;
      comparison to assess the safety and efficacy of this intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prospective study will take place across four European centers who will later take part&#xD;
      in the EVERREST Clinical Trial. Women with singleton fetuses with early onset FGR will be&#xD;
      approached to take part in the study. Participating women will provide blood samples, details&#xD;
      of their clinical condition, samples of umbilical cord blood, placenta and myometrial and&#xD;
      placental bed biopsies at the time of Caesarean section (if needed). Data on short and&#xD;
      long-term outcomes of the babies will be collected. All data will be entered onto a central&#xD;
      database for eventual use as a comparator for treated women on the EVERREST Clinical Trial,&#xD;
      for which separate ethical approval will be sought.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fetal Growth Restriction (FGR) is a major obstetric problem, affecting 1.46 million fetuses&#xD;
      worldwide each year and contributing to 50% of stillbirths. Severe early onset FGR affects 1&#xD;
      in 500 pregnancies, leading to stillbirth or the need for delivery before 28 weeks gestation.&#xD;
      The EVERREST prospective study plans to clinically and biochemically characterise a cohort of&#xD;
      pregnancies affected by severe early onset FGR across the four European centres. A database&#xD;
      will be created containing information about antenatal investigations, maternal&#xD;
      complications, fetal outcome and neonatal progress. This will be linked to a biobank&#xD;
      containing samples of maternal blood, umbilical cord, umbilical cord blood, placenta,&#xD;
      placental bed and myometrium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three aims to this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To provide data from pregnancies affected by severe early onset FGR with which to&#xD;
           compare outcomes from a group of pregnancies that will undergo treatment using maternal&#xD;
           Ad.VEGF gene therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To provide important information about the likely prognosis for babies born after&#xD;
           affected pregnancies in the short and long term. These are data which are currently&#xD;
           lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To provide samples that will be used to investigate the biological mechanisms that&#xD;
           underlie the condition, which subsequently may be used to provide biomarkers of outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the project has involved consultation with leading European fetal medicine&#xD;
      specialists, neonatologists, pathologists and biomedical scientists who form part of the&#xD;
      EVERREST consortium. The multicenter nature of the project raises issues of confidentiality&#xD;
      and data protection but also allows for a larger data set from which to draw more meaningful&#xD;
      conclusions. Furthermore it means that the findings are applicable not just in the United&#xD;
      Kingdom but also in Europe. It also provides a larger group of patients from which to recruit&#xD;
      to the EVERREST trial. The project has also been given approval by the National Institute for&#xD;
      Health Research, funded Fetal Medicine Clinical Study Group at the Royal College of&#xD;
      Obstetrician and Gynecologists, of which the PI is a member. Other leading Fetal Medicine&#xD;
      centres across the United Kingdom will be involved in recruiting to the prospective study so&#xD;
      that a wider picture of severe FGR and samples from affected pregnancies are available in the&#xD;
      UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Women referred to the Fetal Medicine Unit for suspected severe early onset Fetal&#xD;
      Growth Restriction will be given a Participant Information Sheet (PIS) to read. If the&#xD;
      diagnosis of severe early onset FGR is made women will be asked if they are interested in&#xD;
      taking part in the study. Interested eligible women will meet with a member of the research&#xD;
      team who will read through the PIS with them and answer any questions they have. If the woman&#xD;
      would like more time to decide they can meet with a member of the research team at a&#xD;
      subsequent hospital appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks, burdens and benefits Women may be distressed by discussing the study at what will&#xD;
      already be a worrying and upsetting time following the diagnosis of severe early onset FGR.&#xD;
      If this is the case it will not be pursued, and can be discussed at a future appointment if&#xD;
      the woman wishes. Within the University College London Hospital Fetal Medicine Unit women are&#xD;
      frequently given information about research at the time of their appointments and the&#xD;
      investigators have not found this to be distressing to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women may be concerned that declining to be involved in the study will affect the care that&#xD;
      they receive. The Participant Information Sheet will make it clear that this will not be the&#xD;
      case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a risk of breach of confidentiality with data sharing. This will be minimised by&#xD;
      holding data in a central secure database, which will be password protected and can only be&#xD;
      accessed by authorised members of the team, and by creating a unique pseudoanonymised&#xD;
      Participant Identification Number which will be used on the database. Participant&#xD;
      identifiable data, including name, address and hospital ID number, will not be entered onto&#xD;
      the central database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Performing the ultrasound assessments of uterine artery blood flow will add 2-5 minutes to a&#xD;
      30 minute ultrasound scan. At these appointments women will often need to wait for their&#xD;
      ultrasound scan and may need blood pressure monitoring, urine checks and fetal heart beat&#xD;
      monitoring (cardiotocograph) as part of their routine care. This can mean they are at the&#xD;
      hospital for an hour or more, or which the uterine blood flow assessment would be a small&#xD;
      fraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maternal blood samples may involve temporary pain and/or bruising. This will be minimised&#xD;
      by having the samples taken by trained healthcare professionals. During a low risk pregnancy&#xD;
      two routine blood samples are recommended at booking and 28 weeks gestation. In pregnancies&#xD;
      complicated by severe early onset FGR several additional blood samples will be needed as part&#xD;
      of clinical care. Investigators plan to take the investigators first sample at the same time&#xD;
      as blood tests needed to look for maternal infections (toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus,&#xD;
      rubella) and the investigators second at the same time as pre-operative blood tests taken&#xD;
      before Caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The myometrial biopsy and placental bed biopsy will each add an estimated 1 minute to the&#xD;
      Caesarean section. Generally the surgical time for a Caesarean is about 45 minutes but when&#xD;
      anesthetic time and patient transfer are included the overall procedure takes approximately 2&#xD;
      hours. They are not associated with a significant risk of hemorrhage or post-operative&#xD;
      complications. Biopsies would not be taken if there were a clinical contra-indication e.g.&#xD;
      excessive uterine bleeding or maternal medical conditions meaning the duration of the surgery&#xD;
      had to be limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The umbilical cord, umbilical cord blood and placental samples will be taken after the baby&#xD;
      has been delivered, the cord cut and the placenta delivered so will not involve any pain or&#xD;
      inconvenience for the mother or baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the moment there is no treatment for severe early onset FGR. This can leave parents&#xD;
      feeling helpless in the face of the diagnosis. It may help them to feel their participation&#xD;
      could contribute to a better understanding of the condition and a potential treatment in the&#xD;
      future. Women who have a pregnancy affected by severe early onset FGR are at higher risk of&#xD;
      having a future affected pregnancy, so there may also be the potential for a direct benefit&#xD;
      to their future reproductive health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Babies born from pregnancies affected by severe early onset FGR are routinely followed up in&#xD;
      all four EU countries to two years of age, corrected for prematurity, since it is well known&#xD;
      that many have severe morbidity for which medical input is required. Investigators will&#xD;
      collect data about clinical blood results, investigations and neurodevelopmental assessments,&#xD;
      which are performed routinely as part of their standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality The EVERREST consortium will be collecting demographic and clinical data&#xD;
      about participants from four European countries which will be combined in a central database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within each centre participants will be given a unique study Participant Identification&#xD;
      Number (PIN). Data will be entered under this identification number onto the central database&#xD;
      stored on the servers based at the University College London. The database will be password&#xD;
      protected and only accessible to members of the EVERREST Consortium, UCL Clinical Trials&#xD;
      Unit, the participating hospitals and external regulators, including the European Commission.&#xD;
      The servers are protected by firewalls and are patched and maintained according to best&#xD;
      practice. The physical location of the servers is protected by Closed-circuit television and&#xD;
      security door access. The database and coding frames will be developed by the Trial Manager&#xD;
      in conjunction with the CTU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The information linking participant identifiable data to the pseudoanonymised Participant&#xD;
      Identification Number will be held locally by the research sites. This will either be held in&#xD;
      written form in a locked filing cabinet or electronically in password protected form on&#xD;
      hospital computers. After completion of the study the data linking participant identifiable&#xD;
      data to the PIN will be destroyed and the database will be retained on the servers of&#xD;
      University College London for on-going analysis in conjunction with the bio bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All members of the research team will receive training in the regulations surrounding&#xD;
      confidentiality and data handling and their responsibilities in this area. It will be made&#xD;
      clear to participants in the PIS and during the process of consent that data will be obtained&#xD;
      from their medical records and the medical records of their baby. It will be explained that&#xD;
      this data will be stored in a form in which they are not directly identifiable and will be&#xD;
      shared within the European Union for the purposes of the study. Electronic data will be&#xD;
      transferred in encrypted and password protected form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not anticipated that the results of analysing the tissue samples will have any direct&#xD;
      clinical significance for the participants. If, however, results were to be obtained which&#xD;
      would have a serious impact on the participant's current or future health these would be fed&#xD;
      back to the recruiting study centre under the Participant Identification Number. Within the&#xD;
      recruiting centre the results could be linked back to the participant without them being&#xD;
      identified to the rest of the research team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of tissue samples in future research At the conclusion of the study, stored samples will&#xD;
      be transferred to a site with national regulatory approval, for retention as a bio bank.&#xD;
      Participant consent will be obtained in advance for this retention. Separate ethical&#xD;
      application will be made for research using these samples. Samples will be stored until they&#xD;
      are fully used or become unusable, which is anticipated to be a maximum of 10 years for&#xD;
      frozen samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants do not give their consent for retention for future research then UK samples&#xD;
      will be disposed of in accordance with the Human Tissue Authority's Code of Practice and&#xD;
      European samples will be disposed of according to local and national guidelines.&#xD;
