  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted to compare two alternative techniques for dental implant&#xD;
      placement. Both of the techniques - Osteotome and Conventional Drilling Techniques for the&#xD;
      preparation of the implant sites (osteotomies) are accepted standards of care. The goal of&#xD;
      the study will be to compare implant stabilities achieved with two techniques by measuring&#xD;
      resonance frequency for each implant placed using the diagnostic device, the Osstell machine,&#xD;
      that measures &quot;stiffness&quot; of the bone/implant system non-invasively. The data are represented&#xD;
      in a quantitative value - implant stability quotient (ISQ), where a higher value indicated a&#xD;
      higher implant stability. Since it has been well documented in the scientific literature that&#xD;
      primary (at the time of implant placement) implant stability is a strong prerequisite for&#xD;
      implant success (osseointegration and subsequent function on loading), the results of this&#xD;
      study will guide the implant team in choosing the right surgical treatment protocol - the&#xD;
      protocol that will be aimed for higher implant stability, and, therefore, for higher&#xD;
      long-term implant success.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With the emergence of one stage surgical approach to implant placements with immediate&#xD;
      loading (IL), the importance of achieving uncompromised primary stability, especially in poor&#xD;
      bone density (D3, D4), cannot be underestimated. Degidi et al. showed that poor quality bone&#xD;
      was related to increased marginal bone loss and inferior clinical outcomes for IL implants.&#xD;
      In a 5 year retrospective study, Elkhoury et al. found that one of the significant clinical&#xD;
      parameters, associated with success of plasma-sprayed cylindrical dental implants was higher&#xD;
      bone density (P&lt;0.0001). Hermann et al evaluated 487 implants randomly selected from a&#xD;
      research created database that used different implant placements protocols placed over a 5&#xD;
      year period and found out that implant failures were primarily associated with negative&#xD;
      bone-related patient factors: jawbone quality and shape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two bone types that fall in the negative bone-related factors are types D3 and D4. D3 type&#xD;
      bone, which consists of thin porous cortical and fine trabecular bone, according to the Misch&#xD;
      bone density classification, is most prevalent in anterior maxilla and posterior regions of&#xD;
      maxilla and mandible. In a review of 73 published articles, by Esposito et al., biological&#xD;
      factors that contribute to failures of osseointegrated oral implants, the authors confirmed&#xD;
      that maxillas, due to their poor bone density, have almost 3 times more implant failures than&#xD;
      mandibles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In planning the case, it is very important to differentiate between bone quality and bone&#xD;
      density. Bone quality comprises bone metabolism, cell turn over, mineralization, maturation,&#xD;
      intercellular matrix, and vascularization and while all of these factors influence implant&#xD;
      success, it is valuable to be able to isolate them in order to be able to investigate their&#xD;
      individual contributions to implant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of three-dimensional imaging, such as Computed Tomography (CT) and Cone Beam&#xD;
      Computed Tomography (CBCT) has recently became the standard of care during pre-surgical&#xD;
      phase, at implant planning stage. It enables an implant team to provide the most precise and&#xD;
      reliable diagnostic information on the patient's vital anatomy, bone quality and bone&#xD;
      quantity at the proposed implant sites. In 95% of cases that use CT, bone quantity&#xD;
      determination is to +/- 1 mm of accuracy, compared to only 30% of cases that use panoramic&#xD;
      radiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comprehensive review of 45 manuscripts by Molly that investigated and discussed the&#xD;
      relationship between bone density and primary implant stability concluded that there is a&#xD;
      significant correlation exists between bone density, primary stability, and implant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the necessary, although not sufficient, determinants of implant success is successful&#xD;
      osseointegration, which was defined by Albrektsson as a &quot;direct functional and structural&#xD;
      connection between living bone and the surface of a load-bearing implant&quot;. However,&#xD;
      non-invasive determination of the degree of osseointegration is not yet possible in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Therefore, assessments of primary and secondary implant stability could indirectly&#xD;
      provide clinicians with the degree of future and present osseointegration, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stability of an implant can be defined as &quot;its capacity to withstand loading forces in axial,&#xD;
      lateral, and rotational directions&quot;. It can be subdivided into &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot;.&#xD;
      Primary stability has been coined by Branemark as a prerequisite to achieve osseointegration&#xD;
      (Branemark et al. 1977). It is the stability of an implant body that is achieved during&#xD;
      implant installation by the physical congruence between the surgically created bone bed&#xD;
      (osteotomy) and the implant, which depends on surgical technique, bone density, and&#xD;
      macroscopic implant design. It also can serve as a predictor of future osseointegration.&#xD;
      Secondary implant stability is the stability that is gradually achieved after&#xD;
      osseointegration of an implant, and is highly correlated with bone to implant contact surface&#xD;
      area, depending on microscopic implant design since the bone is being formed inside implants&#xD;
      threads.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to provide objective measurements of primary or second implant stabilities,&#xD;
      resonance-frequency analysis (RFA) has been introduced. In addition to providing quantitative&#xD;
      information about the degree of primary implant stability, it is also useful to monitor&#xD;
      implant osseointegration during the healing phase in order to help establish individual&#xD;
      loading time protocols. Nedir et al., evaluated predictability of osseointegration as&#xD;
      measured by RFA, which quantitates the implant stability, and the authors suggested that&#xD;
      implants with ISQ&gt;49 should osseointegrate predictably, when left submerged to heal for 3&#xD;
      months, and implants with ISQ&gt;54 might be immediately loaded. Rodrigo et al., used clinical&#xD;
      evaluation and RFA measurements to diagnose implant stability and its impact on implant&#xD;
      survival and concluded that only secondary stability RFA values were good predictors of&#xD;
      implant outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the classical surgical protocols in the posterior maxilla is the osteotome technique&#xD;
      that was introduced by Summers in 1997 in order to be able to take advantage of the poor bone&#xD;
      quality by relocating the available bone to accommodate the needs of the surgical procedure.&#xD;
      Since the implants were placed without drilling, it was meant to be an essentially &quot;heatless&quot;&#xD;
      procedure that compacted the bone adjacent to the prepared osteotomy, thus, improving&#xD;
      &quot;osseointegration&quot;. Since then, the procedure has become successfully established as a&#xD;
      surgical routine, but it has mostly been used in cases where either ridge expansion, or&#xD;
      internal sinus elevation is needed. It is crucial to point out that only divergent osteotomes&#xD;
      will be able to compact the bone laterally without crushing the bone and that since the&#xD;
      technique in itself provides bone compaction immediately adjacent to the implant site, it&#xD;
      might be beneficial to utilize osteotomes in implant protocols even when sinus elevation or&#xD;
      ridge augmentation are not necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pjetursson et al. utilized osteotome technique and in their study more than 90% of patients&#xD;
      were satisfied with the treatment and reported that they would undergo the same procedure&#xD;
      again and recommend it to their family members or friends, thus, demonstrating that osteotome&#xD;
      technique has perfect patient acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present human case control study the investigators will compare the ISQ values of&#xD;
      maxillary implants placed using the osteotome technique, described by Drew et al. and&#xD;
      conventional drilling techniques. Our hypothesis is that due to the divergent design of the&#xD;
      osteotomes, bone quality will be improved, therefore, improving bone-to-implant contact&#xD;
      ratio, which will be illustrated by higher ISQ values in the osteotome group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary implant stability, measured by resonance frequency analysis (RFA) at the time of&#xD;
           implant placement is higher in the implants placed with the osteotomes (O Group) vs.&#xD;
           conventional drilling (D group) (ISQprimary (O) &gt; ISQprimary (D)).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary implant stability, measured by resonance frequency analysis (RFA) at 30, 60,&#xD;
           and 90 days, is higher in the implants placed with the osteotomes vs. conventional&#xD;
           drilling (ISQsecondary (O) &gt; ISQsecondary (D)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have 1 implant fixtures Biomet 3 I Osseotite Certain Prevail (same diameter and&#xD;
      length: 4x10 mm) placed in the maxilla (upper jaw) by randomly assigned two experienced&#xD;
      surgeons. Randomization will be done so that the surgeon will place implants in randomly&#xD;
      assigned patients (half implants using Osteotome technique and half implants using Drilling&#xD;
      technique). Fixtures will be randomly assigned to either Osteotome (O) or Conventional&#xD;
      Drilling (D) group using a randomization plan developed online from www.randomization.com.&#xD;
      Healing abutments (2 mm supragingivally) will be placed if the primary stability will be&#xD;
      attained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In cases, RFA measurement is less than 49 ISQ, the implants will be submerged and the second&#xD;
      measurement will be done after implant uncovery at 90 days. All subjects will have completed&#xD;
      Phase I therapy (non-surgical) with no active periodontal disease and/or caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A diagnostic wax up will be made for each case and a clear radiographic/surgical template&#xD;
      fabricated for three-dimensional analysis and implant placement surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone Beam CT scans (ICATvision® software and ICAT Next Generation® machine, Hatfield, PA) as&#xD;
      an accepted standard of care, will be done prior to surgery to plan the surgery and to&#xD;
      confirm the bone density of type D3 or type D 4 (D 1 and D 2 will be excluded from the study)&#xD;
      in Hounsfield units (H.U.). The accepted bone density values and their corresponding bone&#xD;
      quality when a medical CT scanning is used are as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D 1 Bone (&gt; 1250 H.U.) D 2 Bone (850-1250 H.U.) D 3 Bone (350-850 H.U.) D 4 Bone (&lt; 400 H.U.)&#xD;
      The imaging will verify that adequate horizontal and vertical dimensions of bone are present,&#xD;
      prior to surgery. A minimum of 7mm of horizontal bone and a minimum of 12 mm of vertical&#xD;
      height will be needed to accommodate a 4x10mm fixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local Anesthesia of 2% Lidocaine with 1:100000epi or 3% Carbocaine without vasoconstrictor&#xD;
      buccal and palatal infiltration. Mid-crestal, intra-sulcular incisions extending to one tooth&#xD;
      mesial and distal to the surgery site. Full thickness flap reflection. Osteotome group&#xD;
      fixtures (O) will be placed according to the technique described by Drew et al. Conventional&#xD;
      drilling technique Fixtures will be placed according Biomet 3 I surgical protocol. Final&#xD;
      insertion torque of each implant will be recorded in 20, 32, or 45 Ncm by the Biomet 3 I&#xD;
      machine, which is utilized for perforation of bone and implant placement. It can only apply&#xD;
      finite amount of torque in order to avoid damage to the alveolar bone due to overheating.&#xD;
      Healing caps 2 mm supragingivally placed and ISQ values recorded using Osstell device. (If&#xD;
      ISQ &lt; 49, the implants will be submerged, and left to osseointegrate for 90 days. Only 0 and&#xD;
      90 days recording will be made). 4-0 Vicryl suture will be used to obtain primary closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All fixtures will be placed at 20, 32, or 45 Ncm torque. ISQ values will be recorded by&#xD;
      Osstell device at the time of implant placement (0) and at 30. 60, and 90 days. Each ISQ&#xD;
      measurement will be repeated twice with two different transducers and the mean ISQ value will&#xD;
      be used for the analysis. The transducer will be screwed manually and the measurement device&#xD;
      will be directed perpendicularly to the direction of the fixture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical parameters that will be recorded at 0, 30, 60, and 90 days:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A. Resonance frequency measurements of each implant. B. Final torque Measurements of each&#xD;
      implant in Ncm. Soft tissue height (mesio-buccal (MB), buccal(B), disto-buccal(DB),&#xD;
      mesio-palatal(MP), palatal(P), disto-palatal (DP)) (measured from the gingival margin to the&#xD;
      depth of the pocket). Soft tissue levels measured at MB, B, DB, P, (measured from the soft&#xD;
      tissue margin to the mark on the occlusal stent) at 0 and 90 days only. Crestal bone area&#xD;
      (bitewing conventional radiography with customized intraoral X ray film holders) All cases&#xD;
      will be done with antibiotic premedication (Amoxicillin 2000mg or Zithromax 500mg, 1 hour&#xD;
      prior to surgery). Post-op instructions will include Chlorhexidine gluconate 0.15% mouthwash&#xD;
      BID for 21 days, pain control medication and an antibiotic. Patients that will develop&#xD;
      complications (infection, loss of implant etc…) will be followed up and treated in accordance&#xD;
      to the established standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the event of mobility the implant will be removed and the site grafted, and implant&#xD;
      replaced in 3-6 months at no charge to patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed using Two-sample T-test.&#xD;
