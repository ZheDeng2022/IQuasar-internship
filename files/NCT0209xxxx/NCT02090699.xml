  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cardiac failure is the major cause of death in patients with thalassemia and chronic blood&#xD;
      transfusion-related iron overload. The treatment of thalassemia has been revolutionized over&#xD;
      the past decade with the implementation of cardiac MRI based assessment of iron overload.&#xD;
      This has enabled detection of cardiac iron overload prior to symptomatic heart failure and&#xD;
      now allows for timely therapy which has resulted in a substantial decrease in mortality.&#xD;
      However, currently implemented MR imaging techniques assess for iron content only and not for&#xD;
      iron related diffuse fibrosis which play a role in iron related heart failure.&#xD;
      Histopathologic studies indicate that patients with iron overload have diffuse interstitial&#xD;
      fibrosis. Quantitative MR techniques have shown that patients with various cardiomyopathies&#xD;
      demonstrate diffuse myocardial fibrosis and that these changes correlate with changes in&#xD;
      cardiac function. The investigators propose that quantitative cardiac MRI for assessment of&#xD;
      diffuse myocardial fibrosis can further improve our ability to detect early damage to the&#xD;
      myocardium and prevent morbidity and mortality from cardiac iron overload. Detection of&#xD;
      fibrosis in patients with thalassemia may allow for earlier identification of cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      when compared to other techniques in clinical use including T2* analysis. Identification of&#xD;
      fibrosis could affect patient management as it would allow for tailoring of iron chelation&#xD;
      therapy and may lead to better understanding of the disease processes contributing to heart&#xD;
      failure and arrhythmia in these patients.&#xD;

      Cardiac failure is the major cause of death in patients with transfusion-related iron&#xD;
      overload. Histopathologic studies indicate that patients with myocardial siderosis have&#xD;
      diffuse interstitial fibrosis. Cardiac MR assessment of the extracellular volume (ECV)&#xD;
      fraction in other disease processes has been shown to accurately characterize diffuse&#xD;
      myocardial fibrosis and to correlate with changes in diastolic function. No prior studies&#xD;
      have assessed for diffuse interstitial myocardial fibrosis in patients with iron overload&#xD;
      utilizing the proposed imaging techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will assess the presence and extent of interstitial fibrosis&#xD;
      in patients with transfusion-dependent anemias using cardiac MR techniques of T1 mapping and&#xD;
      determination of ECV fraction. ECV values will be correlated with the severity of myocardial&#xD;
      iron deposition determined by multi-echo T2*-weighted imaging, systolic ventricular function&#xD;
      as determined by cardiac MR and diastolic function assessed by echocardiography. The&#xD;
      investigators will recruit 35 patients with transfusion-related iron overload. Ten&#xD;
      age-matched healthy subjects will be included as controls, to establish baseline values of&#xD;
      myocardial T1 and ECV values. A modified Look-Locker with inversion recovery (MOLLI) sequence&#xD;
      will be used to determine T1 values pre-, and post-administration of a gadolinium-based&#xD;
      contrast agent (GBCA) at 1.5 Tesla. Calculated ECV values will be compared between&#xD;
      iron-overload subjects and healthy controls, and will be correlated with left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction, measures of diastolic dysfunction and T2* values.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection of myocardial fibrosis in patients with iron overload would allow for improved&#xD;
      prognostication and risk stratification. Elucidation of the relationship between myocardial&#xD;
      fibrosis and myocardial iron deposition as well as cardiac functional parameters would&#xD;
      provide valuable mechanistic insights and improved pathophysiological understanding of the&#xD;
      disease. The results of the proposed study have the potential to significantly impact patient&#xD;
      management including recommendations for earlier or more aggressive chelation therapy based&#xD;
      on changes in ECV values.&#xD;
