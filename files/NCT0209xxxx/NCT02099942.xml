      This registry is designed to monitor the real world clinical performance and safety of the V8&#xD;
      device used to perform balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV). Additional analyses or&#xD;
      calculations may be obtained from the imaging or evaluations already performed per the sites'&#xD;
      standard of care&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label observational study involving a minimum of 10 centers. A minimum&#xD;
      of 100 patients, including a minimum of 30 stand-alone balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV)&#xD;
      treatment patients, will be enrolled. Enrollment will continue until all 3 of these&#xD;
      conditions are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BAV-only patients will be followed through a 6-month post-treatment telephone follow up.&#xD;
      Patients treated with the V8 device for BAV as a bridge to transcatheter aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement (TAVR) or surgical aortic valve replacement (SAVR) or as an intraprocedural&#xD;
      predilatation prior to TAVR, will exit the study at the time of the TAVR or SAVR implant or&#xD;
      at 6 months post-BAV treatment, whichever comes first.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patient has undergone previous AVR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Greater or equal to 3+ aortic insufficiency by echocardiogram obtained prior to&#xD;
             planned BAV or intra-procedural predilation TAVR procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-valvular AS&#xD;
&#xD;
