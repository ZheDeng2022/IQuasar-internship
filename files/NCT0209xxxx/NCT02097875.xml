  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many types of cancer are primarily treated with surgery and patient survival is directly&#xD;
      related to the extent to which the tumor is able to be removed. It is often difficult for&#xD;
      surgeons to distinguish tumor tissue from normal tissue or to detect tumor cells that have&#xD;
      spread from the original tumor site, resulting in incomplete removal of the tumor and reduced&#xD;
      patient survival. In addition, in some sites, such as the brain, it is critical to avoid&#xD;
      damage to normal tissue around the tumor to prevent adverse effects of surgery on function.&#xD;
      We hypothesize that BLZ-100 will improve surgical outcomes by allowing surgeons to visualize&#xD;
      the edges of the tumor and small groups of cancer cells that have spread to other sites in&#xD;
      real-time, as they operate.&#xD;
