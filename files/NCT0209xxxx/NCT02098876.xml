      Stents are metallic tubular supports placed inside a blood vessel to relieve an obstruction&#xD;
      and restore blood flow to the heart muscle. Stents could also be coated with a drug&#xD;
      (drug-eluting stents - DES) that improves local healing and inhibits growth of scar tissue&#xD;
      within the vessel that otherwise could lead to re-narrowing. This study will evaluate the&#xD;
      effects of 2 FDA-approved metallic stents with different designs that may have important&#xD;
      effects on regional plaque response and blood flow dynamics immediately after stent&#xD;
      deployment and stent healing at 12 months follow up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The past two decades have registered major advances in cardiovascular medicine that have&#xD;
      improved patients' survival and quality of life. One area of major research and innovation is&#xD;
      the field of percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI), a non-surgical procedure used to&#xD;
      treat a narrowed heart artery with stents. Stents are metallic tubular supports placed inside&#xD;
      a blood vessel to relieve an obstruction and restore blood flow to the heart muscle. Stents&#xD;
      could also be coated with a drug (drug-eluting stents - DES) that improves local healing and&#xD;
      inhibits growth of scar tissue (smooth muscle and fibrous cells) within the vessel that&#xD;
      otherwise could lead to re-narrowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators study will evaluate two FDA-approved DES, currently in use, with respect to&#xD;
      coronary vessel healing and long term patency. These include the XIENCE Xpedition Everolimus&#xD;
      drug-eluting stent (X-EES) from Abbott Vascular and Resolute Integrity® Zotarolimus&#xD;
      drug-eluting stent (R-ZES) from Medtronic, Inc, both of which have been shown in large&#xD;
      clinical trials to be safe and effective. This study will evaluate the effects of apparently&#xD;
      subtle differences in stent design between these two platforms that may have important&#xD;
      effects on regional plaque response and blood flow dynamics immediately after stent&#xD;
      deployment and stent healing and scar formation at 12 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several aspect of the R-ZES compared to the X-EES design may result in more favorable&#xD;
      regional plaque response and blood flow dynamics immediately after stent deployment. These&#xD;
      include a more compliant stent design made of a single sinusoidal wire with no connector&#xD;
      between struts that is likely to be more comformable to a curved or angulated coronary&#xD;
      vessels. In heart vessels which are not angulated, these features may not make a major&#xD;
      difference in outcomes as studies already suggest. Whereas, in narrowed arteries which are&#xD;
      curved or angulated, the use of X-EES could result in more straightening of the vessel's&#xD;
      natural curvature and more disturbance in flow patterns. In contrast, the use of R-ZES in&#xD;
      angulated arteries could cause less hemodynamic disturbances. There is a great deal of data&#xD;
      suggesting that disturbances in local blood flow patterns and creation of eddy currents&#xD;
      ('turbulent' blood flow) could adversely affect stent healing and exacerbate neointimal&#xD;
      tissue growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using two intravascular imaging technologies, the optical coherence tomography (OCT) and&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS), this study aims to investigate differences in scar tissue&#xD;
      coverage within the stented region and the degree of narrowing at the edges of the stent in&#xD;
      patients undergoing clinically-indicated PCI (with R-ZES and X-EES) at 12-month follow-up.&#xD;
