    <textblock>
      Based on the efficacy of inulin and oligofructose in treating experimental colitis and&#xD;
      emerging evidence suggesting probiotics are efficacious in maintaining and inducing remission&#xD;
      in human ulcerative colitis (UC), the investigators intend to conduct an open label study&#xD;
      using Synergy-1, a 1:1 oligosaccharide/ inulin mixture, in patients with mild to moderately&#xD;
      active left-sided UC. The investigators hypothesize that oligofructose-enriched inulin&#xD;
      (Synergy-1) can be used safely in the treatment of mild to moderate UC, and daily oral&#xD;
      administration of Synergy-1 will result in the clinical improvement and/ or remission of&#xD;
      disease. Subjects will be randomized to either a 7.5g or 15g dose of Synergy-1 in order to&#xD;
      investigate what amount of the prebiotic is efficacious and tolerable in patients with active&#xD;
      UC. The clinical activity of disease will be evaluated using endoscopy and symptom scores.&#xD;
      The investigators will also study the effect Synergy-1 on mucosal histology, intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota composition and function and markers of inflammation (e.g. fecal calprotectin,&#xD;
      cytokines). The study will be for 9 weeks from baseline wherein all subjects will receive&#xD;
      Synergy-1 treatment. Half the subjects will receive a dose of 7.5g and half will receive 15g&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a chronic inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) of the colon which&#xD;
      manifests as mucosal inflammation and ulceration. The disease affects various lengths of the&#xD;
      colon. It cycles through periods of symptomatic relapse and asymptomatic remission. During&#xD;
      relapse, patients suffer from frequent passage of watery diarrhea which may contain blood and&#xD;
      mucous. Currently pharmacological treatments of mild to moderate UC consist of 5 amino&#xD;
      salicylic acid (5 ASA), corticosteroids, and immunosuppressive agents such as azathioprine&#xD;
      (Imuran), its metabolite 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) and cyclosporine. Although 5-ASA medications&#xD;
      are well-tolerated and relatively safe, systematic reviews have shown that they are&#xD;
      successful in inducing remission in 50% of patients. Systemic corticosteroids and&#xD;
      immunosuppressive such as cyclosporine, azathioprine and 6-MP have considerable toxicity&#xD;
      which can limit their use in some patients. Therefore alternatives to the current standard&#xD;
      therapy are in search.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pathogenesis of UC is thought to be due to a combination of genetic, environmental and&#xD;
      immunological factors. Several studies have shown that among the environmental factors,&#xD;
      commensal intestinal bacteria play an important role in the etiology of UC. Patients with UC&#xD;
      demonstrate a general increase in bacterial mucosal adherence and inter-epithelial cell&#xD;
      penetration. Mucosal biopsies from UC showed increased concentrations of potentially&#xD;
      pathogenic strains of enterobacteria (Escherichia coli group), Bacteroides and Clostridium&#xD;
      species, and a relative decrease in protective organisms such as Faecalibacterium and&#xD;
      Bifidobacteria, as compared to healthy individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the search for treatments of UC that have a direct influence on bacterial factors, efforts&#xD;
      have been directed at altering the composition of the intestinal microflora to favour more&#xD;
      protective organisms such as Lactobacilli and Bifidobacteria, also called probiotic bacteria.&#xD;
      Several probiotic formulas (VSL#3 and Mutaflor - E. coli Nissle 1917) have shown efficacy as&#xD;
      induction or maintenance therapy for UC or pouchitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As an alternative to oral supplementation with probiotic bacteria, prebiotics are more easily&#xD;
      produced and cost-effective substitute. Prebiotics are oligosaccharides that cannot be&#xD;
      enzymatically hydrolyzed in the small intestine, however serve as substrates for fermentation&#xD;
      by probiotic bacteria in the colon. Prebiotics occur in nature; inulin is derived from&#xD;
      chicory and oligosaccharides are present in edible plants. Human studies with healthy&#xD;
      volunteers consuming diet supplemented with oligofructose or inulin demonstrated significant&#xD;
      increase in luminal bifidobacteria and the strict anaerobe Faecalibacterium prausnitzii.&#xD;
      These colonic bacterial groups are shown to alter cytokine production toward a more&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory profile such as stimulating dendritic cell IL-10 production. In addition&#xD;
      fructo-oligosaccharides fermentation in the colon results in improved short-chain fatty acids&#xD;
      (SCFA) production, and in particular butyrate, which is important for the energy metabolism,&#xD;
      cell differentiation and regulation of the immune response in the colon. Ulcerative colitis&#xD;
      (UC), a subset of Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is characterized by disturbed microbial&#xD;
      community (dysbiosis) with marked decrease of strict anaerobes, in particular&#xD;
      Faecalibacterium spp. and Roseburia ssp. in addition to lower production of SCFA. Based on&#xD;
      these findings oligofructose-enriched inulin (Beneo™ Synergy1) was chosen to be used in this&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis: Synergy-1 is a prebiotic food ingredient that can be used safely in the&#xD;
      treatment of mild to moderate UC, and daily oral administration of Synergy-1 will result in&#xD;
      the clinical improvement and/ or remission of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Hypothesis: The improvement of clinical disease from the daily oral administration&#xD;
      of Synergy-1 correlates with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a decrease in inflammatory markers in biopsies (IL-1β, TNF-α) and feces (calprotectin),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a modulation of the mucosal and luminal intestinal microbiota towards more protective&#xD;
           bacteria and a decrease in potential pathogenic bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: This pilot study will evaluate if the use of Synergy-1 is safe, efficacious and&#xD;
      tolerable for the treatment of active mild to moderate left-sided UC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Endpoint: Clinical improvement defined as a decrease in the Mayo score of ≥ 3&#xD;
           but the total Mayo score remains ≥ 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Endpoint: Remission after 9 weeks of treatment (clinical and endoscopic&#xD;
           remission is defined as a score of 0 in the rectal bleeding and stool frequency parts of&#xD;
           the Mayo together with a score of 0 or 1 in the sigmoidoscopic portion of the Mayo. The&#xD;
           total Mayo score must not be greater than 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Safety and Tolerability Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Tolerability: Withdrawal rate due to intolerable drug side effects including, but&#xD;
                not limited to: unacceptable flatulence, abdominal rumbling, bloating, abdominal&#xD;
                pain or diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Safety: Number of patients experiencing a toxic or severe adverse event (AE) during&#xD;
                the treatment period as well as stool culture testing positive for intestinal&#xD;
                pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;

      Study Procedures: The following procedures will be conducted with results recorded in the&#xD;
      Source Document (SD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessment and Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtainment of Informed Consent: Subjects will receive an information document about the&#xD;
           study including the contact number of the principal investigator from the research&#xD;
           nurse. After subjects have received the full information about expected benefits and&#xD;
           possible side effects and inconveniences related to study participation, written consent&#xD;
           will be obtained. The study will be explained by study investigators, and by the&#xD;
           research nurse. The obtainment of informed consent will be documented in SD. Subject&#xD;
           must commence study drug within 14 days of signing consent. Therefore, the screening&#xD;
           visit and the Week 0 visit must be scheduled within 14 days so that eligible patients&#xD;
           can be randomized and begin taking study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Medical History: This will include evaluation of past and/or present conditions/surgical&#xD;
           procedures associated with the following systems: cardiovascular, respiratory,&#xD;
           gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic, endocrine/metabolic, neurologic, lymphatic,&#xD;
           haematological, immune, musculoskeletal/ connective tissue, dermatological,&#xD;
           genito-urinary, psychiatric function, or any other significant diseases or disorders.&#xD;
           The research nurse will record all current concomitant medications as well as the UC&#xD;
           treatments used by the patients in the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Physical Exam: Abbreviated physical examination will be performed by a physician at&#xD;
           baseline and will include an examination of the following: general appearance, head,&#xD;
           ears, eyes, nose, throat, neck and thyroid, skin, cardiovascular system, respiratory&#xD;
           system, gastro-intestinal system, neurological system, musculoskeletal system and lymph&#xD;
           nodes. Blood pressure and pulse rate will be obtained after the subject has remained in&#xD;
           a sitting position for at least 3 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Focused Physical Exam: A focused examination of subject's abdomen will be conducted by&#xD;
           palpating for tenderness and masses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Hematology and Chemistry: Blood will be drawn for hemoglobin, serum creatinine, AST,&#xD;
           alkaline phosphatase, bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Stool Pathogens: A stool specimen will be taken to exclude enteric infection. Tests will&#xD;
           include: Clostridium difficile toxin assay, ova and parasite and culture for Salmonella,&#xD;
           Shigella, Campylobacter, and pathogenic E. coli 0157.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Serum Pregnancy Test: To exclude pregnancy, the research nurse will collect a blood&#xD;
           sample at screening in women of childbearing age to test for β-HCG. The same sample used&#xD;
           for chemistry may also be used for the pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Adverse Event Monitoring: Subjects will be questioned by the research nurse about any&#xD;
           Severe Adverse Events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Side Effect Monitoring: In the Side Effects section of the SD, the nurse will record the&#xD;
           occurrence and severity of side effects: unacceptable flatulence, abdominal rumbling,&#xD;
           bloating, abdominal pain or diarrhea thought to be related to the drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Efficacy Assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Sigmoidoscopy: All sigmoidoscopies for one subject should be performed by the same&#xD;
           investigator to eliminate inter-observer variability. After an enema preparation,&#xD;
           subjects will undergo sigmoidoscopy. Mucosal appearance between the splenic flexure and&#xD;
           the anal verge will be assessed, on a scale of 0 - 3. Pictures of the mucosa will be&#xD;
           taken at this time. Retrospective results from a previous sigmoidoscopy or colonoscopy&#xD;
           can be used in place of a baseline sigmoidoscopy provided the patient consents to be&#xD;
           included in the study no later than 48h after the sigmoidoscopy/ colonoscopy has been&#xD;
           done.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Calculating Mayo Score: Subject's symptoms for Mayo score calculation (rectal bleeding&#xD;
           and stool frequency) will be assessed using verbal scoring based on subject recollection&#xD;
           of symptoms. A score for each parameter will be calculated by taking the average of the&#xD;
           scores for the last available 3 days prior to the study visit. Subjects will be&#xD;
           questioned about symptoms both by the research nurse and the physician. The Mayo will be&#xD;
           calculated by adding the individual scores of the four parameters - bowel frequency,&#xD;
           rectal bleeding, endoscopic score and physician's rating of severity. If the score is 3&#xD;
           - 8 inclusive at week 0 and the inclusion/exclusion criteria were deemed appropriate at&#xD;
           screening, the subject is eligible to initiate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Study Specimen Collection. Fecal samples and biopsies will be collected. Fecal samples&#xD;
           will be assessed for fecal calprotectin and microbiota composition. This material will&#xD;
           be snap frozen after collection. A total of 8 biopsies will be taken during&#xD;
           sigmoidoscopy. For each type of analysis 2 biopsies will be taken from an area of&#xD;
           disease between 15 and 20 cm from the anal verge. Biopsies will be used for analysis of&#xD;
           mucosal host factors (qRT-PCR), mucosa-associated microbiota composition (16S&#xD;
           pyrosequencing) and histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Compliance Monitoring at Study Visits: Subjects must bring in used and unused Synergy-1&#xD;
           sachets so they can be counted by the research nurse to assess compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dispensing of Study Materials&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dispensing of the Patient's Diaries: Each night the subject will record details of their&#xD;
           UC symptoms from the previous 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dispensing of Synergy-1: The research nurse will verbally explain and provide a document&#xD;
           directing how and when to take the Synergy1 supplementation. Subjects will be given a&#xD;
           box by the research nurse with the amount of sachets required for 9 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Test Product, Dosages and Duration of Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Investigational Product: The prebiotic preparation, Synergy-1, consists of 1:1 inulin&#xD;
           and oligosaccharide. The chicory derived inulin has a degree of polymerization (DP) of&#xD;
           10 to 60 (average DP of 25). The oligofructose, which is produced by partial enzymatic&#xD;
           hydrolysis of chicory derived inulin, is a mixture of β-fructans with a DP ranging&#xD;
           between 3 and 7 (average DP of 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Dosage and Administration: Two doses of Synergy-1 will be tested, a low dose of 7.5&#xD;
           g/day and a high dose of 15 g/day. Synergy-1 will be supplied to subjects in sachets. It&#xD;
           can be stored at room temperature. Subjects randomized to 15g per day will take 7.5g at&#xD;
           breakfast only in week one. In week two, they will begin taking 7.5g at breakfast and&#xD;
           7.5g at dinner to reach the target dose of prebiotic. Subjects randomized to 7.5g per&#xD;
           day will take a dose of 3.75g at breakfast only in week one. In week two they will begin&#xD;
           taking 3.75g at breakfast and 3.75g at dinner throughout the study. The half dose in&#xD;
           week one is intended to increase the tolerability of the compound. The powder will be&#xD;
           mixed with a hot liquid to dissolve it and will be taken with meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of Treatment: The duration of treatment will be 9 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assessment of Compliance: The subject must return all used and unused Synergy-1 sachets&#xD;
           so that they may be counted. Specific forms will be used to record treatment compliance&#xD;
           in the Source Document. The subject must return their Patients Diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Concomitant Treatments: Patients currently taking oral 5-ASA therapy will be continued&#xD;
           on the drug at a stable dose. Dose must be stable for 2 weeks prior to the screening&#xD;
           visit, and throughout the study.&#xD;
