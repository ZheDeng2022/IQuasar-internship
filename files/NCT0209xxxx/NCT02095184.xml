  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than three quarter of patients with breast cancer are treated by hormone pills called&#xD;
      tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors (AIs). AIs are drugs that stop female hormone production.&#xD;
      This hormone production mostly happens in fat, muscle, and breast tissue in postmenopausal&#xD;
      women. The female hormone estrogen is an important hormone for the growth of breast cancer&#xD;
      cells. Anastrozole (Arimidex®) and Letrozole (Femara®) are AIs that are approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA). They have been used since 2005 to treat women with early stage&#xD;
      breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When given before surgery (neoadjuvant), both anastrozole and letrozole have been shown to&#xD;
      successfully shrink breast cancer tumors in most patients. In over 50% of patients,&#xD;
      anastrozole and letrozole when given for about 4 months also helped to improve surgery&#xD;
      outcomes. On top of that, whether or not a patient responds to anastrozole and letrozole&#xD;
      before surgery can help the doctor decide whether that patient needs additional chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the things may influence the level of hormone is body weight. It has been previously&#xD;
      shown that postmenopausal women with higher body fat have higher level of female hormone as&#xD;
      well as an increased risk of breast cancer. This is likely due to an increase in aromatase&#xD;
      activity in the fatty tissue. However, at the current time AIs are used at the same doses in&#xD;
      all women with breast cancer no matter whether they have different body weight. Currently, we&#xD;
      do not know for certain whether the same doses of AIs work as well in patients with higher&#xD;
      body fat compared to patients with less body fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to see if women with higher body fat respond differently to AI&#xD;
      treatment compared to women with lower body fat.&#xD;

      GCC 1366 is a prospective randomized window trial to evaluate the anti-proliferative response&#xD;
      in obese and overweight breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant non-steroidal&#xD;
      aromatase inhibitors. Post-menopausal women over the age of 18 years with estrogen receptor&#xD;
      positive Her 2 neu negative stage II-III breast cancer are eligible. Participants will be&#xD;
      randomized according to BMI to neoadjuvant treatment with Arimidex or Letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 90 patients will be enrolled with 15 patients in each cohort below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Patients with BMI &lt; 25.0 kg/m2 treating with anastrozole&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Patients with BMI ≥ 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 treating with anastrozole&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 3: Patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 treating with anastrozole&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 4: Patients with BMI &lt; 25.0 kg/m2 treating with letrozole&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 5: Patients with BMI ≥ 25.0-29.9 kg/m2 treating with letrozole&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 6: Patients with BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 treating with letrozole&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the patients' calculated BMI, patients in each BMI category (normal, overweight, and&#xD;
      obese) will be enrolled in the different cohorts as described above. The first 15 patients in&#xD;
      each BMI category will be treated with anastrozole. After completion of enrollment in cohorts&#xD;
      1, 2, and 3, subsequent patients will be treated with letrozole in cohorts 4, 5, and 6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anastrozole 1 mg or Letrozole 2.5 mg oral daily will be administered and continued for a&#xD;
      minimum of 14 days and a maximum of 28 days (2-4 weeks). Surgery will be performed between&#xD;
      weeks 2-3 of treatment unless there are compelling medical or personal reasons that prevent a&#xD;
      patient from having surgery during this time. In those cases, patients may continue&#xD;
      anastrozole or letrozole up to 4 weeks before surgery. Surgery should be performed within 36&#xD;
      hours of the last dose of anastrozole or letrozole.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor tissue that is obtained for diagnosis or to assess response to initial AI therapy will&#xD;
      be utilized for correlative studies. A patient may be continued on anastrozole or letrozole&#xD;
      beyond 4 weeks (up to 18 weeks) if in the opinion of the treating physician, the patient will&#xD;
      benefit from extended endocrine therapy. In this context, patients will have a core needle&#xD;
      biopsy performed at 2-4 weeks after treatment to assess Ki67 response to AI therapy. Patients&#xD;
      with an appropriate response to treatment as determined by a decrease in Ki67 levels (≤10%)&#xD;
      will be continued on AI treatment. Patients without an appropriate decrease in Ki67 levels&#xD;
      will be recommended to have immediate surgery or a switch to neoadjuvant chemotherapy if&#xD;
      desired by the patient and treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients on extended AI neoadjuvant treatment having core biopsy at 2-4 weeks for Ki67&#xD;
      determination for clinical decision making will be approached and consented for additional&#xD;
      research tissues to be taken at the same time as the biopsy for Ki67 determination. Blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected prior to starting treatment and within 3 days or on the day of&#xD;
      surgery. Additional blood samples will be obtained as clinically necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessment will be performed prior to enrollment and within 3 days or on the day of&#xD;
      surgery. For patients who continue neoadjuvant endocrine therapy past 4 weeks, clinical&#xD;
      assessment will be performed at the time of clinical biopsy and every 4-6 weeks thereafter.&#xD;
      For clinical evidence of progression, patients will be offered immediate surgery or switch to&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiological assessment including mammogram, ultrasound, and breast MRI will be performed as&#xD;
      per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed for 30 days on study after the last dose of anastrozole or&#xD;
      letrozole prior to surgery. For patients who receive extended neoadjuvant therapy with&#xD;
      anastrozole or letrozole and for patients who receive other primary treatment after&#xD;
      anastrozole or letrozole administration prior to surgery, patients will be followed for 30&#xD;
      days on study after the last dose of anastrozole or letrozole. Patients continuing to&#xD;
      experience adverse events attributable to anastrozole or letrozole will be followed as needed&#xD;
      until resolution or stabilization of the adverse events. Patients who are either found to be&#xD;
      ineligible or refuse to start treatment after consenting will not be followed and will be&#xD;
      replaced. Their information will not be collected. After 30 days after the last dose of&#xD;
      anastrozole or letrozole, if there are no continuing adverse events attributable to&#xD;
      treatment, patients will be off study.&#xD;
