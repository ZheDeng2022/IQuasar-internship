  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of overweight and obesity are increasing worldwide. In the U.S., approximately&#xD;
      85,000 new cancer cases per year are related to obesity. Understanding lifestyle behaviors,&#xD;
      their causes, and relations to cancer are critical. Where people spend their time during the&#xD;
      day may be related to their risk of getting cancer. This project will assess behaviors in&#xD;
      different locations across the day and relate exposure to different environments to&#xD;
      biological outcomes.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to advance methods of cancer risk exposure assessment by&#xD;
      measuring both neighborhood access and total environment exposure to healthy environments by&#xD;
      dynamically integrating Global Positioning System (GPS) data with Geographical Information&#xD;
      System (GIS) data. We hypothesize that dynamic GPS based measures of environmental exposure&#xD;
      will be more strongly related to behavior and insulin and inflammation biomarkers than static&#xD;
      address based GIS measures of access.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare Dynamic vs Static GIS measures of physical activity (PA) supportivity and their&#xD;
      associations with PA behaviors, body mass index (BMI), and biological markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare Dynamic vs Static GIS measures of access to healthy food and their associations&#xD;
      with dietary intake, BMI, and biological markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social environment (e.g. eating with others) has been identified as an important determinant&#xD;
      of health, but assessment of this has been limited to self-report through surveys or text&#xD;
      prompts. Images from a person worn camera (the SenseCam) provide an objective and continuous&#xD;
      assessment of social environment e.g. number of social interactions per day, eating alone or&#xD;
      with others. In a subsample of participants (N=30), we propose to explore whether portable&#xD;
      SenseCam measures of social interactions &amp; social behaviors from person view images are more&#xD;
      strongly related to breast and colon cancer risk factors than self-reported social&#xD;
      environment measures. Behaviors and built environments (especially food locations) can also&#xD;
      be coded to validate the accuracy of the GIS measures and the machine learned behavior&#xD;
      categories employed in the full sample.&#xD;

      DNA and RNA will be collected from your blood. This may be used to look at genetic components&#xD;
      important to your health. DNA may be analyzed for important genetic determinants that&#xD;
      indicate unhealthy environment exposure and risk of obesity, cancer, and cardiometabolic&#xD;
      disease. Data from such analyses could guide and may help us learn more about genetic markers&#xD;
      of therapeutic or prevention effectiveness and risk of chronic disease associated with&#xD;
      obesity and unhealthy environment exposure, including cancer.&#xD;
