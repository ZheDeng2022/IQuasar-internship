      The purpose of this study is to prospectively examine the relation between ischemic stroke&#xD;
      and hair cortisol concentration. The investigators hypothesize that patients with ischemic&#xD;
      stroke have higher levels of hair cortisol compared to controls.&#xD;

      Acute physical and emotional stressors are well known triggers of cardiovascular events.&#xD;
      However, it is not clear whether the same association exists with chronic stress. Data on&#xD;
      this issue have been limited by lack of adequate clinical studies and inconclusive results.&#xD;
      One of the possible explanations may be the absence of a reliable mode for quantitative&#xD;
      assessment of chronic stress. To date, studies on the effects of chronic stress on&#xD;
      cardiovascular events have used psychosocial questionnaires. These are subject to recall&#xD;
      bias, as having an event may stimulate the patient to strive harder to identify previous&#xD;
      stressors. Furthermore, most studies on the association of chronic stress and cardiovascular&#xD;
      events have focused on acute coronary events, and only few have examined the association with&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both physical and emotional stress activate several neuroendocrine systems, the most&#xD;
      important being the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis that stimulates the production&#xD;
      and secretion of glucocorticoids (especially cortisol) from the adrenal cortex. Therefore,&#xD;
      cortisol is considered to be a &quot;stress hormone&quot; and higher levels of serum cortisol have been&#xD;
      observed in patients with acute stress such as those presenting with acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction and stroke compared to healthy controls. Moreover, it has been shown that serum&#xD;
      cortisol levels correlates with the severity of the disease and adverse outcome in patients&#xD;
      presenting with stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cortisol levels are routinely determined from blood, salivary or urinary samples. However,&#xD;
      these methods do not provide information on long term cortisol secretion, accounting for the&#xD;
      variability of HPA axis activity. There is a growing pool of evidence that shows that Hair&#xD;
      Cortisol Concentration (HCC) examination provides a reliable retrospective estimation of&#xD;
      integrated cortisol secretion over a period of several months. Hair grows at a rate of about&#xD;
      1 cm/month, thus 3 cm of hair would give an indication of the cortisol levels over the&#xD;
      previous 3 months. HCC has been evaluated in several clinical settings in which activity of&#xD;
      the HPA axis and cortisol levels over a period of time are of interest. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated increased levels of hair cortisol in chronic stress, as well as conditions&#xD;
      associated with stress such as pregnancy , unemployment , PTSD, alcohol withdrawal and&#xD;
      chronic pain and more importantly, in patients admitted to hospital with acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction. Nevertheless, the association between hair cortisol levels and the risk for&#xD;
      stroke has not yet been studied.&#xD;
