    <time_frame>Month 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60, 63, 66, 69 and 72</time_frame>
    <description>ACR70 response is a &gt;= 70% improvement in TJC (28) and SJC (28) and &gt;=70% improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR-core criteria: 1) PGA of arthritis, 2) PtGA of arthritis, 3) participant's assessment of arthritis pain, 4) participant's assessment of functional disability by HAQ-DI, and 5) CRP (mg/L) at each visit. PGA: physician's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis), higher scores=worse condition. PtGA: participant's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 mm (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis condition), higher scores = worse condition. Participant's assessment of arthritis pain: assessed on VAS, 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (most severe pain), higher score = more pain. HAQ-DI: functional disability evaluation, score: 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do), higher score=more disability.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Months 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60 and 63</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Months 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60 and 63</time_frame>
    <description>HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing/grooming; arising; eating; walking; reach; grip; hygiene; and other activities. There were total of 30 items distributed in these 8 domains. Each item was scored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0= no difficulty; 1= some difficulty; 2= much difficulty; 3= unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0 (least difficulty) and 3 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicate more difficulty while performing daily living activities.</description>

        <title>Incidence Rate of Adjudicated Malignancies Excluding Non-melanoma Skin Cancers (NMSC)</title>
        <description>Incidence rate (number of participants with event per 100 participant year [PY]) was defined as the total number of participants with admissible events divided by the total (for all qualifying participants) time at risk for the cohort/treatment group of interest. Malignancy events, excluding NMSC were adjudicated by a steering committee. The risk period (RP) was the last contact date.

        <description>DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis based on a 28-joint assessment. DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated from number of painful joints out of 28 joints (TJC28) and number of swollen joints out of 28 joints (SJC28), CRP (milligrams per liter [mg/L]) and patient's global assessment of disease activity (PtGA) on a 100 mm Visual Analog Scale (VAS) (scores ranging from 0 millimeter [mm] [very well] to 100 mm [worst], higher scores indicated worse health condition). Total DAS28-4 (CRP) score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-4 (CRP) &lt;= 3.2 indicates low disease activity and &gt; 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 indicates moderate disease activity, &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (CRP) &lt; 2.6 indicates remission. DAS28-4 (CRP) = 0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP in mg/L +1) + 0.014*PtGA in mm+ 0.96; ln = natural logarithm, sqrt = square root.</description>

        <description>SDAI is the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC both based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGA and physician's global assessment of health (PhyGA) both assessed on a 0 to 100 mm VAS (higher scores indicate greater affection due to disease activity), and CRP (mg/L). SDAI total score ranges from 0 to 86 with higher score indicating greater disease activity. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt;3.4 to 11 indicates low disease activity &gt;11 to 26 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;26 indicates high disease activity. SDAI = (28TJC) + (28SJC) + PhyGA/10 + PtGA/10 + CRP/10.</description>

        <description>CDAI is the numerical sum of four outcome parameters: TJC and SJC both based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGA and PhyGA both assessed on a 0 to 100 mm VAS (higher scores indicate greater affection due to disease activity). CDAI total score ranges from 0 to 76 with higher score indicating greater disease activity. CDAI &lt;=2.8 indicates disease remission, &gt;2.8 to 10 indicates low disease activity, &gt;10 to 22 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 indicates high disease activity. CDAI = (28TJC) + (28SJC) + PhyGA/10 + PtGA/10.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) Less Than or Equal to (&lt;=) 3.3</title>
        <description>SDAI is the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC both based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGA and PhyGA both assessed on a 0 to 100 mm VAS (higher scores indicate greater affection due to disease activity), and CRP (mg/L). SDAI total score ranges from 0 to 86 with higher score indicating greater disease activity. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt;3.4 to 11 indicates low disease activity &gt;11 to 26 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;26 indicates high disease activity. SDAI = (28TJC) + (28SJC) + PhyGA/10 + PtGA/10 + CRP/10.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants randomized in the study and received at least one dose of investigational drug. Analyses included the data while the participants were receiving the study drug. Here, 'Number Analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for each specified time point. LOCF was applied for missing components, and then composite binary outcome was calculated. The percentages were calculated using the numbers of participants evaluable at each visit as the denominators.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) &lt;=2.8</title>
        <description>CDAI is the numerical sum of four outcome parameters: TJC and SJC both based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGA and PhyGA both assessed on a 0 to 100 mm VAS (higher scores indicate greater affection due to disease activity). CDAI total score ranges from 0 to 76 with higher score indicating greater disease activity. CDAI &lt;=2.8 indicates disease remission, &gt;2.8 to 10 indicates low disease activity, &gt;10 to 22 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 indicates high disease activity. CDAI = (28TJC) + (28SJC) + PhyGA/10 + PtGA/10.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants randomized in the study and received at least one dose of investigational drug. Analyses included the data while the participants were receiving the study drug. Here, 'Number Analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for each specified time point. LOCF was applied for missing components, and then composite binary outcome was calculated. The percentages were calculated using the numbers of participants evaluable at each visit as the denominators.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Simplified Disease Activity Index (SDAI) &lt;=11</title>
        <description>SDAI is the numerical sum of five outcome parameters: TJC and SJC both based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGA and PhyGA both assessed on a 0 to 100 mm VAS (higher scores indicate greater affection due to disease activity), and CRP (mg/L). SDAI total score ranges from 0 to 86 with higher score indicating greater disease activity. SDAI &lt;=3.3 indicates disease remission, &gt;3.4 to 11 indicates low disease activity &gt;11 to 26 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;26 indicates high disease activity. SDAI = (28TJC) + (28SJC) + PhyGA/10 + PtGA/10 + CRP/10.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants randomized in the study and received at least one dose of investigational drug. Analyses included the data while the participants were receiving the study drug. Here, 'Number Analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for each specified time point. LOCF was applied for missing components, and then composite binary outcome was calculated. The percentages were calculated using the numbers of participants evaluable at each visit as the denominators.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Clinical Disease Activity Index (CDAI) &lt;=10</title>
        <description>CDAI is the numerical sum of four outcome parameters: TJC and SJC both based on a 28-joint assessment, PtGA and PhyGA both assessed on a 0 to 100 mm VAS (higher scores indicate greater affection due to disease activity). CDAI total score ranges from 0 to 76 with higher score indicating greater disease activity. CDAI &lt;=2.8 indicates disease remission, &gt;2.8 to 10 indicates low disease activity, &gt;10 to 22 indicates moderate disease activity, and &gt;22 indicates high disease activity. CDAI = (28TJC) + (28SJC) + PhyGA/10 + PtGA/10.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants randomized in the study and received at least one dose of investigational drug. Analyses included the data while the participants were receiving the study drug. Here, 'Number Analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for each specified time point. LOCF was applied for missing components, and then composite binary outcome was calculated. The percentages were calculated using the numbers of participants evaluable at each visit as the denominators.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Disease Activity Score 28-4 (DAS28-4) C-reactive Protein (CRP) &lt;=3.2</title>
        <description>DAS28 is a measure of disease activity in participants with rheumatoid arthritis based on a 28-joint assessment. DAS28-4 (CRP) was calculated from number of painful joints out of 28 joints (TJC28) and number of swollen joints out of 28 joints (SJC28), CRP (mg/L) and PtGA on a 100 mm VAS (VAS: scores ranging from 0 mm [very well] to 100 mm [worst], higher scores indicated worse health condition). Total DAS28-4 (CRP) score range: 0 to 9.4, higher score indicated more disease activity. DAS28-4 (CRP) &lt;= 3.2 indicates low disease activity and &gt; 3.2 to &lt;=5.1 indicates moderate disease activity, &gt;5.1 indicates high disease activity, and DAS28-4 (CRP) &lt; 2.6 indicates remission. DAS28-4 (CRP) = 0.56*sqrt(TJC28) + 0.28*sqrt(SJC28) + 0.36*ln(CRP in mg/L +1) + 0.014*PtGA in mm+ 0.96.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants randomized in the study and received at least one dose of investigational drug. Analyses included the data while the participants were receiving the study drug. Here, 'Number Analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for each specified time point. LOCF was applied for missing components, and then composite binary outcome was calculated. The percentages were calculated using the numbers of participants evaluable at each visit as the denominators.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology 20 Percent (%) (ACR20) Response</title>
        <description>ACR20 response is a &gt;= 20% improvement in TJC (28) and SJC (28) and &gt;=20% improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR-core criteria: 1) PGA of arthritis, 2) PtGA of arthritis, 3) participant's assessment of arthritis pain, 4) participant's assessment of functional disability by HAQ-DI, and 5) CRP (mg/L) at each visit. PGA: physician's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis), higher scores=worse condition. PtGA: participant's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 mm (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis condition), higher scores = worse condition. Participant's assessment of arthritis pain: assessed on VAS, 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (most severe pain), higher score = more pain. HAQ-DI: functional disability evaluation, score: 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do), higher score=more disability.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants randomized in the study and received at least one dose of investigational drug. Analyses included the data while the participants were receiving the study drug. Here, 'Number Analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for each specified time point. LOCF was applied for missing components, and then composite binary outcome was calculated.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology 50% (ACR50) Response</title>
        <description>ACR50 response is a &gt;= 50% improvement in TJC (28) and SJC (28) and &gt;=50% improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR-core criteria: 1) PGA of arthritis, 2) PtGA of arthritis, 3) participant's assessment of arthritis pain, 4) participant's assessment of functional disability by HAQ-DI, and 5) CRP (mg/L) at each visit. PGA: physician's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis), higher scores=worse condition. PtGA: participant's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 mm (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis condition), higher scores = worse condition. Participant's assessment of arthritis pain: assessed on VAS, 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (most severe pain), higher score = more pain. HAQ-DI: functional disability evaluation, score: 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do), higher score=more disability.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants randomized in the study and received at least one dose of investigational drug. Analyses included the data while the participants were receiving the study drug. Here, 'Number Analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for each specified time point. LOCF was applied for missing components, and then composite binary outcome was calculated.</population>

        <title>Number of Participants With an American College of Rheumatology 70% (ACR70) Response</title>
        <description>ACR70 response is a &gt;= 70% improvement in TJC (28) and SJC (28) and &gt;=70% improvement in 3 of the 5 remaining ACR-core criteria: 1) PGA of arthritis, 2) PtGA of arthritis, 3) participant's assessment of arthritis pain, 4) participant's assessment of functional disability by HAQ-DI, and 5) CRP (mg/L) at each visit. PGA: physician's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis), higher scores=worse condition. PtGA: participant's global assessment of arthritis on VAS, 0 mm (very well) to 100 mm (worst arthritis condition), higher scores = worse condition. Participant's assessment of arthritis pain: assessed on VAS, 0 mm (no pain) to 100 mm (most severe pain), higher score = more pain. HAQ-DI: functional disability evaluation, score: 0 (no difficulty) to 3 (unable to do), higher score=more disability.</description>

        <population>FAS included all participants randomized in the study and received at least one dose of investigational drug. Analyses included the data while the participants were receiving the study drug. Here, 'Number Analyzed' signifies number of participants evaluable for each specified time point. LOCF was applied for missing components, and then composite binary outcome was calculated.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Health Assessment Questionnaire - Disability Index (HAQ-DI) at Months 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30, 33, 36, 39, 42, 45, 48, 51, 54, 57, 60 and 63</title>
        <description>HAQ-DI assesses the degree of difficulty a participant has experienced during the past week in 8 domains of daily living activities: dressing/grooming; arising; eating; walking; reach; grip; hygiene; and other activities. There were total of 30 items distributed in these 8 domains. Each item was scored on a 4-point scale from 0 to 3: 0= no difficulty; 1= some difficulty; 2= much difficulty; 3= unable to do. Overall score was computed as the sum of domain scores and divided by the number of domains answered. Total possible score range 0 (least difficulty) and 3 (extreme difficulty), where higher scores indicate more difficulty while performing daily living activities.</description>
