  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Polar lipids have a specific chemical structure: they are an essential component of human&#xD;
      cell membranes, play a major role in the nervous system and also influence the metabolic&#xD;
      pathways including the cholesterol metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Polar lipids are used in food-processing industry for their emulsification properties. The&#xD;
      most famous emulsifier is soya lecithin but milk also naturally contains natural emulsifiers&#xD;
      such as polar lipids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research is to study plasma cholesterol variation after daily intake of&#xD;
      milk polar lipids-fortified cheese products. The volunteers will have to consume 100 g of&#xD;
      cheese product during four weeks instead of their usual cheese products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a bi-centric study with a centre in LYON (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine&#xD;
      Rhône-Alpes) and CLERMONT-FERRAND (Centre de Recherche en Nutrition Humaine Auvergne).&#xD;
