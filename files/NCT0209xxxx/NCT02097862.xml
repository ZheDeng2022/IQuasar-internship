  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The intent of this clinical study is to answer the questions: 1) Is the proposed treatment&#xD;
      safe and 2) Is treatment effective in improving the disease pathology of patients with&#xD;
      diagnosed degenerative disc disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study of ASC implantation performed&#xD;
      intra-discally. ASCs will be derived from the patient's adipose-derived tissue. Liposuction&#xD;
      using local anesthesia and syringe collection will be performed to collect the adipose tissue&#xD;
      specimen for subsequent processing to isolate the stem cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adipose tissue specimen will be collected from the patient's abdomen using a liposuction&#xD;
      cannula. In addition, a sample of peripheral blood will be collected for isolation of&#xD;
      platelet rich plasma. The adipose tissue is processed for separation of the adipose&#xD;
      tissue-derived stem cells, which are then resuspended in platelet rich plasma and transferred&#xD;
      for intra-discal administration. The number of cells injected will vary depending on the&#xD;
      amount of tissue processed and the number of cells obtained from the process. Following the&#xD;
      injections follow-up data will be collected 3, 6 and 12 months after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study time frame is anticipated to be approximately 6 months. This study will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 100 patients.&#xD;

             contraindicates intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient is able to understand the nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Informed written consent of the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Congenital or acquired diseases leading to spine deformations that may upset cell&#xD;
             application.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Spinal segmental instability, spinal canal stenosis, isthmus pathology and other&#xD;
             conditions that may compromise the study&#xD;
