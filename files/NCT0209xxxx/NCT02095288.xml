      Cardiovascular complications of NSAIDs, selective for inhibition of COX-2, stimulated&#xD;
      interest in microsomal prostaglandin E synthase-1 (mPGES-1) as an alternative drug target.&#xD;
      Global deletion of mPGES-1 in mice suppresses PGE2 and augments PGI2 by PGH2 substrate&#xD;
      rediversion. Unlike COX-2 inhibition or gene deletion, mPGES-1 deletion does not cause a&#xD;
      predisposition to thrombogenesis and hypertension. However, cell-specific deletion of mPGES-1&#xD;
      reveals that the predominant substrate rediversion product amongst the prostaglandins varies&#xD;
      by cell type, complicating drug development. We have developed an ultra performance liquid&#xD;
      chromatography/ tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) technique that allows the&#xD;
      quantification of a wide range of lipids beyond the prostaglandin pathway (leukotrienes,&#xD;
      anandamide and the 2-arachidonylglycerol cascades).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to examine different pathway interventions from the arachidonic acid&#xD;
      cascade by anti-inflammatory compounds (with a focus on mPGES-1 inhibition) in whole human&#xD;
      blood in vitro (Part A) and ex vivo (Part B). In Part A, whole human blood will be donated by&#xD;
      healthy volunteers and treated with screening compounds in vitro (outside of the body).&#xD;
      Experiments will be performed to measure an array of lipids in plasma and serum from&#xD;
      pre-stimulated whole blood treated with a single or a combination of the test compounds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study may reveal pathways previously unknown to be affected by the existing&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs and drug candidates, and will possibly suggest new indications and/or&#xD;
      side effects.&#xD;

      Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), selective for inhibition of cyclooxygenase&#xD;
      (COX)-2, alleviate pain and inflammation by suppressing COX-2-derived prostacyclin (PGI2) and&#xD;
      prostaglandin (PG) E2 (1). However, eight placebo-controlled clinical trials have revealed&#xD;
      that NSAIDs, designed to inhibit specifically COX-2, predispose patients to increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular risks including myocardial infarction, stroke, systemic and pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension, congestive heart failure, and sudden cardiac death (1-3). The cardiovascular&#xD;
      adverse effects are attributable to the suppression of COX-2-derived PGI2, a potent&#xD;
      vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet activation (4; 5). Our laboratory has shown that global&#xD;
      deletion, selective inhibition or mutation of COX-2, or deletion of the receptor for PGI2&#xD;
      elevate blood pressure and accelerate thrombogenesis in mouse models (6). We have further&#xD;
      demonstrated that vascular COX-2 deletion predisposes mice to thrombosis and hypertension&#xD;
      (7), and that selective deletion of COX-2 in cardiomyocytes leads to cardiac dysfunction and&#xD;
      enhanced susceptibility to induced arrhythmogenesis (8) that may contribute to the heart&#xD;
      failure and cardiac arrhythmias reported in patients taking NSAIDs specific for inhibition of&#xD;
      COX-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This cardiovascular hazard from NSAIDs prompted interest in the microsomal prostaglandin E&#xD;
      synthase-1 (mPGES-1) as an alternative drug target. mPGES-1 is the inducible PG terminal&#xD;
      synthase that acts downstream of COX-2 and catalyzes the conversion of the intermediate COX&#xD;
      endoperoxide product PGH2 to PGE2 (9). We have previously reported that similar to the&#xD;
      interference with COX-2 expression or function, global or cell-specific deletion of mPGES-1&#xD;
      suppresses PGE2 production; but unlike with COX-2, global mPGES-1 deficiency augments&#xD;
      biosynthesis of PGI2 and does not predispose normo- or hyperlipidemic mice to thrombogenic or&#xD;
      hypertensive events (9-11). Both suppression of PGE2 and augmentation of PGI2 in mPGES-1-/-&#xD;
      mice result from the rediversion of the accumulated PGH2 substrate to PGI2 synthase (10).&#xD;
      Furthermore, global deletion of mPGES-1 limits the vascular proliferative response to wire&#xD;
      injury (12), retards atherogenesis and suppresses angiotensin II-induced abdominal aortic&#xD;
      aneurysm formation in hyperlipidemic mice (10; 13). We have also shown that&#xD;
      mPGES-1-deficiency does not affect ozone-induced airway inflammation or airway&#xD;
      hyper-responsiveness suggesting that pharmacological inhibition of mPGES-1 and endoperoxide&#xD;
      rediversion to PGD2 may not predispose patients at risk to airway dysfunction (14). In&#xD;
      addition, studies by others indicate that global deletion of mPGES-1 reduces the&#xD;
      post-ischemic brain infarction and neurological dysfunction in cerebral ischemia/reperfusion&#xD;
      in mice (15). mPGES-1 deficiency also renders mice less susceptible to excessive inflammation&#xD;
      and hypersensitivity in rodent models of analgesia (16; 17). Taken together, these findings&#xD;
      suggest that pharmacological inhibition of mPGES-1 may retain anti-inflammatory effects from&#xD;
      PGE2 suppression, but due to PGI2 augmentation, targeting of mPGES-1 might avoid the&#xD;
      cardiovascular risks associated with selective COX-2 inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PGH2 substrate rediversion consequent to mPGES-1 deletion is a ubiquitous event observed at&#xD;
      the cellular level and systemically (urinary prostaglandin metabolites); the profile of the&#xD;
      rediversion products, however, varies by cell and tissue type, the disease model, and the&#xD;
      extent of system perturbation (6; 10-14; 18-21). We have shown that in mice deficient in&#xD;
      mPGES-1 in endothelial cells (EC) or vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC), PGI2 is the&#xD;
      predominant substrate rediversion product, whereas deletion of mPGES-1 in myeloid cells&#xD;
      results in shunting of PGH2 mostly towards TxA2(11). Functionally, mice lacking mPGES-1 in&#xD;
      myeloid cells, exhibited a poor response to vascular injury implicating myeloid mPGES-1 as a&#xD;
      cardiovascular drug target. Therefore, cell-specific mPGES-1 deletion leads to a differential&#xD;
      pattern of substrate rediversion and may affect biological function of the system, thus&#xD;
      complicating drug development. What is unknown is whether genetic deletion or pharmacological&#xD;
      inhibition of mPGES-1 can directly (through substrate rediversion) or indirectly (by effects&#xD;
      of prostaglandin rediversion products on enzyme expression or their further metabolism to&#xD;
      transcellular products (22)) influence the lipidome beyond the prostaglandin pathway with&#xD;
      functional consequence. For example, disruption of AA-PGE2 metabolism might influence&#xD;
      arachidonate product formation by the cytochrome P450 (23; 24), leukotriene, anandamide,&#xD;
      2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and other cascades (25). At the cellular level, mPGES-1-/-&#xD;
      macrophages, pretreated with LPS and stimulated with arachidonic acid (AA), exhibit a 5-fold&#xD;
      increase in 12-HHT (12-hydroxyheptadecatrienoic acid), indicating substrate rediversion&#xD;
      towards thromboxane A synthase (18). Inhibition and deletion of COX-2 have been reported to&#xD;
      augment metabolites of 5-lipoxygenase (5-LO) pathway 5-HETE (5-hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid)&#xD;
      and leukotrienes LTB4, LTC4, LTD4 (26-28), and metabolites of CYP450 cascade 14,15-DHET/EET&#xD;
      (dihydroxyeicosatrienoic/epoxyeicosatrienoic acid) (26). Therefore, the substrate AA may be&#xD;
      shunted from one pathway to the other when a particular branch of the cascade is&#xD;
      pharmacologically inhibited or genetically ablated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we will conduct a broad-spectrum lipidomics screening of anti-inflammatory drugs and&#xD;
      drug candidates that antagonize receptors (LTC4, LTB4, EP4 receptors) or inhibit specific&#xD;
      components (COX-1, COX-2, mPGES-1, 5-KO, FLAP, LTA4A) of arachidonic acid pathway in an in&#xD;
      vitro human whole-blood assay (hWBA). Healthy, non-smoking, male and female volunteers will&#xD;
      be asked to donate blood. Human whole blood assays will include (i) determination of the&#xD;
      baseline lipid levels at various time points in stimulated whole blood, (ii) measurement of&#xD;
      lipids in pre-stimulated whole blood treated with a single intervention compound, (iii)&#xD;
      quantitation of lipids in pre-stimulated whole blood treated with a combination of&#xD;
      intervention compounds. We expect that the compounds at focus will affect various&#xD;
      inflammatory pathways resulting in new patterns of substrate rediversion and measurement of&#xD;
      previously unknown lipid products.&#xD;
