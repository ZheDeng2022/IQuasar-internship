  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Single-arm, single site, open label study of the effects of parenteral testosterone followed&#xD;
      by enzalutamide, abiraterone or castration-only therapy in men with metastatic CRPC who&#xD;
      previously progressed on one of these forms of therapy. The study will enroll four cohorts of&#xD;
      patients: men with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on enzalutamide (Cohort A; n=30); men&#xD;
      with metastatic CRPC who have progressed on abiraterone acetate (Cohort B; n=30); men with&#xD;
      metastatic CRPC who have progressed on first line castration-only therapy (Cohort C; n=30);&#xD;
      men with metastatic CRPC with inactivating somatic or germline mutations in ≥2 of the genes&#xD;
      TP53, PTEN, or RB1 (Cohort D; n=20).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The trial will enroll up to 110 patients, 30 for each Cohorts A-C and 20 for Cohort D.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will continue on androgen ablative therapy with LHRH agonist (i.e. Zoladex,&#xD;
      Trelstar, Eligard or Lupron) if not surgically castrated to suppress endogenous testosterone&#xD;
      production. Patients will also receive intramuscular injection with either testosterone&#xD;
      cypionate or testosterone enanthate at a dose of 400 mg every 28 days. This dosing scheme was&#xD;
      designed to produce rapidly fluctuating serum testosterone levels from the supraphysiologic&#xD;
      to the near-castrate range (i.e. Bipolar Androgen Therapy [BAT]). Assessments for response to&#xD;
      testosterone will be made approximately every 3 months. Upon displaying evidence of&#xD;
      progression, patients will then go on to receive either abiraterone (Cohort B) or&#xD;
      enzalutamide (Cohort A), whichever agent they had previously progressed on prior to study&#xD;
      enrollment. Patients in Cohort C will remain on LHRH agonist therapy and receive no&#xD;
      additional androgen ablative hormonal therapy while those in the mutation-positive Cohort D&#xD;
      will receive enzalutamide regardless of prior therapy.&#xD;
