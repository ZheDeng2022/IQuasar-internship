      The goal of this clinical research study is to find the highest tolerable dose of the&#xD;
      combination of regorafenib and cetuximab that can be given to patients with advanced solid&#xD;
      tumors. The safety and effectiveness of this drug combination will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, you will be assigned to a dose&#xD;
      level of the study drugs based on when you join the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 5 dose level combinations of regorafenib and cetuximab will be tested. Up to 3&#xD;
      participants will be enrolled at each dose level. The first group of participants will&#xD;
      receive the lowest dose level combination. Each new group will receive a higher dose of&#xD;
      either regorafenib or cetuximab than the group before it, if no intolerable side effects were&#xD;
      seen. This will continue until the highest tolerable dose combination of regorafenib and&#xD;
      cetuximab are found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest tolerable dose combination is found, up to 10 more participants may be&#xD;
      enrolled. This group (called the Dose Expansion group) is enrolled to help researchers study&#xD;
      the safety and effectiveness of this dose level combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each study cycle is 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take regorafenib by mouth on Days 1-5, 8-12, and 15-19 of each cycle. You will&#xD;
      swallow the whole capsules with 1 cup of water (about 8 ounces) 1 time a day. Do not break,&#xD;
      chew, or open your capsules. The doctor will discuss this with you.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive cetuximab by vein over about 1-2 hours on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each&#xD;
      cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each cycle, you will be asked to complete a questionnaire so the study team will better&#xD;
      understand any symptoms you may be having that are related to use of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycle 1, blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine tests&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic (PD) tests. PD testing measures how the level of study drug in your body&#xD;
      may affect the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between Days 8 and 14, Days 15 and 21, and Days 22 and 28 of Cycle 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      °Blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1 of Cycles 2 and beyond:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine will be collected for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week, blood (about 4 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every other cycle (every 8 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
      °You will have an x-ray and a CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may continue receiving regorafenib and cetuximab for as long as the doctor thinks it is&#xD;
      in your best interest. You will no longer be able to take the study drugs if the disease gets&#xD;
      worse, if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be off study after the end-of-study visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 30 days after your last dose of study drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 teaspoons) and urine will be collected for routine and PD tests tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an x-ray and a CT scan to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be asked about any health problems you may have and if you have had any side&#xD;
      effects. If your study doctor thinks it is needed, you may have follow-up for a longer period&#xD;
      of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Regorafenib is FDA approved for the treatment of metastatic&#xD;
      colorectal cancer. Cetuximab is FDA approved for the treatment of K-Ras wild type colorectal&#xD;
      cancer as well as head and neck cancer. The combination of regorafenib and cetuximab is&#xD;
      currently being used in advanced solid tumor patients for research purposes only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 83 patients will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;
