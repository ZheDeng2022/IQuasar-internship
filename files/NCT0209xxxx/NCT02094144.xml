      Community-dwelling women aged 55 or over are recruited at public meetings aimed at promoting&#xD;
      physical activity in postmenopausal women. Women are eligible and enrolled in the study if&#xD;
      they have no significant disease affecting lower limb function and if they have a sedentary&#xD;
      lifestyle. All study participants provide written informed consent to participate to the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are then randomized either to the control group (women have to maintain their&#xD;
      lifestyle) or to the exercise group : 40 minutes of brisk walking 3d/wk for 6 months (two&#xD;
      supervised sessions and one session performed one their own per week with a detailed&#xD;
      program). The intensity of the program is adapted to the heart rate work and gradually&#xD;
      increases over the 6-month program. The objective of the study is to determine the health&#xD;
      benefits of brisk on walking ability, diet, muscle strength, balance, blood pressure, bone&#xD;
      density, body weight, lean and fat mass, depression symptoms, behavioral, emotional&#xD;
      responses, sleep quality, and biological indicators of health.&#xD;

      Community-dwelling women aged 55 or over are recruited at public meetings aimed at promoting&#xD;
      physical activity in postmenopausal women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are eligible and enrolled in the study if they meet the following criteria : (i) not&#xD;
      diagnosed with any of the following conditions: rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis,&#xD;
      ischemic heart disease, previous joint replacement surgery or cerebrovascular disease&#xD;
      affecting lower limb function, malignant tumors, (ii) without pain and medication known to&#xD;
      alter physical performance (e.g., corticosteroids, estrogens, statins, or anti-estrogen&#xD;
      drugs). To recruit a sample of asymptomatic sedentary postmenopausal women, women with a&#xD;
      score value above 9.4 at the Physical Activity Questionnaire for the Elderly (PAQE) (Serres,&#xD;
      Gautier, Varray, &amp; Préfaut, 1998) and a 5-minute walking distance (6MWD) greater than105% of&#xD;
      the predicted 6MWD based on Troosters' reference equation are excluded. The Troosters'&#xD;
      reference equation is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before entering the study, women are asked to provide a medical certificate of no&#xD;
      contraindication to performing the 6MWD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women are then randomized either to the control group (women are asked to maintain their&#xD;
      lifestyle, and especially their physical activity habits) or to the exercise group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise intervention consists in 40 minutes of brisk walking 3d/wk for 6 months. During&#xD;
      the 6-month program, subjects are required to attend 2 outdoor supervised sessions per week,&#xD;
      and to exercise 1d/wk on their own, with a detailed and tailored program. The intensity of&#xD;
      walking is adapted by skilled exercise trainers to individual physical capability of each&#xD;
      subject. Considering that the theoretical maximum heart rate (HR) of the subject is 208-0.7 *&#xD;
      age (Tanaka, Monahan, &amp; Seals, 2001), the training starts at 40% of HR work (difference&#xD;
      between maximum HR and HR at rest). Training intensity is gradually increased to finally&#xD;
      reaching 75% of the HR work. Participants wear a heart rate monitor (Polar Elctro Inc,&#xD;
      Woodbury, NY) during each of the 3 weekly sessions and the content of each session is&#xD;
      collected in a notebook (meters walked, duration of the brisk walking exercise, HR, adherence&#xD;
      to the program).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is approved by the Committee for Protection of Human Subjects (CPP&#xD;
      Sud-Méditerranée III, Number: 2008.07.04). All study participants provide a written informed&#xD;
      consent to participating to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of the study are to determine the health benefits of the intervention program&#xD;
      in comparison to the control group in several domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesurements at baseline and at the end of the study comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body composition (bone density, body lean and fat mass by dual-energy X-ray&#xD;
           absorptiometry (DXA) (Hologic QDR-1500 device, Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subjects are weighed on an electronic scale to the nearest 0.1 kg, and their height&#xD;
           is measured to the nearest 0.1 cm to calculate the body mass index (BMI)(kg/m²).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endurance training performance is estimated by the distance walked during the 6-minute&#xD;
           walk test (6MWT). The 6MWT is performed according to the American Thoracic Society&#xD;
           (2002) guidelines in an indoor corridor (ATS, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maximum grip strength and isometric maximum knee extension strength are measured after a&#xD;
           warm-up session, as previously described (Blain et al., 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Diet over the previous 7 days using the questionnaire used in the SUVIMAX study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sleep quality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depression score : French version of the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (Beck, Steer, &amp;&#xD;
           Carbin, 1988; Cathébras, Mosnier, Lévy, Bouchou, &amp; Rousset, 1994). The BDI contains&#xD;
           cognitive (e.g., pessimism, worthlessness) and physical (e.g., fatigue and loss of&#xD;
           energy) subscales. The BDI has been shown to be sensitive to exercise-induced changes in&#xD;
           healthy adults (Stein &amp; Motta, 1992).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Baseline physical activity, covering household activities, sports, and leisure&#xD;
           activities is assessed using PAQE (Voorrips, Ravelli, Dongelmans, Deurenberg, &amp; Van&#xD;
           Staveren, 1991). The activities of walking outside, bicycling, and doing heavy housework&#xD;
           are summed to a physical activity score (range, 0-3). Respondents not participating in&#xD;
           any activity are given zero points, whereas three points corresponds to participation in&#xD;
           all three activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjective health status is assessed with the following item: In comparison to people&#xD;
           with the same age, you consider your health as better (1), equal (2), worst (3) ?.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia (TSK) is a 17-item questionnaire that assesses the&#xD;
           fear of (re)injury due to movement (Swinkels-Meewisse, Swinkels, Verbeek, Vlaeyen, &amp;&#xD;
           Oostendorp, 2003). Women are asked to make ratings of their degree of agreement with&#xD;
           each of the 17 statements. Ratings are summed to yield a total score where higher values&#xD;
           reflect greater fear of (re)injury (French, France, Vigneau, French, &amp; Evans, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Balance is assessed using a force platform (Medicapteurs France SAS) with two conditions&#xD;
           tested, eyes open (EO) and eyes closed (EC), lasting 51.2 seconds each and separated by&#xD;
           a 30-second rest period. The COP trajectories in antero-posterior (AP) and medio-lateral&#xD;
           (ML) directions are sampled at 40 Hz, leading time series with length of 2048.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional stabilometric measures : the AP and ML standard deviations (SDx and SDy, mm), the&#xD;
      effective COP path length (mm), and the area of the 90% confidence ellipse enclosing the COP&#xD;
      (mm²).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complexity measures of postural sway : The complexity of postural sway is quantified by means&#xD;
      of three measures : Percentage of determinism of recurrence quantification analysis (DETRQA)&#xD;
      , Sample entropy (SampEn), Complexity index of multiscale entropy (CIMSE)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The adherence rate to the brisk walking program is calculated based on the data recorded&#xD;
           in the notebooks (number of supervised and self-reported home based walking sessions&#xD;
           performed/72 sessions of the program).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Individual content of the training (meters walked measured with a podometer; total&#xD;
           duration of the walking exercises, mean HR, etc…).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fasted morning blood samples are collected at baseline and at the end of the study and&#xD;
           aliquots are frozen at -80 °C until analysis.&#xD;
