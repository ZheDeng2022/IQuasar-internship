  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At present research has generated controversy regarding the utility of antiseptics in wound&#xD;
      management for diabetic foot ulcers syndrome. However, these studies have been done in&#xD;
      tissues and animal models. This study involves the best presently antiseptic for residual&#xD;
      effect and low toxicity in an approach to eliminate microorganisms promoters formation of&#xD;
      biofilm, contributing to the treatment for accelerated closure the diabetic foot ulcers&#xD;
      syndrome .&#xD;
&#xD;
      So it is necessary to determine if irrigation ulcer diabetic foot syndrome with chlorhexidine&#xD;
      0.125 % aqueous solution determines the decrease of the surface to a greater extent than the&#xD;
      standard treatment using irrigation with sterile deionized water .&#xD;

      The present study be made performed at the Hospital General Leon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with Diabetes Mellitus state of Guanajuato.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Universe:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with diabetes mellitus and diabetic foot syndrome Guanajuato state . sample: Will be&#xD;
      evaluated in patients with diabetes mellitus presenting loss of continuity of the skin of the&#xD;
      lower limbs and coming to the clinic wound´s of the León General Hospital . This clinic&#xD;
      provides services to patients in the state of Guanajuato with diabetic foot syndrome,&#xD;
      including them within a multidisciplinary management program .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculation of Sample :&#xD;
&#xD;
      72 patients; more eight for lost estimates, 40 patients for each group are required to have a&#xD;
      80 % chance of detecting , with a significance level of 5%, an increase in the primary&#xD;
      outcome measure of 5% in the control group and 6 % in group experimental .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alpha: 5 % Power : 80 %&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indistinct gender Patients over 18 years with Diabetes Mellitus and submit ulcer from&#xD;
      diabetic foot syndrome not involving tendon , capsule or bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With proper state of vascular perfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ulcers in patients with interdigital or difficult to measure the affected surface areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients not be located at follow-up or wish to stop participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be invited to participate in the study patients with diabetes mellitus consecutive&#xD;
      presented with ulcers plantar to IA or IB grade classification system ulcers , University of&#xD;
      Texas, in the area of Clinical wound´s of the Hospital General Leon between Abril and&#xD;
      November 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After explaining the study information and check which is understandable , they provide the&#xD;
      sheet to be signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently selected patients will be given a vascular ultrasound to measure the ankle&#xD;
      brachial index and determine the absence of vascular compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      They carry out their medical history with emphasis on analyzing clinical data , including the&#xD;
      characteristics of the ulcer (type of exudate , measured surface area affected , type of&#xD;
      tissue involved in the ulcer to its depth ) and biochemical parameters .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Be weighed and measured at the first visit and not having biochemical data are requested to&#xD;
      collect this information in subsequent follow-up visit .&#xD;
&#xD;
      They were then treated with the principles of the standard treatment, under the following&#xD;
      criteria :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Remove the ulcer exudate by spraying one of the two ingredients making mechanical drive&#xD;
           for 5 minutes, or until completely negative to the visual evidence of exudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Completely remove hyperkeratosis and devitalized tissue from the periphery of the ulcer&#xD;
           with cutting material dissection with sterile dressing and drag , until visually&#xD;
           eliminate the exudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The treated area is dry and sore&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Two photographs at a distance of 20 cm perpendicular to the ulcer will be taken,&#xD;
           covering a 1 square centimeter reference for measuring the area affected by diabetic&#xD;
           foot ulcer syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The solution so blinded to the ulcer and covered with sterile dressing will be applied&#xD;
           for 24 hours .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient will be instructed to continue treatment every 24 hours as follows :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sterile dressing will be removed and continuously irrigate for 5 seconds with the&#xD;
           ingredient that was assigned .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Undiscovered for 24 hours , until the next day irrigation dressing area will be placed .&#xD;
           Also need to avoid contact with any surface over the affected area until the next&#xD;
           assessment .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform the same strategy for 24 hours , and on day 7 will go to the wound clinic to&#xD;
           clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 7 days until complete 6 views, clinical evaluation are performed, irrigation with&#xD;
           the selected ingredient and it will take 2 pictures at a distance of 20 cm perpendicular&#xD;
           to the boil again , covering a reference of 1 square centimeter to measure the area&#xD;
           affected by the diabetic foot ulcer syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Every 7 days of initiation of therapy in the clinic consultation wounds measured and&#xD;
           circulation and comment the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ulcer area in square millimeters .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Coloring of the ulcer .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of exudate ; turbid serous .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of tissue involved in the ulcer to its depth. If any patients have increased&#xD;
           intensity of the signs and symptoms of diabetic foot syndrome, classified as a major&#xD;
           step on the scale of ulcers Classification System of the University of Texas, perform&#xD;
           analysis and comprehensive treatment will be redefined according to the suggestions of&#xD;
           ulcer classification system of the University of Texas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material cleaning the ulcer :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingredient 1: Preparation of spray application of chlorhexidine gluconate 0.125% .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ingredient 2: Preparation of spray application of sterile deionized water .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of application of ingredients as described previously .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of randomization : is effected by assigning random numbers balanced computer, the code&#xD;
      will be assigned to each of the ingredients which have identical presentations , they will&#xD;
      balance to the sample size . The code will not be known by the patient, observer and analyst.&#xD;
      Only be known by one of the advisors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical methods :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The description of the data, in the case of non-numerical variables will be performed by&#xD;
      reporting proportions and confidence interval of 95 % (95 %) in the case of numerical&#xD;
      variables, the description will be made based on averages and standard deviation or medians&#xD;
      and Q1- Q3 range , depending on the result of the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to evaluate the&#xD;
      Gaussian distribution of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of numerical variables were not performed by Chi square test . Comparison of the&#xD;
      rates of reduction in the size of ulcers of diabetic foot syndrome for both treatments will&#xD;
      be based on the t test for independent samples or by Kruskal- Wallis test , depending on data&#xD;
      distribution .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all cases be considered as the significance level alpha value &lt;0.05 .&#xD;
