      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Malaria is a disease that affects many children and adults in Uganda and Africa. If it is&#xD;
      not treated, it can make some people severely ill. TMP-SMX (Trade names Bactrim, Septrin) is&#xD;
      a drug that is given to children born to HIV-positive mothers to help prevent infection.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that TMP-SMX also may kill malaria infection in the very early stages of&#xD;
      infection in the body, which may positively impact the way the body can fight malaria&#xD;
      infection. Researchers want to know if giving TMP-SMX for 6 months longer than usual helps&#xD;
      children fight malaria better in this way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To find out if taking TMP-SMX for longer than usual helps fight off malaria in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Infants 0-6 weeks of age who are HIV negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infants will be screened with a medical history and physical exam. A small amount of&#xD;
           blood will be taken. The mothers medical records will be reviewed. Mothers will be asked&#xD;
           about when they breastfeed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take TMP-SMX according to their doctor s orders. In Uganda, mothers&#xD;
           will get a mosquito net with insecticide on it as per standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will come to the clinic once a month, every month, until the study ends in&#xD;
           2 3 years. Each visit will repeat the screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will also visit the clinic every month for a medical history, physical&#xD;
           exam, and different blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Six weeks after breastfeeding is stopped, children taking TMP-SMX will come into the&#xD;
           clinic and will either be taken off the drug or will continue taking the drug for 6 more&#xD;
           months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If a child becomes sick, it is important that the mother bring him or her to the RHSP&#xD;
           clinic in Rakai.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malaria remains one of the most significant causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the&#xD;
      world. Recent studies indicate that drugs used in HIV management can have antimalarial&#xD;
      properties. In animal models, prophylactic doses of trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMPSMX),&#xD;
      an antibiotic commonly used as prophylaxis against opportunistic infections in HIVexposed and&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients, have been shown to arrest liver stage development of malaria&#xD;
      parasites. Indeed, the liver stage of malaria parasites may be important to target since it&#xD;
      is during this stage that clinical symptoms are absent and fewer parasites are present.&#xD;
      TMP-SMX, used in HIV-exposed and HIV-infected subjects for opportunistic infection&#xD;
      prophylaxis, significantly reduces clinical malaria, even in areas of moderate to high&#xD;
      transmission intensity and high antifolate drug resistance. It is possible that reduction in&#xD;
      liver stage parasite burden contributes to this unexpected effect. Nonetheless, the&#xD;
      contribution of this liver-stage parasite killing to the reduction in clinical malaria&#xD;
      observed in patients receiving TMP-SMX remains undescribed. Our primary objective aims to&#xD;
      answer whether TMP-SMX reduces liver stage malaria infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For our exploratory objectives, we are interested in TMP-SMX effects on the development of&#xD;
      anti-infection malaria immunity and effects on transmission. In mice, TMP-SMX prophylaxis&#xD;
      during repeated malaria exposures has been shown to induce protective, anti-infection&#xD;
      immunity against malaria (Charlotte Hobbs, unpublished data), which is distinct from&#xD;
      naturally acquired immunity in which, after multiple infections, patients have less severe&#xD;
      disease. TMP-SMX impact on the development of malaria-specific immunity, however, requires&#xD;
      further investigation. Also, TMP-SMX has been shown to have sporonticidal (mosquito-oocyst&#xD;
      killing) activity at levels achieved in patients on TMP-SMX prophylaxis in susceptible&#xD;
      strains of P. falciparum, but the effects of TMP-SMX on transmission in the field remain&#xD;
      undescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized study plans to enroll 164-220 HIV-uninfected, HIV-exposed (HUE) and 60&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected, HIV-unexposed (HUU) children in Kalisizo Hospital Health Center, Labor and&#xD;
      Delivery Unit, Kalisizo, located within Rakai District, Uganda. HUE children will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1 into 2 arms. In the first arm (Standard of Care [SOC] arm), 82-110 children&#xD;
      will receive TMP-SMX until 6 weeks after cessation of breast-feeding (age 12-18 months). In&#xD;
      the second arm (Extended Prophylaxis [EP] arm), 82-110 children will receive SOC and remain&#xD;
      on TMP-SMX for an additional 6 months after the cessation of breast-feeding. The 60 HUU&#xD;
      children will serve as controls to establish baseline infection parameters in the community.&#xD;
      Blood will be drawn from all subjects monthly via heel/finger stick to analyze malaria&#xD;
      parasitemia. Additionally, venous blood will be drawn every 6 months to analyze cellular and&#xD;
      humoral immunity. The duration of this study participation will be a minimum of 2 and up to 3&#xD;
      years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of TMP-SMX impact on liver stage malaria infection and the development of&#xD;
      protective anti-infection immunity in children will help guide decisions regarding TMP-SMX&#xD;
      prophylaxis duration for HIV-exposed children in malaria endemic areas.&#xD;
