      Stroke patients are given prophylactic treatment with clopidogrel to prevent new strokes.&#xD;
      Some of these patients (the investigators don't know precisely how many, but previous studies&#xD;
      indicate 4-34%) are so called non-responders, when you measure on a blood sample from the&#xD;
      patient. These patients may have an increased risk for less effect of the treatment and&#xD;
      therefore a higher risk for a new stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators want to investigate if clopidogrel non-responders have a clinically&#xD;
      increased risk of a new stroke by following the patients for two years. With this study the&#xD;
      investigators aim to ensure that all patients get the best prophylactic treatment and reduce&#xD;
      the risk of early death and dependency of others.&#xD;

      Background and purpose&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, who have had a stroke, have an increased risk of a new stroke. Clinical trials have&#xD;
      proven that inhibition of blood platelets reduce the risk of a new stroke. Unfortunately&#xD;
      there are patients not responding (non-responders) to anti-platelet treatment. Patients not&#xD;
      responding might have a greater risk of a new stroke compared to patients responding&#xD;
      (responders) to anti-platelet treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These clinical trials does not take into account that an unknown number of the patients are&#xD;
      unresponsive (non-responders) to inhibition of blood platelet treatment and thereby in a&#xD;
      poorer prophylactic treatment than necessary and have a higher risk of early death,&#xD;
      disability and depending upon others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trials of other anti-platelet regimes (acetylsalicylic acid) have shown that 33 % of stroke&#xD;
      patients are non-responders and that they had an 10 times increased risk of vascular death,&#xD;
      myocardial infarction or stroke in the first two years after the stroke and start of&#xD;
      treatment. Therefore it is likely that it is of great clinical importance to identify&#xD;
      non-responders to optimize therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today Clopidogrel is the drug-of-choice in prophylactic stroke treatment. To our knowledge no&#xD;
      one has studied the non-responder problem of Clopidogrel as prophylactic treatment in stroke&#xD;
      patients. Due to genetic differences, data from other studies can't be transferred to Danish&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clopidogrel non-responder problem has been studied in other groups of patients and they&#xD;
      have shown that up to 34% of the patients are Clopidogrel non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is of great significance to the patient, their relatives and socioeconomic. The&#xD;
      non-responder problem will be studied in a Danish population and the patients who do not&#xD;
      respond to the drug-of-choice will receive another treatment. By this we better prevent that&#xD;
      the patient has another stroke and thereby minimize the risk of previous death, loss of&#xD;
      function and depending upon others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is to our knowledge the first to systematically study the risk of stroke in&#xD;
      patients in prophylactic Clopidogrel treatment who are non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is one of several studies with research-fellowship at Department og Neurology,&#xD;
      Roskilde University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project summary Stroke patients admitted to the Stroke Unit will be included in the project.&#xD;
      Patients who receive Clopidogrel will 2 weeks after discharge be called to the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic and undertake a blood sample to determine whether they are Clopidogrel responders or&#xD;
      non-responders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be followed in the outpatient clinic every 3 months for two years by a&#xD;
      doctor or project nurse as outpatient visits alternating phone calls to ensure that the&#xD;
      patient follows the prescribed treatment and to determine if the patient has had a new&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We estimate that 200 patients will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design, recruitment, method. The study is a double blinded follow-up study of non-responders&#xD;
      to Clopidogrel and systematic statement of healthcare data suspected of influence on the&#xD;
      results of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient admitted with stroke and receiving prophylactic treatment with Clopidogrel on the day&#xD;
      of discharge will be included in the study after orally and written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics The study will follow the Helsinki Declaration of 1984, modified at the 41. World&#xD;
      Congress in Hong Kong 1989. The study i already reported to the local Datatilsynet and&#xD;
      approved by the local ethics committee (Region Sjællands Videnskabsetiske Komite). The study&#xD;
      is pending approval at the Danish Medical Agency (Sundhedsstyrelsen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples taken in the study will not delay the time to start of prophylactic treatment.&#xD;
      Patients in the study will be treated the same as patients not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Project benefits In Denmark 10 000 people suffer from stroke every year. Some dies almost&#xD;
      instantly while others are disabled for life and some recover fully. These patients all have&#xD;
      an increased risk of a new stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Today the treatment of stroke is limited to a very small percentage of the patients and we&#xD;
      know that prophylactic treatment is very important. Reducing the risk of stroke reduces the&#xD;
      risk of early death, disability and depending upon others. The project thereby benefits the&#xD;
      patient in the study, future stroke patients and their relatives and socio economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be externally monitored by the Good Clinical Practice unit in Denmark and&#xD;
      all changes to the project protocol will be reported to the local ethics committee (Region&#xD;
      Sjællands Videnskabsetiske Komite) and the Danish Medical Agency (Sundhedsstyrelsen).&#xD;
