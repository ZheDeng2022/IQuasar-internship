  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Emerging evidences indicate that performance on a variety of functional movement screens can&#xD;
      identify athletes/soldiers at risk for injury. These field expedient tests have not been&#xD;
      validated in a military setting or across different military occupational specialties. In&#xD;
      this prospective study the investigators plan to screen 300 combatants for a 1-year time&#xD;
      frame in order to validate the suggested algorithm of a list of modifiable and non-modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors which are hypothesized to predict injury risk during the military service.&#xD;

      Injury data will be collected through physician exam, self-report, profile data, and&#xD;
      healthcare utilization data. Injury data will be collected at baseline and for six&#xD;
      iterations, every 60 days, over the course of one year following baseline. Based on the data&#xD;
      collected, clinical prediction rules will be used to develop computerized algorithm to&#xD;
      predict injury risk in these populations. Moreover, these results will assist in creating&#xD;
      individualized preventing physical training program.&#xD;

    <measure>Injury surveillance</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>Yearly injury surveillance will be conducted on a 2-month basis in which the research team will prospectively collect data on any injury occurrence and medical health utilization among the study's subjects.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The physical assessment of risk factors will include the following 8 tests: foot structure and mobility (foot length, seated and standing AHI), assessment of functional movement (FMS), lower extremity power (SLVJ), hop testing, lower quarter Y-Balance Test (LQYBT), and upper quarter Y Balance test (UQYBT), ankle dorsiflexion, and the 240m shuttle run as detailed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Demographic and biopsychosocial data</measure>
    <time_frame>1 week</time_frame>
    <description>Demographic and biopsychosocial data collection will include general information, such as: age, gender, anthropometrics (height, weight), past medical history previous sport engagements, injury in the last 12 months, past physical activities and levels, smoking status, marital status, and educational level. In addition to these demographic variables all subjects will answer questions related to biopsychosocial factors associated with injury.&#xD;
This includes questions related to job/life satisfaction, numeric pain ratings associated with depression, anxiety, frustration, anger, and fear, and completion of the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) which will help in determining the influence of indicators of depression on future injury risk.</description>
