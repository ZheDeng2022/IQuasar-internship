  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In accordance with International Conference on Harmonisation (ICH) E14 guidelines, this Phase&#xD;
      I thorough QT (TQT) study will assess the arrhythmogenic potential of GFT505, by evaluating&#xD;
      its effect on QT/QTc prolongation in healthy male and female subjects. According to the&#xD;
      guidelines, such studies should typically be performed at the expected therapeutic dose and a&#xD;
      supra-therapeutic dose that is 3-4-fold higher than the therapeutic dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GFT505 has previously been tested at 240 mg/d in 14-day multiple administration to healthy&#xD;
      overweight subjects (study GFT505-111-7), and both safety and tolerability were very good.&#xD;
      However, this dose corresponds to only 2-fold the expected therapeutic dose of 120 mg/d.&#xD;
      Therefore, the current TQT study will be preceded by a multiple ascending dose study in which&#xD;
      the safety and tolerability of 2 dose levels of GFT505 (300 and 360 mg) corresponding to 2.5&#xD;
      and 3 times the expected therapeutic dose will be evaluated. The highest dose level for which&#xD;
      safety and tolerability are considered satisfactory will be the supra-therapeutic dose used&#xD;
      in the TQT study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present trial is split into two successive parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Part I is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study designed to obtain&#xD;
           safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic (PK) data after 14-day multiple oral&#xD;
           administrations of once-daily increasing doses of GFT505 (300 and 360 mg) in healthy&#xD;
           male subjects. The starting dose of 300 mg/day has been selected on the basis of the&#xD;
           results of previous clinical trials and corresponds to the highest dose given in healthy&#xD;
           subjects according to a single dose regimen (study GFT505-111-7). A total of 24 male&#xD;
           subjects will be included, 12 for each cohort (a cohort corresponding to a dose level).&#xD;
           In each cohort, 9 subjects will receive GFT505 and 3 will receive placebo. A Safety&#xD;
           Review Committee (SRC) will have a formal meeting after full completion of at least 10&#xD;
           out of 12 subjects of each dose level to review under blinded conditions all safety data&#xD;
           and to conclude on the safety and tolerability of a given dose level. Between the first&#xD;
           and the second dose level, the SRC will give its agreement on the dose escalation, and&#xD;
           at completion of the second level the SRC will define the supra-therapeutic dose to be&#xD;
           administered in Study Part II.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Part II will be a parallel group, randomized, placebo-controlled study, with&#xD;
           stratification by gender. The study is designed to investigate the potential impact of&#xD;
           14-day multiple oral administrations of once-daily GFT505 on QT/QTc prolongation under&#xD;
           conditions of maximal GFT505 exposure, i.e. by administering the expected therapeutic&#xD;
           dose of 120 mg/d and a supra-therapeutic dose (defined according to the results of Study&#xD;
           Part I), to healthy male and female subjects. A single oral dose of 400 mg moxifloxacin&#xD;
           will be used as a positive control in order to document the sensitivity of the&#xD;
           experimental conditions. The study treatment administration will be double-blind for&#xD;
           placebo and GFT505 and open for moxifloxacin. The ECG readings will be performed under&#xD;
           blinded conditions. A preliminary sample size of 128 subjects to have at least 124&#xD;
           evaluable subjects has been fixed by formal justification on a theoretical basis. ECG&#xD;
           data collected during Study Part I will support a formal determination using observed&#xD;
           data and thus will lead to a final sample size. In all cases, it is anticipated that the&#xD;
           sample size could not be less than 124 evaluable subjects. Each gender will represent at&#xD;
           least 40% of the study population. Both sub-groups will be balanced between the 4&#xD;
           treatment groups.&#xD;
