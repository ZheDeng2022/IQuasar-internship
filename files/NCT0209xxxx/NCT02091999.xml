    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and pharmacokinetics of enfortumab&#xD;
      vedotin as well as assess the immunogenicity and antitumor activity in subjects with&#xD;
      metastatic urothelial cancer and other malignant solid tumors that express Nectin-4.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All subjects will receive a single 30 minute IV infusion of enfortumab vedotin once weekly&#xD;
      for the first 3 weeks of every 4 weeks (i.e., on Days 1, 8, and 15). A cycle is 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a 3 part study. Part A will evaluate enfortumab vedotin in subjects with&#xD;
      histologically confirmed malignant solid tumors (excluding sarcomas) that are resistant or&#xD;
      have recurred. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of&#xD;
      enfortumab vedotin, investigator decision or consent withdrawal. Part A will follow a&#xD;
      modified Continual Reassessment Method (mCRM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B, will evaluate enfortumab vedotin in 3 different expansion cohorts: 1) Urothelial&#xD;
      cancer subjects with renal insufficiency defined as a Creatinine Clearance ≥ 15 ml/min and &lt;&#xD;
      30 ml/min, 2) subjects with Metastatic Non Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) and 3) subjects&#xD;
      with Metastatic Ovarian Cancer. With the exception of the renal insufficiency cohort,&#xD;
      enrollment into Part B will occur at the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) established in Part&#xD;
      A. Enrollment into the renal insufficiency cohort will begin at starting dose and escalated&#xD;
      using a 3 + 3 dose escalation design. Subjects will continue treatment until disease&#xD;
      progression, intolerability of enfortumab vedotin or consent withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C will evaluate enfortumab vedotin at the RP2D (determined from Part A) in subjects who&#xD;
      have been previously treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors (CPI) in the metastatic&#xD;
      setting. Subjects will continue treatment until disease progression, intolerability of&#xD;
      enfortumab vedotin, investigator decision or consent withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be followed post-treatment every 4 months via disease assessment or&#xD;
      telephone contact to obtain information on disease progression and death.&#xD;
