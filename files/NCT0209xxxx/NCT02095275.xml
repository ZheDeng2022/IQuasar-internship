  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is rapidly released by the ventricles of the heart in&#xD;
      response to myocardial stretch. This cardiac neurohormone is mostly elevated in patients with&#xD;
      fluid overload or myocardium dysfunction. BNP is a very useful and important marker. It can&#xD;
      predict mortality and cardiac events in patients in the ICU setting. In stable hemodialysis&#xD;
      patients with normal LV function on echocardiography, high BNP levels are likely the result&#xD;
      of blood volume expansion and require reduction in postdialysis dry weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the past, there were many methods to evaluate fluid status. Some are not reliable such as&#xD;
      central venous pressure or physical examination. Some are invasive and expensive such as Swan&#xD;
      Ganz、PiCCO catheter or bioimpedance device. Nevertheless, About the relationship between BNP&#xD;
      and fluid status, a study found a significant relation between bioimpedance-derived body&#xD;
      composition (BC) (fluid distribution) parameters and BNP concentrations. This relationship&#xD;
      was independent of the cardiac history of the patient and suggests that the natriuretic&#xD;
      peptide levels are to some degree modifiable by changing a patient's fluid distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators want to observe that if the level of BNP can predict the&#xD;
      occurrence of acute kidney injury and the need of renal replacement therapy. Besides, the&#xD;
      investigators also want to see if BNP can be a useful and convenient marker to guide&#xD;
      adjustment of optimal fluid status and then to improve outcome.&#xD;

      patients with normal LV function on echocardiography, high BNP levels are likely the result&#xD;
      of blood volume expansion and require reduction in postdialysis dry weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, ample recent data have highlighted the role of ﬂuid accumulation on&#xD;
      mortality and non-recovery of kidney function in critically ill patients with acute kidney&#xD;
      injury (AKI). In the past, there were many methods to evaluate fluid status. Some are not&#xD;
      reliable such as central venous pressure or physical examination. Some are invasive and&#xD;
      expensive such as Swan Ganz、PiCCO catheter or bioimpedance device. Nevertheless, About the&#xD;
      relationship between BNP and fluid status, a study found a significant relation between&#xD;
      bioimpedance-derived body composition (BC) (fluid distribution) parameters and BNP&#xD;

      suggests that the natriuretic peptide levels are to some degree modifiable by changing a&#xD;
      patient's fluid distribution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we want to observe that if the level of BNP can predict the occurrence of&#xD;
      acute kidney injury and the need of renal replacement therapy. Besides, we also want to see&#xD;
      if BNP can be a useful and convenient marker to guide adjustment of optimal fluid status and&#xD;
      then to improve outcome.&#xD;
