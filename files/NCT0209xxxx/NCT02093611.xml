  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) supplementation will be able to enhance&#xD;
      motor unit recruitment while simultaneously blunting the decline in power and reaction time&#xD;
      that is typically seen during repetitive sprints. This will give researchers a better&#xD;
      understanding of the mechanism by which ATP supplementation can augment power, especially&#xD;
      under high fatiguing conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy participants of similar training status as previously tested will be enrolled into&#xD;
      the study. The participants will be randomly assigned to either placebo supplementation or to&#xD;
      400 mg ATP per day for 14 days. The supplements will be taken in the morning and the last&#xD;
      dose will be taken 30 min prior to testing on the last day. Testing will be performed at&#xD;
      baseline and after the 14 days of supplementation. Ten successive sprints will be conducted&#xD;
      on the Wingate apparatus as this has been previously demonstrated to decrease muscle&#xD;
      excitability. After the sprints, muscle excitability, reaction time, and vertical jump power&#xD;
      will be measured. In addition a blood sample will be obtained before and after&#xD;
      supplementation and complete blood hematology and chemistry analyses will be performed. It is&#xD;
      expected that ATP supplementation may help maintain muscle excitability and power after the&#xD;
      successive sprint sessions.&#xD;
