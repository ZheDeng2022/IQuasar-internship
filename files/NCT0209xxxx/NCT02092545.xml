  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Up to ten retired NFL players will receive a comprehensive and monitored weight loss program&#xD;
      using a protocol that has been established at the TGH+USF Bariatric Center. A low calorie&#xD;
      diet with meal replacements will be used and over the course of the study the participants&#xD;
      will be taught to eat low calorie nutritious foods. The sessions will teach proper eating&#xD;
      habits, stress control, and skills to maintain a healthy weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The length of the study is 6 months. Treatment will last 24 weeks, the participants will&#xD;
      attend group sessions (60-90 mins.) on a weekly basis for weeks 1-12 and then every other&#xD;
      week for weeks 14-24, for a total of 18 treatments. Treatment will include meal replacement,&#xD;
      education on nutrition and proper eating habits as well as behavior modification and skills&#xD;
      which is known to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be scheduled to come to the Bariatric Center for the first&#xD;
      assessment/screening and for the consenting process. TGH+USF Bariatric Center has dedicated&#xD;
      clinical space in their suite with private exam rooms, an education classroom, and private&#xD;
      testing room.&#xD;
