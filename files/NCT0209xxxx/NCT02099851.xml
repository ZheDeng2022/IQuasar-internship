  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, observational, multicenter trial to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of selective endovascular unilateral carotid body ablation in patients with&#xD;
      treatment-resistant hypertension. All patients will be followed for two (2) years following&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a new method of treatment, unilateral carotid body ablation, for&#xD;
      treatment- resistant hypertensive patients to restore more normal blood pressure control,&#xD;
      which will reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in these patients. This strategy&#xD;
      will increase the number of therapeutic options available to many patients and their&#xD;
      physicians as well as offering the potential of normal blood pressure to those patients in&#xD;
      whom blood pressure remains elevated despite vigorous, drug or device based therapies.&#xD;
