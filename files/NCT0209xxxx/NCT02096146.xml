      This study will compare TMT Fusion Plate versus two crossed screws for the fixation of first&#xD;
      tarsometatarsal joint arthrodesis. Patients who meet eligibility criteria will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of these two treatment options.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tarsometatarsal joint arthrodesis is a common procedure which can be performed using various&#xD;
      devices such as screws, plates or both. The Tarsometatarsal Fusion Plate from &quot;DePuySynthes&quot;&#xD;
      is a new device designed to encourage bony fusion of the 1st TMT joint, and is expected to&#xD;
      lead to earlier fusion compared to the current standard of care of using 2 crossed screws.&#xD;
      This is expected, in turn, to result in an earlier reduction in pain and an earlier return to&#xD;
      full activity. At this time there is insufficient data directly comparing outcome following&#xD;
      surgery for patients treated with screws or plates, and a study protocol which produces a&#xD;
      higher level of evidence is therefore necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main aim of this study is to compare patient-reported outcome following surgery for&#xD;
      patients undergoing joint arthrodesis using the TMT Fusion plate versus screws only. It is&#xD;
      expected that surgery will improve patient-reported outcome similarly for both treatment&#xD;
      groups in the long-term, but that the improvement will occur earlier for the plate group. For&#xD;
      this study patient-reported outcome will be assessed by the walking/standing and pain domain&#xD;
      scores of the Manchester Oxford Foot Questionnaire (MOXFQ). An earlier improvement in any of&#xD;
      these two domains would be considered to be valuable. The primary analysis will therefore&#xD;
      compare the time to a minimal clinically relevant improvement for any of the two MOXFQ&#xD;
      domains for patients treated with TMT fusion plate versus patients treated with only screws&#xD;
      during the first 12 months following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An economic evaluation from a societal perspective will determine the incremental&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of the TMT fusion plate versus the 2 crossed screws technique for 1st TMT&#xD;
      joint fusion. Therefore a randomized controlled trial will be conducted, where&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes as well as clinical outcome parameters will be assessed.&#xD;
