    <textblock>
      Cryptococcal meningitis is one of the most common central nervous system infections among&#xD;
      HIV-infected patients. The outcome is generally severe. This study aims to determine&#xD;
      long-term survival rate among HIV-infected CM patients in the era of antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
      (ART). The secondary objectives are to clarify outcomes of CM and determine prognostic&#xD;
      factors.&#xD;

      Study site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study are conducted at the Division of Infectious Diseases, Department of Medicine,&#xD;
      Faculty of Medicine, Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is obtained by using EPI Info program. Anticipated population proportion P&#xD;
      which will be the major outcome of CM, the survival rate was 63% in Thailand (Chottanapund S,&#xD;
      Singhasivanon P, Kaewkungwal J, Chamroonswasdi K, Manosuthi W. Survival time of HIV-infected&#xD;
      patients with cryptococcal meningitis. J Med Assoc Thai. 2007 Oct;90(10):2104-11. PubMed&#xD;
      PMID: 18041430). At the effect size of 80%, confidence level at 95% (P = 0.05), deviation&#xD;
      error of allowanced of 5% and 210 expects HIV infected patients with CM during study period&#xD;
      at Ramathibodi Hospital, the estimated sample size is 132 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death case: Death case is CM patient who died for any reason during the period of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survival case: Survival case is CM patient who did not die during the period of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relapse case: This refers to a patient who developed a new episode of CM after clinical&#xD;
      manifestations had disappeared and CSF culture had become negative, and confirmed by positive&#xD;
      CSF culture for Cryptococcus neoformans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IRIS case: This refers to a patient who developed a new episode of clinical meningitis after&#xD;
      clinical manifestations stemming from a previous episode of CM had disappeared and the&#xD;
      patient had been started ART, and defined as negative CSF culture for Cryptococcus&#xD;
      neoformans. Alternative etiology which presents symptoms similar to CM must be ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcome parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short-term outcome: Short-term outcome is defined as the outcome that happened within 1 year&#xD;
      of follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term outcome: Long-term outcome is defined as all outcomes that happened after 1 year of&#xD;
      follow up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Margin period to evaluate the blood findings at AmB induction therapy initiation is defined&#xD;
      as within 3 months from the exact date of AmB induction therapy initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Margin period to evaluate the parameters at AmB induction therapy completion is defined as&#xD;
      within 7 days from the exact date of AmB induction therapy completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Margin period to evaluate the CSF findings at ART initiation is defined as within 1 month&#xD;
      from the exact date of ART initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Margin period to evaluate the blood findings at ART initiation is defined as from 3 months&#xD;
      before to 1 month after the exact date of ART initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Margin period to evaluate the parameters at secondary FLCZ prophylaxis completion is defined&#xD;
      as within 3 months from the exact date of secondary FLCZ prophylaxis completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medical records of those diagnosed with HIV associated CM is retrieved from the medical&#xD;
      record department in Ramathibodi Hospital. Then the inclusion and exclusion criteria are&#xD;
      checked. We review at least 132 cases. The information from the medical records which pass&#xD;
      the criteria is extracted and transferred to the case report form. Then data entry is carried&#xD;
      out with coding and verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be computed by means of the descriptive statistical methods as the following&#xD;
      values: frequency distribution, proportion, rate, median and range. To compare demographic&#xD;
      and clinical characteristics, we will use chi-square tests or Fisher's exact tests for&#xD;
      categorical variables and student's t tests or Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables.&#xD;
      Cox's proportional hazards model and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis will be used to evaluate&#xD;
      factors associated with outcomes. Hazard ratio, odds ratio and 95% CI will be calculated and&#xD;
      used as a measure of the strength of the association between the outcome variables and their&#xD;
      predictors. A two-tailed alpha level of 0.05 will be used to determine statistical&#xD;
      significance. Statistical analyses will be performed with the statistical program, SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical committee approval:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a retrospective study, we review patients' medical records only. No patient are directly&#xD;
      involved in this study and therefore no informed consent is obtained. The proposal is&#xD;
      reviewed by the Ethical Committee of the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University,&#xD;
      for clearance. Data collection was started after the protocol is ethically approved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names or any clues leading to the identification of the patients are not be recorded in&#xD;
      CRF (case record form). Only code numbers are recorded in CRF. The information of patient's&#xD;
      identification and code number are kept separately. The results are presented as medical data&#xD;
      with no personal identifying information. Authorized person helps to collect data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research funds:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Funding for the study is provided by the Faculty of Tropical Medicine, Mahidol University,&#xD;
      Bangkok, Thailand.&#xD;
