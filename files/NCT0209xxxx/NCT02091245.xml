  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves participants who have acute lymphoblastic or acute myelogenous&#xD;
      leukemia that has relapsed or has become resistant (or refractory) to standard therapies.&#xD;
      This research study is evaluating a drug called KPT-330. Laboratory and other studies suggest&#xD;
      that the study drug, KPT-330, may prevent leukemia cells from growing and may lead to the&#xD;
      destruction of leukemia cells. It is thought that KPT-330 activates cellular processes that&#xD;
      increase the death of leukemia cells. The main goal of this study is to evaluate the side&#xD;
      effects of KPT-330 when it is administered to children and adolescents with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory leukemia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are trying to determine a safe dose of KPT-330 and will be giving&#xD;
      participants different dose levels of the study drug. Three to six participants will receive&#xD;
      the starting dose of the drug. If the side effects are not too severe, the next group of&#xD;
      participants will take the study drug at a higher dose level. Up to 3 dose levels of the&#xD;
      study drug will be tested, but once each participant has been assigned a dose level, the&#xD;
      participant will always receive the same dose. The highest dose that people can be given&#xD;
      safely is called the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). Once the MTD is determined, up to 10&#xD;
      additional participants will receive that dose to further study the drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants between the age of ≥18 months (540 days) and ≤ 21 years with relapsed (second or&#xD;
      subsequent relapse) or refractory ALL or AML will be eligible to enroll. KPT-330 will be&#xD;
      administered twice a week on Days 1 and 3 for four weeks (a cycle is 4 weeks). All&#xD;
      participants will receive intrathecal chemotherapy on Day 1 of each cycle. Participants with&#xD;
      CNS-2 disease will receive additional doses of IT chemo. Pharmacokinetic (PK) samples will be&#xD;
      collected during Cycle 1 on Days 1-3 and 15. PK samples will be collected during Cycle 2 on&#xD;
      Day 15. Pharmacodynamic (PD) samples will be collected during Cycle 1 on Days 1-3. PD samples&#xD;
      will be collected during Cycle 2 on Day 15. Additional optional correlative biology sample&#xD;
      will be collected. Participants are monitored closely for adverse events. Participants will&#xD;
      have physical exams and blood work more than once a week during all cycles.&#xD;
