  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized, double-blind (evaluator-blind), vehicle-controlled study of 50&#xD;
      enrolled subjects. Adult subjects (greater than 18 years old) who present with a mildly&#xD;
      infected diabetic foot ulcer (IDSA criteria) having full thickness (i.e., through the dermis&#xD;
      but not involving joint capsule, tendon, and bone). Subjects must also provide informed&#xD;
      consent and meet all other entry criteria to be enrolled and randomly assigned to receive&#xD;
      PluroGel N or PluroGel vehicle.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Subjects must have a full thickness (i.e., extending through dermis but not&#xD;
                  involving tendon, bone, or joint capsule) ulcer on the foot distal to the&#xD;
                  malleoli with a surface area ≥1 cm2 after the wound has undergone appropriate&#xD;
                  debridement. Subjects must have localized mild infection of the ulcer, as defined&#xD;
                  by the IDSA criteria as per Appendix C, with in the PGN1300 Protocol, which the&#xD;
                  investigator believes would ordinarily be treated on an outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        IDSA mild infection of an ulcer is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        The presence of ≥2 of the following items:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Local swelling or induration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Erythema&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Local tenderness or pain&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Local warmth&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Purulent discharge (thick, opaque to white or sanguineous secretion) Local infection&#xD;
             involving only the skin and the subcutaneous tissue. If erythema, must be &gt;0.5 cm to&#xD;
             ≤2 cm around the ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diabetic Foot Infection-General Parameters Score of at least 2 must be obtained&#xD;
                  in order to be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Diabetic Foot Infection-Wound Size Score of at least 1 must be obtained in order&#xD;
                  to be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The diagnosis of mild infection must be confirmed immediately following the Day 0&#xD;
                  (Enrollment Visit) debridement, although pre-debridement purulence is to be&#xD;
                  counted as one manifestation of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with IDSA-defined moderate infection as per Appendix C, including cellulitis&#xD;

                  chills, tachycardia, hypotension, confusion, vomiting, leukocytosis, acidosis,&#xD;
                  hyperglycemia, or azotemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects with systemic inflammatory response signs, as manifested by ≥2 of the&#xD;
