      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of onalespib when given together&#xD;
      with dabrafenib and trametinib in treating patients with BRAF-mutant melanoma or solid tumors&#xD;
      that have spread to another place in the body (metastatic) or cannot be removed by surgery.&#xD;
      Onalespib, dabrafenib, and trametinib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of&#xD;
      the enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), toxicity, and safety profile of onalespib&#xD;
      (AT13387) given weekly in combination with dabrafenib and trametinib in patients with&#xD;
      BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To obtain preliminary estimates of the objective response rate (ORR) and progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) and document the 6-month PFS and 1-year overall survival (OS) of patients with&#xD;
      BRAF-mutant metastatic or unresectable melanoma treated with AT13387 given weekly in&#xD;
      combination with dabrafenib and trametinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To describe the pharmacokinetics of treatment with dabrafenib, trametinib, and AT13387.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of onalespib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive dabrafenib orally (PO) twice daily (BID), trametinib PO once daily (QD) on&#xD;
      days 1-28, and onalespib intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat&#xD;
      every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 28 days and every 6 months&#xD;
      for up to 2 years.&#xD;
