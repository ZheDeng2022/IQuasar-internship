             report all serious adverse events (for example, resulting in hospitalization) for the&#xD;
             duration of the subject's participation in the study (6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to defer blood, bone marrow, and organ donation for 1 year after receipt of skin&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior history of Q fever disease or vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant abnormal lab results (including evidence of hepatitis C,&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Heart valve disease: prosthetic heart valve or clinically significant heart murmur.&#xD;
             (If a murmur is detected on examination, an echocardiogram may be obtained or subject&#xD;
             may be referred to a cardiologist to determine clinical significance.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aneurysm/vascular graft.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Joint prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of chronic fatigue syndrome (or positive by chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS)&#xD;
