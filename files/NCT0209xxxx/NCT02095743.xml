  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adjuvant chemotherapy is frequently proposed to patients presenting early breast cancer, in&#xD;
      case of high risk of recurrence (large tumors, node involvement, high grade…). Due to its&#xD;
      toxicity toward veins, chemotherapy must be administered through a central venous device.&#xD;
      Today, one can use either an implanted port or a PICC line (Peripherally Inserted Central&#xD;
      Catheter). A PICC line is easier to implant and to explant, but has to be flushed every week&#xD;
      and may impact daily life (no swimming, some clothes may not fit). On the other hand, a port&#xD;
      is subcutaneous and lets patients lead a normal life, but its implant and explant require a&#xD;
      cutaneous incision with possible complications (bleeding, pain, infection). For both venous&#xD;
      devices, complications such as thrombosis or infection may happen. Published data comparing&#xD;
      the two devices are heterogeneous and do not often distinguish patients treated for different&#xD;
      diseases at various stages. Empirically in daily practice, for long term use (&gt;6 months) a&#xD;
      port is usually preferred, whereas for short-term treatments (&lt;6 weeks) a PICC line is used.&#xD;
      In the case of Her2 negative early breast cancer, adjuvant chemotherapy usually lasts 4 to 5&#xD;
      months. There is no scientific evidence for preferring one device to the other for these&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to prospectively compare the patients' satisfaction and tolerance of&#xD;
      each of the two devices.&#xD;

      The intravenous device will be randomly attributed. The adjuvant chemotherapy regimen will be&#xD;
      selected according the standards of the center ( 6 cycles of FEC100 or 3 cycles of FEC100&#xD;
      then 3 cycles of Taxotere (docetaxel). The patient will be followed as per center's standards&#xD;
      and visits (prior, during and after every drug administration, then monthly for six months).&#xD;
      All Adverse Events will be reported.&#xD;
