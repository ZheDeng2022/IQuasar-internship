  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Studies have shown that individuals who have suffered a spinal cord injury are at an&#xD;
      increased risk of Vitamin D deficiency compared to able-bodied individuals. It has recently&#xD;
      been shown that Vitamin D deficiency is linked to a large number of diseases and conditions,&#xD;
      including chronic lung disease, vascular problems, and insulin resistance. If this common&#xD;
      nutritional deficiency is proven to be the cause of some of these diseases and conditions in&#xD;
      persons with SCI, then it may easily be remedied with a cheap and effective therapeutic&#xD;
      approach: vitamin D replacement therapy. Because of the high prevalence of vitamin D&#xD;
      deficiency in persons with SCI, this therapy alone or in combination with other treatment&#xD;
      options will be expected to significantly improve overall well being in the SCI population,&#xD;
      decrease hospitalization rate, and the lower the financial burden of care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vitamin D deficiency is prevalent in individuals with Spinal Cord Injury (SCI). Recent&#xD;
      studies have linked vitamin D with the prevention and/or treatment of a wide range of&#xD;
      diseases, including chronic lung diseases. Patients with chronic lung diseases appear to be&#xD;
      at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency for reasons that are not clear. Chronic lung&#xD;
      diseases such as asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) have been linked to&#xD;
      vitamin D on a genetic basis. A recent observational study found a significant association&#xD;
      between vitamin D deficiency and decreased pulmonary function in a large able-bodied&#xD;
      population. The exact mechanisms involved have not been identified, but it has been&#xD;
      postulated that vitamin D possesses a range of anti-inflammatory properties involving&#xD;
      modulation of oxidative stress, or, possibly, protease/antiprotease balance and tissue&#xD;
      damage/repair, mechanisms that have been shown to be important in the pathogenesis of chronic&#xD;
      lung diseases. The relationship between vitamin D and the immune system is of utmost&#xD;
      importance given that individuals with high cervical lesions express many obstructive aspects&#xD;
      of pulmonary physiology commonly observed in individuals with asthma, in whom airway&#xD;
      inflammation represents an underlying pathophysiological mechanism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to a high prevalence of vitamin D deficiency, persons with SCI have a higher&#xD;
      prevalence of insulin resistance (IR), impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      (DM). In the general population, vitamin D deficiency has been shown to be associated with&#xD;
      IR, IGT and DM. If treatment of vitamin D deficiency in persons with SCI is shown to be&#xD;
      associated with improvement in insulin sensitivity and reductions in impaired glucose&#xD;
      tolerance or DM, then progression to more severe carbohydrate disorders may be delayed or&#xD;
      prevented.&#xD;
