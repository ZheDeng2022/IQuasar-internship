  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this Registry is to detect and describe any abnormal pregnancy outcomes,&#xD;
      including teratogenicity, in females intentionally or unintentionally exposed to Boostrix&#xD;
      during their pregnancies in the US. The Registry requires voluntary, prospective reporting of&#xD;
      eligible pregnancies by patients and health care providers (HCPs). Data such as vaccination&#xD;
      with Boostrix during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception, potential confounding&#xD;
      factors (such as exposure to other medications) and information related to the outcome of the&#xD;
      pregnancy will be collected prospectively&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Registry was originally initiated on 03 May 2005, as part of a program of enhanced&#xD;
      pharmacovigilance. Following new European Union Pharmacovigilance legislation, pregnancy&#xD;
      registries are to be considered as post-authorization safety studies (PASS). The ongoing&#xD;
      Registry will therefore be converted into a PASS study in Q1 2014.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposed pregnancies reported to the Registry before the transition into a PASS (between 03&#xD;
      May 2005 and Q1 2014), from which data were collected and analyzed prospectively, will also&#xD;
      be included in the analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some pregnancy exposures may be reported after pregnancy outcome has been identified&#xD;
      (retrospective reports). The Registry will capture retrospective reports, but these reports&#xD;
      will not be included in the analyses of prospective reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy outcome data will be collected using questionnaires within 2 months of the&#xD;
      estimated date of delivery (EDD) and approximately 6 months and 12 months after the EDD (for&#xD;
      all live births for whom the contact details of their HCP will be available) to ascertain the&#xD;
      presence of birth defects not diagnosed before, from Q1 2014 to Q3 2019.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        A subject will be included in the Registry if all of the following criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Exposure to vaccine occurs during pregnancy or within 28 days preceding conception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is a US resident.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A HCP is identified (name, address and phone number).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject can be identified (by GSK or HCP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Data from registered subjects will be included in the analyses if the following criterion&#xD;
        is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Pregnancy is ongoing and the outcome is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Data from registered subjects will not be included in the analyses if the following&#xD;
        criterion is met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Outcome of pregnancy is known at the time of initial report. Types of known outcomes&#xD;
        include prenatal testing reports in which the results are abnormal or outside the reference&#xD;
        range, indicating possible abnormality in the fetus. Typically, pregnancies &gt; 16 weeks&#xD;
        gestation will have undergone prenatal testing that can identify whether a child has&#xD;
        congenital abnormalities.&#xD;
