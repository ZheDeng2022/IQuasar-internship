  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regorafenib is an oral medication that can interfere with cancer cell growth and reduce the&#xD;
      growth of blood vessels around tumors. This study will help find out if regorafenib is a&#xD;
      useful drug for treating patients with adenoid cystic carcinomas. Regorafenib has been&#xD;
      approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for use in other cancers, but remains an&#xD;
      experimental drug that has not yet been approved for use in adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the patient will initially be treated with a dose of regorafenib that is lower&#xD;
      than what the FDA approved for other cancers in an attempt to decrease the risk of side&#xD;
      effects. It is possible that this lower starting dose may not be as effective as the higher&#xD;
      FDA approved dose. If the patient does well with the lower dose for at least a month on&#xD;
      treatment, the physician may consider increasing the dose to the FDA approved dose.&#xD;

    <description>All eligible patients will receive a starting regorafenib dose of 120 mg daily taken orally for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle. Patients for whom regorafenib dose reduction was not performed or required may have their treatment dose increased to the FDA-approved dose of 160 mg daily orally for 3 weeks in a 4-week cycle in cycle #2 or beyond (this is not mandatory). RECIST v1.1 tumor assessments will be made at baseline (CT or MRI) and then approximately every 2 cycles (or every 8 weeks (+/- 1 week)). After 10 months, imaging will be done every 3 cycles (or every 12 weeks (+/- 1 week)). Patients may remain on study until progression of disease or unacceptable toxicity</description>

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have pathologically or cytologically confirmed adenoid cystic carcinoma.&#xD;
             Cancers arising from non-salivary gland primary sites are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recurrent and/or metastatic disease not amenable to potentially&#xD;
             curative surgery or radiotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 2 weeks must have elapsed since the end of prior systemic treatment (4 weeks&#xD;
             for bevacizumab- containing regimens) or radiotherapy with resolution of all&#xD;
             treatment-related toxicity to NCI CTCAE Version 4.0 grade ≤1 (or tolerable grade 2) or&#xD;
             back to baseline (except for alopecia, lymphopenia, or hypothyroidism). Any number of&#xD;
             prior therapies for recurrent/metastatic ACC are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have RECIST v1.1 measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that&#xD;
             can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded&#xD;
             for nonnodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥ 20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥ 10 mm with spiral CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have documentation of a new or progressive lesion on a radiologic&#xD;
             imaging study performed within 6 months prior to study enrollment (progression of&#xD;
             disease over any interval is allowed) and/or new/worsening disease related symptoms&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to study enrollment. Note: This assessment will be performed by&#xD;
             the treating investigator. Evidence of progression by RECIST criteria is not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have archival tissue from the primary tumor or metastases available for&#xD;
             correlative studies. Either a paraffin block or twenty unstained slides are&#xD;
             acceptable. If twenty slides are not available, a lesser amount may be acceptable&#xD;
             after discussion with the Principal Investigator, Dr. Alan L. Ho.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must agree to undergo biopsy of a malignant lesion. Biopsies do not need to&#xD;
             be done if either the investigator or person performing the biopsy judges that no&#xD;
             tumor is accessible for biopsy or that biopsy poses too great of a risk to the&#xD;
             patient. Patients may also be exempt if frozen tumor tissue has been collected within&#xD;
             12 months of study enrollment that the Principal Investigator deems is&#xD;
             appropriate/sufficient for analysis on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

                  (ALT) and aspartate amino-transferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects&#xD;
                  with liver involvement of their cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Alkaline phosphatase limit ≤ 2.5 x ULN (≤ 5 x ULN for subjects with liver&#xD;
                  involvement of their cancer)&#xD;

                  be allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test performed&#xD;
             within 2 weeks prior to the start of study drug. Post-menopausal women (defined as no&#xD;
