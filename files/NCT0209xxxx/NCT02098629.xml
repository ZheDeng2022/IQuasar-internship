      Heart attack is the leading cause of death in the developed world. Following heart attack,&#xD;
      re-establishing blood flow in a clogged heart vessel using percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      (PCI) is the standard of care. This therapy is called reperfusion therapy. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      reperfusion therapy itself poses additional heart muscle damaging effect, a process called&#xD;
      reperfusion injury. Excessive reperfusion injury can offset the net benefit of heart vessel&#xD;
      blood flow restoration in patients with heart attacks. For those heart attack survivors,&#xD;
      massive reperfusion injury can contribute to heart failure which carries high risk for death&#xD;
      and long-term disabilities. To date, there is no drug available that can reduce reperfusion&#xD;
      injury in heart attack patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our group has demonstrated in a preclinical study that combining two available medications&#xD;
      (milrinone and esmolol) when given right before the onset of reperfusion therapy greatly&#xD;
      reduces heart muscle damage in an animal heart attack model. Furthermore, in a clinical&#xD;
      safety, we demonstrated that combination therapy with milrinone and esmolol is safe in&#xD;
      patients with heart attack undergoing PCI. If the heart-protective effect observed in our&#xD;
      preclinical study can be replicated in human subjects, this proposed therapy will become the&#xD;
      first of this kind to treat clinical reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present trial is a proof-of-concept study to determine whether the combination&#xD;
      administration of milrinone and esmolol at the onset of reperfusion reduces the heart muscle&#xD;
      damage in heart attack patients who receive reperfusion therapy with PCI.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute myocardial infarction (AMI) is the leading cause of death in the developed world.&#xD;
      Following AMI, reperfusion therapy with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the&#xD;
      standard of care. PCI has been shown in meta-analyses to decrease mortality compared with&#xD;
      thrombolysis. Despite this improvement in outcome, mortality after AMI remains 4-6% in&#xD;
      general population. PCI has not been effective in reducing mortality in elderly patients. In&#xD;
      fact, emergent reperfusion therapy may increase mortality in aging population. The worsening&#xD;
      clinical outcome following reperfusion therapy in aging population suggests that reperfusion&#xD;
      therapy per se actually exacerbates heart muscle damage, a well-defined clinical process&#xD;
      called myocardial reperfusion injury. Reperfusion injury poses a continuous (hours to days)&#xD;
      heart muscle damage process following PCI or thrombosis. Excessive reperfusion injury can&#xD;
      offset the net benefit of coronary blood flow restoration in AMI patients. For those AMI&#xD;
      survivors, massive heart muscle damage due to ischemia/reperfusion injury leads to congestive&#xD;
      heart failure (CHF) which carries high risk for sudden death and long-term morbidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inevitable lethal reperfusion injury following reperfusion remains an unsolved clinical&#xD;
      problem. To date, there is no drug available that can reduce reperfusion injury associated&#xD;
      with PCI or other modalities of coronary artery revascularization. A recent preclinical study&#xD;
      from our group demonstrates that combination therapy with milrinone+esmolol when given before&#xD;
      the onset of reperfusion reduces infarct-size in an animal model with AMI followed by&#xD;
      reperfusion. In a phase I clinical trial from our team, it has been shown that combination&#xD;
      therapy with milrinone+esmolol is safe in patients with AMI undergoing PCI. If the&#xD;
      infarct-size-limiting effect observed in our preclinical data can be replicated in human&#xD;
      subjects, this proposed therapy will become the first of this kind to treat clinical&#xD;
      reperfusion injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed project is a proof-of-concept study to determine whether the combination&#xD;
      administration of milrinone+esmolol at the onset of reperfusion reduces the infarct size in&#xD;
      patients with S-T elevation MI (STEMI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Targeted Enrollment Total enrollment will be 60 patients (30 active/30 placebo) based on&#xD;
      power calculation for achieving 30% reduction in cardiac biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion &amp; Exclusion Criteria Men and women, 18 years of age or older, who present within 12&#xD;
      hours after the onset of chest pain, who has ST-segment elevation of more than 0.1 mV in two&#xD;
      contiguous leads, and for whom the clinical decision is made to treat with PCI will be&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment. Patients with cardiac arrest, ventricular fibrillation, cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock, stent thrombosis, previous acute myocardial infarction, or angina within 48 hours&#xD;
      before infarction will not included in the study. Patients with occlusion of the left main or&#xD;
      left circumflex coronary artery or with evidence of coronary collaterals to the region at&#xD;
      risk on initial coronary angiography (at the time of admission) will be excluded. Patients&#xD;
      who are pregnant will not be included. Finally, patients who have any disorder that is&#xD;
      associated with immunologic dysfunction (e.g., cancer, lymphoma, a positive serologic test&#xD;
      for the human immunodeficiency virus, or hepatitis) more recently than 6 months before&#xD;
      presentation will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Infusion Protocol After coronary angiography has been performed but before the stent is&#xD;
      implanted, patients who meet the enrollment criteria will be randomly assigned to either the&#xD;
      milrinone+esmolol group or placebo group. Randomization was performed with the use of a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 5 minutes before stent deployment, the patients in the milrinone+esmolol group&#xD;
      start to receive continuous intravenous drug infusion for 10 minutes. Milrinone and esmolol&#xD;
      (each in 10 ml volume) will be placed in two separate syringes being connected to their&#xD;
      respective venous catheters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage of study drugs: Syringe #1 Milrinone 5 ug/kg/min Syringe #2 Esmolol 10 ug/kg/min&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above dosage selection in based on our published clinical phase I study in which&#xD;
      combination drug infusion produces only a minimal change in hemodynamics without other safety&#xD;
      issue during PCI therapy in patients with STEMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary &amp; Secondary Endpoints The primary endpoint is the infarct-size reduction as assessed&#xD;
      by measurement of cardiac biomarker creatine kinase (CK). The principal secondary endpoints&#xD;
      are the reduction of CK-MB and troponin I. Blood samples will be collected at admission and&#xD;
      repeatedly at 4-hr, 12-hr, 24-hr, 36-hr, 48-Hr and 72-hr, respectively. The area under the&#xD;
      curve (AUC) (expressed in arbitrary units) for CK, CK-MB and troponin I release will be&#xD;
      measured in each patient by computerized planimetry. The other secondary end point is the&#xD;
      infarct-size as measured by the area of delayed hyperenhancement that was seen on cardiac&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), assessed on day 5 after infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Endpoints We will record the cumulative incidence of major adverse events that occurred&#xD;
      within the first 48 hours after reperfusion, including death, heart failure, acute myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, stroke, recurrent ischemia, the need for repeat revascularization, renal&#xD;
      insufficiency, vascular complications, and bleeding. We also specifically assess&#xD;
      infarct-related adverse events, including heart failure and ventricular fibrillation. In&#xD;
      addition, one month after AMI, cardiac events will be recorded and global left ventricular&#xD;
      function will be assessed by echocardiography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical and Analytical Plans&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. General Considerations The primary and secondary endpoints for the efficacy of drug&#xD;
           study will be analysed using the appropriate statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety Analyses All clinical signs/symptoms, known adverse reactions of the trial&#xD;
           medications, medical events will be monitored and recorded. They will be analysed using&#xD;
           the appropriate statistical methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS Informed Consent The investigator or his designated staff will collect&#xD;
      written consent from each patient before the study being performed. Prior to this, the&#xD;
      investigator or his/her delegate will inform each patient of the objectives, benefits, risks&#xD;
      and requirements imposed by the study, as well as the nature of the study products.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be provided with an information and consent form in clear, simple language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be given ample time to inquire about details of the study and to decide&#xD;
      whether or not to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two original information and consent forms will be completed, dated and signed personally by&#xD;
      the patient and by the person responsible for collecting the informed consent. If the patient&#xD;
      is unable to read, an impartial witness will be present during the entire informed consent&#xD;
      discussion. The patient must give consent orally and, if capable of doing so, complete, sign&#xD;
      and personally date the information and consent form. The witness must then complete, sign&#xD;
      and date the form together with the person responsible for collecting the informed consent.&#xD;
      The patient will be given one signed original consent form; the second original will be kept&#xD;
      by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality of Data and Patient Records All evaluation forms, reports and other records&#xD;
      will be coded to maintain subject confidentiality. The research data will be stored at the&#xD;
      stand-alone laptop of PI with password protected. Clinical information will not be released&#xD;
      without written permission of the subject, except as necessary for monitoring by relevant&#xD;
      authorities.&#xD;
