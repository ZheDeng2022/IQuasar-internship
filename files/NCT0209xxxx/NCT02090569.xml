    <textblock>
      Three decades since its comprehensive description (Taylor et al., 1971), focal cortical&#xD;
      dysplasia (FCD) remains an enigmatic condition. FCD may cause severe refractory epilepsy that&#xD;
      can be directly life threatening. Preoperative neuroimaging usually includes high-resolution&#xD;
      MR imaging, which can reveal only 60 to 80% of cortical abnormalities in patients with FCD.&#xD;
      When antiepileptic drugs fail to bring complete seizure freedom in FCD patients, surgical&#xD;
      resection of the FCD is inevitable. Many patients, especially those with normal MR imaging&#xD;
      results, undergo additional diagnostic procedures. Scalp EEG is frequently used and was one&#xD;
      of the more important modalities during early surgical series. Approximately one half to two&#xD;
      thirds of patients with abnormal EEG findings have a regional ictal abnormality. In some&#xD;
      cases, intracranial electrophysiological recordings, most commonly with grid arrays, are&#xD;
      used. Chronic recording allows identification of eloquent cortex areas, in addition to&#xD;
      defining the epileptogenic region. The &quot;eloquent brain&quot; refers to the parts of the brain that&#xD;
      allows the interaction with and the process of surrounding environment, via the senses,&#xD;
      motion, language, memory and the purposeful use of tools. Nevertheless, all these techniques&#xD;
      are either invasive or have a spatiotemporal resolution too poor to identify precisely the&#xD;
      epileptic lesion deep in the brain. Hence, large resection of lesion areas, such as&#xD;
      lobectomies and even hemispherectomies, are performed with a high risk of side effects&#xD;
      including aphasia, partial face paralysis and hemiplegia depending on the localization of the&#xD;
      lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Navigable three-dimensional (3D)-MRI (based on Neuronavigation system) is currently used at&#xD;
      the Sainte Anne hospital for planning and guiding during resection but neurosurgeons often&#xD;
      complains about poor resolution and non-real-time imaging. While the use of surgical&#xD;
      navigation has been an important advance in brain surgery, its utility is limited by the&#xD;
      phenomenon known as brain shift. Whenever the brain is exposed, cerebral spinal fluid (CSF)&#xD;
      is lost. Additionally, after the start of resectioning, the position of the surgical field&#xD;
      can shift by centimeters, compared to the pre-surgery position. Brain shift makes it&#xD;
      potentially hazardous to rely on preoperative images to determine the location of residual&#xD;
      tumors. The only way to deal with brain shift and maintain accurate neuronavigation is with&#xD;
      intraoperative imaging to enhance resection of the pathologic tissue in FCD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously, the investigators demonstrated the feasibility of their approach by monitoring&#xD;
      the hemodynamic responses during drug-induced epileptic seizures in preclinical models using&#xD;
      functional micro-Doppler Sonography (fmDS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are now developing this new tool combining a navigable three-dimensional&#xD;
      (3D)-ultrasound interface to correct in real-time the brain shift (B-mode) with the&#xD;
      near-real-time identification with unprecedented resolution of the dysplasia foci based on&#xD;
      the specific hemodynamic signature of abnormal neurons.&#xD;
