    <textblock>
      Triple therapy (TT) comprising proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin 1g and clarithromycin&#xD;
      500mg twice daily has long been considered one of the standard treatment for H. pylori&#xD;
      infection as initial studies demonstrated success rates of &gt; 90% on per protocol analysis&#xD;
      (PP) and &gt; 80% on intention to treat (ITT) analysis. However increasing bacterial resistance,&#xD;
      especially to clarithromycin, has been reported and there are concerns that the efficacy of&#xD;
      TT has decreased. Sequential therapy (ST) is an alternative first line therapy that consists&#xD;
      of 5 days of treatment with a PPI and amoxicillin followed by 5-day treatment with the PPI&#xD;
      and clarithromycin and metronidazole. The rationale for this approach is that amoxicillin may&#xD;
      weaken the bacterial cell wall in the initial phase of treatment, and prevent the development&#xD;
      of drug efflux channels that inhibit clarithromycin from binding to ribosomes and thus help&#xD;
      to improve the efficacy of clarithromycin in the second phase of treatment. A recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis based on mainly European studies showed that the success rate of ST compared to&#xD;
      TT was 92.8 - 96% vs. 76.2 - 78.8%. Concomitant therapy (CT) is another alternative first&#xD;
      line treatment that consists of 10 days of PPI, amoxicillin, clarithromycin and&#xD;
      metronidazole. The rationale for using CT as a first line treatment option is to address the&#xD;
      possibility of clarithromycin resistance which is increasingly encountered in clinical&#xD;
      practice. Currently there are no randomized controlled studies that compared TT with ST in&#xD;
      Singapore, although both regimens are being used in routine clinical practice. The hypothesis&#xD;
      is that ST is superior to TT as first line treatment for H. pylori infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aim to compare 10-day TT versus 10-day ST versus 10-day CT as first line treatment&#xD;
      for H. pylori infection in Singapore.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background Helicobacter pylori is a common infection in Singapore with an overall&#xD;
      seroprevalence rate of 31%. The prevalence rate increases with age and exceeds 70% among&#xD;
      those more than 65 years of age (1). H pylori is a major pathogen and is associated with&#xD;
      development of peptic ulcer disease and gastric malignancies and successful H. pylori&#xD;
      eradication has been shown to be important for both primary and secondary prevention of these&#xD;
      diseases (2). Triple therapy (TT) comprising proton pump inhibitor (PPI), amoxicillin 1g and&#xD;
      clarithromycin 500mg twice daily has long been considered one of the standard treatment for&#xD;
      H. pylori infection (2, 3) as initial studies demonstrated success rates of &gt; 90% on per&#xD;
      protocol analysis (PP) and &gt; 80% on intention to treat (ITT) analysis . However increasing&#xD;
      bacterial resistance, especially to clarithromycin, has been reported and there are concerns&#xD;
      that the efficacy of TT has decreased. Sequential therapy (ST) is an alternative first line&#xD;
      therapy that consists of 5 days of treatment with a PPI and amoxicillin followed by 5-day&#xD;
      treatment with the PPI and clarithromycin and metronidazole. The rationale for this approach&#xD;
      is that amoxicillin may weaken the bacterial cell wall in the initial phase of treatment, and&#xD;
      prevent the development of drug efflux channels that inhibit clarithromycin from binding to&#xD;
      ribosomes and thus help to improve the efficacy of clarithromycin in the second phase of&#xD;
      treatment. A recent meta-analysis based on mainly European studies showed that the success&#xD;
      rate of ST compared to TT was 92.8 - 96% vs. 76.2 - 78.8% (4). Concomitant therapy (CT) is&#xD;
      another alternative first line treatment that consists of 10 days of PPI, amoxicillin,&#xD;
      clarithromycin and metronidazole. The rationale for using CT as a first line treatment option&#xD;
      is to address the possibility of clarithromycin resistance which is increasingly encountered&#xD;
      in clinical practice (5). Currently there are no randomized controlled studies that compared&#xD;
      TT with ST in Singapore, although both regimens are being used in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that ST is superior to TT as first line treatment for H. pylori infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 10-day triple therapy (TT) [twice daily proton pump inhibitors (PPI), amoxicillin 1 g and&#xD;
      clarithromycin 500mg] versus 10-day sequential therapy (ST) [5 day PPI and amoxicillin 1g&#xD;
      twice daily followed by 5 days PPI, clarithromycin 500mg and metronidazole 400mg twice daily]&#xD;
      versus 10-day concomitant therapy (CT) [twice daily PPI, amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 500mg&#xD;
      and metronidazole 400mg] as first line treatment for H. pylori infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective randomized controlled study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment H. pylori infected patients will be randomized to be treated using either 10 day TT&#xD;
      (PPI, amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 500mg twice daily) or 10-day ST (PPI and amoxicillin 1 g&#xD;
      twice daily x 5 days followed by PPI, clarithromycin 500mg, metronidazole 400mg twice daily x&#xD;
      5days) or 10-day CT (PPI, amoxicillin 1g, clarithromycin 500mg, metronidazole 400mg twice&#xD;
      daily). The success of treatment will be defined as either a negative carbon urea breath test&#xD;
      (CUBT) or negative histology performed more than 4 weeks after completion of treatment. CUBT&#xD;
      or histology will be performed based on the clinical indication as determined by the&#xD;
      attending physician. All patients should be off PPI for at least 2 weeks, or histamine 2&#xD;
      receptor antagonists for at least 1 week, prior to assessment of the success of treatment, as&#xD;
      per standard practice. The compliance to treatment in terms of percentage of drugs taken will&#xD;
      be assessed during clinic review.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Antibiotic susceptibility testing For patients with H. pylori infection diagnosed during&#xD;
      endoscopy from a positive rapid urease test kit, the material from the test kit will be used&#xD;
      sent for antibiotic susceptibility testing whenever it is technically feasible. This may be&#xD;
      of value in guiding the choice of antibiotics for second line salvage treatment should first&#xD;
      line treatment fails.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A treatment success rate of 80% is regarded as the minimum acceptable threshold for empiric&#xD;
      first line therapy. Data from several countries have suggested that the success rate of&#xD;
      triple therapy may be lower than 80%, whereas that for concomitant therapy may exceed 90%.&#xD;
      Thus for the study to have 80% power with significance level of 5%, the minimum number of&#xD;
      patients to be recruited into each arm will be 138 if the highest success rate is 91% and&#xD;
      lowest success rate is 79%. Randomization will be performed in blocks of 15. Categorical data&#xD;
      will be analysed using Chi-square or Fisher exact test, while continuous data will be&#xD;
      analysed using student's t test. A p value of &lt; 0.05 will be taken as statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
