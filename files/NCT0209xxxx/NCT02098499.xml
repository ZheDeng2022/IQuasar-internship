    <textblock>
      Haloperidol is known to be a safe alternative medication to control difficult pain, and has&#xD;
      been shown effective when compared to placebo for controlling headaches. Investigators&#xD;
      hypothesized that the combination of haloperidol and diphenhydramine would be a useful&#xD;
      medication choice for migraine headache patients in the emergency department in comparison to&#xD;
      a common migraine treatment regimen of metoclopramide and diphenhydramine.&#xD;

      Investigators conducted a prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in migraine&#xD;
      patients who presented to an academic emergency department between June 2013 and November&#xD;
      2013. Research data was derived from an IRB approved protocol. All subjects met IHS migraine&#xD;
      criteria and received a one liter bolus of normal saline plus 25 milligrams (mg) of&#xD;
      diphenhydramine. Subjects were subsequently randomized to receive 10 mg metoclopramide or 5&#xD;
      mg haloperidol IV. Pain was self-reported at onset and at 20 minute intervals using a 100mm&#xD;
      visual analog scale (VAS). Adequate pain control was considered to be patient satisfaction&#xD;
      with symptomatic relief. If adequate pain relief was not obtained after 80 minutes, rescue&#xD;
      medication was given at the treating physician's discretion. Adverse reactions were recorded&#xD;
      and electrocardiograms (ECGs) were obtained before and after study medication administration.&#xD;
      Follow up phone surveys were performed 72 hours after discharge to assess headache&#xD;
      recurrence, adverse effects, and patient satisfaction.&#xD;
