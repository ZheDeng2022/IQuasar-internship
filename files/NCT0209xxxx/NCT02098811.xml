    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate and compare the safety and pre-cursors of efficacy&#xD;
      of a non-invasive 1064nm laser and 940nm diode, for the disruption of subcutaneous adipose&#xD;
      tissue and skin tightening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the biopsies is to assess if the device causes an inflammatory response in the&#xD;
      abdominoplasty tissue that will be excised.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-smoking subjects between ages of 20-55 years of age presenting excess abdominal&#xD;
             tissue (fat and skin), are candidates for an abdominoplasty procedure and are willing&#xD;
             to allow the use of this device on their skin&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects (Group 2 and 3) who will allow the excess skin removed as part of the&#xD;
             abdominoplasty to be sent for laboratory analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Understand and accept the obligation associated with the procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with Fitzpatrick skin types I to VI.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects (Group 2 and 3) who are willing to consent to participate in the study will&#xD;
             be asked to undergo treatment, elasticity and ultrasound measurements, as outlined for&#xD;
             each group and defined in section 6.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must agree to maintain the same diet and exercise regime throughout the study&#xD;
