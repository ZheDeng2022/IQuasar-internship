    <textblock>
      This pilot research trial studies molecular analysis in tissue samples from patients with&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic neuroendocrine tumors. Studying samples of tissue from patients with&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumors in the lab may help doctors identify mutations to classify disease and&#xD;
      plan the best treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To perform gene panel sequencing of patients with neuroendocrine tumors under care at Fox&#xD;
      Chase Cancer Center for the purpose of identifying therapeutic targets and prognostic&#xD;
      markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the feasibility of performing a clinical trial of molecularly matched therapy&#xD;
      in patients with differing subtypes of neuroendocrine tumors (neuroendocrine tumors of the&#xD;
      pancreas [PNETs], non-pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors [NETs], and poorly differentiated&#xD;
      NETs), based upon the proportion of patients with actionable mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the proportion of patients whose therapy is altered based upon the results of&#xD;
      molecular testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the percent of patients for which a local protocol offers a potential&#xD;
      therapeutic option.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To evaluate the number of patients who are treated based on therapy guided by molecular&#xD;
      profiling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the outcomes of patients treated with early therapy based on gene profiling&#xD;
      with the outcomes of those treated via National Cancer National Comprehensive Cancer Network&#xD;
      (NCCN) guideline recommended therapies (systemic therapy, liver directed therapy, hepatic&#xD;
      resection) or expectant observation via measurement of progression free survival (PFS), via&#xD;
      radiographic response rates, and via biochemical response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the prognostic power of commonly (&gt;= 10%) detected mutations. III. To&#xD;
      evaluate the impact of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway alterations (mutations of&#xD;
      phosphatase and tensin homolog gene [PTEN], phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate 3-kinase,&#xD;
      catalytic subunit alpha [PIK3CA]) on efficacy of mTOR targeted therapeutics, as assessed by&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate the impact of o-6-methylguanine-deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methyltransferase&#xD;
      (MGMT) status on the efficacy of an alkylating based chemotherapy regimen (Temodar,&#xD;
      dacarbazine, streptozocin), as assessed by progression free survival (PFS) and response rate&#xD;
      (RR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the impact of thymidine phosphorylase (TP) status on the efficacy of a&#xD;
      fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy regimen (capecitabine, 5-fluorouracil), as assessed by&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To evaluate the impact of excision repair cross-complementing 1 (ERCC-1) status on the&#xD;
      efficacy of a platinum-based chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin, cisplatin, oxaliplatin), as&#xD;
      assessed by progression free survival (PFS) and response rate (RR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously collected tissue samples are analyzed via mutational sequencing and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed for up every 3-6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
