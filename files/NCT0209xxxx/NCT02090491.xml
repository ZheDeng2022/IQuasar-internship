  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a collection of complex neurodevelopmental disorders&#xD;
      characterized by qualitative impairments in socialization, communication, and circumscribed&#xD;
      interests, including stereotypical behavior patterns and behavioral rigidity to changes in&#xD;
      routines (American Psychiatric Association, 1994). ASD is the fastest growing pervasive&#xD;
      developmental disorder of childhood, currently estimated to affect 1 in 88 school age&#xD;
      children (Baio, 2012). ASD typically manifests in infancy and persist throughout the&#xD;
      lifespan. There is no known cause or cure for ASD, yet structured behavioral interventions&#xD;
      and medications can enhance developmental outcomes. ASD has a profound impact on families and&#xD;
      often result in enormous emotional and financial costs. Recent estimates suggest that&#xD;
      societal costs in the US to care for all individuals diagnosed each year over their lifetime&#xD;
      approaches $35 billion (Ganz, 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Janssen Research &amp; Development is building a comprehensive digital platform (MENTIS) to&#xD;
      optimize and enhance development of novel medicines and track outcomes in individuals with&#xD;
      ASD. The MENTIS platform contains several core components, including: (1) An electronic&#xD;
      personal healthcare record, designed specifically for individuals with ASD and their&#xD;
      caregivers (parents, teachers, healthcare providers); (2) Integrated physiological and&#xD;
      physical activity biosensors designed to objectively assess outcomes important in ASD, and;&#xD;
      (3) A de-identified research data warehouse with analytic tools to better measure outcomes,&#xD;
      assist with sub-population identification, and identify algorithms for diagnosis and&#xD;
      treatment response detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MENTIS platform is currently being designed, developed, and prepared for testing. During&#xD;
      this process it is highly desirable to conduct feasibility and usability research with a&#xD;
      sample of the target population to identify important system components and features,&#xD;
      optimize design, and reduce redundancy in software development and research time. The rapid&#xD;
      pilot study described herein is proposed to gather incipient feedback on select MENTIS system&#xD;
      components and features from stakeholders who support individuals with ASD in a clinical&#xD;
      setting. This pilot research will help evaluate both how well current MENTIS system features&#xD;
      work in an applied setting and inform future directions for MENTIS platform development.&#xD;

        Group 1: Six (6) students from the Discovery School and their respective support staff.&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria include a diagnosis of ASD and enrollment in the Discovery School due to&#xD;
        frequently observed challenging behaviors. Reporters will include: 2 teachers, HCP and&#xD;
        parent/guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Group 2: Fourteen (14) students receiving services from Center for Discovery (but outside&#xD;
        the Discovery School), their respective support staff, and, for those who live at home,&#xD;
        their parents. Inclusion criteria includes a diagnosis of ASD, seven (7) students who&#xD;
        reside in a CfD provided campus home, and seven (7) students who reside in the local&#xD;
        community with their parents. Reporters will include: 2 teachers, HCP, residential staff&#xD;
        and parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Stakeholders: Healthcare professionals, classroom teachers, residential staff, and parents&#xD;
        who support students with ASD in Groups 1 and 2 above.&#xD;
