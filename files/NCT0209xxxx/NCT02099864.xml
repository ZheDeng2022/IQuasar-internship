    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies genetic and molecular mechanisms in assessing response in&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer receiving enzalutamide therapy. Androgens can cause the growth&#xD;
      of prostate cancer cells. Antihormone therapy, such as enzalutamide, may lessen the amount of&#xD;
      androgens made by the body. Studying samples of tissue and blood in the laboratory from&#xD;
      patients with prostate cancer may help doctors better understand castration-resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer. It may also help doctors make improvements in prostate cancer treatment.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the correlations between baseline molecular features and pathways and&#xD;
      prostate-specific antigen (PSA) change (&lt;/&gt;= 50% decline) at 12 weeks versus (vs.) baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To measure PSA change at 12 weeks and at each study visit vs. baseline after enzalutamide&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure objective response after enzalutamide treatment. III. To assess the&#xD;
      correlations between the baseline molecular features and pathways and progression-free&#xD;
      survival, disease-specific survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess the correlations between the baseline molecular features and pathways and time&#xD;
      to PSA progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To identify molecular features and cellular pathways present in tumors from men with&#xD;
      metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) that are progressing despite&#xD;
      enzalutamide treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore correlation between baseline molecular features and pathways and changes in&#xD;
      circulating tumor cells (CTCs) counts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To explore correlation between baseline molecular features and pathways and objective&#xD;
      response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. To assess the correlations between the baseline molecular features and pathways and&#xD;
      degree of PSA decline at 12 weeks and maximal PSA decline observed while on study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. To assess the correlations between the baseline molecular features and time on treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess correlations between cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) (cfDNA) molecular&#xD;
      features from blood and molecular features and pathways from the biopsy samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess correlations between cfDNA molecular features and endpoints in the primary and&#xD;
      secondary objectives listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess correlations between cell-free DNA and tumor molecular features and changes in&#xD;
      PSA after discontinuing enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore correlations with baseline molecular features and tissue histology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore correlations with baseline tissue histology and PSA change, time to PSA&#xD;
      progression, time on treatment, progression-free survival, and overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive enzalutamide orally (PO) once daily (QD) in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients undergo a tumor biopsy of a metastatic site at&#xD;
      study entry (prior to initiation of enzalutamide) and after the time of progression. Patients&#xD;
      may continue treatment beyond progression at the investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 2-3 or 6 weeks and then&#xD;
      every 12 weeks thereafter.&#xD;

    <measure>Androgen Receptor (AR) Activity Level</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Median Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) AR activity levels of responders and non-responders. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is used to interpret gene expression data. GSEA enrichment score (ES) reflects the degree to which a gene set (GS) is overrepresented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes. ES is calculated by walking down the list, increasing a running-sum statistic when a gene is in the GS and decreasing when it's not. Magnitude of increment depends on correlation of the gene with the phenotype. ES is the max deviation from zero encountered in walking the list. Positive ES indicates GS enrichment at the top of the list; negative indicates GS enrichment at the bottom. GSEA calculates NES as actual ES divided by mean (ESs against all permutations of the dataset). Low AR activity has been linked to stemness and lineage plasticity that are recognized as a cause of acquired resistance to AR-targeting therapies.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of Participants With an Objective Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to date of first documented radiographic objective response, assessed up to 1 year</time_frame>
    <description>The percentage of participants with an objective response will be reported with 95% exact confidence interval. Objective radiographic response is evaluated using the new international criteria proposed by the revised Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) guideline (version 1.1). Changes in the largest diameter (unidimensional measurement) of the tumor lesions and the shortest diameter in the case of malignant lymph nodes are used in the RECIST criteria. For each participant, objective response is calculated as 100% times the difference between the sum of measurable target lesions at baseline and the smallest sum of measurable target lesions achieved after the initiation of therapy, divided by the sum of target lesions at baseline.</description>

Simple Logistic regression was planned but due to sample size we used Fisher's Exact test. Percentage of patients in each arm with PTEN copy number alterations and mutations will be reported and odds ratio with two-sided 95% confidence interval will be calculated.</description>

        <description>Median Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) AR activity levels of responders and non-responders. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) is used to interpret gene expression data. GSEA enrichment score (ES) reflects the degree to which a gene set (GS) is overrepresented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of genes. ES is calculated by walking down the list, increasing a running-sum statistic when a gene is in the GS and decreasing when it's not. Magnitude of increment depends on correlation of the gene with the phenotype. ES is the max deviation from zero encountered in walking the list. Positive ES indicates GS enrichment at the top of the list; negative indicates GS enrichment at the bottom. GSEA calculates NES as actual ES divided by mean (ESs against all permutations of the dataset). Low AR activity has been linked to stemness and lineage plasticity that are recognized as a cause of acquired resistance to AR-targeting therapies.</description>
