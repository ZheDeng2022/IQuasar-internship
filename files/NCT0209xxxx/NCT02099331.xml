  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is a common heart rhythm condition that can occur after cardiac surgery&#xD;
      and has been associated with an increase in hospital length of stay, overall hospital costs,&#xD;
      worsening clinical condition and higher rates of death. Newer research indicates that&#xD;
      inflammation is a key contributor to atrial fibrillation in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is a naturally made hormone that is regarded as an extremely effective&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory substance, with a very favorable safety profile. This clinical trial is&#xD;
      being done to test the ability of melatonin to reduce the risk of developing atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation after cardiac surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a research study where patients will be given either oral melatonin at 40 mg or&#xD;
      placebo nightly prior to sleep. The study product will start approximately 2 days prior to&#xD;
      the scheduled surgery date and will continue until the 3rd day after the operation. The&#xD;
      remainder of the clinical care will remain the same.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators project that patients who receive melatonin will have a significant&#xD;
      decrease in the occurrence of atrial fibrillation after surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation is the most common arrhythmia to occur after coronary artery bypass graft&#xD;
      (CABG) surgery. This arrhythmia occurs in approximately 1 in every 3 patients in this setting&#xD;
      and the rate is even higher after valve or combined valve and CABG procedures. The majority&#xD;
      of episodes of atrial fibrillation occur within the first 3 days after cardiac surgery and&#xD;
      for those who have an initial episode of atrial fibrillation, the majority will go on to have&#xD;
      another recurrence within 2 days of the first episode. Postoperative atrial fibrillation has&#xD;
      been associated with an increase in neurological, renal and infectious complications as well&#xD;
      as prolonged hospitalization and a significant increase in overall healthcare costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a considerable amount of emerging data indicating that inflammation and oxidative&#xD;
      stress, by way of reactive oxygen species (ROS), associated with cardiac surgery and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) may play an important role in the in the development of&#xD;
      postoperative atrial fibrillation. Prior animal studies have demonstrated that ROS may lead&#xD;
      to electroanatomical remodeling and increase the vulnerability to atrial fibrillation by&#xD;
      promoting progressive fibrosis and subsequent alteration of the extracellular matrix. A few&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials have demonstrated the beneficial effects of pre-treatment with&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory medications such as statins for the prevention of post-operative atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation. With this in mind, other anti-inflammatory therapies may also be effective in&#xD;
      preventing postoperative atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin (N - acetyl - 5 - methoxytryptamine) is the main product secreted from the pineal&#xD;
      gland and has been shown to be a powerful scavenger of ROS and is regarded as the most potent&#xD;
      endogenous antioxidant. In fact, melatonin is more effective than other antioxidants in&#xD;
      removing free radicals and it has both lipophilic and hydrophilic properties contributing to&#xD;
      its more consistent penetration through cellular membranes. In addition to being a naturally&#xD;
      synthesized hormone, melatonin has been shown to have a very favorable safety profile when&#xD;
      administered in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For these reasons, investigators have designed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      trial where patients who are to undergo cardiac surgery and CPB, will be randomized to&#xD;
      melatonin or placebo and the investigators will determine the incidence of post operative&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation in both groups. Additionally, the investigators will measure ROS from&#xD;
      serum as well as right atrial appendage samples of subjects and assess the effects of&#xD;
      melatonin on ROS levels as compared to placebo.&#xD;
