    <textblock>
      Crohn's disease is a chronic and relapsing inflammatory bowel disease. Many data show that&#xD;
      the intestinal flora is involved in the disease and it has been show that patients with&#xD;
      Crohn's disease exhibit an abnormal fecal flora that might play a role in inflammation. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to determine the effect of the fecal flora transplantation on&#xD;
      Crohn's disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Introduction : Crohn's disease (CD) is an relapsing inflammatory bowel disease relatively&#xD;
      frequent. Its prevalence is about 1 for 700 in France, affecting predominantly young adults.&#xD;
      Its treatment is based on immunosuppressants that might be associated with potentially severe&#xD;
      complications such as infection and cancers. Moreover, these treatments are expensive. The&#xD;
      gut microbiota being involved in the disease pathogenesis, it can be considered as a&#xD;
      potential therapeutic target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CD pathogenesis remains poorly understood but involves an inappropriate immune response&#xD;
      toward an unbalanced gut microbiota (called dysbiosis) in predisposed hosts. The complete&#xD;
      replacement of a dysbiotic microbiota by a &quot;healthy&quot; one is thus an attractive strategy.&#xD;
      Fecal transplantation (FT) has been used with success for a long time in the context of&#xD;
      Clostridium difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis : Fecal transplantation allow the replacement of a dysbiotic microbiota by a &quot;&#xD;
      healthy &quot; one with favorable impact on CD evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint : In CD patient with colonic or ileo-colonic involvement put in remission&#xD;
      with corticosteroids, Evaluate if FT can modify a dysbiotic fecal microbiota to be closer of&#xD;
      the one of a healthy donor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Receiver :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once corticoid-induced remission will be achieved, the patient will be included and&#xD;
      randomised to receive either FT or sham transplantation during a colonoscopy. The patient&#xD;
      will be evaluated at week 2, 6, 10, 14, 18 and 24. At week 6, a colonoscopy will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the Donor :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors will be recruited by poster advertising. When a receiver will be included, 3 donors&#xD;
      will be contacted to attend an inclusion visit including physical examination as well as&#xD;
      blood and stool screening for pathogen. The 3 donors will then come the day of the FT to&#xD;
      donate their stool.&#xD;

    <description>In other words, FT success is reached if the fecal microbiota of the receiver 6 weeks after FT is closer of the fecal microbiota of the donor that of the receiver before FT.&#xD;
Fecal microbiota composition will be assessed by 454 pyrosequencing (16S RNA) and microbiota comparison will be done using Sorensen's index.</description>
