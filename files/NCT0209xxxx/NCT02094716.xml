      To determine and compare the safety and efficacy of permethrin foam 4% and permethrin foam 5%&#xD;
      with that of vehicle in subjects with scabies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      It is anticipated that a majority of subjects will require and receive a single treatment;&#xD;
      however, those subjects not showing improvement at the follow-up visit 2 weeks after initial&#xD;
      treatment will be treated a second time. Those subjects originally assigned to vehicle for&#xD;
      the first treatment will receive a &quot;re-treatment&quot; with one of the active doses.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Subjects Who Received a Single Treatment of the Assigned Test Article That Were Designated as &quot;Treatment Success&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy variable is &quot;treatment success&quot;. In protocol v2.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In protocol v3.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an &quot;eradication of infestation&quot;: a) no burrows, b) a reduction in the Signs/Symptoms, and c) no evidence of a live mite on microscopy.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Disease-related Signs and Symptoms for Those Subjects Provided With Re-treatment at Day 14 Who Show Improvement in Their Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score at Day 28</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Day 14, 28, and 42</time_frame>
    <description>The change in the total score of signs and symptoms related to the condition in each treatment group at Days 14 and 28, as well as at Day 42 for those subjects provided with re-treatment at Day 14 who show improvement in their IGA score at Day 28.&#xD;
Scale details: The overall average presence of the individual signs and symptoms of scabies was evaluated over the entire body. Erythema, papules, pustules, crusting, scaling, excoriations, and pruritus were assessed as follows for each sign and symptom: None=0, Trace=1, Mild=2, Moderate=3, Severe=4. From these assessments, the total score of the Signs and Symptoms (from 0 to 28, higher scores mean a worse outcome) was calculated as the sum of the individual signs and symptoms scores at Baseline and Days 2, 14, 28, and 42 (if applicable).The change from baseline in the total score can range from -28 as the best reduction possible (better outcome) to +28 as the worst increase possible (worse outcome) in signs and symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Re-treated Subjects Designated as &quot;Treatment Success&quot;</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>Each subject was designated as &quot;re-treatment success&quot; at Day 42 based upon the criteria in the protocol to which he/she was enrolled. In protocol v2.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In protocol v3.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an &quot;eradication of infestation&quot;: a) no burrows, b) a reduction in the Signs/Symptoms, and c) no evidence of a live mite on microscopy.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of Subjects Designated as &quot;Treatment Success&quot; Following One Treatment With an Active Dose</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 28 and Day 42</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects designated as &quot;treatment success&quot; following one treatment versus two treatments.&#xD;
In protocol v2.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In protocol v3.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an &quot;eradication of infestation&quot;: a) no burrows, b) a reduction in the Signs/Symptoms, and c) no evidence of a live mite on microscopy.&#xD;
Subjects originally assigned to vehicle treatment and re-treated on Day 14 with an active dose will be included with the single treatment group for this analysis.&#xD;
Subjects who did not improve at Day 14 were counted as failures at Day 28. Subjects who improved at Day 14 and received a second treatment in error were counted as failures at Day 28.</description>

        <description>The primary efficacy variable is &quot;treatment success&quot;. In protocol v2.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In protocol v3.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an &quot;eradication of infestation&quot;: a) no burrows, b) a reduction in the Signs/Symptoms, and c) no evidence of a live mite on microscopy.</description>

        <title>Change in Disease-related Signs and Symptoms for Those Subjects Provided With Re-treatment at Day 14 Who Show Improvement in Their Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) Score at Day 28</title>
        <description>The change in the total score of signs and symptoms related to the condition in each treatment group at Days 14 and 28, as well as at Day 42 for those subjects provided with re-treatment at Day 14 who show improvement in their IGA score at Day 28.&#xD;
Scale details: The overall average presence of the individual signs and symptoms of scabies was evaluated over the entire body. Erythema, papules, pustules, crusting, scaling, excoriations, and pruritus were assessed as follows for each sign and symptom: None=0, Trace=1, Mild=2, Moderate=3, Severe=4. From these assessments, the total score of the Signs and Symptoms (from 0 to 28, higher scores mean a worse outcome) was calculated as the sum of the individual signs and symptoms scores at Baseline and Days 2, 14, 28, and 42 (if applicable).The change from baseline in the total score can range from -28 as the best reduction possible (better outcome) to +28 as the worst increase possible (worse outcome) in signs and symptoms.</description>

          <title>Number of Subjects Designated as &quot;Treatment Success&quot; Following One Treatment With an Active Dose</title>
          <description>The proportion of subjects designated as &quot;treatment success&quot; following one treatment versus two treatments.&#xD;
In protocol v2.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an Investigator's Global Assessment (IGA) score of 0 (clear) or 1 (almost clear). In protocol v3.0, &quot;treatment success&quot; was defined as an &quot;eradication of infestation&quot;: a) no burrows, b) a reduction in the Signs/Symptoms, and c) no evidence of a live mite on microscopy.&#xD;
Subjects originally assigned to vehicle treatment and re-treated on Day 14 with an active dose will be included with the single treatment group for this analysis.&#xD;
Subjects who did not improve at Day 14 were counted as failures at Day 28. Subjects who improved at Day 14 and received a second treatment in error were counted as failures at Day 28.</description>
