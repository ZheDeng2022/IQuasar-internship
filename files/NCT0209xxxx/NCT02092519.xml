      Background: EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUSFNA) is a well established technique for&#xD;
      tissue acquisition and diagnosis with excellent safety profile. The overall diagnostic yield&#xD;
      of EUSFNA exceeds 80%, with higher rates in EUSFNA of lymph nodes, where rates of &gt;90% may be&#xD;
      expected, as compared to pancreatic masses, where lower diagnostic rates were reported. To&#xD;
      maximize the diagnostic yield, at least 3 needle passes are required for lymph nodes and at&#xD;
      least 4 passes for pancreatic masses. Olympus has recently made commercially available a new&#xD;
      22 gauge FNA needle (EZ Shot 2 with side port) with a side port at the needle tip. The&#xD;
      theoretical basis for introduction of the side port is to increase the diagnostic yield.&#xD;
      Preliminary unpublished retrospective data suggested the yield might be raised. However,&#xD;
      there are no prospective multicenter randomized controlled studies to ascertain the validity&#xD;
      of the assumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To determine whether there is a difference in diagnostic yield between EZ-Shot 2 and&#xD;
      EZ-Shot 2 with side port in patients with pancreatic masses for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients with pancreatic masses referred for EUSFNA will be recruited prospectively&#xD;
      and randomized to either EZ-Shot 2 or EZ Shot 2 with sideport for the first puncture, and&#xD;
      then the alternative needle will be used for repeated punctured. The cytological and&#xD;
      diagnostic yield at first pass for both needles will be compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical significance: This will determine whether the new needle design can further improve&#xD;
      the diagnostic yield of EUSFNA of pancreatic masses.&#xD;

      Background Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS) and EUS-guided fine needle aspiration (EUSFNA) are&#xD;
      well established techniques in clinical practice. In routine gastrointestinal endoscopy such&#xD;
      as gastroscopy, only the mucosal layer of the digestive tract is visualized. In the case of&#xD;
      EUS, an ultrasonic transducer located at the tip of the echoendoscope allows the endoscopist&#xD;
      to visualize the wall of gastrointestinal tract as a series of definable layers corresponding&#xD;
      to histology, rather than as a single entity, and also enables detailed images of areas&#xD;
      outside of the digestive tract, such as intra-abdominal lymph nodes, and solid organs such as&#xD;
      liver, pancreas to be seen. EUS has a significant clinical impact because it allows&#xD;
      assessment of submucosal GI lesions, loco-regional staging of gastrointestinal malignancy,&#xD;
      tissue diagnosis by EUSFNA and staging of pancreaticobiliary lesions, non-small-cell lung&#xD;
      carcinoma, and mediastinal disease. EUSFNA is a minimally invasive technique of tissue&#xD;
      acquisition under EUS guidance. A FNA needle is inserted through the accessory channel of a&#xD;
      curvilinear echoendoscope. Both the target lesion and the needle tip are visualized under&#xD;
      real time ultrasound guidance, and any potential intervening vessels can be excluded by&#xD;
      turning on the Doppler mode prior to needle puncture. The lesion is then punctured under&#xD;
      real-time ultrasonic guidance and material aspirated by the needle for cytological&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In prospective trials, EUSFNA has been clearly established to be an important diagnostic&#xD;
      tool, with excellent safety profile. The overall diagnostic yield of EUSFNA should exceed&#xD;
      80%, with higher rates in EUSFNA of lymph nodes, where rates of &gt;90% may be expected, as&#xD;
      compared to pancreatic masses, where lower diagnostic rates were reported. The somewhat lower&#xD;
      rates for solid pancreatic lesions compared to lymph nodes could be due to the underlying&#xD;
      desmoplastic changes associated with pancreatic malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EUSFNA may be performed with rapid on site cytopathological assessment (ROSE) of the&#xD;
      aspirated material to guide the number of needle passes being performed. In most practices,&#xD;
      rapid on site cytopathological assessment is not feasible and it has been recommended that in&#xD;
      such situation, in order to maximize the diagnostic yield, at least 3 needle passes should be&#xD;
      performed for lymph nodes and at least 4 passes should be performed for pancreatic masses.&#xD;
      Even without onsite cytopathological assessment, excellent results with greater than 90%&#xD;
      diagnostic yield have been reported by expert centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Needles for EUSFNA are available from four manufacturers, namely Cook Endoscopy, Boston&#xD;
      Scientific, Olympus Corporation and Mediglobe. The available needle diameters are 25, 22 and&#xD;
      19 gauge. These needles have a sharp tip for puncturing and a hollow core for aspiration&#xD;
      after the puncture. The hollow needle core is covered by a stylet which is withdrawn after&#xD;
      the puncture to facilitate aspiration. Aspiration is usually facilitated by application of&#xD;
      suction using a syringe which is attached to the entry port of the hollow core of the needle,&#xD;
      after the stylet has been withdrawn, although it must also be acknowledged that there are&#xD;
      endoscopists who prefer to apply no suction in order to reduce the possibility of bloody&#xD;
      aspirates. Olympus has recently made commercially available a new 22 gauge FNA needle with a&#xD;
      side port at the needle tip. The theoretical basis for introduction of the side port is to&#xD;
      facilitate the process of fine needle aspiration, and to increase the diagnostic yield. There&#xD;
      have been preliminary unpublished retrospective data that suggested the yield might be&#xD;
      raised. However, there are no prospective multicenter randomized controlled studies to&#xD;
      ascertain the validity of the assumption. Currently two needles with similar designs, apart&#xD;
      from absence and presence of side port, are available from Olympus Corporation. These are the&#xD;
      EZ-Shot 2 (model: NA-220H-8022) and EZ-Shot 2 with side port (NA-230H-8022)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim The aim of this prospective randomized study is to determine whether there is a&#xD;
      difference in diagnostic yield between EZ-Shot 2 (model: NA-220H-8022) and EZ-Shot 2 with&#xD;
      side port (NA-230H-8022) in patients with pancreatic masses for evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Setting and trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Setting: International; multicenter. Trial design: Randomized prospective comparative&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria: 1) all patients referred for EUSFNA of pancreatic masses; 2)&#xD;
           informed consent is obtained for performance of EUSFNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria: 1) presence of active gastrointestinal bleeding; 2) presence of&#xD;
           coagulopathy as defined by platelet count &lt;50000/mm3 or/ and international normalized&#xD;
           ratio &gt;1.5; 3) the current use of thienopyridines (e. g. clopidogrel) in patents&#xD;
           requiring anti-platelet therapy; 4) absence of procedural informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The protocol will be approved by local Institutional Review Board. Patients will be&#xD;
           giving informed consent for the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization: Randomization of the needle used for initial puncture will be carried in&#xD;
           blocks of 5 with equal assignment to the EZ-Shot 2 (model: NA-220H-8022) and EZ-Shot 2&#xD;
           with side port (NA-230H-8022) needles. Once the first 2 punctures have been performed,&#xD;
           the alternative needle will be used to obtain the subsequent needle passes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           EUS and EUSFNA technique: EUS and EUS will be performed using a curvilinear&#xD;
           echoendoscope according to standard techniques9 by a credentialed endoscopist or under&#xD;
           the direct supervision of a credentialed endoscopist in the case of procedures performed&#xD;
           by trainees. The patient will either undergo the procedure without sedation, under&#xD;
           sedation or under general anesthesia as clinically indicated. As per standard technique,&#xD;
           the lesion is visualized using EUS, and then the 22gauge EUSFNA needle (depending on&#xD;
           randomization either NA-220H-8022 or NA-230H-8022) is introduced into the accessory&#xD;
           channel of the echoendoscope and the lesion is punctured under real time ultrasonic&#xD;
           guidance. After withdrawal of the stylet and application of suction by attachment of a&#xD;
           syringe with negative pressure, the needle is moved to and fro within the lesion for&#xD;
           approximately 30 seconds, and then the needle is withdrawn and the material aspirated is&#xD;
           expressed onto glass slides by reinsertion of the stylet and direct smears are made&#xD;
           either by the endoscopist or cytotechnician. This process is repeated once using the&#xD;
           first needle. The alternative needle is then used to make 2 further punctures..&#xD;
&#xD;
           Preparation of aspirated material and definition of cellular adequacy and diagnostic&#xD;
           yield10,11: The material aspirated is expressed onto glass slides by reinsertion of the&#xD;
           stylet and direct smears are made either by the endoscopist or cytotechnician. After&#xD;
           expressing the cellular material onto glass slides, half the slides will be air-dried&#xD;
           and half will be alcohol fixed (95% ethanol) for subsequent cytological assessment. When&#xD;
           no further material can be expressed, the residual contents of the needle are flushed&#xD;
           with 5 to 10 mL of sterile saline solution into a balanced salt solution. After flushing&#xD;
           the needle, the outside of the needle and the stylet are vigorously wiped with saline&#xD;
           solution-soaked sterile gauze to reduce cross contamination between passes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An adequate specimen is defined as the clear presence of target organ cells. In the case&#xD;
           for the pancreas there must be at least 4 clusters of pancreatic acinar cells with or&#xD;
           without the presence of malignant-appearing cells. A cytopathologist blinded to the&#xD;
           needle used for FNA, will characterized each individual needle pass for assessment of&#xD;
           adequate cellularity (0 [inadequate] or 1 [adequate]) and a diagnosis of malignancy&#xD;
           (insufficient, normal, &quot;suspicious,&quot; malignant). . The diagnosis arrived at for each&#xD;
           needle pass will be compared with the final diagnosis which will be based on composite&#xD;
           of cytology, histology and clinical course. The EUSFNA findings will be classified as 1)&#xD;
           inadequate for diagnosis; 2) true positive for malignancy; 3) true negative for&#xD;
           malignancy; 4) false positive for malignancy; 5) false negative for malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Statistics Sample size: As this is an exploratory study, a sequential trial design will&#xD;
           be used to determine the ideal sample size. For the initial assessment, a total of 30&#xD;
           pancreatic masses will be targeted. Dependent on the outcome and trend, this may be&#xD;
           further increased to 100 cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Primary 1. Compare 1st pass cellular adequacy rate each needle: 2. Compare the overall&#xD;
           cellular adequacy rate each needle 3. Compare the overall diagnostic accuracy rate&#xD;
           between both needles 4. Compare 1st pass diagnostic accuracy adequacy rate of each&#xD;
           needle&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Timetable of work Complete study within 6 months, but may extend to 24 months&#xD;
