    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of Selinexor when given together&#xD;
      with decitabine in treating patients with acute myeloid leukemia that has returned after&#xD;
      treatment (relapsed) or does not respond to treatment (refractory). Drugs used in&#xD;
      chemotherapy, such as decitabine and Selinexor, work in different ways to stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the safety and tolerability of Selinexor (KPT-330) in combination with&#xD;
      decitabine in patients with acute myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To define the specific toxicities, maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and the dose limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the Recommended Phase 2 Dose (RP2D) of this combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the overall response rate (ORR). II. To determine the rate and duration of&#xD;
      complete remission (CR) +/- hematological recovery of KPT-330 plus decitabine in AML.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To conduct pharmacodynamic studies by measuring the effect of this chemotherapy&#xD;
      combination on the kinome, micronome and epigenome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of selinexor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION: Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on days 1-10 and&#xD;
      Selinexor orally (PO) on days 11, 13, 18, 20, 25 and 27. Treatment repeats every 31 days for&#xD;
      up to 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE: Patients receive decitabine IV over 1 hour on days 1-5 and Selinexor PO on days&#xD;
      6, 8, 13, 15, 20 and 22. Courses repeat every 31 days in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up periodically.&#xD;
