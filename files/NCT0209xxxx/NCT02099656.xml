  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Phase II, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multicenter study will evaluate&#xD;
      the effects of lebrikizumab on airway eosinophilic inflammation in participants with&#xD;
      uncontrolled asthma who are using inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) treatment and a second&#xD;
      controller medication. Enrolled participants will undergo a 3-week screening period during&#xD;
      which assessments, including a bronchoscopy procedure, will be made. Participants will&#xD;
      subsequently be randomized to receive lebrikizumab or placebo by subcutaneous (SC) injection&#xD;
      on Day 1, Day 8, Week 4, and Week 8. Participants will continue their standard of care&#xD;
      therapy throughout the study. End of treatment assessments will be taken at Week 12. Total&#xD;
      study period, including screening and follow-up, is expected to last 23 weeks.&#xD;
