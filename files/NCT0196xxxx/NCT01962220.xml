      Linking HIV-infected pregnant women into prevention of mother to child transmission (PMTCT)&#xD;
      services and keeping them in care is important in ensuring that both mother and infant beneÔ¨Åt&#xD;
      from interventions that improve maternal health and decrease HIV transmission to infants. We&#xD;
      propose an evaluation of strategies to link newly diagnosed HIV-infected women to care and&#xD;
      keep them in care during pregnancy and after delivery in our study called MIR4HEALTH. The&#xD;
      study will be conducted in Nyanza Province, Kenya. All participants will provide informed&#xD;
      consent and will be randomized to receive the intervention, including individualized patient&#xD;
      education, adherence support and phone call/Short Message Service (SMS) reminders for clinic&#xD;
      appointments, or the standard of care (no additional intervention services).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mother Infant Retention for Health (MIR4HEALTH) is an innovative implementation science study&#xD;
      focused on testing an effective multicomponent strategy to improve linkage and retention of&#xD;
      newly identified HIV-infected pregnant women accessing maternal child health (MCH) services&#xD;
      in Nyanza Province, Kenya. MIR4HEALTH is distinguished by several innovations including the&#xD;
      recognition that newly identified HIV-infected pregnant woman are especially vulnerable to&#xD;
      poor retention within PMTCT services and that both mother and child must be retained in care&#xD;
      to ensure optimal health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomized trial to compare the effectiveness of a novel strategy using Active&#xD;
      Patient Follow-Up (APFU) to the current standard of care (SOC) routinely provided for the&#xD;
      retention of women and their exposed infants postpartum. The proposed APFU includes a package&#xD;
      of evidence-based interventions including health education, provision of phone and short&#xD;
      message service (SMS) appointment reminders, active tracking of patients for linkage and&#xD;
      retention, and individualized retention and adherence support. Patients enrolled in the APFU&#xD;
      intervention arm will complete three antenatal study visits after enrollment as well as two&#xD;
      postnatal study visits with their infants at 6 weeks and 6 months postpartum. Laboratory&#xD;
      blood specimens will be collected from mothers and infants at two separate visits to assess&#xD;
      viral load and and drug levels. Additionally, all staff will be offered a chance to&#xD;
      participate in an interview assessing the feasibility and acceptability of APFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be recruited from various clinics in the Nyanza Province in Kenya.&#xD;
      This study will enroll pregnant women who test positive for HIV during their first antenatal&#xD;
      visit and have no prior HIV diagnosis. Upon live birth, the infants of participating women&#xD;
      will also be included in the study. The study will enroll 214 newly-infected pregnant women,&#xD;
      with 107 participants in the APFU arm (intervention) and 107 participants in the SOC arm.&#xD;
      Infants born to women enrolled in the study will also be included so there will be a total of&#xD;
      214 mother-infant pairs, totaling 428 participants.&#xD;
