      This study is a phase 2, open-label extension study of 12 mg Proellex for 2 treatment cycles,&#xD;
      each with a 16 week active dosing period. Endometriosis pain, dysmenorrhea, non-menstrual&#xD;
      pelvic pain and dyspareunia (BBSS) as well as use of pain medications, and vaginal bleeding&#xD;
      intensity will be recorded using an electronic diary and Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain&#xD;
      assessment will be utilized. All subjects will have completed an Off-Drug Interval (ODI)&#xD;
      prior to starting treatment. Visit 1 will be scheduled within a week before the next expected&#xD;
      menses (+/- 2 days), following the off-drug interval. Subjects will receive 2 cycles of&#xD;
      treatment separated by an off-drug interval (ODI), after which they will be followed until&#xD;
      menses has returned. During the follow-up period subjects will continue to record study&#xD;
      information in the electronic diary. The final follow-up visit will be scheduled after blood&#xD;
      flow has stopped.&#xD;
