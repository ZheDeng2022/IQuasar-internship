    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating an investigational drug called &quot;panobinostat&quot; (LBH589) in&#xD;
      combination with the standard agents lenalidomide, bortezomib, and dexamethasone as a&#xD;
      possible treatment for multiple myeloma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this research study, the participant will be given a study drug-dosing diary for each&#xD;
      treatment cycle. Each treatment cycle lasts 21 days (3 weeks) . The diary will also include&#xD;
      special instructions for taking the study drug(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator are looking for the highest dose of the study drug that can be administered&#xD;
      safely without severe or unmanageable side effects in participants that have multiple&#xD;
      myeloma, not everyone who participates in this research study will receive the same dose of&#xD;
      the study drug. The dose each participant will get will depend on the number of participants&#xD;
      who have been enrolled in the study before each participant and how well they have tolerated&#xD;
      their doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle will be 21 days long. The participant will have to come to the clinic on&#xD;
      days 1, 4, 5, 8, 10 and 11 in Cycle 1 and on days 1, 4, 8 and 11 in Cycles 2 and beyond. Days&#xD;
      1 and 5 of Cycle 1 will take about 8 hours. Every other visit should take about 1-4 hours,&#xD;
      however there is always the possibility that it could take longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Panobinostat is a capsule that the participant will take three times a week for the&#xD;
           first two the weeks of each cycle. Then participant will have one week off study&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bortezomib will be administered in clinic as a subcutaneous injection twice a week&#xD;
           during the first two weeks of each 21 day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lenalidomide will be taken orally once daily on days 1-14 of each cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dexamethasone will be taken orally on the days of and after bortezomib administration&#xD;
           during Cycles 1-8, and on days 1, 8 and 15 for Cycles 9 and beyond.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Follow-up: The investigators would like to monitor the participant's medical&#xD;
      condition even after the participants are no longer participating in the study. The&#xD;
      investigators would like to do this by calling the participants on the telephone once every 6&#xD;
      months to see how the participant is doing. Keeping in touch with the participant and&#xD;
      checking on their condition helps the investigator look at the long-term effects of the&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;
