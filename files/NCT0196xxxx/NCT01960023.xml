  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The FC-7 study is designed as an open label, single arm, Phase I/II dose-escalation study&#xD;
      evaluating the combination of neratinib and cetuximab in patients with metastatic colorectal&#xD;
      cancer primary tumor that is &quot;quadruple wild-type &quot; (wild-type KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA). The&#xD;
      primary aim in the Phase I portion of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of the two-drug combination. The primary aim of the Phase II part is to determine the overall&#xD;
      objective response rate (complete and partial responses) by Response Evaluation Criteria in&#xD;
      Solid Tumors (RECIST 1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive concurrent therapy with cetuximab (400 mg/m2 IV loading dose followed&#xD;
      by 250 mg/m2 IV weekly), and neratinib.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The neratinib dose-escalation using a 3+3 design will include 4 dose levels (120 mg, 160 mg,&#xD;
      200 mg, and 240 mg) as a daily oral dose. Up to 12 patients will be treated at the maximum&#xD;
      tolerated dose (MTD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neratinib dose-escalation for the study will proceed on the basis of dose-limiting&#xD;
      toxicity (DLT) during cycle 1. DLT will be defined as the occurrence of 1 or more of the&#xD;
      following events during cycle 1: any grade diarrhea that is associated with fever or&#xD;
      dehydration requiring IV fluids; grade 3 diarrhea lasting more than 2 days on optimal medical&#xD;
      therapy; grade 4 diarrhea of any duration; grade 3 or 4 neutropenia associated with fever;&#xD;
      grade 4 neutropenia lasting more than 7 days; grade 4 thrombocytopenia; grade 3 or 4&#xD;
      non-hematological toxicity (excluding grade 3 rash or allergic reaction/hypersensitivity); or&#xD;
      any toxicity-related delay of more than 2 weeks to initiate cycle 2. Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled at the next dose level when all evaluable patients at the same dose level have&#xD;
      completed the first treatment cycle. Enrolled patients will remain on the assigned dose level&#xD;
      treatment until toxicity or disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II part of this study will proceed with a two-stage design with a maximum of 46&#xD;
      patients. Between 6 and 12 patients at the Phase I MTD level will be included in the Phase&#xD;
      II, stage-one analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Toxicity will be graded according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology&#xD;
      Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Submission of tumor and blood samples for FC-7 correlative science studies will be a study&#xD;
      requirement for all patients. A core biopsy procedure to procure fresh tumor samples from an&#xD;
      accessible site of metastasis will be performed before study dose level assignment (after the&#xD;
      patient has signed the consent form and has been screened for eligibility).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional biopsy samples of metastatic disease will be procured from consenting patients after&#xD;
      Cycle 1 of treatment and at the time of disease progression.&#xD;
