    <textblock>
      Currently, there is no direct, reliable, bed-side, and non-invasive method for assessing&#xD;
      changes in brain activity associated with concussion. Event Related Potentials (ERPs), which&#xD;
      are temporal reflections of the neural mass electrical activity of cells in specific regions&#xD;
      of the brain that occur in response to stimuli, may offer such a method, as they provide both&#xD;
      a noninvasive and portable measure of brain function. The ERPs provide excellent temporal&#xD;
      information, but spatial resolution for ERPs has traditionally been limited. However, by&#xD;
      using high-density electroencephalograph (EEG) recording spatial resolution for ERPs is&#xD;
      improved significantly. The paradigm for the current study will combine neurophysiological&#xD;
      knowledge with mathematical signal processing and pattern recognition methods (BNA™) to&#xD;
      temporally and spatially map brain function, connectivity and synchronization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will provide additional evidence for the utility and contribution of the&#xD;
      BNA™ test (reflecting temporal and spatial changes in brain activity as well as brain&#xD;
      functional connectivity associated with concussion) in concussion management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The BNA test is basically divided to 3 phases - first EEG data is collected from subjects&#xD;
      using an EEG system while the subject is performing a cognitive task in front of a computer.&#xD;
      The EEG data is then analyzed using the advanced BNA™ technology. Finally, a report of the&#xD;
      BNA™ test is generated.&#xD;

      A single center study evaluating the effectiveness of BNA technology as an objective tool for&#xD;
      sport related concussion management in youth athletes' populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 150 athletes from Minnesota Youth Hockey Programs. Subjects enrolled&#xD;
      in this study will undergo a screening and baseline pre season visit and follow up visit/s.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Follow-up testing for concussed athletes - Concussed athletes will complete a series of&#xD;
           post concussion follow up visits. Each will consist of BNA™ test, ImPACT™ test, and exam&#xD;
           by neurologist or neurology nurse practitioner. The first visit will be within 72 hours&#xD;
           of injury and re-evaluations will occur weekly until BNA has normalized AND subject is&#xD;
           asymptomatic. Subject may return to play at that point and subject will have a final&#xD;
           additional BNA™ test one week after the athlete returns to full activity. If participant&#xD;
           is still symptomatic and/or BNA is still abnormal at 6 weeks reevaluations go to every 2&#xD;
           weeks for up to three months or clearing of symptoms AND normal BNA™. If not back to&#xD;
           baseline at three months, monthly reevaluations until study completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Follow up visit for non-concussed athletes - non-concussed athletes will complete a&#xD;
           follow up visit upon completion of the sport season.&#xD;
