  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if XeominÂ® will prove effective for significantly&#xD;
      improving lower extremity spasticity and will be well tolerated by the majority of MS&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Overall Design: Thirty patients with MS, male or female, ages 18-70, either relapsing or&#xD;
      progressive types, are to be evaluated in a prospective treatment trial comparing gait before&#xD;
      and after injections of Xeomin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Population: The patients included are to have functionally significant equinovarus&#xD;
      spasticity in primarily one lower extremity; functionally significant spasticity is defined&#xD;
      as spasticity impairing gait during observation of during a 25 foot walk, causing falls, or&#xD;
      leading to secondary orthopedic complications such as genu recurvatum or pain in the low back&#xD;
      or hip. The patients are to be ambulatory, with stable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Selection: A dose of 200 units to 400 units of Xeomin will be injected by EMG-guided&#xD;
      technique into the appropriate muscles in the effected leg. These muscles may include&#xD;
      gastrocnemius and soleus, tibialis posterior or other muscles as determined by the examiner.&#xD;
      The dose administered will be determined by the blinded injector based on determination of&#xD;
      muscle bulk and the degree of spasticity Blinding: Investigators will be blinded to&#xD;
      medication used throughout study. Site will randomize subjects in a 1:1 fashion by using an&#xD;
      unblinded site delegate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compliance with Laws and Regulations: This study will be conducted in accordance with the&#xD;
      U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulations, the International Conference on&#xD;
      Harmonisation (ICH) E6 Guideline for Good Clinical Practice (GCP), and applicable local,&#xD;
      state, and federal laws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments: After informed consent is obtained and screening measurements are&#xD;
      completed, the patients will return at 4 weeks for injection for primary and secondary&#xD;
      efficacy evaluations. Additional evaluations at 6 and 12 weeks will be made in order to&#xD;
      determine the duration of effect of Xeomin for secondary efficacy evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concomitant therapy includes any prescription or over the counter preparations being taken by&#xD;
      the patient at any time from screening through the last study visit. All concomitant&#xD;
      medications should be reported to the investigator and recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled in the study will be permitted to take all medication with the exception of&#xD;
      the following&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methylprednisolone within 30 days prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Injection of any botulinum toxin within the past 6 months (180days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study patients will be permitted to receive any treatment deemed necessary by the&#xD;
      investigator for the management of disease. However patients requiring commencement of&#xD;
      excluded therapies will be discontinued from the study and the data will not be used for&#xD;
      statistical purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients must sign informed consent form before any screening evaluations or measurements are&#xD;
      performed. Patients must satisfy all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria to be randomized. Information regarding consented patients who are not subsequently&#xD;
      randomized will be keep in the regulatory binder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY MEASURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments will consist of monitoring and recording adverse events (AE's) and serious&#xD;
      adverse events (SAE's). All SAE's will be reported to the FDA Med Watch within 48 business&#xD;
      hrs of site notification of such SAE. For this protocol a serious SAE will be defined as any&#xD;
      AE that is meets any of the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fatal (i.e. the AE actually causes or leads to death)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Life threatening (i.e. the AE in the view of the investigator, placing the patient at&#xD;
           immediate risk of death)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Requires or prolongs hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity (i.e. the AE results in&#xD;
           substantial disruption to the patients ability to conduct normal life functions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A congenital anomaly/birth defect in a neonate/infant born to a mother exposed to the&#xD;
           investigational product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Considered a significant medical event by the investigator (e.g, may jeopardize the&#xD;
           patient or may require medical/surgical intervention to prevent one of the outcomes&#xD;
           listed above)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA Adverse Event Reporting System Med Watch is a Reporting system for Health&#xD;
      Professionals&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL METHODS AND DETERMINATION OF SAMPLE SIZE A detailed description of the&#xD;
      statistical methodology will be provided in the statistical analysis plan (SAP) which may&#xD;
      deviate from the analysis outlined in the protocol; however, any substantial deviations from&#xD;
      the protocol will be detailed in a protocol amendment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Endpoint Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in the Modified Ashworth&#xD;
           score between Xeomin vs placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in Multiple Sclerosis Impact Scale&#xD;
                (MSIS-29) Physical and psychological scores between Xeomin vs placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in T25FW between Xeomin vs Placebo&#xD;
                group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Patient global impression of change (PGIC) between Xeomin vs placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Clinical Global Impression of change between Xeomin vs placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in Likert pain scale between Xeomin vs&#xD;
                placebo group&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Mean change from injection visit to week 6 in MSWS-12 between Xeomin vs placebo&#xD;
                group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demography and Baseline Disease Characteristics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic and baseline characteristics will be presented descriptively (i.e., mean,&#xD;
           standard deviation, median, range) and analyzed with appropriate statistical methods&#xD;
           given the distribution and type of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis Population The Intent-to-Treat population is defined as all subjects who&#xD;
           receive at least 1 dose of study treatment and who provide efficacy assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General Methods of Analysis Descriptive statistics will be provided for all efficacy&#xD;
           endpoints. A two-sided test, p-value and confidence interval will be presented for&#xD;
           analysis in general.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Primary Endpoint Analysis The primary endpoint is the mean change from injection visit&#xD;
           to week 6 in Modified Ashworth score . A two sample T-test will be used to compare the&#xD;
           treatment difference between Xeomin and placebo group. If the data is not normally&#xD;
           distributed, Wilcoxon's rank sum test will be used for the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary Endpoints Analysis Percent change from injection visit to week 6 will be&#xD;
           calculated for the primary endpoint. It will be analyzed similarly as that for the&#xD;
           primary endpoint. For secondary endpoints MSIS 29, T25FW, Likert pain scale and MSWS-12&#xD;
           a similar statistical approach as outlined for the primary endpoint will be used to&#xD;
           assess the mean changes from injection visit to week 6 in each of the scales between&#xD;
           treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient global impression of change (PGIC) and clinical global Impression of change will be&#xD;
      analyzed using the Wilcoxon's rank sum test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Analysis Population The safety population is defined as all subjects who receive at&#xD;
           least 1 dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events will be listed. Serious AE will be listed as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Considerations Based on observational study, patients using Xeomin had an&#xD;
      improvement of 50% on the Ashworth scale. A sample size of 15 patients per group will provide&#xD;
      80% power to detect a treatment difference of 50% with a 0.05 two-sided significance level&#xD;
      using a chi-square test.&#xD;
