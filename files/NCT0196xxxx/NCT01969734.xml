      Despite the best medical therapy many people with emphysema remain breathless and limited in&#xD;
      their daily activities. In emphysema the lungs do not empty properly when the person breathes&#xD;
      out. This &quot;gas trapping&quot; makes it harder to breathe. Endobronchial valve placement, a&#xD;
      treatment that stops air getting into the worst affected parts of the lung and so stops them&#xD;
      from trapping gas, improves lung function, breathlessness and exercise capacity in selected&#xD;
      patients with severe COPD (chronic obstructive airways disease, sometimes referred to as&#xD;
      emphysema). We want to see if people with less severe COPD who are very breathless can&#xD;
      benefit from the same treatment. The treatment involves placing small valves into the airways&#xD;
      using a fibre optic camera (a bronchoscopy). Bronchoscopy is a standard clinical procedure&#xD;
      carried out in our department.&#xD;

      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary disease (COPD) is a common condition that affects millions of&#xD;
      adults worldwide with a prevalence and burden projected to increase in the coming decades.&#xD;
      This projected increase is explained by the ongoing exposure to cigarette smoke and other&#xD;
      COPD risk factors, particularly in the developing world, along with population demographic&#xD;
      changes and increasing life expectancy. The Global Burden of Disease Study predicted that by&#xD;
      2020 COPD will be ranked 5th behind ischaemic heart disease, depression, road traffic&#xD;
      accidents and cerebrovascular disease as a cause of disability-adjusted life years lost1. The&#xD;
      UK population prevalence of clinically significant COPD was estimated to be 1.7% for men and&#xD;
      1.4% for women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emphysema can be a debilitating illness and can result in death. The damaged alveoli lose&#xD;
      their elasticity, and loss of structural elements leads to collapse of the terminal&#xD;
      bronchioles on expiration. This leads to gas trapping and hyperinflation. In severe cases,&#xD;
      alveolar walls can become destroyed creating bullae and collateral ventilation. Overinflated&#xD;
      areas of lung may compress adjacent lung tissue reducing perfusion and ventilation to&#xD;
      healthier tissue. Because the principal defect in emphysema is hyperinflation owing to&#xD;
      destruction of the elastic tissue of the lung, usual medical therapies targeted at&#xD;
      alleviating dyspnoea provide only limited benefit compared to patients with other forms of&#xD;
      COPD. Therefore, non-pharmacological methods of palliating dyspnoea in this patient group&#xD;
      have been developed, specifically lung volume reduction procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung volume reduction improves function by the return of more normal respiratory muscle shape&#xD;
      and function, and also by improving the elastic recoil of the lung which in turn increases&#xD;
      the outward pull on the bronchioles. This reduces terminal bronchiole collapse and improves&#xD;
      expiratory airflow thereby reducing gas trapping. The decrease in the functional residual&#xD;
      capacity improves diaphragmatic and intercostal muscle function and reduces the work of&#xD;
      breathing. In carefully selected patients, lung volume reduction surgery (LVRS) has been&#xD;
      clearly shown to be effective at improving outcomes. It is, however, associated with&#xD;
      significant morbidity, a 5% mortality rate and a modest cost-benefit return. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      only a small minority of patients with emphysema are fit enough to undergo such major&#xD;
      surgeries, and therefore a variety of alternative less invasive techniques are being&#xD;
      developed to achieve lung volume reduction. These techniques include insertion of&#xD;
      unidirectional endobronchial valves (EBVs), lung volume reduction coils (RePneu©) to&#xD;
      internally compress hyperinflated emphysematous areas of lung, and the injection of&#xD;
      sclerosant material to induce scarring and fibrosis of the most damaged portions of lung.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endobronchial valves work by allowing air to be expelled from the treated areas of lung&#xD;
      during expiration whilst preventing inspiratory airflow, with subsequent collapse of the&#xD;
      distal lung. This results in volume loss and allows reinflation of healthier lung tissue with&#xD;
      improved ventilation-perfusion matching. The Zephyr Valve (PulmonX, Redwood City, CA, USA)&#xD;
      allows exhaled air and secretions to be expelled through or around the valve but prevent&#xD;
      ventilation to the distal lung. It is implanted using a flexible bronchoscope under conscious&#xD;
      sedation as a day case procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Valves for Emphysema palliatioN Trial (VENT) is the largest randomised controlled trial&#xD;
      of valves published to date. Endobronchial valves were placed in the most diseased lobe to&#xD;
      achieve unilateral occlusion. This trial together with its European counterpart, EuroVENT,&#xD;
      demonstrated that significant improvements in lung function, exercise capacity, and quality&#xD;
      of life could be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endobronchial valve insertion appears safe with the most commonly reported complications&#xD;
      being COPD exacerbation and small volume haemoptysis. Pneumothoraces are a more significant&#xD;
      complication but have only been reported at rates below 5% in these studies, although the&#xD;
      true rate in clinical practice with correctly chosen patients is likely to be nearer 20% (a&#xD;
      significant proportion of patients in the above trials did not have complete fissures, and&#xD;
      therefore would not be expected to have significant volume loss and hence pneumothorax).&#xD;
      Endobronchial valves are easily removed should the need arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The criteria for patient selection are currently very specific, limiting the procedure to a&#xD;
      small subgroup of patients with emphysema - specifically those with an FEV1 &lt;45%. However,&#xD;
      the aim of EBV therapy is to reduce hyperinflation by deflating the most disease areas of&#xD;
      lung, resulting in improved respiratory mechanics and a greater inspiratory capacity, rather&#xD;
      than to correct airflow obstruction. In spite of significant reductions in the amount of&#xD;
      trapped gas, or residual volume (RV), in the lungs of patients treated with EBVs, some&#xD;
      patients see only modest improvements in functional outcomes such as the 6 minute walking&#xD;
      test. Airflow limitation alone causes reductions in exercise capacity, and it may be that&#xD;
      this limits treated patients even in the face of a reduction in the RV. Therefore, patients&#xD;
      with severe hyperinflation and limiting breathlessness (MRC dyspnoea score 3/5 or greater)&#xD;
      but relatively well preserved FEV1 might be expected to derive greater benefits in terms of&#xD;
      functional and patient reported outcomes as they will not be as limited by airflow&#xD;
      obstruction after the procedure.&#xD;
