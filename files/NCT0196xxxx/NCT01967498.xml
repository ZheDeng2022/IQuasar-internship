      The purpose of our double-blind, placebo controlled study is to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      montelukast therapy might be associated with improved hearing in certain sub populations of&#xD;
      children suffering from OME.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic otitis media with effusion is a common problem in children that sometimes causes&#xD;
      hearing impairment which may affect language development and quality of life of the child.&#xD;
      The standard treatment is surgical insertion of ventilation tubes. In the pediatric&#xD;
      population this procedure is preformed under general anesthesia and is associated with quite&#xD;
      a few possible complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we will examine the effects of conservative treatment with montelukast on the&#xD;
      resolution of the effusion without surgical treatment .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montelukast is a selective leukotriene receptor antagonist that is widely used for children&#xD;
      with asthma1. Allergic rhinitis in children is one of the approved indications for&#xD;
      Montelukast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Montelukast's effect on OME has been studied in several previous studies. In 2004 a study by&#xD;
      Combs JT2 showed efficacy of 49% of Montelukast in clearing persistent OME post-AOM. This&#xD;
      study was not directed at patients with chronic OME and did not use audiometry as an&#xD;
      endpoint. Another study from 2005 by Balatsouras DG studied the effect of montelukast on OME&#xD;
      in children suffering from co-existing asthma. The rate of OME resolution after one month of&#xD;
      treatment was 60% as opposed to 36% in the control group. The endpoint of this study was OME&#xD;
      and not audiometry results. There was no additional followup. In 2010 Schoem SR began a&#xD;
      randomized control double blinded study testing the effect of montelukast on children with&#xD;
      confirmed OME of 2 months. Montelukast was given for one month. Although the goal was to&#xD;
      recruit 120 children, the study was halted after 38 were treated because a statistical trend&#xD;
      showed that there was no positive effect compared to the placebo group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional study was published in 2007 performed as a RCT of 77 children did not prove the&#xD;
      drug's effectiveness as a treatment for OME . This study was published as an abstract only&#xD;
      and no details of the hearing or inclusion criteria were given. Montelukast has been proven&#xD;
      effective in resolving experimental OME in a rat model although as opposed to&#xD;
      methylpresnisone it did not reduce the submucosal neutrophil infiltrate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of our double-blind, placebo controlled study is to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      montelukast therapy might be associated with improved hearing in certain sub populations of&#xD;
      children suffering from OME.&#xD;
