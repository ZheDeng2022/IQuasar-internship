  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ROS1 is a receptor tyrosine kinase with constitutive kinase activity. ROS1 was previously&#xD;
      discovered in cell lines where ROS1 fused with other proteins to act as a driver oncogene. In&#xD;
      2007, Rikova et al reported ROS1 fusion as driver mutations in NSCLC cell line (HCC78;&#xD;
      SLC34A2-ROS1) and NSCLC patient (CD74-ROS1). Li et al also found about 1% of samples&#xD;
      harboring CD74-ROS1 fusion in 202 resected lung adenocarcinomas from never smokers. The&#xD;
      incidence was as high as 10% in East Asian population. Currently there are now at least 13&#xD;
      ROS1 fusion variants involving 8 fusion partners (CD74-, SLC34A2-, FIG-, TPM3-, SDC4-,&#xD;
      LRIG3-, ERZ-, KDERL2-) identified in ROS1 positive NSCLC. LDK378 is an orally highly&#xD;
      selective and potent ALK kinase inhibitor. In preclinical studies, LDK378 has much lower IC50&#xD;
      values than crizotinib in cell lines engineered to express ROS1 rearrangement (0.15 nM versus&#xD;
      3 nM) and is approximately 20-fold more potent. LDK378 is a potent inhibitor of tumor growth&#xD;
      in rodent models of both ALCL and NSCLC. We suggest a phase II trial of LDK378 in advanced&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer patients with ROS1 rearrangement. The aim of current trial is to&#xD;
      evaluate the antitumor efficacy and safety profile of LDK378 and to identify biomarker to&#xD;
      predict the tumor response to LDK378.&#xD;
