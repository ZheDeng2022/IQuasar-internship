  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Blood pressure (BP) is believed to be a major determinant of vascular disease, and BP&#xD;
      lowering is the most important goal in hypertension treatment. Thus, clinical guidelines for&#xD;
      hypertension are mainly focused on lowering mean BP. However, despite an increasing incidence&#xD;
      of stroke with age, the association between systolic BP (SBP) and the risk of stroke&#xD;
      decreases with age. This disparity highlights a gap in the link between BP and&#xD;
      vascular-related diseases (i.e., stroke). In clinical practice, visit-to-visit fluctuations&#xD;
      in BP have been largely ignored and are thought to be an unreliable finding, even though this&#xD;
      phenomenon is frequently observed. Rothwell et al. demonstrated that the visit-to-visit&#xD;
      variability in SBP was a more powerful independent predictor of stroke than mean SBP, and&#xD;
      that an increased residual variability in SBP in treated hypertensive patients was also a&#xD;
      strong predictor of stroke and coronary events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently updated (2011) hypertension guidelines from the National Institute for Health and&#xD;
      Clinical Excellence (NICE) recommend an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) [or&#xD;
      angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB)] and calcium-channel blocker (CCB) as a first line&#xD;
      drug. Although the significance of BP variability (BPV) has been illustrated, the main focus&#xD;
      of the current guidelines is to reduce systolic and diastolic BP, not BPV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the X-CELLENT study, a CCB (amlodipine) and thiazide-like diuretic drug (indapamide&#xD;
      sustained-release) led to a significant reduction in BPV, compared to an ARB (candesartan).&#xD;
      In addition, the CCB showed the most effective reduction in systolic BPV among the&#xD;
      antihypertensive drug class in a meta-analysis. However, there are no direct comparison&#xD;
      studies of a CCB and ARB on BPV. Thus, we aim to compare the systolic BPV effects of a CCB&#xD;
      versus an ARB in essential hypertensive patients. The primary hypothesis is that an ARB is&#xD;
      not inferior to a CCB in the reduction of the systolic BPV standard deviation (SD) in&#xD;
      essential hypertensive patients.&#xD;

    <description>For patients who fail to respond to 5 mg oral amlodipine daily, the dose will be titrated up to 10 mg amlodipineh. At subsequent visits, additional antihypertensive therapy (hydrochlorothiazide) will be added if systolic (&gt;140 mmHg) or diastolic (&gt;90 mmHg) BP is inadequate. Study drugs are administered once a day for 24 weeks. The dose will be titrated up if SBP is over 90 mmHg or there are no symptoms of hypotension (syncope, loss of consciousness, or orthostatic hypotension). If up-titration is not tolerable, because of side effects or hypotension, the previous dose will be administered as the final tolerable dose.</description>
