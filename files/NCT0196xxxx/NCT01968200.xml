  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline based anti-tumoral therapies are know to develop cardiac damage that could also&#xD;
      lead to heart failure. Monocentric studies proved that a treatment with ACE inhibitors (ACEi)&#xD;
      and betablockers (BB) during the first elevation of cardiac troponin is able to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of heart failure (HF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICOS-ONE trial is a multicenter randomized trial comparing two therapeutic strategies. The&#xD;
      main objective is to assess whether enalapril started concomitantly to AC-containing&#xD;
      treatments, can prevent cardiac toxicity more effectively than when enalapril is prescribed&#xD;
      to selected patients showing laboratory evidences of injury after chemotherapy, during&#xD;
      follow-up visits in 268 patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Anthracycline-containing chemotherapy is well known to cause dose-dependent, progressive&#xD;
      cardiac damage in particular left ventricular dysfunction evolving to heart failure. The&#xD;
      development of cardiac dysfunction, even asymptomatic, leads to the exclusion of cancer&#xD;
      patients from effective chemotherapy, with a possible negative impact on their oncologic&#xD;
      prognosis. The use of troponins (cTn) during cancer chemotherapy with anthracyclines (AC)&#xD;
      allows to identify early cardiac injury before the onset of left ventricular dysfunction,&#xD;
      with high predictive value. ACE inhibitors (ACEi) and betablockers (BB) prescribed to cancer&#xD;
      patients when, during the course or after the end of a chemotherapy, signs or symptoms of&#xD;
      cardiac failure are detected, have been shown to be protective in monocentric studies.&#xD;
      Prophylaxis with an ACEi, enalapril and a BB, bisoprolol in patients treated with&#xD;
      AC-chemotherapy may allow to reduce the risk of cardiovascular injury, allowing for the&#xD;
      completion of the whole scheduled antitumoral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size According to previous studies from the European Institute of Oncology IEO), an&#xD;
      increase of circulating troponin levels is estimated to be 20% in the patients treated with&#xD;
      anthracyclines at conventional dosage. 134 patients in each arm (Total sample size of 268&#xD;
      patients) are required to detect a 50% relative risk reduction in the incidence of elevated&#xD;
      troponins levels at a 2-sided alpha=0.05 and a 1-beta=0.60, taking into account a 5% drop-out&#xD;
      rate. This endpoint will allow to compare the strategy based on prevention (arm 1) with the&#xD;
      strategy guided by troponin (arm 2). Given the originality of the proposal and the limited&#xD;
      resources, this study will be exploratory in nature, waiting for a larger and adequately&#xD;
      powered clinical trial designed to observe significant differences in clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Tolerability of enalapril, valsartan and bisoprolol has been proven over several years&#xD;
      and in broad populations of cardiac patients, not only with heart failure, but also at&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk in the absence of signs or symptoms of HF. Specific unwanted effects in&#xD;
      cancer patients are not expected, based on previous experiences. Special care should be taken&#xD;
      to avoid profound hypotension induced by enalapril, valsartan and bisoprolol in these&#xD;
      patients. Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) ad Suspected and Unsuspected Serious Adverse&#xD;
      Reactions (SUSARs) will be collected and treated appropriately.&#xD;
