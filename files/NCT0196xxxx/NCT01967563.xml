    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Popular weight loss plans often restrict carbohydrates or fat. Research shows that&#xD;
      very-low-carbohydrate (ketogenic) diets lead to greater weight loss than low-fat diets.&#xD;
      Researchers want to know if eating fewer carbohydrates changes the number of calories the&#xD;
      body uses. They also want to know how a ketogenic diet affects hunger, hormones, and food&#xD;
      preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To better understand how the body responds to different diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Men 18 to 50 years old who are healthy but overweight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have 3 screening visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Medical history, physical exam, blood test, and EKG. They will eat during the&#xD;
                visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. For the week before the visit, participants will wear physical activity monitors&#xD;
                daily. They will record everything they eat and sample the special diet. At the&#xD;
                visit, they will receive an EKG and heart rate test while biking for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. For the week before the visit, participants will wear the physical activity&#xD;
                monitors. They will eat all their meals from the special diet that will be&#xD;
                provided. At the visit, they will answer questions and bike for 60 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After screening, for 1 week, participants will visit the clinic daily to receive that&#xD;
           day s food. They will not eat or drink anything else except water.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Then participants will stay at the clinic for 8 weeks. They cannot leave but can have&#xD;
           visitors. Participants will wear physical activity monitors, bike daily, and follow&#xD;
           different diets. Tests will be given daily, and may include weighing, X-rays, and blood&#xD;
           and urine tests. They will spend several days in a monitored room to test oxygen and&#xD;
           carbon dioxide.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Popular weight loss strategies often prescribe targeted reduction of dietary carbohydrate or&#xD;
      fat. Recent clinical trials in obese subjects have found that low-carbohydrate diets result&#xD;
      in greater weight loss compared with low-fat diets on a time scale of months when diet&#xD;
      adherence was likely the highest. One hypothesis regarding the mechanism of improved weight&#xD;
      loss with low carbohydrate diets is that such diets significantly modify the body s hormonal&#xD;
      milieu to influence metabolic regulation and energy expenditure. Low-carbohydrate diets may&#xD;
      thereby offer a metabolic advantage over low fat diets. In addition, low-carbohydrate diets&#xD;
      may also decrease hunger or increase satiety compared to low-fat diets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determining the mechanism whereby one diet leads to greater weight loss than another is&#xD;
      hampered by the inability to accurately measure food intake or physical activity in an&#xD;
      outpatient setting. Thus, an inpatient feeding study lasting many weeks is required to&#xD;
      accurately measure energy balance differences between isocaloric diets that differ in&#xD;
      macronutrient composition. In this pilot multicenter cross-over study in 16 overweight and&#xD;
      class I obese men, we will measure changes in energy expenditure in response to 4 weeks of&#xD;
      inpatient feeding of a eucaloric, very low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet (5% Carbohydrate, 15%&#xD;
      Protein, 80% Fat) immediately following an inpatient period of at least 4 weeks of consuming&#xD;
      an energy balanced standard American diet (50% Carbohydrate, 15 % Protein, 35% Fat).&#xD;
