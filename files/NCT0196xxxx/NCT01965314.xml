    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that virtual reality based training offers an additional learning&#xD;
      benefit over standard training (using cadaveric dissection and human volunteers) in preparing&#xD;
      novice anaesthetists to perform their first Ultrasound guided Axillary Brachial Plexus&#xD;
      Blockade (USgABPB) in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hope that this body of work will aid the development of a visuo-haptic&#xD;
      simulator used to improved training of doctors in performing USgABPB. Ultimately any patient&#xD;
      having this procedure carried out in the future should benefit. In particular it will avoid&#xD;
      the need for novice trainees to practice new techniques on patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ultrasound guided axillary brachial plexus blockade (USgABPB) is a commonly performed medical&#xD;
      procedure which enables the performance of surgery on the upper limb without general&#xD;
      anaesthesia. Its competent performance entails complex, simultaneous interactions between&#xD;
      three processes. These are active management of the patient, acquisition and interpretation&#xD;
      of ultrasound images, and the placement a needle tip close to specific nerves to facilitate&#xD;
      deposition of local anaesthetic. Currently, the procedure is taught using two-dimensional&#xD;
      drawings, cadaveric specimens, videos, 3D animations, live demonstrations, and/or supervised&#xD;
      clinical practice. Simulated practice, using tofu-based or animal models, have been used to&#xD;
      bridge the gap from knowledge to clinical performance. Training in medical procedural skills&#xD;
      is currently undergoing important change. Factors including altered patient expectations and&#xD;
      the European Working Time Directive (2000/34/EC amending Directive 93/104/EC) limit the&#xD;
      number of clinical learning opportunities available to trainees. These changes are likely to&#xD;
      decrease particularly the number of opportunities for trainees to learn and practice&#xD;
      procedural skills in a clinical setting. The traditional Halstedian apprenticeship model of&#xD;
      medical training is being challenged. In this model, training is associated with&#xD;
      progressively less supervision as part of progressive independence. &quot;See one, do one&quot; is no&#xD;
      longer an appropriate method for teaching procedural skills because patients are necessarily&#xD;
      exposed to inexperienced practitioners. This model requires a large investment of time by&#xD;
      both trainer and trainee in the clinical environment. Its application decreases the&#xD;
      efficiency of operating room activity. These circumstances pose medical trainers and training&#xD;
      bodies with a dilemma, a decrease in the number of individual opportunities implies that the&#xD;
      total duration of training should increase or a lesser level of competence accepted at&#xD;
      completion of training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation has been used widely for training in and assessment of medical procedural skills.&#xD;
      Applied to essential anaesthetic skills, simulation may be more efficient than the&#xD;
      apprenticeship approach. This may offer a partial solution to the problem of limited clinical&#xD;
      learning opportunities for USgPNB. Simulated practice with formative feedback has been shown&#xD;
      to be of benefit in the rapid acquisition of basic ultrasound skills by inexperienced&#xD;
      clinicians. Ultimately, the purpose of simulated practice of medical procedures is to enhance&#xD;
      clinical performance. One proven important role for simulation is to prepare novice&#xD;
      clinicians to bridge the gap between acquiring knowledge and initial clinical performance.&#xD;
      Significantly, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has recently mandated that clinicians&#xD;
      who perform carotid stenting using a particular stent should train to a defined level of&#xD;
      proficiency on a simulator before they perform the procedure on a patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With institutional ethical approval and having obtained written informed consent from&#xD;
      participants (patients and anaesthetists) 20 College of Anaesthetists (RCSI) affiliated&#xD;
      trainees who have no experience of performing ultrasound guided regional anaesthesia will be&#xD;
      recruited. Participating anaesthetists will provide baseline personal data including previous&#xD;
      experience with peripheral nerve blockade and simulators, using a web-based collection&#xD;
      facility (www.surveymonkey.com or similar). They will perform baseline psychomotor tests&#xD;
      prior to beginning training. Baseline visuo-spatial ability will be assessed using the card&#xD;
      rotation, cube comparison, and map planning tests (Educational Testing Service) or similar.&#xD;
      Psychomotor ability will be assessed using a grooved pegboard (Lafayette Instruments,&#xD;
      Lafayette, IN) or similar. All participating anaesthetists will receive standardized two hour&#xD;
      didactic training encompassing relevant anatomy, ultrasound (physics, function and&#xD;
      interpretation), pharmacology of relevant agents, indications/ contraindications of the block&#xD;
      and complications of the procedure. Participants will be taught to perform USgABPB using a&#xD;
      technique as described in Appendix IV and V of 'The American Society of Regional Anesthesia&#xD;
      and Pain Medicine and the European Society of Regional Anaesthesia and Pain Therapy Joint&#xD;
      Committee Recommendations for Education and Training in Ultrasound-Guided Regional&#xD;
      Anesthesia'. This technique uses a transverse (or short-axis) view, on ultrasound imaging, of&#xD;
      the axillary brachial plexus and axillary blood vessels. The needle is inserted in a sterile&#xD;
      fashion using an 'in-plane' approach, that is, the needle shaft and tip will remain visible&#xD;
      on ultrasound view throughout it course towards the relevant nerves. Following this initial&#xD;
      period of common training subjects will be randomly allocated (using computer generated&#xD;
      random numbers) to one of two groups of equal size for additional training which will occur&#xD;
      in parallel over a two hour period, namely a simulator trained group (SG) or a control group&#xD;
      (CG). Following the educational intervention all subjects will be asked to give written&#xD;
      feedback on the content and delivery of the session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional training TG subjects will be offered multimodal training. This will be comprised&#xD;
      of demonstration by suitably trained individuals of relevant anatomy using pre-existing&#xD;
      cadaveric samples, performing ultrasound scans of the relevant areas on volunteers under&#xD;
      expert supervision, and the practice of needle insertion under ultrasound-guidance using&#xD;
      commonly used tissue phantoms (turkey breasts). All ultrasound examinations performed on&#xD;
      volunteers or during the clinical performance on patients will use a Sonosite M Turbo (or&#xD;
      similar device) with a 7-12 MHz 38mm linear probe. This training session will last two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulator training In addition to traditional training the SG group will participate in a&#xD;
      period of simulator based training. Following initial familiarization with the simulator SG&#xD;
      participants will identify relevant structures and follow their course in the virtual arm.&#xD;
      They will insert a virtual needle into the virtual environment and advance it using an&#xD;
      in-plane technique towards various target structures. They will be given immediate directed&#xD;
      feedback by an expert and offered the opportunity for repetitive, deliberate practice. The&#xD;
      simulator, which SG participants will use, will comprise of a PHANTOM Desktop&#xD;
      (http://www.sensable.com/), an haptic immersive workbench and the H3D API&#xD;
      (http://www.sensegraphics.se/). The SG subject will scan and perform procedure specific tasks&#xD;
      on a virtual arm. The model of the arm will be informed using MRI or ultrasound supervolume&#xD;
      DICOM datasets. This training session will last two hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment Within two weeks of the educational intervention all participants' first clinical&#xD;
      performance of an ultrasound guided nerve block, specifically an ultrasound guided axillary&#xD;
      brachial plexus blockade, will be video recorded for subsequent analysis by two experts in&#xD;
      UGRA. Patients involved will require anaesthesia for forearm/wrist/hand surgery where USgABPB&#xD;
      would ordinarily be offered as standard care. Subsequent care of the patient may include&#xD;
      general anaesthesia, as clinically indicated. Intravenous sedation will be offered and&#xD;
      administered as clinically indicated (Midazolam up to a maximum of 0.05mg/kg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will perform the procedure, using an in-plane approach and short-axis view (see&#xD;
      above), in the presence of a supervising trainer, blinded to training group, who is available&#xD;
      to intervene if required, for patient safety, or requested by the subjects themselves.&#xD;
      Patients involved will also be blinded to subject allocation. Using a video recording device&#xD;
      Sony Handycam HDR-XR520VE, or similar, the performance of a clinician indicated USgABPB for a&#xD;
      scheduled operation on patients will be recorded. The video-taping will target primarily the&#xD;
      anaesthetist performing the clinically indicated ultrasound guided regional anaesthetic&#xD;
      technique in the usual fashion at Cork University Hospital. The recording will proceed in a&#xD;
      manner aimed to conceal the identity of the patient and maintain confidentiality. All efforts&#xD;
      will be taken to ensure the recording will not include images of the patients face. For the&#xD;
      purpose of blinding, a similar effort will be made conceal the identity of the anaesthetists&#xD;
      performing the block by avoiding shots of their faces. The recording will include a pan shot&#xD;
      of the setup of the room the block will take place in. This will indicate the location of the&#xD;
      patient, the ultrasound machine, the trolley with the sterile equipment required, the&#xD;
      assistant, the monitor, the emergency drugs, and the anaesthetist performing the block.&#xD;
      Before commencing the block the camera will be fixed in position focusing on the axilla, with&#xD;
      needle insertion site, ultrasound probe and the movements of the anaesthetist's hands&#xD;
      recorded. The acquired ultrasound image will be recorded concurrently. After expert&#xD;
      assessment of trainee performance and completion of the dataset all recorded video will be&#xD;
      destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of the study the subjects will be give some specific directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Position the patient and equipment appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. They will be asked to perform a pre-procedure ultrasonic survey of the relevant area,&#xD;
           specifically identifying the four relevant nerves (musculocutaneous, radial, median, and&#xD;
           ulnar).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform a sterile four nerve ultrasound-guided axillary brachial plexus block, utilizing&#xD;
           a single skin entry point (where possible), short axis view of the brachial plexus, and&#xD;
           needle in-plane approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. They will be asked to demonstrate the effectiveness of the blockade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the recorded performance of the procedure the subjects will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      written questionnaire indicating their confidence in performing the procedure and their&#xD;
      perception of the influence of external stressors (including the presence of a camera).&#xD;
