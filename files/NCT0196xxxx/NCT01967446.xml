      The Investigators hypothesize that functional status scores in elderly women undergoing&#xD;
      surgery for pelvic organ prolapse will be lower at 6 weeks post-operatively but will have&#xD;
      returned to baseline at 12 weeks post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigators hypothesize that greater co-morbidity, frailty and worse functional status&#xD;
      before surgery are associated with slower functional recovery, prolonged length of stay in a&#xD;
      hospital or nursing care institution and greater post-operative complications following&#xD;
      surgery for pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An increasing number of elderly women are undergoing surgical treatment for pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse (POP). Based on US Census data1 and the estimated prevalence of pelvic organ&#xD;
      prolapse in women 60 and over, an estimated 1.6 million women over 60 are currently affected&#xD;
      with pelvic organ prolapse (POP). This number is expected to increase to 3.4 million by 2050.&#xD;
      Prior studies show that geriatric patients have unique physiologic vulnerability, and elderly&#xD;
      women undergoing surgery are at risk for worse post-operative outcomes than younger women.&#xD;
      However, data from the urogynecology literature are conflicting. Some studies show an&#xD;
      increased risk for complications as women age while other studies show no significant&#xD;
      increased risk. Other evidence suggests that elderly women still are below their baseline&#xD;
      quality-of-life status 6 weeks post-operatively. Return to baseline functional status at 6&#xD;
      weeks post-operatively was not improved when these women were randomized to enhanced&#xD;
      pre-operative geriatric assessment versus routine care. These studies were limited by low&#xD;
      numbers of very old women and women undergoing obliterative surgery, usually recommended for&#xD;
      women with higher co-morbidities and lower functional status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative outcomes have been traditionally measured in terms of medically documented&#xD;
      complications such as infection, organ injury, cardiac and pulmonary complications. However,&#xD;
      studies from other surgical specialties suggest that older subjects undergoing surgery can&#xD;
      suffer from significant worsening of functional status resulting in disability, need for&#xD;
      long-term care, and dependency at home. Objective markers of functional status, co-morbidity&#xD;
      and frailty are potential useful predictors of post-operative complications following surgery&#xD;
      in the elderly. However, there is lack of data on the functional status of elderly women&#xD;
      undergoing POP surgery, as well as on factors influencing recovery from surgery. The goal of&#xD;
      our study is to explore the utility of pre-operative markers of functional status,&#xD;
      co-morbidities and frailty to explain post-operative morbidities in elderly women undergoing&#xD;
      surgical treatment for pelvic organ prolapse.&#xD;

        Women will be recruited from 3 sites in the University of Pennsylvania Health System: 1)&#xD;
        the Division of Urogynecology (OB/GYN) at Hospital of University of Pennsylvania (HUP) 2)&#xD;
        the Division of Urogynecology (OB/GYN) at Pennsylvania Hospital (PAH) and 3) Division of&#xD;
        Urology (Surgery) at Pennsylvania Hospital (PAH). Approximately 60 women age 60 or over&#xD;
        undergo surgery for POP at HUP and 45 each in Urogynecology and Urology at PAH each year.&#xD;
        This yields an eligible population of more than 150 women during the 1.25-year proposed&#xD;
        recruitment period. We anticipate that interest in the study will be high because the study&#xD;
        is investigating post-operative recovery and no invasive testing is planned.&#xD;
