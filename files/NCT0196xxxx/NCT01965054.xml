    <textblock>
      Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a unique disease of the liver resulting in&#xD;
      abnormal bile acid levels and liver function. The incidence of ICP ranges from 0.1 - 15.6%.&#xD;
      Women diagnosed with ICP most often present with itching, which may be severe. More&#xD;
      concerning, however, is the impact of ICP on adverse fetal and pregnancy outcomes, including&#xD;
      preterm delivery, meconium exposure, fetal demise, and increased neonatal respiratory&#xD;
      complications. The risk for fetal demise has been estimated to be 1-3%. The mechanism of&#xD;
      fetal demise in ICP is unknown, and therefore cannot be reliably predicted. There is evidence&#xD;
      to suggest that extremely elevated bile acids levels are associated with worse fetal&#xD;
      outcomes, particularly levels greater than 40 μmol/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ursodeoxycholic acid (UDCA) has anticholestatic effects, and is used to treat a variety of&#xD;
      cholestatic liver diseases. Many studies have demonstrated superiority of UDCA over other&#xD;
      agents, including dexamethasone and cholestyramine, for relief of maternal pruritus,&#xD;
      improvement in transaminitis, reduction in serum bile acid concentrations, and improved&#xD;
      pregnancy outcomes. As a result, UDCA is now widely used as first-line treatment for&#xD;
      symptomatic relief in patients with ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) are two omega-3 long chain&#xD;
      polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish. DHA is known to play a key role in early fetal&#xD;
      brain development, and has been associated with modest beneficial effects on&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcomes in children. In neonates with parental&#xD;
      nutrition-induced cholestasis (PN-cholestasis), parental fish oil has been shown to be&#xD;
      hepatoprotective not only for treatment of PN-cholestasis, but for prevention of cholestasis&#xD;
      in premature infants at risk for the disease. Our hypothesis is that fish oil supplementation&#xD;
      with DHA in women with ICP who are treated with UDCA will increase the rate of decline in&#xD;
      serum total bile acid levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The incidence of ICP at a single hospital center in Queens, NY is estimated to be 5%&#xD;
      secondary to a high concentration of patients from high-risk ethnic groups. High risk&#xD;
      patients with bile acid levels greater than or equal to 40 μmol/L are managed aggressively&#xD;
      with inpatient admission for continuous fetal monitoring, treatment with UDCA, and serial&#xD;
      total bile acid levels weekly. These are patients are routinely offered early delivery after&#xD;
      documented fetal lung maturity between 36 and 37 weeks gestation, or for any signs of fetal&#xD;
      distress. This study is a prospective randomized controlled trial comparing weekly serum&#xD;
      total bile acid levels in women admitted for inpatient management of ICP among women&#xD;
      supplemented with a standard prenatal vitamin versus supplementation with a prenatal vitamin&#xD;
      and DHA.&#xD;

      Intrahepatic cholestasis of pregnancy (ICP) is a unique disease of the liver resulting in&#xD;
      abnormal bile acid levels and liver function. In the literature, the incidence of ICP ranges&#xD;
      from 0.1 - 15.6%.[1] Women diagnosed with ICP most often present with itching, which may be&#xD;
      severe. More concerning, however, is the impact of ICP on adverse fetal and pregnancy&#xD;
      outcomes, including preterm delivery, meconium exposure, fetal demise, and increased neonatal&#xD;
      respiratory complications. The risk for fetal demise has been estimated to be 1-3%. The&#xD;
      mechanism of fetal demise in ICP is unknown, and therefore cannot be reliably predicted.&#xD;
      There is evidence to suggest that extremely elevated bile acids levels are associated with&#xD;
      worse fetal outcomes, particularly levels greater than 40 μmol/L.[3] Ursodeoxycholic acid&#xD;
      (UDCA) improves impaired hepatocellular secretion by stimulating canalicular bile acid&#xD;
      transporter protein expression, and is now widely used as first-line treatment for&#xD;
      symptomatic relief in patients with ICP. [1] Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) and eicosapentaenoic&#xD;
      acid (EPA) are two omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acids found in fish. DHA is known&#xD;
      to play a key role in early fetal brain development, and has been associated with modest&#xD;
      beneficial effects on neurodevelopmental and cognitive outcomes in children.[2] In neonates&#xD;
      with parental nutrition-induced cholestasis (PN-cholestasis), parental fish oil has been&#xD;
      shown to be hepatoprotective not only for treatment of PN-cholestasis, but for prevention of&#xD;
      cholestasis in premature infants at risk for the disease.[3-5] The incidence of ICP at a&#xD;
      single hospital center in Queens, NY is estimated to be 5% secondary to a high concentration&#xD;
      of patients from high-risk ethnic groups. High risk patients with bile acid levels greater&#xD;
      than or equal to 40 μmol/L are managed aggressively with inpatient admission for continuous&#xD;
      fetal monitoring, treatment with UDCA, and serial total bile acid levels weekly, and are&#xD;
      routinely offered early delivery after documented fetal lung maturity between 36 and 37 weeks&#xD;
      gestation, or for any signs of fetal distress. This study is a prospective randomized trial&#xD;
      of women diagnosed with ICP prior to 36 weeks who are admitted to Elmhurst Hospital for&#xD;
      inpatient observation. Women will be randomized to receiving a standard prenatal vitamin&#xD;
      daily or a prenatal vitamin plus fish oil supplementation in addition to the standard UDCA&#xD;
      300mg by mouth three times daily. Dietary fish intake for each subject will be recorded.&#xD;
      Total bile acid serum levels will be followed weekly, and fetal monitoring with daily&#xD;
      non-stress tests will be performed on all women as per standard care for ICP at Elmhurst&#xD;
      hospital. The primary outcome of interest is a 20% reduction in serum total bile acid levels&#xD;
      in the treatment group compared to the control group at each time point. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      of interest include changes in maternal symptoms as measured using a validated itching score,&#xD;
      changes in UDCA dosing, length of hospital stay, and neonatal outcomes including gestational&#xD;
      age at delivery, Apgar scores, neonatal intensive care unit admissions, neonatal length of&#xD;
      stay, meconium aspiration, birth weight, and perinatal mortality. Assuming 80% statistical&#xD;
      power and a significance level of 0.05 to detect a 20% reduction in serum total bile acids in&#xD;
      the treatment group compared to the placebo group, a total of 100 patients in each arm is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
