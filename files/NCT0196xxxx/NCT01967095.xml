  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the safety of different ways of taking erlotinib. The&#xD;
      investigators want to find out what effects, good and/or bad, combination daily low dose and&#xD;
      twice weekly high dose erlotinib has on the patient and lung cancer. The investigators are&#xD;
      also seeing whether different schedules of erlotinib are better at treating lung cancer that&#xD;
      has spread to the central nervous system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CNS expansion phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pulse continuous regimen will be then assess in patients with EGFR mutant lung cancers&#xD;
      and CNS involvement. An additional expansion cohort (A) will enroll 19 patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed EGFR mutant lung cancer with CNS involvement at diagnosis. The patients in the&#xD;
      expansion cohorts will undergo the same treatment plan as the patients in the dose expansion&#xD;
      cohort. A patient in the expansion cohorts will not be replaced if he/she does not finish the&#xD;
      first 28 day (cycle 1) treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>This protocol is a phase 1, single arm, open label study of combination daily low dose erlotinib plus twice weekly high dose erlotinib in patients with EGFR-Mutant lung cancer who have not yet received erlotinib or gefitinib. Six dose levels are planned for escalation, with the pulse dose erlotinib increasing.&#xD;

    <description>Cycle 1, week 1 (D1-D7) will consist of pulse dose erlotinib on D1 &amp; D2 without daily low dose erlotinib on D3-7. For all subsequent weeks, patients will take high dose erlotinib on D1 &amp; D2, &amp; will receive erlotinib 50 mg oral daily x 5 days on days 3-7. On days 1 &amp; 2, patients will take one of the following doses of erlotinib, depending on the dose cohort they are enrolled in: Dose level 1 600 mg oral daily on D1, D2 Dose level 2 750 mg oral daily on D1, D2 Dose level 3 900 mg oral daily on D1, D2 Dose level 4 1050 mg oral daily on D1, D2. An additional Dose -1 (pulse dose erlotinib on D1, D2 with 25 mg oral daily x 5 days in D3-D7) will be reserved, in the unlikely situation that Dose 1 is proved too toxic. If Dose -1 is tolerated well (600mg oral daily D1, D2 &amp; 25mg oral daily D3-D7), pulse dose escalation can continue as described above, with erlotinib at the daily low dose of 25 mg oral on D3-D7.</description>
