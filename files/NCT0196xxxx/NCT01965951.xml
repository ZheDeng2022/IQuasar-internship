  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Problems with attention are a common and debilitating consequence of brain injury. Studies&#xD;
      show that poor attention is the number one predictor of poor cognitive functioning one year&#xD;
      post-injury. This is due to the fact that attention is a necessary component of more complex&#xD;
      cognitive functions such as learning &amp; memory, multi-tasking and problem solving. In many&#xD;
      cases, individuals may exhibit problems with spatial attention known as 'hemi-spatial neglect&#xD;
      syndrome' or simply 'neglect'. Many studies now show that the processing machinery of the&#xD;
      brain is plastic and remodeled throughout life by learning and experience, enabling the&#xD;
      strengthening of cognitive skills or abilities. Research has shown that brief, daily&#xD;
      computerized cognitive training that is sufficiently challenging, goal-directed and adaptive&#xD;
      enables intact brain structures to restore balance in attention and compensate for&#xD;
      disruptions in cognitive functioning. The study aims to understand how our computer program&#xD;
      can affect cognition and attention in those with acquired brain injury.&#xD;

      Following consent, participants will engage in an assessment process to determine&#xD;
      eligibility. Once eligibility is confirmed, participants will be scheduled for another&#xD;
      assessment session to determine current level of cognitive function. This process consists of&#xD;
      paper-pencil surveys and computerized tests. Following the assessment process, participants&#xD;
      will engage in an Internet browser-delivered training sessions conducted on any&#xD;
      internet-accessible computer. The computerized training sessions can be done up to 7 times a&#xD;
      week (once a day) or at participant's convenience (we recommend 5 times a week). Following&#xD;
      the completion of training, the participant's cognitive function will be re-assessed and&#xD;
      again after 3-month no-contact period. Participation is voluntary and participants may&#xD;
      withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
