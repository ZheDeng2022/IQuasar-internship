    <textblock>
      In the history of TKA several different types of prosthetic designs have been evolved in&#xD;
      order to optimize knee function after total knee replacement. The most common difference&#xD;
      between the prosthetic designs revolves around issues concerning the preservation of the&#xD;
      cruciate ligaments. The most popular prostheses have been the posterior stabilized prosthesis&#xD;
      (PS) in which both cruciate ligaments are resected and the posterior cruciate retaining&#xD;
      prosthesis (CR) in which only ACL is resected and PCL is preserved. Both these prosthetic&#xD;
      designs have shown excellent clinical results in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the knee the role of the cruciate ligaments is to insure anterior/posterior stability, but&#xD;
      studies have also shown, that the cruciate ligaments contain proprioceptive mechanisms which&#xD;
      control joint kinematics essential for accurate knee function. One could therefore imagine&#xD;
      that a prosthetic design that preserves both cruciate ligaments would be superior to&#xD;
      prosthetic designs in which ACL or ACL/PCL is resected in achieving good clinical results and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Only a few prosthetic designs, which preserve both cruciate ligaments, have been available to&#xD;
      the market. However studies based on fluoroscopic assays and gait analysis has shown that&#xD;
      this prosthetic design is superior to cruciate sacrificing designs in preserving normal knee&#xD;
      kinematics during activities of daily living after TKA. Studies, in which patients have&#xD;
      received two different types of prosthesis in each knee, have also shown that bi-cruciate&#xD;
      retaining TKA's is preferred, when compared to more constrained prosthetic designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new Vanguard XP TKA system (Biomet®, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) is a further development of&#xD;
      the Vanguard TKA system, which has shown good clinical results in earlier studies. With the&#xD;
      new Vanguard XP system both cruciate ligaments are preserved. In theory this should result in&#xD;
      a more natural feeling of the knee because the stability and proprioceptive signals from both&#xD;
      cruciate ligaments are preserved. In order to investigate the potential benefits of this new&#xD;
      prosthetic design, the clinical and radiological results of knees receiving a Vanguard XP and&#xD;
      Vanguard CR prostheses are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we wish to investigate:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will influence the migration of the femur- and&#xD;
           tibial components measured by Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) when compared to the&#xD;
           Vanguard CR prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will result in increased participant knee&#xD;
           function, satisfaction and quality of life when compared to the Vanguard CR prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will influence radiologic signs of osteolysis,&#xD;
           complication rates and revision rates when compared to the Vanguard CR prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project is carried out as a randomized controlled double-blinded trial, in which the&#xD;
      clinical and radiological outcomes after treatment of knee osteoarthritis with insertion of&#xD;
      either a Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis is compared.&#xD;

      1. Objectives Primary objective The primary objective of this study is to compare stability&#xD;
           and fixation by RSA of Vanguard XP to that of Vanguard CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective Secondary objective of this study is to assess the patient reported&#xD;
      outcomes of Vanguard XP in comparison to Vanguard CR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Background The primary goal of Total Knee Replacement surgery in the treatment of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis is to reduce pain and restore knee function (stability and range of motion) in&#xD;
      order to increase patient mobility and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Copenhagen University Hospital of Hvidovre, patients with severe osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
      knee are treated with insertion of a cemented total knee prosthesis in which the anterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament is resected and the posterior cruciate ligament is retained (CR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the history of TKA several different types of prosthetic designs have been evolved in&#xD;

      the market. However studies based on fluoroscopic assays and gait analysis has shown that&#xD;
      this prosthetic design is superior to cruciate sacrificing designs in preserving normal knee&#xD;
      kinematics during activities of daily living after TKA13-16. Studies, in which patients have&#xD;
      received two different types of prosthesis in each knee, have also shown that bi-cruciate&#xD;
      retaining TKA's is preferred, when compared to more constrained prosthetic designs17-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The new Vanguard XP TKA system (Biomet®, Warsaw, Indiana, USA) is a further development of&#xD;
      the Vanguard TKA system, which has shown good clinical results in earlier studies11-12. With&#xD;
      the new Vanguard XP system both cruciate ligaments are preserved. In theory this should&#xD;

      Vanguard XP and Vanguard CR prostheses are compared.&#xD;

&#xD;
      1) If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will influence the migration of the femur- and&#xD;
      tibial components measured by Radiostereometric Analysis (RSA) when compared to the Vanguard&#xD;
      CR prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will result in increased participant knee&#xD;
      function, satisfaction and quality of life when compared to the Vanguard CR prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3) If the use of the Vanguard XP prosthesis will influence radiologic signs of osteolysis,&#xD;
      complication rates and revision rates when compared to the Vanguard CR prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Device description Please see separate application for premarket testing. The Vanguard XP&#xD;
      (with the XP tibial tray and XP tibial bearing to be used in this study) is not yet&#xD;
      CE-marked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Project design Project type This project is carried out as a randomized controlled&#xD;
      double-blinded trial, in which the clinical and radiological outcomes after treatment of knee&#xD;
      osteoarthritis with insertion of either a Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis are compared.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent is obtained, participants are randomized to receive either a Vanguard&#xD;
      XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis. Allocation of the patient to one of the two treatment groups is&#xD;
      done in the operating room after surgical verification of both cruciate ligaments being&#xD;
      intact. Non-transparent envelopes are used for the randomization process. Participants are&#xD;
      unaware of which prosthesis they receive and the research coordinator handling the collected&#xD;
      questionnaires postoperatively is also unaware of which prosthesis the patient has received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time schedule Recruitment of participants to this project is expected to begin in October&#xD;
      2013 or as soon as permission from the local Ethics Committee and the National Board of&#xD;
      Health is obtained. 50 participants are to be randomized (25 participants in each study&#xD;
      group). Recruitment is expected completed after a period of 1 year. Inclusion and&#xD;
      randomization of approximately 5 participants per month is considered realistic regarding the&#xD;
      logistical capacity for the additional necessary studies in this study. The project is&#xD;
      expected to be completed 10 years after recruitment of the last participant (fall of 2024).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant termination At their own will participants can choose to leave the project at any&#xD;
      time. Participants can also be withdrawn from the project at any time, if this is considered&#xD;
      necessary by the investigators, e.g. in the event of deep infection leading to replacement of&#xD;
      the prosthesis or long-term immobilisation because of comorbidity. If a participant is&#xD;
      withdrawn or rescinds their consent, a &quot;Lost to Follow-up&quot; case report form will be completed&#xD;
      detailing the reason for the participant's withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data recording Data relevant for this project will be registered in a data sheet. An&#xD;
      individual data sheet will be kept for each recruited participant. Data will also be&#xD;
      aggregated and stored electronically. The storage of data will be done according to the rules&#xD;
      posted by the Danish Data Protection Agency. This project will be notified to and approved by&#xD;
      the Danish Data Protection Agency before recruitment of partisipants is initiated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Participant population 50 participants with knee osteoarthritis set to receive primary&#xD;
      cemented total knee prosthesis at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of participants 50 recruited patients (25 in each group) are randomized to receive&#xD;
      either Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may be excluded intraoperatively, before randomization, if one or both of the&#xD;
      cruciate ligaments are found to be missing or totally ruptured. We estimate that 20 % of&#xD;
      enrolled patients will be excluded due to this, and therefore recruitement of 60 patients is&#xD;
      needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to recruitement of patients for the randomized study we will conduct a pilot study&#xD;
      which will include 5 patients who will all receive the Vanguard XP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study's primary outcome measure is implant migration measured by RSA. If the minimally&#xD;
      relevant total migration of the prosthesis measured by RSA is set to 0.2 mm1 then a total of&#xD;
      18 participants must be enrolled in each study group to show a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference (95 % confidence, 80 % power).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study 2 x 25 participants are included. This will insure sufficient statistical power&#xD;
      despite a dropout of 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The power calculation is based on reaching sufficient power when a comparison of the two&#xD;
      study groups is carried out.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Prior arthroscopic surgery with surgery on anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament&#xD;
           (meniscal surgery only does not lead to exclusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior high-energy trauma to the affected knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior history of anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligament rupture.&#xD;

           examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Documented osteoporosis with patient in active medical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comorbidity with altered pain perception (e.g. DM with neuropathy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants that develop deep infection in the follow-up period are excluded from the&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding RSA assays&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Participants with less than 3 Tantalum beads visible around the Femur- or Tibia component&#xD;
      on RSA assays are excluded from the migration measurements. Data regarding secondary&#xD;
      objectives from these subjects will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding intraoperative exclusion • If the anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligaments are&#xD;
      found missing or totally ruptured at direct intraoperative visualization, patients excluded&#xD;
      at this point and will receive the department's standard prosthesis (Vanguard CR if posterior&#xD;
      cruciate ligament is intact).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Patients who receive knee prosthesis have most often reached the non-fertile age (50+). In&#xD;
      the case that a fertile woman participates in the study it will be ensured that she is not&#xD;
      pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention group After being allocated to either of the two groups, participants will&#xD;
      receive either Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis. After discharge outpatient controls are&#xD;
      carried out after 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years postoperatively. RSA assays are performed&#xD;
      postoperatively and after 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years. Patients who meet the inclusion&#xD;
      criteria but do not wish to participate in the study will receive the standard treatment for&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis at our institution, which is a cemented TKA and outpatient follow-up 3&#xD;
      months postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Methods The study is conducted in accordance with the CONSORT statement. The project in 5&#xD;
      steps&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Project information and signed consent before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Intraoperative assessment of the cruciate ligaments with exclusion of the patient if the&#xD;
           anterior and/or posterior cruciate ligaments are found missing or totally ruptured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surgery with insertion of either Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR prosthesis. Tantalum beads&#xD;
           are placed in the bone around the femur- and tibial components. Surgery is performed at&#xD;
           Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Postoperatively, participants are admitted to a dedicated fast track arthroplasty unit&#xD;
           and will receive standard treatment after TKA until discharge. Discharge criteria are&#xD;
           ability to walk &gt;70 m with crutches or better, ability to get in and out of bed as well&#xD;
           as up from a chair, and sufficient oral pain treatment. Before discharge RSA is&#xD;
           performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. 3 months and 1, 2, 5. and 10 years postoperatively participants are seen on an&#xD;
           outpatient basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, surgery time and length of hospital stay are also registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery procedure Surgery is performed as described in the manufacturer's technical guide.&#xD;
      After randomization participants will receive either a cemented Vanguard XP or Vanguard CR&#xD;
      prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of three senior surgeons (Henrik Husted, Kristian Otte, Anders Troelsen) dedicated to&#xD;
      knee arthroplasty surgery will perform all operations with an assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique: A standard medial Para patellar incision is used. Femur and tibial surfaces are&#xD;
      prepared using standard cutting guides. When the CR prosthesis is used ACL is resected and&#xD;
      PCL is spared. When the XP prosthesis is used both ACL and PCL are spared. The XP prosthesis&#xD;
      is used with a tibail tray and a bearing surface for this purpose. A minimum of six 1 mm&#xD;
      Tantalum beads are placed in the distal femur and proximal tibia. A sawbones phantom study to&#xD;
      detect optimal placement of beads will be performed prior to operation of the first patient.&#xD;
      Femur- and tibial components are cemented to the bone. Soft tissue balancing is performed to&#xD;
      ensure optimal stability and ROM. An E1-vitamin enriched polyethylene tibial liner is used.&#xD;
      Resurfacing of patella is performed in all cases. Joint capsule and subcutis are closed using&#xD;
      tied nuts. Skin is closed with staples. No drains are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperatively, participants will receive standard pain treatment and rehabilitation until&#xD;
      discharge2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements with RSA Since the 1970ies, RSA has been used to measure the migration of&#xD;
      implants in relation to the surrounding bone. Peroperatively, 1 mm Tantalum beads are placed&#xD;
      in the bone surrounding the prosthesis using a specialized instrument. Postoperatively,&#xD;
      simultaneous radiographs from two different angles are used to visualize distances between&#xD;
      the prosthesis and the Tantalum beads three-dimensionally using a special computer software&#xD;
      programme (Model Based RSA)3. Then the migration of the prosthesis over time can be&#xD;
      calculated. Migration of both the femur- and tibia components can then be calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs are performed at the Radiological Department, Copenhagen University Hospital&#xD;
      Hvidovre. Participants are placed in the supine position and the lower leg is placed on a&#xD;
      premade cushion. The x-ray tubes are placed 145 cm above the floor in a mutual angle of 44&#xD;
      degrees (+/-22 degrees relative to the sagittal axis of the participant) so that the path of&#xD;
      the beam from each x-ray tube passes through the knee of the participant. Standard x-ray&#xD;
      films are placed in a calibration box designed to Model Based RSA. Using Model Based RSA&#xD;
      software and pre-scanned models of the prosthesis, the radiographs are used to establish a&#xD;
      three-dimensional coordinate presenting the relations between the prosthesis and the Tantalum&#xD;
      beads. Distances between the Tantalum beads and the prosthesis can be calculated and&#xD;
      subsequently used to calculate migration of the prosthesis over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be able to calculate migration of the prosthesis, at least three Tantalum beads&#xD;
      around the femur- and tibial components should be visual on the RSA radiographs. If this is&#xD;
      not achieved, the participant is excluded from the migration measurements. In order to&#xD;
      address this issue at least 6 Tantalum beads are placed in the distal femur and proximal&#xD;
      tibia preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Registrations All registrations are done prospectively. Primary objectives&#xD;
      Migration/rotation: Migration of the prosthesis measured by RSA3. Implant-migration/rotation&#xD;
      is defined as changes in distances between the prosthesis and the Tantalum beads over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant perceived knee function: Participant perceived knee function is evaluated&#xD;
      preoperatively and at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up using the validated Forgotten&#xD;
      Joint Score (FJS)4 and Oxford Knee Score (OKS)5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives Health related quality of life (HRQoL): Participant perceived HRQoL is&#xD;
      evaluated preoperatively and at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up using the validated&#xD;
      EQ-5D Range of motion (ROM): Active and passive knee ROM is measured preoperatively and at 3&#xD;
      months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up using a goniometer6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periprosthetic osteolysis: Radiological signs of periprosthetic osteolysis are evaluated on&#xD;
      plain radiographs at 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knee pain: Knee pain is evaluated at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up using the&#xD;
      Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)7 in which 0 represents no pain at all and 10 represents worst&#xD;
      pain imaginable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Satisfaction with the knee: At 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and 10 years participants are asked to&#xD;
      describe their satisfaction with the knee using the VAS-scale. 0 is used when the participant&#xD;
      is maximally dissatisfied with the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expectations/fulfilment of expectations: Preoperatively participants are asked about their&#xD;
      expectations to the forthcoming knee replacement. At 1, 2, 5, and 10 years follow-up,&#xD;
      participants are asked to evaluate how well the knee replacement met their expectations using&#xD;
      the VAS-scale. 0 is used when expectations were not fulfilled at all and 10 is used when&#xD;
      expectations were fully fulfilled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery time: Duration from the start of the incision until staples are placed is documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of hospital stay: Length of hospital stay defined as from the day of surgery until&#xD;
      discharge is documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications: Thrombo-embolic complications, wound healing complications, infections, nerve&#xD;
      palsies and revisions are documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peroperative release: If peropertive release (medial, lateral, posterior) is performed in&#xD;
      order to obtain stability, this is documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Risks and adverse effects The risks in this study are related to: 1) Insertion of Tantalum&#xD;
      beads in the bone, 2) Additional radiation in relation to the RSA-assays, and 3) The use of a&#xD;
      new prosthetic design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Insertion of Tantalum beads in the bone in order to carry out RSA-assays has been done&#xD;
           increasingly over the last 25 years. In the literature, no side effects have been&#xD;
           reported regarding insertion of Tantalum beads when these have been used for RSA-assays.&#xD;
           Tantalum is also used in sutures and staples and has proven bio-convertible and without&#xD;
           tendency to corrode bone8-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In this study RSA-assays are carried out postoperatively and at 3 months, 1, 2, 5, and&#xD;
           10 years follow-up. At 3 months follow-up an additional RSA-assay is performed to ensure&#xD;
           the precision of the setup. This means that each participant is exposed to 5 additional&#xD;
           RSA-assays. The radiation dose used at each RSA-assay is equivalent to that of&#xD;
           conventional radiographs, 0.2 mSV. Each participant is therefore exposed to an&#xD;
           additional radiation dose of 1.4 mSV. The background radiation in Denmark is ≈ 2-3&#xD;
           mSV/year. The additional radiation that each participant is exposed to in this study is&#xD;
           equivalent to 6-8 months of background radiation. Therefore we believe that the&#xD;
           RSA-assays will not cause additional risks for the participants in this study10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In this study a new prosthetic design, the Vanguard XP TKA system (Biomet®, Warsaw,&#xD;
           Indiana, USA), is tested. The Vanguard XP system has obtained FDA-approval in the USA&#xD;
           and is the further development of the Vanguard system, which has shown good clinical&#xD;
           results in earlier studies11-12. We therefore find it highly relevant to investigate the&#xD;
           results of primary total knee replacement with the Vanguard XP TKA system. We do not&#xD;
           believe that the use of this new prosthetic design will cause additional risks for the&#xD;
           participants in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Investigators Surgery procedures, investigations and radiological assays are carried out&#xD;
           by trained medical doctors, nurses, physiotherapists and radiologists associated to the&#xD;
           Orthopaedic and Radiology departments at Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unintended events Unintended events are defined as any unintended and unfavourable&#xD;
           occurrences, symptoms or illnesses experienced by the participants in this study,&#xD;
           regardless of its coherence with the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Unintended events are documented continuously. Data regarding unintended events will be&#xD;
           retrieved from the participant's medical records by the primary investigator. Data from&#xD;
           participant medical records will not be disclosed to a third Party.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Severe unintended events&#xD;
&#xD;
           Severe unintended events are defined as serious unintended occurrences or side effects&#xD;
           that cause:&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Death.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Life threatening situations.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Admittance to an intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Permanent severe disabilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the case of a severe unintended event, the investigators of this study are obligated&#xD;
           to assess if the event is caused by the interventions introduced in this study, e.g. the&#xD;
           insertion of Tantalum beads in the bone. In this assessment, the following factors&#xD;
           should be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Coherence in time.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Accordance with known consequences of the treatment or investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Alternative reasons for the unintended event. If the severe unintended event is&#xD;
                considered caused by the interventions introduced in this study, the project will&#xD;
                be terminated ahead of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Ethics At Copenhagen University Hospital Hvidovre, treatment of osteoarthritis with TKA is&#xD;
      mastered on a super-specialist level. We find this study to be highly relevant regarding the&#xD;
      potential beneficial effects of the new prosthetic design (Vanguard XP) on postoperative knee&#xD;
      function and patient perceived outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is conducted in accordance with principals described in the Helsinki declaration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the study are covered by the patient insurance of Copenhagen University&#xD;
      Hospital Hvidovre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol, along with written participant information and consent declaration, is to be&#xD;
      approved by the local Ethics Committee before enrolments of participants are commenced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project will be registered at clinicaltrials.gov. The project will be approved by the&#xD;
      Danish Data Protection Agency. It is the responsibility of the primary investigator to inform&#xD;
      the local Ethics Committee if any changes are made to the protocol or if any severe adverse&#xD;
      effects occur. The primary investigator stores all correspondence regarding the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive oral and written information about the study before consent. It&#xD;
      is the responsibility of the primary investigator that the information to the participant is&#xD;
      adequate. Participants are included when signed consent from the participant is obtained.&#xD;
      Project information is then given in an undisturbed environment (in a closed examination&#xD;
      room) by an authorized investigator of this study. Project information is given at the first&#xD;
      outpatient consultation, when treatment with insertion of a TKA is decided. A nurse is&#xD;
      present when the information is given. Participants are informed about the right to having a&#xD;
      dependent present when project information is given. Participants are informed that a period&#xD;
      of consideration of at least 2 weeks is an opportunity along with the right to a second&#xD;
      consultation. Signed consent, however, is to be given latest at admittance before surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The oral information is in accordance with the written information and is adjusted to the&#xD;
      age, educational level and social conditions of the participant. It is ensured that the&#xD;
      participant has understood the content of both the oral and written information before signed&#xD;
      consent is given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the responsibility of the primary investigator that the authorized investigator is&#xD;
      adequetly informed about the study and academically qualified to giving the oral information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10. Data recordings Participants in this study are identified with an assigned allocation&#xD;
      number. At the end of the study all patient related data are destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All sensitive personal data regarding participants will be stored in accordance with&#xD;
      guidelines presented by the Personal Data Act. Personal data regarding participants will be&#xD;
      treated anonymously. The study will be reported to the Danish Data Protection Agency. The&#xD;
      primary investigator will process all data. Participants will receive oral and written&#xD;
      information concerning the handling of sensitive personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      11. Statistics The STATA statistical software will be used when processing data in this&#xD;
      study. Comparative statistics will be used based on the distribution of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12. Financial conditions This project is financed by Dept. of Orthopaedic Surgery, Copenhagen&#xD;
      University Hospital Hvidovre with finantial support from Biomet®, Warsaw, Indiana, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators of this study have independently initiated the project. Besides this study,&#xD;
      the primary investigator has no affiliation to Biomet®. 13. Publications The results of this&#xD;
      project are expected to be published in an international medical journal. The primary&#xD;
      investigator prepares the manuscript, which is approved by the remaining investigators of the&#xD;
      project. The results of this study are also expected to be presented at national and&#xD;
      international orthopaedic conventions. If publication is not achieved, the results of this&#xD;
      study (positive, negative or inconclusive) will be presented on the homepage of our&#xD;
      institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Co-authorship is awarded according to the Vancouver rules. The investigators will be the&#xD;
      authors in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Morten G. Thomsen, Henrik Husted, Kristian S. Otte, Kasper Gosvig, Anders Troelsen&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biomet will not be able to prevent publication of the results of this study.&#xD;
