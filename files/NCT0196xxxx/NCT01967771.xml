      This study will be a phase I, open label, three period, fixed sequence crossover study to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect of Carbamazepine (CBZ) on the steady-state pharmacokinetics of&#xD;
      Dolutegravir (DTG) and on the safety and tolerability of DTG. Subjects will have a screening&#xD;
      visit within 30 days prior to the first dose of study drug, three treatment periods, and a&#xD;
      follow-up visit 7-14 days after the last dose of study drug. There is no washout between&#xD;
      treatment periods.&#xD;
