    <textblock>
      This study has two goals: 1) to test an approach to helping women who use intrauterine&#xD;
      contraception (IUC) spread the word about this type of long-lasting, highly effective birth&#xD;
      control method among their friends and family and; 2) to test ways of getting in touch with&#xD;
      these women's friends and family so that we can track whether this approach is effective at&#xD;
      spreading birth control information through social groups.&#xD;

      Pilot of peer IUC intervention We will assess its feasibility and acceptability as a low-cost&#xD;
      intervention designed to be implemented at clinics providing family planning care. The&#xD;
      intervention is being designed based off of phase 1 of this study, currently in the analysis&#xD;
      phase, which included semi-structured interviews, focus groups, and surveys with a diverse&#xD;
      sample of young women with varying degrees of experience with IUC. The intervention will&#xD;
      consist of brief education about IUC and development of interpersonal skills, including how&#xD;
      to initiate conversations about reproductive health issues in social settings and how to&#xD;
      utilize social media. New IUC users will be recruited as &quot;dissemination agents&quot; to provide&#xD;
      information about the option of IUC to their peers. Sixteen to twenty IUC users will be&#xD;
      recruited from a local family planning clinic to receive the intervention, and we will&#xD;
      conduct 3-month qualitative and quantitative follow-up of these individuals and their social&#xD;
      contacts to assess the feasibility and impact of the intervention on IUC knowledge, attitudes&#xD;
      and practices. We will also conduct a focus group with clinic staff about the feasibility of&#xD;
      implementing the intervention in the clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test of snowball sampling for social network analysis The social contacts will be recruited&#xD;
      via one of two snowball sampling methods: active or passive recruitment. Eight to ten&#xD;
      dissemination agents will be randomized into each recruitment arm. In the passive recruitment&#xD;
      arm, the dissemination agents (IUC users receiving the intervention) will give referral cards&#xD;
      to their social contacts, encouraging them to contact the research team. Dissemination agents&#xD;
      will receive a small &quot;finder's fee&quot; for each friend who contacts the researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the active recruitment approach, dissemination agents will ask their social contacts for&#xD;
      permission to share their contact information with study staff, who will then actively reach&#xD;
      out to the social contacts to ask if they would like to enroll in the study. Dissemination&#xD;
      agents will also receive a finder's fee for each social contact who enrolls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both recruitment arms, social contacts will complete a baseline survey and will be&#xD;
      contacted for follow-up at 3 months to assess the effects of the intervention. We will also&#xD;
      assess which recruitment method is most effective at enrolling members of the dissemination&#xD;
      agents' social network. A randomly selected sub-set of participants will be selected to&#xD;
      complete a more detailed qualitative interview at the end of the intervention. To minimize&#xD;
      any potential Hawthorne effect, social contacts will initially be blinded as to the specific&#xD;
      aims being assessed, and will be debriefed at the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will provide the data necessary to prepare for a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      of this intervention.&#xD;
