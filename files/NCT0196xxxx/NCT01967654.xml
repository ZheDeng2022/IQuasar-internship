  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vietnam has a smoking prevalence that is the second highest among South East Asian countries&#xD;
      (SEACs). With a population of approximately 90 million, Vietnam also has the second largest&#xD;
      total number of adult smokers (over 16 million) in SEA. According to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO), most reductions in mortality from tobacco use in the near future will be&#xD;
      achieved through helping current users quit. Tobacco use treatment, as defined by the U.S.&#xD;
      Preventive Health Service Guideline (Guideline) on Treating Tobacco use and Dependence, is&#xD;
      evidence-based and highly cost-effective. Yet, in the U.S. and globally, adoption of&#xD;
      recommended care is suboptimal. The objective of this proposal is to fill the current&#xD;
      research-to-practice gap by conducting a randomized controlled trial that compares the&#xD;
      effectiveness and cost effectiveness of two practical and highly replicable strategies for&#xD;
      implementing evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of tobacco use in public health&#xD;
      clinics in Vietnam. The proposed implementation strategies draw on evidence-based approaches,&#xD;
      and the WHO's recently released guidelines for implementing Article 14 of the Framework&#xD;
      Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC). The FCTC is an evidence-based treaty that was developed&#xD;
      by the WHO in response to the globalization of the tobacco epidemic. Vietnam ratified the&#xD;
      FCTC in 2004; however, they have not taken steps to implement Article 14 which specifies the&#xD;
      need to integrate best practices for treating tobacco use and dependence into routine&#xD;
      preventive care. The proposed implementation strategies also build on the growing literature&#xD;
      that supports the effectiveness of integrating community health workers as members of the&#xD;
      health care team to improve access to preventive services.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To conduct a formative evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formative evaluation has three components: 1) Key informant interviews with leaders in&#xD;
      the public health sector responsible for developing and implementing policy in Vietnam to&#xD;
      assess contextual factors (e.g. district level policies) that may influence implementation&#xD;
      and dissemination; 2) Focus groups with current smokers to inform adaptations to the current&#xD;
      training curriculum and counseling manual; and 3) baseline study site assessments to assess&#xD;
      organizational readiness to change and current policies and practices to inform necessary&#xD;
      adaptations to the proposed system changes.The investigators will develop semi-structured&#xD;
      interview and focus group guides and adapt survey tools guided by the conceptual model&#xD;
      described above as well as a robust literature on factors that influence implementation and&#xD;
      dissemination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection. 1) Key informant interviews. The investigators will conduct key informant&#xD;
      interviews with at least one senior level staff person from the following stakeholder groups:&#xD;
      a) MOH central level agencies involved in tobacco control such as VINACOSH, and the&#xD;
      Ministries of Education and Training and Science and Technology; b) Executive Directors of&#xD;
      the Vietnam Medical Association and the Vietnam Public Health Association; c) WHO Vietnam; d)&#xD;
      at the provincial level, a representative from the Department of Health and Preventive&#xD;
      Medicine Center; and e) four district health directors in the two target provinces (HaNoi and&#xD;
      Thai Nguyen) for a total of about 16 interviews. The investigators use a semi-structured&#xD;
      interview guide organized by constructs found to influence implementation and dissemination&#xD;
      outcomes.52-56 These include external factors (tobacco control policies, national priorities&#xD;
      for resource allocation and relative priority of tobacco control, relative priority of&#xD;
      smoking cessation) perceived barriers to implementing guideline recommended cessation&#xD;
      services, perceived commitment of leadership in and outside the MOH, perceived challenges to&#xD;
      maintaining and disseminating changes in service delivery at the local and province level.&#xD;
      Recruitment for key informant interviews: Using a purposive sampling approach, ISMS will&#xD;
      leverage their contacts to assist in recruiting stakeholders for the key informant interviews&#xD;
      through email invitations to participate. Research staff will then follow-up by telephone to&#xD;
      enroll stakeholders in the study. The investigators will conduct these interviews. 2) Focus&#xD;
      groups: An experienced facilitator from ISMS will conduct six focus groups (3 in each study&#xD;
      district) with current smokers (6-8 participants, 4 male and 2 female groups). The focus&#xD;
      groups will assess expectations about health benefits of quitting, past cessation history,&#xD;
      including availability, affordability and use of cessation medications, knowledge of&#xD;
      cessation resources, and attitudes towards the proposed intervention. There is a relatively&#xD;
      large database on the knowledge and attitudes about tobacco use among smokers in Vietnam.&#xD;
      Therefore, the groups will focus more on access to treatment, attitudes towards&#xD;
      pharmacotherapy and treatment preferences. Inclusion/exclusion criteria include: current&#xD;
      smoker (smoked in past 7 days), patient of a CHC in one of the two study districts, and age&#xD;
      18 and over. Recruitment for focus groups: the same methods as were used to recruit patients&#xD;
      to the pilot study. Patients will be screened for current tobacco use in the CHCs, asked to&#xD;
      participate if they meet eligibility criteria and given a date and time for the meeting.&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained at the time of the focus group. 3) Baseline study site assessments:&#xD;
      In all enrolled study sites the following will be conducted: a) an assessment of baseline&#xD;
      organizational characteristics. This includes data on setting-level variables shown to&#xD;
      influence the implementation of practice guidelines including number of FTE staff, clinic&#xD;
      volume, policies and systems. A a practice environment checklist will be used to inventory&#xD;
      current policies, workflow, systems (e.g. chart systems) and staff roles and responsibilities&#xD;
      in general, and specifically related to tobacco use treatment. b)Semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      with clinical and administrative key informants (clinical director, 2 CHWs and 3 providers&#xD;
      per site) to supplement the checklist data and to elaborate on potential barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators for tobacco use treatment. c) A provider and CHW survey (tested in the pilot&#xD;
      research and based on a survey from the WHO that was validated in Vietnamese). Surveys will&#xD;
      assess baseline knowledge, attitudes and current practice patterns related to tobacco use&#xD;
      treatment to inform additional modifications in training materials. d) Organizational&#xD;
      readiness to change: provider surveys will include the Change Process Capability&#xD;
      Questionnaire(CPCQ), a validated tool that is applicable to primary care practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM 2: To compare the effectiveness and cost effectiveness of two implementation strategies&#xD;
      to increase adherence to tobacco use treatment guidelines, and AIM 3: To explore&#xD;
      organizational factors hypothesized to influence the relationship between the implementation&#xD;
      strategies and implementation effectiveness. The Aims will be combined for the remainder of&#xD;
      the Approach section because of overlaps in design and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A two arm, randomized trial comparing approach will be used: ARM 1) technical assistance,&#xD;
      training, and clinical reminder system (TTC), and ARM 2) TTC+ referral to a CHW for&#xD;
      additional counseling and follow-up. The investigators will conduct a baseline assessment of&#xD;
      provider adherence to tobacco use treatment by collecting patient exit interviews (PEIs)&#xD;
      (i.e., surveys conducted immediately after the patient visit) from 50 patients per site who&#xD;
      meet eligibility criteria as current smokers. We will then implement the components of ARM 1&#xD;
      and 2. At 12 months post implementation we will conduct PEIs with another 50 smokers per&#xD;
      site. These patients will be asked to consent to follow-up surveys at 3 and 6 months to&#xD;
      assess smoking abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site eligibility and recruitment. The investigators have chosen two provinces to&#xD;
      represent both an urban and rural setting. Thai Nguyen and Hanoi The district we have&#xD;
      selected in Hanoi is representative of those CHCs located in the central part of the city and&#xD;
      the district in Thai Nguyen is representative of the rural CHCs in that province. Site&#xD;
      criteria include having at least one physician, &gt;4 allied health care professional staff, &gt;5&#xD;
      CHWs and a patient population of at least 4000. Using methods for site recruitment used by&#xD;
      ISMS, the Director of the District Health Centers will introduce our study to all CHCs that&#xD;
      fit these criteria through a letter of introduction and follow-up telephone or in person&#xD;
      contacts. Among those expressing interest, we will randomly select 26 CHCs (13 rural and 13&#xD;
      urban). Sites will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention conditions within&#xD;
      urban and rural strata. We will recruit sites in 3 successive waves.&#xD;
