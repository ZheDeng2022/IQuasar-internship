  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body weight excess, from overweight to overt obesity, is associated with adverse health&#xD;
      outcomes. In view of the time-trends of the obesity epidemic and the related cost burden, the&#xD;
      search for effective strategies for weight reduction and long-term maintenance of weight loss&#xD;
      (WL) is at the top of the agenda of public health systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current first-line strategy includes several treatment options and dietary interventions&#xD;
      to be implemented together with an exercise program. Unfortunately, compliance with&#xD;
      intervention in the long-term is difficult. It is not infrequent to observe people following&#xD;
      one diet after another and experiencing multiple failures which, in turn, lead to higher body&#xD;
      weight and adverse consequences on body composition and fat distribution. The higher the&#xD;
      number of attempts, the more difficult the adherence to further interventions. In the&#xD;
      presence of severe (body mass index &gt;40 kg/m2) or complicated obesity, bariatric surgery&#xD;
      could be proposed. This therapeutic option is effective, but is not devoid of complications&#xD;
      and may be irreversible. Obesity-related complications, such as diabetes, hypertension or&#xD;
      sleep apnoea are likely to occur more frequently with increasing body mass index (BMI) and&#xD;
      rapid and considerable WL is mandatory to curtail such risks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this scenario, alternative treatment options are warranted. About 40 years ago, after the&#xD;
      introduction of protein-sparing modified fasting (PSMF) achieved through the use of oral&#xD;
      high-protein foods or liquid formula diets by Blackburn and Bistrian, several studies&#xD;
      evaluated its effectiveness and safety. They showed that responsible and supervised very-low&#xD;
      calorie diets (VLCDs) could be considered safe and appropriate therapy for obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study was to investigate the potential role of a 2-week course of&#xD;
      enteral treatment with a very low-calorie protein-based formula in the management of severe&#xD;
      obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of this treatment option rests on the following considerations: 1) VLCDs appear&#xD;
      to be able to reduce cardiovascular risk rapidly and effectively; 2) VLCDs induce&#xD;
      considerable short and long-term WL; 3) optimal compliance with the intervention, as active&#xD;
      participation of the patient is not required; 4) continuous administration of the&#xD;
      intervention formula by enteral route enables the the maintenance of the body amino acid&#xD;
      pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before being proposed for clinical use, a new WL program should be scientifically evaluated.&#xD;
      Accordingly, in the present study, attention was focused not only on efficacy in terms of&#xD;
      improving the cardiometabolic risk profile, but also on the feasibility and safety of the&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

    <description>A homemade very low-calorie protein-based formula by enteral route (8-French nasogastric tube) for 14 days. The administration was continuous (h-24) by a feeding pump. The formula was made up of a fixed amount of aminoacids and a variable amount of high-quality proteins: 1.2 g/kg (ideal body weight). Other components were: pro-lipolytic substances (coenzyme Q10 and L-carnitine), linseed oil, policosanol, fructo-oligo saccharides, potassium, sodium and magnesium chloride. The intervention included also the daily oral administration of a multivitamin-multimineral supplement, alkalizing substances (calcium carbonate, 1500 mg; magnesium carbonate, 850 mg; potassium bicarbonate, 500 mg; sodium bicarbonate, 1500 mg; potassium citrate, 500 mg) and herbal remedies. All patients were also prescribed treatment with a proton pump inhibitor and ursodeoxycholic acid. A minimum intake of 2 liters/day of unsweetened fluids was recommended (3 litres in case of a history of kidney stones).</description>
