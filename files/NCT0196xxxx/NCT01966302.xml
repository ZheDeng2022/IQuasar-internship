  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to see if Lung LLC's new experimental formulation of the&#xD;
      medicine Beraprost Sodium, called Beraprost Sodium 314d Modified Release (BPS-314d-MR), can&#xD;
      improve the symptoms of pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) in patients. An experimental&#xD;
      drug is one that has not been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for use in&#xD;
      the general public. This research study is for patients who have pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      hypertension (PAH) and have just completed taking part in an earlier research study and&#xD;
      received an older experimental formulation of Beraprost Sodium, called Beraprost Sodium&#xD;
      Modified Release (BPS-MR). That earlier study was being done to see if BPS-MR could improve&#xD;
      their PAH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may also be taking Tyvaso (treprostinil), Tracleer (bosentan), Letairis&#xD;
      (ambrisentan), Adcirca (tadalafil) and/or Viagra or Revatio (sildenafil) to treat their PAH.&#xD;
      The diagnosis of PAH means that the blood pressure in their lungs is higher than normal. The&#xD;
      increased blood pressure in the lungs places a strain on the heart. The strain causes the&#xD;
      heart to pump less blood into the lungs, causing shortness of breath and tiredness. The&#xD;
      strain on the heart weakens the heart muscle making it less able to pump blood, a condition&#xD;
      called heart failure. As heart failure develops, swelling in the feet and abdomen may occur.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      According to Lung LLC, and from my review of summary results contained within the most recent&#xD;
      version of the BPS-314d-MR Investigators' Brochure I concur, BPS-314d- MR has been shown to&#xD;
      have a similar safety and pharmacokinetic profile in healthy volunteers to BPS-MR. It is also&#xD;
      my understanding that at an End of Phase II meeting in April of this year, FDA acknowledged&#xD;
      Lung LLC's intention to continue the development of BPS-314d-MR by conducting a Phase III&#xD;
      pivotal study in PAH patients. This study, BPS-314d-MR-PAH-302 was subsequently initiated&#xD;
      this past June.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In my opinion, and based upon the similarities of the two formulations, it is in the best&#xD;
      interest of our patients to transition their treatment to BPS-314d-MR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung LLC has agreed to supply BPS-314d-MR for the patients.&#xD;
