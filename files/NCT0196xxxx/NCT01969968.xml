  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      I- Goals Because of its exponential prevalence and its co-morbidities, obesity, particularly&#xD;
      in its most massive forms, has become a public health problem. It is likely that this&#xD;
      epidemic be secondary to both genetic and behavioural factors, and also to environmental&#xD;
      factors. Specifically, the &quot;obesogen&quot; and &quot;diabetogen&quot; role of several persistant organic&#xD;
      polluants (POP) known as endocrine disruptors used in farming or industry has recently been&#xD;
      suggested by experimental animal studies and by human epidemiologic studies. Those chemicals&#xD;
      are usually lipophilic, are stored in adipose tissue where they bio-accumulate, and are&#xD;
      released in the blood stream during the lipolysis that occurs in any weight loss. This weight&#xD;
      loss is particularly rapid and important after bariatric surgery, that is proposed as a&#xD;
      treatment for morbid obesity usually leading to an improvement of insulin resistance,&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, and diabetes. However, this improvement is not constant, or is less&#xD;
      important than would be anticipated for the massive weight loss observed. This raises the&#xD;
      question of the importance and of deleterious impact of the blood release of lipophilic POPs&#xD;
      on the evolution of metabolic syndrome and the low grade associated inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective, multicentric study, we propose to analyse the kinetic of the release of&#xD;
      several POPs during rapid and massive weight loss obtained after bariatric surgery. Those&#xD;
      POPs have been chosen for their obesogen or diabetogen properties, reported in vitro or in&#xD;
      vivo, for their lipophilic nature, and their ubiquitous presence in the home environment&#xD;
      and/or into the food chain: bisphenol A (plastics); tributyltin (fungicide, anti-fouling&#xD;
      agent or thermic stabilizant); polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDE, fire retardants);&#xD;
      perchlorated octano√Ød acid and its sulphated compounds (PFOA and PFOS, perfluoroalkyls used&#xD;
      as surfactant, lubrifiants, and usted in wrappings); and organochorinated compounds such as:&#xD;
      PCB153, representing the polychlorinated bisphenyls (electric isolation); hexachlorobenzene&#xD;
      (HBC), and several pesticides: DDE, metabolite of DDT, now banned but with a very long half&#xD;
      life, hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH), heptachlor, nanochlor and chlordane used in agriculture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II- Originality and /or new aspect of the project Though suggested by several experimental&#xD;
      studies, the role of POP in human obesity remains largely unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no or very few papers on the role in humans of the POPs we have selected, but they&#xD;
      are supported by animal experimental studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept of release in the blood stream after weight loss is recent and deserves to be&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III- Reasons for the choice of questions (3 maximum) Interest of the results/method to&#xD;
      improve knowledge on those questions&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the kinetics of release after bariatric surgery of selected polluants stored in&#xD;
           adipose tissue, looking for clinical and/or predictive factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test the hypothesis of a deleterious effect of this release on the expected&#xD;
           improvement of insulin-resistance and on the liver inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the level of contamination of morbidly obese patients, with or without&#xD;
           metabolic syndrome, compared to a control, non obese population, with special attention&#xD;
           to clinical (age, gender, reproductive history, pregnancy, nursing) and biological&#xD;
           parameters (insulin-resistance, inflammation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV- Description of the methods/ Calendar The POPs will be measured in serum, urine (for BPA)&#xD;
      and in adipose tissue (subcutaneous and visceral) by gas chromatography coupled to mass&#xD;
      spectrometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat mass will be estimated when possible by DEXA (if weight&lt;150 kg), or by impedancemetry,&#xD;
      allowing the calculation of an estimated total body burden for each POP (since they are&#xD;
      lipophilic, we will multiply the concentration of each chemical in adipose tissue expressed&#xD;
      in ng/g of fat by the total estimated body mass of fat).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients included will be 250 morbidly obese adults, with or without metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome (3 out of 5 classical criteria), eligible for bariatric surgery (125 from Nice&#xD;
      undergoing gastric bypass, and 125 from Montpellier undergoing sleeve gastrectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concentrations of polluants will be measured at baseline and 3, 6 and 12 month after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, and at 18 months as well for patients who will undergo abdominoplasty&#xD;
      required by their massive weight loss. Baseline concentrations in obese patients will be&#xD;
      compared to those measured in 100 controls, matched for age and gender, with a BMI&lt;25.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulin resistance will be assessed by HOMA-IR, adiponectine and SHBG, inflammation by us&#xD;
      CRP, leptin, interleukin 6, TNF alpha, transaminases, gammaGT, alkalin phosphatase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The redistribution of POPs in serum and adipose tissue, and the estimation of total body&#xD;
      burden will be assessed before and after surgery.&#xD;
