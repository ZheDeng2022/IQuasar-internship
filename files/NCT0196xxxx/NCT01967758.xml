  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study for patients with brain tumors called astrocytic tumors. The study will&#xD;
      enroll patients who have received standard treatment. The study will test a vaccine called&#xD;
      ADU-623. ADU-623 has not been tested in humans before, so the goal of this study is to see if&#xD;
      ADU-623 can be given safely to brain cancer patients and what is the better dose to give&#xD;
      patients among the three doses that planned to be tested. This study will also evaluate the&#xD;
      length of time before patients' cancer worsens and if ADU-623 helps patients to live longer.&#xD;
      The study will also measure the body's immune system response to ADU-623.&#xD;

      This Phase I clinical trial will examine the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of a&#xD;
      novel vaccine approach using a live-attenuated strain of Listeria monocytogenes expressing&#xD;
      EGFRvIII and NY-ESO-1 antigens to induce proliferation of memory and effector T cells with&#xD;
      the overall goal of promoting an immune response against high-grade astrocytic tumors.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective of this trial is to determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)(up to a dose of 1x10^9 cfu IV) and characterize the safety profile of ADU-623 vaccine in patients with recurrent WHO Grade III/IV Astrocytomas. The MTD will be defined as the highest dose at which none or one out of 6 patients experiences a dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) that is possibly or probably related to the vaccine.</description>
