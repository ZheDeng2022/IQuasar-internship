  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The treatment of bipolar disorders is always a challenge in daily practice. Mood stabilizers&#xD;
      are partially effective in the treatment of depressive phase of the illness, although there&#xD;
      are some reports relating to the antidepressant properties of these drugs. Other conventional&#xD;
      methods (pharmacological) and non- conventional treatment are not effective or involve risks&#xD;
      and side effects. Several studies with Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) showed that&#xD;
      magnetic stimulation daily over the left prefrontal cortex may improve the mood of patients.&#xD;
      TMS is a noninvasive method of stimulating the brain. The instrument used nowadays in local&#xD;
      research and application Clinical is a metallic coil formed in figure 8 (coil format 8). This&#xD;
      instrument was capable of stimulating only surface areas of the brain, primarily the cerebral&#xD;
      cortex, at depths of up to 3 inches below the scalp. From this angle, there is clearly a need&#xD;
      for a means of producing magnetic fields which can reach deeper brain areas, such as those&#xD;
      involved in mood disorders. TMS has little, if any effect in these brain areas. To this end,&#xD;
      new coils, calls &quot;H&quot;, that promote the stimulation of deep brain areas were developed in&#xD;
      collaboration with the National Institute of Health (NIH) in the USA. This new coil - H1 that&#xD;
      will be evaluated in this study has been tested for safety in NIH in 2003 by Dr. Abraham&#xD;
      Zangen. Yet there are very few prospective clinical, randomized and controlled trials, on the&#xD;
      effects of early and late in clinical-cognitive condition and safety of TMS with H1 coils in&#xD;
      treating episodes of bipolar depression. The application of EMT with H1 coils can reach&#xD;
      deepest regions of the brain and improve the clinical and cognitive condition of subjects&#xD;
      with episodes of bipolar depression, and may be confirmed as a safe and virtually free of&#xD;
      side effects. By an absence of treatment actually effective for bipolar depression, this&#xD;
      study will show whether there are clinical and cognitive benefits of deep TMS with H1 coil in&#xD;
      patients with bipolar depression.&#xD;

      The present research protocol will evaluate clinical-cognitive and safety effects of H1-Coil&#xD;
      Deep Brain Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation over prefrontal cortex in subjects with bipolar&#xD;
      depression, currently treated with mood stabilizer and/or antipsychotics for stabilization&#xD;
      and sleep regulation. Patients will be clinically evaluated with the Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders 5th Edition (DSM-5) criteria for Bipolar Depressive&#xD;
      Episode. Symptoms intensity will be rated according to The Hamilton Depression Scale (HAMD&#xD;
      -17 items) - main outcome. Patients with scores higher than 18 will be included and the&#xD;
      cognitives functions will be evaluated according with tasks of neuropsychologic battery&#xD;
      chosen. Patients with active neurological or severe disorders (such as cancer, auto-imune and&#xD;
      cardiologic disorders) will be excluded. The present study is a double-blinded, controlled,&#xD;
      randomized trial with 50 patients in bipolar depression episode. The intervention protocol&#xD;
      consist in 20 consecutive daily deep TMS sessions (skipping the weekend). After meeting&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized (computer generated list) to one of the two&#xD;
      intervention groups: 25 patients in Active H1-Coil deep brain rTMS group and Sham H1-Coil&#xD;
      deep brain rTMS group. H1-Coil deep brain rTMS sessions will follow the following steps: the&#xD;
      first day of treatment, patients will be instructed to wear earplugs to minimize the risk of&#xD;
      impaired hearing. Then, the threshold intensity of stimulation motor is determined by&#xD;
      applying pulses only to the motor cortex. The stimulation threshold is determined pro&#xD;
      gradually increase the stimulation intensity every 5 seconds. The stimulation threshold is&#xD;
      defined as stimulation of lesser intensity that can evoked motor potential with at least 50Î¼V&#xD;
      amplitude of at least 5 tentativas.A coil is positioned to 5 centimeters below the hot spot&#xD;
      (in the prefrontal area) intensity - 120% of the threshold engine. Each session will receive&#xD;
      55 groups of stimuli, duration - 2/2 , frequency - 18 Hz , area - left prefrontal , intervals&#xD;
      - 20 seconds . Soon, 1,980 pulses of magnetic stimulation will be administered every day (per&#xD;
      session), totaling 39,600 pulses throughout treatment. Patients will be clinically assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, weekly during the four weeks of treatment and for four weeks after completion of&#xD;
      treatment ending in 8 weeks. Main outcome will be based on HAMD-17 items at a endpoint of&#xD;
      4-weeks and follow up 4-weeks, with secondary outcomes assessing Young Mania Rating Scale (11&#xD;
      items) at 8 weeks. Other evaluation scales include, Hamilton Anxiety Scale, Global Assessment&#xD;
      Scale and Clinical Global Impression at 8 weeks. The cognitive assessment will be performed&#xD;
      with a neuropsychologic battery tests at baseline, endpoint of 4-weeks and endpoint of&#xD;
      8-weeks with a trained neuropsychologist. Also a Safety Deep rTMS Scale, adverse effects&#xD;
      scales and clinical evaluation with a trained physician.&#xD;
