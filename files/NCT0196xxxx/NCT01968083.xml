  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Human respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is a common cause of respiratory illness in infants&#xD;
      and children. This study will evaluate the safety and immune response to an RSV vaccine in&#xD;
      healthy RSV-naïve children.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      RSV is the most common viral cause of serious acute lower respiratory illness (LRI) in&#xD;
      infants and children under 5 years of age around the world. RSV illness can range from mild&#xD;
      upper respiratory tract illness (URI) to severe LRI, including bronchiolitis and pneumonia.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of an RSV vaccine in healthy RSV-naïve&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At study entry, participants will undergo a medical history review, physical examination,&#xD;
      blood collection, and a nasal wash. Participants will be randomly assigned to receive the RSV&#xD;
      vaccine or placebo at a 2:1 ratio, to be administered as nose drops. Participants will be&#xD;
      actively monitored for 28 days following administration of vaccine or placebo; monitoring&#xD;
      will include medical history reviews, clinical assessments, and at some visits, nasal washes.&#xD;
      On the days when no study visit is scheduled, study researchers will contact participants'&#xD;
      parents or guardians for medical follow-up. At a study visit on Day 56, participants will&#xD;
      undergo a medical history review, blood collection, and a nasal wash procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From November through March following each participant's study participation, parents or&#xD;
      guardians will report respiratory and/or febrile illnesses on a weekly basis via telephone&#xD;
      calls to study researchers. Participants may have additional study visits that may include&#xD;
      blood collection and/or nasal wash procedures during this follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol is a companion study to CIR 285; a study being conducted by the Center for&#xD;
      Immunization Research (CIR, Johns Hopkins, Baltimore), and the Laboratory of Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases (NIAID, Bethesda). The protocols have identical primary and secondary objectives;&#xD;
      immunization schedules; evaluation assays and schedules; safety monitoring and reporting. The&#xD;
      protocols will vary slightly in site selection requirements, eligibility requirements and&#xD;
      site monitoring. These are all operational issues modified to account for the IMPAACT sites'&#xD;
      operations and infrastructure.&#xD;
