      Our hypothesis is that quantitative 3D analysis of cardiac CT images obtained during&#xD;
      vasodilator stress can accurately identify patients presenting at the emergency department&#xD;
      with acute chest pain due to underlying hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis, aid in&#xD;
      the identification of individuals most likely to benefit from revascularization, and thus&#xD;
      improve the ability to predict patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goals are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to test the above hypothesis by comparing stress MDCT perfusion data with invasive&#xD;
           fractional flow reserve (FFR) data in patients with significant stenosis who undergo&#xD;
           ICA;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the added value of MDCT perfusion as an adjunct to CTCA for predicting&#xD;
           patient outcomes.&#xD;

      Background. In the United States, more than 8 million patients require emergency department&#xD;
      evaluation for acute chest pain every year. The estimated cost for these evaluations is &gt; $10&#xD;
      billion and the loss of economic productivity is likely far greater. Multidetector computed&#xD;
      tomography (MDCT) is a popular alternative to diagnostic invasive coronary angiography (ICA)&#xD;
      (Deetjen, et al. 2007, Schroeder, et al. 2008, de Roos 2010) and is gaining wide clinical&#xD;
      acceptance for its ability to rule out significant coronary artery disease (CAD) (Hulten,&#xD;
      Bittencourt, Ghoshhajra and Blankstein 2012). However, in patients with acute chest pain,&#xD;
      abnormal CT coronary angiography (CTCA) findings frequently result in additional nuclear&#xD;
      myocardial perfusion imaging (MPI) to determine the hemodynamic significance of coronary&#xD;
      stenosis (Garcia, Lessick and Hoffmann 2006, Deetjen, et al. 2007, Miller, et al. 2008,&#xD;
      Schroeder, et al. 2008, de Roos 2010). This is because the presence and extent of myocardial&#xD;
      ischemia is more important than the severity of a coronary stenosis for identifying patients&#xD;
      who would benefit from coronary revascularization. Accordingly, with the growing interest in&#xD;
      simultaneous evaluation of coronary anatomy and the hemodynamic significance of CAD in a&#xD;
      single test, studies have focused on the potential of MDCT to assess myocardial perfusion&#xD;
      (Techasith and Cury 2011). One hurdle this approach needs to overcome is that it relies on&#xD;
      visual assessment of manually selected 2D slices, rather than 3D analysis of the entire&#xD;
      myocardium, and requires manual adjustment of contrast windows, both carrying the risk of&#xD;
      missing subendocardial perfusion defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior data and hypothesis. To overcome these limitations, we recently developed a technique&#xD;
      for quantitative 3D analysis of myocardial perfusion, which uses the distribution of x-ray&#xD;
      attenuation to calculate for each myocardial segment an index of severity and extent of&#xD;
      perfusion abnormality (Kachenoura, et al. 2010). Having confirmed the ability of this&#xD;
      analysis to detect regadenoson-induced perfusion abnormalities in consecutive patients&#xD;
      referred for CTCA (Mor-Avi, et al. 2012), we propose a new study aimed at determining the&#xD;
      value of this methodology in patients presenting in the emergency department with acute chest&#xD;
      pain. We selected this cohort to further validate CT perfusion analysis and to determine&#xD;
      whether it provides additive utility over CTCA alone, because these patients are increasingly&#xD;
      referred by emergency departments for CTCA in large numbers, instead of nuclear vasodilator&#xD;
      stress testing, thus losing valuable physiologic information. Because our perfusion index was&#xD;
      specifically designed to take into account the fact that stress-induced perfusion defects are&#xD;
      subendocardial, we hypothesize that our quantitative 3D analysis can accurately identify&#xD;
      patients presenting at the emergency department with acute chest pain due to underlying&#xD;
      hemodynamically significant coronary stenosis, aid in the identification of individuals most&#xD;
      likely to benefit from revascularization, and thus improve the ability to predict patient&#xD;
      outcomes. Indeed, our previous study showed that with regadenoson, our perfusion index is 2-3&#xD;
      times higher in myocardial segments supplied by arteries with significant stenosis (Patel, et&#xD;
      al. 2011), and thus improves the diagnosis of hemodynamically significant CAD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims. This study was designed to achieve the following goals: (1) to test the above&#xD;
      hypothesis by comparing stress MDCT perfusion data with invasive fractional flow reserve&#xD;
      (FFR) data in patients with significant stenosis who undergo ICA; and (2) to determine the&#xD;
      added value of MDCT perfusion as an adjunct to CTCA for predicting patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design. In this study, MDCT imaging will be performed during regadenoson stress in&#xD;
      approximately 150 consecutive patients with chest pain referred for CTCA, who agree to&#xD;
      undergo additional MDCT imaging during vasodilator stress. Patients with contraindications to&#xD;
      CTCA, including known allergies to iodine, renal dysfunction (creatinine &gt;1.6 mg/dL),&#xD;
      inability to perform a 10 sec breath-hold, and contraindications to beta-blockers or&#xD;
      regadenoson, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, advanced heart block or systolic&#xD;
      blood pressure &lt;90 mmHg, will be excluded from the study. In addition, patients with a&#xD;
      history of cardiothoracic surgery or pacemaker or coronary stent implantation will be&#xD;
      excluded. Myocardial perfusion will be assessed using quantitative volumetric analysis, but&#xD;
      will not be reported to the referring physician in order to avoid referral bias. In each&#xD;
      patient, we will collect the following information at the time of enrollment: age, gender,&#xD;
      height, weight, blood pressure, tobacco use, history of heart disease, hypertension, stroke&#xD;
      and diabetes. In addition, a blood sample will be obtained to allow analysis of lipids and&#xD;
      cardiac enzymes. In a subgroup of patients who also undergo ICA, MDCT perfusion will be&#xD;
      compared with the ICA findings, including the degree of stenosis and FFR. Enrollment will be&#xD;
      stopped when 30 patients with ICA data are enrolled (based on power analysis). All study&#xD;
      patients will be followed up to determine the predictive value of MDCT perfusion for major&#xD;
      cardiovascular events at 1 moth and 1 year after presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDCT imaging protocol. Beta-blocker metoprolol will be given orally (50 mg, 1 hr prior to&#xD;
      imaging) and/or intravenously (5 to 15 mg immediately prior to imaging), as necessary to&#xD;
      achieve a target heart rate of &lt;70 bpm. Images will be acquired during suspended respiration&#xD;
      (256-channel iCT scanner, Philips). Initially, CTCA will be performed at rest according to&#xD;
      the standard clinical protocol. Then, regadenoson (Lexiscan, Astellas) will be administered&#xD;
      (0.4mg, i.v. bolus) at least 15 minutes later to ensure contrast clearance. An additional set&#xD;
      of images will be acquired 1 minute after the administration of regadenoson to ensure imaging&#xD;
      during peak vasodilator effect. Stress images will be acquired following injection of 50 ml&#xD;
      of iodinated contrast at a rate of 4 ml/sec, using prospective gating, in order to minimize&#xD;
      radiation exposure, resulting in an average of 2 mSv for the additional stress scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MDCT image analysis. Myocardial perfusion will be analyzed both at rest and during&#xD;
      vasodilator stress. Following manual initialization of endo- and epicardial boundaries in 5&#xD;
      to 6 slices, the endo- and epicardial 3D surfaces will be automatically estimated using the&#xD;
      level-set technique (Corsi, et al. 2005). The 3D region of interest confined between the&#xD;
      endocardial and epicardial surfaces will be identified as LV myocardium and divided into 3D&#xD;
      wedge-shaped myocardial segments, according to standard AHA segmentation (Cerqueira, et al.&#xD;
      2002): 6 basal, 6 mid-ventricular, and 4 apical segments. For each myocardial segment, mean&#xD;
      x-ray attenuation value will be automatically measured in Hounsfeld units (HU). Then x-ray&#xD;
      attenuation in all LV slices from base to apex will be used as described previously&#xD;
      (Kachenoura, et al. 2010) to generate a bull's eye display of myocardial attenuation&#xD;
      normalized by mean LV cavity attenuation, resembling MPI bull's eyes. Unlike our previous&#xD;
      study of fixed perfusion defects (Kachenoura, et al. 2010), in which the bull's eyes&#xD;
      displayed transmural attenuation, in this study we will also create bull's eyes of&#xD;
      subendocardial attenuation to optimize the visualization of stress-induced subendocardial&#xD;
      perfusion defects. In addition to the bull's eye displays of subendocardial attenuation, this&#xD;
      information will be mapped onto the reconstructed 3D-rendered endocardial surface to&#xD;
      facilitate the appreciation of the location and extent of perfusion abnormality. This 3D&#xD;
      display allows manually rotating the model to allow visualization from any angle, and&#xD;
      provides a more realistic view of the hypoenhanced area with less distortion than the bull's&#xD;
      eyes. Finally, for each myocardial segment, a quantitative index of extent and severity of&#xD;
      perfusion abnormality, Qh, will be calculated as a mathematical product of the number of&#xD;
      voxels with low attenuation in percent of the total volume of the segment, reflecting the&#xD;
      extent of the defect, and the difference between the attenuation in these voxels and the&#xD;
      previously determined normal attenuation in the same anatomic location, reflecting the&#xD;
      severity of the defect (Kachenoura, et al. 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective detection of perfusion abnormalities. To allow objective detection of perfusion&#xD;
      abnormalities, data collected in our earlier pilot study were used to determine the&#xD;
      abnormality cutoff values for perfusion index Qh. Myocardial segments were divided into two&#xD;
      groups according to CTCA findings: segments supplied by coronary arteries with stenosis&#xD;
      located proximally to the specific segment and causing &gt;50% luminal narrowing on CTCA, and&#xD;
      segments supplied by arteries without significant stenosis or with stenosis located distally&#xD;
      to the segment. Receiver operator curve (ROC) analysis was used to determine optimal&#xD;
      abnormality thresholds for index Qh for both rest and stress. We will use these thresholds in&#xD;
      the planned prospective study to objectively classify segmental myocardial perfusion as&#xD;
      normal or abnormal. Segments with Qh above the corresponding threshold will be considered&#xD;
      abnormal. A territory of an individual coronary artery will be considered abnormal when the&#xD;
      perfusion index is abnormal in at least one segment. For the patient-by-patient analysis,&#xD;
      abnormal perfusion will be diagnosed when at least one territory is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-technique comparisons. In order to allow comparisons between MDCT perfusion and ICA&#xD;
      findings, coronary anatomy depicted on each patient's MDCT volume rendering of the heart will&#xD;
      be used to determine the perfusion territory of each artery and its major branches, i.e. to&#xD;
      assign each myocardial segment to the territory of a specific coronary artery. This will&#xD;
      allow us to predict normal or abnormal perfusion in each segment based on the ICA&#xD;
      determinations of the presence, location and severity of stenosis. Significant stenosis will&#xD;
      be defined by a 50% and separately 70% decrease in luminal cross-sectional area. Comparisons&#xD;
      with ICA will be performed for perfusion index Qh by itself, and also as an adjunct to CTCA&#xD;
      findings, i.e. percent luminal narrowing and FFR. All inter-technique comparisons will be&#xD;
      performed on a segment-by-segment, vascular territory and patient-by-patient basis.&#xD;
      Inter-technique agreement will be assessed by calculating sensitivity, specificity, positive&#xD;
      and negative predictive values (PPV, NPV) and overall accuracy against the respective&#xD;
      reference standard. The accuracy of MDCT perfusion combined with CTCA findings will be&#xD;
      compared with that of CTCA alone to determine the added clinical value of MDCT perfusion&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient follow-up. Patients enrolled in the study will be followed up for a minimum of 1 year&#xD;
      from the stress test for major adverse cardiovascular events, including coronary&#xD;
      revascularization, hospitalization for unstable angina, myocardial infarction or death. This&#xD;
      information will be obtained from the patients' medical records, Social Security Death Index,&#xD;
      and by phone calls to the patients' homes. The collected follow-up data will be used to&#xD;
      determine the prevalence of adverse events in patients with coronary stenosis &gt;50% and&#xD;
      abnormal perfusion, which will be compared to the remaining patients (chi-square test). The&#xD;
      follow-up data will also be used to study the ability of regadenoson-induced perfusion&#xD;
      abnormalities detected on MDCT images to predict event-free survival. This will be achieved&#xD;
      by univariate logistic regression analysis, followed by multivariate regression for variables&#xD;
      found to predict outcomes by the univariate regression. The predictive value of the&#xD;
      combination of stenosis on CTCA with perfusion defects will be compared with that of the&#xD;
      conventional markers, such as percent coronary luminal narrowing on CTCA alone, cardiac&#xD;
      enzymes, and TIMI risk score. Finally, we will determine whether the combination of these&#xD;
      conventional markers with the MDCT-derived perfusion data would predict patient outcomes&#xD;
      better than either one of them alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anticipated results. We anticipate that perfusion abnormalities detected on MDCT images will&#xD;
      correlate with the findings of ICA, and when added to CTCA findings, will improve the&#xD;
      accuracy of MDCT evaluation of CAD compared to these reference standards. In addition, we&#xD;
      anticipate that when added to the conventional markers, such as cardiac enzymes and TIMI risk&#xD;
      score, vasodilator stress induced MDCT perfusion abnormalities will predict adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular events better than these traditional indices alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Innovation and significance. To our knowledge, this will be the first study to validate&#xD;
      against ICA reference quantitative 3D evaluation of myocardial perfusion from MDCT images&#xD;
      obtained during vasodilator stress in patients referred for CTCA evaluation of acute chest&#xD;
      pain. These patients are increasingly referred for CTCA in large numbers, instead of nuclear&#xD;
      vasodilator stress testing, thus losing valuable physiologic information. Because the&#xD;
      addition of stress perfusion will allow elucidating the impact of coronary lesions in the&#xD;
      same test, such addition promises to improve the diagnostic performance of cardiac CT in the&#xD;
      evaluation of acute chest pain. This methodology may prove as a single-stop alternative to&#xD;
      costly serial testing. Moreover, if this comprehensive approach is proven to better predict&#xD;
      patient outcomes compared to current clinical algorithms, it may become a new tool for risk&#xD;
      stratification and planning individual patient's treatment. We anticipate that the results of&#xD;
      our study will support the use of this methodology in every patient with chest pain referred&#xD;
      for CTCA, similar to the routine use of vasodilator stress with MPI.&#xD;

    <reported_events>
      <time_frame>Adverse effects of the drug (regadenoson) were monitored over 2 hours following administration. The drug is short-acting and is cleared within an even shorter time frame. In contrast, patient outcomes, which are not related to the above drug but to the existing disease, were collected over a follow-up period of at least 1 year (mean 36±25 months). These included all-cause mortality, myocardial infarction or coronary revascularization.</time_frame>
      <desc>Over the above follow-up period, there were adverse outcomes related to the disease (N=7), not to the drug. This was not a drug study aimed at evaluating the safety of regadenoson, but rather the feasibility and efficacy of a new diagnostic techniques, which included the relationship between its findings and outcomes.</desc>
