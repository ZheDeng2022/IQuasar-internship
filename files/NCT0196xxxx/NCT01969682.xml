    <textblock>
      This is an open-label multicenter, study to assess the pharmacokinetic interaction of&#xD;
      rifampin with ABT-199 in up to 12 subjects with relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's&#xD;
      lymphoma.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1 study designed to assess how the body processes the study drug ABT-199 when&#xD;
      taken alone and in combination with rifampin and to assess the safety of ABT-199 in&#xD;
      combination with rifampin. Subjects may enroll in a separate extension study to continue&#xD;
      receiving ABT-199 after completion of this study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have relapsed or refractory non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have histologically documented diagnosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma as&#xD;
             defined by a B-cell neoplasm in the World Health Organization (WHO) classification&#xD;
             scheme except as noted in the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance score of 0 to 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject must have adequate bone marrow (independent of growth factor support per local&#xD;
             laboratory reference range), coagulation, renal and hepatic function:&#xD;

               -  Hemoglobin greater than or equal to 9.0 g/dL (unless anemia is clearly due to&#xD;
                  underlying disease; entry hemoglobin must be independent of transfusion within 14&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  If cytopenias are present, no evidence of myelodysplastic syndrome or hypoplastic&#xD;
                  bone marrow;&#xD;

                  equal to 3.0 × ULN of institution's normal range;&#xD;
&#xD;

                  monitor.&#xD;

             (MCL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject is receiving combination anti-retroviral therapy for HIV (due to potential&#xD;
             drug-drug interactions between anti-retroviral medications and ABT-199, as well as&#xD;
             anticipated ABT-199 mechanism based lymphopenia that may potentially increase the risk&#xD;
             of opportunistic infections).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has hypersensitivity to any of the rifamycins.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a cardiovascular disability status of New York Heart Association Class&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 2. Class 2 is defined as cardiac disease in which patients&#xD;
             are comfortable at rest but ordinary physical activity results in fatigue,&#xD;
             palpitations, dyspnea or anginal pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has a significant history of renal, neurologic, psychiatric, endocrinologic,&#xD;
             metabolic, immunologic, cardiovascular, or hepatic disease within the past 6 months&#xD;
             that in the opinion of the investigator would adversely affect his/her participating&#xD;
             in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject has malabsorption syndrome or other condition which precludes enteral route of&#xD;
