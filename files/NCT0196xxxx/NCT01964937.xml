  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, and immune response to five different&#xD;
      combinations of three HIV vaccines-a DNA vaccine (DNA-HIV-PT123), a NYVAC vaccine&#xD;
      (NYVAC-HIV-PT1 and NYVAC-HIV-PT4 injections), and the AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine-in healthy,&#xD;
      HIV-uninfected adult participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 180 healthy, HIV-uninfected participants aged 18 to 50 years. The&#xD;
      participants will be randomly assigned to one of five groups. All participants will receive&#xD;
      injections according to their assigned group schedule at study entry (Month 0) and Months 1,&#xD;
      3, and 6. The immune response of different prime and boost vaccine strategies will be tested&#xD;
      in Groups 1 through 4, and the immune response of the co-administration of the DNA and&#xD;
      AIDSVAX® B/E vaccine will be tested in Group 5. Group 1 participants will receive AIDSVAX®&#xD;
      B/E as a prime followed by NYVAC as a boost; Group 2 participants will receive NYVAC as a&#xD;
      prime followed by an AIDSVAX® B/E boost; Group 3 participants will receive AIDSVAX® B/E as a&#xD;
      prime followed by a DNA boost; Group 4 participants will receive a DNA prime followed by an&#xD;
      AIDSVAX® B/E boost; and Group 5 participants will receive both the DNA and AIDSVAX® B/E&#xD;
      vaccines at each of the 4 vaccination visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration will be approximately 42 months and will involve 12 months of scheduled&#xD;
      clinic visits at screening, study entry [Month 0], and Months 0.5, 1, 1.5, 3, 3.5, 6, 6.5, 9,&#xD;
      and 12) followed by annual health contacts via e-mail or phone to a total of 3 years&#xD;
      following initial study injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study visits will include a physical exam, HIV risk reduction counseling, and an&#xD;
      interview and/or questionnaire. Select study visits will include blood collection, urine&#xD;
      collection, an electrocardiogram (ECG), and a pregnancy test for participants who were born&#xD;
      female. For participants in Groups 1 and 2, select study visits will also include an&#xD;
      assessment of cardiac symptoms. Participants will remain in the clinic for 30 minutes after&#xD;
      receiving the vaccines for observation and monitoring. For 7 days after receiving the&#xD;
      vaccines, participants will record their symptoms and report them to study researchers.&#xD;
