        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Written informed consent from participant or their legal representative.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with acquired hemophilia with autoimmune inhibitors to human factor VIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a serious bleeding episode, as documented by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to follow all instructions and attend all study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants taking anti-thrombotics may be included depending on the time elapsed&#xD;
             since taking such medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy of at least 90 days prior to the onset of the bleeding episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hemodynamically unstable after blood transfusion, fluid resuscitation and&#xD;
             pharmacologic or volume replacement pressor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an established reason for bleeding that is not correctable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Bleeding episode assessed likely to resolve on its own if left untreated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anti-OBI-1 inhibitor that exceeds 20 BU (prospectively or retrospectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subsequent bleeding episode at the site of the initial qualifying bleeding episode&#xD;
             within 2 weeks following the final OBI-1 dose for the initial qualifying bleeding&#xD;
             episode, or subsequent bleeding episode at a different site than the initial&#xD;
             qualifying bleeding episode within 1 week following the final OBI-1 dose for the&#xD;
             initial qualifying bleeding episode will not be considered &quot;new&quot; qualifying bleeding&#xD;
             episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior history of bleeding disorder other than acquired hemophilia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known major sensitivity (anaphylactoid reactions) to pig or hamster products.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of hemophilia medication within 3 to 6 (depending on medication) hours prior to&#xD;
             OBI-1 administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in any other clinical study within 30 days of the first OBI 1 treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anticipated need for treatment or device during the study that may interfere with the&#xD;
             evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Abnormal baseline findings&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability or unwillingness to comply with the study design, protocol requirements, or&#xD;
             the follow-up procedures.&#xD;
