  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to establish efficacy and safety of Normia® probiotic, used as an&#xD;
      add-on therapy in treatment of H. Pylori infection with the standard triple therapy approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective in the study is determination of efficacy of Normia® probiotic as a&#xD;
      supportive therapy in achieving a higher percentage of eradication of H. Pylori.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to assess:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety profile of Normia® probiotic in everyday use, e.g. reduction in number of&#xD;
           side-effects and better compliance to the eradication therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety and efficacy of Normia® probiotic in different demographic subgroups&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gastroenterologists and general practitioners have increasingly more possibilities of&#xD;
      prescribing probiotic preparations as the only or (more often) adjuvant therapy in certain&#xD;
      indications. A significant step forward was made in the current report of the European&#xD;
      Helicobacter Study Group ,which states that &quot;Certain probiotics and prebiotics show promising&#xD;
      results as an adjuvant treatment in reducing side effects&quot;. At this stage,probiotics are&#xD;
      classified as Grade D recommendation. That is precisely why the investigators believe that&#xD;
      clinical studies are necessary in order for such effects to be objectively proven in a&#xD;
      clinical setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators decided to conduct a clinical trial based on a clearly defined and&#xD;
      sufficiently frequent indication,with a preparation of known probiotic composition that is&#xD;
      easily available on the market, and in a real setting where such approach is bound to show&#xD;
      both advantages and disadvantages.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of eradication of H.Pylori infection with Normia® probiotic as a additional therapy to standard triple therapy regimen</measure>
    <time_frame>40-44 days</time_frame>
    <description>Duration of participation in the study will depend on the duration of therapy prescribed by the attending physician. The exact type of the basic (triple) therapy prescribed to each subject is at the discretion of the physician.&#xD;
Assuming standard therapy regimes for this indication, the shortest possible participation in the study will be as follows:&#xD;
7 days of initial triple therapy, followed by&#xD;
21 days of PPI therapy only, followed by&#xD;
14 days +/- 2 days to the follow up visit. Therefore, study participation will take between 40 and 44 days.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Reducing the number of adverse events for H. pylori eradication triple therapy using Normia® probiotic as a supportive therapy</measure>
    <time_frame>40-44 days</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects will receive therapy considered to be a &quot;golden standard&quot; for this indication (triple therapy eradication protocol). Subjects receiving Placebo will be receiving standard triple therapy as well.</description>
