      This pilot study will adapt and test the feasibility and estimate the effect size parameters&#xD;
      of Kazakhstani Family Together (KFT), a family-based multi-media intervention designed to&#xD;
      reduce sexual and drug-related risks for HIV infection among at-risk 14-17 year old females&#xD;
      and males living in communities highly affected by heroin trade and use in Almaty,&#xD;
      Kazakhstan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to adapt an evidence-based HIV and substance use prevention&#xD;
      intervention for most at-risk adolescents and their caregivers (parents or other adult family&#xD;
      members) from drug-risk communities in Kazakhstan. Located on major drug trafficking routes&#xD;
      (between Afghanistan, the world's largest opium producer, and Russia), Central Asia and&#xD;
      Kazakhstan, in particular, face one of the fastest growing rates of HIV infection in the&#xD;
      world disproportionately affecting young people ages 15-29. Youth exposed to drugs at home&#xD;
      and in the community are particularly at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The country's HIV prevention efforts for youth are limited to a knowledge-based approach,&#xD;
      which does not equip at-risk youth with skills required to deal with situations of risk&#xD;
      exposure. Parents or other caregivers, who represent a significant protective force in a&#xD;
      family-oriented culture of Central Asia, are largely excluded from youth prevention efforts&#xD;
      in Kazakhstan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KFT is a family-based multi-media intervention designed to reduce sexual and drug-related&#xD;
      risks for HIV infection among at-risk adolescents. To address the dual risk of HIV and&#xD;
      substance use, the proposed intervention combines empirically tested skills-based and family&#xD;
      involvement approaches and utilizes multi-media computer technology to develop an engaging&#xD;
      and potentially cost-effective tool with high fidelity and easy scalability. During each of&#xD;
      the sessions, youth and caregivers will participate in interactive computer activities to&#xD;
      learn skills and have conversations focused on risky behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the development stage, the US and Kazakhstani investigative team will conduct&#xD;
      formative research and will work closely with the local Community Collaborative Board to&#xD;
      adapt the intervention to the cultural context of at-risk families in Kazakhstan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, the KFT intervention will be tested in a pilot Randomized Controlled Trial with 248&#xD;
      adolescents and 248 of their caregivers. Intervention arm adolescent-caregiver pairs will&#xD;
      receive three 45-minute interactive multi-media sessions with avatars customized to&#xD;
      participants' gender that will focus on risk reduction self-efficacy, resistance to peer&#xD;
      pressure, and caregiver-adolescent communication, support and monitoring. Adolescents from&#xD;
      both intervention and control arms will receive the usual care services available for at-risk&#xD;
      youth, which includes health education sessions on HIV and drug use delivered by peer&#xD;
      educators and outreach workers.&#xD;

Through the multimedia tool, participants will confront a series of sexual risks and substance use related situations and will practice their listening, empathy, assertiveness, refusal, and other interpersonal skills. Each caregiver-youth pair will work jointly and engage in discussions, exercises, and behavioral rehearsal as directed by the program.</description>

    <description>Adolescents from both study arms will receive the usual care, a health education program about how to prevent drug use and HIV/STIs (sexually transmitted infections). The health education curriculum is delivered in a group format by trained peer educators and outreach workers. The curriculum consists of three 45-minute sessions that include lectures and interactive quizzes about drugs and HIV. These three sessions include information on the following topics:&#xD;
Facts and Myth about HIV. HIV/STIs modes of transmission;&#xD;
Prevention of HIV. Abstinence and Safe Sex. Attitudes and values about sexuality, sexual risk behaviors, and condom use;&#xD;
Knowledge, attitudes and beliefs about drinking and drug use. Risks and consequences of drug use.</description>
