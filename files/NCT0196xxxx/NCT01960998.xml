  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Many men develop urine leakage after prostate cancer surgery. Usually it is temporary, but&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle training and exercise (including urine control strategies) have been&#xD;
      shown to reduce the time to regaining urine control. This study tests an evidence-based,&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to telehealth format and pilot&#xD;
      tested in a VA-funded pilot/developmental trial. Training is begun 1-4 weeks before surgery&#xD;
      and continued 6 months after surgery. Content is accessed on a secure website in daily&#xD;
      10-minute sessions which transition to weekly sessions for post-operative months 3-6. In the&#xD;
      investigators' pilot study, Veterans reported that they appreciated receiving the training in&#xD;
      the privacy of their homes, enjoyed the interactive style of the learning experience, and&#xD;
      felt better prepared to deal with urine leakage and empowered with new knowledge and skills&#xD;
      to help themselves. Content for both control and treatment groups includes general&#xD;
      information about prostate cancer; perioperative care; wetness, odor and skin care&#xD;
      management. The treatment group will ALSO receive pelvic floor muscle training and bladder&#xD;
      control strategies. Outcomes are measured with brief validated questions administered by the&#xD;
      telehealth platform, and again at 9 and 12 months by mailed questionnaire or the telehealth&#xD;
      platform.&#xD;

      Many men develop urine leakage after radical prostatectomy. Usually it is temporary, but&#xD;
      pelvic floor muscle training including bladder control strategies has been shown to reduce&#xD;
      the severity of incontinence and reduce the time to regaining continence. This study will&#xD;
      test an evidence-based pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to&#xD;
      telehealth format and pilot tested in a VA-funded pilot/developmental trial. Training is&#xD;
      begun 1-4 weeks before surgery and continued 6 months after surgery. Content is accessed on a&#xD;
      secure website in daily 10-minute sessions which transition to weekly sessions for&#xD;
      post-operative months 3-6. In the investigators' pilot study, Veterans reported that they&#xD;
      appreciated receiving the training in the privacy of their homes, enjoyed the interactive&#xD;
      style of the learning experience, and felt better prepared to deal with urine leakage and&#xD;
      empowered with new knowledge and skills to help themselves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomized, controlled trial of the telehealth-delivered, evidence-based,&#xD;
      intervention developed in the pilot/developmental study. Participants will be randomized 1:1&#xD;
      to treatment or to a control group. Content for both control and treatment groups includes&#xD;
      general information about prostate cancer; perioperative care; wetness, odor and skin care&#xD;
      management. The treatment group will ALSO receive pelvic floor muscle training and bladder&#xD;
      control strategies. Outcomes are measured with brief validated questions administered by the&#xD;
      telehealth platform, and again at 9 and 12 months by mailed questionnaire or the telehealth&#xD;

    <measure>Time to Continence</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Time to continence was based on the time point at which participants reported no urinary incontinence on the International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF). ICIQ-UI SF is one of a series of ICI questionnaires that have been meticulously developed and tested. The ICIQ-UI SF is a brief (4 items), reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95), questionnaire that quantifies both symptom burden and impact of incontinence and has been validated in men and women. It was administered weekly during the 6 months after surgery. Scores range from 0-21; higher scores indicate worse condition.</description>

          <description>The Gleason score is used to describe prostate cancer cells based on pathologist examination of a biopsy sample. The cells are graded on a scale of 1 to 5, with Grade 1 cells resembling normal prostate tissue. Gleason scores usually range from 6 to 10. A Gleason score of 6 is low grade, 7 is intermediate grade, and 8 to 10 is high grade cancer.</description>

        <title>Time to Continence</title>
        <description>Time to continence was based on the time point at which participants reported no urinary incontinence on the International Consultation on Incontinence (ICI) Questionnaire-Urinary Incontinence Short Form (ICIQ-UI SF). ICIQ-UI SF is one of a series of ICI questionnaires that have been meticulously developed and tested. The ICIQ-UI SF is a brief (4 items), reliable (Cronbach's alpha = 0.95), questionnaire that quantifies both symptom burden and impact of incontinence and has been validated in men and women. It was administered weekly during the 6 months after surgery. Scores range from 0-21; higher scores indicate worse condition.</description>

Across 10 imputations, the mean EPIC-UI score in the no telehealth group at 6 months was 63.5 (standard deviation 24.1) and in the telehealth group was 63.9 (SD 22.1). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was performed with each of the 10 imputations, adjusting for baseline EPIC-UI score, and p values were combined using the Rubin-Licht method.</other_analysis_desc>

Multiple imputation was performed to account for missing data, using the Multiple Imputation via Chained Equations (MICE) package in R. Across 10 imputations, the mean frequencies for the no telehealth group at 6 months were 51.0% (Completely Satisfied), 40.2% (Somewhat Satisfied), and 8.7% (Not at All Satisfied) and in the telehealth group were 34.8%, 59.9%, and 5.3%, respectively (frequencies to not add to exactly 100% due to rounding). Chi-squared analysis with continuity correction was used to determine if there were differences in the observed frequencies between groups (telehealth versus no telehealth) across the 3 levels of the Patient Satisfaction question relative to the expected frequencies with each of the imputations, and p values were combined using the Enders (2001) method.</other_analysis_desc>

            <other_analysis_desc>Frequencies for the telehealth and no telehealth groups on the Global Perception of Improvement (GPI) question are presented above. Multiple imputation was performed to account for missing data, using the Multiple Imputation via Chained Equations (MICE) package in R. Across 10 imputations, the mean frequencies for the no telehealth group at 6 months were 46.3% (Much Better), 30.7% (Better), 16.7% (About the Same), 2.3% (Worse), and 3.9% (Much Worse) and in the telehealth group were 38.3%, 41.1%, 15.3%, 2.9%, and 2.5%, respectively (frequencies to not add to exactly 100% due to rounding). Chi-squared analysis with continuity correction was used to determine if there were differences in the observed frequencies between groups (telehealth versus no telehealth) across the 5 levels of the Global Perception of Improvement question relative to the expected frequencies with each of the imputations, and p values were combined using the Enders (2001) method.</other_analysis_desc>

Chi-squared analysis with continuity correction was used to determine if there were differences in the observed frequencies between groups (telehealth versus no telehealth) across the 4 levels of the Activity Restriction question relative to the expected frequencies with each of the imputations, and p values were combined using the Enders (2001) method.</other_analysis_desc>

            <other_analysis_desc>Frequencies for the telehealth and no telehealth groups on the Resumption of Normal Activities question relative to the expected frequencies question are presented above. Multiple imputation was performed to account for missing data, using the Multiple Imputation via Chained Equations (MICE) package in R. Across 10 imputations, the mean frequencies for the no telehealth group at 6 months were 7.4% (None), 29.8% (Some), 62.8% (All) and in the telehealth group were 4.9%, 23.0%, and 72.2% respectively (frequencies to not add to exactly 100% due to rounding). Chi-squared analysis with continuity correction was used to determine if there were differences in the observed frequencies between groups (telehealth versus no telehealth) across the 3 levels of the Resumption of Normal Activities question relative to the expected frequencies with each of the imputations, and p values were combined using the Enders (2001) method.</other_analysis_desc>

          <description>Participants in this group will participate in an evidence-based pelvic floor muscle training program that has been adapted to telehealth format. Training is begun 1-4 weeks before surgery and continued 2 months after surgery. Content is accessed in 10-minute sessions on a secure website - daily preoperatively and for the first 2 months post-operatively, then weekly until 6 months post-operatively. In addition to the pelvic floor muscle training, content will also include general perioperative care; wetness, odor and skin care management; and outcome measures.&#xD;
