    <textblock>
      The CASCADE-FH Registry is a national, multi-center initiative that will track the therapy,&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, and patient-reported outcomes over time. The registry represents a&#xD;
      collaboration between The Familial Hypercholesterolemia Foundation, the Duke Clinical&#xD;
      Research Institute, lipid specialists, cardiologists, primary care providers, quality&#xD;
      improvement personnel, and patients, all aiming to increase FH awareness, promote optimal&#xD;
      disease management, and improve FH outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The FH Foundation CASCADE-FH Registry will implement an enrollment framework which is&#xD;
      characterized by three possible points of contact: 1) Clinic enrollment 2) Self-enrollment&#xD;
      through an online patient portal, and 3) Electronic Health Record (EHR) identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathway 1: Clinic-Based Screening and Enrollment During the initial study phase, a number of&#xD;
      specialized lipid clinics across the US will participate in the CASCADE-FH registry. FH&#xD;
      patients at these sites who meet inclusion will enroll. Each site will be required to receive&#xD;
      IRB approval and obtain patient consent. Once the initial set of specialized lipid clinics&#xD;
      has demonstrated acceptable feasibility for patient enrollment and engagement, additional&#xD;
      sites will be recruited into the registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathway 2: Patient Self-Enrollment Potential registry participants will have the opportunity&#xD;
      to self-enroll in the CASCADE-FH Registry through an online screening mechanism. A link on&#xD;
      the FH Foundation website (http://www.thefhfoundation.org) will direct potential participants&#xD;
      to a brief screening questionnaire see inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathway 3: Electronic Health Record (EHR) Screening System-wide searches of EHR to identify&#xD;
      potential FH patients based on LDL lab values and clinical FH criteria. Following&#xD;
      identification, the primary care provider of the potential FH patient is sent a notification&#xD;
      letter describing the patient's high LDL level, at-risk status and need for additional&#xD;
      screening. The patient may then undergo additional clinical or genetic testing and be&#xD;
      provided information about CASCADE-FH and registry participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection For data entered at clinical sites, the primary source of information will be&#xD;
      the patient's medical record. Baseline data will elements to be abstracted and entered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data elements entered by self-enrolled patients in the online patient portal will include a&#xD;
      subset of clinical information as well as questions on quality of life, disease-related&#xD;
      anxiety, and depression. A short survey to assess patient understanding of FH health risks,&#xD;
      available treatment options, and family member screening will also be included. The patient&#xD;
      questionnaire was designed to be free of clinical jargon and pilot-tested by FH patient&#xD;
      volunteers to ensure ease of use by participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followup data collection For patients enrolled at clinical sites, providers will be asked to&#xD;
      update information at yearly intervals. Medical records will be reviewed to assess changes in&#xD;
      medications, occurrence of major adverse cardiovascular events, hospitalizations, genetic&#xD;
      testing, and laboratory values updated since the last date of data entry. Follow-up data will&#xD;
      be collected yearly for 3 years following initial enrollment. Self-enrolled patients may&#xD;
      update data at any time by accessing the patient portal. Updated information on current&#xD;
      medication regimens, clinical events, and quality of life will be collected. However,&#xD;
      reminder emails will be sent to all self-enrolled patients on an annual basis to ensure&#xD;
      uniform entry of follow up information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-Reported Data Validation To ensure collection of high-quality data on FH&#xD;
      patient-reported outcomes, an annual validation of a proportion of self-enrolled patient&#xD;
      records will be conducted to assess concordance between information entered in the online&#xD;
      patient portal with data from their medical record. Following baseline data entry,&#xD;
      self-enrolled patients will be asked to provide contact information for their physicians and&#xD;
      to sign a medical release for validation of patient reported data. Of patients signing this&#xD;
      medical release, a randomly generated 10% sample will be selected for validation on a yearly&#xD;
      basis. Patient responses to questions regarding medication regimens, comorbid conditions,&#xD;
      clinical events and lab results will be compared to determine concordance between patient-&#xD;
      and physician-reported data. Overall agreement, sensitivity, specificity, and kappa&#xD;
      statistics will be evaluated to determine concordance between responses. Based on prior&#xD;
      validation analyses of patient-reported data, we expect moderate to good agreement between&#xD;
      the two data sources (Îš=0.40-0.80)19,20 Data elements with low rates of concordance will be&#xD;
      assessed for clarity and may be refined to enhance sensitivity and specificity. Supplemental&#xD;
      educational material may be provided for variables with low concordance to further promote&#xD;
      valid data capture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal Outcomes Serial lipid values will be a key outcome of interest and will be&#xD;
      examined to assess the adequacy of lipid modifying therapies to achieve target LDL values.&#xD;
      Longitudinal outcomes of interest will include medication changes, occurrence of major&#xD;
      adverse cardiovascular events, and mortality. Primary patient-reported outcomes of interest&#xD;
      will include notification and screening of family members, treatment satisfaction,&#xD;
      disease-related perceptions, and quality of life measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations The CASCADE-FH Registry will collect patient-reported and&#xD;
      clinician-reported information to characterize treatment patterns and outcomes among FH&#xD;
      patients. Because this study is not-hypothesis driven and no specific medical therapies or&#xD;
      treatment interventions are being compared, formal prospective calculations of sample sizes&#xD;
      are not necessary. However, we will periodically assess variations in lipid management,&#xD;
      clinical events, and patient-reported outcomes to evaluate temporal changes in these&#xD;
      variables. Standard statistical approaches commonly used in observational analyses will be&#xD;
      utilized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Feedback and Quality Improvement Sites participating in the CASCADE-FH Registry will&#xD;
      receive annual data feedback reports that will highlight treatment patterns, serial lipid&#xD;
      values, and clinical outcomes for their enrolled patients compared with the national results.&#xD;
      These reports will be designed to facilitate quality improvement interventions at&#xD;
      participating sites designed to improve the treatment and outcomes of FH patients.&#xD;
      Self-enrolled patients will have the opportunity to download their reported data directly as&#xD;
      well as through pre-programmed self-feedback, electronic reports that can be accessed at any&#xD;
      time.&#xD;
