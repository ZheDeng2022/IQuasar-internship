  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The kidneys are an important regulator of blood pressure. Previous research has shown that&#xD;
      disrupting the nerves (denervate) of the kidney may successfully decrease blood pressure. In&#xD;
      the past, one technique that was used to treat severe high blood pressure was a surgical&#xD;
      procedure to cut these nerves. However, this surgery is no longer commonly performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another approach to disrupting these nerves is to use the Beta-Cath 3.5F system to deliver a&#xD;
      small amount of radiation to the treatment zone. The Beta-Cath 3.5F System (Novoste) is&#xD;
      currently approved in the United States to deliver ion dose therapy to re-narrowings that&#xD;
      form in the coronary arteries in the heart. This trial is assessing the safety of treating&#xD;
      patients with the Beta-Cath 3.5F System (Novoste) to denervate the nerves around the kidney&#xD;
      to help control blood pressure in patients with uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Renal artery brachytherapy with beta-emitting source is safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Renal artery brachytherapy with beta-emitting source can reduce systolic/diastolic blood&#xD;
           pressure via renal denervation mechanism within 6 months post treatment.&#xD;
