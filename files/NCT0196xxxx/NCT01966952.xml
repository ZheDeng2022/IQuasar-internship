    <textblock>
      Renal sympathetic radioablation disrupts the nerves by high radiofrequency signal which&#xD;
      creates localized heat, eliminates the signal and decrease blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate blood pressure 12 months after radioablation,&#xD;
      and to evaluate the short and long-term effects of the renal radioablation on the extent of&#xD;
      changes in urine catecholamines level, vascular stiffness, and sympathetic nerve activity as&#xD;
      linked with the changes in blood pressure. The study will also evaluate the effect&#xD;
      radioablation has on the renal arteries as well as develop teaching sessions for family&#xD;
      physicians and other specialists to educate them on this new treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy, safety and selected mechanisms of&#xD;
      renal sympathetic radioablation. The primary outcome of this study is change in BP 12 months&#xD;
      post treatment as assessed from daytime average of systolic BP from 24-hr ABPM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this innovation program, we propose to evaluate the following aspects of renal sympathetic&#xD;
      radioablation RSRA in Patients with Resistant HTN:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Assessment of BP lowering effect in patients with true resistant HTN. In contrast to&#xD;
           studies done so far, we will evaluate the true BP lowering effect of RSRA by performance&#xD;
           of 24-hr ABPM prior to and at defined time points post procedure. We will screen out&#xD;
           pseudohypertension using direct observed therapy. We will employ a rigorous protocol to&#xD;
           include only patients with truly resistant HTN. Namely, we will screen for major forms&#xD;
           of secondary HTN such as renal artery stenosis, pheochromocytoma, primary&#xD;
           hyperaldosteronism, and Cushing's syndrome and exclude these patients from&#xD;
           radioablation. We will also address the issue of white coat phenomena as a cause of&#xD;
           false diagnosis of resistant HTN by 24-hr ABPM. This innovative approach will ensure a&#xD;
           proper evaluation of the BP lowering potential of this method, as patients with&#xD;
           secondary forms of HTN may not respond to RSRA. In contrast, those with white coat&#xD;
           effect may show gradual improvement in BP control over time unrelated to RSRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Safety: Imaging of the renal arteries. Our patients will undergo CT angiogram imaging of&#xD;
           their renal arteries prior to procedure and at defined time points afterwards. In&#xD;
           studies reported so far, imaging of the renal arteries was not standardized. In animals&#xD;
           (swines) subjected to RSRA using the same catheter, renal arteries showed fibrosis of&#xD;
           10-25% of the total media and underlying adventitia, with mild disruption of the&#xD;
           external elastic lamina. Furthermore, a case report has been published documenting renal&#xD;
           artery stenosis within 3 months post RSRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Education on diagnosis and treatment of resistant HTN. As resistant HTN is frequently&#xD;
           misdiagnosed and consequently poorly treated, we will develop teaching sessions for&#xD;
           family physicians, general internists, and subspecialists from this LHIN region to make&#xD;
           them aware of issues related to diagnosis of true resistant HTN and to educate them on&#xD;
           this new option of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Mechanism:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of RSRA on Central Sympathetic Outflow, PWV, and aldosterone will be assessed pre and&#xD;
      post RSRA and correlated to (changes in) BP prior to and at defined time points post RSRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a new method for treatment of patients with resistant HTN. As our team has&#xD;
      successfully treated two patients with resistant HTN in June 2012 (as the second team and&#xD;
      centre in Canada), TOH/UOHI with experts in Clinical HTN, Nephrology, Interventional&#xD;
      Cardiology and Interventional Radiology are uniquely positioned to establish and critically&#xD;
      evaluate the suitability of this method for patients from our LHIN region. Pilot data on&#xD;
      Pulse Wave Velocity, MSNA and aldosterone by RSRA will shed light on mechanisms involved in&#xD;
      BP lowering by RSRA and will be used for the development of grant applications to Canadian&#xD;
      peer review funding agencies.&#xD;
