  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive renal impairment in chronic kidney diseases (CKD) may cause inability to excrete&#xD;
      phosphate load, thus leading to the typical abnormalities of the mineral metabolism, such as&#xD;
      increased phosphate and reduced calcium levels, 1,25- dihydroxyvitamin D deficiency and&#xD;
      secondary hyperparathyroidism (HPT). Treatment with vitamin D analogues and/or phosphate&#xD;
      binders ameliorates these abnormalities that are also associated with accelerated renal&#xD;
      disease progression and increased cardiovascular risk. However in a post-hoc analysis of 331&#xD;
      patients with proteinuric chronic nephropathies included in the Ramipril Efficacy In&#xD;
      Nephropathy (REIN) trial, increasing serum phosphate levels at inclusion, even within the&#xD;
      normal reference range, were associated with an incremental risk of progression to End Stage&#xD;
      Renal Disease (ESRD). Moreover, increasing levels of serum phosphate were associated with a&#xD;
      progressively decreasing protective effect of ramipril therapy against progression to ESRD,&#xD;
      to the point that the benefit of Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme (ACE) inhibition was almost&#xD;
      fully lost among patients with serum phosphate levels exceeding 4.5 mg/dL. This finding&#xD;
      provided convincing evidence that phosphate plays a direct pathogenic role in patients with&#xD;
      progressive nephropathies and that excess phosphate exposure may limit or even blunt the&#xD;
      renoprotective effect of ACE inhibitor therapy in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sevelamer carbonate is a newly approved phosphate binder for chronic kidney disease (CKD)&#xD;
      patients not yet on maintenance dialysis. Treatment with Sevelamer, in addition to correct&#xD;
      hyperphosphatemia, was also found to ameliorate abnormalities of the mineral metabolism&#xD;
      associated with accelerated renal disease progression and increased cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
      Moreover, Sevelamer therapy reduces proteinuria in an animal model of uremia, an effect that&#xD;
      in the long term might translate into significant renoprotection. These findings suggest that&#xD;
      serum phosphate might be a specific target for renoprotective therapy in CKD patients and&#xD;
      provide the background for randomized clinical trials to formally test whether reducing&#xD;
      phosphate exposure by phosphate binding agents may serve to optimize the renoprotective&#xD;
      effect of RAS inhibition in this population. Thus, whether phosphate reduction by Sevelamer&#xD;
      carbonate therapy may have a specific antiproteinuric effect in humans with chronic&#xD;
      nephropathies and residual proteinuria despite optimized RAS inhibitor therapy is worth&#xD;
      investigating.&#xD;
