  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy and its incidence is rapidly&#xD;
      increasing. Palpable thyroid nodules are very common, affecting up to 5% of the general&#xD;
      population. Nevertheless, only 5% of the thyroid nodules harbor malignancy, hence the obvious&#xD;
      need to accurately characterize these nodules. Ultrasound guided fine needle aspiration&#xD;
      biopsy (FNAB) is the most important tool in assessing the nature of thyroid nodules, however,&#xD;
      in up to 30% of the biopsies the results are indeterminate. In this proposal, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that leftover cells in the FNAB needle may be utilized for molecular analysis with an&#xD;
      established microRNA panel and distinguish between malignant and benign lesions. Despite&#xD;
      established studies on the diagnostic utility of microRNAs in thyroid nodules, the effect of&#xD;
      microRNAs on specific target genes involved in thyroid cancer is poorly studied. In this&#xD;
      proposal we hypothesize that the microRNAs identified in our panel will affect intracellular&#xD;
      pathways by regulating target genes that are involved in thyroid tumorigenesis. We present&#xD;
      preliminary data that confirms that microRNA panel may identify malignancy in thyroid&#xD;
      nodules. In aim 1 we will identify the expression profile of miRNAs in the different thyroid&#xD;
      cancers. We will statistically quantify the threshold of miRNA dysregulation for malignancy&#xD;
      on a large number of tumor and benign samples. This will serve as matrix for defining&#xD;
      malignancy on the FNAB samples. In aim 2 we will establish a reliable reproducible method to&#xD;
      extract RNA from cells left over in FNAB samples. Our preliminary data support the&#xD;
      feasibility of the method and it has not been described previously. This will be the first&#xD;
      study that will compare cytology results and microRNA panel analysis on the very same FNAB&#xD;
      cells. It will mimic the exact clinical scenario that such microRNA panel can be utilized in&#xD;
      the future. Finally, in aim 3 we will characterize the effect of microRNAs on target genes&#xD;
      expression. We will identify possible target genes from bioinformatics databases and will&#xD;
      perform quantitative measurement of mRNA level of target gene by real time PCR and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry. These studies will hopefully support the utility of microRNAs as a&#xD;
      diagnostic tool to accurately identify malignancy in thyroid FNAB leftover cells and point&#xD;
      out possible target genes for future therapeutic approaches. This could impact many patients,&#xD;
      as thyroid cancer is the 5th most common cancer in women, and the most rapidly growing&#xD;
      malignancy in both men and women.&#xD;
