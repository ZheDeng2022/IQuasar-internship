      Study Title: A study to compare two articular cartilage repair techniques in the knee joint:&#xD;
      The use of Cultured Chondrocytes Vs. Cultured bone marrow aspiration cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis: We start with the hypothesis that both treatments are equally effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Design: The participating patients will be divided into two groups, each group&#xD;
      receiving either one of the treatment modalities. This study will not be randomised or&#xD;
      blinded. Both procedures will be done at the Spire Alexandra Hospital by Professor A. A&#xD;
      Shetty, who is one half of the team that devised both techniques. The post-operative&#xD;
      rehabilitation process will be the same for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Participants: All participants will be from patients attending Professor Shetty's&#xD;
      clinic at the Spire Alexandra Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Sample Size: 50 patients in each group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up duration: The participating patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3&#xD;
      months, 6 months, 1 year and 2 years following the surgery by visits to the clinic and&#xD;
      assessed clinically. The surgical outcomes will be measured by by IKDC, KOOS and Lysholm&#xD;
      scores; cartilage growth will be measured by the MOCART score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Trial Period: Two to three years&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To establish superiority, if any, of either procedure over the other by&#xD;
      studying pain relief, cartilage growth and improvement in function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint: At the end of the 2 year follow up for all participating patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Articular cartilage repair in the knee is aimed at young patients with area(s) of cartilage&#xD;
      loss and no deformity of the knee. These patients aren't indicated for a knee replacement.&#xD;
      Articular cartilage repair leads to improvement of symptoms of pain, locking and function.&#xD;
      Traditionally, articular cartilage repair has always involved exposing the entire knee joint&#xD;
      with an arthrotomy. This, though effective, would lead to a large scar, longer hospital stay,&#xD;
      longer rehabilitation and its associated complications. Also, the use of Bone Marrow Aspirate&#xD;
      Cells (BMAC) for the purpose of cartilage repair has long been debated with both sides having&#xD;
      valid arguments and good surgical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, one method (Cultured Chondrocytes) requires an arthroscopy and an arthrotomy,&#xD;
      takes 6 weeks to complete and is followed by 6 weeks of partial weight bearing on the&#xD;
      operated leg. The other method (Cultured BMAC) is done arthroscopically, followed by 4&#xD;
      injections into the affected knee and takes 6 weeks to complete which includes 6 weeks of&#xD;
      partial weight bearing on the operated leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both procedures have shown encouraging results in terms of pain relief, cartilage growth and&#xD;
      improved function. The use of cultured chondrocytes requires two surgeries and takes a total&#xD;
      of 12 weeks till the patient can walk without support while the use of cultured BMAC involves&#xD;
      only one surgery and can have the patient walking unsupported in 6 weeks. This study aims to&#xD;
      ascertain if either technique is superior to the other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the cultured BMAC technique is shown to be superior, it could mean lesser surgery and&#xD;
      faster recovery for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This study aims to compare two techniques of articular cartilage repair in the&#xD;
      knee, namely the use of cultured chondrocytes and the use of cultured bone marrow aspirate&#xD;
      cells (BMAC). The principal objective of is to ascertain and assess the superiority, if any,&#xD;
      of either surgical technique over the other. The superiority will be assessed with by the&#xD;
      certain scoring systems (IKDC, KOOS, Lysholm and MOCART) measured pre- and post-operatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on which procedure the patient chooses to have, they will be allotted to either the&#xD;
      cultured chondrocytes group or the cultured BMAC group. The patient is followed up in the&#xD;
      clinic at the Spire Alexandra Hospital at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 1 year and 2&#xD;
      years following the surgery and their progress is documented by questionnaires and clinical&#xD;
      examination. MRI scans are done at one and two years to assess the extent of cartilage&#xD;
      growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SURGICAL TECHNIQUES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cultured chondrocytes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method has two stages. In the first stage, a knee arthroscopy is done to harvest viable&#xD;
      cartilage cells which are then sent to a lab to be cultured for 6 weeks. The entry ports are&#xD;
      then closed and the knee is covered with a sterile dressing. The patient is transferred to&#xD;
      the surgical recovery ward and, when medically stable, then transferred to their room on the&#xD;
      ward. After discharge from the hospital, the patient is advised partial weight bearing on the&#xD;
      operated leg for six weeks after the surgery. They also undergo five sessions of&#xD;
      physiotherapy. Surgical clips and sutures are removed at 2 weeks following the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, an arthrotomy is performed. The area of cartilage deficiency is prepared&#xD;
      and the cultured cells are transplanted onto it. The incision is then closed and the knee is&#xD;
      covered with a sterile dressing. The patient is transferred to the surgical recovery ward&#xD;
      and, when medically stable, then transferred to their room on the ward. After discharge from&#xD;
      the hospital, the patient is advised partial weight bearing on the operated leg for 6 weeks&#xD;
      after the surgery. They also undergo 5 sessions of physiotherapy. Surgical clips and sutures&#xD;
      are removed at 2 weeks following the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cultured BMAC:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This method also has two major stages. The first stage involves harvesting BMAC from the&#xD;
      patient's iliac crest (hip bone), which are then sent to the laboratory for culture for 3&#xD;
      weeks. Simultaneously, an arthroscopy is performed on the affected knee and the area of&#xD;
      cartilage deficiency is debrided and microfractured. The entry ports are then closed and the&#xD;
      knee is covered with a sterile dressing. The patient is transferred to the surgical recovery&#xD;
      ward and, when medically stable, then transferred to their room on the ward. After discharge&#xD;
      from the hospital, the patient is advised partial weight bearing on the operated leg for six&#xD;
      weeks after the surgery. They also undergo five sessions of physiotherapy. Surgical clips and&#xD;
      sutures are removed at 2 weeks following the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the second stage, the cultured BMAC are injected into the affected knee and cells attach&#xD;
      themselves to the microfractured area. The patient is then recalled at 4, 5 and 6 weeks from&#xD;
      the first stage for an injection of Hyaluronic Acid into the operated knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Patients in both arms will be followed up at 2,6,12,26,52 and 104 weeks following&#xD;
      the end of the second stage of the procedure. Parameters noted will be pain relief,&#xD;
      improvement in function and cartilage growth as assessed by MRI scans at one and two years.&#xD;
