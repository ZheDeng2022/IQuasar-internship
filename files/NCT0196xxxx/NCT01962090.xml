  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the short term effects of two different thoracic spine&#xD;
      thrust manipulation techniques on neck range of motion, pain, and self-reported disability in&#xD;
      a sample of dental students experiencing neck pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that there will be a difference between the two thoracic spine&#xD;
      thrust manipulation techniques for short term effects on neck range of motion, pain, and&#xD;
      self-reported disability in a sample of dental students experiencing neck pain.&#xD;
