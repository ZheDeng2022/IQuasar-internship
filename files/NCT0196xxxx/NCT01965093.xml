  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The most serious peri-operative respiratory event (PRE) in pediatric anesthesia is&#xD;
      desaturation or hypoxemia which could lead to cardiovascular collapse or cardiac arrest.&#xD;
      Intermittent hypoxic episode especially in infants are also associated with impaired growth,&#xD;
      longer-term cardiorespiratory instability and poor neurodevelopmental outcome.12 The&#xD;
      mechanism of peri-operative desaturation occurring in normoxia infant brain is quite similar&#xD;
      to overabundance of oxygen in the acutely hypoxic infant by using 100% oxygen or hyperoxia&#xD;
      for resuscitation of acutely asphyxiated infants which can generate excessive neurotoxic&#xD;
      compounds and increase oxidative stress markers.17 Anesthetic agents which involve&#xD;
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)receptors eg; volatile agents, midazolam and&#xD;
      N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) receptors eg; nitrous oxide, ketamine can cause neuronal&#xD;
      apoptosis, neuronal necrosis, neuronal cell death and memory deficit in rat pups. Moreover,&#xD;
      prolonged anesthetic exposure, irrespective of open heart surgery, can influence&#xD;
      neurodevelopment of the brain in rodents.17 However, the evidence for anesthetic agents&#xD;
      causing apoptosis and neurodegeneration in human neonatal brain is still not clear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, peri-operative desaturation occurred in young age regardless of severity combined with&#xD;
      general anesthesia might possibly affect the long-term impact regarding growth and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental outcome in infant or intelligence outcome in older children. In our study,&#xD;
      we are interested in looking at the intelligence outcome, which is a part of neurodevelopment&#xD;
      outcome, in preschool children aged ≤ 5 years who developed desaturation peri-operatively.&#xD;
      Because we include a wide range of age between newborn to five years old to test&#xD;
      neurodevelopment outcome in older children, the intelligence outcome may be more appropriate&#xD;
      and can be applied to infants and younger ages. Therefore, the objective of study was to&#xD;
      compare intelligence outcome between children who developed peri-operative desaturation and&#xD;
      children who did not develop PRE.&#xD;

      Material and methods A historical and concurrent follow up study was conducted at&#xD;
      Songklanagarind Hospital, an 853-bed tertiary care hospital in southern Thailand, after&#xD;
      approval by the Ethics Committee, Prince of Songkla University at November 15th, 2012.&#xD;
      Written informed consent was signed by all parents who participated in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Children aged ≤ 5 years old who received general anesthesia (GA)and developed&#xD;
      intraoperative or post-anesthetic care unit (PACU)desaturation were included in the study and&#xD;
      was defined as desaturation group. The exclusion criteria were ASA (American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologist) classification 4 or 5, preoperative oxygen saturation &lt; 95% at room air,&#xD;
      required preoperative endotracheal tube intubation (ETT) or mechanical ventilation, had&#xD;
      congenital heart disease or open heart surgery, had neurosurgery, had preoperative delayed&#xD;
      development, and had perinatal hypoxia or fetal growth retardation. Perioperative&#xD;
      desaturation was defined as oxygen saturation &lt; 95% for more than 10 seconds [9]. Children in&#xD;
      desaturation group were matched with children in non-desaturation group one per one by the&#xD;
      same sex, same age within the same year of general anesthesia, same type of surgery and same&#xD;
      technique of anesthesia. Non-desaturation group was defined as children who did not developed&#xD;
      perioperative respiratory events eg; desaturation, laryngospasm, bronchospasm, upper airway&#xD;
      obstruction and reintubation. After a child from desaturation group was identified, one child&#xD;
      from non-desaturation group was randomly selected from the lists of 3 to 4 children matching&#xD;
      with same demographic, same surgery and same anesthesia profile above. The parents of both&#xD;
      groups were contacted by the investigator by phone call and invitation postcard. If selected&#xD;
      child in the non-desaturation group was declined by the parents or could not be reached, the&#xD;
      next child on the list would be randomly selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome of interest The outcomes of interest were divided into growth developmental outcome&#xD;
      and intelligence outcome. The intelligence outcome and growth developmental outcome were&#xD;
      evaluated at least 6 months after exposing to general anesthesia. Children aged between at&#xD;
      least 2 years and not more than 9 years were equally compared the outcomes of interest&#xD;
      between desaturation and non-desaturation groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For growth development outcome, preoperative body weight, percentile weight, height and&#xD;
      percentile height were compared with the current body weight, current height, percentile&#xD;
      weight and percentile height. Month age of first meaning word and month age of first walk&#xD;
      will be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome will be intelligence score or intelligence quotient (IQ) score. There are&#xD;
      two intelligence tests available in Songklanagarind hospital which are suitable for testing&#xD;
      intelligence outcome in this study; the Standford Binet form L-M and Wechsler Intelligence&#xD;
      Scale for Children, 3rd edition (WISC-III). The same aged of children in desaturation and&#xD;
      non-desaturation groups were appointed to have an IQ test during the study period. A child&#xD;
      psychologist (T.D.) performed the IQ test in all children. The Standford Binet form L-M was&#xD;
      the main intelligence test used in our study. It measures cognitive ability regarding verbal&#xD;
      reasoning, quantitative reasoning, abstract and visual reasoning and short-term memory skills&#xD;
      and a wide range of IQ score varying from 20 to 140. The suitable age for using the Standford&#xD;
      Binet form L-M is between 2 to 7 years old. The WISC-III test was used for supplemental test&#xD;
      for children who reached the ceiling aged of 7 years and still could not complete IQ&#xD;
      measurement. The WISC-III consists of 2 main subtests eg; the verbal subtests and performance&#xD;
      subtests (nonverbal subtest) which the average IQ score was used to compared between 2&#xD;
      groups. The same IQ score of each IQ test was considered to have the similar level of&#xD;
      intelligence outcome in the study. The type of IQ test was recorded and compared between 2&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential predictor variables The children and family related predictors and anesthesia&#xD;
      related predictors were included in the data record. The children and family related&#xD;
      predictors were history of prematurity, history of parental smoking, religion, mother age at&#xD;
      delivery, mother occupation, father occupation, monthly family income, mother education,&#xD;
      father education, children education, training by parents (no, partial or regular) and&#xD;
      children capability (full help, partial help or no help).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of training by parents Training by parents was defined as developmental&#xD;
      stimulation and training by parents or caregivers including with the following statement eg;&#xD;
      (1) teaching them to do thing by themselves compatible to their age, if you do regularly in&#xD;
      days or weeks considered to be regular stimulation and training,if you do sometimes or once&#xD;
      in a while considered to be partial stimulation and training. (2) asking them a simple&#xD;
      question to stimulate their mind, if you do regularly in days or weeks considered to be&#xD;
      regular stimulation and training, if you do sometimes or once in a while considered to be&#xD;
      partial stimulation and training. (3) Taking them outside for a ride or to the playground and&#xD;
      stimulating them by showing things, people, animal or asking questions, if you do regularly&#xD;
      in days or weeks by both taking them outside and stimulating their mind considered to be&#xD;
      regular stimulation and training, if you do sometimes or once in a while considered to be&#xD;
      partial stimulation and training, if you take them outside but not stimulate their mind&#xD;
      considered to be partial stimulation and training. (4) Buying them a stimulation toys and&#xD;
      play with them, if you buy toys and play with them regularly in days or weeks considered to&#xD;
      be regular stimulation and training, if you buy them toys but not play with them considered&#xD;
      to be partial stimulation and training or if none of the 4 items is performed considered to&#xD;
      be no stimulation and training. Training by parents was classified as 3 categories which were&#xD;
      no training, partial training or regular training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of children capability Children capability was defined as capability of children&#xD;
      who are able to do things by themselves compatible to their age. For 2 to 3 years of age,&#xD;
      children can climb up stair and down stair, can climb off the cot and can take off their&#xD;
      cloth. For 3 to 5 years of age, children can eat by spoon, can take a shower, can brush their&#xD;
      teeth and can ride a 3 wheel bike. For 5 to 6 years of age, children can get dressed with no&#xD;
      button, can go to the toilet and can wear shoes without shoelaces. For 6 to 8 years of age,&#xD;
      children can draw and write on the paper, can get dressed and do the button and can tie a&#xD;
      shoelace. Children capability was classified as 3 categories which were full help, partial&#xD;
      help and no help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia related predictors were ASA classification, time of repeated GA, type of surgery,&#xD;
      choice of GA, technique of GA, induction agents, intubation agents, inhalation agents, gas&#xD;
      mixed with oxygen, narcotic and duration of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Analysis was performed with the R program version 2.14.1. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics was computed for all variables and include frequency, proportion, mean + standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) and median (interquartile range; IQR). Predictor variables were continuous or&#xD;
      categorical data either originally or if categorical data, after categorizing by selection of&#xD;
      suitable cut points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growth developmental outcome eg; the current body weight, current height, percentile&#xD;
      weight and percentile height including other continuous data such as age at index GA, the&#xD;
      current age, weight and height at index GA, percentile weight and height at index, mother age&#xD;
      at delivery, monthly family income, first meaning word, first walk, time of repeated GA,&#xD;
      duration of anesthesia were analyzed by Student's t- test or non- parametric rank sum test as&#xD;
      appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical data consisting of children and family profiles eg; gender, history of&#xD;
      prematurity, history of parental smoking, religion, mother occupation, father occupation,&#xD;
      mother education, father education, children education, training by parents, children&#xD;
      capability; and anesthesia profiles eg; ASA (American Society of Anesthesiologist)&#xD;
      classification, type of surgery, choice of GA, technique of GA, induction agents, intubation&#xD;
      agents, inhalation agents, gas mixed with oxygen and narcotics were compared using the&#xD;
      Chi-square test or Fisher 's exact test as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IQ score was compared between desaturation and non-desaturation group using simple linear&#xD;
      regression model. The other explanatory variables that may be related to IQ score, percentile&#xD;
      weight and percentile height were analyzed using multiple linear regression models if showing&#xD;
      some evidence of differing across outcome categories in univariate analysis (p ≤ 0.2). The&#xD;
      magnitudes and precision of associations will be indicated by adjusted coefficient and their&#xD;
      95% confidence intervals. In multivariate modeling techniques, association with outcome will&#xD;
      be considered significant if the likelihood ratio p-values are ≤ 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation The sample size calculation is based on comparison of an IQ score&#xD;
      between desaturation group and non-desaturation group after receiving general anesthesia.&#xD;
      According to National Thai Survey of 72,780 school children over 76 provinces in 2007-2008&#xD;
      using the Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM parallel version; updated 2003)45, the average&#xD;
      IQ score of Thai children is 98.59 whereas the average IQ score of southern Thai children is&#xD;
      a bit lower (96.85). We assumed that 5 point difference in IQ score would have an impact to&#xD;
      the intelligence outcome of school children (aged &lt; 9 year old). Therefore, the sample size&#xD;
      for testing hypothesis of a difference between 2 means based on the mean difference of IQ&#xD;
      score of 5 and standard deviation of 12 would be 91 children per group under a power of 80%&#xD;
      and type I error of 5% and 102 children per group would be required to compensate of 10% drop&#xD;
      out under data collection.&#xD;
