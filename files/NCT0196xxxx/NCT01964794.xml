      Clinically relevant biomarkers for warfarin identified in this study will provide crucial&#xD;
      leads for subsequent studies to assess their predictive value during anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
      This knowledge will aid stratifying risk among patients to improve therapeutic outcomes and&#xD;
      decrease adverse drug events and associated health care costs. Collectively, these efforts&#xD;
      will provide a critical foundation for future research using a metabolite biomarker strategy&#xD;
      in a clinical setting to revolutionize warfarin therapy. Through its application, a real-time&#xD;
      assessment of warfarin metabolism for each patient could lead to a truly personalized dosing&#xD;
      strategy and improve patient safety for this life-saving drug.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coumadin (R/S-warfarin) is a commonly prescribed anticoagulant for over 20 million Americans&#xD;
      for the treatment of atrial fibrillation, mechanical heart valves, venous thromboembolism and&#xD;
      other coagulopathies. While highly efficacious, warfarin treatment is challenging due to a&#xD;
      narrow therapeutic range and high inter-individual variations in response. Optimal warfarin&#xD;
      dosage relies on a potentially lengthy trial-and-error process to optimize dosage for a&#xD;
      desired anticoagulant response as measured by the international normalization ratio (INR), a&#xD;
      prothrombin test. Even when a maintenance dose is achieved, patients are prone to testing out&#xD;
      of the target INR range, and thus are at risk of hemorrhaging (over-dosing) or&#xD;
      thromboembolism (under-dosing). In fact, warfarin is among the top ten drug-related causes of&#xD;
      serious adverse drug events and increased health care costs. The progressive increase in&#xD;
      warfarin use necessitates a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      inter-individual variability in responses to anticoagulant therapy. Our long-term goal is to&#xD;
      identify metabolic biomarkers correlating with clinical responses to warfarin therapy and&#xD;
      then utilize this knowledge to predict safe and effective dosing for patients based on a&#xD;
      single blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therapeutic outcomes for patients involve a balance between warfarin dosing and its&#xD;
      metabolism to maintain a stable target INR. There is an initial lengthy titration stage in&#xD;
      which dosing is increased to achieve but not surpass a target INR range. The potency of this&#xD;
      effect depends on warfarin metabolism, which counters the dosing effect on patients by&#xD;
      inactivating the drug. Warfarin undergoes extensive metabolism through distinct enantio- and&#xD;
      regio-specific metabolic pathways to yield a complex array of essentially inactive isomeric&#xD;
      metabolites. Warfarin is clinically available as an equal mixture of R and S enantiomers.&#xD;
      S-Warfarin is about four times more potent than R-warfarin, and presumably dominates the&#xD;
      anticoagulant response to therapy. During maintenance dosing, a longer metabolic half-life&#xD;
      for R-warfarin leads to higher accumulation levels in plasma than those observed for&#xD;
      S-warfarin. Variations in R-and S-warfarin plasma levels may potentiate the anticoagulant&#xD;
      effect of both drug isomers and the corresponding responses to therapy. For our exploratory&#xD;
      study, we will identify biomarkers within patient metabolic profiles for R-and S-warfarin&#xD;
      that predict clinical outcomes for the patients.&#xD;

        Originally, for this pilot study, we chose a sample population size of 150 with a focus on&#xD;
        veterans from the Korean War. Towards the end of recruitment the protocol was revised to&#xD;
        remove the focus on veterans from just the Korean War.&#xD;
