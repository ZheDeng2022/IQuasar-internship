  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This two-arm, randomized, open-label, multicenter study will evaluate the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of trastuzumab emtansine in combination with pertuzumab versus trastuzumab in combination&#xD;
      with pertuzumab and a taxane as adjuvant therapy in participants with human epidermal growth&#xD;
      (HER) factor 2 (HER2)-positive primary invasive breast cancer. Following surgery and&#xD;
      anthracycline-based chemotherapy, participants will receive either trastuzumab emtansine at a&#xD;
      dose of 3.6 milligrams per kilogram (mg/kg) and pertuzumab at a dose of 420 milligrams (mg)&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) every 3 weeks (q3w) or trastuzumab at a dose of 6 mg/kg and pertuzumab at&#xD;
      a dose of 420 mg IV q3w in combination with a taxane.&#xD;

    <measure>Invasive Disease-Free Survival (IDFS) in the Node-Positive Subpopulation</measure>
    <time_frame>First participant randomized to data cut-off date of 27 November 2019 (approximately 70 months). The 3 year IDFS event-free rate was assessed based on the data collected for each participant considering the cut-off date mentioned above.</time_frame>
    <description>IDFS event was defined as the first occurrence of one of the following events: Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence (i.e., an invasive breast cancer involving the same breast parenchyma as the original primary lesion); ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence (i.e., an invasive breast cancer in the axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and/or skin of the ipsilateral breast); distant recurrence (i.e., evidence of breast cancer in any anatomic site - other than the two above mentioned sites); death attributable to any cause; contralateral invasive breast cancer. 3-year IDFS event-free rate per randomized treatment arms in the ITT population were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a patient being event-free after 3 years after randomization.</description>

    <measure>IDFS Plus Second Primary Non-Breast Cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>IDFS including second primary non-breast cancer was defined the same way as IDFS for the primary endpoint but including second primary non breast invasive cancer as an event (with the exception of non-melanoma skin cancers and carcinoma in situ (CIS) of any site). 3-year IDFS including second primary non-breast cancer event-free rates per treatment arm in the ITT population were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a patient being event-free after 3 years after randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Disease-Free Survival (DFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>DFS was defined as time between randomization and first occurrence of IDFS, second primary non-breast cancer and contralateral or ipsilateral ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS). 3-year DFS event-free rates per randomized treatment arms in the ITT population were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a patient being event-free after 3 years after randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Distant Recurrence-Free Interval (DRFI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>DRFI was defined as time between randomization and first occurrence of distant breast cancer recurrence. 3 years DRFI event-free rate per randomized treatment arms in the ITT population were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a patient being event-free after 3 years after randomization.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS was defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. 5 years OS event-free rate per randomized treatment arms in the ITT population were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a patient being event-free after 5 years after randomization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events</measure>
    <time_frame>From randomization to data cut-off date of 27 November 2019 (approximately 70 months)</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. AEs were reported based on the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for AEs, Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE, v4.0).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants With Decrease in Left Ventricular Ejection Fraction (LVEF) From Baseline Over Time</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to approximately 10 years</time_frame>
    <description>LVEF was assessed using either echocardiogram (ECHO) or multiple-gated acquisition (MUGA) scans.</description>

    <measure>European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Quality of Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (QLQ-C30) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 14, End of Treatment, Follow-up Month 6, Follow-up Month 12, Follow-up Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>The EORTC QLQ-C30 included global health status, functional scales (physical, role, emotional, cognitive, and social), symptom scales (fatigue, nausea/vomiting, and pain) and single items (dyspnoea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea, and financial difficulties). Most questions used a 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale [1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent']). Scores were averaged and transformed to 0 - 100 scale, whereby higher scores indicate greater functioning, greater quality of life, or a greater degree of symptoms, with changes of 7 - 15 points considered to be a clinically meaningful detioration to participants. A positive value means an increase, while a negative value means a decrease, in score at the indicated time-point relative to the score at baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Breast Cancer 23 (QLQ-BR23) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 14, End of Treatment, Follow-up Month 6, Follow-up Month 12, Follow-up Month 18</time_frame>
    <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the EORTC-QLQ-C30. There are four functional scales (body image, sexual enjoyment, sexual functioning, future perspective [FP]) and four symptom scales (systemic side effects [SE], upset by hair loss, arm symptoms, breast symptoms). Questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Scores averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale. High score for functional scale indicated high/better level of functioning/healthy functioning. Higher scores for symptom scales represent higher levels of symptoms/problems. For functional scales, positive change from baseline indicated improvement in quality of life (QOL) while negative change from baseline indicated a deterioration. For symptom scales, positive change from baseline indicated deterioration and negative change indicated improvement.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Time to Clinically Meaningful Deterioration in the Global Health Status/ Quality of Life and Functional (Physical, Role, and Cognitive) Subscales of the QLQ-C30 From First HER2-Targeted Treatment</measure>
    <time_frame>From start of HER-2 targeted treatment up to 18 months after treatment discontinuation. The median time to clinically meaningful deterioration was assessed based on the data collection described above.</time_frame>
    <description>The time to clinically meaningful deterioration in the global health status/HRQoL subscale (question 29 and 30 of the QLQ-C30) was used to assess the time from first HER2-targeted treatment to worsening in HRQoL. Clinically meaningful deterioration is defined as a decrease in score of 10 points in Physical functioning and HRQoL; decrease of 7 points in Cognitive functioning, and decrease of 14 points in Role functioning.</description>

        <description>IDFS event was defined as the first occurrence of one of the following events: Ipsilateral invasive breast tumor recurrence (i.e., an invasive breast cancer involving the same breast parenchyma as the original primary lesion); ipsilateral local-regional invasive breast cancer recurrence (i.e., an invasive breast cancer in the axilla, regional lymph nodes, chest wall, and/or skin of the ipsilateral breast); distant recurrence (i.e., evidence of breast cancer in any anatomic site - other than the two above mentioned sites); death attributable to any cause; contralateral invasive breast cancer. 3-year IDFS event-free rate per randomized treatment arms in the ITT population were estimated using the Kaplan-Meier method and estimated the probability of a patient being event-free after 3 years after randomization.</description>
        <time_frame>First participant randomized to data cut-off date of 27 November 2019 (approximately 70 months). The 3 year IDFS event-free rate was assessed based on the data collected for each participant considering the cut-off date mentioned above.</time_frame>

          <population>The ITT Population comprised all randomized patients, whether or not they received any study treatment or completed a full course of study treatment. Patients were analyzed according to their randomized treatment.</population>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Adverse Events</title>
        <description>An adverse event is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product and which does not necessarily have to have a causal relationship with the treatment. An adverse event can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding, for example), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a pharmaceutical product, whether or not considered related to the pharmaceutical product. Preexisting conditions which worsen during a study are also considered as adverse events. AEs were reported based on the national cancer institute common terminology criteria for AEs, Version 4.0 (NCI-CTCAE, v4.0).</description>

Most questions used a 4-point scale (1 'Not at all' to 4 'Very much'; 2 questions used 7-point scale [1 'very poor' to 7 'Excellent']). Scores were averaged and transformed to 0 - 100 scale, whereby higher scores indicate greater functioning, greater quality of life, or a greater degree of symptoms, with changes of 7 - 15 points considered to be a clinically meaningful detioration to participants. A positive value means an increase, while a negative value means a decrease, in score at the indicated time-point relative to the score at baseline (Cycle 1, Day 1).</description>

        <title>EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire-Breast Cancer 23 (QLQ-BR23) Score</title>
        <description>EORTC-QLQ-BR23 is a 23-item breast cancer-specific companion module to the EORTC-QLQ-C30. There are four functional scales (body image, sexual enjoyment, sexual functioning, future perspective [FP]) and four symptom scales (systemic side effects [SE], upset by hair loss, arm symptoms, breast symptoms). Questions used 4-point scale (1=not at all, 2=a little, 3=quite a bit, 4=very much). Scores averaged and transformed to 0-100 scale. High score for functional scale indicated high/better level of functioning/healthy functioning. Higher scores for symptom scales represent higher levels of symptoms/problems. For functional scales, positive change from baseline indicated improvement in quality of life (QOL) while negative change from baseline indicated a deterioration. For symptom scales, positive change from baseline indicated deterioration and negative change indicated improvement.</description>
        <time_frame>Baseline, Cycles 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9, 14, End of Treatment, Follow-up Month 6, Follow-up Month 12, Follow-up Month 18</time_frame>
        <population>The Patient Reported Outcome (PRO) Population includes participants with both a baseline assessment and at least one post-baseline assessment in any PRO items. The variation of the number of participants in the table reflects the number of participants with corresponding scores at the given visits and at baseline.</population>

        <title>Time to Clinically Meaningful Deterioration in the Global Health Status/ Quality of Life and Functional (Physical, Role, and Cognitive) Subscales of the QLQ-C30 From First HER2-Targeted Treatment</title>
        <description>The time to clinically meaningful deterioration in the global health status/HRQoL subscale (question 29 and 30 of the QLQ-C30) was used to assess the time from first HER2-targeted treatment to worsening in HRQoL. Clinically meaningful deterioration is defined as a decrease in score of 10 points in Physical functioning and HRQoL; decrease of 7 points in Cognitive functioning, and decrease of 14 points in Role functioning.</description>
