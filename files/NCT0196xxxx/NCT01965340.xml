    <textblock>
      Sepsis is the major cause of morbidity and mortality amongst burn patients. Burn shock and&#xD;
      respiratory failure that used to be the major cause of mortality have progressively been&#xD;
      replaced by sepsis and multiple organ failure. It is not rare that treatment failures occurs&#xD;
      several weeks, or even months after injury as a consequence of sepsis usually caused by&#xD;
      multi-drug resistant (MDR) microorganisms. Introduction of early surgery combined with&#xD;
      topical and systemic antibiotherapy dramatically enhanced survival from sepsis after burn&#xD;
      trauma, but further improvement is impaired by the rapid development of hard-to-treat MDR&#xD;
      bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Correct prescription of anti-infective agents could be one way to curb the steadily&#xD;
      increasing development of multidrug resistance. Administration of antibiotic to burn patient&#xD;
      is complex: they frequently suffer from kidney dysfunction, they usually experience&#xD;
      tremendous shifts of liquids between intra-vascular - inter-cellular and intra-cellular&#xD;
      compartments, they often are hypo-albumin and protein-emic, and finally they present with a&#xD;
      profoundly modified metabolism. All those aspects make this particular population of patients&#xD;
      at high risk of both under or over prescription.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of drug concentrations in the plasma of patients, so-called TDM for Therapeutic&#xD;
      Drug Monitoring, has been introduced to clinical practice for several decades primarily to&#xD;
      avoid toxicity of a small number of drugs with narrow therapeutic windows. However, with the&#xD;
      increasing availability of detection techniques, the number of drugs that can be measured in&#xD;
      the plasma of patients has grown tremendously over the last decade. As a consequence, it is&#xD;
      currently possible to monitor drug concentrations not only to prevent toxicity, but also to&#xD;
      improve efficacy. For instance, several studies demonstrated that TDM improved antibiotic&#xD;
      prescription in different populations of hospitalized patients, including critically ill&#xD;
      patients, with a direct impact on outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such studies amongst burn patients are however lacking, although this particular population&#xD;
      is at high risk to suffer from mis-prescription. We thus hypothesize that systematic TDM&#xD;
      could improve antibiotic prescription in this peculiar population. To this end, we propose to&#xD;
      implement a 3-year prospective, randomized, mono-centric, clinical trial that will analyze&#xD;
      the impact of systematic TDM on anti-infective agent prescription amongst burned patients.&#xD;
