  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a pilot, designed to provide data regarding the feasibility and acceptability of&#xD;
      conducting such a study on a larger scale. The present study is a randomized controlled&#xD;
      clinical trial comparing two programs to help people manage diabetes and lose weight, one&#xD;
      using a moderate-carbohydrate diet promoted by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) and&#xD;
      the other using on a low-carbohydrate diet (LC) and mindfulness and positive affect lifestyle&#xD;
      modifications. Intervention content will include information about nutrition (American&#xD;
      Diabetes Association recommended diet or carbohydrate restriction) and, in the LC group,&#xD;
      emotion regulation, positive affect, and mindful eating strategies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Approximately individuals with type 2 diabetes will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to treatment&#xD;
      groups. Classes will occur online. Participants will be evaluated at 0, 16, and 32 weeks. Our&#xD;
      main outcome of interest is HbA1c (glycated hemoglobin, a measure indicative of blood glucose&#xD;
      levels and tied to diabetes severity).&#xD;

    <description>Participants in the American Diabetes Association (ADA) diet group will receive standard ADA advice. The diet includes high-fiber foods (such as vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes), low-fat dairy products, fresh fish, and foods low in saturated fat. They will be asked to use the &quot;plate method&quot; to guide their nutritional choices.</description>
  </arm_group>
  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Low Carbohydrate Diet</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants will be instructed to follow a low carbohydrate, ketogenic diet: carbohydrate intake 20-35 grams a day not including fiber. Foods permitted include: meats, poultry, fish, eggs, cheese, cream, some nuts and seeds, green leafy vegetables, and most other non-starchy vegetables. Because most individuals self-limit caloric intake, no calorie restriction will be recommended.&#xD;
Participants will also be taught information about mindfulness and positive affect practices. The mindfulness-based curriculum will focus on the following elements: training on topics such as mindful meditation, mindful eating, awareness of fullness and hunger signals, and taste satiety. The positive emotion curriculum will include: training on topics such as noticing and savoring positive events, gratitude, positive reappraisal, personal strengths, attainable goals, and acts of kindness.</description>
