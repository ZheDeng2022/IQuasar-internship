      The Synergy Trial will evaluate the safety and efficacy of a currently available medication&#xD;
      (methylphenidate) combined with a CFS-specific dietary supplement (CFS Nutrient Formula) to&#xD;
      treat Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CFS Nutrient Formula to be used in this trial is a broad-spectrum micronutrient&#xD;
      supplement that provides CFS patients with vitamins, minerals, and other cofactors (amino&#xD;
      acids, antioxidants, and mitochondrial cofactors) to complement the low-dose Central Nervous&#xD;
      System (CNS) stimulant (methylphenidate). In other words, therapeutic dosages of&#xD;
      micronutrients are provided to support the functioning of the nervous, endocrine, and immune&#xD;
      systems to a level at which a lower than customary dosage of methylphenidate can produce&#xD;
      positive clinical effects on CFS symptoms and also be well tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methylphenidate is the generic form of Ritalin®. The dose being tested in this study is&#xD;
      relatively low (5-10mg twice daily). This drug has been in clinical use for over 50 years for&#xD;
      the treatment of Narcolepsy and Attention Deficit Disorder and has a well-described safety&#xD;
      profile when used as recommended. Methylphenidate alone has been studied as a treatment for&#xD;
      CFS in the past and has been shown to produce mild benefits and be well-tolerated. When&#xD;
      provided as innovative therapy, methylphenidate plus this CFS Nutrient Formula has produced&#xD;
      substantial improvements in CFS symptoms in a limited number of patients, and demonstrated&#xD;
      excellent tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of low dose methylphenidate hydrochloride coadministered with a CFS Nutrient Formula has&#xD;
      not been previously evaluated in a controlled clinical study. The risk to patients using this&#xD;
      combination is believed to be low, especially in the context of a well-controlled clinical&#xD;
      study. Furthermore, this combination is not expected to increase the incidence or severity of&#xD;
      adverse events associated with methylphenidate hydrochloride.&#xD;
