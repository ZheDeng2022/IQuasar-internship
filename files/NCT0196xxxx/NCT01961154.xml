      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common asthma drugs, namely inhaled glucocorticoids (ICS) and long-acting beta-2&#xD;
      sympathomimetic drugs (LABA) carry a risk of adverse effects, some of which being potentially&#xD;
      severe. Therefore, current guidelines for asthma management recommend that, after a period of&#xD;
      symptom control, a reduction of the dose and cessation of the ICSs and LABAs should be&#xD;
      attempted. However, reduction in asthma medications sometimes leads to an exacerbation of&#xD;
      asthma. Therefore both physicians and asthmatics are often reluctant to reduce or stop asthma&#xD;
      medications and asthma over-medication often occurs. A test that could identify those&#xD;
      asthmatics who probably would tolerate asthma medication reduction would be useful.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether airway responsiveness to hypertonic saline can predict the&#xD;
           outcome of asthma treatment reduction in subjects with controlled asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To get an estimate about how large a proportion of Finnish asthmatic patients use their&#xD;
           medications with unnecessarily high doses or would even manage well without any asthma&#xD;
           medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Airway responsiveness to hypertonic saline can predict the outcome of asthma treatment&#xD;
           reduction&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Most of the Finnish asthmatic patients use their medications with unnecessarily high&#xD;
           doses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study in which the physician responsible for the subject management and&#xD;
      medications is blinded from the saline challenge results and the nurse performing the saline&#xD;
      challenges is blinded from medications 70 asthmatic patients with both inhaled ICS and LABA&#xD;
      will be recruited. Asthma must be well controlled (Juniper's Asthma Control Questionnaire&#xD;
      score equal or less than 0.75 ).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The asthma medications will be reduced in three steps, in six weeks' intervals, up to total&#xD;
      cessation of asthma drugs or up to asthma exacerbation. The criteria for asthma exacerbation&#xD;
      are strictly defined. First step: LABA will be discontinued. The ICS is continued. Second&#xD;
      step: medium to high daily ICS dose is reduced to low daily dose. Third step: The low ICS&#xD;
      dose will be stopped. Before each reduction, saline challenge will be performed. Asthma diary&#xD;
      is kept throughout the study and the subjects will be provided a direct telephone number to a&#xD;
      respiratory physician during all hours of day.&#xD;

      Stepping down of asthma medication in controlled asthma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal investigator:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heikki Koskela, MD. Kuopio University Hospital, Unit for Medicine and Clinical Research,&#xD;
      Division of Pulmonary Medicine&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be started during the year 2012 and will continue for 36 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Finland, asthma is the second most important disorder justifying special reimbursement of&#xD;
      asthma medication, thus causing large expenses to the society.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) are the mainstay of modern asthma therapy. When a medium-dose&#xD;
      ICS fail to achieve asthma control, they can be combined with long-acting B2-agonist&#xD;
      bronchodilators (LABA). Unfortunately, potential side effects of ICSs and LABAs are common&#xD;
      with increased frequency with increased dozing. The most common side effects of ICS are&#xD;
      benign, like sore and dry throat but also include serious adverse effects like growth&#xD;
      retardation in children and adrenal insufficiency. LABAs, in turn can increase the risks of&#xD;
      severe asthma exacerbations and even asthma-related deaths. Therefore, current guidelines for&#xD;
      asthma management recommend that, after a period of symptom control, a reduction of the dose&#xD;
      and cessation of the ICSs and LABAs should be attempted. There are two recommend strategies:&#xD;
      The international Global initiative for asthma (GINA) guideline recommends reduction of the&#xD;
      ICS dose first, with subsequent LABA cessation. On the contrary, the American Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) recommends cessation of LABAs first. In the present study we follow the&#xD;
      FDA recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At present there is limited experimental data on the optimal timing, sequence, and magnitude&#xD;
      of treatment reductions in asthma. Usually, the decision for treatment reduction is based on&#xD;
      the absence of symptoms for a certain period of time. However, even asthmatic subjects with&#xD;
      minimal symptoms may suffer from asthma exacerbation after treatment reduction. Consequently,&#xD;
      both physicians and asthmatics are often reluctant to reduce or stop asthma medications. Very&#xD;
      probably this is a major reason for the fact that a great proportion of asthmatic subjects&#xD;
      use unnecessarily high doses of asthma medications and multiple preparations. For example, in&#xD;
      Finland combination preparations containing both LABA and ICS are more commonly prescribed&#xD;
      than preparations containing only ICS (Finnish Social Insurance Institution statistics 2010).&#xD;
      Very probably many asthmatics would do well even without any asthma medications: In an&#xD;
      Italian study with stable asthmatics, all asthma medication could be stopped in 73 % of the&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There has been a great interest to find a biomarker that could identify asthmatic subjects&#xD;
      that would tolerate treatment reduction without exacerbation and those in whom the reduction&#xD;
      should not be tried. The following biomarkers have been evaluated to predict asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation after ICS dose reduction/cessation: Airway challenges with histamine, mannitol,&#xD;
      hypertonic saline, and adenosine as well as measurements of exhaled nitric oxide and sputum&#xD;
      eosinophils. In adult subjects, the hypertonic airway challenges (mannitol, hypertonic&#xD;
      saline) and the adenosine challenge have usually performed best in this respect. However,&#xD;
      none of these biomarkers have been able to predict the outcome of the ICS treatment reduction&#xD;
      accurately enough to become part of the clinical routine. To our knowledge, there are no&#xD;
      studies that have tried to predict asthma exacerbation after LABA cessation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertonic airway challenges have long been used to assess airways' tendency to constrict in&#xD;
      response to external stimuli (=airway responsiveness). Asthmatic subjects are well known to&#xD;
      be hyperresponsive to the bronchoconstrictive effect of hypertonic aerosols. During the&#xD;
      recent years we have shown that asthmatic subjects are hypersensitive also to the&#xD;
      cough-provoking effect of hypertonic aerosols. Furthermore, treatment with ICS decreases the&#xD;
      sensitivity to the cough-provoking effect of hypertonic aerosols. Among asthmatics, cough&#xD;
      responsiveness to hypertonic saline correlates closely with a well validated asthma control&#xD;
      questionnaire. The bronchoconstrictive response and the cough response to hypertonicity are&#xD;
      two separate phenomena and therefore provide additional information about the state of the&#xD;
      subject's airways. The two responses can be measured during a single challenge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cough response to hypertonic aerosols has never been evaluated whether it can predict the&#xD;
      outcome of asthma treatment reduction in subjects with stable asthma. It is possible that&#xD;
      analysis of both the bronchoconstrictive and the cough response might predict the asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation better than analysis of only one of the responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: 70 well-controlled asthmatic patients with both LABA and ICS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate whether hypertonic saline bronchoconstrictive responsiveness can predict&#xD;
           the outcome of asthma treatment reduction in subjects with stable asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate whether hypertonic saline cough responsiveness can predict the outcome of&#xD;
           asthma treatment reduction in subjects with stable asthma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To investigate whether the two responses together have a stronger predictive power than&#xD;
           the responses separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to get an estimate about how large a proportion of Finnish stable&#xD;
      asthmatic patients use their medications with unnecessarily high doses or would even manage&#xD;
      well without any asthma medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective study in which the physician responsible for the subject management and&#xD;
      medications is blinded from the saline challenge results and the nurse performing the saline&#xD;
      challenges is blinded from medications. The study includes two periods: A two-week run-in&#xD;
      period during which the subjects continue their regular asthma medications and their asthma&#xD;
      control is ensured. After that, the stepping down of the asthma medication is started and&#xD;
      continued until both ICS and LABA treatments have been stopped or until asthma exacerbation&#xD;
      has occurred. The effect of every reduction is observed for six weeks before proceeding to&#xD;
      the following step. If the medication is insufficient, an asthma exacerbation is very likely&#xD;
      to take place within this time period. In previous studies, the exacerbations have taken&#xD;
      place mean 16 - 17 days after steroid reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First step: LABA will be discontinued. The use of ICS is continued, using the same dosage,&#xD;
      preparation, and inhaler as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second step: In subjects with a daily ICS dose of more than 500 ug of beclomethasone or&#xD;
      equivalent (=&quot;medium to high dose&quot;), the ICS dose is reduced to 500 ug of beclomethasone or&#xD;
      equivalent ( = &quot;low daily dose&quot;) according to GINA, see table 1. The reduced ICS dose will be&#xD;
      administered with the same preparation and inhaler as before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third step: In subjects with a daily ICS dose of less or equal to 500 ug of beclomethasone or&#xD;
      equivalent ( = &quot;low daily dose&quot;) the ICS will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-permitted medications&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of any asthma drug apart from ICS and LABAs can be continued throughout the study.&#xD;
      However, on the study days the subject should not use any asthma drugs before the visit to&#xD;
      the outpatient clinic. All medications to other illnesses will be continued throughout the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detailed description of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1. The subject will be interviewed (nurse) and the baseline questionnaire and asthma&#xD;
      control questionnaire 19 will be filled in. The suitability of the subject for the study is&#xD;
      evaluated according to the above-mentioned criteria. Written, informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
      If skin allergy tests have not been performed before, it will be performed now. The use of&#xD;
      asthma diary is instructed. It will be used throughout the study. A two-week diary monitoring&#xD;
      with PEF values will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asthma diary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every morning and evening: The number of rescue bronchodilating drug doses taken. Three peak&#xD;
      flow (PEF) recordings before taking any asthma medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plus every morning: Awakenings at night due to asthma symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 2. The diary will be reviewed (physician). The subject will be included in the study if&#xD;
      his/her asthma is well controlled, defined as asthma control questionnaire (ACQ) score equal&#xD;
      or less than 0.75. The final ACQ score can be determined after the saline challenge since it&#xD;
      includes spirometry and forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) information is utilised&#xD;
      when calculating the ACQ score. If the subject is included, a written asthma medication&#xD;
      reduction plan is made, one copy is given to the subject and another is stored in the subject&#xD;
      file. The threshold value for significant PEF reduction is calculated (see below). The&#xD;
      subject is told about the signs and symptoms of asthma exacerbation and an action plan is&#xD;
      made. The saline challenge will be performed (nurse) as described below. The first step-down&#xD;
      in the medication is performed (LABA cessation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of asthma exacerbation, at least one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  awakening at two consecutive nights due to asthma symptoms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PEF less than 3 standard deviations from the mean PEF value obtained during the run-in&#xD;
           period on three consecutive days 20&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  bronchodilator use more than once a day on three consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  whenever the subjects feels that his/her asthma symptoms have clearly increased&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individually adjusted definition of asthma exacerbation is written in the asthma diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Action plan in case of exacerbation: The telephone numbers of the study physicians are given&#xD;
      to the subject and she/he can contact them during the office hours. The telephone number of&#xD;
      the respiratory physician in charge is given in case of an exacerbation occurring outside the&#xD;
      office hours. The exacerbation will be treated according to the standard clinical practice,&#xD;
      depending on the physician's judgement. An asthma exacerbation indicates end of the study.&#xD;
      The contacted physician informs the research nurse about the exacerbation. The nurse marks&#xD;
      down the date of exacerbation. The research nurse asks the patient to visit the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic after two weeks. The subject will visit the study physician and the permanent asthma&#xD;
      medication will be instructed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Action plan is written in the asthma diary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 3, 4 and 5. The ACQ will be filled in and the diary will be reviewed (physician). If no&#xD;
      exacerbations have occurred since the last step-down, the next step-down is made. The&#xD;
      hypertonic saline challenge will be performed (nurse). However, if the previous step-down was&#xD;
      steroid cessation, the study ends.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertonic saline challenge&#xD;
&#xD;
      This test will be performed as we have previously described with some modifications:&#xD;
      Spirometry is performed three times. After that the subject inhales isotonic&#xD;
      phosphate-buffered saline for two minutes via a high-output ultrasonic nebuliser, using tidal&#xD;
      breathing. The coughs occurring during the inhalation and two minutes after it will be&#xD;
      counted up. The number of these &quot;spontaneous&quot; coughs will be subtracted from the coughs&#xD;
      provoked by each hypertonic solution. After two minutes from the end of inhalation, the&#xD;
      spirometry will be performed twice. The better of the two recorded FEV1 values will be used&#xD;
      as the reference value when calculating the saline-induced bronchoconstriction. Subsequently,&#xD;
      they inhale hypertonic phosphate-buffered saline solutions with osmolalities of 600, 900,&#xD;
      1200, 1500, 1800 and 2100 milliosmoles (mOsm) /kg. The challenge will be stopped if either if&#xD;
      a 15 % fall in FEV1 is recorded or if the final solution has been inhaled or if the patient&#xD;
      feels severe discomfort. The cough response to saline will be calculated as the provocative&#xD;
      osmolality to induce 15 cumulative coughs. The bronchoconstrictive response will be&#xD;
      calculated as the provocative osmolality to induce 15 % fall in FEV1. If the patient feels&#xD;
      dyspnoea or if the FEV1 falls equal or more than 15 % from baseline, Ventoline Evohaler two&#xD;
      doses a 0.1 mg /Volumatic will be administered. After 15 minutes from that, spirometry will&#xD;
      be performed twice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to international studies, asthma patients often overmedicate themselves, thus being&#xD;
      exposed to unnecessary side effects and expenses. Also, due to the vast amount of asthma&#xD;
      patients, unnecessary asthma medication causes large expenses to the society. Therefore, the&#xD;
      present study is indicated. It is evident that a proportion of the subjects will experience&#xD;
      asthma exacerbation during the study. However, they have full-time contact to a respiratory&#xD;
      physician. In the study setting, the asthma medication reduction takes place in a much more&#xD;
      controlled fashion than in everyday clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A permission of the Institutional Ethics Committee has been received (Number 118//2011, dated&#xD;
      29.11.2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time table and financing&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be started during the year 2012 and will continue for 36 months. The&#xD;
      investigators seek funding from the Finnish government research funding (VTR) and from&#xD;
      private foundations.&#xD;

      Analysis of the results, publication plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will consist of three parts, one publication will be written about each.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ability of the saline challenge to predict an exacerbation after cessation of LABA&#xD;
           will be assessed by comparing the responses to saline between those who tolerated the&#xD;
           first reduction (=LABA cessation) and those who did not tolerate it, utilising unpaired&#xD;
           T-tests. Suitable cut-off values for saline responses will be sought and after that, the&#xD;
           sensitivity and specificity of the saline responses to predict an asthma exacerbation&#xD;
           after LABA cessation are defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The subjects who tolerated the LABA reduction will undergo reductions 2 and 3. The&#xD;
           ability of the saline test to predict an exacerbation after reduction/cessation of ICS&#xD;
           will be assessed by comparing the results to saline between those who tolerated the&#xD;
           second and the third reduction (= ICS reduction and ICS cessation) and those who did not&#xD;
           tolerate it, utilising unpaired T-tests. Suitable cut-off values for saline responses&#xD;
           will be sought and after that, the sensitivity and specificity of the saline responses&#xD;
           to predict an asthma exacerbation after ICS reduction are defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In addition, the proportion of the subjects who tolerated asthma medication&#xD;
           reduction/cessation will be calculated and reported.&#xD;
