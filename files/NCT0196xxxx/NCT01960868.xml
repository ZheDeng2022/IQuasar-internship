    <textblock>
      Liver transplantation is the last surgical treatment for patients with acute or chronic liver&#xD;
      disease. Transplantation therapies technics are in constant evolution. It allows an&#xD;
      increasing survivals rates and time to come back to daily activities. The postoperative&#xD;
      treatment after abdominal surgery as Liver Transplantation (LT) is usually performed in&#xD;
      Intensive Care Unit (ICU).This postoperative phase is one of the most important steps&#xD;
      regarding the involvement of the rehabilitation of the patient (Rongies 2005). Physical&#xD;
      abilities transplantation are likely to be important in the postoperative. It appears that&#xD;
      pre-transplant subjects have a weakened muscle potential, they will increase it significantly&#xD;
      in the months after transplantation with a rehabilitation program adapted (Beyer 1999).&#xD;
      Length of stay in ICU depends on surgery complications. Inactivity induced by sedation and&#xD;
      ICU length of stay are major factor for increasing complications as respiratory disorders and&#xD;
      muscle weakness. Several studies have reported feasibility and safety an early mobility&#xD;
      program in ICU, especially regarding the length of stay decrease (Bailey 2007; Morris 2008;&#xD;
      Schweickret 2009, Needham 2010; Bourdin 2010) These early mobility programs encompass muscle&#xD;
      strength assessment, passive range of motion, active mobility, sitting on the edge of bed,&#xD;
      standing and walking, which would be related to the primary disease of LT (Rongies 2008). The&#xD;
      assessment of the strength for ICU patient is feasible and reproducible with the Medical&#xD;
      Research Council score (MRC score). The MRC score consists in an assessment of three muscle&#xD;
      groups of upper and lower limbs. Sitting positions and verticalization are included in&#xD;
      programs begun as soon as possible after surgery evaluation of the response level to verbal&#xD;
      stimulation and physical abilities (Gosselink 2011). The skills of the physiotherapist are&#xD;
      established in legal texts making him a key in the assessment and management of these&#xD;
      patients on musculoskeletal and respiratory domains.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to validate data feasibility and tolerance. Another aim is also&#xD;
      to assess the length of stay in ICU, of early mobility and physical program, started in the&#xD;
      postoperative period in a population of patients with liver transplantation, during their&#xD;
      stay in ICU of Prof. Albanese. Thus, we decided to carry out a parallel study, open,&#xD;
      randomized monocentric comparing two groups of patient liver transplanted. The control group&#xD;
      will receive the standard treatment used in the ICU and the experimental group will receive a&#xD;
      protocol of early mobilization according to data from recent literature on the subject. The&#xD;
      study is scheduled to last over one year and included patients will receive physical therapy&#xD;
      on five days a week with a frequency of one to several times per day depending on the&#xD;
      clinical requirements or conditions of the study.&#xD;
