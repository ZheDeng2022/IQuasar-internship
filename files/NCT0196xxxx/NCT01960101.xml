  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dry mouth is in most cases due to iatrogenic causes, particularly drugs. The existing&#xD;
      products such as saliva substitutes are often disappointing (bad taste, poor efficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis has considered the &quot;empirical&quot; observations made by some patients with&#xD;
      xerostomia who consumed milk products to relieve the dry mouth syndrome from which they&#xD;
      suffered. With this clinical observation, a closer collaboration has been undertaken with&#xD;
      research laboratories specialising in food and especially milk. Through its composition, the&#xD;
      dairy product in itself provides relief for the patient, due both to its physical and&#xD;
      biochemical properties, which could explain these observed improvements, and elements related&#xD;
      to the phenomena of consumption of food as an alternative to medication. In the latter,&#xD;
      hedonism takes on a role which has not been previously assessed. Initial work undertaken with&#xD;
      the department of applied research at the National Dairy Industry School (ENIL) led to the&#xD;
      prototyping of a new natural milk, which is the subject of this application for development,&#xD;
      to qualify and adapt a product with a &quot;health benefit&quot; in patients suffering from xerostomia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further develop this project we will initiate a sequential clinical trial by groups of&#xD;
      five ambulatory patients with xerostomia (patients taking antidepressants followed in&#xD;
      psychiatry appointments). The clinical tests will be organised by the CIC with the&#xD;
      psychiatric wards of the University Hospital of Besançon. Each group of 5 patients will test&#xD;
      a similar product for 14 days. The information collected after a series of tests with a group&#xD;
      of patients will be translated by changing the ENIL specifications to produce a new&#xD;
      mini-series of products. This repetition will be carried out up to 3 times if necessary to&#xD;
      help achieve a satisfactory product in terms of taste, texture and lubrication properties,&#xD;
      which will then be tested in a randomized controlled cross-over study of the efficiency and&#xD;
      acceptability of the new &quot;LactoXeros&quot; product versus a reference product (Aequasyal ®,&#xD;
      Oxidized Glycerol Triester) on a group of 32 patients at the University hospital of Dijon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A natural way to combat xerostomia at the interface of patient diet, such as we propose,&#xD;
      could help improve quality of life for patients, minimize harmful effects (infection, decay)&#xD;
      and promote adherence of patients to treatments which are responsible for xerostomia.&#xD;

    <description>The mouth dryness score will be evaluated using a visual analogical scale (scale increased from 0 to 10 cm). The value 0 refers to normal mouth dampness (absence of dry mouth symptoms) and value 10 represents &quot;the worst imaginable&quot; dry mouth symptoms. This score is specific, sensitive and reproducible</description>

    <description>The oral examination will be performed by a dentist. During the inspection, the Silness Loe plaque index will be measured. The appearance of the oral tissue (redness, dryness) will be assessed using an ordinal 4-point scale as follows: 0 = none, 1 mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe</description>

    <description>Patients will take the oral spray for 14 days. The Aequasyal ® Oral Spray is a solution of oxidized glycerol triesters. The oral spray is applied by spraying on the inside of each cheek, 3-4 times per day. After each administration, users are instructed to gently spread the product around the mouth with the tongue. The Aequasyal ® Oral Spray is a Class I medical device, and is CE-marked.</description>
