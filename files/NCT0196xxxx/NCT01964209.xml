    <textblock>
      This proposal is to evaluate the reliability and validity of the Vanderbilt ADHD screening&#xD;
      tool for use with adolescents and young adults aged 13-21 years. The Vanderbilt is a&#xD;
      previously developed, freely available set of parent- and teacher-report questionnaires&#xD;
      designed to identify ADHD and related disorders in children. The Vanderbilt measures have&#xD;
      been chosen for inclusion in the new computerized Integrated Clinical Information Sharing&#xD;
      System (ICISS) being rolled out in five Boston Children's Hospital (BCH)&#xD;
      departments/divisions (Adolescent/Young Adult Practice, Children's Hospital Primary Care&#xD;
      Center, Developmental Medicine Center, Department of Neurology, Department of Psychiatry).&#xD;
      The Vanderbilt was developed and validated for use among children up to age 12 years&#xD;
      (Wolraich et al., 2003; Wolraich et al., 2013; Bard et al., 2013), and little is known about&#xD;
      its appropriateness for use among older youth. In addition, there is no self-report version&#xD;
      of the Vanderbilt that can be administered directly to adolescents and young adults (ages&#xD;
      13-21 years), for whom parents and teachers are often less knowledgeable reporters. To&#xD;
      address these shortcomings, a multidisciplinary team of BCH adolescent health clinicians and&#xD;
      researchers modified the parent and teacher Vanderbilt questionnaires to make them&#xD;
      age-appropriate for adolescents and young adults and created a complementary self-report&#xD;
      version for adolescents and young adults. The goal of the current study is to 1) assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of online administration through the ICISS system of the new&#xD;
      parent, teacher, and youth self-report Vanderbilt measures among adolescent and young adult&#xD;
      BCH patients aged 13-21 years; 2) test their reliability in terms of internal consistency&#xD;
      reliability, temporal stability of responses over a one-month test-retest, and inter-rater&#xD;
      agreement across all informants (parents, teachers, and youths); and 3) test their validity&#xD;
      by evaluating their convergence with a similar set of ADHD screening tools, the Conners&#xD;
      scales, already validated for use with adolescents and young adults.&#xD;

      Background and Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: We will use the ICISS system's capacity for prospective and ongoing collection&#xD;
      of data from enrolled patients and their families to conduct our prospective, longitudinal&#xD;
      study consisting of a baseline assessment at enrollment into ICISS, a one-month re-test&#xD;
      assessment, and a follow-up assessment at either 3 months for patients who were&#xD;
      newly-diagnosed with ADHD or had a change in medication, or 6 months for patients with an&#xD;
      established diagnosis and no medication changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and Consent: Once a patient has enrolled in ICISS, they will be asked if they&#xD;
      wish to participate in the modified Vanderbilt validation study, initially by phone call.&#xD;
      Some patients and/or their parents will want to discuss this in person or may not be reached&#xD;
      by phone call, in which case the research assistant will meet with them at the clinic visit.&#xD;
      This will take place in a quiet, confidential space.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, with adolescents it is typical that the parent is not present at the clinic visit.&#xD;
      The Vanderbilt validation study will then be discussed with the parent verbally by phone and&#xD;
      consent will be implicit in answering the two Conners questionnaires when sent online.&#xD;
      Interested and eligible patients will be reminded in this email that participation in this&#xD;
      research study is completely voluntary, that a decision not to participate will not affect&#xD;
      their medical care in any way and that they may withdraw from the study at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As participation in this study consists simply of answering two Conners questionnaires which&#xD;
      represent the standard of care for ADHD both nationally and in our clinics, presents&#xD;
      virtually no risk to the participant above the minimal risks associated with the general&#xD;
      ICISS study, and the parent, participant and teacher all have the option to simply not&#xD;
      respond to the email requesting Conners completion for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection and Measures: The increase in effort to collect the additional data needed&#xD;
      for our study will be small as most of these measures are already being collected as part of&#xD;
      the larger ICISS implementation. The added time for each participant to complete the Conners&#xD;
      measures is marginal, on the order of 30 minutes total over a few interactions. After&#xD;
      enrollment into ICISS, all eligible patients aged 13-21 years will be asked to complete the&#xD;
      baseline youth self-report Vanderbilt-Long Form questionnaire and their parents the Parent&#xD;
      version. In addition, patients 13-18 years will have teachers complete the Teacher version.&#xD;
      All Long-Form versions include 18 items assessing the frequency (using a response scale of&#xD;
      0=Never, 1=Occasionally, 2=Often, 3=Very often) of symptoms and behaviors indicative of the&#xD;
      predominant subtype of ADHD (Inattentive, Hyperactive/Impulsive, or Combined). Additionally,&#xD;
      all three versions screen for Anxiety/Depression (7 items) and Oppositional-Defiant Disorder&#xD;
      (8 items), disorders that often co-occur with ADHD. Lastly, only the Parent and Teacher&#xD;
      versions include items assessing Conduct Disorder and School Performance (e.g., academic&#xD;
      performance, peer relations, classroom behavior, and assignment completion). To assess&#xD;
      test-retest reliability, we will again administer the Long-Forms at one-month follow-up.&#xD;
      However, for subsequent follow-ups (i.e., 3- or 6-months), we will administer the Short-Form&#xD;
      for all three Vanderbilt measures, which is the Long-Form but with the omission of&#xD;
      Anxiety/Depression and Oppositional-Defiant disorder items. We will also collect the&#xD;
      following data to address each of our study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Feasibility and Acceptability: We will record patient, parent, and teacher response&#xD;
      and completion rates for each Vanderbilt administration. We will also measure the length of&#xD;
      time it takes for them to complete the Long Form (administered at baseline and one-month&#xD;
      follow-up) and Short Form (administered monthly thereafter), and provide comment fields so&#xD;
      that they can describe any difficulties they may have had in answering any of the questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Test-Retest and Inter-Rater Reliability: All patients, parents, and teachers will&#xD;
      again receive their respective Long-Form version of the Vanderbilt at one-month follow-up. As&#xD;
      part of the ICISS system, they will receive an email prompting them to complete the forms and&#xD;
      submit them electronically to ICISS where they will be made available to the team and the&#xD;
      patient's clinician. We will examine test-retest only for those patients who had no new&#xD;
      medications or changes in their medications and stable symptoms during the intervening month.&#xD;
      We will use the following two items to identify these patients: 1) &quot;Since your/your child's&#xD;
      last medical appointment in the Adolescent Practice, have there been any changes in&#xD;
      your/his/her ADHD-related medications or therapies?&quot; (Yes, No, I/My child do/does not receive&#xD;
      ADHD-related medications or therapies); and 2) &quot;In general, how would you describe your/your&#xD;
      child's ADHD symptoms since your/his/her last medical appointment in the Adolescent&#xD;
      Practice?&quot; (They have improved, They have stayed about the same, They have gotten worse). We&#xD;
      will only include patients for whom both the parent and patient reports indicate no changes&#xD;
      in symptoms or medications/therapies. We will examine both item-level retest agreement as&#xD;
      well as reliability of the overall screening outcome within each Vanderbilt domain (e.g.,&#xD;
      whether criteria are met for ADHD [and the predominant subtype], Oppositional-Defiant&#xD;
      Disorder, Anxiety/Depression, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also examine, when data are available, the level of &quot;inter-rater&quot; agreement, at the&#xD;
      domain level, across screening results obtained from youth, parent, and teacher forms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Concurrent and Known-Groups Validity: For patients ages 13-18 years, we will&#xD;
      administer concurrent with the Vanderbilt at all assessment time points (see Study Design),&#xD;
      the Conners 3rd Edition Self Report Scale - Short Form (39 items); the Parent Rating Scale&#xD;
      (43 items); and the Teacher Rating Scale (39 items). For patients ages 19-21 yrs, we will&#xD;
      administer the Conners Adult ADHD Rating Scale Self-Report - Screening Version (30 items),&#xD;
      and ask parents to complete the corresponding Observer Report - Screening Version (30 items)&#xD;
      (Erhardt et al, 1999; Van Voorhees et al., 2011). We opted to use the adult ADHD rating&#xD;
      scales for patients aged 19 years or older since the Conners 3rd Edition measures have only&#xD;
      been validated up to age 18 years. We also opted to drop the teacher-based assessment for&#xD;
      patients older than 18 years due to concern that many teachers would be unable to assess&#xD;
      participants given minimal personal interaction in most college classes and the participant's&#xD;
      possible desire to keep ADHD diagnosis private. To test the ability of the Vanderbilt scores&#xD;
      to differentiate adolescents who are expected to differ (known-groups validity), we will&#xD;
      administer 1) a modified version of the Clinical Global Impression Scale [CGIS], a&#xD;
      single-item measure of adolescent global functioning (Busner &amp; Targum, 2007) that parents and&#xD;
      youth both complete; 2) among patients 13-18 years, the PedsQL-Family Impact Module (Varni et&#xD;
      al., 2004) a 36-item parent-report measure of the impact a child's health condition is having&#xD;
      on parent/family quality of life; and among patients 19-21 years, the 29-item Adult ADHD&#xD;
      Quality of Life Questionnaire (AAQoL) (Matza et al., 2007). We will use these quality of life&#xD;
      and functioning measures to categorize youth into low, medium, and high symptom-severity&#xD;
      groups, and assess the ability of the Vanderbilt measures to discriminate these groups.&#xD;
      Finally, we will identify those patients who experience a change in their scores on the&#xD;
      validation measures (Conners, CGIS, PedsQL-Family Impact Module) over the follow-up period (3&#xD;
      months for newly-diagnosed or medication-change patients, 6 months for&#xD;
      established/no-medication-change patients) and assess the Vanderbilt's ability to detect that&#xD;
      change.&#xD;
