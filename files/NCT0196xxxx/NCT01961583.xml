  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Positron emission tomography (PET) is a non-invasive imaging tool for monitoring functional&#xD;
      and metabolic responses of biological events with specific radiotracer in vivo. The PET&#xD;
      tracer [18F]Fluciclatide is an 18F radiolabeled small peptide containing the RGD&#xD;
      (arginine-glycine-aspartate) tri-peptide, which preferentially binds with high affinity to&#xD;
      αvβ3 and αvβ5 integrins. αvβ3-integrins are expressed at low levels on epithelial cells and&#xD;
      mature endothelial cells but are expressed at high levels on activated endothelial cells in&#xD;
      the neo-vasculature of a range of tumors and it also may regulate angiogenesis. If pazopanib&#xD;
      acts mainly on active angiogenetic tumors, the quantitative uptake of [18F]Fluciclatide can&#xD;
      be used to predict the effect of this antiangiogenic drug. The investigators expected the&#xD;
      baseline tumor uptake in [18F]Fluciclatide to be able to predict treatment response, and&#xD;
      planned a study of [18F]FluciclatidePET for patients with metastatic RCC who received&#xD;
      pazopanib systemic therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive treatment with pazopanib at a dose of 800 mg orally once daily.&#xD;
      [18F]Fluciclatide imagings will be taken 2 times; 1) before systemic therapy (at baseline),&#xD;
      2) at one week after starting of Pazopanib. However, If the target lesion on the baseline PET&#xD;
      cannot be discriminated compared to the background activity, the 2nd PET will not be done.&#xD;
      Response evaluation by CT will be performed at baseline, at 6 week, at 12 week and every 8&#xD;
      weeks thereafter until the end of treatment. RECIST1.1 criteria for response will be applied.&#xD;
      Patient will be treated with Pazopanib until there is disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity or withdrawal of patient consent.&#xD;
