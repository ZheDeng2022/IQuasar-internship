      D961H 20 mg (D961H sachet 20 mg) is bioequivalent to a commercial HPMC capsule of D961H 20 mg&#xD;
      (D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg) after repeated oral doses by the assessment of percentage of time&#xD;
      with intragastric pH&gt;4 during 24 hours after dose on Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare a D961H sachet 20 mg with a D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg after repeated oral doses by&#xD;
      the assessment of percentage of time with intragastric pH&gt;3 during 24 hours and 24-hour&#xD;
      median pH after dose on Day 5&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare PK properties of a D961H sachet 20 mg with those of D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg after&#xD;
      repeated oral doses by the assessment of AUCτ, Cmax,ss, AUC0-t,ss, MRT, tmax,ss, and t1/2,ss&#xD;
      of esomeprazole after dose on Day 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of a D961H sachet 20 mg and D961H HPMC capsule 20 mg&#xD;
