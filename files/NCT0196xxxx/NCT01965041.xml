  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Adult-onset vitelliform detachments associated with pattern dystrophy is a genetic disorder&#xD;
      that carries visual implications that most commonly affect the macula (area in the eye near&#xD;
      the retina that is essential for sharp central vision). Adult onset vitelliform detachments&#xD;
      have an accumulation of material on the outer retina. Over time, the abnormal accumulation of&#xD;
      this material can damage cells that are critical for clear central vision. As a result,&#xD;
      people with this disorder often lose their central vision, and their eyesight may become&#xD;
      blurry or distorted.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subretinal fluid is thought to play a role in the formation of vitelliform detachments, which&#xD;
      are associated with progressive vision loss. Fluid in the subretinal space disrupts the&#xD;
      physical apposition between photoreceptor outer segments and retinal pigment epithelial&#xD;
      cells, which may in turn hinder the phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor outer segments.&#xD;
      Material derived from the unphagocytized outer segments may accumulate in the subretinal&#xD;
      space to form vitelliform lesions, resulting in a persistent detachment. Anti-VEGF therapy in&#xD;
      the form of intravitreal aflibercept injections may be useful in controlling or eliminating&#xD;
      subretinal fluid, thus promoting contact between photoreceptor outer segments and the retinal&#xD;
      pigment epithelium. Vitelliform detachments may resolve subsequent to the removal of&#xD;
      subretinal fluid and restoration of contact-dependent mechanisms of photoreceptor outer&#xD;
      segment recycling.&#xD;
