  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with stable coronary disease when undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention may&#xD;
      present periprocedural myocardial infarction defined at present as a creatine&#xD;
      kinase-myocardial isoenzyme (CK-MB) elevation 3 times upper limit of normal, as a cut off for&#xD;
      periprocedural myocardial infarction after PCI. Although percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      is associated with low rates of complications, periprocedural myocardial infarction has been&#xD;
      touted as a negative factor in long-term clinical results . Several clinical, anatomical and&#xD;
      technical associate to the occurrence of this event . Although randomized controlled trials&#xD;
      and systematic reviews to statin pre intervention have targeted the administration of&#xD;
      high-dose statin is recommended before surgery to reduce the risk of periprocedural&#xD;
      myocardial infarction, there is no information on the impact of the maximum concentration&#xD;
      plasma of statin at the time of percutaneous coronary intervention in stable patients on&#xD;
      chronic statin use in preventing periprocedural myocardial infarction or the elevation of&#xD;
      cardiac enzymes . The anti-ischemic effect of statins in percutaneous coronary intervention&#xD;
      was mainly determined in statin -na√Øve patients or in patients with acute coronary syndromes&#xD;
      . In this work , we studied the impact of the peak plasma concentration of statin at the time&#xD;
      of percutaneous coronary intervention was studied through prospective randomized single&#xD;
      center in stable patients with chronic statin divided into two groups . In the group (1)&#xD;
      Experimental (n = 268 ) was administered at a dose of 40 mg rosuvastatin between one and six&#xD;
      hours before surgery and group (2) control without rosuvastatin (n = 268). This range 1 to 6&#xD;
      hours is the time at the peak concentration of rosuvastatin in the blood after oral&#xD;
      ingestion. The primary objective was to assess the incidence of periprocedural myocardial&#xD;
      infarction by creatine kinase above three times upper normal limit in hospital period and as&#xD;
      a secondary objective to analyze the elevation of any amount of creatine kinase on the&#xD;
      baseline.&#xD;
