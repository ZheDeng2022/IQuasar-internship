  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spondyloarthritis refers to a set of inflammatory disorders that mainly afflict the spine,&#xD;
      joints and ligaments. A subtype of spondyloarthritis is Ankylosing Spondylitis - now known as&#xD;
      axial spondyloarthropathy - which is characterized by inflammation of the joints in the&#xD;
      spinal column, and the part of the back where the spine meets the pelvis. Another subtype of&#xD;
      spondyloarthritis is Psoriatic Arthritis where patients often develop raised patches of&#xD;
      reddened skin. The disease can advance to one of more joints in the body resulting in pain,&#xD;
      swelling and stiffness. These forms of inflammatory arthritis can become chronic and over&#xD;
      time can lead to pain, disability and deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is now evidence that patients with inflammatory arthritis that are diagnosed and&#xD;
      treated earlier in the course of their symptoms may have better results. Yet although we know&#xD;
      that early treatment is important, the investigators still don't know if there are factors&#xD;
      that can predict how an individual patient's disease will progress over time in terms of&#xD;
      losing mobility. The investigators also do not know the relationship between loosing mobility&#xD;
      and the formation of bone around the spine and joints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are doing this study because the investigators want to learn more about&#xD;
      patients with these forms of arthritis - Ankylosing Spondylitis and Psoriatic Arthritis. The&#xD;
      investigators want to learn more about the factors that can predict how their disease might&#xD;
      progress over time and what their response to treatment might be. The investigators would&#xD;
      also like to determine the proportion of patients with these types of symptoms and describe&#xD;
      the best treatment strategies for them.&#xD;

      The condition to be studied is Spondyloarthritis (SpA). The investigators will gather a&#xD;
      cohort of patients with variants of SpA (n = 70), including Ankylosing Spondylitis (AS) and&#xD;
      Psoriatic Arthritis (PsA) who have axial disease and fully characterize disease activity.&#xD;
      Care guidelines suggest that these patients are seen at least twice within the first year&#xD;
      with annual visits thereafter. Radiographs are desirable to assess disease progression, but&#xD;
      are not always required. Treatment options for both PsA and AS patients include non-steroidal&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), steroid injections, disease modifying anti rheumatic drugs&#xD;
      (DMARDs) and biologics (i.e. tumor necrosis factor inhibitors aka TNF inhibitors or TNFi's).&#xD;
      The cohort of patients eligible for enrollment in this study would be those patients who for&#xD;
      the preceding 6 weeks have not received biologic treatment such as infliximab,and who for the&#xD;
      preceding 4 weeks have not received biologic treatments such as adalimumab,&#xD;
      etanercept,golimumab, certolizumab pegol and other biologic therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated 4 times over two years: at enrollment, 24 weeks, 52 weeks and 104&#xD;
      weeks (with a 12 week window around each visit). Usual care for patients with SpA would&#xD;
      include regular assessments of pain, function and mobility, assessments of spine and joint&#xD;
      motion, joint swelling and tenderness with treatment changes at each follow up visit to&#xD;
      reduce pain, improve function, address adverse events to medications and enhance spinal&#xD;
      mobility. Interventions might include physical therapy, analgesics, NSAIDs, DMARDs or&#xD;
      biologic therapies. The investigator would not assign specific interventions to the subjects&#xD;
      of the study. All of this would be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific clinical information will be gathered at each visit using validated indexes and data&#xD;
      collection instruments, including disease activity [using the Bath AS Disease Activity Index&#xD;
      (BASDAI) and Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Score (ASDAS)], function (using the Bath&#xD;
      AS Functional Index (BASFI), measure joint/ligament involvement, measuring tender and swollen&#xD;
      joint counts, dactylitis, enthesitis (as quantified using the Spondyloarthritis Research&#xD;
      Consortium of Canada (SPARCC) enthesitis index and spine involvement (measured as range of&#xD;
      movement in the spine and hips using the Bath AS Metrology Index (BASMI).&#xD;

    <description>(a) A secondary outcome will be the difference in peripheral blood IL-23R levels in patients whose ASDAS improves by at least 1.1 over 1 year and will be measured at the end of the first year and again at the end of the two-year study period. These patients will be referred to as &quot;responders&quot; to usual care. (We will also look at changes in level of IL-23R over 2 years in responders vs. non responders). A change of at least 1.1 is the minimally clinically important difference.&#xD;
b) We will evaluate the correlation of other immune modulators and inflammatory cytokines such as, TNF, IL-1, IL-6, IL-17, IL-22, and IL-21 and disease activity in patients who are followed serially with standard disease activity measures (ASDAS, BASDAI), function (BASFI), and enthesitis (MASES)(1, 2).</description>
