      To compare the efficacy and safety of ASP3550 to goserelin acetate in patients with prostate&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study consists of two parts. The purpose of PART 1 is to test non-inferiority of ASP3550&#xD;
      to goserelin acetate with respect to the cumulative castration rate in terms of serum&#xD;
      testosterone when ASP3550 or goserelin acetate is administered for one-year in patients with&#xD;
      prostate cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients assigned to receive ASP3550 and completed the treatment in PART 1 are eligible&#xD;
      for the treatment in PART 2, and will receive ASP3550 maintenance dose subcutaneously for&#xD;
      additional term. The long-term safety, efficacy and PK of the continued ASP3550 treatment&#xD;
      will be assessed in PART 2.&#xD;

             prostatectomy or radiotherapy with curative intention and has a rising serum PSA (PSA&#xD;
             ≥ 2 ng/mL at screening) may be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a serum testosterone level above 2.2 ng/mL at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) Performance Status (PS) score of 0 to&#xD;
             2 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a serum PSA ≥ 2 ng/mL at screening.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous or present endocrine treatment for prostate cancer. Example: surgical&#xD;
             castration, GnRH agonists, GnRH antagonists, antiandrogens or oestrogens, and&#xD;
             5α-reductase inhibitors.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Is a candidate for curative therapy, i.e., radical prostatectomy or radiotherapy&#xD;
             within 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has concurrent or a history of poorly controlled severe asthma, anaphylactic&#xD;
             reactions, severe urticaria or angioedema.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has hypersensitivity towards mannitol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a marked prolongation of QT/QTc interval (two consecutive increases to &gt;450 ms in&#xD;
             QTc interval at retest) at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has concurrent or a history of a disease (heart failure, hypokalemia, a family history&#xD;
             of QT prolongation syndrome, etc.) that may induce Torsade de Pointes.&#xD;
