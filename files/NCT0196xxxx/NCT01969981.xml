  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, observational study. Patients who require a Peripheral&#xD;
      Inserted Central Catheters (PICC) will constitute the study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to determine whether Sherlock 3CG, is adequate means for the&#xD;
      total placement of PICC and confirmation of tip of PICC placement and if this method can be&#xD;
      conducted safely and efficiently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be included during a 6-month period as well as they are ambulatory or&#xD;
      hospitalized. The patient's routine care will not be modified and only PICC will be assessed&#xD;
      in the present study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PICC placement will be performed using the Site Rite guidance and tip position will be&#xD;
      confirmed using the Sherlock 3CG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedure is the same as the routine habits of the operator (nurse or anesthesiologist);&#xD;
      the vascular access team already uses the previous device for CVC placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients won't be followed up in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Our current Central Venous Catheter placement protocol for PICC includes the resort to&#xD;
      UltraSonography (US) and requires fluoroscopy and plain radiographies throughout the PICC&#xD;
      insertion and until the confirmation of best placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This verification is mandatory to avoid the risks, delays and costs of repositioning the tip,&#xD;
      but obtaining a fluoroscopy and plain radiographies in operating rooms can be time consuming&#xD;
      and exposes the patient, nurses and physicians to radiations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of endocavitary electrocardiogram for tip position confirmation has been developed&#xD;
      since 1985 and is now recognized as an alternative method. It has been recognized as the best&#xD;
      technique in other indications, such as hemodialysis. It helps to position PICC tip in&#xD;
      proximity to the cavoatrial junction. In Europe, Italian and German teams already use this&#xD;
      new method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A new ultrasound machine offering external sensors and Endocavitary ECG guide is now&#xD;
      available (Site Rite and Sherlock 3CG - Tip Confirmation System), which allows the&#xD;
      installation and proper placement in the same operation. This Sherlock 3CG TCS has already&#xD;
      been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the US and is indicated for PICC tip&#xD;
      placement confirmation in adult patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This new ECG guidance method will allow the PICC insertion without any radiation in the&#xD;
      operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the moment, according to the local recommendations, French patients will have to continue&#xD;
      to perform one post-procedural X-ray to confirm tip position. This exam will be performed in&#xD;
      a dedicated room of the radiology unit. But guidance and confirmation of CVC placement only&#xD;
      by ECG may provide a faster means of confirmation and eliminates radiation exposure to the&#xD;
      patients, nurses and anesthesiologists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, it would eliminate the costs associated with confirmatory chest X-ray (exam&#xD;
      costs and time consumption).&#xD;
