    <textblock>
      This phase I/II trial studies the side effects and best dose of ganetespib when given&#xD;
      together with paclitaxel and to see how well they work in treating patients with recurrent&#xD;
      ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer. Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as&#xD;
      paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells or by stopping them from dividing. Ganetespib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving paclitaxel and ganetespib may be&#xD;
      an effective treatment for ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the recommended Phase II dose of ganetespib with weekly paclitaxel. (Phase I)&#xD;
      II. Probability of surviving progression-free for at least 6 months after initiating therapy.&#xD;
      (Phase II) III. Clinical response rate (partial and complete responses as defined by Response&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors [RECIST] 1.1 criteria). (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of ganetespib and weekly paclitaxel in this&#xD;
      cohort of patients as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse reactions. (Phase I)&#xD;
      II. Determine the nature and degree of toxicity of ganetespib and weekly paclitaxel in this&#xD;
      cohort of patients as measured by the frequency and severity of adverse reactions&#xD;
      encountered. (Phase II) III. Duration of progression-free survival. (Phase II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a phase I, dose-escalation study of ganetespib followed by a phase II study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive paclitaxel intravenously (IV) over 1 hour and ganetespib IV over 1 hour on&#xD;
      days 1, 8, and 15. Courses repeat every 28 days in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
