  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity is one prominent health-protective behaviour which might increase&#xD;
      with the help of self-regulatory strategies such as action planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this randomised controlled trial is to examine changes in daily moderate physical&#xD;
      activity in couples following (a) a dyadic planning intervention, (b) an individual planning&#xD;
      intervention or (c) a no-planning control condition. Changes in daily physical activity will&#xD;
      be examined over a period of one year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is assumed that target persons from couples receiving a dyadic planning intervention will&#xD;
      show greater increases in daily physical activity than target persons from couples receiving&#xD;
      an individual planning intervention. For couples receiving a dyadic planning intervention or&#xD;
      an individual planning intervention, it is hypothesized that target persons will show higher&#xD;
      increases in daily physical activity than target persons from couples participating in the&#xD;
      no-planning control condition.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Regular physical activity reduces the risk of a number of grave chronic diseases, including&#xD;
      many forms of cancer. Guidelines indicate that increasing moderate physical activity by 30 to&#xD;
      60 minutes on at least 5 days of the week should already be associated with such significant&#xD;
      health benefits. However, recent epidemiologic information indicates that only about 20% of&#xD;
      the German adult population fully meet this important health behaviour goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this relatively moderate recommended increase in physical activity and an apparently&#xD;
      high acceptance of goals to increase moderate daily physical activity, many people fall short&#xD;
      of goal achievement, as the implementation and maintenance of behaviour change often fails.&#xD;
      Therefore, aside from enhancing motivational factors, interventions promoting&#xD;
      health-behaviour change (e.g., increase in physical activity), are now commonly extended to&#xD;
      address volitional strategies, such as action planning. Action planning aids individuals in&#xD;
      translating their goals into behaviour. By forming action plans, individuals link situational&#xD;
      cues ('when' and 'where' specifications of critical situations) to behavioural responses&#xD;
      ('what to do' or 'how to act') in an 'if-then'-format. Available findings suggest that action&#xD;
      planning aside from its direct effects on behaviour change, including increase in physical&#xD;
      activity, also fosters other self-regulation strategies that are effective in the&#xD;
      implementation and maintenance of changes in health-related behaviour. Research on action&#xD;
      planning so far mainly focuses on its benefits for the individual's self-regulation of&#xD;
      behaviour. To date there is little evidence on the role of the close social environment in&#xD;
      planning health-behaviour change. However, married and cohabiting individuals often try to&#xD;
      and succeed in coregulating their partners' health behaviour, including partners' levels of&#xD;
      physical activity. Therefore, in the proposed study, an extension of individual action&#xD;
      planning to the level of the dyad, i.e., dyadic planning, will be examined, along with&#xD;
      associated mechanisms fit to aid the process of increasing physical activity. Dyadic planning&#xD;
      refers to creating together with a partner if-then plans on when, where and how the&#xD;
      individual target person will implement a new behaviour (e.g., be more physically active). We&#xD;
      hypothesise that dyadic planning leads to higher increases in daily physical activity when&#xD;
      compared to individual planning or no planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the proposed randomised controlled trial, we will compare changes in daily moderate&#xD;
      physical activity in N = 346 adults (primary outcome) and their partners who receive a&#xD;
      general motivational treatment to enhance daily physical activity and are then randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of three intervention conditions: (a) a dyadic planning intervention, in&#xD;
      which target persons form action plans to increase daily physical activity together with&#xD;
      their partners, or (b) an individual planning intervention, in which target persons form such&#xD;
      action plans individually and partners receive a distraction task, or (c) a no-planning&#xD;
      control condition, in which target persons do not receive instructions for action planning,&#xD;
      but perform a distraction task together with their partners. The study will entail an&#xD;
      experimental longitudinal design with a baseline assessment (T0), an intervention session one&#xD;
      week following baseline (T1) and follow-up assessments at 1 week (T2), 6 (T3; primary&#xD;
      endpoint), 19 (T4), 26 (T6), and 52 (T7) weeks following the main intervention session. A&#xD;
      booster intervention (T5) will take place 20 weeks after the main intervention session, i.e.&#xD;
      1 week following T4. Objective measurement of daily physical activity will include 4 one-week&#xD;
      (T0, T2, T3, T7) accelerometer assessments. Additionally, further objective measurements of&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness, BMI, and waist-to-hip ratios along with self-report assessments&#xD;
      from target persons and partners will be collected. Proposed mechanisms of the total&#xD;
      intervention effect along with covariates will be assessed mostly via self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of this study will contribute to the still limited understanding of the interplay of&#xD;
      individual and dyadic regulation in the increase of daily physical activity and its&#xD;
      maintenance, both in persons targeted by the intervention and in their partners. Findings&#xD;
      will guide further development of this economical dyadic planning intervention that can be&#xD;
      straightforwardly implemented in clinical settings to support the initiation and maintenance&#xD;
      of preventive behaviour in couples. Furthermore, this theoretically-derived dyadic planning&#xD;
      intervention can easily be extended to other domains of health-behaviour change.&#xD;

    <description>Self-reported physical activity in target persons and partners is assessed by a combination of the Office in Motion questionnaire (OIMQ; Mäder et al., 2006) complemented by items of the Physical Activity Frequency Questionnaire (PAFQ; Bernstein, Sloutiskis, Kumanyika, Sparti, Schutz, &amp; Morabia, 1998). This combined measure provides detailed information on time spent on physical activities of moderate and vigorous intensity within the past 7 days, covering the domains of transportation, occupational activity, household and yard work activities, and leisure-time physical activity.</description>
