    <textblock>
      Endovascular procedures already brought enormous revolution in the process of treatment of&#xD;
      patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). It is well defined that early mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity is significantly reduced comparing to open repair. The persistent concern is long&#xD;
      term durability of devices and their success of aneurysm exclusion in order to prevent&#xD;
      rupture. At the moment the best armament to prevent rupture after endovascular exclusion is&#xD;
      the watchful waiting and timely reintervention. The main complication that follows this&#xD;
      procedure and causing catastrophic long term complications is endoleak. The ideal algorithm&#xD;
      to follow up patients after aneurysm exclusion has not been found. In order to reveal&#xD;
      endoleak ultrasound is used more than before, however frequent computerized tomography is&#xD;
      wasting a lot of costs and exposing patients to irradiation and nephrotoxic contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Matrix metalloproteinase activity has been demonstrated in the process of aneurysm&#xD;
      development. Imbalance between MMP and its inhibitors TIMP provokes collagenolytic and&#xD;
      elastolytic activity that is inducing aneurysmatic degeneration of aortic wall. Due to the&#xD;
      previously described connection between aneurysm and MMP activity, it was proved that serum&#xD;
      level of MMP-9 is significantly higher in patients with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA).&#xD;
      Also, higher levels of MMP-9 were discovered in patients with inadequate aneurysm exclusion&#xD;
      after endovascular procedure suggesting that degradation of the aortic wall is still ongoing&#xD;
      process, not being the case with successfully excluded aneurysm. There might be a potential&#xD;
      role of MMP-9 serum level as a biomarker of present endoleak after endovascular aneurysm&#xD;
      exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All published trials have shown correlation between MMP 9 activity and presence of endoleak,&#xD;
      however, no correlation was made between specific types of endoleak and necessity to&#xD;
      reoperation (clinical significance). Additionally there were only four trials presented in&#xD;
      the literature investigating low number of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is possible value of MMP-9 serum level as biomarker of present endoleak, further&#xD;
      studies are necessary. This why we are organizing multicentre trial, that will cover&#xD;
      significant number of patients in order to define&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Value of MMP-9 as a biomarker of successful initial exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Value of MMP-9 level as predictor of aneurysm shrinkage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Value of MMP-9 level in patients with increased aneurysm diameter and no visible&#xD;
           endoleak&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlation of the MMP -9 serum level with different type of enoleak&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Value of MMP-9 as biomarker of successful treatment of endoelak&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods Patient with AAA greater then 55 mm in diameter that are candidates for&#xD;
      endovascular repair will be selected. Demographic, anatomical and data regarding the&#xD;
      procedure will be gathered prospectively. Also serum levels of MMP-9 will be measured before&#xD;
      procedure, during the first week before discharge, and after 1,6,12,18,24,36,48 months. On&#xD;
      the same day of measuring MMP-9 level control MSCT and ultrasonography exam will be performed&#xD;
      in order to collect data regarding the success of exclusion and presence of any endoleak with&#xD;
      the accurate measurement of aneurysm diameter changes. Ultrasonography and MSCT exam will be&#xD;
      performed by experienced physicians, also preoperative evaluation of anatomical data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of reintervention additional questionnaire will be filled regarding anatomical and&#xD;
      procedure related data using pre and postoperative ultrasound and MSCT examination, while&#xD;
      MMP-9 levels will be measured before procedure and after the procedure using the same&#xD;
      protocol as for primary procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysys Levels of MMP-9 in serum with presence of different types of endoleak&#xD;
      will be correlated one week and 1,6,12,18,24,36 48 months after the procedure Anatomical data&#xD;
      will be correlated with the decrease in MMP-9 level before and after procedure Levels of&#xD;
      MMP-9 in serum after one week and one month will be correlated with further aneurysm&#xD;
      shrinkage Level of MMP-9 in serum with type of endoleak will be correlated Level of MMP-9&#xD;
      before and after reoperation will be compared Level of MMp-9 in serum of patients with&#xD;
      disappearing endoleaks will be followed Level of MMP-9 in serum of patients with new&#xD;

      1. Summary&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endovascular aortic aneurysm repair (EVAR) provides low early mortality and requires&#xD;
           intensive follow up of the patients in order to prevent rupture as a consequence of&#xD;
           endoleak. Follow up protocols are changing with time differing between the hospitals and&#xD;
           even the physicians. Ultrasonography (US), contrast enhanced ultrasonography,&#xD;
           multisliced computed tomography (MSCT) and native radiography are most frequently used.&#xD;
           All these techniques are combined in order to compensate their lacks and disadvantages.&#xD;
           The new methods for early detection of endoleak should improve this cumbersome follow up&#xD;
           process.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) activity has been demonstrated in the process of aneurysm&#xD;
           development. Higher level of MMP-9 were discovered in patients with inadequate aneurysm&#xD;
           exclusion after endovascular procedure suggests that degradation of the aortic wall is&#xD;
           still ongoing process and that there might be a potential role of MMP-9 serum level as a&#xD;
           biomarker in endoleak detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Aim of this study is to explore the serum levels of MMP - 9 in patients treated with&#xD;
           endovascular aneurysm repair and to provide some more profound information regarding&#xD;
           its' correlation with different types of endoleak.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Patients treated with EVAR will be followed for at least one year. During five visits,&#xD;
           with first preoperative, then on discharge, and after one, six and twelve months,&#xD;
           patients will be examined by means of US and MSCT. During the same five visits serum&#xD;
           levels of MMP -9 will be measured and correlated with different levels of aneurysm&#xD;
           exclusion. Collected anatomical, demographic data of the patients and intraoperative&#xD;
           data related to the technical success of the procedure will provide subgroup of patients&#xD;
           with higher correlation between the aneurysm exclusion and serum level of MMP -9. The&#xD;
           primary outcome measure is the serum levels of the MMP - 9 at one, six and twelve months&#xD;
           after treatment and its relation with anatomical, demographic and procedure related&#xD;
           data. Clinical outcome events include different types of endoleak. The secondary outcome&#xD;
           is the correlation of different types of endoleak with the serum levels of the MMP - 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
           This study is designed to be multicentre and to recruit 150 patients over a 24-month&#xD;
           period. Leading center is Clinic for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery of the Serbian&#xD;
           Clinical centre. Participating center should be able to perform EVAR, follow up patient&#xD;
           with US and MSCT for four times in the first year and to detect serum levels of MMP - 9.&#xD;
           All analysis will be performed individually by participating centre encouraged to use&#xD;
           same techniques as the leading center. Individual experience of collaborators in the&#xD;
           participating centre will be recorded before their inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Endovascular procedures already brought enormous revolution in the process of treatment&#xD;
           of patient with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA). It is well defined that early mortality&#xD;
           and morbidity is significantly reduced comparing to open repair. The persistent concern&#xD;
           is long term durability of devices and their success of aneurysm exclusion in order to&#xD;
           prevent rupture. At the moment the best armament to prevent rupture after endovascular&#xD;
           exclusion is the watchful waiting and timely reintervention. The main complication that&#xD;
           follows this procedure and causing catastrophic long term complications is endoleak. The&#xD;
           ideal algorithm to follow up patients after aneurysm exclusion has not been found. In&#xD;
           order to reveal endoleak ultrasound is used more than before, however frequent&#xD;
           computerized tomography is wasting a lot of costs and exposing patients to irradiation&#xD;
           and nephrotoxic contrast.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Matrix metalloproteinase activity has been demonstrated in the process of aneurysm&#xD;
           development. Imbalance between MMP and its inhibitors TIMP provokes colagenolitic and&#xD;
           elastolytic activity that is inducing aneurysmatic degeneration of aortic wall. Due to&#xD;
           the previously described connection between aneurysm and MMP activity, it was proved&#xD;
           that serum level of MMP-9 is significantly higher in patients with abdominal aortic&#xD;
           aneurysm (AAA). Also, higher levels of MMP-9 were discovered in patients with inadequate&#xD;
           aneurysm exclusion after endovascular procedure suggesting that degradation of the&#xD;
           aortic wall is still ongoing process, not being the case with successfully excluded&#xD;
           aneurysm. There might be a potential role of MMP-9 serum level as a biomarker of present&#xD;
           endoleak after endovascular aneurysm exclusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All published trials have shown correlation between MMP 9 activity and presence of&#xD;
           endoleak, however, no correlation was made between base levels and specific types of&#xD;
           endoleak and necessity to reoperation (clinical significance). Additionally there were&#xD;
           only four trials presented in the literature investigating low number of patients&#xD;
           1,2,3,4.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aims of the trial and hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The basic research question is whether the level of MMP -9 is changing after endovascular&#xD;
      aneurysm exclusion and what is the curve of the level of active MMP-9 concentration in the&#xD;
      first year after the procedure. We hypothesize that the level of MMP-9 active concentration&#xD;
      should decline, however it might be dependent on some other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary research questions are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the role of pre-treatment serum levels of the MMP - 9 in patient with AAA? We&#xD;
           hypothesized that pre operative serum levels of the MMP - 9 should be predictor of its&#xD;
           sensitivity in endoleak detection in the postoperative follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the role of the serum levels of the MMP - 9 as a biomarker of the early&#xD;
           successful aneurysm exclusion? We hypothesize that the serum levels of the MMP - 9 in&#xD;
           the early postoperative time (first week and one month) could be biomarker of successful&#xD;
           aneurysm exclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What is the role of the serum levels of the MMP - 9 in differentiating the types of&#xD;
           endoleak? We hypothesized that different serum levels of the MMP - 9 could be found in&#xD;
           patients with different types of endoleak.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What is the role of the serum levels of the MMP - 9 after reintervetion due to a present&#xD;
           endoleak? We hypothesized that the levels of endoleak should decline after successful&#xD;
           re-treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. What is the role of the serum levels of the MMP - 9 as a predictor of aneurysm sac&#xD;
           enlargement? We hypothesized that the serum levels of the MMP - 9 in the early&#xD;
           postoperative time (up to one month) could correlate with sac enlargement in patient&#xD;
           with no visible endoleak .&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Study design 4.1. Patient enrollment and data collection The BIOLEAK study is designed to&#xD;
      become multicentre study. The minimum requirement for participation of a center in this study&#xD;
      is to perform EVAR procedures, and to have laboratory capable of the serum levels of the MMP&#xD;
      - 9 analyses. Center agreeing to collaborate should follow up patients with MSCT and&#xD;
      ultrasound for minimally four times in the first year and then at least once yearly&#xD;
      thereafter. In the same time with these follow up exams serum levels of the MMP - 9 should be&#xD;
      measured. The preferable method of the measurement is given below; however, every center is&#xD;
      encouraged to participate in the trial by using its own available method with previous&#xD;
      notification and confirmation by the leading center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study participants will undergo 5 ultrasound and 5 MSCT exams in the first year of&#xD;
      participation. Both MSCT and ultrasound should be performed before procedure, before&#xD;
      discharge after the procedure, one, six and twelve months after the procedure. All&#xD;
      preoperative anatomical and postoperative control images and ultrasound assessment should be&#xD;
      performed by the most experienced stuff of the collaborating center. Ultrasound assessment&#xD;
      should be made by Color duplex technique, widely used. MSCT image assessment should be made&#xD;
      using the post processing techniques and center line analysis. Control MSCT exams should be&#xD;
      made according to the protocol of the participating center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples to determine serum levels of the MMP - 9 as a biomarker of the aneurysm&#xD;
      exclusion should be obtained at five time points in the first year and analyzed individually&#xD;
      in the laboratory of the participating center: 1- 3 days before treatment, 2-7 days after&#xD;
      treatment, one, six and twelve months after treatment. Blood sample should be taken on the&#xD;
      same day when performing ultrasound and/or MSCT exam. Minimum requirements for participating&#xD;
      in the trial is to measure serum levels of the MMP - 9, however participating centre could&#xD;
      also include in the analysis: matrix-metalloproteinases and inhibitors (MMP-1,2,3,7,10,&#xD;
      TIMP-1). The analyzed method should be according to the capabilities of the participating&#xD;
      centre, while the leading center Clinic for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery of the Serbian&#xD;
      Clinical Centre will be measured serum MMP-9 levels with Fluorokine E (Human Active MMP-9&#xD;
      Fluorescent Assay). The process of material collection and storage was suggested by producer&#xD;
      (R&amp;D Systems).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Venous blood will be drawn via an antecubital vein puncture and collected in Heparin buffered&#xD;
      vacutainer for plasma. Exactly 30 min after collection, blood will be centrifuged (15 min,&#xD;
      1000 g, 4C) and multiple aliquots will be stored at exactly 1 h after collection at &lt; - 20 C.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One sample more from every visit should be stored for at least 12 months for additional&#xD;
      analysis if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative, discharge and one month follow up samples of each patient will be measured at&#xD;
      the same time identically in order to have same calibration and reagent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the collaborating centers: Usage of the same process of collecting and storing samples as&#xD;
      well as calculating the results will contribute to the quality of results. However, this is&#xD;
      optional condition for participating in the study and all the centers should used their own&#xD;
      methods while the leading center should be informed about the differences in this process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.2. Detailed description of the data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient with inclusion criteria will be selected and after signing consent form will be&#xD;
      included in the trial. Treating physician will report selected patient by filling the&#xD;
      inclusion form and demographic data form and sending it to the leading center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION FORM should be filled and sent to the trial center together with DEMOGRAPHIC DATA&#xD;
      FORM via fax (+381113065177). This form will include basic anatomical information regarding&#xD;
      the patient anatomy related to the success of the procedure. All data related to the&#xD;
      anatomical features of the treated aneurysm should be assessed by operating surgeon or&#xD;
      radiologists, or experienced member of the team, by using center line analysis software.&#xD;
      Extension of the aneurysm process should be defined according to the planned LZ location in&#xD;
      the iliac zone. Collateral vessels that are patent and greater than 1 mm in diameter should&#xD;
      be counted using the imaging detailed analysis. We are assuming that the number of collateral&#xD;
      vessels could influence the levels of MMP -9 in the postoperative and follow up time. Surely&#xD;
      the number of these vessels could influence the rate of endoelak type II. When filling the&#xD;
      form &quot;inferior mesenteric artery&quot; should be round off or marked with &quot;X&quot;, while the number of&#xD;
      patent lumbal, hypogastric or accessory renal arteries that are going to be excluded should&#xD;
      be stated in the blank line. Neck diameter should be measured in the inner to inner fashion,&#xD;
      while in case of non cylindrical neck the greatest value should be stated. Aneurysm length&#xD;
      should be measured from the lower renal artery to the distal end of the LZ, for the both,&#xD;
      left and right side. Neck length is defined only as a length of the fixation zone and not the&#xD;
      whole neck, which in case of long conical necks might be different. Neck configuration should&#xD;
      be assessed by center line analysis and one of the offered configurations should be chosen.&#xD;
      It is important to differ cylindrical from non cylindrical necks. Neck angulations with&#xD;
      suprarenal aorta and aneurysm sack should be measured separately. Parietal thrombus and&#xD;
      calcification should be expressed in percentage of the circumference and the greatest&#xD;
      thickness diameter should be stated. Greatest aneurysm diameter, narrowest aortic lumen and&#xD;
      lumen of the aorta at the level of bifurcation should be expressed in mm. Common iliac artery&#xD;
      diameters should be measured in three levels, the initial, middle and the distal part at the&#xD;
      level of iliac bifurcation, and should be expressed in mm. Iliac angulations should be&#xD;
      measured between the aneurysm and proximal iliac center line. Name hospital and email of the&#xD;
      corresponding physician should be stated at the end of the INCLUSION FORM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DEMOGRAPHIC DATA FORM should be sent together with INCLUSION FORM. The presence of co-morbid&#xD;
      conditions should be noted in this form, together with age, sex, previous surgical procedures&#xD;
      and active medical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After sending these forms, patient will be included in the study on the intention to treat&#xD;
      basis and corresponding physician will be informed about the PATIENT INCLUSION NUMBER. The&#xD;
      procedure should be planned the sooner the better.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE FORM should be filled to a certain extent after the procedure and the second part&#xD;
      on the discharge day. Date of the procedure and patient inclusion number should be stated.&#xD;
      Inclusion number will already sent by email from the trial center (Clinic for Vascular and&#xD;
      Endovascular Surgery, Serbian Clinical Center). Name of the operating surgeon and his&#xD;
      assistant should be stated. The configuration of the stent graft chosen and implanted should&#xD;
      be stated in the named rows (proximal stent graft diameter, distal stent graft diameter).&#xD;
      Number of used extensions should not count body and contralateral limb as a necessary&#xD;
      minimum, while aorto-uni configuration should be confirmed with &quot;yer&quot; or &quot;no&quot;. All additional&#xD;
      procedures performed in order to reduce the endoleak rate should be marked. If any additional&#xD;
      are performed it should be stated in the column left for comments. Intraoperative control&#xD;
      angio after performing total procedure should be made as common in the collaborating center,&#xD;
      and the result should be assessed by operating surgeon. If there is uncertainty with endoleak&#xD;
      type II it should be marked as probably. If operating surgeon is certain, it should be marked&#xD;
      as obvious. Other measures to reduce the endoleak probability after performing control angio&#xD;
      should be marked. The result of the angio after additional measures is not supposed to be&#xD;
      included in the procedure form, however if there are any comments they should be stated in&#xD;
      the column left for comments. On the discharge day all intrahospital postoperative&#xD;
      anticoagulant therapy should be noted, complications, outcome, additional procedures and&#xD;
      length of hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW UP FORM is designed to have data related to ultrasonogrpahy, MSCT follow up exams and&#xD;
      serum levels of MMP -9 at the all five planned visits in one place. However, since the&#xD;
      process of calculating serum levels of MMP-9 usually requires storing and gathering samples&#xD;
      until complete kit box can be used, it may cause delay in follow up completion. Additionally&#xD;
      results of the one month follow up will be objective of the interim analysis. For these&#xD;
      purposes, it is necessary to send this form via fax two times. First time is after completing&#xD;
      results for the preoperative, on discharge and one month follow up serum levels of MMP - 9&#xD;
      with ultrasound and MSCT analysis. Second time is when complete data for the one year follow&#xD;
      up are collected. During all this time this form and all others should be kept with all other&#xD;
      forms in the patients official medical documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.3. Flow chart&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five study visits will be done in each patient in the first participating year as showed in&#xD;
      the following flow-chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MMP9 ULTRASONOGRAPHY MSCT PREOPERATIVE X X X ON DISCHARGE (2-7 days) X X X ONE MONTH X X X&#xD;
      SIX MONTHS X X X ONE YEAR X X X For the purposes of central data collection, all four data&#xD;
      forms should be sent via fax to the Clinical for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery, of the&#xD;
      Serbian Clinical Centre, +381 11 30565177.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4.4. Outcome measures The primary outcome measure is the serum levels of the MMP - 9 at one,&#xD;
      six and twelve months after treatment and its relation with anatomical, demographic and&#xD;
      procedure related data. Clinical outcome events include different types of endoleak. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome is the correlation of different types of endoleak with the serum levels of&#xD;
      the MMP - 9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Safety aspects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a purely observational study and is not associated with any clinical&#xD;
      risk for complications after edovascuar aneurysm repair. About 30 ml of blood in total will&#xD;
      be drawn for serum analysis during all five visits in the first year. Ultrasound and MSCT&#xD;
      imaging methods are non-invasive techniques that are part of regular follow up after&#xD;
      endovascular aneurysm repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Statistical Analysis and sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1. Sample size justification and statistical methods The present study aims to enroll 150&#xD;
      patients from different high-volume centers over a recruitment period of 2 years. The serum&#xD;
      levels of the MMP - 9 will be compared between patients and between the different visits&#xD;
      using logistic regression models. Interactions between MMP - 9 levels and different types of&#xD;
      endoleak will be investigated in subgroup analyses. Also interaction between anatomical data,&#xD;
      demographic and procedural data with serum levels of the MMP - 9 , aneurysm sac size and&#xD;
      presence of endoleak will be analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.2. Interim analysis An interim analysis will be performed after completing one month follow&#xD;
      up of first 30 patients in order to check the serum levels of the MMP - 9 and its calculation&#xD;
      difficulties - if any.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound and MSCT examinations detailed in the protocol are part of the routine clinical&#xD;
      work-up in patients before and after EVAR without any known side effects in patients without&#xD;
      contraindications. With the exception of blood sampling, no invasive examinations are made.&#xD;
      Identifying the benefit of the serum levels of the MMP - 9 as a biomarker of endoleak could&#xD;
      contribute to better detection of endoleak and reduce costs and efficacy of the follow up. It&#xD;
      will support selection of different follow up protocols on the individual basis for every&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the BIOLEAK study is completely voluntary. Eligible patients are informed&#xD;
      about the study by investigators and will be given written patient information. Patients&#xD;
      willing to participate are required to provide written informed consent to participate. Study&#xD;
      participants retain the right to withdraw their consent to participate at any time after&#xD;
      initial consent was given, without any consequences for clinical management and standard of&#xD;
      care received. If a patient withdraws consent or not willing to participate during the&#xD;
      process of follow up (rejecting blood sampling or repetitive MSCT or ultrasound exam),&#xD;
      available data should be used in the overall analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Study management 8.1. Study management and participating centers This study is led by the&#xD;
      Clinic for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery of the Serbian Clinical Center (lead&#xD;
      investigator Prof Dr Lazar Davidovic). Its Serbian phase is a part of the scientific research&#xD;
      project (No 175008) supported by the Ministry of Education and Science of the Republic of&#xD;
      Serbia. Collaborating centres are in the process of entering the study at the moment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All centers performing endovascular exclusion of the infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysms&#xD;
      with available imaging, ultrasonographic and laboratory facilities are invited to join this&#xD;
      trial. Physicians that enroll patients into the BIOLEAK study will act as co-investigators&#xD;
      and participate as authors in resulting publications. Center willing to participate will&#xD;
      apply by filling the COLLABORATING CENTRE TRACK RECORD and sending it to the leading&#xD;
      investigator - Prof Dr Lazar Davidovic at davidovic.lazar@gmail.com . In this form it is&#xD;
      possible and encouraging to state multiple operators, ultrasonographers and MSCT reading&#xD;
      physicians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigator-initiated trial. The lead investigator and co-investigators will have&#xD;
      unrestricted access to the data. The local investigators at the participating centers will&#xD;
      meet with the lead investigator and co-investigators on a regular basis to discuss progress&#xD;
      of recruitment and assess the quality of the acquired data. The lead investigator,&#xD;
      co-investigators, the local ethics committee or any other supervisory body may audit or&#xD;
      inspect the local study sites at any time. Data steering committee will be formed once this&#xD;
      study becomes a multicentre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.2. Data storage and protection Documentation of the data of every study participant will be&#xD;
      done by completing electronic forms and sent via fax to the BIOLEAK study center at the&#xD;
      Clinic for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery of the Serbian Clinical Center. Blood samples&#xD;
      will be separately analyzed in every participating center where will be stored and kept under&#xD;
      the local regulations. If consent is withdrawn at any time after study entry, any blood&#xD;
      samples obtained from the patient should be destroyed. Any results obtained from the analysis&#xD;
      of those samples before consent was withdrawn may be used for research purposes.&#xD;
