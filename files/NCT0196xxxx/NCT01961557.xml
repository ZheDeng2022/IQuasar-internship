      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Cerebral palsy (CP) is the most common motor disorder in children. CP often causes crouch&#xD;
      gait, an abnormal way of walking. Knee crouch has many causes, so no single device or&#xD;
      approach works best for everybody. This study s adjustable brace provides many types of&#xD;
      walking assistance. Researchers will evaluate brace options to find the best solution for&#xD;
      each participant, and whether one solution works best for the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To evaluate a new brace to improve crouch gait in children with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children 5 17 years old with CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers 5 17 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All participants will be screened with medical history and physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Healthy volunteers will have 1 visit. They will do motion analysis, EMG, and EEG&#xD;
           described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with CP will have 6 visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;1. Motion analysis: Balls will be taped to participants skin. This helps cameras follow&#xD;
      their movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;2. EMG: Metal discs will be taped to participants skin. They measure electrical muscle&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;3. Participants knee movement will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;4. Participants will walk 50 meters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &lt;TAB&gt;5. Participants legs will be cast to make custom braces.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will wear their new braces and have them adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Steps 1 3 will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EEG: Small metal discs will be placed on the participants scalp. They record brain&#xD;
           waves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will have electrical stimulation of their knees and practice extending&#xD;
           them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will take several walks with the braces in different settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visits 3 5: participants will repeat the walking and some other steps from visit 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Visit 6 will repeat visit 2.&#xD;

      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this protocol is to evaluate several configurations of a prototype Extension&#xD;
      Assist Knee-Ankle-Foot Orthosis (EA-KAFO) in patients with cerebral palsy (CP), muscular&#xD;
      dystrophy (MD), spina bifida (SB), or incomplete spinal cord injury (iSCI) who have knee&#xD;
      extension deficiency. Three forms of assistance will be provided at the knee joint including&#xD;
      a passive-damper component, functional electrical stimulation (FES) to the quadriceps, and a&#xD;
      motorized assist. One form will provide controllable resistance at the knee to strengthen&#xD;
      muscles and promote knee extension after the resistance is removed. These will be compared to&#xD;
      traditional bracing which typically improves crouch by blocking some or all motion at one or&#xD;
      both joints. We hypothesize that all assistive configurations will improve gait alignment and&#xD;
      performance compared to the non-assisted conditions. We further hypothesize that a best&#xD;
      solution for each participant will exist, but may vary across subjects due to the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of these movement disorders. Preliminary data on brain activation using EEG&#xD;
      will be collected during all walking conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty (30) subjects, age 5 and above, diagnosed with crouch gait from diplegic CP, (30)&#xD;
      subjects, age 5 and above, with knee extension deficiency from MD, SB, or iSCI (15 from each&#xD;
      group) and 10 age-matched healthy volunteers will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This protocol will evaluate an EA-KAFO prototype consisting of a custom fabricated brace&#xD;
      combined with a modular knee joint with three modes of operation: hinge (no assist), a&#xD;
      passive spring-damper, and an active motorized assist. Since crouch can also be precipitated&#xD;
      at the ankle, the orthotic ankle joint has an adjustable dynamic resistance (ADR) mechanism&#xD;
      that can be locked (passive assist) to simulate a standard brace, free, or provide variable&#xD;
      resistance to assist knee extension. Additionally, we will combine quadriceps FES with the&#xD;
      hinge and the passive damper to create two hybrid configurations. The hinge and the passive&#xD;
      damper (Ultraflex ) knee modules, and ADR ankle brace are FDA-approved (Class I),&#xD;
      commercially available devices. This protocol for evaluation of the active motorized joint&#xD;
      module, the two hybrid configurations, and the controllable resistance device (PowerWalk by&#xD;
      Agilik Technologies) has been reviewed by the FDA as a medical device study and was&#xD;
      determined by the FDA to be non-significant risk. Healthy controls will come for one visit,&#xD;
      and participants with movement disorders will complete 6-10 visits: 1) initial assessment and&#xD;
      casting for custom leg brace; 2) EA-KAFO configuration; 3) initial data collection and&#xD;
      practice; 4-5) accommodation to brace configurations; 6) final data collection. Additional&#xD;
      accommodation visits may be added if necessary, up to the maximum of 10 total visits.&#xD;
      Participants with movement disorders will be permitted to re-enroll in the protocol is a&#xD;
      minimum of 1 year has passed from their prior final visit. Motion capture, force plates, and&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) will be used for gait analysis while electroencephalography (EEG) will&#xD;
      measure brain activity during walking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the amount of knee flexion during gait. The optimal solution for each&#xD;
      individual will be that which provides the greatest reduction in peak knee angle. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will include gait speed, knee extensor moment, and EEG activation profiles.&#xD;
