  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Some carbohydrates (complex sugars) which are found in grains, fruit and vegetables, cannot&#xD;
      be digested by humans. When eaten they pass through the small bowel to the large bowel, or&#xD;
      colon. Some bacteria that live in the colon are able to digest these carbohydrates, and use&#xD;
      them as an energy source. This releases energy that humans can absorb, and may have other&#xD;
      effects on health as well. The process also releases gases such as hydrogen and methane into&#xD;
      the colon, which will eventually be released as flatulence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is some evidence in animals, and humans, that changing the carbohydrate content of the&#xD;
      diet may increase the numbers of bacteria in the colon that can use this energy source.&#xD;
      Recent work has looked at how changes in colon bacteria and carbohydrate in the diet affect&#xD;
      transit, the speed at which food and stool moves through the stomach and bowels. This&#xD;
      undergraduate project will use techniques in Magnetic Resonance Imaging developed in&#xD;
      Nottingham to investigate how a prolonged change in dietary carbohydrate might affect speed&#xD;
      of transit through the bowel and gas production in the colon, and whether there is any&#xD;
      evidence of a change in the level of signalling chemicals that may affect bowel function.&#xD;

    <description>5 markers pills will be swallowed 24 hours before MRI scanning. Each pill will be given a score 0-9 based on the colonic segment where it is located. The weighted mean of these scores will be the geometric centre. Previous validation allows a transit time to be calculated from the geometric centre.</description>

    <description>We will measure 4 symptoms from a previously validated questionnaire on a scale of 0 (none), 1 (mild/ distinct but negligible), 2 (moderate/ annoying), 3 (severe/ disabling), and also on a Visual Analogue Scale (0-100)&#xD;
Symptoms include abdominal pain, bloating, gas/flatulence, and diarrhoea.&#xD;
We will define clinically important symptoms as a composite score of 3 or more at any time point or on any day.</description>
