  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke patients who have little or no voluntary movement in the hand on the more affected&#xD;
      side of their body more than one year after stroke have few treatment options. This project&#xD;
      proposes to test the efficacy of a form of Constraint-Induced Movement therapy designed for&#xD;
      patients with such severe impairment in conjunction with an agent, fluoxetine, which has been&#xD;
      shown in some studies to enhance brain neuroplasticity in response to training.&#xD;
      Constraint-Induced Movement therapy, which is abbreviated CIMT, is a form of physical&#xD;
      rehabilitation based on basic research in neuroscience and behavioral science. If the project&#xD;
      is successful, an efficacious, evidence-based therapy will become available to stroke&#xD;
      patients for what is now a largely untreated condition&#xD;

    <time_frame>baseline to 90 days</time_frame>
    <description>This is a structured interview. Patients and family caregivers, if available, are asked to rate how well and how much the stroke survivor has used his or her more-affected arm on 30 upper-extremity tasks outside of the treatment setting over a specified period. The test score is the mean of the item scores. The primary outcome will be change on this instrument from pre- to post-treatment.</description>

&#xD;
          -  Motor criteria determinations will be made with the subject sitting. The more-affected&#xD;
             forearm will be resting on a supporting surface (e.g., arm of a chair) to allow for&#xD;
             maximum wrist flexion with gravity.&#xD;

               -  initiate extension and flexion at the elbow,&#xD;
&#xD;

             or renal disease, any end-stage pulmonary or cardiovascular disease, senility or a&#xD;
             deteriorated condition due to age, uncontrolled epilepsy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Motor problems that are not primarily unilateral.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Poor motivation to participate in the study (if a person is only marginally&#xD;
             interested, he/she is a bad risk as a subject).&#xD;
