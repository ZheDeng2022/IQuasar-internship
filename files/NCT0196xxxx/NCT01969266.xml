      The purpose of this study is to examine the exposure and safety of a supratherapeutic dose of&#xD;
      PCI-32765 (ibrutinib) in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), 2-period, sequential,&#xD;
      exploratory study in healthy adult men and women to determine the exposure and safety of a&#xD;
      supratherapeutic dose of PCI-32765 (ibrutinib) as a capsule or solution formulation&#xD;
      administered with food. Eight participants (including at least 2 women) will be enrolled and&#xD;
      receive 2 treatments: PCI-32765 840 mg will be administered as capsule (Treatment A in Period&#xD;
      1) and solution (Treatment B in Period 2) formulations. All participants will receive both&#xD;
      treatments with a 7-day washout period between doses. A high-fat breakfast will be provided 2&#xD;
      hours before dosing. Serial pharmacokinetic (study of what the body does to a drug) samples&#xD;
      will be collected before dosing and over 72 hours after each dose and safety will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study. The total duration of the study will be approximately 46&#xD;
      days.&#xD;
