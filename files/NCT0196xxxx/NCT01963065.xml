      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the impact of environmental exposures during the&#xD;
      NICU hospitalization on preterm infant development. The research team is interested in both&#xD;
      chemical and non-chemical exposures. Research studies have shown that babies are exposed to&#xD;
      plasticizers (bisphenol A, phthalates) in the NICU. Plasticizers are chemicals that are used&#xD;
      to make plastic medical equipment soft and flexible. The research team wants to find out&#xD;
      whether NICU-based exposure to chemicals (including common plasticizers) and other&#xD;
      non-chemical exposures like stress makes a difference to how they grow and develop.&#xD;

      1. Significance Premature newborns may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of toxic&#xD;
           chemicals in the environment because of their small body size, immature hepatic and&#xD;
           renal clearance mechanisms, and rapid rate of development. Approximately 8% of neonates&#xD;
           in the United States require admission to a NICU following birth; thus over 300,000&#xD;
           infants annually are exposed to the chemical-intensive hospital environment during a&#xD;
           developmentally vulnerable period. Infants cared for in the NICU have increased risk of&#xD;
           developmental delay, cognitive dysfunction, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder,&#xD;
           and autism that is only partially explained by degree of prematurity or severity of&#xD;
           clinical disease. Abnormalities found on neuroimaging are relatively insensitive&#xD;
           predictors of long-term cognitive and behavioral outcome. Moreover, many medical&#xD;
           conditions associated with prematurity, such as chronic lung disease and retinopathy of&#xD;
           prematurity, are incompletely predicted by gestational age at birth or severity of&#xD;
           newborn illness. The study team hypothesizes that a portion of the neurocognitive,&#xD;
           social, and somatic impairments seen in NICU graduates are attributable to potentially&#xD;
           preventable NICU-based exposures.&#xD;
&#xD;
           As NICU care has matured, survival is likely for all but the most premature infants. The&#xD;
           research emphasis is therefore shifting from survival to developing methods for&#xD;
           improving the long term growth and development of the patients. The study team believes&#xD;
           this research strategy must examine the potential contribution of environmental&#xD;
           exposures that occur during the NICU stay as predictors of outcome. All subjects in the&#xD;
           proposed study are cared for in the NICU - therefore comparisons are internally valid.&#xD;
           While findings may not be generalizable to non-NICU populations, the potential positive&#xD;
           impact of this work on thousands of NICU graduates makes this work a high impact public&#xD;
           health priority. The study team's focus moderately premature infants as these infants&#xD;
           generally experience much of the third trimester developmental window ex utero in the&#xD;
           NICU, but generally have low rates of significant disease related to prematurity (such&#xD;
           as intraventricular hemorrhage, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, etc). Studies of in utero&#xD;
           exposure to common environmental chemicals and stress indicate the vulnerability of&#xD;
           developmentally immature individuals during this same developmental window. It is&#xD;
           therefore logical to assess whether ex utero exposures occurring in the NICU act&#xD;
           similarly. Additionally, small cross-sectional studies indicate the high exposure levels&#xD;
           faced by NICU inpatients. Through this study, the study team's plan to characterize the&#xD;
           role of hospital-based exposures on preterm infant development.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preliminary Studies and Innovation: Substantial information on the health effects of&#xD;
           community-based early life exposure, as well as the presence in the NICU environment,&#xD;
           exist for both stress and the chemicals of interest in this study. Numerous materials&#xD;
           used in NICU care, such as incubators, respiratory support devices, and intravenous (IV)&#xD;
           and enteral feeding supplies, are made from plastics that act as vehicles of chemical&#xD;
           exposure. Phthalates - chemicals used to make plastic flexible and resilient - are&#xD;
           common in medical materials. Bisphenol A (BPA) and other organic phenols, as well as&#xD;
           contaminating metals are also present in plastic materials. Silver is added to plastic&#xD;
           IV catheter components as an antimicrobial. Parenteral nutrition (PN), frequently&#xD;
           administered for long duration in the NICU, contains Mn. Surprisingly, there is little&#xD;
           evidence to support the safety of the total dose of Mn added to PN, and a growing body&#xD;
           of literature suggests that Mn toxicity may be occurring among NICU patients. Exposure&#xD;
           to these chemicals may be associated with significant developmental impairment, however,&#xD;
           the impact of early-life chemical exposure on neurodevelopment in NICU graduates is&#xD;
           largely unstudied.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evolving evidence suggests that chemical and non-chemical stressors in the NICU may&#xD;
           impact infant neurodevelopment. The built environment, ambient noise, in-hospital&#xD;
           parent-child interactions, and parental stress during the NICU stay have been associated&#xD;
           with altered neurodevelopment among NICU graduates. Socioeconomic factors and&#xD;
           psychological functioning of the primary caregiver are also linked to childhood&#xD;
           neurodevelopmental outcomes generally. These factors must therefore be considered as&#xD;
           confounders and/or modifiers in any comprehensive NICU neurodevelopmental outcome&#xD;
           association study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Study Goals and Plan: This study will identify specific sources of chemical exposure&#xD;
           among NICU inpatients and explore the association between exposure and outcomes. It will&#xD;
           also measure biomarkers of stress response and evaluate the relationship between stress&#xD;
           and outcome. The proposed study will identify the prevalence and dose of chemicals to&#xD;
           which NICU inpatients are exposed and provide data on associations with&#xD;
           neurodevelopmental outcomes. The study team has picked a small number of candidate&#xD;
           chemicals for which exposure is known or likely, the negative neurodevelopmental impact&#xD;
           of community exposure is documented, and the health implications for NICU-based exposure&#xD;
           are unknown. Prior studies have documented numerous phthalate-containing materials in&#xD;
           the NICU and elevated biomarkers of phthalates and BPA in NICU inpatients. These studies&#xD;
           were limited by cross-sectional specimen sampling, patient enrollment without attention&#xD;
           to factors likely to affect chemical metabolism including gestational or chronologic age&#xD;
           and severity of illness, and small sample size. To the study team's knowledge,&#xD;
           biomarkers of NICU-exposure to Ag, Cd, and Mn have not been assessed, despite the&#xD;
           documented presence of these metals in the NICU and known adverse health outcomes&#xD;
           related to early life exposure. No previous study of NICU chemical exposure has&#xD;
           considered the important potential confounders/modifiers of chemical toxicant impact to&#xD;
           be considered in the proposed study. No rigorous study has evaluated biomarkers of&#xD;
           stress and association with outcomes in the NICU hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between biomarkers of exposure to chemicals in the NICU and specific care&#xD;
      practices has not been explored previously. Additionally, the potential association between&#xD;
      NICU-based chemical or stress exposures and neurodevelopmental deficits has not been&#xD;
      evaluated. Two previous studies assessed outcomes related to NICU phthalate exposure, but&#xD;
      neither used exposure biomarkers or other validated exposure assessment methods to&#xD;
      characterize initial exposure nor considered important non-chemical confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NICU-HEALTH cohort addresses these limitations and is a comprehensive, longitudinal&#xD;
      evaluation of chemical exposure in the NICU designed to evaluate environmental chemical&#xD;
      exposure and clinical outcomes in this vulnerable population.&#xD;
