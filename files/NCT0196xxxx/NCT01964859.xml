  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research is being done to determine if investigators can change skin from one type to&#xD;
      another. Specifically, investigators are interested in making normal skin into the thicker&#xD;
      skin found on our palms and soles.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To change the skin identity investigators propose to take skin cells from a person's own sole&#xD;
      or palm (these are called &quot;autologous skin fibroblasts&quot;), multiply them in the lab, inject&#xD;
      the cells (now called a &quot;graft&quot;) back into the same person but at a different site of skin&#xD;
      like the buttock, and then eventually remove the injected cells to see if they caused the&#xD;
      skin to change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators hope that information from this study will help with problems like skin&#xD;
      break-down in patients with amputations and prosthetics. The skin at their stump was not&#xD;
      meant to withstand the pressure and friction of prosthetics and this study is the first step&#xD;
      in trying to convert stump skin to palm/sole-like skin.&#xD;

    <description>Volar keratinocytes have larger area of the cytoplasm. We will quantitate the area of cytoplasm of non-volar keratinocytes to see if they increase selectively with volar fibroblasts as opposed to other fibroblasts injections or vehicle. The change in the area of cytoplasm of non-volar keratinocytes will be measured. The units of this measurement are a ratio of cytoplasmic area to total cellular area as a control.</description>

    <measure>Durometer reading</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Durometers measure the firmness of the skin. We will measure all sites to see if the area injected with volar fibroblasts is more firm. The units of measurement is in Durometer Units.</description>

&#xD;
          -  In the opinion of the investigator, must be medically able to undergo the&#xD;
             administration of study material determined by laboratory tests obtained within 7 days&#xD;
             before baseline for which the investigator identified no clinically significant&#xD;
             abnormality.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be able to comprehend the informed consent document and provide consent for&#xD;
             participation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  have a negative pregnancy test at screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  agree to not become pregnant or breastfeed for the period of the study through 1&#xD;
                  month after completion of the study&#xD;

               -  be willing to use a reliable form of contraception during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have healthy skin as determined by the PI or study Nurse Practitioner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to comply with the scheduled visits, biopsy/injection procedures,&#xD;
             wound care instructions treatment plan, and other study procedures for the duration of&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Having received any investigational drug within 30 days prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An allergy history to any study materials including local anesthetic, dimethyl&#xD;
             sulfoxide, human albumin, or bovine constituents, or hetastarch&#xD;

             Hepatitis C). Biopsies taken from individuals with infections that are not allowed to&#xD;
             enter the cell therapy core will make it such that these individuals cannot&#xD;
             participate.&#xD;
