    <textblock>
      This research study is evaluating a drug called cabozantinib as a possible treatment for&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This research study is a Phase I clinical trial. Phase I trials&#xD;
      test the safety of an investigational drug or combination of drugs. Phase I studies also try&#xD;
      to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further studies. This&#xD;
      means that the FDA has not approved giving cabozantinib for use in patients, including&#xD;
      patients with your type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug cabozantinib works by inhibiting several different proteins which are believed&#xD;
      to be involved in the growth and multiplication of the cancerous cells associated with acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia. This drug has been used in other research studies and information from&#xD;
      those other research studies suggests that this drug may help to prevent cancer growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purpose of this research study is to determine the highest dose of Cabozantinib&#xD;
      that can safely be given without severe or unmanageable side effects. The dose identified in&#xD;
      this study will be used in future research studies that seek to determine the role of&#xD;
      cabozantinib as a treatment for AML.&#xD;

      Before the research starts (screening): After signing this consent form, the participant will&#xD;
      be asked to undergo some screening tests or procedures to find out if they can be in the&#xD;
      research study. Many of these tests and procedures are likely to be part of regular cancer&#xD;
      care and may be done even if it turns out that the participant does not take part in the&#xD;
      research study. If the participant has had some of these tests or procedures recently, they&#xD;
      may or may not have to be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A medical history, which includes questions about the participant's past and present&#xD;
           treatments, their health history, current medications, blood transfusions, and any&#xD;
           allergies the participant, may have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam will be performed which will include the measurement of the following:&#xD;
           weight and height, and vital signs (blood pressure, heart and breathing rate, oral&#xD;
           temperature.).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status, which evaluates how the participant is able to carry on with your&#xD;
           usual activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test if the participant is a woman who is able to have children. This will be&#xD;
           done with urine or blood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test a sample of urine will be taken to check for abnormal cells or signs of&#xD;
           infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyroid test a blood test to assess for normal functioning of the participant's thyroid&#xD;
           gland&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (EKG): leads are applied to the participant's chest to record their&#xD;
           heart beat and rhythm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Echocardiogram (ECHO) or MUGA scan of your heart: An echocardiogram is an ultrasound to&#xD;
           see how the participant's heart is functioning. A MUGA is also an ultrasound to see how&#xD;
           their heart is functioning. For a MUGA, a radioactive substance is injected into the&#xD;
           participant's vein and a picture of their heart is created using a special camera.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: approximately 3-4 teaspoons of blood will be drawn to measure the&#xD;
           participant's disease level and to determine if their organs are working well enough to&#xD;
           allow them to safely participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy: a needle will be inserted into the participant's hip or&#xD;
           breast bone in order to remove a small amount of bone marrow cells. Samples will also be&#xD;
           collected for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these tests show that the participant is eligible to participate in the research study,&#xD;
      then the participant will begin the study treatment. If the participant does not meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria, the participant will not be able to participate in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional research procedures to be performed at the time of screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: approximately 4 teaspoons of blood will be taken for research purposes.&#xD;
           Research samples will be taken and compared later in the study to discover how&#xD;
           cabozantinib works in fighting the participant's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy: Bone marrow aspirate samples, approximately 1 teaspoon,&#xD;
           from a bone marrow aspirate/biopsy done prior to screening will be taken for research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening procedures confirm that the participant is eligible to participate in the&#xD;
      research study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug (cabozantinib ): If the participant takes part in this research study, the&#xD;
      participant will be given a study drug diary for each study cycle. Each study cycle is 28&#xD;
      days (4 weeks). Cabozantinib comes in the form of tablets which the participant will take by&#xD;
      mouth once a day. Detailed instructions on how to take cabozantinib can be found in their&#xD;
      study drug diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Study Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests and Procedures: The participant will come to the clinic on Days 1, 2, 8, 15, 22, and 28&#xD;
      of cycle 1, days 1, 8, 15, and 28 of cycle 2, and days 1 and 15 of every subsequent cycle.&#xD;
      Visits to clinic may be more frequent if determined by the study doctor. The participant will&#xD;
      have the following tests and procedures at your visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments will be completed while on trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Urine test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood tests: Both routine and research samples will be drawn throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspirate/ biopsy: A bone marrow aspirate/biopsy will be completed on day 28 of&#xD;
      cycle 1 of cabozantinib. A bone marrow biopsy may also be done if the participant's cancer&#xD;
      does not appear to be getting better, at approximately day 42 after start of therapy. A bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsy/aspirate may also be performed if their disease returns/relapses at any time&#xD;
      during this study or to assess for disease response. The bone marrow aspirate/biopsy for this&#xD;
      study will not be performed if the participant has withdrawn from the study, or/and the&#xD;
      participant has received other treatment for their disease. Bone marrow aspirate samples,&#xD;
      approximately one teaspoon, will also be obtained for research at these time points. Please&#xD;
      note that a blood sample for research purpose will also be drawn on the day of the&#xD;
      participant's bone marrow aspirate/biopsy. Approximately two teaspoons of blood will be&#xD;
      drawn.&#xD;

             also used. All subjects of reproductive potential must agree to use both a barrier&#xD;
             method and a second method of birth control during the course of the study and for 4&#xD;
