  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a study to assess the efficacy and safety of oral Istradefylline (KW-6002) in&#xD;
      patients with moderate to severe Parkinson's Disease. While on this study, participants will&#xD;
      continue to take their usual, prescribed, stable regimen of Levodopa/Carbidopa or&#xD;
      Levodopa/Benserazide therapy plus adjunct Parkinson's medications. Patients will be&#xD;
      randomized 1:1:1 to receive either Istradefylline 20 mg per day, or Istradefylline 40 mg per&#xD;
      day or an equivalent placebo. Patients will be treated for a 12 week period to demonstrate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of Istradefylline in improving Parkinson's disease symptoms (referred to as&#xD;
      improvement in patient OFF time) and that Istradefylline has an acceptable safety profile in&#xD;
      this group.&#xD;

    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) evaluates various aspects of Parkinson's disease including non-motor and motor experiences of daily living and motor complications. Part III assesses the motor signs of Parkinson's Disease with a rating from 0 to 4, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The possible score range of Part III is 0 to 68. The lower the score, the more favorable the response.</description>

    <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) evaluates various aspects of Parkinson's disease including non-motor and motor experiences of daily living and motor complications. Part II is a self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADL) including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food with a rating from 0 to 4, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The possible score range of Part II is 0 to 52. The lower the score, the more favorable the response.</description>

    <description>The &quot;key symptom&quot; on the PGI-I was evaluated at baseline and subsequent post-baseline visits for the subject's overall condition and the symptoms of fatigue, sleep, motivation to get things done, and each subject's key symptom. Subjects rated each on a scale of 1 to 5 for change from baseline utilizing the following scale:&#xD;
1 = Moderate improvement (or greater)&#xD;
2 = Mild improvement&#xD;
3 = No change from baseline&#xD;
4 = Mild deterioration&#xD;
5 = Moderate deterioration (or greater)&#xD;
A lower number is a better outcome. Overall condition is presented below.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 12.</time_frame>
    <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a 21-question test that measures the severity of depression. Subjects rated each on a scale of 0 to 3 for change from baseline utilizing the following scale:&#xD;
0 = I do not feel sad&#xD;
1 = I feel sad&#xD;
2 = I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it&#xD;
3 = I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it&#xD;
The test is scored for each question using the above scale to determine the severity of depression. Scoring is as shown below:&#xD;
0 to 9: minimal depression&#xD;
10 to 18: mild depression&#xD;
19 to 29: moderate depression&#xD;
30 to 63: severe depression</description>

        <title>Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Motor Examination Score (Part III);</title>
        <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) evaluates various aspects of Parkinson's disease including non-motor and motor experiences of daily living and motor complications. Part III assesses the motor signs of Parkinson's Disease with a rating from 0 to 4, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The possible score range of Part III is 0 to 68. The lower the score, the more favorable the response.</description>

        <description>The Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) evaluates various aspects of Parkinson's disease including non-motor and motor experiences of daily living and motor complications. Part II is a self-evaluation of the activities of daily life (ADL) including speech, swallowing, handwriting, dressing, hygiene, falling, salivating, turning in bed, walking, and cutting food with a rating from 0 to 4, where 0 = normal, 1 = slight, 2 = mild, 3 = moderate, and 4 = severe. The possible score range of Part II is 0 to 52. The lower the score, the more favorable the response.</description>

        <description>The Beck Depression Inventory is a 21-question test that measures the severity of depression. Subjects rated each on a scale of 0 to 3 for change from baseline utilizing the following scale:&#xD;
0 = I do not feel sad&#xD;
1 = I feel sad&#xD;
2 = I am sad all the time and I can't snap out of it&#xD;
3 = I am so sad or unhappy that I can't stand it&#xD;
The test is scored for each question using the above scale to determine the severity of depression. Scoring is as shown below:&#xD;
0 to 9: minimal depression&#xD;
10 to 18: mild depression&#xD;
19 to 29: moderate depression&#xD;
30 to 63: severe depression</description>
