    <textblock>
      Child food allergy represent 6 to 8% of child in industrialised country. Within this allergy,&#xD;
      peanuts and egg allergy are one of the most common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Actually when there is a suspicion of food allergy, the OPT is the gold standard for the&#xD;
      diagnosis. During the OPT we give increasing doses of the allergen to the patient and&#xD;
      evaluate threshold causing a clinical reaction. This test is associated with a risk of strong&#xD;
      allergic reaction and need a medical supervision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard allergy test, like skin test or specific IgE test, can't be use for the diagnosis of&#xD;
      these allergy. Some publications demonstrate that these tests lack sensibility and&#xD;
      specificity for child food allergy diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New tests have to be develop to diagnosis child food allergy without risks. The BAT is a&#xD;
      cellular test able to evaluate the basophiles activation by specific allergen in vitro. This&#xD;
      test allow us to evaluate more physiologically the sensitization of patients to an allergen.&#xD;
      It is already used in drug allergy and it has been evaluated in infant milk allergy in an&#xD;
      other clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study we want to evaluate the sensitivity of BAT to the diagnosis of child food&#xD;
      allergy compare to the gold standard test OPT. We will evaluate the BAT on 140 children with&#xD;
      food allergy and compare this results with the OPT at the same time. If the BAT results can&#xD;
      predict the sensitivity of children to food allergen, it could limit the use of the OPT and&#xD;
      reduce the risk of this test.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Child food allergy represent 6 to 8% of child in industrialised country. One third of these&#xD;
      child will develop severe reactions and one third will experience multiple allergy. In&#xD;
      France, there is few epidemiologic data but in 2005 F. Rancé evaluated the prevalence of&#xD;
      these allergy to 6.7% of school child. Within the food allergen, peanut, egg and milk are the&#xD;
      most common.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is two diagnostic possibilities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A strong allergic reaction with identified allergens and specific IgE positive, making&#xD;
           it highly probable diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A moderate allergic reaction with only suspicion on the allergen, without definitive&#xD;
           diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When there is a suspected allergy, the gold standard to the diagnosis is the OPT. This test&#xD;
      consist of the gradual ingestion of the suspected food allergen to evaluate the threshold&#xD;
      causing a clinical reaction. The OPT must be performed under medical supervision in a&#xD;
      hospital due to the risk of severe allergic reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OPT is the gold standard in allergy diagnosis. The other tests (prick test, IgE specific&#xD;
      measure…) are not sensitive enough. Furthermore, the level of IgE specific was not related to&#xD;
      the risk to develop clinical reaction to the food allergen. Some studies have try to combine&#xD;
      skin tests with the result of IgE specific measure but the sensitivity did not improve&#xD;
      enough.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New tests have to be develop to diagnosis child food allergy without risks. The BAT is a&#xD;
      cellular test able to evaluate, in blood, the basophiles activation by specific allergen in&#xD;
      vitro. This test measure by flow cytométrie the expression of activation molecule (CD63) on&#xD;
      basophiles (CCR3+) after incubation with the allergen. If the patient is sensitize to the&#xD;
      allergen, the percentage of active basophiles will be higher than in non sensitize people.&#xD;
      This test allow us to evaluate more physiologically the sensitization of patients to an&#xD;
      allergen. This test has already been tested for drug allergy and milk allergy in child. This&#xD;
      clinical trial demonstrated that in mill allergy, the BAT had a good sensitivity (91% and&#xD;
      sensibility (96%). Furthermore, this study could determined the threshold of the BAT in child&#xD;
      food allergy (6% of activated basophiles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In light of these results, we want to evaluate the advantage of BAT compare to OPT in child&#xD;
      with allergy to egg or peanut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, we will perform BAT on a blood sample from child suspected of food allergy&#xD;
      (egg or peanut) before OPT and we will compare its results with the OPT results. The primary&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate the BAT interest to predict the results of OPT by&#xD;
      analysing the sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value, negative predictive value&#xD;
      of BAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If these study demonstrate that BAT can predict OPT results for child food allergy, we will&#xD;
      be able to reduce the number of OPT for these patients and reduce the risk of anaphylactic&#xD;
      shock during OPT.&#xD;
