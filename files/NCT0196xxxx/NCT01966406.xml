  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Nasogastric decompression was routinely used in most major intra-abdominal operations.&#xD;
      Nasogastric tube intubation was thought to decrease postoperative ileus (nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      and gastric distension). Wound and respiratory complications, and to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      anastomotic leaks after gastrointestinal surgery. However, the necessity of nasogastric&#xD;
      decompression following elective abdominal surgery has been increasingly questioned over the&#xD;
      last several years. Many clinical studies have suggested that this practice does not provide&#xD;
      any benefit but could increase patient discomfort and respiratory complications. Furthermore,&#xD;
      meta-analyses have concluded that routine nasogastric decompression is no longer warranted&#xD;
      after elective abdominal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elective abdominal surgery without nasogastric decompression was initially tested and then&#xD;
      widely used on patients with colorectal surgery. However, after upper gastrointestinal&#xD;
      operations such as gastrectomy, nasogastric has been considered necessary to prevent the&#xD;
      consequences of postoperative ileus (anastomotic leakage or leaking from the duodenal stump.&#xD;
      Therefore, studies of gastrectomy without nasogastric tube emerged later than those of&#xD;
      colectomy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In spite more and more studies reported of no need of nasogastric tube after abdominal&#xD;
      operation, no papers reported after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Postulated causes of lack in&#xD;
      studies to assess the need of a nasogastric tube after pancreaticoduodenectomy include&#xD;
      anticipated prolonged postoperative paralytic ileus caused by PD-related extensive&#xD;
      destruction and potential risk of gastric stasis after PD. However, our pilot study of&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of postoperative NG drainage amount in 100 patients recently having PD&#xD;
      at our hospital showed more than 90 % of patients had less than 200cc/day NG drainage amount&#xD;
      in the first three days after operation. Theoretically, these patients will not need a&#xD;
      nasogastric tube after pancreaticoduodenectomy. Therefore, we propose a prospective&#xD;
      multicenter randomized trial to assess the need of a nasogastric tube after PD.&#xD;

      The study will be started only after approval of Ethics Committee of National Taiwan&#xD;
      University Hospital and consent sheet will be obtained from all included patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients planned to have PD at national Taiwan University Hospital will be included in this&#xD;
      study after obtaining their consent sheet. Patients with emergency surgery, history of&#xD;
      abdominal irradiation or operation will be excluded from the study. PD will be performed as&#xD;
      described before, including feeding gastrostomy tube. The type of surgery (pylorus preserving&#xD;
      or standard PD) and the type of management of the pancreatic stump (pancreaticojejunostomy or&#xD;
      pancreaticogastrostomy) will be left to the surgeons' discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Included patients will be randomized into tube group and non-tube control group. Patients in&#xD;
      the tube group will have a 14- or 16-French nasogastric tube inserted before the operation.&#xD;
      For patients in both tube and non-tube groups, enteral feeding will be routinely started&#xD;
      within 24 h after the operation and consisted of 480 mL (20 mL/h continuously) of&#xD;
      commercially available enteral nutrition solution, with a calorie-to-milliliter ratio of 1:1&#xD;
      and glucose-to-lipid ratio of 70:30. The rate of delivery will be progressively increased by&#xD;
      10 mL/day until the goal of full nutrition (25 kcal/kg) will be reached. Enteral nutrition&#xD;
      will be reduced and subsequently stopped when the patient is able to eat a sufficient amount&#xD;
      of food. (at least 1,500 kcal/day) without vomiting. In some patients, feeding rates will be&#xD;
      reduced or stopped as a result of significant abdominal symptoms after advancement to full&#xD;
      enteral support via the jejunostomy tube in the first few postoperative days. At that time,&#xD;
      many were beginning oral diets and therefore jejunostomy feeding was not increased or even&#xD;
      stopped. Patients who could not resume oral intake will be encouraged daily to maintain or&#xD;
      increase enteral feeding to the level of the nutrition goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in non-tube group, after first flatus passage, the patient will be allowed to&#xD;
      drink 300-500 mL of liquids, and afterwards a soft diet will be given for 2 days. If this&#xD;
      well tolerated, increasing amounts of solid food will be given. The NGT will be reinserted if&#xD;
      the patient later vomits a volume of more than 300 mL on more than one occasion. Reinserted&#xD;
      tubes will be removed if the reflux is less than 200 mL per 24 h, and oral feeding (initially&#xD;
      with a liquid diet) will be tried again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients in tube group, the nasogastric tube will be removed simultaneously when the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube is removed. After first flatus passage, the patient will be allowed to&#xD;
      drink 300-500 mL of liquids, and afterwards a soft diet will be given for 2 days. If this&#xD;
      well tolerated, increasing amounts of solid food will be given. The NGT will be reinserted if&#xD;
      the patient later vomits a volume of more than 300 mL on more than one occasion. Reinserted&#xD;
      tubes will be removed if the reflux is less than 200 mL per 24 h, and oral feeding (initially&#xD;
      with a liquid diet) will be tried again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the surgical staff, not involved in the trial, will record postoperative&#xD;
      complications. The postoperative course of each patient will be closely monitored. The day of&#xD;
      passage of flatus and oral food intake, the duration of nasogastric tube or nasojejunal&#xD;
      decompression, and length of hospital stay will be recorded. Mortality, abdominal&#xD;
      complications, pulmonary complications (pneumonia, atelectasis), postoperative fever, nausea,&#xD;
      and vomiting, tube insertion or reinsertion, and discomfort from the tube (ear pain, nasal&#xD;
      soreness, painful swallowing) will be noted. According to the recommendation by the&#xD;
      International Study Group of Pancreatic Surgery (ISGPS), gastroparesis will be defined as the&#xD;
      need for an NGT for &gt;3 days or the need to reinsert the NGT for persistent vomiting after&#xD;
      surgery. The severity of gastroparesis will be classified by the ISGPS definition as grade A:&#xD;
      NGT required for 4-7 days or reinsertion after postoperative day (POD) 3 or inability to&#xD;
      tolerate solid oral intake by POD 7; grade B: NGT required for 8-14 days or inability to&#xD;
      tolerate solid oral intake by POD 14; grade C: NGT required for &gt;14 days or inability to&#xD;
      tolerate solid food by POD 21. Again, according to the International Study Group definition,&#xD;
      postoperative pancreatic fistula will be defined as output via an operatively placed drain&#xD;
      (or a subsequently placed percutaneous drain) of any measurable volume of drain fluid on or&#xD;
      after POD 3, with an amylase content greater than three times the upper normal serum value.&#xD;
      Postoperative bleeding will also be graded using ISGPS definitions. All infectious&#xD;
      complications will be proven by microbiological analysis and positive fluid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare the control and modified groups, all surgical complications will be further&#xD;
      classified by severity using a novel grading system proposed by Dindo et al. In brief, grade&#xD;
      I and II complications include only minor deteriorations from the normal postoperative course&#xD;
      that can be treated with drugs, blood transfusion, physiotherapy, and nutritional supply.&#xD;
      Grade III complications require interventional treatment. Grade IV complications are&#xD;
      life-threatening and require intensive care unit management. Death is the only grade V&#xD;
      complication. Grade I and II complications will be classified as minor and grades III, IV,&#xD;
      and V will be classified as major.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for comparison will be the difference in postoperative course&#xD;
      determined by continuous variables (time to first passage of flatus, first oral intake,&#xD;
      duration of postoperative perfusions, and hospital stay after operation).&#xD;
