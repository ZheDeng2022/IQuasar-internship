      Rapid and reliable exclusion of acute myocardial infarction (AMI) during an emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) triage is a major unmet clinical need. We aimed at verifying the&#xD;
      non-inferiority of a single-sampling strategy of hs-cTn and copeptin compared with the dual&#xD;
      hs-cTn sampling for the early diagnosis of Non-ST-Elevation Acute Coronary Syndromes&#xD;
      (NSTE-ACS) versus Non Coronary Chest Pain (NCCP) in a selected cohort of consecutive patients&#xD;
      admitted at the Emergency Department.&#xD;

      The evaluation of chest pain patients in the emergency department remains a costly and&#xD;
      difficult challenge, because a large proportion of them do not suffer from an acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome (ACS). The adequate ruling out of ACS in patients with chest pain is crucial, as the&#xD;
      erroneous discharge of a patient with ACS is associated with a high risk of cardiac events.&#xD;
      Rapid assessment of these patients is critical to direct further diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies. Electrocardiography (ECG) and cardiac troponin (cTn) are the current diagnostic&#xD;
      cornerstones and complement clinical assessment in current AMI guidelines1. They allow to&#xD;
      rule in an acute myocardial infarction (AMI) within the first 3 hours after presentation in&#xD;
      the majority of patients and offer the opportunity to initiate appropriate, evidence-based&#xD;
      treatment. The vast majority of patients presenting to the Emergency Department (ED) with&#xD;
      suspected AMI, however, finally prove not to have AMI. The current process of ruling out AMI&#xD;
      is time-consuming and expensive. One fourth to one-third of patients with AMI present without&#xD;
      significant ECG changes indicative of acute ischemia; therefore, the ECG is of little help to&#xD;
      rule out AMI, especially in the setting of non-ST elevation ACS (NSTE-ACS). High-sensitivity&#xD;
      (hs)-cTn assays have been developed recently, enabling measurements of concentrations that&#xD;
      are âˆ¼10-fold lower than those previously measurable. Recent studies have confirmed the&#xD;
      increased accuracy of these high-sensitivity assays compared with conventional assays in the&#xD;
      early detection of AMI and in the safely ruling in or out of coronary causes of chest pain.&#xD;
      However, concerns have been raised about a possible specificity deficit with these new&#xD;
      assays. In addition, a second measurement of hs-cTn may be warranted in order to increase the&#xD;
      accuracy of the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Copeptin, the C-terminal part of the vasopressin pro-hormone, and a marker of acute&#xD;
      endogenous stress, has been demonstrated to be useful for a more rapid ruling out of acute&#xD;
      myocardial infarction. Current evidence for the diagnostic validity and performance of a&#xD;
      combination of high sensitivity-cardiac troponin and copeptin is limited and controversial. A&#xD;
      Bayesian probabilistic approach is likely to be the correct way to evaluate the possible&#xD;
      incremental value of copeptin in the detection of ACS. Thus, we aim at prospectively&#xD;
      evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of copeptin, hs-cTn, CK-MB and myoglobin, alone or in&#xD;
      combination with hs-cTn, for the early diagnosis and ruling out of Non-ST-Elevation (NSTE)&#xD;
      ACS versus non-cardiac causes of chest pain in a selected cohort of Emergency Department (ED)&#xD;
      chest pain patients according to their pre-test probability, as assessed through a&#xD;
      combination of two validated clinical risk score systems (i.e. Chest Pain Score and TIMI Risk&#xD;
      Score).&#xD;

    <description>We aimed at verifying the hypothesis that diagnostic efficiency of the combination of copeptin and hs-cTn on admission would be non-inferior with respect to the 3 hours interval hs-cTn serial sampling for the early diagnosis or ruling out of NSTE-ACS versus non cardiac chest pain in a selected cohort of consecutive ED chest pain patients. According to current international guidelines we selected a 20% difference between serial hscTn levels to establish the diagnosis of myocardial infarction, since the change represented twice the recommended maximum imprecision (a coefficient of variation of 10%).</description>
