  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      nanOss Bioactive is approved for use in the U.S. The purpose of this study is to compare&#xD;
      fusion results in the posterolateral spine using nanOss Bioactive mixed with autograft bone&#xD;
      and bone marrow aspirate (BMA) on one side and autograft alone on the opposite side of the&#xD;
      treated level(s). It is hypothesized that the use of nanOss Bioactive will result in fusion&#xD;
      at 12 months, with CT evidence of bridging trabecular bone, less than 3mm of translational&#xD;
      motion, and less than 5 degrees of angular motion.&#xD;

      The post market clinical investigation is designed to assess instrumented posterolateral&#xD;
      fusion (PLF) using nanOss Bioactive bone void filler with autograft bone and bone marrow&#xD;
      aspirate in patients with symptomatic spinal stenosis secondary to degenerative disc disease&#xD;
      with up to Grade 1 spondylolisthesis at one or two adjacent levels from L2-S1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, the participant will provide his/her medical history and complete self&#xD;
      assessment forms. The investigator will perform a clinical evaluation and x-rays will be&#xD;
      performed if recent x-rays are not available. Participants will undergo instrumented PLF with&#xD;
      an interbody fusion device (with autograft or allograft) using nanOss Bioactive in&#xD;
      combination with autograft bone and bone marrow aspirate in one posterolateral gutter and&#xD;
      autograft alone in the opposite posterolateral gutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following surgery, operative and discharge information will be collected and a clinical&#xD;
      evaluation will be performed prior to discharge. Participants will be evaluated 6 and 12&#xD;
      months postoperatively. One investigational site will participate in long-term followup of 24&#xD;
      months. Each participant will complete x-rays and self assessment documents. A CT scan&#xD;
      performed at the 12 month postoperative visit will be evaluated by an independent radiologist&#xD;
      to assess fusion results. Complication data will be recorded throughout the study.&#xD;
