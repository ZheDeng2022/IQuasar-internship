  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the feasibility and acceptability of utilizing an&#xD;
      adapted form (i.e. IPT-MBD) of a psychosocial intervention, Interpersonal Psychotherapy for&#xD;
      Depressed Adolescents, for youth with severe mood dysregulation (SMD) or disruptive mood&#xD;
      dysregulation disorder (DMDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that retention rates will be &gt;80%, satisfaction scores will&#xD;
      average 6 (high) on a 7 point satisfaction scale, and that youth who receive the IPT&#xD;
      intervention will have overall improvement in SMD/DMDD symptoms.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This research is being done to learn more about how to help teenagers with a sad or angry&#xD;
      mood, and emotional responses out of proportion to what would be expected in a situation.&#xD;
      Together these symptoms are called Severe Mood Dysregulation (SMD), a research diagnosis, or&#xD;
      disruptive mood dysregulation disorder (DMDD), a newer clinical diagnosis. Currently, there&#xD;
      is no standard treatment for teens that have SMD/DMDD. These teens usually receive medication&#xD;
      and some type of talk therapy. This research is being done to compare two types of talk&#xD;
      therapy to see which is most effective in helping teens with SMD/DMDD. Investigators will&#xD;
      compare treatment as usual (TAU) with Interpersonal Psychotherapy for Youth with Mood and&#xD;
      Behavior Dysregulation (IPT-MBD). Investigators do not know if TAU and IPT-MBD work just as&#xD;
      well, or if one is better than the other. When this study is over, investigators hope there&#xD;
      will be a better idea of how to study treatments for teens with SMD/DMDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For those participants who receive IPT-MBD, are prescribed an antipsychotic, and have&#xD;
      significant improvement in symptoms, investigators will gradually taper the antipsychotic&#xD;
      dose.&#xD;

    <description>To describe/assess feasibility of IPT-MBD, investigators will look at ease of recruitment and retention rate goal of at least 80%.

Investigators will comment on adherence to the overall study, as well as to specific treatment visits.</description>
