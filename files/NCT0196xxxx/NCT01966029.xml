    <textblock>
      There is currently no treatment for MPS IVA other than supportive care for the clinical&#xD;
      manifestations of the disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with BMN 110 to replace the&#xD;
      deficient GALNS is a potential new treatment option for MPS IVA patients. BMN 110, containing&#xD;
      recombinant human GALNS (rhGALNS) developed by BioMarin is expected to reduce the&#xD;
      progressive, pathologic accumulation of KS, and improve signs and symptoms of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this Phase 3B open label study (110-502) will be to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of 2.0 mg/kg/week (qw) of BMN 110 in Australian patients with MPS IVA. In&#xD;
      addition, a number of secondary and tertiary efficacy endpoints will also be investigated.&#xD;
      The dose and regimen of BMN 110 have been selected on the basis of data from a Phase 1/2&#xD;
      clinical study with BMN 110, nonclinical and in vitro studies with BMN 110, and clinical and&#xD;
      nonclinical data from other enzyme replacement therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension Phase is included per amendment dated 10Mar 2014: To provide patients enrolled in&#xD;
      the Initial Phase access to BMN 110 until commercial product becomes available in Australia&#xD;
      and continue to assess long-term safety&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN AND PLAN: This is a multicenter, open-label Phase 3B study designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of BMN 110 in Australian patients with MPS IVA. Approximately 10&#xD;
      patients in Australia with a confirmed diagnosis of MPS IVA will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
      Eligible patients will receive weekly infusion of BMN 110 2.0 mg/kg until BMN 110 becomes&#xD;
      commercially available in Australia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening [Week -4]. After obtaining informed consent, information on demographics,&#xD;
      concomitant medication(s) use and medical history (including pre-study growth data) will be&#xD;
      collected; blood will be drawn for confirming MPS IVA diagnosis by enzymatic test (when&#xD;
      applicable); and, blood and urine for clinical laboratory tests will be collected.&#xD;
      Electrocardiogram (ECG), routine physical examination including standard neurological&#xD;
      examination, vital signs; and cervical spine (flexion-extension) imaging by either&#xD;
      radiographs, or a Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) or CT scan may be collected during&#xD;
      Screening visit. Adverse Events (AEs)/Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) will also be monitored&#xD;
      and collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Visit [Week 1, Day -1]. Upon confirmation of eligibility by confirmed diagnosis of&#xD;
      MPS IVA by enzymatic test, negative pregnancy tests at Baseline (in women of childbearing&#xD;
      age) and medical history, patients will be enrolled in the study and will complete following&#xD;
      assessments: urine KS and urine creatinine, vital signs, routine physical examination&#xD;
      including standard neurological examination, body weight (for verifying dose), clinical&#xD;
      laboratory assessments, immunogenicity tests, ECG, 6MW test, 3MSC test and RFT will be&#xD;
      performed and AEs/SAEs and concomitant medication use will be collected. In addition,&#xD;
      anthropometric parameters (including height) will be measured, pain assessment test&#xD;
      (Adolescent Pediatric Pain Tool [APPT], pain tool in children, adolescents, and adults) will&#xD;
      be administered; and PedsQL (QOL questionnaire for pediatric patients) or SF-36 (QOL&#xD;
      questionnaire for adult patients) questionnaire will also be completed during this visit.&#xD;
      Patients who have abnormal overnight pulse oximetry readings will be assessed for sleep&#xD;
      apnea, the results of which will be calculated using the Apnea-Hypopnea Index (AHI) at&#xD;
      Baseline, Week 25, Week 49 and ETV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visit 1 [Week 1, Day 1]. Patients will receive the first dose of BMN 110 by&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) infusion. Assessments on Day 1 will include vital signs, routine physical&#xD;
      examination including standard neurological examination, and concomitant medication use and&#xD;
      AEs/SAEs. All assessments will be performed prior to treatment, except AEs/SAEs which are&#xD;
      collected continuously throughout the study. Immunogenicity lab tests are completed only in&#xD;
      the event of an Infusion Associated Reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visits [Weeks 2-48]. Patients will be treated weekly with BMN 110 for 48 weeks.&#xD;
      Prior to each weekly treatment, patients will have vital signs and routine physical&#xD;
      examination including standard neurological examination. Concomitant medications and AEs/SAEs&#xD;
      are collected at every visit. Body weight will be determined every 4 weeks after the Day -1&#xD;
      visit to confirm dose volume. Immunogenicity lab tests are completed only in the event of an&#xD;
      Infusion Associated Reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Assessment Visits [Weeks 25 and 49]. The following data will be collected during&#xD;
      weeks 25 and 49: clinical laboratory tests, urine KS and creatinine levels, immunogenicity&#xD;
      test, ECG, 6MW test, 3MSC test, RFTs and anthropometric measurements. The patients will also&#xD;
      complete the APPT test,and PedsQL or SF-36 questionnaire (as appropriate). Patients who have&#xD;
      abnormal overnight pulse oximetry readings will be assessed for sleep apnea. Immunogenicity&#xD;
      lab tests are completed only in the event of an Infusion Associated Reaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional Safety Assessment during Week 49 Visit. In addition to the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      assessments listed above, cervical spine radiographs (flexion-extension) or MRI or CT scan&#xD;
      will also be collected during the Week 49 visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Extension Phase [Required Safety and Recommended Efficacy Assessments]: Treatment Visits&#xD;
      Patients will be treated weekly with BMN110 starting at week 49, following completion of all&#xD;
      applicable efficacy assessments, until BMN110 becomes commercially available in Australia.&#xD;
      Patients will have vital signs, concomitant medications and AEs/SAEs collected at every&#xD;
      visit. Additional blood samples for total IgE and drug specific IgE testing will be drawn and&#xD;
      analyzed for patients who experience a severe IAR, experience an IAR requiring cessation of&#xD;
      infusion, anaphylaxis or a serious hypersensitivity event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessments: Treatment Visits [Every 4 weeks]. Body weight will be obtained every 4&#xD;
      weeks after the Day 1 visit to confirm dose volume. Treatment Visits [Every 24 weeks]. In&#xD;
      addition to the assessments performed at weekly treatment visits, the patients will undergo&#xD;
      pregnancy test (as appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Assessments [Recommended every 24 weeks starting with Week 73]: Routine physical&#xD;
      examination including standard neurological examination, clinical laboratory assessments,&#xD;
      urine KS and creatinine levels, ECG, 6MW test, 3MSC test, RFTs and anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements. The patients will also complete the APPT test, and PedsQL or SF-36&#xD;
      questionnaire (as appropriate), cervical spine imaging and sleep apnea test (if applicable).&#xD;
      Patients who have abnormal overnight pulse oximetry readings will be assessed for sleep&#xD;
      apnea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit (EOS). The patients will be monitored for AEs and SAEs for up to 30 days&#xD;
      post drug infusion. During Week 53 the EOS Visit, patients will be evaluated for AEs/SAEs and&#xD;
      will have vital signs taken, routine physical examination including standard neurological&#xD;
      examination will be performed, and information on concomitant medication use will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient withdrawal: Patients may withdraw voluntarily from receiving BMN 110 at any time, in&#xD;
      which case they will be encouraged to continue to undergo study assessments. Data from such&#xD;
      patients will be utilized for further characterization of the natural progression of MPS IVA.&#xD;
      Patients may also withdraw entirely from study participation at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety The study period during which all non-serious AEs and SAEs will be reported begins&#xD;
      after informed consent is obtained and through 30 days after the last study visit or 30 days&#xD;
      after the last drug infusion, whichever comes first. Starting on the first Screening Day and&#xD;
      continuing through the end of the study or Early Termination Visit , AEs/SAEs will be&#xD;
      monitored and recorded, and routine physical examination including standard neurological&#xD;
      examination will be conducted in all patients. During the Initial Phase, routine physical&#xD;
      examination including standard neurological examination will be conducted in all patients.&#xD;
      During the Extension phase, physical examinations including neurologic examinations are&#xD;
      recommended, but not required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some patients may experience infusion associated reactions (IARs) associated with the&#xD;
      administration of study drug, thus it will be required that prophylactic antihistamine will&#xD;
      be administered prior to each study drug infusion. Antipyretic pretreatment may be given at&#xD;
      the Investigator's discretion. The internal Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will monitor the&#xD;
      safety of BMN 110 in patients and may review any severe or serious IARs that occur in&#xD;
      patients during the study until approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration&#xD;
      or the European Medicines Agency to commercialize BMN 110 is received. Vital signs will be&#xD;
      measured just before, during, and immediately following the study drug infusion. Adverse&#xD;
      events and changes in concomitant medication Safety assessments will be performed throughout&#xD;
      the study. Physical examinations including neurological examination will be performed at&#xD;
      Screening and all visits up to and including the Week 49 Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiographs (flexion-extension) or MRI or CT scans of the cervical spine are required at&#xD;
      Screening and at Week 49. Clinical laboratory tests, Electrocardiograms (ECG) are required at&#xD;
      Screening, Baseline, Weeks 25 and 49 Visits. Blood samples will be collected at Baseline,&#xD;
      Weeks 25 and 49 for TAb and NAb testing. NAb will not be performed if TAb is negative.&#xD;
      Samples for Total IgE will be collected at Baseline and stored for testing. For patients who&#xD;
      experience a severe infusion associated reaction (IAR), experience an IAR requiring cessation&#xD;
      of infusion, anaphylaxis or a serious hypersensitivity event, shortly after cessation of the&#xD;
      infusion, the Baseline total IgE sample will be analyzed and additional blood samples for&#xD;
      total IgE and drug-specific IgE testing will be drawn and run. Immediate testing for total&#xD;
      IgE will be taken shortly after cessation of the study drug infusion. Drug-specific IgE will&#xD;
      also be tested, but must be collected no sooner than 8 hours post infusion and no later than&#xD;
      just before the next scheduled infusion the following week due to rhGALNS interference with&#xD;
      the detection assay. A sample taken the day after the IAR, anaphylactic or serious&#xD;
      hypersensitivity event would be preferred but may not be practical. If the sample is&#xD;
      positive, the extra volume of serum may be used to further characterize the drug-specific IgE&#xD;
      assay. As patients may experience hypersensitivity reactions associated with the&#xD;
      administration of BMN 110, all patients will be pretreated with an appropriate dose of&#xD;
      antihistamine medication approximately 30 minutes to 1 hour prior to infusion. Antipyretic&#xD;
      medications may also be given at the discretion of the Investigator. On infusion days, vital&#xD;
      signs will be measured at a minimum of: immediately before (less than 30 minutes) the&#xD;
      infusion, every 30 minutes for the first hour of the infusion, every hour for the remainder&#xD;
      of the infusion, and immediately (less than 30 minutes) after the infusion. Patients will&#xD;
      also be monitored by continuous pulse oximetry during infusion and for at least 60 minutes&#xD;
      after the infusion is completed. AEs/SAEs and changes in concomitant medication will be&#xD;
      recorded throughout the study. AEs/SAEs will be graded according to the National Cancer&#xD;
      Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE).&#xD;
