  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label, randomized, 3-way cross-over, and repeat administration study in&#xD;
      healthy male and female subjects. The purpose of the study is to determine the relative&#xD;
      bioavailability of Fluticasone Furoate (FF) and Levocabastine (LEV), when each is&#xD;
      administered alone and as FF/LEV Fixed Dose Combination (FDC).This study consists of Part A&#xD;
      (in which 30 subjects including 12 Korean subjects will be enrolled) and Part B (in which 18&#xD;
      subjects will be enrolled). Each part will consist of three treatment periods separated by a&#xD;
      minimum washout period of 14 days. In each treatment period, subjects will receive seven&#xD;
      daily doses of one of the 3 treatments: FF, LEV or FF/LEV FDC, via an intranasal spray&#xD;
      according to one of the 6 possible randomization sequences. The study will use an adaptive&#xD;
      design with an interim review following Part A to confirm whether Part B is required.&#xD;
