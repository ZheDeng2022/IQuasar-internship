&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 18 years - no upper limit of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Body weight &gt; 40 kg&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with an isolated ASD or PFO determined as suitable for closure via a&#xD;
             commercially available device&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In ASD patients, echocardiographic evidence of right ventricular overload, and a&#xD;
             stretched diameter of the defect up to 25 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In patients with PFO, echocardiographic evidence of right to left shunt, and&#xD;
             intraatrial tunnel length up to 4 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent, respectively ability to give written informed consent after&#xD;
             being told of the potential benefits and risks of entering the trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For female patients of child bearing capacity: Exclusion of pregnancy before start of&#xD;
             the study and willingness to use adequate contraceptive methods to prevent pregnancy&#xD;
             during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ASD/PFO larger than a stretched diameter of 25 mm, or defects unsuitable for&#xD;
             percutaneous closure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intraatrial tunnel longer than 4 mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Multiple or fenestrated ASD, ostium primum or sinus venosus atrial septal defect,&#xD;
             coronary sinus defect&#xD;

          -  Any significant cardiac valve dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anomalous pulmonary veins&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Defects with inadequate margins, as is consistent with current standards of care, such&#xD;
             that the device will not position appropriately so as to avoid interference with other&#xD;
             cardiac structure, or that will subject the device to increased risk of embolization&#xD;
             post deployment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Acquired pathological or congenital deficiencies of the cardiovascular system (any&#xD;
             other than ASD; e.g. transposition of vessels, calcification, myocardial infarction,&#xD;
             intracardiac thrombi), being clinically significant, respectively interfering in the&#xD;
             investigator's opinion with the conduct of study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant dilated cardiomyopathy (paroxysmal or caused by e.g.&#xD;
             myocarditis or other reasons)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any patient known to have extensive or complex congenital cardiac anomaly which can&#xD;
             only be adequately repaired by way of cardiac surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Echocardiographic evidence of thrombus in the left atrium, left atrial appendage, or&#xD;
             other cardiac chamber, and in the inferior vena cava.&#xD;

             systemic infection that has not been successfully treated prior to device placement&#xD;
&#xD;

             inadequate to accommodate the size of the device, the position controls or the&#xD;
             introduction sheath&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Documented history of bleeding, clotting or coagulation disorders, untreated ulcer or&#xD;
             any other contraindications to acetylsalicylic acid therapy, unless another&#xD;
             anti-platelet agent can be administered for 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypercoagulable state&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Anamnesis respectively diagnosis of pregnancy, or breastfeeding patients&#xD;

             safety evaluation as well as any severe concurrent illness that would limit life&#xD;
             expectancy (e.g. malignancies)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participation in an investigational drug or device trial within 30 days prior to&#xD;
             selection (day 0) or current inclusion in any other clinical trial or research project&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects who, in the opinion of the investigator, will be inappropriate for inclusion&#xD;
             into this clinical trial or will not comply with requirements of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are kept lawfully in an institution&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical investigations shall be conducted in vulnerable populations only when they&#xD;
             cannot be carried out in non-vulnerable populations and shall follow the additional&#xD;
             ethics committee procedures where applicable. These clinical investigations shall be&#xD;
             designed specifically to address health problems that occur in the vulnerable&#xD;
             population, and offer the possibility of direct health-related benefit to the&#xD;
             vulnerable population&#xD;
