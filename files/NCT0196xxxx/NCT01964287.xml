  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on conventional chemotherapy approach, data have indicated that the Folfirinox regimen&#xD;
      is more effective and tolerate than the treatment by Gemcitabine alone in patients with&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma. A recent study combining gemcitabine and nab paclitaxel&#xD;
      improve the objective response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of this study is to identify the maximun tolerated dose and the recommended&#xD;
      phase II dose of first line treatment combining gemcitabine plus nab-paclitaxel followed by&#xD;
      folfirinox in metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
