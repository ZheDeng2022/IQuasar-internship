      This type of study is called a radiolabeled study. For this study, LY3023703 (study drug) has&#xD;
      been specially prepared to contain radiolabeled carbon [14C]. [14C] is a naturally occurring&#xD;
      radioactive form of the element carbon. This study will help understand how the drug appears&#xD;
      in the blood, urine, and stool after it is administered to healthy men. Information about any&#xD;
      side effects that may occur will also be collected. This study will last up to 15 days for&#xD;
      each participant, not including screening. Screening is required within 28 days prior to the&#xD;
      start of the study.&#xD;
