      The purpose of this study is to determine a dose for future development and to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, and efficacy profiles of JNJ-42756493 in Japanese&#xD;
      and other Asian patients with advanced or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an open-label (identity of assigned study drug will be known), multicenter, 2-part,&#xD;
      Phase 1 dose escalation/expansion to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics (study of what the&#xD;
      body does to a drug), pharmacodynamics (study of what a drug does to the body) and clinical&#xD;
      activity of JNJ-42756493 administered orally once daily in 21-day cycles or 28 days cycles of&#xD;
      intermittent dosing regimen (7 days on/7 days off) to Japanese and Asian participants &gt;=20&#xD;
      years of age with advanced or refractory solid tumors or lymphoma who are not candidates for&#xD;
      approved or available therapies. Approximately 40 participants will be enrolled. In Part 1&#xD;
      Participants will be required to be hospitalized after the first dose on Day 1 of Cycle 1&#xD;
      until Day 2 of Cycle 2 (for daily continuous dosing) or until Day 14 of Cycle 1 (for&#xD;
      intermittent dosing), however extension of hospitalization will be allowed until Day 2 of&#xD;
      Cycle 2 according to investigators clinical judgment. The Part 1 dose-escalation phase is&#xD;
      designed to determine the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) based on safety, pharmacokinetic,&#xD;
      and pharmacodynamic data of JNJ-42756493. Participants will be enrolled in sequential cohorts&#xD;
      based on the 3+3 dose-escalation scheme; the first cohort will receive the starting dose and&#xD;
      subsequent cohorts will receive increased doses of JNJ-42756493. After the last participants&#xD;
      in each cohort completes Cycle 1, the Safety Evaluation Team (SET) will evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetic data according to protocol-defined criteria and make the decision whether&#xD;
      to escalate the dose in a new cohort. To determine the recommended Phase 2 dose, the SET will&#xD;
      review all safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic data from Part 1 before initiation of&#xD;
      Part 2. The total number of participants enrolled in Part 1 will depend on the dose level at&#xD;
      which the recommended Phase 2 dose is established. After the recommended Phase 2 dose is&#xD;
      established, the Part 2 dose-expansion phase will be opened. Part 2 study will be done in a&#xD;
      molecularly-defined subset of Participants with gastric adenocarcinoma including&#xD;
      gastroesophageal junctions at the RP2D. In Part2, Participants can be hospitalized until Day&#xD;
      8 of Cycle 1 as needed. In addition, extension of hospitalization will be allowed until Day&#xD;
      15 of Cycle 1 according to investigator's clinical judgment. In Part 2, approximately 25&#xD;
      participants will be treated at the recommended Phase 2 dose as 28 days cycles of&#xD;
      intermittent dosing regimen in order to evaluate fibroblast growth factor receptor target&#xD;
      modulation in tumor, to further elaborate safety, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of&#xD;
      JNJ-42756493, as well as to evaluate preliminary clinical responses. Participants who are&#xD;
      tolerating study drug treatment and achieve clinical responses or stable disease will&#xD;
      continue to receive study drug at the same dose until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, or withdrawal of consent. Serial pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic samples will&#xD;
      be collected, and safety and efficacy will be monitored throughout the study.&#xD;
