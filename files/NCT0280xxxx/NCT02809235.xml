  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this proof of concept study, the investigators aim to determine if supplementation with&#xD;
      coconut oil causes an increase in cholecystokinin and cholecystokinin receptor expression in&#xD;
      the airway smooth muscle of lean asthmatics, and whether these changes correlate with changes&#xD;
      in airway stiffness (estimated by bronchodilator reversibility, airway reactivity, and airway&#xD;
      resistance) or symptom control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a 5 week, single center trial in 20 lean patients with mild asthma&#xD;
      (not taking inhaled corticosteroids) aged 18 and older. Subjects will supplement their usual&#xD;
      diets with 3 tablespoons of coconut oil, a commercially available oil with high dodecanoic&#xD;
      acid content, for 3 weeks. To quantify changes in airway smooth muscle cholecystokinin and&#xD;
      cholecystokinin-receptor expression, each subject will undergo bronchoscopy with&#xD;
      endobronchial biopsies before and after coconut oil ingestion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the secondary analysis, subjects will also complete spirometry with bronchodilator&#xD;
      testing, methacholine challenge, body plethysmography, and an Asthma Control Questionnaire&#xD;
      (ACQ) before and after the dietary intervention. This information will be used to compare the&#xD;
      changes in airway smooth muscle cholecystokinin and cholecystokinin receptor expression to&#xD;
      changes in bronchodilator reversibility, airway reactivity, airway resistance, and symptom&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the exploratory aims, the investigators will correlate the changes in airway smooth muscle&#xD;
      cholecystokinin and cholecystokinin receptor expression with changes in FEV1 and peak flow&#xD;
      measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore hope to elucidate information about the mechanistic role of&#xD;
      cholecystokinin in airway smooth muscle stiffness and contraction.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      20 lean (BMI&lt;25) nonsmokers at least 18 years of age with mild asthma will be recruited from&#xD;
      the Asthma Research Center database. A sample size of 12 asthmatics is needed to have 80%&#xD;
      power to detect a 3-fold increase in cholecystokinin (CCK) post dodecanoic acid ingestion at&#xD;
      alpha level of 0.05, assuming the standard deviation is ≤2.25 in cycle scale. To account for&#xD;
      probable incomplete retention, 20 subjects will be recruited. While the calculated standard&#xD;
      deviation is 1.775, the investigators chose to base our calculations off of a larger standard&#xD;
      deviation because of our small sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be asked to come to 5 visits, described in detail below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1: Eligibility Screen Pre-screened Volunteers will be asked not to take their short&#xD;
      acting bronchodilators or ipratropium within 6 hours of this visit. They will complete a&#xD;
      medical history that includes detailed information about past and current asthma medications,&#xD;
      ACQ, physical exam with weight/BMI check and spirometry with bronchodilator testing. They&#xD;
      will undergo body plethysmography to measure baseline airway resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: Eligibility Screen, methacholine challenge Subjects will return at any point during&#xD;
      the 1-4 weeks allowed between visits 1 and 3. They will be told to not to take their short&#xD;
      acting bronchodilators or ipratropium within 8 hours of this visit and to avoid caffeine&#xD;
      (coffee, tea, cola drinks, and chocolate) the day of the visit. This visit will be short,&#xD;
      comprised only of a methacholine challenge, to measure baseline airway reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Bronchoscopy Eligible subjects will be asked not to take aspirin, anticoagulant&#xD;
      (e.g., warfarin) or antiplatelet (e.g., clopidogrel) medication in the 7 days prior to this&#xD;
      second visit. They will also be told not to eat or drink within 6hrs of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the visit, subjects will be instructed on how to use a peak flow meter.&#xD;
      Baseline peak flow measurements will be recorded. They will then undergo bronchoscopy with&#xD;
      endobronchial biopsy. The investigators will perform laser capture on the biopsy samples to&#xD;
      isolate the smooth muscle cells and quantify the cells' CCK and cholecystokinin receptor&#xD;
      (CCK-AR) content via quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study participants will then be instructed to supplement their usual diets with 3&#xD;
      tablespoons of coconut oil (about 21.6g dodecanoic acid, 375 calories) daily for three weeks.&#xD;
      The oil should be consumed uncooked so that its chemical form is unaltered. It can be&#xD;
      swallowed by tablespoon or mixed into/spread on foods. The investigators recommend that it&#xD;
      take the place of other fatty foods rather than be added to each subject's diet, so that&#xD;
      subjects' overall daily caloric intake does not increase (and so that subjects do not gain&#xD;
      weight).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The average adult ingests 0.8g of dodecanoic acid daily, according to a 2004 NHANES report.&#xD;
      Dodecanoic acid is present at particularly high concentration in coconut oil (50% dodecanoic&#xD;
      acid by weight). While the degree to which ingested dodecanoic acid reaches plasma and airway&#xD;
      smooth muscle cells is unknown, prior trials confirm rise in plasma concentration of similar&#xD;
      fatty acids (including gama linolenic acid, stearidonic acid, alpha linolenic acid, and&#xD;
      eicosapentaenoic acid) after supplementation with as little as 0.25-4g daily for 3 weeks. The&#xD;
      investigators have chosen to maximize the supplemented dose (to about 20g) so that any&#xD;
      possible effect of dodecanoic acid on the airway smooth muscle is not missed. The 3 week&#xD;
      duration is modeled after the aforementioned studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will provide each subject with a Drug Diary and peak flow meter. Subjects&#xD;
      will be instructed to keep track of their daily coconut oil ingestion and peak flow&#xD;
      measurements. They will be told to measure peak flow daily between 5 and 11 am, prior to the&#xD;
      use of any morning inhalers, and to call the study coordinators if they experience a change&#xD;
      in their asthma symptoms or if their measurements drop by more than 20% of their baseline. In&#xD;
      addition, a study investigator will call each subject weekly to encourage compliance and to&#xD;
      ensure that the subject has no questions or adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 4: Followup exam, ACQ, pulmonary function tests After 3 weeks of coconut oil ingestion,&#xD;
      subjects will return for a repeat physical exam with weight/BMI check and methacholine&#xD;
      challenge. They will fill out a second ACQ and continue to supplement their diet with coconut&#xD;
      oil until visit 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 5: Followup pulmonary function tests, second bronchoscopy Subjects will return 1-3 days&#xD;
      later for visit 5. They will again be told not to take aspirin, anticoagulant (e.g.,&#xD;
      warfarin) or antiplatelet (e.g., clopidogrel) medication in the 7 days prior to this final&#xD;
      visit, and not to eat or drink within 6hrs of the visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will formally review each subject's Drug Diary and peak flow measurements.&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo spirometry, bronchodilator reversibility testing, body&#xD;
      plethysmography, and bronchoscopy with endobronchial biopsy. The investigators will process&#xD;
      the samples and compare the post-fatty acid ingestion outcomes to the baseline values.&#xD;
