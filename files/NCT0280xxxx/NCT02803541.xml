      Purpose: Most children and adolescents with chronic kidney disease (CKD) have much less&#xD;
      physical endurance than their age matched peers, are at high risk for premature&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, and have a poor self image in part due to limited peer contact.&#xD;
      Sustained exercise in adults with CKD improves endurance and decreases cardiovascular risk.&#xD;
      Minimal data exists in pediatric CKD patients. This study will show whether 12 days of&#xD;
      increased exercise at a summer camp will improve endurance as measured by the distance walked&#xD;
      in 6 minutes and self concept as measured by a short standardized questionaire (Harter&#xD;
      scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will occur at the Frost Valley YMCA in the Catskills where in 2, 12 day sessions a&#xD;
      total of 25-30 kidney campers are mainstreamed in the general camp population of about 500.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mainstreaming means that the kidney camper will live in a cabin with 8-10 age matched peers&#xD;
      and participate as much as possible in all camp activities with their bunkmates. The kidney&#xD;
      program at Frost Valley provides hemo and peritoneal dialysis, as well as caring for children&#xD;
      with less advanced CKD and post transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have activity measured before and duringcamp by wearing a pedometer. The&#xD;
      distance walked in 6 minutes (a 6 minutewalk test) will be measured at onset and completion&#xD;
      of the 12 day camp experience. A standardized questionaire on self concept will also be&#xD;
      administered at the onset and completion of camp.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children and adolescents with CKD have high rates of hospitalization, and those with&#xD;
      End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) have a remaining life expectancy of about 20 years with&#xD;
      increased risk of premature death due to cardiovascular disease. Most have much less physical&#xD;
      endurance than their age matched peers with the degree of underperformance loosely correlated&#xD;
      with the severity of their renal disease. Cardiovascular disease, chronic inflammation,&#xD;
      anemia, low muscular strength and/or bone disease are among the factors considered&#xD;
      responsible for the poor physical conditioning. However, the investigators hypothesize that&#xD;
      the most important cause is inactivity caused by a varying combination of parental&#xD;
      'protection', limited or poor peer inaction, and patient choice. In addition, children who&#xD;
      require chronic hemodialysis have an enforced 10-14 hours weekly of enforced inactivity.&#xD;
      Cardiovascular morbidity is commonly associated with chronic kidney disease and physical&#xD;
      endurance is a measure of cardiovascular health. In addition many children with chronic&#xD;
      kidney disease demonstrate poor self-concept, in part related to their lack of physical&#xD;
      endurance and limited peer contact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies of adults with chronic kidney disease have documented poor physical&#xD;
      conditioning and function. Over the past decade, many studies have demonstrated in adults&#xD;
      with CKD a significant benefit of regular exercise on physical fitness, walking capacity,&#xD;
      blood pressure, and health related quality of life. Several small studies have shown a modest&#xD;
      improvement in children and adolescents with CKD but these studies have had high drop-out&#xD;
      rates and problematic compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2012 study by Akber et al using pedometer measurements showed that over a 7 day period,&#xD;
      children, adolescents, and young adults with CKD (n=44) on average walked about 50% less than&#xD;
      expected using data collected by NHANES as a standard. Females walked less than males and&#xD;
      older children were less active than younger children. On a 6 minute walk test, males scored&#xD;
      &lt; 2 standard deviation below the expected mean and females &lt;4 standard deviation below the&#xD;
      mean. There was no measured difference between stage of CKD, dialysis, or transplant status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 1975 the Ruth Gottscho Kidney Foundation partnered with the Albert Einstein College of&#xD;
      Medicine and the Frost Valley YMCA to develop the first summer camp program capable of&#xD;
      performing hemodialysis and caring for children with chronic kidney disease. One of the&#xD;
      guiding principles of this program is that kidney campers (as well as some children with&#xD;
      other chronic illnesses) are mainstreamed in with the general camp population and participate&#xD;
      in the same activities as their age matched peers. Each summer, there are 4 two week camp&#xD;
      session with about 500 campers attending each session. The program has run each summer since&#xD;
      1975, and the enrollment of kidney campers has varied from 25 to 50 each summer. The Frost&#xD;
      Valley YMCA is located in the Catskill Mountains approximately 120 miles from New York City&#xD;
      and is spread over about 2000 acres.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informal observation of the kidney campers indicates that many show improved physical&#xD;
      endurance during their camp stay, and a study done early in the program's history&#xD;
      demonstrated an improved self-esteem. , A study using the Piers Harris test of self-concept&#xD;
      evaluated 24 chronic dialysis children during the Summer of 1976 and compared them to 76&#xD;
      regular campers. On arrival at camp the dialysis campers had a lower self-concept than the&#xD;
      regular campers (P&lt;.01). The same children were evaluated at the end of camp. Both groups&#xD;
      improved their self-concept (P&lt;0.02) but the dialysis campers showed greater improvement.&#xD;
      (P&lt;0.01) This study was presented at the 1977 Clinical Dialysis and Transplant Forum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that during their time at camp the kidney campers will improve&#xD;
      their physical endurance and their self-concept; which will be assessed objectively through&#xD;
      physical fitness/function and psychometric assessments. The investigators hope to do this in&#xD;
      a way that interferes as little as possible with the camp experience yet is educational and&#xD;
      fun for the kidney campers and their peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate objective of this pilot study is to increase awareness that children with CKD&#xD;
      should be physically active, can enjoy being part of a program with their peers, and may&#xD;
      benefit physically and mentally from it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study designed in close collaboration between the UNC Kidney Center and the UNC&#xD;
      Department of Exercise Science and will occur during the first two 12 day camp sessions at&#xD;
      the Frost Valley YMCA during the Summer of 2016.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Campers range in age from 8 to 17 years. Each kidney camper and age matched healthy controls&#xD;
      (bunkmates) will be provided with a pedometer before camp arrival and will be asked to wear&#xD;
      it throughout each day in the week before camp in order to record their physical activity&#xD;
      level. Participants will also be asked to record screen time during the week prior to&#xD;
      beginning the camp. Participants will be asked to wear the pedometer during their camp stay,&#xD;
      except during waterfront activities, and the data recorded. The investigators hope to enroll&#xD;
      all kidney campers (estimate 25-40 individuals) and approximately 70-100 control campers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Omron 321 pedometer was chosen because it retains seven-days of data, is inexpensive, and&#xD;
      has been previously shown to be a valid and reliable indicator of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the day of, or the first day after camp arrival, each kidney camper along with his/her&#xD;
      bunkmates will be asked to complete a 6 minute walk test (6MWT). A standardized chart to&#xD;
      self-report their perceived exertion at the end of the walk will be used. Pulse upon&#xD;
      completion of the 6MWT and 1 minute later will be measured. Each child will wear a portable&#xD;
      pulse oximeter during the walk. The investigators hypothesize that the kidney campers will&#xD;
      increase their activity at camp compared to their activity at home as measured by the&#xD;
      pedometer, and also that they will be able to ambulate further as measured by the 6MWT with&#xD;
      less perceived exertion and possibly lower post 6MWT pulse rate at the end of the camp&#xD;
      session as compared to the beginning of camp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6MWT test was chosen as the primary test measurement in consultation with the Exercise&#xD;
      Science Department faculty and camp administrative staff as there is considerable normative&#xD;
      data in healthy children, it is non-invasive, and its administration can easily fit into the&#xD;
      camp program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Having the kidney campers participate with their bunkmates in the 6MWT will provide&#xD;
      motivation for campers to perform at as high a level as possible, yet not single the kidney&#xD;
      campers out as special or specifically as research subjects. Research data will be collected&#xD;
      only for those campers for whom consent/assent has been obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Similarly, data for the control campers will be instructive as to whether a relatively short&#xD;
      period of increased activity (12 days) will allow measured changes in their 6MWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be time efficient and fit in with the camp environment, rather than the standard&#xD;
      6MWT which is classically done in a hallway between 2 cones separated by 20 meters, the&#xD;
      campers will walk (not run) along the camp circle from approximately the laundry area to&#xD;
      Biscuit Hall (modified 6MWT). This is a relatively level paved path (net elevation rise ~15&#xD;
      feet) about 1500 feet in distance and is estimated to take the average camper about 6&#xD;
      minutes. Any who reach Biscuit Hall earlier, will do laps around Biscuit until the 6 minutes&#xD;
      is up. The course will be carefully measured and marked so that distances achieved will be&#xD;
      accurately ascertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6MWT will be repeated in the identical fashion shortly before the end of the camp&#xD;
      session, at approximately the same time of day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any child who becomes unusually fatigued during the modified 6MWT, will be encouraged to rest&#xD;
      until he or she is ready to continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A short standardized survey to measure self-concept will be given to the kidney campers and&#xD;
      to control campers to be completed upon arrival and shortly prior to leaving camp using the&#xD;
      Harter Self Perception Profile for Children (SPPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Camp physical forms will be used to determine age, weight, and height for control campers and&#xD;
      be directly measured for the kidney campers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICS The primary data collected will be the distance traveled on the 6MWT. Each child&#xD;
      will serve as his/her own control for paired t-test analysis. Secondary data, which will&#xD;
      emphasize the kidney campers, will be perceived exertion and self concept. In both groups, if&#xD;
      possible, correlations will be drawn between activity levels prior to camp, performance on&#xD;
      the 6MWT, and measurement of self-concept. Also, group analyses will be done with comparisons&#xD;
      to previously published standard data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a pilot project and little data exists on the activity levels of children with&#xD;
      kidney disease and no similar study has ever been done, it is difficult to predict what&#xD;
      changes in activity will be seen. Consequently power calculations are not provided.&#xD;
      Similarly, most studies of exercise use periods considerably longer than 12 days, so it is&#xD;
      possible that 12 days is insufficient to see a measureable change in the 6MWT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although all campers in the bunk or village will be asked to participate in the 6MWT, only&#xD;
      data from those campers whose families have provided consent and campers who have provided&#xD;
      assent will be used for analysis. If sufficient non-kidney campers participate, data can be&#xD;
      analyzed in a similar manner to measure the impact of the camp experience on their physical&#xD;
      fitness and self-concept. In this situation, data regarding screen time pre camp as well as&#xD;
      the pedometer measurements pre-camp may be instructive.&#xD;

    <description>Harter Self Perception Profile for Children (SPPC) consists of 36 items representing five domains of self-esteem (i.e., scholastic competence, social acceptance, athletic competence, physical appearance, and behavioral conduct, as well as global self-worth). Each SPPC item consists of two opposite descriptions. Respondents choose the best fitting description indicating whether the description is &quot;somewhat true&quot; or &quot;very true&quot; for them. Items are scored on a four-point scale with a higher score reflecting a more positive view of oneself. The scale will be modified since the scholastic competence domain will not be included because the study is occurring during summer school vacation.</description>
