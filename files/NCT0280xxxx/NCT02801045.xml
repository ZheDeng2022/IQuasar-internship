    <textblock>
      This study evaluates from the patient's perspective which elements of the own artistic&#xD;
      creative process are the source of a beneficial change for him/her and how those elements&#xD;
      influence in their end of life experience.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In previous quantitative studies about the effect of an art therapy intervention in adult&#xD;
      cancer inpatients of the Palliative Care Unit, the investigators evidenced significant&#xD;
      improvements in the symptom control of malaise, anxiety, depression and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to deepen the understanding of specific action mechanisms which lead&#xD;
      to those therapeutic benefits and quality of life implications for patients with&#xD;
      life-threatening illness in which a situation of suffering is frequently detected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will determine from the subjective patient's experience which specific&#xD;
      elements of the artistic creative process (including production of art and art products) may&#xD;
      lead to changes in the symptom perception, in meaning and healing process and in the personal&#xD;
      perspective about the end of life situation.&#xD;

    <time_frame>After the making of a minimum of 5 art pieces, an average of 2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>An art based interview is administered and involves the patients selecting 2 significant artworks from their art therapy productions.
