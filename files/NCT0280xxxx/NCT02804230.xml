      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial effectiveness&#xD;
      of Exablate thermal ablation of a focal epileptic target area in the brain of patients&#xD;
      suffering from medication-refractory epilepsy, using the Exablate transcranial system to&#xD;
      produce multiple sonications targeted in the focus of interest. The investigators will&#xD;
      establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of&#xD;
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and initial effectiveness&#xD;
      of Exablate thermal ablation of a focal epileptic target area in the brain of patients&#xD;
      suffering from medication-refractory epilepsy, using the Exablate transcranial system to&#xD;
      produce multiple sonications targeted in the lesion of interest. The Investigators will&#xD;
      establish the feasibility and collect data to establish the basic safety of this type of&#xD;
      treatment as the basis for later studies that will evaluate its full clinical efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses tested are that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. MRgFUS treatment of focal epilepsy is feasible and safe, with a low risk of adverse&#xD;
           effects as evaluated during the follow-up period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Exablate treatment of foci in patients with focal epilepsy reduces the seizure&#xD;
           frequency.&#xD;
