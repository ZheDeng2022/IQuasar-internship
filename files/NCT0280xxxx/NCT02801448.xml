  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Type 2 diabetes (T2D) results from a combination of insufficient insulin secretion from&#xD;
      pancreatic islets and insulin resistance of target cells. The investigators have extensive&#xD;
      pre-clinical data suggesting that BSE through its high content of the isothiocyanate&#xD;
      sulforaphane improves hepatic insulin sensitivity. BSE as a dietary supplement could&#xD;
      therefore benefit both patients with T2D and individuals at risk for the disease.&#xD;
      BSE-containing sulforaphane is suggested to activate Nuclear factor-like 2 (NRF2). The&#xD;
      investigators aim to study the clinical effect of using BSE as a dietary supplement on&#xD;
      glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sulforaphane binds to Keap1 in the cytosol, leading to nuclear translocation of this&#xD;
      transcription factor. In the nucleus NRF2 induces the expression of a large number of&#xD;
      anti-oxidative genes. Sulforaphane is contained at high concentration in broccoli sprout&#xD;
      extracts (BSE). Human studies have been conducted using broccoli sprout products without&#xD;
      complication. It is being tested for the treatment or prevention of cancer and inflammatory&#xD;
      diseases in ~30 clinical trials without any serious adverse events reported. The low toxicity&#xD;
      makes BSE ideal as a dietary supplement for preventing and treating T2D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to study the clinical effect of sulforaphane on glucose tolerance in&#xD;
      T2D patients. Sulforaphane will be given as BSE. BSE is a freeze-dried powder of an aqueous&#xD;
      extract of broccoli sprouts that provides a consistent and stable source of sulforaphane. The&#xD;
      investigators will use a parallel arm study design with patients receiving BSE or placebo.&#xD;
      The randomization will be double-blind. The study will be done at one centre. Patients with&#xD;
      BMI between 25-40 kg/m2 will be included. Another inclusion criterion is HbA1c 6-10%.&#xD;
      Patients will be treated for 12 weeks to enable us to observe effects on HbA1c (HbA1c&#xD;
      turn-over is 3 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will come to a screening visit and if they give informed consent and are included&#xD;
      they attend a second visit 2-3 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will undergo an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) before and after the 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period. The reason for using OGTT rather than e.g. insulin clamps as the readout is&#xD;
      that it is a harmless standard procedure that gives an integrated view of glucose tolerance.&#xD;
