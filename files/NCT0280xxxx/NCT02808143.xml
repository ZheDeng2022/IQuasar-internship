    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy (the effect of drug on tumor) and the&#xD;
      tolerability (the effect of drug on the body) of pembrolizumab, when given as a single agent&#xD;
      in patients with bladder tumors. Another purpose of the study is to see what tumor&#xD;
      characteristics are associated with increased efficacy of the pembrolizumab. Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      (MK-3475) is an antibody (a human protein that sticks to a part of the tumor and/or immune&#xD;
      cells) designed to allow the body's immune system to work against tumor cells. Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      is Food and drug Administration (FDA) approved for the treatment of advanced melanoma (a type&#xD;
      of skin cancer) and some types of lung cancer. It is not yet approved by the United States&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (USFDA) for bladder cancer, hence it is considered an&#xD;
      investigational agent for this disease.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of the study drug (pembrolizumab [MK-3475])&#xD;
      when administered intravesically in combination with BCG in patients with high risk or&#xD;
      BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer (up to the individual maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose of each drug alone).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To describe the dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) of MK-3475 in combination with BCG in this&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the safety and tolerability of the combination of MK-3475 and BCG in subjects&#xD;
      with high risk or BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERTIARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of MK-3475 in both blood and urine when&#xD;
      administered intravesically in combination with BCG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To measure humoral and cellular responses to tumor antigens on serum and urine samples by&#xD;
      measuring the levels of cytokines (ie, interleukin [IL]-2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-18,&#xD;
      interferon gamma [IFN-gamma] and tumor necrosis factor alpha [TNF-alpha]) and peripheral&#xD;
      blood lymphocyte phenotype throughout treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To determine the response rate in terms of complete pathologic response in this&#xD;
      population assessed when patient undergoes cystoscopies (weeks 17, 25, 33, 41, and 49 if&#xD;
      applicable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To document the progression rate associated with the combination of intravesical MK-3475&#xD;
      and BCG in patients with high risk or BCG-refractory non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To evaluate the relationship between tumor biomarkers programmed cell death (PD)-ligand&#xD;
      (L)1, PD-L2, PD-1 as defined by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and adverse effects and recurrence&#xD;
      rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PRE-INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravesically once on day -14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION PHASE: Patients receive BCG solution intravesically once weekly for 6 weeks at&#xD;
      weeks 0-5 and pembrolizumab intravesically every 2 weeks at weeks 0, 2, and 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MAINTENANCE PHASE: Beginning 2 weeks after the last dose of BCG solution, patients receive&#xD;
      pembrolizumab intravesically every 2 weeks for 12 weeks at weeks 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, and 17 for&#xD;
      a total of 6 doses. Patients then receive pembrolizumab intravesically every 4 weeks at weeks&#xD;
      21, 25, 29, 33, 37, 41, 45, and 49 for a total of 8 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months for 2 years,&#xD;
      every 4 months for 2 years, every 6 months for 2 years, and then annually thereafter.&#xD;
