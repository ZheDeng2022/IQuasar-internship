      1. Burden: Anaemia is a public health problem in our country. Fifty one percent young&#xD;
           children aged 6 to 59 months are suffering from anaemia in Bangladesh (BDHS-2011) and&#xD;
           the main cause of this problem is iron deficiency. Research findings show that Iron&#xD;
           deficiency leads to delayed development and even reduce working capacity. All these&#xD;
           impact negatively on quality of life and loss of national gross domestic product (GDP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Knowledge gap: Little is known about long-term effects of early life iron deficiency&#xD;
           anemia on development and behaviour of children after correction with iron supplements.&#xD;
           There is also scarcity of information if early life psychosocial stimulation added to&#xD;
           iron supplementation to these anemic children have long term benefits compared to&#xD;
           non-stimulated anaemic children or non-anaemic children&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim was to conduct a follow up study to examine whether the IDA children, who&#xD;
           recovered from iron deficiency and received additional more intense psychosocial&#xD;
           intervention catch up to their optimum development in later life at school age, similar&#xD;
           like non-anaemic peers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Hypothesis (if any):&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. The benefit of early iron supplementation in addition to Psychosocial stimulation&#xD;
                on growth and development of IDA infants appears in later life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Addition of early psychosocial stimulation in treated IDA children help them catch&#xD;
                up to their non-anemic peers in development over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Study Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. To determine the long term effect of early psychosocial stimulation provided at the&#xD;
                age of 6-24 months in addition to iron treatment in IDA children on their growth&#xD;
                (height, weight and Head Circumference), IQ, executive function, school&#xD;
                achievement, fine motor, memory and behaviour&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. To compare the growth and development of IDA infants with non-anemic infants after&#xD;
                7 years of an intervention with iron supplementation and psychosocial stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: All children who participated in the iron and stimulation study at the age of 6 to 24&#xD;
      months (n=424).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of sample: Using the addresses and by tracking through available mobile phone&#xD;
      numbers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current follow-up, at the age of around 8-9 years all the available children will be&#xD;
      measured for:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  WASI: The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence - Second Edition (WASI-II)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Millions of young children in developing countries have developmental deficits due to some&#xD;
      preventable factors like poor nutrition, lack of a stimulating environment, and poverty.&#xD;
      Although Bangladesh is doing well in achieving MDGs, still poor nutrition, poverty and poor&#xD;
      parental education are prevalent. These mutually exclusive factors have an implication not&#xD;
      only for the individuals' future but also for national income and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usually, iron deficiency in the neonatal period and early childhood is considered a key to&#xD;
      the development of disturbances in cognitive development. There is increasing evidence that&#xD;
      iron deficiency anemia detrimentally affects children's development. Many cross sectional&#xD;
      studies have shown that iron deficiency is associated with poor psycho motor development and&#xD;
      behavioral deficits in young children, and poor cognition and school achievement in&#xD;
      school-aged children. However, anemia is associated with many adverse social and economic&#xD;
      family circumstances which may adversely affect children's development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nutrition along with early child development interventions can have additive or synergistic&#xD;
      effects on child development, and in some cases, nutritional outcomes. Meta analysis, studies&#xD;
      conducted in low, middle and high income countries in randomized controlled trials among&#xD;
      primary school aged children (5-12 years) showed that concurrent iron supplementation&#xD;
      improved global cognitive scores and growth and reduced risk of anemia and iron deficiency&#xD;
      among anemic children by 50% and 75% respectively. According to the Lancet reviews on child&#xD;
      development iron deficiency anemia during early childhood, when brain growth spurt occurs is&#xD;
      one of the identified risk factor for later development. Similarly early psycho social&#xD;
      stimulation acts as a protective factor in optimizing later development. Studies in Indonesia&#xD;
      and Canada both found benefits from iron treatment to infants' motor development but not to&#xD;
      mental development. It has been suggested that the poor level of mental development found in&#xD;
      IDA infants may be irreversible in some circumstances. One systematic review and meta&#xD;
      analysis revealed that daily iron supplementation in 2 to 5 years children increases&#xD;
      hemoglobin and ferretin but has limited evidence in cognitive development and physical&#xD;
      growth..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anemia is a public health problem in Bangladesh where 51% of young children aged 6 to 59&#xD;
      months are suffering and the main cause of this problem is iron deficiency. A study conducted&#xD;
      in Bangladesh found a non significant benefit to motor development from iron alone however&#xD;
      the power of the study was extremely limited and the group receiving iron and zinc benefited&#xD;
      in motor development. We also conducted a cluster randomized controlled trial in 2007-2008 on&#xD;
      6-24 months old iron deficient anemic (IDA) and non- anemic non-iron deficient (NANI)&#xD;
      children with iron supplementation to IDA children for 6 months and weekly psycho social&#xD;
      stimulation to all children in the stimulation clusters for 9 months in Bangladesh. The&#xD;
      result showed that although the intervened IDA group recovered from their iron deficient&#xD;
      status after 9 months, hey had significantly lower psycho motor development index (PDI) and&#xD;
      responsiveness to the examiner compared to NANI group. Random-effects multilevel regressions&#xD;
      of the developmental scores showed that psycho social stimulation improved children's mental&#xD;
      development Index (MDI) in both the group. Interaction between iron status and stimulation&#xD;
      showed a suggestive trend indicating that children with IDA and NANI responded differently to&#xD;
      stimulation, i.e. the IDA group improved less than the NANI group. During that time we&#xD;
      predicted that benefit of Iron supplementation and psycho social stimulation on children may&#xD;
      appear in later life with application of more sensitive measurement tools for intelligence.&#xD;
      The present study provides us a unique opportunity to examine long term effect of early iron&#xD;
      supplementation and psycho social stimulation on growth and development of iron deficient&#xD;
      anemic children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. The benefit of early iron supplementation in addition to Psycho social stimulation on&#xD;
      growth and development of IDA infants appears in later life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Addition of early psycho social stimulation in treated IDA children help them catch up to&#xD;
      their non-anemic peers in development over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objective(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the long term effect of early psycho social stimulation provided at the age&#xD;
           of 6-24 months in addition to iron treatment in IDA children on their growth (height,&#xD;
           weight and Head Circumference), IQ, executive function, school achievement, fine motor&#xD;
           and behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the growth and development of IDA infants with non-anemic infants after 7&#xD;
           years of an intervention with iron supplementation and psycho social stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Setting Location: 30 villages of Monohardi Upazilla under Narsingdi district. Study&#xD;
      design: Follow-up of a cluster randomized controlled trial. In the original study&#xD;
      randomization was done at village level for psycho social stimulation. Two hundred and twelve&#xD;
      children (106 anemic and 106 non anemic) aged 6-12 months in the &quot;stimulation-villages (S)&quot;&#xD;
      received age specific psycho social stimulation and 212 children of &quot;non-stimulation villages&#xD;
      (NS: 106 anemic and 106 non anemic) were enrolled as controls. Mild and moderately anemic (Hb&#xD;
      80.0-109 g/L) and iron deficient (ferritin &lt;12 μg/L) children of all the assigned villages&#xD;
      (both S and NS) received ferrous-sulphate (Fe2SO4) syrup. Children were considered non-anemic&#xD;
      if they had Hb&gt;110 g/L and ferritin levels ≥12 μg/L. For all groups parental education were&#xD;
      less than X grade.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample: All children who participated in the original study at the age of 6 to 24 months and&#xD;
      can be located will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IDA group: All the children who were identified as IDA during early childhood (6-24 months)&#xD;
      based on Hb level between 80-110 g/L and sTfR levels ≥ 5.0 mg/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-anemic group: All the children who were identified as NANI during early childhood based&#xD;
      on Hb &gt;110g/L and sTfR &lt;5.0 mg/L) living in the same rural areas. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification of sample: the study will try to track the children through their addresses&#xD;
      and available mobile phone numbers that are registered during their enrollment. The study&#xD;
      will also contact the local staff who worked as the play leaders and health workers and had&#xD;
      close contact with the families to help us locate the children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: In the original study the villages with at least 12 children (6 IDA and 6&#xD;
      NANI) aged 6-24 months were selected and randomly assigned to either psycho social&#xD;
      stimulation or non-stimulation groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention In the original study all anemic children in early childhood received 30 mg&#xD;
      ferrous sulfate daily based on recommendations from both the WHO and IOM reports for 6&#xD;
      months. The psycho social intervention lasted for 9 months and included play demonstrations&#xD;
      at home by a play leader (PL) who was trained to visit homes and teach the mothers about&#xD;
      child development and care practices. The study showed the mothers how to play with children&#xD;
      using toys in a way to promote good child development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan of work: After taking written consent, the identified mothers and children will be&#xD;
      interviewed for home based measurements (SES, HOME &amp; SDQ) by team of two members - one&#xD;
      trained testers (graduates in psychology or social science) and one health worker (high&#xD;
      school graduate). The mother will be invited to come along with their children to the test&#xD;
      centers (centrally located in the village) for developmental and anthropocentric assessments.&#xD;
      The same tester will conduct the psychological assessments of the children while the health&#xD;
      worker will assist in bringing and testing them. The testers and health workers will be&#xD;
      unaware about the intervention group (blinded). Four teams will start assessments at the same&#xD;
      time in 4 villages and rotate to the next after completing one. it is assumed that the&#xD;
      testers will complete assessment of 10-12 children in one village in approximately two and&#xD;
      half days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current follow-up, at the age of around 8-9 years all the available children will be&#xD;
      measured for:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • WASI: The Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence - Second Edition (WASI-II), a revision&#xD;
      of the WASI, provides a brief, reliable measure of cognitive ability for use in clinical,&#xD;
      educational and research settings. It consists of four sub tests: Vocabulary, Block Design,&#xD;
      Similarities and Matrix Reasoning. Scores of these sub tests lead to calculate performance IQ&#xD;
      (PIQ), verbal IQ (VIQ) as well as a full scale IQ (FSIQ). The average reliability&#xD;
      coefficients of the WASI subtest range from .87 to .92 for the overall children's sample&#xD;
      (Guilford1954 and Nunnally 1978). WASI has been used by this group in Bangladesh previously&#xD;
      and was culturally adapted before use. The adapted and translated version has been assessed&#xD;
      for face validity before use and showed meaningful correlation with nutritional and&#xD;
      socio-economic variables (Ali- personal communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous study conducted by us showed that cognitive testing of pictures, piloted the&#xD;
      original test on 35 children in Gaibandha and 20 children in Dhaka, and re-ranked the items&#xD;
      according to difficulty. The test retest reliability of the adapted tool ranged from 0.77 to&#xD;
      0.86 for different subscales.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  School achievement: Children's school achievement will be measured using a locally&#xD;
           developed test based on the 'wide range achievement test (WRAT) that measures&#xD;
           mathematics, reading, writing and comprehension abilities. In addition their grade&#xD;
           level, number of grades repeated, attendance in school, age of enrolment at primary&#xD;
           school, age of leaving school, preschool attendance etc. will also be measured. This&#xD;
           test has been used by a member of our group in a previous intervention study in rural&#xD;
           Bangladesh and was sensitive to changes in serum iodine. This adapted version of school&#xD;
           achievement test showed good face validity before testing. It also showed high&#xD;
           concurrent validity (r=0.71) with Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC-IV) at&#xD;
           10 years and moderately high predictive validity (r=0.54) of Wechsler Preschool and&#xD;
           Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI) used at 5 years in our recently completed cohort&#xD;
           study in Bangladesh (Tofail -personal communication). It also showed meaningful&#xD;
           correlation with socio-economic variables, parental education and children's nutritional&#xD;
           status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Number Stroop: The number Stroop measures executive function of the children. It is a&#xD;
           psychological test for mental (selective attention) vitality and flexibility. It has&#xD;
           been used in Bangladesh in another study in Gaibandha where it picked up intervention&#xD;
           effects (Ali- personal communication). We also used a modified word and color stroop&#xD;
           test in Matlab that showed reasonable concurrent validity (r&gt; 0.45) with other cognitive&#xD;
           measures and socio-demographic variables .We will conduct a pilot test for number stroop&#xD;
           in this study to assess face validity and test -retest reliability before using.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Strength and difficulties questionnaire (SDQ): will be used to identify behavioral and&#xD;
           emotional problems of the children based on mother's report. It is a widely and&#xD;
           internationally used brief behavioral screening instrument assessing child positive and&#xD;
           negative attributes across 5 sub-scales: 1) Emotional Symptoms, 2) Conduct Problems, 3)&#xD;
           Hyperactivity-Inattention, 4) Peer Problems, 5) Pro social Behavior. The SDQ has been&#xD;
           extensively researched with various populations and has been translated into over 40&#xD;
           languages. Reliability was generally satisfactory when assessed by internal consistency:&#xD;
           (mean Cronbach α: 0.73), cross-informant correlation (mean: 0.34), or retest stability&#xD;
           after 4 to 6 months (mean: 0.62) . Our team used it in several studies in Bangladesh and&#xD;
           showed meaningful correlation of the sub-scales with socio-economic variables. We used&#xD;
           the parent's report of SDQ and it showed good face validity and a conceptually&#xD;
           meaningful pattern of cross-scale correlations and the acceptable internal reliability&#xD;
           estimates found for each subscale. At five years of age it picked up intervention effect&#xD;
           of prenatal supplementation in our recent analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Memory sub tests of NEuro PSYchological (NEPSY) Assessment: is a comprehensive&#xD;
           instrument designed to assess neuro psychological development and provide insights&#xD;
           regarding academic, social, and behavioral difficulties in preschool and school-age&#xD;
           children. We will use only the memory test of NEPSY. We have used this memory test in&#xD;
           one of our recent rural study on school children. Although it has been used in&#xD;
           Bangladesh earlier but we will pilot it on current population to modify and adapt it&#xD;
           accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Digit span: Digit span forward and backward will be used to measure memory and executive&#xD;
           function of the children. It has been used as a part of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for&#xD;
           Children (WISC-IV) on 10 years old children and currently being used in one study on&#xD;
           rural population. It showed good face validity and test retest reliability after 7 days.&#xD;
           We will also pilot it on our current study area on non-study children to modify and&#xD;
           adapt it accordingly before use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HOME: the middle childhood version of home observation for measurement of environment&#xD;
           will be used to assess quality of home stimulation. Overall inter-observer reliability&#xD;
           for the middle childhood -HOME reported to be satisfactory. Percentage agreement for&#xD;
           specific items in the EC-HOME ranged from 79-100% while Cohen's kappa values ranged from&#xD;
           0.45 to 1. Intraclass correlation for subscale scores were in the interval of 0.79 to&#xD;
           0.94. The intraclass correlation for the total scale was 0.92. It has been used in&#xD;
           several studies of Bangladesh and showed moderately high concurrent validity with IQ&#xD;
           measures (r&gt; 0.5).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fine motor skills using the Purdue peg board or Movement Assessment Battery for&#xD;
           Children- 2 (age -band 2 for 7-10 years): it was prefered to conduct MABC-2, but we will&#xD;
           make decision after piloting both the tests. Correlations between MABC-2 test components&#xD;
           ranged between 0.25 and 0.36 (indicating little overlap between subtests). Correlation&#xD;
           scores range from 0.73 to 0.84 for component scores and are equal to 0.80 for total test&#xD;
           score. The study conducted earlier by us MABC in Bangladesh in younger children and&#xD;
           MABC-2 in 8-year old children. This time a pilot study will be done on our current study&#xD;
           area on non-study children to modify and adapt it accordingly before use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Socio economic status (SES) will be measured using a standard questionnaire.&#xD;
           Anthropometric measurement: Children's height, weight and had circumference will be&#xD;
           measured using standard measures.All these measures were culturally adapted in&#xD;
           Bangladesh and have been used previously by our group. All the instruments are ready to&#xD;
           use but will be pre-tested in the community before using.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliabilities Inter-observer reliabilities will be assessed on all measurements before the&#xD;
      study begins and during the study on 10% of all the measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size In the original study the sample size was calculated as 212 children in each of&#xD;
      the IDA and NANI group considering 5% level of significance, 80% power, an improvement of 0.5&#xD;
      SD in children's development, an ICC of 0.01, design effect of 1.5 and 25% drop outs. In the&#xD;
      follow-up we will assess all the available children of those groups. In the original study&#xD;
      the analysis showed that there was no effect of clustering. Therefore we do not need to&#xD;
      account for the design effect and the sample size without design effect will be 64 in each&#xD;
      group. Considering a drop out of 10%, we need to enrol 70 children in each group and we&#xD;
      believe it is possible to track that many children in those villages to have sufficient power&#xD;
      to conduct the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis After coding, the data will be entered in to a personal computer using SPSS&#xD;
      11.5 software. We will the check for normality of the data. Log transformation will be done&#xD;
      if any data is positively skewed. The characteristics of the tested and lost groups will be&#xD;
      compared using 'student t test' or ANOVA for continuous variables and χ2 for categorical&#xD;
      variables. Pearson's bivariate correlation will be conducted to explore associations between&#xD;
      the age of the child and each developmental measure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sociodemographic characteristics and growth measures at baseline will be compared between&#xD;
      the IDA and NANI groups as well as between the stimulated and unstimulated groups by using&#xD;
      random effects ANOVA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, it will be fitted random-effects multilevel regression model to the intelligence&#xD;
      scores and nutritional outcome scores by using intention-to-treat analyses. We will&#xD;
      investigate the effects of the IDA/NANI groups and stimulated/ unstimulated groups and their&#xD;
      interaction. In each regression analysis, the outcome will be final developmental score, and&#xD;
      we will adjust for the relevant initial score, along with the selected covariates that are&#xD;
      identified as con-founders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Safety Monitoring Plan (DSMP) Study questionnaires will be recorded on paper forms,&#xD;
      which will be kept in a secure facility under the responsibility of the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator of this study. All questionnaires and data forms will be reviewed for&#xD;
      inconsistencies and missing data points. Edited data will be entered in a personal computer&#xD;
      using SPSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical Assurance for Protection of Human rights&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approval of the Research and Ethical Review Committees of icddr,b will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent of one of the parents will be obtained after thorough explanation of&#xD;
      the purpose of the study, requirements of participation, study procedures, and the risks and&#xD;
      benefits to the child. Another person will be acting as witness at the time of consent&#xD;
      signing.&#xD;
&#xD;
