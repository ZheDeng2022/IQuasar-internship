  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, cross-over, randomized, controlled, partly blinded study evaluating&#xD;
      safety and performance of noble metal alloy urinary Catheters (BIP Foley, Bactiguard AB) of&#xD;
      both latex and silicone. The included patients are permanently catheterized spinal cord&#xD;
      injured patients at the Spinalis clinic at Rehab station in Stockholm, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of long term suprapubic use of BIP Foley&#xD;
      catheters, compared to the use of standard catheters for the same time period, on re-current&#xD;
      symptomatic catheter associated urinary tract infection (CAUTIs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • to evaluate safety/performance of the catheter, i.e. antibiotic use, bacteriuria,&#xD;
      bacteremia, urosepsis and ICU stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • assessment of levels of immunological markers in urine, urinary bacterial type and&#xD;
      resistance pattern, catheter comfort, stability of the coating, and bacterial biofilm on the&#xD;
      catheter surface after use.&#xD;
