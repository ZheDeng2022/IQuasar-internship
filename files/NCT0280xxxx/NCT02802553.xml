  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to test and characterize the ability of the Smart Goggles system to&#xD;
      detect fluorescently labeled sentinel lymph nodes (SLNs). Specifically, this study will test&#xD;
      the sensitivity and specificity of the Smart Goggles to detect indocyanine green (ICG)&#xD;
      accumulation in sentinel lymph nodes of breast cancer patients after peritumoral injection of&#xD;
      ICG (Cardio-GreenTM), under standard-of-care application conditions.&#xD;

      Primary Objective -Positive fluorescence signal in SLNs imaged by the Smart Goggles system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Confirmation of ICG within lesions per histologic tissue exam by SLN biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of lesions detected by the Smart Goggles vs. lesions detected using&#xD;
           SPY/Quest/PDE vs. gold standard of gamma probe and blue dyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Collection of preliminary data for a future, powered study for lymphatic mapping in breast&#xD;
      cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design This is an unpowered pilot study to determine the sensitivity of the new Smart&#xD;
      Goggles device, for detection of ICG fluorescence in SLNs of breast cancers in a clinical&#xD;
      setting. The investigators have chosen to examine ICG as the contrast agent and breast cancer&#xD;
      as the clinical target, because this agent is FDA-approved and is regularly used for&#xD;
      lymphatic mapping (skin cancers). The study team will be applying ICG for the same length of&#xD;
      time as the standard-of-care procedures including radiotracers and blue dyes. The study&#xD;
      involves a single visit, lasting ~3-4 hours total. Multiple SLN biopsies will be performed if&#xD;
      multiple SLNs are identified.&#xD;

    <description>Agreement on 6 consecutive participants would occur less than 2% of the time by random chance (p = 0.56 = 0.016). If the two methods agree on all 6 participants, the current protocol will end successfully. However, if the two methods fail to agree on the SLN once among the first 6 participants, enrollment will continue to 25 participants or until a second failed agreement occurs.</description>

    <description>A commercial imaging system that measures fluorescence output of ICG will be used to measure the near infrared fluorescence in vivo. Measurements are painless and involve no risk to the participant. The measurements are non-contact and recorded by a computer; each measurement is painless and takes 10 seconds. The signal is calibrated against known fluorescence standards, and the relative amount of ICG in a given measurement is interpolated from the standard curve.</description>

    <description>Smart Goggle is a novel stereoscopic wearable multimodal intraoperative imaging and display systems entitled Integrated Imaging Goggles for assessment of SLNs. The prototype system offers real time stereoscopic fluorescence imaging along with in vivo handheld microscopy. The investigators have found that the system can detect fluorescent targets with as low as 1.2 picomoles ICG (60 nM concentration). The hand-held microscopy module has a resolution of 25 micron. The prototype system has 2 complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) imaging sensors housed on a printed circuit board (PCB) with imaging lenses and emission filters optimized for ICG dye. The light source provides concurrent excitation centered at 780 nm and white light illumination with OD6 level cut-off. The Smart Goggles is a non-invasive imaging system that does not require contact with patients.</description>
