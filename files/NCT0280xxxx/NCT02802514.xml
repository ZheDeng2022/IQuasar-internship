  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The drug effects will be studied after a single dose of 50 milligram (mg) albiglutide and a&#xD;
      single dose of 10 microgram exenatide, to gain insight into the central mechanisms of nausea&#xD;
      associated with Glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R) agonists. This study will explore&#xD;
      the potential differences at the expected time of maximum concentration (Cmax) between a&#xD;
      long-acting (albiglutide) and short-acting (exenatide) GLP-1R agonist in brain activation of&#xD;
      healthy volunteers assessed by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). This is a phase IV, 2-part,&#xD;
      2-period crossover (session), single dose, randomized, single blind (blinded to both the&#xD;
      subject and the imaging evaluators analysing the MRI data), placebo- and active-controlled&#xD;
      study in adult healthy volunteers who are susceptible to motion sickness. Part A and Part B&#xD;
      are the same in design, both consisting of a screening stage, a dosing/assessment stage, and&#xD;
      a follow-up visit. Data from Part A will inform progression, methods, and analysis plan for&#xD;
      Part B. Each sequence includes three scanning visits: albiglutide plus scan, exenatide plus&#xD;
      scan and an off-therapy -natural history scan with a 6-9 week washout period between the&#xD;
      dosing scans. A total of 24 to 28 subjects will be randomized in the study (Part A and Part&#xD;
      B). The cross over design is divided into 2 sessions and schedule is as follow, on Day 1&#xD;
      (either Session 1 (S1) or Session 2 (S2) per, if randomized) subject will under go an&#xD;
      off-therapy MRI scan, on Day 5 subject will receive a single dose of 50 mg albiglutide or&#xD;
      albiglutide placebo, and Day 8 subject will receive a single dose of 10 microgram exenatide&#xD;
      or saline placebo followed by a post-dose MRI scan. At each session subject will receive only&#xD;
      one active drug (albiglutide or exenatide).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Up to Week 11</time_frame>
    <description>BOLD signal fMRI Visual Nauseogenic Task data were to be collected at indicated time-points. The seed-to-voxel driven approach included a priori seed Regions of interest (ROIs) placed in brain areas subserving nausea-related processing included regions like interoceptive/sensory (insula, Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC]), emotional/affective (amygdala, Pregenual anterior cingulate cortex [pgACC]), and cognitive/evaluative (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC]/ Occipitofrontal Circumference [OFC]) brain areas, primary visual (V1) and extrastriate cortices. The primary endpoints of this exploratory study involved combining data from Part A and Part B. The purpose of Part A was decision making for Part B. Placebo was used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, while preserving single-blind (similar to double dummy), hence data was to be reported in albiglutide, exenatide and off-therapy arms only.</description>

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>This crossover study conducted in adult healthy volunteers who were susceptible to motion sickness to explore regional brain activity and connectivity associated with treatment using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Participants were randomized to receive single dose of 50milligram (mg) albiglutide and 10microgram (µg) exenatide along with placebo</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>A total of 10 participants were screened, of which 6 were screen-failures and 4 were randomized. Participants from United States site were part of the study. This was a 2-part study; however, study was terminated early due to portfolio strategic reason and only Part A was completed.</pre_assignment_details>

          <description>Participants underwent off-therapy MRI on Day 1 then received albiglutide 50 mg on Day 5 followed by exenatide matching placebo on Day 8 during Session 1. Post-dose MRI was conducted following exenatide placebo on Day 8 in session 1. There was a wash-out period of 6-9 weeks between the two sessions. In Session 2 participants received albiglutide matching placebo on Day 1 followed by 10 µg of exenatide on Day 4. Post-dose MRI was conducted following exenatide dose on Day 4 in session 2. Placebo was used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, while preserving single-blind. Hence, post-exenatide placebo MRI served as the post-albiglutide MRI in this study, to preserve the study blinding and to allow albiglutide sufficient time to reach Tmax.</description>

        <description>BOLD signal fMRI Visual Nauseogenic Task data were to be collected at indicated time-points. The seed-to-voxel driven approach included a priori seed Regions of interest (ROIs) placed in brain areas subserving nausea-related processing included regions like interoceptive/sensory (insula, Dorsal anterior cingulate cortex [dACC]), emotional/affective (amygdala, Pregenual anterior cingulate cortex [pgACC]), and cognitive/evaluative (dorsolateral prefrontal cortex [dlPFC]/ Occipitofrontal Circumference [OFC]) brain areas, primary visual (V1) and extrastriate cortices. The primary endpoints of this exploratory study involved combining data from Part A and Part B. The purpose of Part A was decision making for Part B. Placebo was used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, while preserving single-blind (similar to double dummy), hence data was to be reported in albiglutide, exenatide and off-therapy arms only.</description>

          <description>GABA concentrations was planned to be analyzed using proton-density weighted 1H-MRS. 1H-MRS analysis assessed regional differences GABA concentrations, normalized as a ratio with creatine. MRS quantification of metabolites of interest were based on frequency domain analysis using a LC Model. CRLBs, as reported from the LC Model analysis, were planned to be used to assess the reliability of the major metabolites and adequate SNR. CRLBs values less than 40% were further planned to be analyzed. Metabolite maps for each participant, and each session were planned to be calculated. Placebo was used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, while preserving single-blind (similar to double dummy), hence data was reported in albiglutide, exenatide and off-therapy arms only.</description>

        <description>Data of participants with abnormal heart rate (measured during site visits by sphygmomanometer) were reported. Participants with low and high heart rate has been presented. Potential clinical concern value for heart rate is &lt; 50 beats per minute to &gt; 120 beats per minute.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1: pre-MRI, 0.5 hour post-MRI; Day 4: -2 hours pre-MRI, 0.5 and 1 hour post MRI; Day 5; Day 8: -2 hour pre-MRI, 0.5 and 1 hour post-MRI</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population. Only participants present at specific time points were analyzed. Placebo was planned to be used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, for preserving single-blind (like double dummy), hence data was reported in albiglutide, exenatide and off-therapy arms only</population>

            <title>Albiglutide 50 mg</title>
            <description>Participants received albiglutide 50 mg on Day 5 and exenatide placebo on Day 8 or albiglutide 50 mg on Day 1 and exenatide placebo on Day 4 during session 1 or 2 as per randomization. The timing of the albiglutide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of albiglutide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post-albiglutide dose MRI in this study and the exenatide placebo served to preserve the study blinding.</description>

The timing of the exenatide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of exentatide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post exenatide dose MRI and the albiglutide matching placebo served to preserve the study blind.</description>

        <description>SBP and DBP were measured in supine position after 5 minutes rest. Data for Session 1 and 2 and for Pre and Post MRI has been presented. Potential clinical concern value for SBP is &lt;100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and &gt;170 mmHg. Potential clinical concern value for DBP is &lt;50 mmHg and &gt;110 mmHg.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1: pre-MRI, 0.5 hour post-MRI; Day 4: -2 hours pre-MRI, 0.5 and 1 hour post MRI; Day 5; Day 8: 0.5 and 1 hour post-MRI</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population. Only participants present at specific time points were analyzed. Placebo was planned to be used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, for preserving single-blind (like double dummy), hence data was reported in albiglutide, exenatide and off-therapy arms only</population>

            <title>Albiglutide 50 mg</title>
            <description>Participants received albiglutide 50 mg on Day 5 and exenatide placebo on Day 8 or albiglutide 50 mg on Day 1 and exenatide placebo on Day 4 during session 1 or 2 as per randomization. The timing of the albiglutide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of albiglutide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post-albiglutide dose MRI in this study and the exenatide placebo served to preserve the study blinding.</description>

The timing of the exenatide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of exentatide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post exenatide dose MRI and the albiglutide matching placebo served to preserve the study blind.</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Abnormal SBP and DBP for Session 2</title>
        <description>SBP and DBP were measured in supine position after 5 minutes rest. Data for Session 1 and 2 and for Pre and Post MRI has been presented. Potential clinical concern value for SBP is &lt;100 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) and &gt;170 mmHg. Potential clinical concern value for DBP is &lt;50 mmHg and &gt;110 mmHg.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1: pre-MRI, 0.5 hour post-MRI; Day 4: -2 hours pre-MRI, 0.5 and 1 hour post MRI; Day 5; Day 8: 0.5 and 1 hour post-MRI</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population. Only participants present at specific time points were analyzed. Placebo was planned to be used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, for preserving single-blind (like double dummy), hence data was reported in albiglutide, exenatide and off-therapy arms only</population>

            <title>Albiglutide 50 mg</title>
            <description>Participants received albiglutide 50 mg on Day 5 and exenatide placebo on Day 8 or albiglutide 50 mg on Day 1 and exenatide placebo on Day 4 during session 1 or 2 as per randomization. The timing of the albiglutide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of albiglutide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post-albiglutide dose MRI in this study and the exenatide placebo served to preserve the study blinding.</description>

The timing of the exenatide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of exentatide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post exenatide dose MRI and the albiglutide matching placebo served to preserve the study blind.</description>

        <title>GI VAS for Assessment of Nausea for Session 2</title>
        <description>Participant completed VAS to record their perception of stomach fullness, hunger, nausea, bloating and abdominal pain. The VAS was represented by lines, 100 millimeter in length, anchored with words describing the most negative rating on the left and the most positive rating on the right. Scores ranged from 0 mm to 100 mm. Scores of 0 mm are worst (most negative rating on the left) and scores of 100 mm are best (most positive rating on the right). NA indicates that data were not available as standard deviation could not be calculated due to low number of participants.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 (Pre-MRI and 0.5 hour post-MRI); Day 4 (Pre-MRI and 0.5 hour post-MRI); and Day 8 (Pre-MRI and 0.5 hour post-MRI)</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population. Only participants present at specific time points were analyzed. Placebo was planned to be used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, for preserving single-blind (like double dummy), hence data was reported in albiglutide, exenatide and off-therapy arms only</population>

            <title>Albiglutide 50 mg</title>
            <description>Participants received albiglutide 50 mg on Day 5 and exenatide placebo on Day 8 or albiglutide 50 mg on Day 1 and exenatide placebo on Day 4 during session 1 or 2 as per randomization. The timing of the albiglutide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of albiglutide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post-albiglutide dose MRI in this study and the exenatide placebo served to preserve the study blinding.</description>

The timing of the exenatide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of exentatide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post exenatide dose MRI and the albiglutide matching placebo served to preserve the study blind.</description>

        <title>Motion Sickness Assessment Questionnaire (MSAQ) for Assessment of Nausea for Session 1</title>
        <description>Participant completed MSAQ to quantify the severity of different dimensions of nausea induced by motion sickness. There were total 16 items: 4 related to gastro-intestinal (GI), 5 related to central (C), 3 related to peripheral (P) and 4 related to sopite-related (SR). All items were scored individually on a scale of 1-9 where 1 means 'not at all severe' and 9 means 'severe', with higher score indicates more severity. Individual 16 items with their scores are presented. NA indicates that data were not available as standard deviation could not be calculated due to low number of participants.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 0.5 hour post-MRI; Day 4 0.5 hour post-MRI; and Day 8 0.5 hour post-MRI</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population. Only participants present at specific time points were analyzed. Placebo was planned to be used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, for preserving single-blind (like double dummy), hence data was reported in albiglutide, exenatide and off-therapy arms only</population>

            <title>Albiglutide 50 mg</title>
            <description>Participants received albiglutide 50 mg on Day 5 and exenatide placebo on Day 8 or albiglutide 50 mg on Day 1 and exenatide placebo on Day 4 during session 1 or 2 as per randomization. The timing of the albiglutide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of albiglutide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post-albiglutide dose MRI in this study and the exenatide placebo served to preserve the study blinding.</description>

The timing of the exenatide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of exentatide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post exenatide dose MRI and the albiglutide matching placebo served to preserve the study blind.</description>

        <title>MSAQ for Assessment of Nausea for Session 2</title>
        <description>Participant completed MSAQ to quantify the severity of different dimensions of nausea induced by motion sickness. There were total 16 items: 4 related to gastro-intestinal (GI), 5 related to central (C), 3 related to peripheral (P) and 4 related to sopite-related (SR). All items were scored individually on a scale of 1-9 where 1 means 'not at all severe' and 9 means 'severe', with higher score indicates more severity. Individual 16 items with their scores are presented. NA indicates that data were not available as standard deviation could not be calculated due to low number of participants.</description>
        <time_frame>Day 1 0.5 hour post-MRI; Day 4 0.5 hour post-MRI; and Day 8 0.5 hour post-MRI</time_frame>
        <population>Safety Population. Only participants present at specific time points were analyzed. Placebo was planned to be used to enable albiglutide and exenatide to be dosed at different times relative to MRI due to differences in Tmax, for preserving single-blind (like double dummy), hence data was reported in albiglutide, exenatide and off-therapy arms only</population>

            <title>Albiglutide 50 mg</title>
            <description>Participants received albiglutide 50 mg on Day 5 and exenatide placebo on Day 8 or albiglutide 50 mg on Day 1 and exenatide placebo on Day 4 during session 1 or 2 as per randomization. The timing of the albiglutide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of albiglutide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post-albiglutide dose MRI in this study and the exenatide placebo served to preserve the study blinding.</description>

The timing of the exenatide dose and post-dose MRI were based on the Tmax of exentatide. Hence, the Day 4 and Day 8 post dose MRI served as the post exenatide dose MRI and the albiglutide matching placebo served to preserve the study blind.</description>
