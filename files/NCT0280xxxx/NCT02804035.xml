  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study aims to gain experience with the first clinical use of the to-be&#xD;
      marketed drug-device combination product, the sc2Wear Furosemide Combination Product and to&#xD;
      assess methods and procedures for evaluation of product performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To gain first in man experience of a novel drug-device combination product&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the suitability of the methods and procedures for evaluating of the&#xD;
           performance of the sc2Wear Pump&#xD;

      This study will be an open label, single-dose study to gain experience with first clinical&#xD;
      use and to evaluate the suitability of the methods and procedures for evaluation of product&#xD;
      performance of a to-be-marketed drug-device combination product (sc2WearTM Furosemide&#xD;
      Combination Product) in a minimum of 20 adult male and female subjects previously diagnosed&#xD;
      with mild to advanced heart failure (NYHA class II-IV). The study will enroll up to 30&#xD;
      Subjects to ensure a minimum of 20 evaluable Subjects. Methodology: Each Subject will&#xD;
      complete Screening, Treatment, and Follow-Up Phases on an outpatient basis. During the&#xD;
      Screening Phase, all Subjects who sign the informed consent form and satisfy the&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be enrolled into the trial. Drug administration may start&#xD;
      on the day of enrollment or be scheduled within 3 days of completion of Screening procedures.&#xD;
      However, if the treatment visit doesn't occur within 3 days of initial screening, subjects&#xD;
      may be rescreened and treated within 3 days of rescreening. The Treatment Phase comprises a&#xD;
      preprogrammed bi-phasic 5 hour drug administration. Treatment Day observations will commence&#xD;
      with pre-placement procedures and continue until one hour after device removal. Device&#xD;
      preparation, placement and removal will be performed by study staff in accordance with&#xD;
      product instructions for use. Removal will occur within&#xD;
&#xD;
      3 hours of completion of drug delivery (8 hours of start of administration). Subjects will&#xD;
      return 5-7 days after the Treatment Day for a post treatment follow-up and photography. After&#xD;
      preparation of the skin, the device will be placed on the upper abdominal area by clinical&#xD;
      study staff. Subjects are advised to avoid strenuous physical activity or activities that&#xD;
      could expose the device to moisture such as swimming, bathing or showering. Participants will&#xD;
      be informed that marked diuresis may ensue after activation, and that they should avoid&#xD;
      travel, operating a vehicle or other situations without immediate access to bathroom&#xD;
      facilities. For each Subject, a reusable components (Activator) and a single-use unit&#xD;
      (Cartridge) will be used. Following removal from the skin, the assembled device will be&#xD;
      inspected and photographed by the site staff. The used device (assembled Cartridge and&#xD;
      Activator) will be placed in a sealed container and returned for further inspection and&#xD;
      measurement of residual volume in the device reservoir.&#xD;
