    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the mechanical properties of the tendon after&#xD;
      conservative treated Achilles tendon ruptures with or without early controlled loading. This&#xD;
      is done in a randomized trial and the mechanical properties are measured using roentgen&#xD;
      stereometric analysis (RSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that early weightbearing improves mechanical properties of conservative&#xD;
      treated Achilles tendon ruptures without causing elongation of the tendon.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment of Achilles tendon ruptures includes surgical repair or immobilization in an&#xD;
      orthosis, followed by prolonged rehabilitation. Improved rehabilitation regimens still&#xD;
      display imperfect recovery, with deficits such as persistent end-range muscle weakness,&#xD;
      tendon elongation and incomplete return to pre-injury activity level. The underlying&#xD;
      mechanisms are unknown, but are likely to involve molecular and cellular aspects of the early&#xD;
      healing processes. Animal experiments have shown that short episodes of vigorous loading&#xD;
      during tendon healing create a stronger tendon, and lead to less elongation than continuous&#xD;
      loading. Early controlled training has also been shown to improve the material properties of&#xD;
      surgically repaired tendons. However, more and more clinics now turn away from surgery and&#xD;
      towards conservative treatment, while studies on rehabilitation mainly concern sutured&#xD;
      tendons. It is therefore also important to understand how to best rehabilitate conservatively&#xD;
      treated patients. The aim is to investigate the effect of early controlled loading on&#xD;
      conservatively treated Achilles tendon ruptures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients (age 18-60 years of age) are treated conservatively by receiving a removable&#xD;
      foam walker boot at the emergency department. The patients are thereafter called by the&#xD;
      principal investigator and are asked if they want to participate in the study. Patients who&#xD;
      are interested in participating in the study receive oral and in written information about&#xD;
      the study of the principal investigator of the study (Pernilla Eliasson).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 2 weeks, the rupture is localized by ultrasound and 4 tantalum beads are implanted&#xD;
      percutaneously in the proximal and distal part of the tendon. These beads are used for&#xD;
      measurements of the mechanical properties of the tendon by using RSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are thereafter randomized to early controlled loading or control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients wear the foam walker boot for 7 weeks. Full weight-bearing is allowed as&#xD;
      tolerated from the beginning. Both groups perform motion exercises outside the boot with 20&#xD;
      repetitions, 3 times per day as of 14 days after rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients in the early loading group are provided with a special training pedal where&#xD;
      pedal resistance can be increased during the treatment period. The patients will use this&#xD;
      pedal twice a day starting 2 weeks after rupture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the initial 7 weeks, the patients are referred to physical therapists uninvolved in&#xD;
      this research, but with the instruction to follow the regional rehabilitation guidelines for&#xD;
      Achilles tendon ruptures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanical properties of the tendon will be estimated by measuring tendon length,&#xD;
      cross-sectional area (CSA) and stiffness at week 7, 19 and 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The elastic modulus of the tendon at 19 weeks it the primary variable of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At week 7, both the elastic and plastic deformation will be measured. Tendon CSA will be&#xD;
      evaluated using computer tomography (CT). Tendon elongation will be evaluated by RSA at week&#xD;
      2, 7, 19 and 52. Calf muscle circumference, passive and active range of motion in the ankle&#xD;
      joint and a heel-raise test will be performed at week 19 and 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall function will be assessed by the Achilles Tendon Rupture Score at 19 and 52&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications and re-ruptures will be registered.&#xD;
