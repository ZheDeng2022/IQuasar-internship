    <description>The WallFlex™ Pancreatic RX Fully Covered Soft Stent System consists of a flexible delivery system preloaded with a self-expanding pancreatic metal stent. Patients who meet all eligibility criteria will receive the WallFlex Pancreatic stent for up to 6 months stent indwell and 6 months follow-up after stent removal. A patient is considered &quot;enrolled&quot; after signing the study-specific Informed Consent Form (ICF). Patients who sign the ICF but subsequently do not meet one or more of the selection criteria will be considered screen failures and excluded from the study.</description>
