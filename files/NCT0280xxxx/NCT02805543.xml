      Objective: The main target of this study was to research the early changes of retrobulbar and&#xD;
      intrarenal hemodynamics, then to research the correlation between them in type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      (T2DM) patients without diabetic kidney disease (DKD) and diabetic retinopathy (DR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: 35 T2DM patients (diabetes group) without vascular complications and 30 healthy&#xD;
      people (control group) were recruited to research the early changes of renal function,&#xD;
      retrobulbar and intrarenal hemodynamics, and then to research the correlation between them.&#xD;
      The primary endpoints were the intrarenal hemodynamic (bilateral kidney RI) in bilateral&#xD;
      interlobular renal arteries were evaluated using Doppler Sonographic; the secondary endpoints&#xD;
      were the retrobulbar hemodynamics RI in the bilateral central retinal artery (CRA), posterior&#xD;
      ciliary artery (PCA), and arteria ophthalmica (OA) were evaluated using color doppler imaging&#xD;
      (CDI); the tertiary endpoints were the biochemical endpoints: blood-fat (TC, HDL-C, LDL-C,&#xD;
      and TG), FPG, 2hPG, HbA1c, and renal function parameters (BUN, Cr, and GFR); in addition, the&#xD;
      albumin excrete rate (AER), urinary albumin/creatinine ratio (UACR) were measured.&#xD;

        The investigators selected 45 T2DM patients (25 males, 20 females) without microangiopathy&#xD;
        (DR and DKD) as diabetes group and 38 healthy people (21 males, 17 females) as control&#xD;
        group from the diabetic outpatient clinic in Shenyang the Fourth Hospital of People, but&#xD;
        only 34 patients (19 males, 15 females) in the diabetes group and 32 healthy people (17&#xD;
        males, 15 females) can be researched in our study, all the participants were the Chinese&#xD;
        Hans. All patients were provided a diet and exercise program by professional nutritionists.&#xD;
