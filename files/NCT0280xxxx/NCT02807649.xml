    <textblock>
      To evaluate the efficacy of Nutrilite® ginkgo biloba cistanche tablets in relieving the&#xD;
      symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome(CFS), the investigators randomly recruit189 subjects&#xD;
      with CFS, aged 35-60 yrs. The relief of fatigue and improvement of sexual function are&#xD;
      evaluated by World Health Organization Quality Of Life Brief (WHOQoL-Bref), Sexual Life&#xD;
      Quality Questionnaire (SLQQ), chronic fatigue syndrome, symptoms of self-assessment at the&#xD;
      baseline and the end of intervention. Subjects also underwent a blood test measuring the&#xD;
      concentration of biochemical indicators. Cistanche is mainly used to strengthen the renal&#xD;
      function, nourish essence and blood in the treatment of lumbar debility, impotence,&#xD;
      infertility and muscles weakness, constipation. etc. The study is to test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      consecutive 60-day intake of the study tablets can relieve the symptoms of CFS; according to&#xD;
      the change of blood biology indicators, the investigators will also evaluate the association&#xD;
      between the change of plasma outcome measures and chronic fatigue syndrome.&#xD;

      Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is the common name for a group of significantly debilitating&#xD;
      medical conditions characterized by persistent fatigue and other specific symptoms that lasts&#xD;
      for a minimum of six months in adults. Symptoms of CFS include malaise after exertion;&#xD;
      unrefreshing sleep, physical exhaustion, sore throat, headaches, widespread muscle and joint&#xD;
      pain, and depression. The cause of CFS is unclear, but appears to result from a multiple&#xD;
      factors. Generally, the onset of CFS is associated with psychological stress, endocrine and&#xD;
      immune disorder, genetic factors, and viral infections the diagnostic criteria for CFS&#xD;
      modified by Fukuda,etc.in 1994. Currently, there is no one common treatment for CFS.&#xD;
      regularly used treatments include the medications which enhance immunity system and&#xD;
      nutrition-balanced therapy, Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), , local physiotherapy, , and&#xD;
      graded exercise therapy(GET).The main purposes of the treatments are to relieve CFS symptoms,&#xD;
      improve the psychological condition and social function. According to the U.S. Centers for&#xD;
      Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) , CFS will become one of the main diseases that affect&#xD;
      human health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cistanche, is a desert plants in the family Orobanchaceae. It mainly grows in the sandy&#xD;
      pastures of Inner Mongolia, Gansu and Xinjiang Province of China. The plants of the best&#xD;
      quality is from Inner Mongolia. According to Traditional Chinese Medical theories, its nature&#xD;
      and flavour is sweet, salty, warm, and goes into kidney, large intestine meridians. It is&#xD;
      commonly used to invigorate the renal function, nourish essence and blood in the treatment of&#xD;
      lumbar debility, impotence, infertility and muscles weakness, and regulates the intestinal&#xD;
      tract environment such as dryness, and constipation. A clinical trial showed that Cistanche&#xD;
      granules relieved kidney deficiency symptoms in 86.7% of the chronic fatigue syndrome&#xD;
      patients, demonstrated a significant difference comparing post-intervention to baseline (P&#xD;
      &lt;0.01).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ginko As recorded in the Yuan Herbal Classic by Lulu Zhang Feng in Qing Dynasty, ginkgo has&#xD;
      functions of reducing phlegm, detoxification, insect killing, could cure scabies and gangrene&#xD;
      tumors, acute mastitis ulceration disease, dental caries, infantile diarrhea, leukorrhea with&#xD;
      reddish discharge, chronic stranguria with turbid discharge, emission enuresis disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, ginkgo can inhibit various types of pathogenic bacteria. A clinical study&#xD;
      (conducted by Wuhan Military General Hospital) of over 100 subjects with high cholesterol&#xD;
      showed that ginkgo extract (guanxin ketones) has antihypertensive effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Germany, United Kingdom, France, USA and South Korea also used ginkgo leaves to produce drugs&#xD;
      for treating cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ginkgo root, containing ginkgo lactone C, M, A, B, is sweet, warm, plain and nontoxic, and&#xD;
      can be used to treat leucorrhea disease and emission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study about late Alzheimer disease found that ginkgo can improve vascular patency, thus has&#xD;
      notable effect in anti-aging of brain function in elderly people, and enhancing memories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with ginkgo juice supplement showed significant improvement in memory, attention and&#xD;
      complex movements compared to the control group, patients who take ginkgo juice have&#xD;
      significantly improved.&#xD;
