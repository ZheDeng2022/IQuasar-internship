  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators propose a one-year, repeated measures, within-subject design to examine the&#xD;
      impact of improved caregiver depression on child asthma outcomes. A cross-lagged panel&#xD;
      modeling (CLPM) for longitudinal data will be fit using a maximum likelihood structural&#xD;
      equation model (SEM) in order to explore longitudinal mediation between asthma outcomes&#xD;
      (asthma control, spirometry, quality of life (QOL)) and depressive symptoms. CLPM will test&#xD;
      whether caregiver improvement preceded child asthma improvement, and SEM will test whether&#xD;
      improved adherence and/or decreased child anxiety/depression mediated the effect. The&#xD;
      investigators considered a randomized control trial, but it would not be ethically acceptable&#xD;
      to withhold medication from caregivers diagnosed with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) for the&#xD;
      proposed one-year duration of the study. It is unlikely that potential participants in the&#xD;
      study would find this acceptable. Furthermore a controlled design is not necessary since the&#xD;
      investigators are not testing the efficacy of antidepressants for depression, but rather the&#xD;
      impact of improvement on caregiver depression on the child.&#xD;

      Caregiver will be consented for his/her and the child's participation. The child will assent&#xD;
      to participate before study procedures begin. The proposed study will last 52 weeks and&#xD;
      consist of study visits every 4 weeks (14 visits total).&#xD;

    <description>This is a 52 week non-placebo controlled and non-randomized clinical research study to see whether treating Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) in caregivers of children with asthma will improve asthma outcomes in children. Caregivers may choose to receive an antidepressant medication that is considered standard medical care for MDD, or may opt out of antidepressant treatment. No treatment is withheld from participants and no placebos are used, thus there is no active intervention in this study.</description>
