  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is a major risk factor for mobility problems in older adults and many older adults&#xD;
      use a walking aid to help with their mobility. The use of a walking aid changes normal&#xD;
      walking patterns and makes walking harder, leading people to have more functional problems.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test the effects of 12 months of a multi-modal balance&#xD;
      intervention (MMBI) with supervised weight loss compared to MMBI only on fitness, functional&#xD;
      performance, balance, and economy of gait. Participants will be one of 120 participants in&#xD;
      the VAMHCS. Participation in this study is voluntary. The research will be conducted at the&#xD;
      VAMHCS. The entire study will take approximately 4 years to complete. Subjects' participation&#xD;
      in the study will last 24 months.&#xD;

      Note: new recruitment on hold due to COVID-19&#xD;
&#xD;
      Older obese adults suffer disproportionately from walking mobility limitations. Sedentary,&#xD;
      obese older adults are at an increased risk for having or developing difficulties with&#xD;
      mobility. These individuals are often excluded from studies due to their advanced mobility&#xD;
      limitations. A number of studies have compared the effects of weight loss alone, exercise&#xD;
      alone, or weight loss in combination with exercise on functional performance in older adults,&#xD;
      but none of the studies have specifically targeted subjects who use walking assistive&#xD;
      devices. The purpose of this study is to test the effects of a 12 month multi-modal exercise&#xD;
      rehabilitation intervention with a nutrition program versus a nutrition program only on&#xD;
      fitness, functional performance, mobility, and muscle mass. The results of this study will&#xD;
      lead to new and more effective interventions that could reduce disability, fall risk,&#xD;
      injury-related hospitalization and death in older Veterans.&#xD;
