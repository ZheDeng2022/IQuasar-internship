  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asthma affects about 10% of children and 6% of adults in industrialized countries.&#xD;
      Lymphocytes (L) Th2, a T cell population (LT) producing interleukin (IL) -4, 5 and 13 are&#xD;
      broadly involved in this pathology in experimental models and in humans. Many studies show&#xD;
      that the signaling pathways activated by the commitment of T receiver differ depending LT.&#xD;
      The identification of specific signaling pathways links to Th2 offer new therapeutic&#xD;
      approaches. Precedent study showed that mouse Th2 selectively expressed related to calcium&#xD;
      channels sensitive channels Cav1 voltage, normally found in excitable cells where they are&#xD;
      defined as receivers dihydropyridine (DHP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the present study is to show the presence of Cav1 channels in inflammatory cells&#xD;
      in allergic asthmatics and show overexpression of these channels in the peripheral blood&#xD;
      mononuclear cells from asthmatic subjects before and / or after stimulation with the TCR in&#xD;
      comparison with controls.&#xD;
