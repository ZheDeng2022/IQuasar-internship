      Study Design: A Phase 4, single arm, efficacy and safety study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase: Phase IV&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Sites: 1 (one)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 70 healthy subjects of both genders. (This study is designed as a Phase 4&#xD;
      study aiming to obtain efficacy and safety data from the study group. Estimation of Sample&#xD;
      Size and Power for Comparing Two Means with standard deviation for each primary endpoint was&#xD;
      performed for determination of the study population. 70 healthy subjects were estimated to be&#xD;
      sufficient for obtaining efficacy and safety data from the study group.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug: Imuneks 10 mg Capsules, containing 10 mg micronized Beta-1,3/1,6-D-glucan derived&#xD;
      from baker's yeast of which at least 80 % is below 10 microns (İMUNEKS FARMA İlaç Sanayi ve&#xD;
      Ticaret A.Ş., Turkey)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Subjects will receive two capsules of the study drug every morning approximately&#xD;
      two hours after breakfast&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients Registry: Study staff will maintain appropriate medical and research records for&#xD;
      this study, in compliance with ICH E6 and regulatory and institutional requirements for the&#xD;
      protection of confidentiality of subjects. Study staff will permit authorized representatives&#xD;
      of regulatory agencies to examine (and when required by applicable law, to copy) research&#xD;
      records for the purposes of quality assurance reviews, audits, and evaluation of the study&#xD;
      safety, progress and data validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from screening and data collected during the study will be recorded in the&#xD;
      subject's Case Report Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MedDRA Data dictionary will be used for adverse event determination and normal laboratory&#xD;
      ranges will be added to the ITF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized CRFs will be used to document the subjects' data during the course of the study.&#xD;
      The investigator will assure that all data are entered promptly, legibly, completely,&#xD;
      accurately and in accordance with source documents. This also applies to the data for those&#xD;
      subjects who -after having consented to participate -underwent baseline examinations required&#xD;
      especially for inclusion into the study but who - because a criterion for exclusion was met&#xD;
      or for other reasons - were not included into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor will require the top (original) copy of the CRF but the Investigator will also be&#xD;
      left with a copy for his trial file.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each page of the CRF must be signed by the (co-)Investigator. A stamp as signature is not&#xD;
      allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any corrections to the case report forms must be carried out by the investigator or his&#xD;
      designate. A single line must be drawn through the original entry, making sure the previous&#xD;
      data are not totally obliterated. The reason for the correction has to be given and it has to&#xD;
      be dated and initialled. Incorrect entries must not be covered with correcting fluid, or&#xD;
      obliterated, or made illegible in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Even if there are no changes from a previous examination, in the interests of completeness of&#xD;
      data acquisition, the questions which are repeated in each section of the case report forms&#xD;
      should be answered in full text. A reasonable explanation must be given by the investigator&#xD;
      for all missing data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The case report forms will be completed immediately after termination of the individual&#xD;
      treatment and observation periods and the final examination. After being signed by the&#xD;
      Principal Investigator, they will be sent to QC department for data verification. Thereafter,&#xD;
      CRFs will corrected, if applicable. CRFs cannot be sent by post but only be personally&#xD;
      submitted to the monitor during a visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All medical records upon which the case report forms are based must be kept for at least 5&#xD;
      years after completion of the study. At this time it will be discussed with the Sponsor&#xD;
      whether or not storage is required for a longer period. It is the responsibility of the&#xD;
      investigator to assure that the study is conducted in accordance with the protocol and that&#xD;
      valid data are entered into the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and auditing of this study will be conducted in accordance with SOPs&#xD;
      (IDEAL-BE-S08-1, IDEAL-BE-S08-2 and IDEAL-BE-S08-3) developed by IDEAL in order to check the&#xD;
      adherence to the protocol in compliance with Good Clinical Practice guidelines and to ensure&#xD;
      international acceptability of the study data. In support of these measures, the investigator&#xD;
      will make the records available to ALPAN, IDEAL or to the Sponsor upon request at reasonable&#xD;
      times. Case report forms will be checked for completeness and clarity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data verification is legally required and will be done by direct comparison with source&#xD;
      documents in case of subject's respective consent or by cross-checking with source documents&#xD;
      in the presence of the investigator - always giving due consideration to data protection and&#xD;
      medical confidentiality. In this respect the investigator assures ALPAN and IDEAL of support&#xD;
      at all times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will permit a representative of ALPAN, IDEAL or the Sponsor to monitor the&#xD;
      study as frequently as necessary to determine that data recording and protocol adherence are&#xD;
      satisfactory. The CRFs and related documents will be reviewed in detail in accordance with&#xD;
      the SOPs of IDEAL(IDEAL-BE-S08-1, IDEAL-BE-S08-2 and IDEAL-BE-S08-3) and Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits may be conducted also by a representative of ALPAN, IDEAL or the Sponsor at suitable&#xD;
      intervals throughout the study. These visits will be for the purpose of verifying adherence&#xD;
      to the protocol and the completeness and exactness of the data entered on the Case Report&#xD;
      Forms. The Sponsor is allowed to get any information about the state of the study. Case&#xD;
      Report Forms will be transported from the investigator via IDEAL to the Sponsor after&#xD;
      completion of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fulfilment of their obligation to the Sponsor to verify compliance with the protocol,&#xD;
      ALPAN and IDEAL will require that the investigator permits their monitors to review those&#xD;
      portions of the subject's primary medical records which directly concern this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is the investigator's obligation to assure documentation of all relevant data in the&#xD;
      subject's file, such as medical history / concomitant diseases, date of study enrolment,&#xD;
      visit dates, results of examinations, administrations of medication and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will affirm and uphold the principle of the subject's right for protection&#xD;
      against the invasion of privacy. Throughout the study, all data will only be identified by&#xD;
      volunteer number. The data will be blinded correspondingly in all data analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to guarantee that the performance of the study is in accordance with the GCP&#xD;
      provisions, in-house and, if needed, on-site audits may be carried out. The auditor will be&#xD;
      independent from the staff involved in the proceedings of this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator agrees to give the auditor access to all relevant documents for review. The&#xD;
      same applies in case of an inspection of local or national authorities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After every on-site audit the investigator will receive an audit confirmation by the auditor.&#xD;
      This has to be filed together with the study documentation and be made available to the local&#xD;
      authorities in case of supervision. At the end of the study, an audit certificate will be&#xD;
      included in the final report.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Monitoring: Adverse event questioning and examination will be done at every visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference from baseline of Imuneks 10 mg Capsules on the immunological examinations&#xD;
           (lymphocytes, macrophages, neutrophils, eosinophils and monocytes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of subjects with no symptoms of cold(colds seen in the first week will be&#xD;
           excluded from the evaluations as prophylactic effect will not be assessable before this&#xD;
           period)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Number of Subjects Reporting Side Effects and number of subjects who took rest periods&#xD;
      during the treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plan for missing data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who prematurely withdraw from treatment or from the trial will not be replaced.&#xD;
      Missing values for all efficacy parameters will not be included to the evaluation. Missing&#xD;
      values will be treated using a list wise deletion method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All computations will be performed by commercial statistical software such as SPSS®, SAS® or&#xD;
      WinNonlin®. Microsoft Excel may be used for tabulation of the data and description&#xD;
      statistics. Graphical summaries will be presented in SAS® or WinNonlin® format.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A detailed description of the analyses to be performed will be provided in the statistical&#xD;
      analysis plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Considerations: Populations for Analysis: Intent-to Treat (ITT) population will&#xD;
      be primary analysis population. Per Protocol (PP) Population will be supportive analysis&#xD;
      population for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The descriptive statistics: Arithmetic mean (MEAN), standard deviation (SD), coefficient of&#xD;
      variation (%CV), maximal value (MAX), minimal value (MIN), and median value (MEDIAN) will be&#xD;
      applied for applicable demographic and immunological data and presented in tables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy Analysis: Primary Endpoints will be evaluated by either paired t-tests or Wilcoxon&#xD;
      signed-rank test for two-group comparisons. Repeated measures ANOVA or Friedman test will be&#xD;
      applied for more than two-group comparisons. All p values will be two-tailed; p&lt; 0.05 denoted&#xD;
      statistical significance.&#xD;
