  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal for this pilot clinical trial is to explore the accuracy and acceptability&#xD;
      of a non-invasive, wearable glucose sensor in patients living with DM. This study will&#xD;
      compare needleless glucose sensor readings with glucometer measurements from patients with&#xD;
      type 1 or type 2 diabetes (T1DM or T2DM), under varying conditions.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) can both facilitate and hinder adherence in patients&#xD;
      with diabetes mellitus (DM). Readings provide real-time information on hypoglycemic and&#xD;
      hyperglycemic excursions. These data are crucial to successfully managing this disease, as&#xD;
      SMBG can help guide decisions on titrating medications, and can potentially encourage patient&#xD;
      engagement. There are drawbacks. Piercing the skin to check glucose up to several times a day&#xD;
      can be uncomfortable and obtrusive for a patient with DM. SMBG offers only a snapshot of the&#xD;
      patient's glucose at the time of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can reveal glucose trends. A subcutaneous sensor&#xD;
      transmits interstitial glucose readings approximately every five minutes. Yet, sensor&#xD;
      insertion requires a needle. Patients still must test SMBG about 4 times per day to calibrate&#xD;
      the CGM sensor. This modality is less accurate with low or rapidly rising glucose. CGM is&#xD;
      also not widely available, due to cost and insurance issues. A non-invasive glucose monitor,&#xD;
      the GlucoWatch, was discontinued due to problems with accuracy and tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compounding these challenges is the surging number of individuals with DM. Every 19 seconds,&#xD;
      an American 20 years of age or older is diagnosed with DM. If current trends continue, 1 in 3&#xD;
      Americans could have DM by 2050.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is thus an unmet need for a non-invasive glucose monitoring device. UCSD nanoengineers&#xD;
      developed a flexible, ultra-thin sensor adherent to the skin, similar to a temporary tattoo.&#xD;
      Preliminary data from seven individuals without DM demonstrated correlation between glucose&#xD;
      measurements from this sensor and a glucometer. Evaluating this sensor in patients with DM&#xD;
      will be critical: while hour-to-hour blood glucose fluctuates approximately 50% throughout&#xD;
      the day in those without DM, it may vary up to 10-fold in patients with DM. This study would&#xD;
      be the first to examine this sensor in individuals with DM. The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that compared with a glucometer, a tattoo sensor can accurately measure glucose in patients&#xD;
      with DM.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. An existing diagnosis of diabetes mellitus, either T1DM or T2DM&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Absence of cognitive impairment, as demonstrated by a Montreal Cognitive Assessment&#xD;
             (MOCA) score greater than 26; those individuals with questionable cognitive ability&#xD;
             will be screened with this instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Ability to provide informed consent for participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Individuals without diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Those who have a MOCA score of 26 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Those who cannot speak or read English. The investigators are limiting participation&#xD;
             to those who read and speak English, as this is a pilot study of a small number of&#xD;
             participants, that will very unlikely offer the prospect of direct benefit from&#xD;
             participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individuals who have a cardiac, respiratory, or other condition that would preclude&#xD;
             safely exercising at a moderate pace. Along with a medical history and physical&#xD;
             examination by the PI, prospective participants will complete the Physical Activity&#xD;
             Readiness Questionnaire (PAR-Q) to help determine those who may safely exercise for&#xD;
             this study. One or more &quot;yes&quot; responses does not necessarily exclude an individual&#xD;
             from participating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Individuals who have frequent hypoglycemia, hypoglycemia unawareness, or who are at&#xD;
             high risk for hypoglycemia.&#xD;
