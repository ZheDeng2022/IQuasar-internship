      To quantify the severity of psoriasis in a consistent and clinically meaningful way is&#xD;
      important in order to decide the therapeutic orientation to take for the patient. PASI&#xD;
      (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) scoring is recognised as gold standard for psoriasis&#xD;
      assessment. The bodystudio ATBM (Automatic Total Body Mapping) is a high-tech system&#xD;
      performing standardized photos from head to feet and from all angles, which allows to map the&#xD;
      entire skin covering all the human body in a few minutes.The primary objective of this study&#xD;

      Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition resulting in a significant impact on&#xD;
      patients' quality of life. To quantify the severity of psoriasis in a consistent and&#xD;
      clinically meaningful way is important in order to decide the therapeutic orientation to take&#xD;
      for the patient. PASI (Psoriasis Area and Severity Index) scoring is recognised as gold&#xD;
      standard for psoriasis assessment. However the measure of the PASI score is very complex.&#xD;
      Given this complexity, the PASI is influenced by inter and intra-rater variation. In addition&#xD;
      the PASI assessment process is time consuming. The bodystudio ATBM (Automatic Total Body&#xD;
      Mapping) is a high-tech system performing standardized photos from head to feet and from all&#xD;
      angles, which allows to map the entire skin covering all the human body in a few minutes. The&#xD;
      mapping of the entire body is automatically done by the use of a digital camera performing 20&#xD;
      pictures of the patient with 8 successive positions. The system is coupled to a software of&#xD;
      automatic analysis of these pictures for the measure of the PASI score. The primary objective&#xD;
      of this study would be to evaluate the ability of the bodystudio ATBM to calculate the PASI&#xD;
      score of patients with psoriasis&#xD;
