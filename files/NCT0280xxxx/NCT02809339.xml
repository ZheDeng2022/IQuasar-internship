  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian cancer is a major cause of cancer related death among women. The disease is usually&#xD;
      advanced at diagnosis, because specialist referral is delayed due to vague nature of&#xD;
      presenting symptoms. Primary treatment is successful, but most patients experience&#xD;
      recurrence. Complaints due to disease and therapy overlap. Furthermore treatment schedules&#xD;
      are similar in response rate and survival rates. Toxicity of therapy as scored by the&#xD;
      physician is best documented, but varies depending on type of chemotherapy. Moreover most&#xD;
      knowledge is acquired in clinical trials and not in daily practice. Patient reported outcome&#xD;
      (PROs) concerning effects on symptoms, velocity of relief and quality of life (QoL) by the&#xD;
      different regimens is sparce. Also it is unknown which symptoms are best relieved. Most&#xD;
      trials take into account progression or survival as primary endpoint but not often symptom&#xD;
      relief, which is especially important for patients with recurrent disease, without no chance&#xD;
      of cure anymore. Knowledge on rating of problems and needs of patients with recurrent ovarian&#xD;
      cancer (ROC) to support them in the course of their disease is needed to come to an evidence&#xD;
      based and patient centered treatment of choice together with the patient. Physicians most&#xD;
      frequently use the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) scale for grading of side effects of&#xD;
      treatment, but discrepancies with patient experiences is high. Routine collection of PROs may&#xD;
      therefore improve patient expectations and management. In this project the investigators&#xD;
      intend to augment knowledge by PROs of different chemotherapy schedules for recurrent ovarian&#xD;
      cancer in order to improve shared decision making with the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: primary objective of this project is to explore the relief of symptoms due to ROC,&#xD;
      the speed with which this occurs by different chemotherapy schedules and development of&#xD;
      complaints due to the regimen of chemotherapy. Secondary the investigators intend (1) to&#xD;
      assess preferential symptom relief by patients, (2) to correlate toxicity and symptoms of&#xD;
      disease to tumor assessed response to chemotherapy and (3) to correlate symptom relief by&#xD;
      psychosocial context.&#xD;
