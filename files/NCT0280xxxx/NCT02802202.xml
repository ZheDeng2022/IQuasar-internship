  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To date, there are no valid and reliable pressure pain threshold scales for use in research&#xD;
      or clinical practice. The existing manual palpation protocols and scales have limited support&#xD;
      in the literature and our knowledge has not advanced since these scales were proposed in the&#xD;
      1990's. Therefore, the purpose of this investigation was to develop a valid and reliable PPTS&#xD;
      in order to provide an objective means of assessing pressure pain thresholds and create a&#xD;
      reliable method of communication among clinicians for individuals with a diagnoses&#xD;
      characterized by MPS and FM. These conditions were chosen based on their high prevalence&#xD;
      among chronic pain conditions and are also dependent upon the manual palpation examination&#xD;
      for their diagnosis.&#xD;

      The purpose of this investigation was to develop a valid and reliable PPTS in order to&#xD;
      provide an objective means of assessing pressure pain threshold and to create a reliable&#xD;
      method of communication among clinicians. Eighty-four participants (N=84) were enrolled in&#xD;
      the study and assigned to three groups: FM (N=28), MPS (N=28), and control group (N=28).&#xD;
      Participants were recruited from three sites. All participants were aged 18 to 65 years and&#xD;
      met the inclusion criteria for 1 of the 3 groups. All participants were required to read,&#xD;
      speak and write English as needed to complete forms and consent. The following criteria for&#xD;
      each group was as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Control group: Individuals with no current or prior diagnosis consistent with MPS or FM.&#xD;
           No current injuries or integumentary abnormalities at the designated palpation sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MPS group: Individuals with a diagnosis of MPS that does not meet the American College&#xD;
           of Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria for FM. No current injuries or integumentary&#xD;
           abnormalities at the designated palpation sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. FM group: Individuals who met the criteria for a diagnosis of FM based upon the ACR&#xD;
           diagnostic criteria. No current injuries or integumentary abnormalities at the&#xD;
           designated palpation sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to testing, participants filled out a screening questionnaire with questions that&#xD;
      represent the exclusion criteria which were used to determine ineligibility for this study.&#xD;
      Participants who met the inclusion criteria and consented to participate were enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. A California State University Dominguez Hills approved consent was read and signed by&#xD;
      all participants prior to beginning data collection. Following consent, participant filled&#xD;
      out a questionnaire to provide demographic information which included age, height, weight,&#xD;
      arm dominance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following completion of the paperwork, all participants underwent testing from the primary&#xD;
      investigator which was conducted between the hours of 8 am and 2pm. Participants were&#xD;
      instructed to refrain from taking any related medication (e.g. pain medication) prior to&#xD;
      testing. All participants underwent the same testing procedures and were blinded from the&#xD;
      examiner's scores and other participants enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the reliability portion of the study, a total of 20 participants (10 MPS/FM and 10&#xD;
      control group) underwent 2 days of testing. Each testing session lasted approximately 45&#xD;
      minutes. After the reliability portion was complete, all other recruited subjects underwent 1&#xD;
      day of testing which lasted approximately 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The testing process consisted of 2-parts which were based upon the American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology (ACR) diagnostic criteria for FM. The protocol required the examiner to apply&#xD;
      pressure to 18 pre-determined and 2 control points up to 4kg/cm2 at a rate of 1kg per second&#xD;
      for a total of 4 seconds at each point, one time.12, 13 For Part I, the examiner applied a&#xD;
      gradually increasing pressure using the thumb and digital pressure sensor at each&#xD;
      pre-determined tender point. For Part II, the examiner applied a gradual increasing pressure&#xD;
      using the algometer to the pre-determined tender points. For both Part I and II, the&#xD;
      participant recorded their level of discomfort at each tender point using the MTPS and VAS&#xD;
      pain scales once the examiner reached 4kg/cm2 of pressure or once a maximum level of pressure&#xD;
      was felt. Participants were able to stop testing at any time. The examiner simultaneously&#xD;
      recorded the patient's response using the PPTS scale for each tender point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collected data was transferred to SPSS v.22 (IBM SPSS, Chicago, IL). Means, standard error of&#xD;
      mean (SEM), 95% confidence intervals (95% CI), and ranges of the descriptive data from each&#xD;
      group was calculated. Group differences were calculated using the independent t-test. Six&#xD;
      clinical questions were measured in this investigation which required specific parametric and&#xD;
      non-parametric (ordinal data) statistical calculations. The P-value was considered&#xD;
      significant at the .05 level using a two-tailed test (Î±2 =.05) for all clinical questions.&#xD;
