  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Optimal infant and young child feeding practices are largely inadequate in rural and poor&#xD;
      households in Ghana. Child welfare clinics (CWCs) focus on immunization, supplementation, and&#xD;
      growth monitoring and promotion (GMP) activities among infants and young children (IYC). An&#xD;
      essential component of GMP activities is to counsel mothers to practice optimal IYC feeding&#xD;
      and health practices, but most of the time this is completely missing or not specific enough&#xD;
      to be effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will test the effect of a mass media nutrition education program on caregiver&#xD;
      infant and young child feeding knowledge, attitudes and practices using a community-based&#xD;
      cluster randomized design. Formative research will first be undertaken to determine the&#xD;
      beliefs, attitudes, and constraints that prevent caregivers from adequately feeding their&#xD;
      infants and young children with members of the community (caregivers with children&#xD;
      under-five, men and elderly women).The information gathered will then be used to design&#xD;
      specific messages that directly address the IYC feeding challenges of the community. Clusters&#xD;
      will be randomized into active (radio messages with in-person engagement and follow-up) and&#xD;
      passive (only radio messages) arms of the intervention. Farm Radio International&#xD;
      (implementers of the mass media programming) will ensure the regular broadcast of twice&#xD;
      weekly messages for a period of about 12-18 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a community-based cluster randomized controlled trial. All communities in&#xD;
      the Upper Manya Krobo District (UMKD) that are accessible 12 months of the year (with the&#xD;
      exception of 19 communities that are participating in an agriculture-education intervention)&#xD;
      will be considered eligible. These communities (n =168) will be stratified based on&#xD;
      sub-district and the median community population size for the sub-district. Four communities&#xD;
      will be randomly selected from each sub-district: two large and two small communities. These&#xD;
      24 communities will then be randomly assigned to active or passive radio engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each community will be considered a cluster. To achieve a total sample of 1258 caregivers, 52&#xD;
      women per cluster will be enrolled. If researchers are unable to enroll the sample size in&#xD;
      one community, the cluster will be expanded to include the closest village and enrolment will&#xD;
      continue until the sample size is achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment strategy. A census of all communities was completed in 2013 and will be used to&#xD;
      decide on the selection strategy. Field workers a priori will randomly select the 52&#xD;
      households in each cluster (only one mother per household, randomly chosen if there is &gt; 1).&#xD;
      If the selected household does not have a child &lt; 5 y of age, the closest house will be&#xD;
      approached. This will continue until enrolment is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Baseline survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      A baseline survey will be carried out to document the prevailing IYC feeding knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes and practices of caregivers using a semi-structured questionnaire. Questions will&#xD;
      cover:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  socio-demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  radio ownership and listening practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exposure to other sources of nutrition education in the district&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IYC feeding knowledge and practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  knowledge and awareness about anaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  knowledge and awareness about undernutrition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  knowledge, attitudes and practices about water, sanitation, and hygiene&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Formative research&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formative research will begin in only the active engagement communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total sample for the formative research will be no more than 144 women with children&#xD;
      under 5 years of age 144 men with children under 5 years of age, and 144 elderly women who&#xD;
      take care of children under 5 years of age. Participation will be solicited at a&#xD;
      community-wide meeting to explain the project. Interested individuals will be included until&#xD;
      the sample size is reached. Written informed consent will be obtained as noted below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in the formative research will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Farm Radio International (implementers of the mass media programming) will carry out the&#xD;
      focus groups to determine the beliefs, attitudes, and constraints that prevent caregivers&#xD;
      from adequately feeding their infants and young children. In addition, information on&#xD;
      radio-listening habits, time preference for programmes, and formats that are of interest to&#xD;
      the communities will be collected. Information gathered will be used to design radio&#xD;
      nutrition and health messages and jingles that directly address the IYC feeding challenges in&#xD;
      the area. Three focus group discussions will be undertaken in each of the 12 active radio&#xD;
      engagement communities. The focus groups will include 8-12 individuals each, for the&#xD;
      following groups: i) women with children under 5 years of age ii) men with children under 5&#xD;
      years of age iii) elderly women who take care of children under 5 years of age (grandmothers,&#xD;
      great aunts)&#xD;
&#xD;
      (ii) These same participants from the focus groups will be followed up and will take part in&#xD;
      monthly and quarterly assessments of the radio programming using semi-structured&#xD;
      questionnaires. The aims of these assessments are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i) obtain feedback from community members to improve content the radio messages, ii)&#xD;
      determine whether the messages are being received as intended, and iii) assess intermediary&#xD;
      adoption of messages&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: Intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interactive radio education intervention will involve weekly radio programming with local&#xD;
      radio stations on key nutrition and health topics for up to 18 months. The topics will be&#xD;
      consistent with the Ministry of Health's community nutrition and health education messages.&#xD;
      The programme will be repeated once every week. The intensity of the intervention for an&#xD;
      individual will differ based on the assignment of the participant's community:&#xD;
&#xD;
      See description of the active and passive arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 4: Post-intervention survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      An endline survey will be carried out within a maximum of 3 months after the end of the mass&#xD;
      media intervention, to determine the effect of the intervention on IYC feeding and sanitation&#xD;
      knowledge, attitudes and practices of caregivers. The questions will cover:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  recollection of key messages (free recall-no probes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  self-reported level of engagement with radio programming&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  exposure to other sources of nutrition education in the district&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  IYC feeding knowledge and practices&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  knowledge and awareness about anaemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  knowledge and awareness about undernutrition&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  knowledge, attitudes and practices about water, sanitation and hygiene The endline&#xD;
           survey will be completed with all 1258 women who participated in the baseline survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Focus Group Data All recordings of the focus group discussions will transcribed&#xD;
      from the local language (Krobo and Twi) to English and analyzed using N-Vivo version10. The&#xD;
      thematic content analysis approach will be used to analyze the data. Common themes emerging&#xD;
      from the discussions will be grouped and the results summarized based on these themes.&#xD;
      Selected quotes of participants will also be presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change from baseline in self-reported knowledge, attitudes and practices. All analysis will&#xD;
      be by intention-to-treat basis. Analyses will be performed on individual level summaries&#xD;
      using a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach. For each target knowledge, attitude and&#xD;
      behavior, the reported prevalence will be estimated at baseline and endline, and the&#xD;
      difference between surveys calculated. ANOVA tests will be used to detect differences in&#xD;
      caregiver infant and young child feeding knowledge, attitudes and practices between&#xD;
      intervention group and control group while adjusting for important baseline characteristics&#xD;
      and the effect of cluster.&#xD;
