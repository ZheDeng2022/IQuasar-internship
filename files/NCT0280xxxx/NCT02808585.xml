  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a sequential multiple-dose escalation study that will enroll (randomize&#xD;
      and dose) approximately 28 subjects in four cohorts consisting of 3 active and 1 placebo in&#xD;
      Cohort 1 and 6 active and 2 placebo in subsequent cohorts. Randomized subjects will receive a&#xD;
      fixed weekly dose of study drug or placebo for a 4 week dosing period.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Qualifying subjects will have a diagnosis of NYHA Class II or III heart failure with a&#xD;
      reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF), be in stable condition, and be taking clinician-directed&#xD;
      appropriate pharmacological therapy (e.g., angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors,&#xD;
      angiotensin receptor blockers or an evidence based beta blocker) for heart failure at stable&#xD;
      doses (with the exception of diuretics) for at least 1 month prior to screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the period between screening and randomization (planned first dose), the study subject&#xD;
      will remain on stable pharmacological therapy for heart failure. Also the study subject will&#xD;
      be in stable health with no hospitalizations or clinically significant acute illnesses&#xD;
      between screening and randomization that would put the subject at increased risk for study&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized subjects will receive a fixed weekly dose of study drug or placebo for a 4 week&#xD;
      dosing period. Dose escalation in subsequent cohorts will continue if the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic profile are deemed acceptable as assessed by the Study Review Committee.&#xD;
