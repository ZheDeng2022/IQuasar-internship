  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Antiphospholipid (APL) antibodies are a heterogeneous family of auto-antibodies,&#xD;
      predominantly represented by anticardiolipin (ACL) antibodies and lupus anticoagulant (LA).&#xD;
      Antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is defined as the presence of APL associated with venous&#xD;
      and/or arterial thrombosis or repeated foetal loss. APS may be either primary or secondary to&#xD;
      an autoimmune disease, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). However, other than in the&#xD;
      context of APS, APL can also be observed in various clinical situations and in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Published studies have reported a variable prevalence of APL in healthy subjects,&#xD;
      essentially ACL and/or LA, and their clinical significance currently remains unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have highlighted the link between APL and atherosclerosis. It therefore&#xD;
      appears interesting to more specifically study the association between the presence of APL&#xD;
      and the presence of cardiovascular risk factors in a population of healthy subjects.&#xD;
      Atherosclerosis is currently considered to be a chronic inflammatory disease arising from a&#xD;
      complex interaction between atherogenic plasma factors and cells of the arterial wall.&#xD;
      Several inflammatory markers are now known to be associated with cardiovascular risk. Lipid&#xD;
      peroxidation also plays a major role during the atherogenesis process. It will therefore also&#xD;
      be important to correlate APL with markers of vascular inflammation and markers of oxidative&#xD;
      stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective case-control study will therefore be conducted on 1,500 healthy blood donors.&#xD;
      Subjects screened APL-positive will be compared to APL-negative subjects in terms of&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors (cardiovascular risk per se, the presence of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease will not be studied). In the context of a blood donation, all subjects wishing to&#xD;
      participate in this study will attend a medical interview and a clinical examination during&#xD;
      which various data will be collected, mainly the presence of cardiovascular risk factors. A&#xD;
      blood sample will also be taken to assay the various laboratory markers studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study should provide a better understanding of the role of APL in healthy subjects and&#xD;
      more clearly specify their possible link with atherosclerosis in this population.&#xD;
