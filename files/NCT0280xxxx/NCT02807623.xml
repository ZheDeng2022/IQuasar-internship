    <textblock>
      The purpose of this clinical investigation is to evaluate the efficacy and immunologic&#xD;
      effects of a non-pharmacological exercise intervention (push-ups) compared to an oral NSAID&#xD;
      (ibuprofen) and an oral placebo to decrease local injection site inflammation symptoms of&#xD;
      delayed pain, erythema, and edema and any impact on serologic antibody immune response after&#xD;
      influenza vaccine receipt.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will evaluate the efficacy and immunologic effects of a non-pharmacological&#xD;
      exercise intervention (push-ups) compared to an oral NSAID (ibuprofen) and a blinded oral&#xD;
      placebo to decrease local injection site inflammation symptoms of delayed pain, erythema, and&#xD;
      edema and any impact on serologic antibody immune response after influenza vaccine receipt. A&#xD;
      healthy military cohort will be randomly assigned to either perform push-ups consistent with&#xD;
      their army physical fitness score, or to take a blinded oral medication which will be an&#xD;
      NSAID (ibuprofen) or an oral placebo. The study will require three visits for assessment: on&#xD;
      the day of vaccine receipt, 48-72 hours later and 21 -28 days later. The assessment visits&#xD;
      will include injection site inspection, an injection site photograph, completion of symptom&#xD;
      diaries and a validated pain scale and a laboratory blood specimen at the first and third&#xD;
      visit to measure antibody level changes. The exercise participants will also be required to&#xD;
      provide 1-2 fingerstick blood samples to evaluate for lactate, which is a byproduct of&#xD;
      anaerobic exercise to measure if level of exercise effort achieved anaerobic metabolism. The&#xD;
      study will evaluate if either of the interventions impacted perceived delayed pain, physical&#xD;
      signs of inflammation or antibody response as measured by serology.&#xD;

    <participant_flow>
      <recruitment_details>A total of 315 active-duty US Military Service Members due to receive injectable influenza vaccine (IIV) were recruited via flyers or verbal briefing from the Fort Bragg, North Carolina 82'nd Airborne Soldier Readiness Center and Walter Reed National Military Medical Center between 9/19/2016 and 11/6/2018.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>Of these 315 subjects, 15 were excluded due to the following reasons: 4 did not meet inclusion criteria, 2 declined to participate, and 9 are identified as other reasons. 300 were randomized to 1 of 3 arms. However, only 233 of the 300 returned for follow-up visits. Thus results are based on data from those 233 participants with completed data.</pre_assignment_details>

Ibuprofen: The participants will take their first dose of the study drug immediately after influenza vaccine receipt. The medication will be blinded and dispensed by a research pharmacist. The participants will receive instructions on the dosing, frequency and a recommendation to take with food or milk and will be provided a snack with their first dose.</description>

Compound Exercise of Push-ups: The participants will perform an exercise intervention of push-ups as immediately as possible but no more than 15 minutes after influenza vaccine receipt. The number of pushups performed will be at least 80% of the participants last Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) score in one session. The number of pushups will be recorded. A baseline lactate fingerstick blood specimen will be collected with either the serology sample (if possible) or from the hand opposite the vaccine receipt arm prior to performing pushups and a second finger stick sample within 3-8 minutes, but no more than 15 minutes after vaccine receipt.</description>

A baseline lactate fingerstick blood specimen will be collected with either the serology sample (if possible) or from the hand opposite the vaccine receipt arm prior to performing pushups and a second finger stick sample within 3-8 minutes, but no more than 15 minutes after vaccine receipt.</description>

Two lactate tests was performed for the exercise group at Visit 1, both pre and post Influenza vaccination. The first lactate reading was taken after the blood draw.The second lactate reading was obtained from a fingerstick from the hand opposite to the vaccination arm, ideally within 3-8 minutes after the study subject completes pushups.</description>

Compound Exercise of Push-ups: The participants will perform an exercise intervention of push-ups as immediately as possible but no more than 15 minutes after influenza vaccine receipt. The number of pushups performed will be at least 80% of the participants last Army Physical Fitness Test (APFT) score in one session. The number of pushups will be recorded. A baseline lactate fingerstick blood specimen will be collected with either the serology sample (if possible) or from the hand opposite the vaccine receipt arm prior to performing pushups and a second finger stick sample within 3-8 minutes, but no more than 15 minutes after vaccine receipt.</description>
