  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a chronic, progressive, neurodegenerative disease that affects 1%&#xD;
      of the population older than 60 years. The disease presents as a movement disorder&#xD;
      manifesting mainly with resting tremor, bradykinesia, cogwheel rigidity and postural&#xD;
      instability along with cognitive and behavioral disturbances and symptoms of other non-motor&#xD;
      systems dysfunction. The pathophysiology of the motor dysfunction in PD is related to gradual&#xD;
      loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons (originating from the substantia nigra (SN)&#xD;
      compacta to the striatum) leading eventually to depletion of dopamine in the striatum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Striatal fluorine-18 isotopologue for L-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine([18F] F-DOPA) uptake&#xD;
      follows a typical spatiotemporal pattern along the course of disease starting with a&#xD;
      decreased uptake in the dorso-caudal putamen (contralateral to the side of predominant motor&#xD;
      involvement) that progress to the caudate nucleus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of traditional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the evaluation of PD is aimed&#xD;
      mainly to differentiate idiopathic PD from secondary parkinsonism (e.g. vascular) and from&#xD;
      other degenerative but atypical parkinsonian syndromes (e.g.Progressive supranuclear palsy (&#xD;
      PSP), Multiple system atrophy (MSA) etc.) that are associated with distinct structural&#xD;
      features and therefore help establishing the diagnosis. However, new MR sequences such as&#xD;
      diffuse tensor imaging (DTI) and susceptibility-weighted imaging (SWI) are now being&#xD;
      investigated to evaluate the nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons and iron accumulation in the&#xD;
      SN, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) that depicts brain network&#xD;
      organization has been shown to be altered in patients with PD. In this technique, temporally&#xD;
      synchronous, spatially distributed, spontaneous low frequency blood-oxygen level-dependent&#xD;
      signal fluctuations in task-free settings are further clustered into maps of functional&#xD;
      large-scale neural networks. Lower network efficiency that worsens as disease progresses has&#xD;
      been shown in patients with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, it has been shown that the integration of MRI and PET is technically feasible. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that PET/MRI offers true multimodality imaging by combining anatomy,&#xD;
      function and molecular processes that will allow more accurate identification of disease&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, this will be the first study to evaluate idiopathic PD (IPD)&#xD;
      with 18F FDOPA PET/MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of the modality and to evaluate both&#xD;
      visually and quantitatively the association between the dopamine metabolism measured in the&#xD;
      striatum by 18F-FDOPA PET with structural and functional MR findings in patients diagnosed&#xD;
      with IPD with asymmetrical motor signs.&#xD;

      Study Objectives and Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility of 18F FDOPA PET/MR in the setting of IPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To correlate and compare pattern of dynamic and/or static 18F-FDOPA uptake in the&#xD;
           striatum with MR findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the different variables between the contra and ipsilateral hemispheric side&#xD;
           of predominant motor involvement in patients with asymmetric motor disturbances.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: This is a prospective, pilot, cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with IPD suffering from asymmetrical motor signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible consecutive patients, satisfying the inclusion criteria, will be identified and&#xD;
      recruited by neurological clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed consent: Before enrollment, written informed consent will be obtained from each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant Sampling: All patients fulfilling inclusion criteria and providing informed&#xD;
      consent will be consecutively enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Imaging diagnostic PET/MR protocol All scans will be performed in the department of Nuclear&#xD;
      Medicine at Tel-Aviv Assuta Medical Center using a PET/MR scanner (Biograph mMR, Siemens AG,&#xD;
      Erlangen, Germany) in accordance with the manufacturer's guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients are required to fast at least 4 hours prior to arrival to the department. Upon&#xD;
      arrival an intravenous catheter will be placed for radiopharmaceutical and gadolinium&#xD;
      administration. Patients will receive an intravenous injection of 10 Millicurie (mCi) of&#xD;
      18F-FDOPA on the PET MR table and scanning will begin immediately. Dynamic PET parameters&#xD;
      will be acquired along with the different MR sequences. MR of the brain will include the&#xD;
      following sequences: T1, T2 and T2 fluid attenuated inversion recovery sequence (FLAIR),&#xD;
      susceptibility-weighted sequences (SWI), blood-oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signals for&#xD;
      resting-state functional imaging. In addition, perfusion of the brain will be evaluated with&#xD;
      and without gadolinium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For contrast-enhanced sequences the investigators use Dotarem (gadoteric acid)(0.2 ml/kg ,0.1&#xD;
      mmol/kg at 2ml/s, 20ml saline flush) The total scan time will be about 45 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For eligible patients, the following data will be recorded at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline parameters: date of birth, sex, age at diagnosis and (motor) symptoms onset.&#xD;

           Uptake Values (SUV) SUVmax and SUVmean) will be performed in the putamen and caudate&#xD;
           nucleus bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Measurements of dynamic F-DOPA parameters when available ( e.g., time to peak, peak&#xD;
           value etc.) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Patient characteristics will be summarized using descriptive statistics.&#xD;
      Quantitative variables will be presented as mean and SD, qualitative variables will be&#xD;
      presented as frequencies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pearson correlation coefficient will be used to measure the strength of the relationship&#xD;
      between the PET and the MR parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A t-test will be used to compare the mean values of the different parameters. Sample size:&#xD;
      This is a pilot study for which a sample size of 40 patients is required.&#xD;
