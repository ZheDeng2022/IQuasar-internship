  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators have developed an assay that can sensitively and specifically detect DNA&#xD;
      mutations circulating in human plasma that may be indicators of the presence of a solid&#xD;
      tumor. This study is a pilot study to measure positive and negative predictive values of this&#xD;
      assay as an indicator of the presence of a tumor in normal subjects&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants consenting for the study will be requested to consent for an initial collection&#xD;
      of two vials of blood (~ 20 ml total) and to answer questions regarding aspects of their&#xD;
      medical history and lifestyle that are relevant to cancer risk. Participants in the study&#xD;
      will also be asked to provide consent for follow-up blood samples, and if the confirmatory&#xD;
      tests show a positive result, follow-up PET/CT scans and other investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1,000 participants between the ages of 55 and 75 will be enrolled through BC Generations&#xD;
      Project. This is a invite-only study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Respondents who provide consent and choose to be enrolled in the study will then be&#xD;
           directed to an online questionnaire where they will be asked to answer questions&#xD;
           regarding their lifestyle and medical history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The consent form and questionnaire results will be electronically received at the UBC&#xD;
           study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once participant information has been received at UBC, it will be entered into a&#xD;
           password protected spreadsheet on a UBC server. At that point, participants will be sent&#xD;
           a requisition form directing them to one of several possible blood collection sites&#xD;
           (LifeLabs), where two 10mL blood draws will be collected by a phlebotomist. Blood&#xD;
           collections will be paid for by Boreal through a contract with LifeLabs, and will be&#xD;
           performed in Streck stabilized cfDNA blood collection tubes (capable of storing blood at&#xD;
           room temperature for over a week).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once collected, the two blood tubes will be delivered by LifeLabs to BC Cancer Research&#xD;
           Center within 24-48 hrs of collection. The tubes will be collected by study staff&#xD;
           (within 5 days of the initial blood draw) and transported to UBC, where they will be&#xD;
           de-identified and assigned a random identifier (UBC study number). Any personal&#xD;
           identification on the tubes will be completely removed, by abrasion if necessary.&#xD;
           Identifying information will be entered in a password protected spreadsheet (on a UBC&#xD;
           server) linking the participant information to the UBC study number. From this point on,&#xD;
           the blood samples, and subsequent fractions and results, will only be identified by the&#xD;
           study number. The de-identified tubes will be transported to Boreal Genomics where they&#xD;
           will be separated into plasma and cellular fraction including erythrocytes and buffy&#xD;
           coat. The non-plasma components of the blood samples will be pooled and subsequently&#xD;
           discarded. The plasma fraction will be placed in a separate tube and frozen for&#xD;
           subsequent analysis. The original blood tubes (now empty), will be destroyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frozen plasma samples, now de-identified, will be delivered to Pathway Genomics (San&#xD;
           Diego, CA) where DNA content will be analyzed with a circulating tumor DNA assay&#xD;
           employing the UBC/Boreal Genomics enrichment technology. All of the participants' plasma&#xD;
           will be sent to Pathway, where it will be used up in the assay. Any plasma not consumed&#xD;
           in the assay will be destroyed. No plasma, blood or other samples will be stored at&#xD;
           either Pathway Genomics or UBC, beyond any temporary storage (1-2 weeks) required to&#xD;
           perform the assay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Circulating tumor DNA assay results (raw sequencing data) from Pathway Genomics will be&#xD;
           returned to UBC and analyzed for the presence of cancer mutations. Any samples showing&#xD;
           activating mutations above the assay's technical Limit of Detection (LOD) will be called&#xD;
           positive. One exception will be made for TP53 mutations that are known to exist in some&#xD;
           normal individuals at low levels. For these mutations, a level of 0.1% will be set,&#xD;
           above which the sample will be called positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Once the data is analyzed, participants with a negative result will be sent an email&#xD;
           thanking them for their participation and informing them of the negative result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants whose sample provided a positive result will be contacted immediately by&#xD;
           telephone by an oncologist co-investigator and concurrently sent a letter by mail&#xD;
           informing them of the result and asking them to return for a second blood draw. The&#xD;
           investigators expect that this communication will happen with about a month of the&#xD;
           original blood draw. The letter will include contact information for the study team and&#xD;
           the oncologist co-investigators, in case the participant has any questions or concerns&#xD;
           at this stage. A requisition form will be sent with the letter. Two 10mL tubes of blood&#xD;
           will be drawn at the blood collection visit, to allow repeat testing and confirmation&#xD;
           that the mutation is present consistently.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Samples from the additional draw will be treated as described above for the initial&#xD;
           samples, with two exceptions. One, the samples will be processed at Boreal Genomics&#xD;
           instead of being shipped to Pathway Genomics. Two, some buffy coat DNA (germline DNA)&#xD;
           will also be tested for the 96 cancer mutations present on the Boreal panel to detect&#xD;
           rare cases where the circulating tumor DNA signal derives from low level germline&#xD;
           mutations instead of tumor DNA. This testing will be done at Boreal Genomics and any&#xD;
           remaining buffy coat or DNA not consumed in the test will be discarded. Data from the&#xD;
           circulating tumor DNA assay and buffy coat test will be returned to UBC and compared to&#xD;
           the initial blood result.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants who are found to have a cancer-associated germline mutation during the&#xD;
           foregoing testing will be informed by the oncologist co-investigators and will be&#xD;
           offered a consultation with the Hereditary Cancer Program at the BC Cancer Agency where&#xD;
           they can meet with a medical geneticist for a consultation. If they wish it, these&#xD;
           participants would have access to clinically validated retesting for the germline&#xD;
           mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants for which the additional blood sample does not yield positive results for&#xD;
           cancer mutations, will be contacted by telephone to explain the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants for whom the additional blood sample yields a positive result for the same&#xD;
           cancer mutations seen in the first blood draw will be contacted by telephone by an&#xD;
           oncologist co-investigator, to explain the results and next steps. They will also be&#xD;
           sent a letter. The investigators expect this communication to happen within about a week&#xD;
           of the second blood draw. Pending oncological evaluation of the participant (see below)&#xD;
           and study results, a PET-CT scan with fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) agent, and possibly other&#xD;
           tests will be requested. Unless the oncological exams suggest otherwise, the default&#xD;
           follow-up will be a full body PET-CT. The participants undergoing medical imaging scans&#xD;
           will be given a requisition form and directed to have the requested scan, which will be&#xD;
           paid for by the study sponsor (Boreal Genomics).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recognizing that being advised of an abnormal DNA test may cause participants distress,&#xD;
           the investigators have committed to (a) complete testing and to contact the participant&#xD;
           about the result of 2nd test within 14 days of the blood being drawn; (b) notification&#xD;
           of 2nd result (abnormal or normal) being done by phone by the study oncologist (c)&#xD;
           pre-booking the follow-up oncological evaluation appointment and offering the&#xD;
           participant two options when phoned to advise of the 2nd abnormal result (d) completing&#xD;
           the oncological evaluation within 3 weeks of the patient being advised that the 2nd test&#xD;
           is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The oncological evaluation will be performed at the Vancouver Centre of the BC Cancer&#xD;
           Agency and is likely to include:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A full history, including risk factors for cancer and a review of systems to seek&#xD;
                symptoms that could be from cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A physical examination of:&#xD;
&#xD;
                - Head and neck, thorax, abdomen, skin, neurological system lymphatic system and&#xD;
                rectum. In men: prostate examination. In women: breast and gynecological&#xD;
                examinations&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A whole-body PET-CT scan&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Standard age-appropriate cancer screening investigations such as the fecal&#xD;
                immunochemical test (FIT) for colorectal cancer, Papanicolaou test for cervix&#xD;
                cancer and mammography for breast cancer, if they have not been completed, are due,&#xD;
                or are overdue.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Additional investigations will be guided by the history, physical examination,&#xD;
                whole-body PET-CT and standard screening investigations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Investigations may include: complete blood count, liver enzymes, tumour markers,&#xD;
                urinalysis, contrast-enhanced MRI, contrast-enhanced CT, as well as endoscopy of&#xD;
                the head and neck, bronchi, bladder, upper GI tract and lower GI tract.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results of these tests will be returned to the oncologist investigators and to Dr.&#xD;
           Marziali and then entered into the study database. The results will be communicated to&#xD;
           the participant in writing as well as in person or by phone. The oncologist will refer&#xD;
           participants for additional testing and to appropriate clinicians for follow up for&#xD;
           additional investigations. The oncologist will also offer a referral of participants to&#xD;
           supportive counseling at this stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The results will be communicated to the participant's family physician, if the&#xD;
           participant has one, by an oncologist investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants whose investigations detect a potentially malignant mass will have a&#xD;
           biopsy, either with imaging guidance, or through referral to an appropriate specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants, whose investigations do not detect a potentially malignant mass, will be&#xD;
           informed in writing, as well as in person or by phone that the circulating tumor DNA&#xD;
           test gave a false positive result and will be advised to continue with appropriate&#xD;
           cancer screening for their age and family history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with positive circulating tumor DNA results who are unwilling to undergo&#xD;
           further testing including possible PET-CTs will still be offered a follow up visit with&#xD;
           the oncologist co-investigator to discuss the results and to offer supportive counseling&#xD;
           as described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A year following the initial blood draw, participants will be contacted by email to&#xD;
           determine if a cancer diagnosis has been made during that time. For non-responding&#xD;
           participants, they will be telephoned and their family physicians will be sent a letter&#xD;
           inquiring whether the participant was diagnosed with cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected in this study will be provided to BC Generations Project.&#xD;
