      The purpose of this study is to determine the activity of SY-1425 in relapsed/refractory&#xD;
      acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (SY-1425 administered as a monotherapy or in&#xD;
      combination with azacitidine), relapsed/refractory higher-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS)&#xD;
      patients (SY-1425 administered as a monotherapy or in combination with daratumumab), newly&#xD;
      diagnosed treatment naïve AML patients who are unlikely to tolerate standard intensive&#xD;
      chemotherapy (SY-1425 administered as a monotherapy or in combination with azacitidine), or&#xD;
      lower-risk myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) patients (SY-1425 administered as a monotherapy).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, open-label study exploring the activity of SY-1425 in&#xD;
      patients with relapsed or refractory non-APL AML, relapsed or refractory higher-risk MDS,&#xD;
      newly diagnosed treatment naïve AML, or transfusion dependent, lower-risk MDS. All patients&#xD;
      must be evaluated for the RARA super-enhancer associated biomarker or RARA pathway biomarker&#xD;
      at the time of the study screening evaluation. Patients will accrue to each of the six arms&#xD;
      based on diagnosis, prior treatment, risk group, and investigator choice of treatment&#xD;
      (SY-1425 single agent or in combination with azacitidine or daratumumab). SY-1425 will be&#xD;
      administered at 6 mg/m2/day orally divided in two doses. SY-1425 will be given on a 28-day&#xD;
      treatment cycle and dosing will be continuous. For those newly diagnosed treatment naïve and&#xD;
      relapsed refractory AML patients receiving the combination of SY-1425 and azacitidine,&#xD;
      azacitidine will be administered at 75 mg/m2/day IV or SC days 1-7, and SY-1425 will be&#xD;
      administered at 6 mg/m2/day orally divided in two doses days 8-28 on a 28-day treatment&#xD;
      cycle. For those relapsed or refractory non-APL AML and relapsed or refractory higher-risk&#xD;
      MDS patients receiving the combination of SY-1425 and daratumumab, SY-1425 daily dosing (dose&#xD;
      level described above) will begin with a 7-day lead-in followed by continuous dosing on a&#xD;
      28-day treatment cycle. Daratumumab will be administered at a dose of 16 mg/kg starting on&#xD;
      Cycle 1 Day 1 weekly for 8 weeks (8 dose total), followed by dosing every 2 weeks for 16&#xD;
      weeks (8 doses total), followed by dosing every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosing will continue unless: the patient experiences unacceptable toxicity, disease&#xD;
      progression/relapse, pursues post-remission therapy other than SY-1425 (single agent or in&#xD;
      combination with azacitidine or daratumumab), or the Investigator determines it is in the&#xD;
      best interest of the patient to discontinue treatment. Newly diagnosed AML patients who&#xD;
      achieve a CR/CRi or PR while on SY-1425 single agent treatment and then relapse, or who fail&#xD;
      to achieve a CR/CRi or PR after completing at least 4 cycles of SY-1425 single agent&#xD;
      treatment, are eligible to receive SY-1425 in combination with azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower-risk MDS patients will be withdrawn from the study at week 24 if they do not have at&#xD;
      least a minor erythroid response. Lower-risk MDS patients who in the opinion of the&#xD;
      investigator are receiving clinical benefit, but do not meet the minor erythroid response&#xD;
      criteria can remain on study with sponsor approval. Lower-risk MDS patients who continue past&#xD;
      week 24 will continue to receive treatment until erythroid relapse, disease progression, or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An end of treatment visit will be conducted for all AML and higher-risk MDS patients within&#xD;
      30 days of the last dose of study drug, but prior to the start of any subsequent therapies to&#xD;
      monitor for safety and resolution of adverse events. For lower-risk MDS patients, the end of&#xD;
      treatment visit will also be the end of study visit which will be conducted 30 days after the&#xD;
      last dose of study drug. All AML and higher-risk MDS patients will be followed every three&#xD;
      months for survival for up to 2 years and patients who are withdrawn prior to relapse will&#xD;
      also follow-up for event free survival.&#xD;
