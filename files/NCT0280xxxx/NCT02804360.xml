      Purpose: Cystoid macular edema (CME) in retinitis pigmentosa (RP) has been managed in several&#xD;
      ways with little success. The aim of our study was to report the use of intravitreal&#xD;
      dexamethasone implant in a large series of patients with RP and CME.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Retrospective case series. Methods: Cases were diagnosed as RP based on the classic&#xD;
      fundus triad of bone-spicule pigment deposits (intraretinal pigmentary migration), retinal&#xD;
      vessel attenuation, waxy pallor of the optic disc along with night blindness and attenuated&#xD;
      ERG amplitudes (delays in rod or cone b-wave implicit times). Family history of RP and family&#xD;
      screening for RP were important in establishing the diagnosis in eyes with some diagnostic&#xD;
      challenge. CME was diagnosed by intravitreous fluorescein angiography IVFA and spectral&#xD;
      domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). BCVA was monitored using Snellen visual acuity&#xD;
      chart and CME was monitored by SD-OCT on follow-up visits.&#xD;

      Introduction Retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is a group of inherited progressive retinal&#xD;
      degenerations characterized by photoreceptor dysfunction primarily affecting the rods,&#xD;
      followed by cones with worldwide prevalence of approximately one in 3,000-4,000 for a total&#xD;
      of 2 million affected individuals all over the world. After rods die, cone photoreceptors&#xD;
      gradually die resulting in constriction of visual fields and eventual blindness in many&#xD;
      patients. There is presently no cure for RP where photoreceptor apoptosis plays a key role,&#xD;
      but considerable effort is devoted to the search of rescue strategies. This condition can&#xD;
      lead to blindness in the advanced stages of disease, when it involves the central retina.&#xD;
      Also macular abnormalities appear frequently in RP leading to visual decline. CME is&#xD;
      prevalent in 20-70% of RP patients and several treatment options were reported with variable&#xD;
      success rates and with many side-effects. Therapies have included oral or topical carbonic&#xD;
      anhydrase inhibitors, intravitreal VEGF antagonists, and periocular or intravitreal&#xD;
      corticosteroids. The dexamethasone implant has been recently approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      maculopathies related to diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion or uveitis. The&#xD;
      current study explores the role of such implant in CME from RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods The investigators conducted a retrospective noncomparative study of the use of&#xD;
      intravitreal dexamethasone implant in eyes with CME from RP. The study adhered to the tenets&#xD;
      of the declaration of Helsinki. All patients signed an informed consent after detailed review&#xD;
      of the benefits and complications of current therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RP is defined as the presence of the triad of bone-spicule pigment deposits, retinal vessel&#xD;
      attenuation and waxy pallor of the optic disc. Family history of RP, family screening for RP,&#xD;
      and ERG recordings were ancillary tests in atypical RP. CME is defined as the presence of&#xD;
      cystoid changes in the macula seen on linear scans by spectral domain OCT regardless of&#xD;
      presence of retinal thickening (Gorovoy). Primary outcomes were best-corrected visual acuity&#xD;
      and central macular thickness. Study duration was January 2012?? to December 2015 with all&#xD;
      participants signing a formal consent. Inclusion criteria included naïve or previously&#xD;
      treated CME. Exclusion criteria included diabetes mellitus, vitreous hemorrhage, macular&#xD;
      ischemia, macular scar from subretinal fibrosis, corneal scar, infectious conjunctivitis,&#xD;
      prior cataract or vitreous surgery, and inability to commit for long-term follow-up. Primary&#xD;
      outcome measures included best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) assessed by Snellen charts and&#xD;
      central macular thickness (CMT, mean thickness in the central 1000-μm diameter area) using&#xD;
      spectral domain optical coherence tomography (OCT). Intravenous fluorescein angiography was&#xD;
      done at the initial exam using standard protocol with visualization of the retinal&#xD;
      midperiphery. Comprehensive ocular examination including applanation tonometry was performed&#xD;
      at baseline, and usually at month 1, months 2 and months 3 and thereafter. Ozurdex®&#xD;
      (Allergan, Inc., Irvine, CA, USA) is an intravitreal rod shaped implant containing 0.7 mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone in the Novadur® poly (D,L-lactide-co-glycolide solid polymer sustained-release&#xD;
      drug delivery system. The implant was injected under sterile conditions using povidone iodine&#xD;
      5%, sterile lid speculum and topical anesthesia. Only one patient who was 9-year old received&#xD;
      sedative agents in order to achieve patient cooperation. The single-use applicator was&#xD;
      injected into the midvitreous through a self-sealing scleral injection 3,5 mm posterior to&#xD;
      the limbus at the superotemporal or inferotemporal area. Genetic testing was not carried in&#xD;
      the current case series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were done using SPSS version 22 (IBM Corporation, Chicago, Illinois) and&#xD;
      Wilcoxon-Signed Rank Test with significance set at p-value of 0.05.&#xD;
