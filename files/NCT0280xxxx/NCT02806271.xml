    <textblock>
      Worry postponement is a commonly recommended treatment component in cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy for Generalized Anxiety Disorder in which people are asked to postpone naturally&#xD;
      occurring instances of worry to a designated 30 minute &quot;worry period&quot; later in the day.&#xD;
      Despite being commonly recommended, there is little known about the efficacy and mechanisms&#xD;
      of worry postponement. The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and mechanisms&#xD;
      of change of a two-week worry postponement intervention in people with Generalized Anxiety&#xD;
      Disorder. Ninety subjects with generalized anxiety disorder will be randomly assigned to two&#xD;
      weeks of daily worry postponement, two weeks of worry monitoring, or an assessment only&#xD;
      control condition. Changes in worry or associated features will be examined at post&#xD;
      intervention and at a 2-week follow up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD) is a disorder characterized by excessive and&#xD;
      uncontrollable worry. People with GAD report that worry significantly interferes with their&#xD;
      ability to enjoy their life and function effectively in their roles. Worry postponement is a&#xD;
      treatment technique developed by Borkovec and colleagues (1983) to reduce excessive worry. In&#xD;
      worry postponement, people are instructed to notice naturally occurring episodes of worry and&#xD;
      to then disengage from their worry and postpone it to a designated 30 minute &quot;worry period&quot;&#xD;
      later in the day. People are instructed to confine their worry to this 30 minute period and&#xD;
      to use that period to problem solve concerns they have been having. Worry postponement is a&#xD;
      widely recommended technique for treating excessive worry in people with GAD and is often&#xD;
      combined with other cognitive-behavioural interventions. Despite being commonly recommended,&#xD;
      there are very few studies demonstrating worry postponement's efficacy for reducing worry,&#xD;
      and no studies have looked at the effect of this intervention in people with GAD. The present&#xD;
      study aims to extend the literature by comparing a two-week worry postponement intervention&#xD;
      to worry monitoring alone and to an assessment only control condition. Participants will&#xD;
      complete baseline self-report measures of worry and associated symptoms and cognitive&#xD;
      processes. They will complete three computer tasks measuring attention control. They will&#xD;
      then be randomized to one of three conditions (worry postponement, worry monitoring,&#xD;
      assessment only control). Participants will follow instructions corresponding to their&#xD;
      condition daily for two weeks. In the worry postponement and worry monitoring conditions this&#xD;
      will involve completing brief daily worry questionnaires at home for the two weeks of the&#xD;
      intervention. In the assessment only condition participants will not complete any measures&#xD;
      during the two weeks after the first session. Subsequent to this, all participants will&#xD;
      return to the lab to repeat baseline measures, and will return again two weeks later to&#xD;
      complete measures. The entire study will require three lab visits, spanning over four weeks.&#xD;
      This study aims to determine what the effects of worry postponement are, relative to worry&#xD;
      monitoring and assessment only, on worry, GAD and associated symptoms, and cognitive&#xD;
      processes related to worry. A secondary aim of this study is to examine which mechanisms&#xD;
      predict change in worry in a worry postponement study. This will be the first study to our&#xD;
      knowledge, to examine these questions in a sample of people with GAD. This study will provide&#xD;
      important information for optimizing the treatment of worry in people with GAD.&#xD;

    <description>In worry postponement, participants are instructed to learn to notice naturally occurring episodes of worry. When they notice they are worrying they are instructed to disengage from their worry and postpone it to a designated 30 minute &quot;worry period&quot; to be carried out at the same time and place daily during the two week intervention. Participants are to use their worry time to worry about problems that have come up during the day and to problem solve where appropriate.</description>

Participants are instructed to make a record each time they have a worry episode by briefly describing the content of their worry. Participants also complete two brief daily questionnaires about the duration of their worry, the intensity of their worry, their ability to disengage from their worry, and the occurrence of nighttime episodes of worry.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Endorse symptoms consistent with a primary diagnosis of Generalized Anxiety Disorder&#xD;
             (GAD) as defined by DSM-5 (APA, 2013), with a clinician severity rating (CSR) ≥ 4&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If a comorbid diagnosis is present, its associated CSR is at least 1 point lower than&#xD;
             that of their GAD diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a current or past history of psychosis or mania, or endorse symptoms consistent&#xD;
             with a diagnosis of a substance use disorder in the past 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Report clinically significant suicidal ideation, intent, or plan&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Participants will be excluded if they are currently receiving psychological treatment&#xD;
             or counseling (e.g., cognitive behaviour therapy, supportive counseling, etc.), unless&#xD;
             this treatment is infrequent (meeting once monthly or less) or the participant has&#xD;
             been receiving consistent weekly treatment for 12 weeks and still meets all other&#xD;
             eligibility criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are taking psychotropic medications and have had a change in dose in the past 12&#xD;
             weeks. If they have recently discontinued a psychotropic medication, they will be&#xD;
             included if it has been at least 1 month since discontinuation, or 3 months if they&#xD;
             had been taking fluoxetine/Prozac. If a participant is taking psychotropic medication&#xD;
             on an as needed basis (e.g., benzodiazepines), they will be included and their use of&#xD;
             this medication will be noted in order to assess whether it has a moderating effect on&#xD;
             intervention outcome.&#xD;
