    <textblock>
      The study is a phase 2, monocentric, open-label study. The investigators will recruit 12&#xD;
      patients with T1D to be randomly (1:1) assigned to receive islet either into the liver&#xD;
      through the portal venous circulation (standard procedure; arm A, n=6) or directly into the&#xD;
      omentum (arm B, n=6). Patients will be selected from those eligible for islet Tx based on&#xD;
      local practice and guidelines. Immunosuppression will consist of five doses IV infusion of&#xD;
      rabbit Anti-thymocyte Globulin (ATG, Thymoglobulin®), starting two days prior to the islet&#xD;
      transplant. Maintenance mycophenolate mofetil (MMF) therapy (1-2 g/day as BID dosing) will be&#xD;
      started on Day -1 pre-transplant. Tacrolimus will be administered orally twice daily on Day 1&#xD;
      post-transplant to maintain a trough level of 10-12 ng/mL for 3 months, then 6-10 ng/mL&#xD;
      thereafter. Etanercept will be given IV before the islet transplant (50 mg), and then at 25&#xD;
      mg (subcutaneously) on POD +3, +7 and +10.&#xD;

    <description>Liver infusion: the islet mixture is delivered slowly via injection through a syringe attached to the catheter in the portal vein or portal vein tributary. Access to the portal vein is achieved by percutaneous transhepatic access under fluoroscopic, ultrasonographic, or real-time CT guidance. Alternatively access to a mesenteric or omental venous tributary of the portal vein can be obtained by mini-laparotomy under general anesthesia (transplant site preference or in the extremely rare circumstance that percutaneous access cannot be achieved). At a minimum, portal pressure will be monitored before and after infusion of the islet product. Portal pressure measurements will be documented in the medical record. Gel foam plugs and/or collagen/thrombin paste will be used to embolize the entire peripheral catheter tract immediately before the catheter is withdrawn, to reduce the chances of bleeding.</description>

    <description>Omentum infusion: briefly, islets are spread in the surface of the omentum, in a single omental pouch site. Transplanting in a single site will reduce risks. A single dose of at least 5000 IEQ/KG will be transplanted. The investigators should be able to achieve a meaningful metabolic improvement and prevention of severe hypoglycemia, as previously seen in experience with intraportal islet transplants. Recombinant human thrombin is added to the islets placed on the omentum to promote formation of a gel clot and facilitate adherence to the surface of the omentum. A pouch is then created by folding the omentum. The pouch is secured inn place with stitches.</description>

    <description>This is a single procedure protocol. Only a single islet transplant will be performed in the patient. Islets can be isolated from more than one pancreas donor. The final islet product is a sterile suspension of ≥70% viable, ≥30% pure, allogeneic islets. A minimum of 5000 IEQ/KG will be transplanted. Although this study is a single dose protocol, islet transplant recipients with partial islet graft function will be considered for a second islet transplant (intra-hepatic administration) if they do not achieve primary efficacy endpoint criteria at 1 year</description>
