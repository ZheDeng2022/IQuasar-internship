    <textblock>
      This study is a first-in-human, phase I, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single&#xD;
      center study evaluating single and multiple ascending intravenous doses of FR104 in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      64 healthy male and female subjects are selected according to the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria, i.e., 50 subjects in Part 1 (SAD: 2 cohorts of 22 [Cohort A], 28 [Cohort B],&#xD;
      respectively) and 14 subjects in Part 2 (MAD). The total duration of the study is 10 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All FR104 doses are administered intravenously by a slow infusion of at least 30 minutes. A&#xD;
      staggered approach is observed within all dose levels. An interval of at least 14 days (last&#xD;
      to first administration) is observed between all dose levels. Individual subjects on a same&#xD;
      day of dosing are dosed at least 60 minutes apart.&#xD;
