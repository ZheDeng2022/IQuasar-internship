    <textblock>
      The number of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) implanted each year has grown&#xD;
      rapidly over the past two decades. CIED infections, defined as infections involving the&#xD;
      generator implant site (pocket) and/or intravascular leads, have become increasingly&#xD;
      prevalent, with the rate of growth in infections outpacing that of CIED procedures. The odds&#xD;
      of both short term and long term mortality are at least doubled in patients who suffer CIED&#xD;
      infections, and long term survival is particularly poor in women. Optimal strategies to&#xD;
      prevent CIED infections in high-risk patients are largely unproven. However, recent&#xD;
      observational studies of an antibiotic-coated envelope implanted at the time of CIED&#xD;
      procedure have shown that this strategy is associated with a low incidence of CIED&#xD;
      infections. Other interventions to prevent CIED infections, including the use of antibiotic&#xD;
      irrigant used to wash the pocket during implantation and postoperative oral antibiotics, are&#xD;
      commonly used but not supported by rigorous controlled studies. The Specific Aim of this&#xD;
      study is to test the hypothesis that the use of the antibacterial envelope alone is&#xD;
      noninferior to a strategy using the antibacterial envelope and intraoperative antibacterial&#xD;
      irrigant and postoperative oral antibiotics for the reduction of cardiac implantable device&#xD;
      infections in patients with ≥2 risk factors for infection.&#xD;

      1.0 Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of cardiac implantable electronic devices (CIEDs) implanted each year has grown&#xD;
      rapidly over the past two decades, largely due to expanding use of implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and devices capable of delivering cardiac&#xD;
      resynchronization therapy (CRT). CIEDs have increasingly been utilized in older patients with&#xD;
      multiple medical comorbidities. As a result CIED infections, defined as infections involving&#xD;
      the generator implant site (pocket) and/or intravascular leads, have become increasingly&#xD;
      prevalent, with the rate of growth in infections outpacing that of CIED procedures. The&#xD;
      increase in incidence of CIED infections has outpaced the growth in device implantation, in&#xD;
      large part due to the medical complexity of today's CIED patients. These devastating&#xD;
      complications are associated with significant cost, morbidity, and mortality. The odds of&#xD;
      both short term and long term mortality are at least doubled in patients who suffer CIED&#xD;
      infections, and long term survival is particularly poor in women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient-specific risk factors for CIED infections have been examined in multiple registries&#xD;
      and case-control studies. For patients with at least two risk factors, the reported incidence&#xD;
      of CIED infection is 2-3%. Management of these infections is complex and expensive. The&#xD;
      cornerstone of management is the complete removal of all infected hardware whenever possible,&#xD;
      which in itself poses significant risks for patients. Therefore prevention of infections is&#xD;
      crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Best practices for reducing CIED infections are an active area of research. Since most&#xD;
      infections occur as a result of bacterial seeding at the time of device implantation or&#xD;
      revision, careful attention to strict sterile technique is mandatory. Optimal skin&#xD;
      preparation and perioperative intravenous antibiotics have been associated with a reduced&#xD;
      rate of CIED infections in randomized controlled studies. Additionally, several recent&#xD;
      retrospective studies have suggested an important role of the minocycline and rifampin&#xD;
      impregnated TYRX antibacterial envelope in reducing infections. The device consists of 2&#xD;
      polypropylene mesh sheets joined on 3 sides with a 3mm seam and is available in 2 sizes to&#xD;
      accommodate pacemaker and ICD pulse generators. This polypropylene envelope releases&#xD;
      minocycline and rifampin from a bioresorbable polyarylate polymer over approximately 7 days,&#xD;
      directly into the CIED generator pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aside from optimal skin preparation and perioperative intravenous antibiotics, other&#xD;
      practices to reduce the risk of CIED infections vary widely. Many operators use an&#xD;
      antibacterial solution (e.g., polymyxin-B/bacitracin) to irrigate the pocket during device&#xD;
      implantation. Additionally, many centers have adopted the routine use of prophylactic&#xD;
      postoperative antibiotics to reduce the risk of CIED infections. However, neither of these&#xD;
      strategies has been evaluated in randomized clinical studies. Antibacterial irrigation&#xD;
      solution is expensive, and oral antibiotics are associated with a small yet clinically&#xD;
      important risk of adverse effects, including Clostridium difficile infection. Therefore,&#xD;
      prospective randomized studies are needed to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness of intraoperative antibacterial rinse and postoperative oral antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summary of significance: CIED infections constitute major complications of device&#xD;
      implantations or revisions and are becoming increasingly prevalent. Infections are associated&#xD;
      with increased morbidity, mortality, and cost, and are very difficult to treat. Recent&#xD;
      studies have explored ways to reduce the incidence of CIED infections, and use of the TYRX&#xD;
      antibacterial envelope has emerged as a potential strategy for prevention. Other strategies&#xD;
      including intraoperative antibacterial irrigation and postoperative oral antibiotics are&#xD;
      commonly used despite the lack of prospective studies documenting efficacy, safety, and&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness. We and others have reported a very low incidence (&lt;1%) of CIED infections&#xD;
      in high-risk patients receiving the TYRX antibacterial envelope. One intriguing possibility&#xD;
      is that the antibacterial envelope can be used instead of intraoperative antibacterial rinse&#xD;
      and postoperative oral antibiotics. Therefore, an important knowledge gap exists about the&#xD;
      best practices to prevent CIED infections in high-risk individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.0 Rationale and Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM: to test the hypothesis that the use of the TYRX antibacterial envelope alone is&#xD;
      noninferior to a strategy using the antibacterial envelope and intraoperative antibacterial&#xD;
      irrigant and postoperative oral antibiotics for the reduction of cardiac implantable device&#xD;
      infections in patients with ≥2 risk factors for infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CIED infections are devastating yet potentially preventable complications. We previously&#xD;
      conducted a retrospective study of the TYRX antibacterial envelope and found that use of the&#xD;
      device in patients with ≥2 risk factors for CIED infection was associated with a markedly&#xD;
      decreased infection rate (0.4% with the device versus 3% without, adjusted odds ratio [95%&#xD;
      confidence interval]: 0.09 [0.01 to 0.73], P =0.02). All patients in our previous study had&#xD;
      intraoperative irrigation of the device pocket with polymyxin-B/bacitracin solution and&#xD;
      received routine postoperative oral antibiotics consistent with local practices. However,&#xD;
      whether use of intraoperative irrigant and postoperative antibiotics reduces the risk of&#xD;
      infection has not been evaluated in prospective, randomized trials. Moreover, it is unknown&#xD;
      whether these treatments offer any incremental benefit over the use of the TYRX antibacterial&#xD;
      envelope alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the significant cost of polymyxin-B/bacitracin solution and concerns over unnecessary&#xD;
      use of oral antibiotics and emerging resistant microorganisms, it is critically important to&#xD;
      establish whether these treatments offer any incremental benefit for patients at high risk&#xD;
      for a CIED infection who are receiving the TYRX antibacterial envelope. The Specific Aim of&#xD;
      this study will be to prospectively test the hypothesis that an infection risk-reduction&#xD;
      strategy using the TYRX antibacterial envelope alone is noninferior to a strategy using the&#xD;
      envelope with intraoperative antibacterial irrigant and postoperative oral antibiotics in&#xD;
      patients undergoing a CIED procedure who have at least 2 CIED infection risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.0 Previous Animal and Human Studies&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TYRX antibacterial envelope effectively prevented CIED infections in an animal model. In&#xD;
      an animal model of direct bacterial inoculation into the device pocket, the TYRX&#xD;
      antibacterial envelope showed excellent activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis,&#xD;
      Staphylococcus capitis, Escherichia coli, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Importantly, systemic&#xD;
      levels of minocycline and rifampin were undetectable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the TYRX antibacterial envelope has been associated with a reduced incidence of CIED&#xD;
      infections in retrospective studies of high-risk patients. In a multi-center trial, use of&#xD;
      the TYRX antibacterial envelope was associated with a low risk of CIED infections (0.5%).&#xD;
      However, the relatively short follow-up period (mean: 1.9 months) and lack of a control arm&#xD;
      limited the interpretation of the study's results. We conducted a retrospective controlled&#xD;
      study of the TYRX antibacterial envelope in patients with at least 2 CIED infection risk&#xD;
      factors at our institution. Among 260 TYRX envelope recipients, the incidence of CIED&#xD;
      infection after a mean 18.7 month follow-up period was 0.4%, compared with 3% in 639&#xD;
      high-risk controls who did not receive the envelope (adjusted odds ratio: 0.09, 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval 0.01 to 0.73, P =0.02). Another retrospective study at a high-volume&#xD;
      center found that the prevalence of CIED infections decreased from 1.5% to 0.6% after the&#xD;
      TYRX antibacterial envelope was instituted into practice (P =0.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on these and other studies, the Worldwide Randomized Antibiotic Envelope CIED Infection&#xD;
      Prevention Trial (WRAP-IT) was conceived. This landmark trial will prospectively evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of the TYRX-A antibacterial envelope. However, our proposed study will be&#xD;
      complementary to the WRAP-IT trial because we will specifically evaluate whether the TYRX-A&#xD;
      antibacterial envelope alone offers ample protection against CIED infections without the use&#xD;
      of intraoperative antibacterial solution and postoperative oral antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.0 Study Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device implantation and follow-up. CIED procedures will be performed in accordance with&#xD;
      established practice guidelines. Perioperative procedures to reduce the risk of CIED&#xD;
      infection including optimal skin preparation and intravenous antibiotics (cefazolin or&#xD;
      vancomycin) will be applied to all patients. All patients will receive the TYRX absorbable&#xD;
      antibacterial envelope. Patients randomized to the intraoperative antibacterial&#xD;
      irrigant/postoperative oral antibiotic (control) arm will undergo irrigation of the device&#xD;
      pocket with up to 1 liter polymyxin-B/bacitracin solution. Patients in the control arm will&#xD;
      also receive 3 days of postoperative oral antibiotics (cephalexin 500mg 3 times daily,&#xD;
      clindamycin 300mg 3 times daily, or levofloxacin 500mg once daily) as per investigator&#xD;
      routine ordering practice with discretion per each individual patient. Patients randomized to&#xD;
      the experimental arm will not receive intraoperative antibacterial irrigation (will be&#xD;
      allowed up to 1 liter sterile saline irrigation), nor post-operative oral antibiotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be followed after their procedures according to established practice&#xD;
      guidelines. At a minimum, patients will be seen 4 weeks after the procedure for a wound&#xD;
      check, at 6 months, and then every year or more frequently as dictated by each patient's&#xD;
      clinical status. A digital photograph of the device pocket will be captured at the 4-week&#xD;
      postoperative visit. In addition, the study nurse will telephone each patient 3 months after&#xD;
      implantation to assess for symptoms and signs of infection. For the purposes of the study,&#xD;
      patients will continue to be followed for a minimum of 6 months after the procedure, but&#xD;
      additional follow-up data after six months may be collected continuously until the study&#xD;
      closes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ascertainment of the primary endpoint: CIED infection after a minimum 6-month follow-up&#xD;
      period. The primary study endpoint will be CIED infection resulting in complete CIED system&#xD;
      removal, antibiotic therapy in patients who are not candidates for system removal, or death&#xD;
      due to CIED infection. To avoid detection bias we will prospectively apply criteria for&#xD;
      definition of the primary endpoint and ask treating physicians to thoroughly document&#xD;
      objective findings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Examples of objective signs of CIED infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective findings of CIED infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fever or leukocytosis without an alternative explanation (e.g., urinary tract infection&#xD;
           or pneumonia)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tenderness, erythema, or warmth at the pulse generator site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purulent discharge from the pulse generator site (from incision or fistula)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Positive blood or pulse generator site cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vegetation adherent to CIED hardware&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purulent material within pulse generator pocket upon reoperation&#xD;
&#xD;
      A digital photograph of the device pocket will be captured routinely at the postoperative&#xD;
      visit and whenever CIED infection is a consideration. In case of a suspected CIED infection,&#xD;
      treating physicians will be strongly encouraged to obtain peripheral blood cultures prior to&#xD;
      initiation of antibiotic therapy and intraoperative cultures during CIED system removal. A&#xD;
      panel of 3 physicians at the coordinating center who are blinded to study assignment&#xD;
      (experimental versus control) will independently adjudicate outcomes in &quot;real time&quot; and will&#xD;
      vote whether or not the criteria for CIED infection have been met. A minor superficial&#xD;
      infection of the incision that does not involve the generator pocket, does not result in any&#xD;
      systemic symptoms or signs, and is treated with either observation or a short course of oral&#xD;
      antibiotics, will not be counted as a CIED infection but will be considered a secondary&#xD;
      endpoint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study oversight: The principal investigator at each study sight will be responsible for all&#xD;
      aspects of the study at their respective sites. To ensure fidelity with the study protocol,&#xD;
      an independent study coordinator at Vanderbilt University who is not directly involved with&#xD;
      the study will review upon initiation of the study and first patient enrolled at each site,&#xD;
      and then a random selection (10%) of patient records at each site (including Vanderbilt&#xD;
      University) on a continuous basis set out by the monitoring agreement throughout the duration&#xD;
      of the study, and quarterly prepare a report for the study's principal investigator.&#xD;
