  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 open label, single dose, 5 parallel-group study in which a single 400 mg&#xD;
      dose of pacritinib will be administered orally to patients with renal impairment (mild,&#xD;
      moderate, severe, and patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis) and sex-, age- and&#xD;
      weight-matched healthy subjects.Patients with ESRD will receive a single 400 mg dose of&#xD;
      pacritinib during 2 different treatment periods: Dialysis and Inter-Dialysis. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and safety of pacritinib in renal&#xD;
      impairment.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Groups 1, 2, and 3 will consist of 8 patients each with mild, moderate, or severe renal&#xD;
      disease, respectively, based on their estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated&#xD;
      by the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease [MDRD] study equation). Each of these patients&#xD;
      will receive a single 400 mg dose of pacritinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 4 will consist of 8 patients with ESRD requiring hemodialysis who have been on a stable&#xD;
      dialysis regimen for at least 6 months. In this cohort only, patients will participate in 2&#xD;
      treatment periods, Dialysis and Inter-Dialysis, separated by a 14-day period between&#xD;
      pacritinib administration. In the Dialysis Treatment Period, a single 400 mg dose of&#xD;
      pacritinib will be administered 4 hours prior to each patient's normally scheduled&#xD;
      hemodialysis. In the Inter-Dialysis Treatment Period, a single 400 mg dose of pacritinib will&#xD;
      be administered immediately after the end of the patient's normally scheduled hemodialysis&#xD;
      session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 5 will consist of 8 healthy subjects enrolled to match the sex-, age-, and weight of&#xD;
      the patients with mild, moderate, and severe renal impairment and patients with ESRD enrolled&#xD;
      in the study. Healthy subjects will be administered a single 400 mg dose of pacritinib.&#xD;
