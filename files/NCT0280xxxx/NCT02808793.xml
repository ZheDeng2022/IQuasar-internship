        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provided written informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female aged ≥18 and ≤65 years at the time of signing the informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Confirmed diagnosis of ISM based on World Health Organization (WHO) criteria (Appendix&#xD;
             1)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of at least 1 of the following SM related symptoms:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Flushing (at least 1 episode per week)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Pruritus (minimum MAS2 score of 4) (Appendix 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Diarrhea (minimum MAS2 score of 4) (Appendix 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Anaphylaxis (at least 1 episode [grade 2 or higher] within the last 12 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Serum total tryptase exceeded 15 ng/mL* at 2 or more measurements obtained 1 or more&#xD;
             months apart within the last 2 years (*Note: this varies from the minor criterion of&#xD;
             &quot;persistently exceeds 20 ng/mL&quot; in the WHO criteria for diagnosis of ISM)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Willing and able to comply with the study procedures and visit schedule, including&#xD;
             follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Able to communicate effectively with the study site personnel&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Negative Screening urine drug tests (alcohol, amphetamines/methamphetamines,&#xD;
             barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cannabinoids, cocaine, cotinine, methadone,&#xD;
             methaqualone, opiates, phencyclidine)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Negative Screening ova and parasite test&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Determined by the Investigator to be in good health as documented by the medical&#xD;
             history, physical examination (PE), vital sign assessments, 12- lead ECG, clinical&#xD;
             laboratory assessments, and by general observations&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Women of child bearing potential, must be using highly effective methods of birth&#xD;
             control (failure rate &lt;1% per year when used consistently and correctly) at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to Screening until Day 85. Women should be informed of the potential risks&#xD;
             associated with becoming pregnant while enrolled. Accepted forms of contraception are&#xD;
             implants, injectables, combined oral contraceptives, and some intrauterine devices&#xD;
             (IUDs). In addition, a barrier method must always be used concomitantly to the highly&#xD;
             effective method. Double-barrier is not considered a highly effective method. Periodic&#xD;
             abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, post-ovulation methods) is not&#xD;
             an acceptable means of contraception. Female patients are considered to not be of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential when they are post-menopausal for at least 2 years with&#xD;
             follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) levels &gt;40 mIU/mL, are surgically sterilized, or&#xD;
             have undergone hysterectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Male patients with female partners of childbearing potential must agree to use a&#xD;
             condom without spermicide during sexual activity with female partners of childbearing&#xD;
             potential. Female sexual partners of male patients must be willing to avoid pregnancy&#xD;
             according to the above described methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Known hypersensitivity to any constituent of the study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of an associated hematologic non-mast-cell lineage disorder or MC leukemia&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Any disease or condition (medical or surgical) which, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             Investigator, might compromise the hematologic, cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal,&#xD;
             gastrointestinal, hepatic, skeletal, or central nervous system; or other conditions&#xD;
             that may interfere with the absorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of&#xD;
             AK002, or would place the patient at increased risk&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. The presence of abnormal laboratory values considered to be clinically significant by&#xD;
             the Investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participation in a concurrent interventional study with the last intervention&#xD;
             occurring within 30 days prior to administration of study drug (90 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives, whichever is longer, for biologic products)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Treatment with chemotherapy or radiotherapy in the preceding 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Treatment for a clinically significant helminthic parasitic infection within 6 months&#xD;
             of screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Use during the 7 days before Screening (or 5 half-lives, whichever is longer) or&#xD;
             expected to require the use of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors or beta&#xD;
             blockers&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use during the 30 days before Screening (or 5 half lives, whichever is longer) or&#xD;
             expected to require the use of omalizumab, immunosuppressive drugs, or systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids with a daily dose &gt;10 mg prednisone or equivalent&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Vaccination with live attenuated vaccines within 30 days prior to initiation of&#xD;
             treatment in the study, during the treatment period, or vaccination expected within 5&#xD;
             half-lives (4 months) of the study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Donation or loss of &gt;500 mL of blood within 56 days prior to administration of study&#xD;
             drug or donation of plasma within 7 days prior to administration of study drug&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Has not refrained from excessive caffeine consumption (&gt;3 cups of coffee per day or&#xD;
             equivalent) for 48 hours prior to study drug administration and agreed to this do so&#xD;
             throughout the inpatient period&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Positive hepatitis serology results, except for vaccinated patients or patients with&#xD;
             past but resolved hepatitis, at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Positive HIV serology results at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Any other reason that in the opinion of the Investigator or the Medical Monitor makes&#xD;
             the patient unsuitable for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Patient is vulnerable (e.g., patient kept in detention)&#xD;
