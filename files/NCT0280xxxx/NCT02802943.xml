      multi-peptide vaccination with a patient-individualized peptide cocktail.&#xD;

      Study Duration and Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of the trial for each subject is expected to be 24 months. The duration for each&#xD;
      individual patient includes about 6 months first-line therapy according to treating&#xD;
      physicians choice with HLA ligandome analyses of CLL cells and selection of&#xD;
      patient-individual multipeptide vaccine being performed in parallel, 12 months study&#xD;
      treatment and 6 months followup time. The overall duration of the trial is expected to be&#xD;
      approximately 4 years. Recruitment of subjects will start in 09/2016. The actual overall&#xD;
      duration or recruitment may vary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Criteria for Subject Selection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the screening procedures of this study, physically fit subjects (as defined by ECOG score&#xD;
      ≤2) with a confirmed diagnosis of a CLL/SLL according to the IWCLL guidelines requiring&#xD;
      treatment are eligible. First line treatment will be performed according to treating&#xD;
      physicians choice. The trial population will consist of both genders. Gender distribution in&#xD;
      the trial is supposed to reflect the distribution in the real patient's population (approx.&#xD;
      60% male and 40% female patients), i.e. there will be no prior defined quantitative ratio&#xD;
      between females and males. To assure that the included patients have the ability to mount an&#xD;
      immune response, immune response to an HLA matched EBV/CMV peptide mix will be assessed in&#xD;
      the screening phase. 60ml blood will be taken at the screening study visit. Peripheral&#xD;
      mononuclear cells will be isolated and analyzed in a 12 day IFNγ ELISPOT for memory Tcell&#xD;
      response to an EBV/CMV peptide mix. Only patients showing a positive immune response (section&#xD;
      8.1.1) will be eligible to receive the study drugs after first line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the study treatment, physically fit subjects (as defined by ECOG score ≤2) with a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of CLL according to the IWCLL guidelines, which were treated with a first&#xD;
      line therapy according to physicians choice are eligible. Subjects must have achieved at&#xD;
      least a PR (IWCLL guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of CLL) after treatment with&#xD;
      first line therapy.The end of study is determined as the date of the last visit of the last&#xD;
      patient (LSO 04/2020).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional, open-label, multi-center phase II trial with use of a patient-individualized&#xD;
      multipeptide vaccine and imiquimod as adjuvant&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No blinding will be performed to avoid unnecessary complications of intradermal injections&#xD;
      with sodium acid solution. Method against bias in patient selection: The patient selection&#xD;
      will be documented. Reasons for refusal will be assessed.Method against bias in treatment&#xD;
      manualized treatment protocol, monitoring and treatment reports. Method against bias in data&#xD;
      analysis: Monitoring, analysis by intention to treat; independent statistician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic lymphatic leukaemia-peptide vaccine (CLL-VAC) drug product (DP):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient enrolled in the iVAC-CLL01 trial will receive a CLL-VAC DP specifically tailored&#xD;
      to the individual HLA ligandome of his/her respective CLL cells. The DPs are composed of&#xD;
      peptides that are first manufactured as drug substances. A process named CLL-VAC_v1 enables&#xD;
      the selection of drug substances to compose the unique, patient individual CLL-VAC DPs.&#xD;
      CLL-VAC DPs will be composed based on a peptide warehouse consisting of 40 individual&#xD;
      peptides (drug substances; 30 HLA class I peptides (5 A*01, 5 A*02, 5 A*03, 5 A*24, 5 B*07, 5&#xD;
      B*08) and 4 HLA class II peptides. All HLA class I peptides and HLA class II peptides are&#xD;
      shown to be immunogenic. For each patient 5 HLA class I peptides are selected from the&#xD;
      warehouse based on patient individual HLA ligandome analysis of CLL cells and are&#xD;
      subsequently formulated into the personalized drug; the 4 HLA class II peptides will be&#xD;
      included in each peptide vaccine cocktail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All warehouse peptides are manufactured by BCN PEPTIDES, S.A, Els Vinyets-Els Fogars II,&#xD;
      08777 Sant Quintí de Mediona (Barcelona), Spain, or by Wirkstoffpeptidlabor, University of&#xD;
      Tübingen, Auf der Morgenstelle 15, 72076 Tübingen, Germany. Both production sites hold&#xD;
      certificates for the production of GMP grade synthetic peptides. All peptides are synthetic&#xD;
      peptides, which will be manufactured by well-established solid phase peptide synthesis (SPPS)&#xD;
      procedures using Fmoc chemistry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aldara® (imiquimod) Cream, 5%, is supplied as in single-use packets (24 per box), each of&#xD;
      which contains 250 mg of the cream, equivalent to 12.5 mg of imiquimod. Aldara® (Meda GmbH)&#xD;
      is a standard good of release.&#xD;

Analysis of the primary endpoint= induction of immune response:&#xD;
The induction of peptide-specific T cell responses will be determined by IFNγ ELISPOT.&#xD;
T cell responses will be considered to be positive when &gt;15 spots/well (IFNγ ELISPOT) were counted and the mean spot count per well is at least 3-fold higher than the mean number of spots in the negative control wells (according to the cancer immunoguiding program guidelines).</description>

    <description>Individualized multi-peptide cocktail consisting of 300 μg each of 5 HLA class I and 4 HLA class II restricted peptides. The peptides for each individual patient will be selected from a warehouse consisting of 30 different peptides restricted by the 6 most common HLA class I allotypes (A*01, A*02, A*03, A*24, B*07, B*08) and 4 HLA class II peptides. Peptides will be administered subcutaneously. Vaccination will take place on d1, d4, d8, d15, d22 followed by vaccinations every 4 weeks for 1 year.
