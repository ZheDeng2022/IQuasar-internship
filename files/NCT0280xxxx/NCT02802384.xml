  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Paget's disease of the bone is a skeletal disorder which results in increased and&#xD;
      disorganized bone remodeling, leading to dense but fragile and expanding bones. The&#xD;
      identified genetic causes of Paget's disease of bone only explain why bone is destroyed, but&#xD;
      not why the bone formed in its place is abnormal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment for people with Paget's disease of the bone is limited to patients with&#xD;
      bone pain, thought to be related to high rate of bone turnover (breakdown and rebuilding of&#xD;
      bone) and works by slowing down the rate of bone breakdown. The current treatment does not&#xD;
      address the excess blood vessels and bone formed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done to understand factors that may promote blood vessel and bone&#xD;
      formation in Paget's disease of the bone.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The genetic mutations found in Paget's disease currently only account for about 15% of cases&#xD;
      and are limited to genes that affect osteoclast differentiation and function. These mutations&#xD;
      alone are insufficient to explain the full phenotype, particularly hypervascularity and&#xD;
      increased bone formation. Through a series of basic science studies, the investigators have&#xD;
      recently found that preosteoclasts secrete chemokines to promote migration of various stem&#xD;
      cells, which then differentiate into osteoblasts and endothelial cells to support&#xD;
      osteogenesis and angiogenesis, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform a cross sectional study of patients with active Paget's&#xD;
      disease of bone compared to similar people without Paget's disease of bone. The goal is to&#xD;
      enroll 10 patients with Paget's disease of the bone (cases) and 10 healthy, age- and&#xD;
      sex-matched people (controls) whom meet similar exclusion criteria. Participants who consent&#xD;
      to the study will undergo a brief history and physical exam, allow review of medical records&#xD;
      relevant to their disease, and have one blood (5 tablespoons) sample drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that specific chemokine concentrations are increased in people&#xD;
      with Paget's disease of the bone compared to controls. The investigators also hypothesize&#xD;
      that these levels correlate with severity of disease. Therefore, the investigators primary&#xD;
      objective is to determine if serum chemokine levels are increased in patients with Paget's&#xD;
      disease of the bone. The secondary objective is to evaluate if the serum chemokine&#xD;
      concentrations correlate with various markers of disease activity. Findings could aid in the&#xD;
      clinical monitoring of patients with Paget's disease of the bone and could provide an&#xD;
      additional therapeutic target to improve treatment of this painful disease.&#xD;
