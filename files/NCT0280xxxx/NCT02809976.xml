  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if topical ruxolitinib 1.5% will provide&#xD;
      repigmentation in vitiligo lesions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis is that JAK inhibitors can also successfully treat vitiligo. Lesional skin of&#xD;
      both alopecia areata and vitiligo primarily contain T cells in a TH1 response as opposed to a&#xD;
      mixed cell infiltrate such as in psoriasis or lichen planus. Both alopecia areata and&#xD;
      vitiligo are TH1 mediated diseases dependent on the production of IFN-gamma to drive the&#xD;
      response. CD8+ T cells are both necessary and sufficient for melanocyte destruction in&#xD;
      vitiligo (van den Boorn JG et al 2009) and CD8+NKG2D+ T cells are also necessary and&#xD;
      sufficient for hair loss in alopecia areata (Gilhar A et al 2013).&#xD;

    <measure>Percent Change in Vitiligo Area Severity Index (VASI) Score From Baseline to Week 20</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>The VASI for each body region (hands, upper extremities, trunk, lower extremities, feet) is determined by the product of the area involved in hand prints and the extent of depigmentation within each hand print unit measured patch (0-100). Area involved is measured by hand prints (1 hand print = 1%) with a possible range of 0-100. Degree of depigmentation is measured as: 1.00 (100%) = complete depigmentation, no pigment present, 0.90(90%)=specks of pigment present, 0.75(75%)=depigmented area exceeds the pigmented area, 0.50(50%)=pigmented and depigmented areas are equal, 0.25(25%)=pigmented area exceeds depigmented area, 0.10(10%)=only specks of depigmentation present, and 0.0(0%)=no depigmentation present.</description>

    <measure>Percent Change in Vitiligo European Task Force (VETF) Assessment - Body Surface Area</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>Vitiligo European Task Force assessment consisted of three components: Extent of disease reflecting the body surface area (0-100%), disease staging (0-20), and disease progression (-5 +5). Staging is based on cutaneous and hair pigmentation assessing the largest patch in each body area (head/neck, trunk, arms, legs, and hands/feet); Stage 0=normal pigmentation, Stage 1=incomplete pigmentation, Stage 2=complete depigmentation, Stage 3= partial hair whitening (&lt;30%), Stage 4= complete hair whitening. Disease progression is based on assessing the largest patch in each body area; Score 0= similar limits, Score 1= progressive vitiligo (ongoing subclinical depigmentation), Score -1= regressive vitiligo (ongoing subclinical repigmentation). Where a higher number indicates more severe disease spread and a negative number indicates improving disease. These three subsets are evaluated and reported independently and not mutually related to each other.</description>

    <measure>Mean Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) Scores</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Week 20</time_frame>
    <description>DLQI is calculated by summing the score of each question resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired. The percent change was calculated from the mean DLQI at baseline and week 20</description>

        <description>The VASI for each body region (hands, upper extremities, trunk, lower extremities, feet) is determined by the product of the area involved in hand prints and the extent of depigmentation within each hand print unit measured patch (0-100). Area involved is measured by hand prints (1 hand print = 1%) with a possible range of 0-100. Degree of depigmentation is measured as: 1.00 (100%) = complete depigmentation, no pigment present, 0.90(90%)=specks of pigment present, 0.75(75%)=depigmented area exceeds the pigmented area, 0.50(50%)=pigmented and depigmented areas are equal, 0.25(25%)=pigmented area exceeds depigmented area, 0.10(10%)=only specks of depigmentation present, and 0.0(0%)=no depigmentation present.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Vitiligo European Task Force (VETF) Assessment - Body Surface Area</title>
        <description>Vitiligo European Task Force assessment consisted of three components: Extent of disease reflecting the body surface area (0-100%), disease staging (0-20), and disease progression (-5 +5). Staging is based on cutaneous and hair pigmentation assessing the largest patch in each body area (head/neck, trunk, arms, legs, and hands/feet); Stage 0=normal pigmentation, Stage 1=incomplete pigmentation, Stage 2=complete depigmentation, Stage 3= partial hair whitening (&lt;30%), Stage 4= complete hair whitening. Disease progression is based on assessing the largest patch in each body area; Score 0= similar limits, Score 1= progressive vitiligo (ongoing subclinical depigmentation), Score -1= regressive vitiligo (ongoing subclinical repigmentation). Where a higher number indicates more severe disease spread and a negative number indicates improving disease. These three subsets are evaluated and reported independently and not mutually related to each other.</description>

        <title>Percent Change in Vitiligo European Task Force (VETF) Assessment - Disease Progression</title>
        <description>Vitiligo European Task Force assessment consisted of three components: Extent of disease reflecting the body surface area (0-100%), disease staging (0-20), and disease progression (-5 +5). Staging is based on cutaneous and hair pigmentation assessing the largest patch in each body area (head/neck, trunk, arms, legs, and hands/feet); Stage 0=normal pigmentation, Stage 1=incomplete pigmentation, Stage 2=complete depigmentation, Stage 3= partial hair whitening (&lt;30%), Stage 4= complete hair whitening. Disease progression is based on assessing the largest patch in each body area; Score 0= similar limits, Score 1= progressive vitiligo (ongoing subclinical depigmentation), Score -1= regressive vitiligo (ongoing subclinical repigmentation). Where a higher number indicates more severe disease spread and a negative number indicates improving disease. These three subsets are evaluated and reported independently and not mutually related to each other.</description>
