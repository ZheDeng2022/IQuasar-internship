  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Upon penicillins' introduction, inactivation of beta- lactam antibiotics by enzymes produced&#xD;
      by bacteria was demonstrated. Until recently, carbapenems were a relatively spared subclass&#xD;
      by these enzymes which makes the molecules of last resort in serious infection. Recently the&#xD;
      prevalence of enzymes hydrolysing carbapenem, the carbapenemases, was increasing in some&#xD;
      countries. But these carbapenemases are not the only mechanism involved in a decreased&#xD;
      susceptibility to carbapenems which is sometimes linked to the conjunction of several&#xD;
      resistance mechanisms. Data available on the epidemic situation of this new resistance are&#xD;
      essential for improving their detection, the management of infections in patients and prevent&#xD;
      the occurrence of epidemic. In this context, the investigators propose a study in the&#xD;
      North-East inter-region to estimate the prevalence of Enterobacteriaceae with decrease&#xD;
      susceptibility to carbapenems and look for risk factors for infection with this type of&#xD;
      bacteria. The study is conducted in five teaching hospitals (Besançon, Dijon, Nancy, Reims&#xD;
      and Strasbourg) and two general hospitals (Colmar and Troyes) in North-Eastern France. For&#xD;
      one year, all the Enterobacteriaceae isolates with a decreased susceptibility to carbapenems&#xD;
      (CDSE) according to the 2012 Antibiogram Comity of the French Microbiology Society (CA-SFM)&#xD;
      (MIC of ertapenem &gt; 0.5 μg/mL) are collected and sent to the bacteriology laboratory of the&#xD;
      Reims University Hospital. Among these strains 105 are randomly selected. The clinical study&#xD;
      is conducted as follow: for each patient with CDSE isolate included in a center, 2 control&#xD;
      patients are selected. They are the patients having the 2 Enterobacteriaceae isolates, with&#xD;
      no reduced susceptibility to carbapenems and following the CDSE isolate in the same center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbiological study : identification of isolates is performed using MALDI-TOF (Bruker&#xD;
      Daltonics, Bremen, Germany). Antibiotic susceptibilities is determined by the disc diffusion&#xD;
      method according to European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing (EUCAST)&#xD;
      guidelines (www.EUCAST.org) and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBLs) are detected by the&#xD;
      double-disc synergy test and carbapenem minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs to Imipenem,&#xD;
      Ertapenem, Doripenem and Meropenem) determined using E-test® strips. Metallo-β-lactamase&#xD;
      production was screened with the MβL Etest (bioMérieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France).&#xD;
      Beta-lactamases detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Carbapenemase-encoding genes&#xD;
      (blaKPC, blaVIM, blaIMP, blaNDM, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-24-like, blaOXA-58-like and&#xD;
      blaOXA-48-like) were screened using multiplex PCRs and blaIMI and blaGES with simplex PCRs.&#xD;
      All the blaOXA-48-like detected were subsequently sequenced. Genes blaTEM, blaSHV, blaCTX-M&#xD;
      and blaOXA were detected by PCR using specific primers. Plasmid-mediated AmpC-type genes&#xD;
      blaACC, blaFOX, blaMOX, blaDHA, blaCMY and blaMIR were screened using multiplex PCRs. All the&#xD;
      beta-lactamases are sequenced. Mutations in the quinolone resistance determining region&#xD;
      (QRDR) are identified by PCR and sequencing in the gyrA, gyrB, parC and parE genes. Qnr and&#xD;
      qepA genes are detected by real-time PCR, aac(6')-Ib-cr by pyrosequencing and oqxAB by&#xD;
      conventional PCR. Genotyping is performed with pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and&#xD;
      multilocus sequence typing (MLST).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis : qualitative variables are analysed with the Chi2 test and the&#xD;
      two-tailed Fisher exact test. Quantitative variables are compared using the Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test. Then, a multivariate analysis is conducted: logistic regression with stepwise factors&#xD;
      as explanatory variables with p &lt;0.20 in the univariate analysis as input threshold and&#xD;
      output set at 0.20.The results are considered statistically significant when P &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected results : this study will give the proportion of the different species involved, of&#xD;
      the carbapenemase in comparison to the other mechanisms, the level of resistance in MIC. Risk&#xD;
      factors such as previous antibiotic treatment, underlying disease severity or clonal strain&#xD;
      transmission will be evidenced, allowing to identify prevention control measure to implement.&#xD;
