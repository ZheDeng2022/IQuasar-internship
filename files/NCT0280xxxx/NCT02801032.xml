      In a double blind placebo-controlled cross-over study the effect of tadalafil on blood flow&#xD;
      velocity in the large arteries of the brain, cortical brain oxygenation, peripheral&#xD;
      endothelial function, and endothelial biomarkers will be tested in patients with lacunar&#xD;
      stroke caused by cerebral small vessel disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Stroke frequently causes death and decreased function in the everyday life, and the disease&#xD;
      has a great human and economic impact. Cerebral small vessel disease (SVD) is the underlying&#xD;
      cause of 25 % of all ischemic cerebral strokes and it can further lead to vascular cognitive&#xD;
      impairment (VCI), disability and in some cases vascular dementia (VaD). It is well known that&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow (CBF) is reduced in VCI. To be able to improve the blood flow in the&#xD;
      vasculature of white and gray matter is therefore desirable in slowing the pathology of VCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The nitric oxide-cGMP vasodilator pathways has been shown to be impaired in endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction which is seen in SVD.This study targets this well-established mechanism of action&#xD;
      by use of a compound selectively inhibiting the breakdown of cGMP, the PDE5 inhibitor&#xD;
      tadalafil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall hypothesis is that chronic PDE5 inhibition with tadalafil will lessen the&#xD;
      severity and progression of vascular brain lesions via augmentation of cerebral blood flow in&#xD;
      the deep brain areas. The specific primary hypothesis for the current project is that PDE5&#xD;
      inhibition with a single dose of tadalafil (Cialis®) will, in contrast to placebo,&#xD;
      temporarily change the blood flow in the large blood vessels in the brain and change cortical&#xD;
      brain oxygenation in patients with cerebral small vessel disease measured with Transcranial&#xD;
      Doppler and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). The secondary hypothesis is that tadalafil&#xD;
      will improve the peripheral endothelial function measured as improved blood vessel response&#xD;
      in the fingers after a brief occlusion of the arm's blood supply measured with EndoPAT2000.&#xD;
      In addition there will be a change of endothelial function biomarkers in the blood after a&#xD;
      single dose of tadalafil, and these changes are consistent with the measured peripheral and&#xD;
      central blood vessel function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In regulation of cerebral artery flow and neuronal signalling nitric oxide (NO) and cGMP act&#xD;
      as key molecules. In animal models, selective inhibitors of the cGMP degrading PDE5,&#xD;
      sildenafil and tadalafil, have been reported to improve the associated symptoms of&#xD;
      endothelial dysfunction and stroke recovery. Pre-clinical studies support a CBF-enhancing&#xD;
      action of PDE5 inhibitors in cerebrovascular disease while human studies to date have been&#xD;
      limited to sildenafil and have not specifically addressed effects on CBF in people with SVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tadalafil (Cialis®; Eli Lilly) is widely prescribed for erectile dysfunction in men. It is&#xD;
      also registered for regular daily use at a dose of 40 mg for pulmonary hypertension and 5 mg&#xD;
      for benign prostatic hyperplasia. The side effects of tadalafil is well-known and the&#xD;
      medicine is usually well tolerated. Tadalafil was chosen over other PDE5 inhibitors (such as&#xD;
      sildenafil, Viagra®) due to it's potency, plasma half-life, selectivity for PDE5, and&#xD;
      documented brain penetration.&#xD;
