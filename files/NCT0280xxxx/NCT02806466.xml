      -  Background: Asthma is a frequent disease characterized by bronchial hyperresponsiveness,&#xD;
           inflammation and remodeling. Consistent epidemiological data indicate that outcome of&#xD;
           asthma in adults may be determined in early childhood. This may be due to bronchial&#xD;
           remodeling, an abnormal repair process that contributes to the development of poorly&#xD;
           reversible airway narrowing. It appears very early in the natural history of the disease&#xD;
           and involves increased mass of bronchial smooth muscle (BSM). The mechanism of such an&#xD;
           increase has been related with an increase in smooth muscle cell proliferation.&#xD;
           Recently, we have demonstrated that in severe asthma, BSM increased proliferation is&#xD;
           induced by an enhanced mitochondrial biogenesis. Moreover, we have also shown that&#xD;
           immature human, non-asthmatic airway smooth muscle cells (ASMC) proliferate to a greater&#xD;
           extent than normal adult ASMC, in a similar fashion to adult asthmatic ASMC. Immature&#xD;
           ASMC may thus have great potential to stimulate airway remodeling. We thus hypothesized&#xD;
           that remodeling is an early process and certain characteristics of ASMC in severe&#xD;
           preschool asthma may predispose such children to persistent remodeling with airway&#xD;
           obstruction later in life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Purpose: To investigate prognostic factors of airway remodeling in preschool children,&#xD;
           with special attention to ASMC proliferation (mitochondrial mass &amp; biogenesis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Methods: In the initial phase of the project, 75 severe asthmatic preschool children (&lt;5&#xD;
           yr) will be prospectively recruited from the &quot;CHU de Bordeaux&quot; and the &quot;CHU de Toulouse&quot;&#xD;
           according to the &quot;Haute Autorité de Santé&quot; criteria. Inclusion visit will include&#xD;
           written informed consent, asthma control evaluation, clinical examination, lung function&#xD;
           testing (exhaled NO, plethysmography), prick tests, chest X Ray and blood sample for&#xD;
           total IgE levels. Bronchial specimens from all subjects will be obtained by fiberoptic&#xD;
           bronchoscopy at visit 2. Airway remodeling will be evaluated by morphological analysis.&#xD;
           After smooth muscle mitochondria will be analyzed by electronic microscopy &amp;&#xD;
           immunoblotting. Comparison between the 2 groups will be performed by unpaired t tests&#xD;
           for parametric data and x2-tests for non-parametric data. In the second phase of the&#xD;
           project, patients will then be followed-up till the age of 7-10 yrs, when another&#xD;
           bronchoscopy with biopsies will be performed.&#xD;
