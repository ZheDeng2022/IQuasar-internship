  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The management of distal radius fractures has been in a state of evolution over the past 30&#xD;
      years. Treatment has become increasingly focused on obtaining a stable, internal construct&#xD;
      for quick return to normal, daily activities. With the advent of volar locking plates, the&#xD;
      wrist fracture is stable before the patient leaves the operating room. As surgical plate and&#xD;
      screw constructs become more stable, the need for casting and splinting may be less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presumptive &quot;next step&quot; in operative management of distal radius fractures is to do away&#xD;
      with the postoperative splint. A review of the available English language literature failed&#xD;
      to reveal any studies evaluating the use of postoperative splinting and patient outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, randomized study was designed to investigate the use of temporary plaster&#xD;
      splints versus removable over-the-counter splits versus soft dressings for post-operative&#xD;
      treatment of extra-articular and intra-articular distal radius fractures. The patients will&#xD;
      be followed for 12 months evaluating maintenance of fracture reduction and patient outcomes.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A prospective study using multiple surgeons at multiple centers (Community Regional Medical&#xD;
      Center and Sierra Pacific Orthopaedic Center) investigating post-operative management of&#xD;
      extra and intra articular distal radius fractures treated with volar locking plates.&#xD;
      Post-operative management for 2 weeks immediately following surgery will consist of placing&#xD;
      1/3 of patients in a short arm, custom-made, plaster splint, 1/3 with a removable Velcro&#xD;
      wrist splint, and 1/3 with a soft dressing. The Velcro wrist brace group will be asked to&#xD;
      wear the brace as much as possible during the two weeks and the soft dressing may be removed&#xD;
      by the patient on the third day after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The custom plaster splint is the historical standard. The surgical incision is dressed&#xD;
           with non-stick gauze, 4x4 gauze pads, cotton padding, a plaster splint applied to the&#xD;
           palmar surface of the palm and forearm, and then a cloth wrap to keep it all in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Velcro wrist brace is a commercially available over-the-counter splint which will&#xD;
           initially be fitted over a thin layer of non-stick gauze, 4x4 gauze, and cotton padding.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients in the soft dressing group will have non-stick gauze, 4x4 gauze, cotton&#xD;
           padding, and a cloth wrap. It will be the same dressing as the custom splint without the&#xD;
           plaster slab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized using REDCap Randomization module after being consented to&#xD;
      participate in the study by the primary investigator or sub-investigator. Each investigator&#xD;
      will have the option during and/or after surgery to remove the patient from the group they&#xD;
      have been randomized into and treat them as they see appropriate. These patients would be&#xD;
      documented but removed from the study follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient satisfaction will be evaluated subjectively with the PRWE (Patient-Rated Wrist&#xD;
      Evaluation) as well as the Quick Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder, and Hand (Quick-DASH)&#xD;
      score. Radiographs will be taken at 2, 6, 12, and 24 weeks postoperatively to measure&#xD;
      fracture alignment and healing. Patient reported pain level, range of motion, grip, and pinch&#xD;
      strength will be recorded at each visit as well as at a final 1 year follow-up visit. Any&#xD;
      complication will be noted. All of these visits are part of the standard of care. The only&#xD;
      additional part of their visit would be the brief survey including the QuickDASH and PRWE&#xD;
      that they complete with an orthopaedic surgery resident during their visit. In addition at&#xD;
      the first follow up appointment at 2 weeks post-surgery, patients will be asked about their&#xD;
      satisfaction with the mobility of their wrist and those in the Velcro brace will be asked how&#xD;
      often they wore the brace. All data will be collected on a data collection sheet and then&#xD;
      entered into a database&#xD;
