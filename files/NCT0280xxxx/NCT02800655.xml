      This study uses an ingestion sensor and a wearable sensor (worn as a patch on the skin),&#xD;
      which are new Proteus Digital Health (PDH) technologies approved by the FDA, to collect&#xD;
      information about patients taking their ARV medications. The wearable sensor records&#xD;
      information, which is uploaded wirelessly to a mobile device and then to a secure computer.&#xD;
      Together the sensors and the mobile device transmitting the information to the study computer&#xD;
      are called a digital health feedback system (DHFS), which gives healthcare providers&#xD;
      information about when patients have taken their ARV medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the DHFS is easy to use and acceptable to the&#xD;
      HIV patient population; that patients will persist with its use; and that the system provides&#xD;
      valid, accurate measures of adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective single arm open label intervention study over 16 weeks using the&#xD;
      DHFS with ARV-naive subjects initiating HIV treatment. The study intervention has an&#xD;
      initiation (Phase 1), persistence (Phase 2) and follow-up period up to 96 weeks. In phase 1&#xD;
      Subjects will use the DHFS with close follow-up incorporating visits with directly observed&#xD;
      ingestions. In Phase 2 the Subjects utilize the DHFS in their natural setting with sporadic&#xD;
      study visits until 16 weeks. Eligible HIV seropositive subjects who are at least 18 years of&#xD;
      age, are HIV treatment naïve, and are initiating antiretroviral therapy prescribed by their&#xD;
      HIV practitioner will receive an ingestible sensor enabled oral Anti-Retroviral or IS-ARV&#xD;
      either IS-R/F/TAF (Odefsey®), IS-EC/F/TAF (Genvoya®), IS-BIC/F/TAF (Biktarvy®),&#xD;
      IS-DTG/TDF/FTC (Tivicay® and Truvada®) or IS-DTG/TAF/FTC (Tivicay® and Descovy ®). The study&#xD;
      will be conducted at the UCSD AVRC. Subjects will be recruited from UCSD AVRC, UCSD Owen&#xD;
      Clinic, related or affiliated UCSD HIV primary care programs or community HIV primary care&#xD;
      clinics. Following the 16 week intervention HIV plasma viral load and continuation in HIV&#xD;
      care are followed for up to 96 weeks. The primary outcome will be an accurate measure of&#xD;
      adherence i.e. the number of doses of selected IS-ARVs ingested, as captured by the DHFS,&#xD;
      over the number of doses prescribed, adjusted for PDA. The investigators will also assess the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of longitudinal monitoring in real time of the ingestion rate&#xD;
      utilizing the DHFS. In addition the investigators will evaluate the ability of the DHFS to&#xD;
      identify subjects whose longitudinal medication taking and timing patterns in the first 16&#xD;
      weeks of ARV treatment puts them at risk for detectable HIV RNA levels as far out as 96 weeks&#xD;
      from start of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PHARMACOKINETIC (PK) SUBSTUDY&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of 15 participants prescribed an IS-Dolutegravir regimen will be enrolled in a PK&#xD;
      sub-study to generate a projected time-course of drug concentrations across the entire study&#xD;
      period. On Day 14 of treatment sub-study participants will have a detailed PK profile for&#xD;
      Dolutegravir obtained over a single dosing interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will also have random plasma Dolutegravir levels measured at 4, 8, 12, and 16&#xD;
      weeks during the DHFS monitoring.Plasma HIV-1 RNA and CD4+ T-cell count will be measured at&#xD;
      study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the IS-Tivicay, participants included in the PK study will undergo intensive&#xD;
      monitoring of viral decay dynamics with plasma HIV-1 RNA measured at baseline and Days 2, 7,&#xD;
      10 and 14, as well as at Weeks 4, 8, 12, and 16 to provide the dynamic range of virologic&#xD;
      suppression relative to drug exposure profiles generated from the intensive PK sampling on&#xD;
      Day 14 and the DHFS dosing history.&#xD;
