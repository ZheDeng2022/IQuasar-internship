    <textblock>
      This is a closed-loop system which is embodied in a novel and intelligent algorithm that&#xD;
      takes into account patients' vital signs. The system allows better and responsive titration&#xD;
      of personalized pain relief together with non-invasive physiological monitoring that measures&#xD;
      oxygenation, breathing and heart rate continuously.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A glaring safety gap in the administration of commonplace Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA)&#xD;
      opioids unfortunately exists. A significant proportion of patients may suffer from&#xD;
      respiratory depression with the use of PCA opioids and it is imperative to discover solutions&#xD;
      to improve the safety of PCA opioids, therein improving medication safety, enhancing quality&#xD;
      of postoperative care and providing economic cost savings. Currently, no continuous&#xD;
      monitoring system that integrates an intelligent decision making response exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators primary aim is to develop and commercialise a Vital-signs-integrated (using&#xD;
      oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate) Patient-assisted Intravenous opioid&#xD;
      Analgesia (VPIA) that can be integrated into the hospital-wide monitoring systems is capable&#xD;
      of making intelligent decision making responses to bridge the PCA safety gap within 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This VPIA delivery system will be a closed-loop system for safety and efficacy. It will be&#xD;
      integrated with continuous vital signs monitoring, and provide appropriate response to breach&#xD;
      of safety parameters. It will be part of a larger surveillance system that provides tiered&#xD;
      medical and nursing alerts to safety parameters.&#xD;

    <description>Vital-signs-integrated patient-assisted intravenous opioid analgesia system (VPIA). The vital signs (oxygen saturation, respiratory rate, heart rate) will be close monitored when patients is using VPIA pump. The drug used is intravenous morphine (1mg per milligram) with bolus of 1 mg.</description>
