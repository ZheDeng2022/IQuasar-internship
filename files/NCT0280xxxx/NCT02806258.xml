  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the NeoAPBI 01 trial, the objective is to demonstrate the efficacy of combined APBI and CT&#xD;
      administered sequentially in patients with intermediate ad high risk BC. The hypothesis is&#xD;
      that combined PST-sequential APBI may increase the rate of pCR, breast conservation and&#xD;
      survival without additional toxicity, as seen with WBI&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total APBI dose is set to level I at 20 Gy (in 10 fractions over 5 days; n=5) and then&#xD;
      level II at 24 Gy (in 12 fractions over 6 days) delivered to the tumor using two&#xD;
      fractions/day of 2 Gy spaced by at least 6 hours. The biological effective dose (BED) is 32&#xD;
      Gy and 47 Gy for alpha/beta of 10 and 3.5, respectively. As compared to the standard&#xD;
      fractionation of 2 Gy/fraction the BED is 26.8 Gy and 30 Gy for the 2 values of alpha/beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of the impossibility to deliver two fractions/day, patients should be treated using a&#xD;
      single fraction of 3.125 Gy/day up to 8 fractions (total dose of 25 Gy). The BED is 32.8 Gy&#xD;
      and 47.3 Gy for alpha/beta of 10 and 3.5, respectively. As compared to the standard&#xD;
      fractionation of 2 Gy/fraction the BED is 27.3 Gy and 30.1 Gy for the 2 values of alpha/beta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both schemes, 95% of the prescribed dose should be delivered in at least 90% of the PTV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who undergo BCS after the end of PST-APBI will receive postoperative WBI (+/-&#xD;
      nodal areas) delivering a total dose of 45-50 Gy using standard fractionation (1.8 or 2 Gy)&#xD;
      or hypofractionated schedules using &gt; 15 fractions in 3 weeks. Technique and boost delivery&#xD;
      will be left at the investigator's discretion and local policy. Patients who had TM should&#xD;
      also receive PMRT if indicated delivering 45-50.4 Gy using standard fractionation (1.8 or 2&#xD;
      Gy). If the patient did not complete a full course of PST prior to surgery, CT will be given&#xD;
      prior to or immediately following postoperative RT depending on the institutional protocol.&#xD;
      Other post-operative treatments will be at the investigator's discretion. Adjuvant hormonal&#xD;
      treatment will be administered to HR+ patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase II randomized study designed for patients with newly diagnosed intermediate&#xD;
      and high risk non-metastatic BC who are candidates for a minimum of six cycles of PST using&#xD;
      anthracycline and/or taxane based regimens, who desire BCS but are not eligible due to&#xD;
      tumor/breast ratio. All patients will have a clip in the tumor bed before or after the first&#xD;
      1-2 cycles of PST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients who have consented to participate in the study will be randomized to&#xD;
      treatment Arm A or B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: 6-8 cycles of PST using anthracycline and/or taxane based regimens, according to their&#xD;
      physician's preference and center policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm B: The patients will receive 3D conformal or other modality (eg IMRT, VMAT) APBI during&#xD;
      their PST sequence. APBI will be planned sequentially between the PST cycles, 2 weeks after&#xD;
      the 3rd/6 or the 4th/8 cycle of PST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the purpose of quality of the target volume definition, it is mandatory to make a&#xD;
      planning CT-scan in treatment position before the initiation of chemotherapy. MRI or US&#xD;
      fusion with CT scan images can increase target volume definition and should be used if&#xD;
      necessary. For all patients, treatment planning should be made on a planning CT-scan shortly&#xD;
      preceding the initiation of radiation therapy to take possible tumor shrinkage and breast&#xD;
      shape changes into account.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CTV is defined as GTV + 1cm. The margin to the PTV depends on the measurements of the&#xD;
      center and thereby the positioning and verification techniques. If this is not known, PTV&#xD;
      should be defined as CTV + 1 cm around. The PTV should be used for beam shaping while for&#xD;
      dose evaluation and calculation a PTVeval will be defined as PTV excluding the skin + 5 mm&#xD;
      and the thoracic wall (ribs and intercostal muscles). IMRT should not be used in the&#xD;
      protocol. The PTVeval should not exceed 40% of the total breast volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients must undergo surgery even in cases of clinical complete response. Surgery will&#xD;
      be scheduled 4 to 6 weeks from the last day of PST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Modified radical mastectomy is indicated in case of limited clinical response, or progressive&#xD;
      disease, or if tumor size/breast size does not permit BCS. The decision should be based on US&#xD;
      or MRI confirmation of the response. Post TM radiation therapy should be applied according to&#xD;
      the center's guidelines. High risk patients should receive nodal radiotherapy policy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who undergo BCS after the end of PST-APBI, will receive postoperative RT. This&#xD;
      will consist of WBI (+/- nodal areas) to a total dose of 45-50 Gy using standard&#xD;
      fractionation (1.8 or 2 Gy) or hypofractionated schedules using &gt; 15 fractions in 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Technique and boost delivery will be left at the investigator's discretion and local policy.&#xD;
      Patients who had TM should also receive PMRT, 45-50.4 Gy using standard fractionation (1.8 or&#xD;
      2 Gy). If the patient did not complete a full course of PST prior to surgery, CT will be&#xD;
      given prior to or immediately following postoperative RT depending on the institutional&#xD;
      protocol. Other post-operative treatments will be at the investigator's discretion. Adjuvant&#xD;
      hormonal treatment will be administered to HR+ patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients randomized to the standard treatment arm will receive a minimum of 6-8 cycles of&#xD;
      PST using an anthracycline and/or taxane based regimen. Surgery will consist of BCS or TM&#xD;
      according to clinical response and tumor/breast volume ratio obtained after PST. After&#xD;
      surgery, the patients will receive standard RT to the whole breast (45-50.4 Gy in 25-28&#xD;
      fractions) or equivalent using hypofractionated schedule &gt; 15 fractions in 3 weeks. RT&#xD;
      technique and the addition of boost are left to the investigator decision according to&#xD;
      institutional protocol. Adjuvant ET will be administered to HR+ patients after the end of&#xD;
      radiotherapy during at least 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auxiliary translational study Tumor core biopsies for translational studies and genetic&#xD;
      analysis will be obtained at baseline and from the resected tumor at surgery following PST&#xD;
      +/- APBI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will focus on the prediction of pCR using cell metabolism, hypoxia and&#xD;
      angiogenesis markers (Scottish Group). Another objective is to correlate these markers with&#xD;
      the metabolic imaging for pCR prediction (Oscar Lambret Center, France).&#xD;
