  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is important that patients who suffer from Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) have their disease&#xD;
      monitored at an early stage, as well as when it is established. Presently, if a patient is to&#xD;
      be assessed by means of disease activity scores and blood tests, they must attend a hospital&#xD;
      appointment, which can be difficult for patients who live far from the clinic. It would be&#xD;
      beneficial to be able to monitor and reliably define and report a disease 'flare' at home.&#xD;
      Quite often, by the time the patient attends for an appointment, flare ups have subsided.&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the possibility for patients to take their own blood samples in the&#xD;
      comfort of their own home, by transferring finger prick blood droplets to a dried blood spot&#xD;
      sample (DBSS) card. Patients would then send the cards to the laboratory to test for&#xD;
      clinically relevant protein markers. The feasibility of 'remote' monitoring of the patient's&#xD;
      disease will be explored.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In an arthritis patient population living some distance from hospitals, collection of a&#xD;
      series of blood samples to monitor disease activity in a timely fashion is difficult. The&#xD;
      ability to monitor markers of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein (CRP) and gauge a&#xD;
      patient's response to treatments via disease activity score (i.e. DAS28-ESR) is not just&#xD;
      important in early stage disease but also in patients with established disease. Patients with&#xD;
      chronic disease tend to lose self-confidence in managing their condition and a substantial&#xD;
      proportion can suffer recurrent disease flare- ups. These flare-ups are costly in terms of&#xD;
      appointments with GP and specialist clinics and result in significant work disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Being able to reliably define and report a disease 'flare' in arthritis is currently&#xD;
      problematic as there are no objective measures available to the patient while at home. The&#xD;
      clear definition of a flare, as determined through blood testing would help justify an&#xD;
      increase in immunosuppressant dose or a course of steroids. Currently, patients make a visit&#xD;
      to their GP or hospital clinic, at 6 week intervals at best. In reality, this means that&#xD;
      opportunities to monitor CRP during an active 'flare' are often missed and an informed&#xD;
      intervention (medication adjustments) is not possible. Home monitoring is constrained by the&#xD;
      costs of making phlebotomists available to make frequent home visits to patients. Also for&#xD;
      markers which are unstable at ambient temperatures, blood samples need to be refrigerated and&#xD;
      rapidly transported to the laboratory for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the ability for the patient to collect their own blood samples in their own home and&#xD;
      send these at ambient temperature to a laboratory would enable 'remote' and timely monitoring&#xD;
      of chronic disease. The investigators have recently completed an Arthritis Research UK funded&#xD;
      clinical study that demonstrated that a number of clinically relevant proteins related to&#xD;
      flares (i.e.?) were reliably collected, stored for less than three months and extracted from&#xD;
      dried blood spots (n=20 arthritis patients). The paper cards used to collect blood droplets&#xD;
      were pre-treated to stabilise proteins and minimise haemolysis contamination (caused by&#xD;
      bursting and breakdown of red blood cells). Our results across 20 arthritis patients revealed&#xD;
      that 90% recovery rates can be achieved from dried blood spot sample (DBSS) stored at room&#xD;
      temperature for 3 month (relative to a matched -20'C frozen plasma sample). The inflammation&#xD;
      marker proteins included C-reactive protein (CRP), tumour necrosis factor alpha and&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin G. Without pre-treatment of the DBSS paper, only 53% of these proteins are&#xD;
      recovered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the patient, use of DBSS means that GP and hospital visits to take blood and carry out&#xD;
      tests could be reduced. With minimal training, samples would be obtained simply at home by&#xD;
      the patient, over a six week period and then transported at room temperature using&#xD;
      conventional post. Proteins could then be analysed at a central lab. In the future, the&#xD;
      technology could accompany patient assessments of disease activity and complement ongoing&#xD;
      studies focused on wearable sensors to measure joint movement and stiffness (UU Data-glove&#xD;
      project).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the hospital trust, use of this novel technology could obviate the need for patients to&#xD;
      attend the clinic for blood sampling. Soon after prescribing a new treatment, clinicians&#xD;
      could use DBSS to monitor treatment efficacy in reducing inflammation. This technology&#xD;
      therefore offers an earlier opportunity than currently available to titre dosage and switch&#xD;
      from ineffective drugs or treatments associated with adverse events. Furthermore, feedback of&#xD;
      the monitoring information provided by DBSS could be given to the patient, via for example&#xD;
      smartphone application, and has the potential to improve adherence to treatment plans.&#xD;
