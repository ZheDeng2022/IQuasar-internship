  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      You are being asked to take part in this study because you either had Ph positive B-lineage&#xD;
      acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) or still have a small amount of the disease and recently&#xD;
      received an allogeneic stem cell transplant (cells from someone else).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this clinical research study is to learn if blinatumomab in patients who have had&#xD;
      an allogeneic stem cell transplant can help to control ALL or prevent ALL from coming back in&#xD;
      patients who either have a small amount of ALL or have had ALL in the past. The safety of&#xD;
      this drug will also be studied.&#xD;

      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Every study cycle will be 6 weeks. You may receive up to 4 cycles of blinatumomab. Each cycle&#xD;
      will start around 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after your stem cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each cycle, you will receive blinatumomab as a continuous infusion by vein for 4 weeks,&#xD;
      followed by a 2 week &quot;rest period&quot; during which you will not receive blinatumomab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will need to remain in the hospital for the first 2 cycles so that you can be checked on&#xD;
      for side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may receive blinatumomab for up to 1 year. You will no longer be able to receive the&#xD;
      study drug if the disease comes back (if you do not have ALL), if the disease gets worse (if&#xD;
      you have a small amount of ALL), if intolerable side effects occur, or if you are unable to&#xD;
      follow study directions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before each cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam. As part of the physical exam, you will be checked for&#xD;
           graft versus host disease (GVHD, when transplanted donor tissue attacks the tissues of&#xD;
           the recipient's body).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to learn the effectiveness of the stem cell&#xD;
           transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to check the status of the disease and&#xD;
           for cytogenetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once a week during each cycle, blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End of Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 2 weeks after your last dose of blinatumomab:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 4 tablespoons) will be drawn to learn the effectiveness of the stem cell&#xD;
           transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration to check the status of the disease and&#xD;
           for cytogenetic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Blinatumomab is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) negative B-ALL that has returned after&#xD;
      treatment. Its use in patients with Ph positive B-lineage ALL is investigational.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 30 participants will be enrolled in this study. All will take part at MD Anderson.&#xD;

    <description>Participants receive Blinatumomab as continuous intravenous infusion at a dose of 28 µg/24 hours over 4 weeks followed by a treatment-free period of 2 weeks, defined as one 6-week treatment cycle. In the first induction cycle, the initial dose of Blinatumomab is 9 µg/day for the first 7 days of treatment which then will be escalated (dose step) to 28 µg/day starting on day 8 (week 2) through day 29 (week 4). For all subsequent cycles, 28 µg/day is the dose for all 4 weeks of continuous treatment. Participants receive 4 cycles of blinatumomab at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months following hematopoietic cell transplantation (HCT).</description>
