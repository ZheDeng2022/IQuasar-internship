  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study would be the first to investigate the relationship between reward- and or&#xD;
      social stimuli-induced dopamine (DA) release and neural function using a combined PET/fMRI&#xD;
      approach. Data from this project conducted in healthy subjects will provide preliminary data&#xD;
      for a larger grant application to study patient populations with known abnormalities in DA&#xD;
      including schizophrenia, major depressive, substance use, and eating disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Aim 1. To test the relationship between reward-induced dopamine (DA) release on changes in&#xD;
      resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) in healthy subjects. In 20 healthy adults, the&#xD;
      investigators will examine DA release (measured using positron emission tomography, PET) in&#xD;
      the ventral striatum, thalamus, and prefrontal cortex, as previously described. Before and&#xD;
      after the task the investigators will examine RSFC (measured using functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging, fMRI) between these structures, which have been shown to form functional&#xD;
      pathways serving motivation and emotion regulation in rodents and nonhuman primates. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that DA release will impact the functional relationship between&#xD;
      these and other structures as determined by changes in RSFC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2. To examine the relationship between dopamine release and the Reward Positivity (RewP)&#xD;
      potential. Subjects will be presented with the option to participate in an event-related&#xD;
      potential (ERP) study. The investigators will correlate the amount of DA release with the&#xD;
      amplitude of the RewP potential, an ERP that is enhanced in reward versus non-reward&#xD;
      circumstances. Based on previous studies, the investigators hypothesize that RewP amplitude&#xD;
      will positively correlate with dopamine release in the nucleus accumbens.&#xD;
