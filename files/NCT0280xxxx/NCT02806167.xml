  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Expedient diagnosis and management of acute cauda equina syndrome (CES) is essential to&#xD;
      prevent long-term neurological sequelae for these patients. The clinical diagnosis of CES is&#xD;
      confirmed using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However the clinical features of CES&#xD;
      (secondary to bladder and bowel sphincter dysfunction) are variable and are common presenting&#xD;
      features of other pathologies of the bladder and bowel, therefore most patients who undergo&#xD;
      MRI for suspected CES have no compressive lesion evident on the MRI, excluding the diagnosis&#xD;
      of CES. Urgent MRI scanning performed out of hours is therefore often unnecessary, however,&#xD;
      the morbidity to the patient due to a delay in diagnosis is so significant that urgent MRI&#xD;
      scanning is the current gold standard and duty of care in all cases of suspected CES. More&#xD;
      objective methods of assessing patients with suspected acute CES could allow rationing of out&#xD;
      of hours MRI scanning and reduce inappropriate admission without impacting patient safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of a clinical algorithm which utilises&#xD;
      digital rectal examination and ultrasound bladder scanning to stratify patients into high and&#xD;
      low risk groups. Patients considered high risk will be admitted and sent for urgent MRI,&#xD;
      whereas low risk patients will be discharged and undergo MRI scan within 5 days of&#xD;
      presentation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients with suspected CES will be seen and assessed by a member of the on-call team&#xD;
      i.e. either a spinal fellow, spinal SpR, orthopaedic SpR or junior doctor, on presentation.&#xD;
      Clinical features will be documented and stored in the patient notes. This document will then&#xD;
      be photocopied for use in the study. Digital rectal examination will be performed to assess&#xD;
      anal sphincter tone, voluntary control (anal contraction) and sensation of sharp and light&#xD;
      touch with a chaperone present. Those with abnormal perianal sensation will be admitted and&#xD;
      referred for urgent MRI. (NB: For the purposes of this study, these patients will also&#xD;
      undergo pre and post-micturition bladder scans in order to allow the correlation between&#xD;
      perianal sensation and residual urine volume to be assessed thoroughly.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder scanning will be used to measure pre and post-micturition residual urine volume in&#xD;
      patients with normal perianal sensation. The on-call spinal registrar, fellow or consultant&#xD;
      will conduct the bladder scanning using the BARDSCAN IIs ultrasound device. Patients with&#xD;
      residual urine volume greater than 100ml will be admitted and referred for urgent MRI.&#xD;
      Patients with normal perianal sensation and residual urine volume less than 100ml however&#xD;
      will be discharged and receive an MRI scan as an outpatient within 5 days of presentation.&#xD;
      These patients will be advised that if there is any progression of their symptoms that they&#xD;
      should re-attend hospital. Any patient who re-attends, whilst waiting for their out-patient&#xD;
      MRI, will be admitted for an urgent MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of patients unable to void following pre-micturition bladder scan will depend upon&#xD;
      bladder volume. Those measuring greater than 100ml will be catheterised and sent for MRI,&#xD;
      whereas patients with less than 100ml will be encouraged to try again in 1 hour. Patients who&#xD;
      fail to void at this time will also be catheterised and sent for MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Follow-up All patients will be followed-up by the consultant responsible for their&#xD;
      care. Patients operated on for confirmed CES will be seen in clinic at six weeks and six&#xD;
      months following surgery (or as required). Patients who do not require surgery will be seen&#xD;
      in the next available clinic (usually within two weeks). Any unfortunate patients who&#xD;
      continue to experience bladder and/or bowel dysfunction as a complication of CES will be&#xD;
      referred to urology, urogynaecology, neurology and/ or colorectal services as appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Synthesis, Management and Analysis A pro forma will be used to assess all cases of&#xD;
      suspected CES. This will be completed as part of the initial assessment by a member of the&#xD;
      on-call spinal team and stored in the patient's notes. Demographic data will also be&#xD;
      collected. These documents will be photocopied from the notes and data transferred to an&#xD;
      Excel spread sheet and stored on an RD&amp;E NHS password protected computer. Hospital number&#xD;
      will serve as the only patient identifier. Photocopies will be stored in the spinal research&#xD;
      office, which will be locked when not in use. Data will be stored for ten years following the&#xD;
      end of the study period before destruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will be carried out using IBM SPSS Statistics v21 for Mac. Descriptive&#xD;
      statistics will be calculated and comparisons of means carried out according to the&#xD;
      distribution of data. The sensitivity and specificity of our proposed diagnosis algorithm, as&#xD;
      well as positive predictive values, will be calculated according to a 2x2 table. For between&#xD;
      groups analyses ANOVA will be used and for testing differences between patients with and&#xD;
      without post-residual volume &gt;100ml, an independent t-test will be performed. A p value below&#xD;
      0.05 was considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dissemination of Results To the best of our knowledge this is the first study to investigate&#xD;
      the use of post-micturition bladder scanning as part of a clinical algorithm for patients&#xD;
      with suspected acute CES. It is the intention of the investigators to disseminate the&#xD;
      outcomes of this study to regional, national and international scientific peer groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authorship, accountability and acknowledgement will follow guidance as outlined by&#xD;
      International Committee of Medical Editors. For core protocol publications (reporting on&#xD;
      primary and secondary objectives of the trial), the protocol team serves as the writing team,&#xD;
      usually with the protocol chair as lead author. For cross-protocol publications, with the&#xD;
      permission of lead investigator, other team members may act as writing team and may include&#xD;
      other additional authors as appropriate. Additional authors may include other investigators,&#xD;
      usually members of trial staffs or inter-departmental collaborators, and/or site&#xD;
      investigators. The principal investigator or other protocol team members may present data at&#xD;
      scientific meetings.&#xD;
