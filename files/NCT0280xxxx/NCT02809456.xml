  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will test the effect of nicorandil to mitigate the lung damage that can occur as&#xD;
      a side effect of radiation therapy for lung cancer. Thousands of veterans develop lung cancer&#xD;
      every year, and are treated by radiation therapy. Studies of lung radiation injury in&#xD;
      laboratory animals show that with nicorandil, investigators can significantly reduce the&#xD;
      severity of lung fibrosis and heart toxicity.1,2 Nicorandil is FDA approved and in common use&#xD;
      for treatment of angina. These studies will advance that work to human use. Successful&#xD;
      mitigation of lung radiation damage and heart toxicity will improve the quality of life in&#xD;
      veterans and non-veterans who are treated for lung cancer by radiation, and may also improve&#xD;
      cure rates of radiation therapy for lung cancer.&#xD;
