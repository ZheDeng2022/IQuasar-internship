  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first study in humans of ELX-02, an advanced synthetic aminoglycoside optimized&#xD;
      as a translational read-through drug (TRID) for the treatment of genetic conditions caused by&#xD;
      nonsense. mutations. This is a classical Phase 1a study designed as a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, placebo-controlled, single dose escalation to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability and pharmacokinetics of ELX-02 in healthy adult volunteers.&#xD;

             All other female subjects (including females with tubal ligations) will be considered&#xD;
             to be of childbearing potential and may be enrolled if they have negative pregnancy&#xD;
             tests on Screening and admission days and agree to use a reliable method of&#xD;

        Subjects with any of the following characteristics/conditions will not be included in the&#xD;
        study:&#xD;

             conduct of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participation in another clinical trial within 6 months prior to dosing (calculated&#xD;
             from the previous study's last doing day). If the previous trial involved agents with&#xD;
             delayed effects or prolonged metabolism, a 12 months interval is required.&#xD;
&#xD;

             gastrointestinal, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic&#xD;
             disease (including drug allergies,). This includes any acute or chronic medical or&#xD;
             psychiatric condition or laboratory abnormality that may increase the risk associated&#xD;
             with study participation or ELX-02 administration or may interfere with the&#xD;
             interpretation of study results and, in the judgment of the Investigator, would make&#xD;
             the subject inappropriate for entry into this study.&#xD;

             BP measurement should be repeated for up to two more times and the last BP value&#xD;
             should be used to determine the subject's eligibility.&#xD;

             by the Investigator as clinically relevant. In particular, subjects with ALT, AST and&#xD;
             total bilirubin â¥ 1.5 upper limit of normal will be excluded.&#xD;
