      The study seeks to determine the safety and feasibility of using adipose-derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stromal cells to treat symptoms of mild to severe knee osteoarthritis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Interventions to alter the natural course of osteoarthritis (OA) in the knee are elusive and&#xD;
      joint replacement remains the definitive management for refractory, end-stage disease. The&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic has a large, ongoing experience using autologous adipose derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stromal cells (AMSCs) for the treatment of a variety of other diseases under INDs. Thus far,&#xD;
      the treatments have been well tolerated. These data along with the investigators'&#xD;
      pre-clinical animal studies and published experiences using related approaches lead the&#xD;
      investigators to believe that this approach provides a reasonable safety profile to treat&#xD;
      patients with refractory painful knee OA. The purpose of the current study is to investigate&#xD;
      the safety and feasibility of single and multiple injections of autologous, culture expanded&#xD;
      AMSCs in subjects with painful, refractory knee OA. Subjects with unilaterally symptomatic&#xD;
      mild to severe knee OA will be enrolled based on satisfaction of inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female ages 40-70 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
                  receiving the study drug and will agree use adequate contraception (hormonal or&#xD;
                  barrier method or abstinence) from the time of screening to a period of 1 year&#xD;
                  following completion of the drug treatment cycle. Females of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential are defined as premenopausal and not surgically sterilized, or&#xD;
                  post-menopausal for fewer than 2 years. A urine pregnancy test will be performed&#xD;
                  prior to the administration of the study drug to confirm negative results. If the&#xD;
                  urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug will not be administered and the&#xD;
                  result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Serum pregnancy tests will be&#xD;
                  performed at a central clinical laboratory, whereas urine pregnancy tests will be&#xD;
                  performed by qualified personnel using kit&#xD;

               -  Females becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the&#xD;
                  duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer.&#xD;
                  Monitoring will include perinatal and neonatal outcome. Any SAEs associated with&#xD;
                  pregnancy will be recorded. Females in the multiple-dose cohorts (M50 and M100)&#xD;
                  who become pregnant during the treatment cycle will not receive their remaining&#xD;
                  injections.&#xD;
