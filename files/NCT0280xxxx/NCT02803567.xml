  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary goal of this project is to develop a tailored screening, brief intervention and&#xD;
      referral to treatment (SBIRT) model for youth with chronic medical conditions (YCMC) for&#xD;
      delivery at point of care during a routine healthcare visit, through conducting a rigorous&#xD;
      randomized control trial among adolescent patients with type 1 diabetes (TID) or&#xD;
      rheumatologic conditions. The secondary goal is to assess the attitudes and knowledge of&#xD;
      parents of these same adolescents, to explore links between parent beliefs and adolescent&#xD;
      behavior around substance use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed project is a randomized control trial to assess the efficacy of an SBIRT model&#xD;
      tailored to youth with chronic medical conditions. This trial is being built into a larger,&#xD;
      longitudinal cohort study to assess whether a set of brief, substance specific questions can&#xD;
      accurately predict adolescent substance use outcomes when compared to more lengthy, criterion&#xD;
      standard assessment questions, in cross-sectional and prospective analysis. The first&#xD;
      component of the project will consist of pre-testing an assessment battery and brief&#xD;
      electronic intervention with a small sample of 14-17 year old youth. In the second component&#xD;
      the investigators will randomize consented eligible participants into intervention or control&#xD;
      arms of the study and administer the 1) Baseline Assessment Battery and the 2) Brief&#xD;
      Intervention OR Treatment as Usual (TAU). In the third component the investigators will&#xD;
      follow up with all participants at 6 and then 12 months after study entry to reassess rates&#xD;
      of substance use through follow up assessment batteries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, the investigators will also attempt to enroll parents of all participants who&#xD;
      are present at the time of enrollment. The investigators will separately consent and&#xD;
      administer a brief assessment battery to parents to assess their knowledge and attitudes&#xD;
      around substance use, as well as opinions and attitudes regarding other health and risk&#xD;
      behaviors.&#xD;
