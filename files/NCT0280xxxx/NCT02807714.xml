  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find an association between a protein named Podocan and WNT&#xD;
      pathway regulatory molecules in patients with different forms of Coronary Artery Disease&#xD;
      (Acute Coronary syndrome, Stable Angina and Coronary Artery Restenosis). It has been found in&#xD;
      experimental studies that this protein is regulating smooth muscle cell function and hence&#xD;
      may be influencing the progression of Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). We are testing to see if&#xD;
      the same regulatory function exists in human subjects. Studying patient's blood will possibly&#xD;
      enable to identify an association between Podocan and CAD. This may help to better prevent&#xD;
      and treat CAD with improved understanding of the mechanism of the disease. No drugs or other&#xD;
      therapeutic interventions will be used for the purpose of the research study. Only blood&#xD;
      samples will be collected in the cardiac catheterization lab. As a part of this study&#xD;
      participants will be followed for repeat events or repeat cardiac catheterization over a&#xD;
      period of 24 months.&#xD;

      Smooth muscle cells (SMC's) critically influence the clinical course of vascular disease .&#xD;
      The close regulation of SMC migration and proliferation within the intimal space is critical&#xD;
      in maintaining a delicate balance between insufficient and excessive atherosclerotic plaque&#xD;
      repair . When SMC proliferation is too suppressed, the ensuing weakening of the fibrous cap&#xD;
      can result in plaque vulnerability underlying Acute Coronary Syndrome and when SMC&#xD;
      proliferation is excessive, intimal hyperplasia as hallmark of accelerated Coronary Artery&#xD;
      Disease can follow such as in Restenosis post PCI. While stents have vastly improved upon the&#xD;
      recoil and constrictive remodeling component of restenosis, the problem of accelerated&#xD;
      intimal SMC growth has remained. The current approach of delivering stents releasing&#xD;
      non-specific agents promoting cell death and/or inhibition of proliferation has been&#xD;
      successful at lowering the need for recurrent vascular interventions . However, this success&#xD;
      comes at the expense of delaying vascular healing, whose ultimate long-term clinical impact&#xD;
      is still being evaluated. Short and long-term negative effects on the healing arterial wall&#xD;
      such as delayed re-endothelialization, increased inflammation and enhanced thrombogenicity of&#xD;
      drug-eluting stent (DES) are undisputed. These side effects of DES are being masked by&#xD;
      prolonged and aggressive dual anti-platelet therapy, which is exposing patients - especially&#xD;
      the elderly - to increased bleeding risks and complicates clinical decision-making. This&#xD;
      problem also causes fear of too early treatment cessation, demands rigorous patient&#xD;
      compliance and is costly. These issues are not trivial in daily clinical practice and the&#xD;
      lack of reliable clinical predictors of restenosis precludes individualized and patient&#xD;
      tailored stent selection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Podocan is a protein within the Single Leucine Rich (SLR) protein family and is a previously&#xD;
      unrecognized component of the sclerotic glomerular lesion that develops in the course of&#xD;
      experimental HIV associated nephropathy . Its important role in regulating smooth muscle cell&#xD;
      function via the Wnt-pathway has been recently described by the investigators of this study .&#xD;
      It has been shown to modulate experimental arterial repair and a significantly different&#xD;
      expression pattern has been found in coronary arterial lesions obtained by directional&#xD;
      coronary atherectomy (DCA) from patients with restenosis compared to stable angina . These&#xD;
      findings do suggest a possible clinical predictive role of Podocan, and the Wnt-pathway&#xD;
      effectory molecules on the incidence of Instent Re-stenosis (ISR) and the need for Repeat&#xD;
      Target Vessel Revascularization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who present to the cardiac cath lab for angiography for the evaluation of known&#xD;
      or suspected CAD will be eligible for enrollment. It is expected that, based on angiographic&#xD;
      results, participants will fall into one of four categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. No CAD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Stable CAD, no intervention required&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Obstructive CAD requiring intervention (angioplasty, stenting, CABG) (Not associated&#xD;
           with acute event, such as MI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients presenting with Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)&#xD;
&#xD;
           In all elective/scheduled case, prior to catheterization, a peripheral blood sample will&#xD;
           be obtained via an IV access line previously placed for the catheterization procedure.&#xD;
           In emergent cases of ACS, blood samples will be obtained in the same manner described&#xD;
           previously if possible. It is likely that in some cases, such as ST elevation myocardial&#xD;
           infarction (STEMI), this will not be possible based on clinical care priorities. In&#xD;
           these cases blood samples will be obtained within 24 hours after catheterization. These&#xD;
           blood samples will need to be obtained via venipuncture and will be clearly&#xD;
           labeled/recorded as being collected post-procedure. Blood samples will be frozen and&#xD;
           stored in a -80Â°C freezer in the Research Institute. Samples will be batch sent to&#xD;
           Baylor Medical Center to be tested for the presence of Wnt and Podocan molecules (Wnt-1,&#xD;
           Wnt-3, Dkk-1, Sclerostin, WIF-1, sFRP-1, sFRP-3) by measuring circulating levels via&#xD;
           ELISA Obstructive CAD (non-ACS) Group: It is expected that 900 stented patients will be&#xD;
           enrolled over 18-20 months. Justification of patient numbers is derived by specific aim&#xD;
           of attempting to establish prospective component of our study, which is the prediction&#xD;
           of restenosis. Given a current average incidence of restenosis between 10 to 15 % (DES&#xD;
           around 7% and BMS around 20% restenosis rate) this number should guarantee around 100&#xD;
           restenosis events out of 900 patients. This should give a realistic statistical chance&#xD;
           to detect a possible clinical predictive value of our variables. Participants who are&#xD;
           consented and sampled but who are found not to have obstructive CAD requiring stenting&#xD;
           will be maintained separately in the study database as a control group for future&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;

&#xD;
             -  PCI performed during baseline angiogram? If yes - what type of stent, location&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participant charts will be reviewed at 24 months post catheterization to collect&#xD;
           covariates (like age, sex, race/ethnicity, high blood pressure, obesity, smoking and&#xD;
           diabetes) and to monitor for the following events:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Repeat cardiac catheterization&#xD;

           Comparison with Historical Samples: The principal investigator owns a collection of&#xD;
           historical tissue samples that have angiographically defined coronary target lesion&#xD;
           biopsies from clinical patients with stable angina and restenosis. The technique of DCA&#xD;
           (Directional Coronary Artherectomy), by which these samples were collected, is not&#xD;
           clinically done anymore, preventing the investigators from collecting these samples from&#xD;
           the current study participants. The current study participants will be grouped according&#xD;
           to exact same clinical criteria as the historic patients and hence represent comparable&#xD;
           clinical cohort. The expression of Podocan and Wnt effectory molecules (Wnt-1, Wnt-3,&#xD;
           Dkk-1, Sclerostin, WIF-1, sFRP-1, sFRP-3) in coronary artery lesions obtained by&#xD;
           Directional Coronary Artherectomy will be analyzed using immuno-histochemical staining&#xD;
           and quantitative histo-morphometric analysis comparing restenosis with Primary Stable&#xD;
           Coronary Artery Disease as published by the investigators (5). This comparison will&#xD;
           allow the investigators to examine the relationship between the level of the Podocan and&#xD;
           Wnt effectory molecules, coronary plaque physiology, and the study endpoint of disease&#xD;
           progression as evidenced by restenosis.&#xD;
