  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent neoplasm worldwide and also&#xD;
      represents the main cause of cancer death. However, it represents the main cause of death by&#xD;
      cancer. The prognosis of survival at 5 years is poor, approximately 13-15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies suggest that patients who clinically present with a limited number of&#xD;
      metastases, a term defined as oligometastatic disease, could have a better prognosis of&#xD;
      survival with a radical treatment, than for their counterparts with a greater number of&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to add more information to the current medical literature about&#xD;
      the benefits in overall survival of radical treatment of oligometastatic disease in patients&#xD;
      with NSCLC and equal or less than 5 synchronous metastases at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcomes of the study are to determine the global survival and progression-free survival&#xD;
      in patients with synchronous oligometastatic (equal to or less than 5 sites) advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      undergoing radical treatment of all metastatic sites and the primary tumor.&#xD;

      Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most frequent neoplasm worldwide and also&#xD;
      represents the main cause of cancer death. However, it represents the main cause of death by&#xD;
      cancer. The prognosis of survival at 5 years is poor, approximately 13-15%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timely detection of NSCLC is difficult and the options for curative treatment are limited&#xD;
      since the majority of patients are diagnosed in advanced stages. The standard treatment in&#xD;
      metastatic disease is cytotoxic chemotherapy with platins (cisplatin or carboplatin) in&#xD;
      combination with a third generation drug (vinorelbine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, gemcitabine or&#xD;
      pemetrexed). This therapeutic scheme results in response rates between 20-30%, with a mean&#xD;
      overall survival between 8-11 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years, research in oncology has focused on the development of therapies aimed at&#xD;
      molecular targets that control the growth and proliferation of the tumor cell. Various&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies (bevacizumab, cetuximab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (erlotinib,&#xD;
      gefitinib, afatinib, crizotinib) have been evaluated with this purpose in NSCLC treatment.&#xD;
      Clinical studies in advanced NSCLC, using these new drugs with or without chemotherapy, have&#xD;
      had favorable results by increasing the progression-free survival and the response rate,&#xD;
      without being able to demonstrate to date, a significant improvement in the overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various studies suggest that patients who clinically present with a limited number of&#xD;
      metastases, a term defined as oligometastatic disease, could have a better prognosis of&#xD;
      survival with a radical treatment, than for their counterparts with a greater number of&#xD;
      metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of the current medical information on clinical outcomes in oligometastatic disease is&#xD;
      based on clinical studies and retrospective case series of institutions. The majority of the&#xD;
      reports have included a mix of patients with synchronous and metachronous oligometastatic&#xD;
      disease, focusing on the radical treatment of specific sites such as the brain and adrenal&#xD;
      glands. These results have been recognized by the European Society for Medical Oncology&#xD;
      (ESMO) and have been included in its treatment guidelines for lung cancer (2012). The&#xD;
      recommendation states to consider some radical treatment in selected patients with solitary&#xD;
      metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is limited information about the clinical benefits in overall survival in the subgroup&#xD;
      of patients with NSCLC that clinically present with synchronous oligometastatic disease and&#xD;
      equal to or less than 5 synchronous metastases at the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to add more information to the current medical literature about&#xD;
      the benefits in overall survival of radical treatment of oligometastatic disease in patients&#xD;
      with NSCLC and equal to or less than 5 synchronous metastases at the time of diagnosis. The&#xD;
      outcomes of the study are to determine the global survival and progression-free survival in&#xD;
      patients with synchronous oligometastatic (equal to or less than 5 sites) advanced NSCLC&#xD;
      undergoing radical treatment of all metastatic sites and the primary tumor.&#xD;
