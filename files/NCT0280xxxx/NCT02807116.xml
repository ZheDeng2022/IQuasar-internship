  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective is to evaluate the effect of rifampin, a potent cytochrome P450 3A4&#xD;
      inducer, at steady-state on the systemic exposure of a single dose of pacritinib in healthy&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a single-center, open-label, one-way crossover, drug-interaction study. On Day 1,&#xD;
      subjects received a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib. Following a 7-day washout period,&#xD;
      600-mg oral doses of rifampin were administered once daily (QD) on Days 8 through 17. It was&#xD;
      anticipated that steady-state concentrations of rifampin would be achieved by Day 17. On Day&#xD;
      17, a single oral 400-mg dose of pacritinib was co-administered with the final 600-mg dose of&#xD;
      rifampin.&#xD;
