      A wide number of osteopathic techniques focusing on diaphragm have been proposed but,&#xD;
      although systematically and efficiently used, there is a general lack of evidences able to&#xD;
      clarify how and to which extent osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) on diaphragm is&#xD;
      effective and determines a modification in muscles contractility and motion as well as an&#xD;
      objective determination of the benefit on the patients receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore aims at investigating whether, and how, a single session of selected&#xD;
      osteopathic diaphragmatic techniques are able to affect muscle motility and thickness,&#xD;
      assessed by ultrasounds, in a sample of healthy subjects and to compare results versus a&#xD;
      group receiving a sham therapy and another one of non-treated subjects.&#xD;

      Introduction The diaphragm is the dome-shaped sheet of muscle and tendon that serves as the&#xD;
      main muscle of respiration and plays a vital role in the breathing process. Also known as the&#xD;
      thoracic diaphragm, it represents an important anatomical landmark that separates the chest,&#xD;
      from the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indeed, the diaphragm muscle extends from the trigeminal system to the pelvic floor, passing&#xD;
      from the thoracic diaphragm to the floor of the mouth. Apart of its anatomy and related&#xD;
      anatomical connections, the abdominal diaphragm has been proved to develop many other pivotal&#xD;
      relationships: neurologic, vascular and lymphatic, fascial connections The complex anatomic&#xD;
      and bio-mechanic structure of thoracic diaphragm, as well as its widespread influences and&#xD;
      interactions with both contiguous and more distant areas of the human body, provide a robust&#xD;
      rationale for an osteopathic and manipulative approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional osteopathy, as presented by the Canadian College of Osteopathy, is defined as: &quot;A&#xD;
      natural medicine which aims to restore function in the body by treating the causes of pain&#xD;
      and imbalance. To achieve this goal the Osteopathic Manual Practitioner relies on the quality&#xD;
      and finesse of his/her palpation and works with the position, mobility and quality of the&#xD;
      tissues.&quot; A wide number of osteopathic techniques focusing on diaphragm have been proposed&#xD;
      but, although systematically and efficiently used, there is a general lack of evidences able&#xD;
      to clarify how and to which extent osteopathic manipulative treatment (OMT) on diaphragm is&#xD;
      effective and determines a modification in muscles contractility and motion as well as an&#xD;
      objective determination of the benefit on the patients receiving treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a recent study da Silva and colleagues compared manometry pressures of the lower&#xD;
      esophageal sphincter before and immediately after osteopathic intervention in the diaphragm&#xD;
      of subject with gastroesophageal reflux founding a positive increase in the pressures soon&#xD;
      after osteopathic treatment ; however, the estimation of the impact of OMT on diaphragmatic&#xD;
      activity was indirect and did not provide any information about changes in motility and&#xD;
      contractility; in another large double-blinded, randomized, controlled trial, four hundred&#xD;
      and six hospitalized subjects with pneumonia were randomized to receive conventional care&#xD;
      only, light touch treatment or OMT, including the doming technique of the diaphragm, in&#xD;
      adjunction to conventional treatment for pneumonia. Authors found a significantly shorter&#xD;
      length of stay in the OMT and light touch groups vs controls but, once again, they were not&#xD;
      able to provide any causal relationship between OMT and diaphragmatic activity . Finally, the&#xD;
      effect of OMT in COPD patients has been investigated with contrasting results: in a study on&#xD;
      35 subjects OMT protocol consisted of seven standardized osteopathic manipulative techniques&#xD;
      including indirect myofascial re-doming of the diaphragm was compared with sham therapy.&#xD;
      Interestingly, results suggest an overall worsening of air trapping during the 30 minutes&#xD;
      immediately following one multi - technique OMT session relative to the sham group . Under an&#xD;
      indirect point of view, this result favors a role of OMT in diaphragm mobility reactivation,&#xD;
      since it may be related to a dynamic hyperinflation-like mechanism promoting air trapping. On&#xD;
      the other side another study demonstrated an improved lung function in severely obstructed&#xD;
      subjects with COPD following OMT. Thanks to the new hand-held ultrasound instruments, the&#xD;
      morphology and function of the diaphragm can be assessed in different settings, such as&#xD;
      outpatient clinic, pulmonary function test laboratory, hospital department and intensive care&#xD;
      unit, and under different conditions. Ultrasonography is the only non-invasive, non-ionizing&#xD;
      imaging technique widely available to directly assess diaphragmatic function. Two different&#xD;
      sonographic approaches permit the assessment of muscle thickening in the zone of apposition&#xD;
      and excursion of the dome of the diaphragm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study therefore aims at investigating whether, to which extent, and how, a single&#xD;
      session of selected osteopathic diaphragmatic techniques is able to affect muscle motility&#xD;
      and thickness, assessed by ultrasounds, in a sample of healthy subjects and to compare&#xD;
      results versus a group receiving a sham therapy and another one of non-treated subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective, randomized, double blinded case vs sham vs control designed study will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy-one healthy volunteers will be selected after obtaining written informed consent . A&#xD;
      comprehensive clinical history will be obtained in order to identify active or relevant&#xD;
      conditions included in the exclusion criteria list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The remaining participants will be randomized into three arms (experimental, sham therapy and&#xD;
      control).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The choice of recruiting healthy volunteers was oriented by the current lack of clear and&#xD;
      objective evidences on the impact of osteopathic techniques on the thoraco-abdominal&#xD;
      diaphragm. Therefore, since we were not aware of the potential influence of the osteopathic&#xD;
      treatment on diaphragmatic motion and function, we judged the identification of a diseased&#xD;
      population suitable for treatment an arbitrary choice and excluded subjects with known,&#xD;
      proved, or likely diaphragmatic dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: all participants, regardless of the assigned group, will receive a&#xD;
      comprehensive ultrasonographic evaluation of diaphragmatic motion and thickness (see further)&#xD;
      followed by a systematic osteopathic evaluation of the diaphragm. Following, subjects&#xD;
      underwent a differential intervention according to their belonging study group: the control&#xD;
      group will be simply observed while lying down over the operator's table without receiving&#xD;
      any treatment, the shame therapy group will receive a light touch approach (a gently pressure&#xD;
      over the chest and subcostal area without any therapeutic purpose) while the experimental&#xD;
      group will be effectively treated . After that, a new osteopathic evaluation, followed by a&#xD;
      repeated ultrasonography, will be performed in all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Noteworthy, the study will provide a double blinded design with both, the patient and the&#xD;
      ultrasonographist, unaware of the randomization group. Furthermore, the osteopath operator&#xD;
      will have no access to the ultrasounds measurement and won't be influenced by it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteopathic evaluation The techniques used to osteopathically assess the diaphragmatic&#xD;
      function have been discussed more in details elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound Evaluation Three consecutive M-mode and Bi-mode measurements of right diaphragm&#xD;
      motion will be systematically obtained. A subcostal scan by using a convex probe and&#xD;
      frequencies between 2.5 and 3.5 mHz will be achieved during subject's deep inspiration&#xD;
      (inspiratory reserve capacity), starting from functional residual capacity, according to&#xD;
      described protocols. After that, three estimations of the diaphragmatic strength by measuring&#xD;
      diaphragm thickness at end inspiration and end-expiration will be obtained with a&#xD;
      longitudinal scan using a linear probe at 12 mHz frequencies. The highest of the three&#xD;
      obtained values will finally be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Pre and post osteopathic treatment ultrasound evaluations will be compared in&#xD;
      order to detect statistically significant differences in motion and thickness. Secondary aims&#xD;
      will be to find out whether clinical, demography or lifestyle factors may be predictors of&#xD;
      response to treatment. Finally, the correlation between manual osteopathic assessment and&#xD;
      ultrasound measurements will be searched.&#xD;
