  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the efficacy of a specially-constructed crib mattress&#xD;
      that delivers gentle vibrations (stochastic vibrotactile stimulation) as a complementary,&#xD;
      non-pharmacological intervention for treating drug withdrawal in newborns exposed to opioids&#xD;
      in utero.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the therapeutic efficacy of stochastic vibrotactile stimulation (SVS)&#xD;
      for reducing withdrawal symptoms, pharmacological treatment and hospitalization, and for&#xD;
      improving neurobehavioral developmental outcomes in opioid-exposed newborns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates at-risk for NAS due opioid exposure in utero will be identified to investigators&#xD;
      by medical caregiver and/or prescreened using HIPAA Waiver for recruitment&#xD;
      (maternal-prenatal; infant-postnatal). Infants will be randomized into either SVS&#xD;
      (complementary to standard of care) or Treatment as Usual (TAU), restricted by equipment&#xD;
      (mattress) availability. Infants will be enrolled and assigned to a condition within 48 hours&#xD;
      post birth and participate throughout hospitalization. Infants assigned SVS will receive&#xD;
      daily intervention of continuous intervals of SVS throughout hospitalization using a&#xD;
      specially constructed crib mattress that delivers gentle vibrations at preset intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Determine the efficacy of SVS as a non-pharmacological therapy complementary&#xD;
      to standard of care for reducing severity and duration of opioid withdrawal in newborns&#xD;
      compared to TAU alone. Quantify clinical variables: NAS severity, treatment days, days in&#xD;
      hospital, velocity of weight gain, cumulative morphine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Compare neurobehavioral outcomes in fetal drug-exposed infants between&#xD;
      infants who received SVS and those who received TAU. Longitudinal outcomes assessment at&#xD;
      6-months and 1 year to test whether early intervention with SVS compared to standard care&#xD;
      improves physical, social, emotional and cognitive development.&#xD;

    <description>Infants randomized to this arm will receive daily intervals of continuous SVS (ON) and no SVS (OFF) throughout hospitalization, starting within 48-hrs post birth. SVS will be complementary to standard of clinical care (e.g., clinically-determined pharmacological management; routine parental/volunteer holding; breast and/or bottle feed). Infants will be scored for severity of withdrawal using standardized, modified Finnegan scoring system by clinical care nurses per routine clinical care throughout hospitalization.</description>
