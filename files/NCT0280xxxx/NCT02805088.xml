  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The initial aim of the project was to gain an understanding of the comprehension of&#xD;
      &quot;language-oriented&quot; emotions among schizophrenic and bipolar patients. By &quot;language-oriented&quot;&#xD;
      emotions, the investigators mean the emotions that are conveyed by means of language, whether&#xD;
      through the emotional valence of the words, the expression of an emotional state or emotional&#xD;
      prosody. Although they involve different diagnostic categories, schizophrenic and bipolar&#xD;
      disorders nevertheless share a number of symptoms, in particular in the emotional sphere, and&#xD;
      do so to such an extent that the question of whether there may, at the clinical, cognitive&#xD;
      and etiopathogenic levels, exist a continuum between these disorders is frequently raised.&#xD;
      Taking this hypothesis of a clinical continuum as our starting point, the investigators&#xD;
      explored the understanding of emotions contextualized by language in these two clinical&#xD;
      populations, namely patients exhibiting schizophrenic and bipolar disorders. To these&#xD;
      populations, the investigators also added the dimension of vulnerability in the form of&#xD;
      non-clinical participants varying in terms of their traits of schizotypy and hypomania, thus&#xD;
      orienting this project toward the early identification of cognitive-emotional markers and&#xD;
      possibly also their prevention.&#xD;

      The aim of this proposal is to investigate disturbances of understanding of &quot;emotional&#xD;
      language&quot; in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. By &quot;emotional langague&quot;, the investigators&#xD;
      mean emotions wich can be drawn from utterances, thanks to affective valence of words or&#xD;
      phrases, expression of emotional state or prosody. Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder share&#xD;
      several symptoms, particularly those related to emotional sphere, in such a way that it is&#xD;
      frequently asked whether these disorders could be formalized on a continuum. Comparing the&#xD;
      cognitive-emotional functioning of these two kinds of patients should allow identifying&#xD;
      cognitive markers of the psychotic symptom dimension common in both diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of the abundant literature regarding cognitive-emotional functioning in&#xD;
      schizophrenia and on the more infrequent literature concerning bipolar functioning, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that the difficulties in processing emotions, in attributing&#xD;
      intentionality and in integrating information for meaning are markers for the psychotic&#xD;
      symptom dimension common in both pathologies. To test this hypothesis, the investigators&#xD;
      chose to investigate language understanding because it can imply a semantic-emotional&#xD;
      processing and because it necessitates integration processes. The integration processes&#xD;
      obligatory operate on semantic information, from which it can be added, in ecological&#xD;
      situations, prosodic and intentional information. The proposed methodology involves different&#xD;
      levels of language, requiring more or less complex integration processes - literal language&#xD;
      and figurative language - and different emotional features - affective valence of words and&#xD;
      expressions and emotional prosody -.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct behavioral and electrophysiological (event-related&#xD;
      potentials) studies. For the later, The investigators will focus on electrophysiological&#xD;
      components well known to be implied in language and emotional processing: the N400, the LPC&#xD;
      (Late Positive Component) and the LPP (Late Positive Potential). The combination of&#xD;
      behavioral and electrophysiological indicators will allow the identification of the&#xD;
      neurocognitive mechanisms shared by both schizophrenic and bipolar patients, particularly&#xD;
      those who experienced a psychotic episode, in comparison with those of healthy participants.&#xD;
      These studies will be conducted on 60 stable schizophrenic patients, 60 euthymic bipolar&#xD;
      patients with or without psychotic symptoms, and 120 healthy participants, matched on age and&#xD;
      educational achievement level to each pathological group. Different instruments will be used&#xD;
      to investigate, in both pathological groups and their controls, different emotional&#xD;
      dimensions (anhedonia, alexithymia, positive or negative affectivity, depression, anxiety).&#xD;
      Investigating the cognitive-emotional functioning of patients from a dimensional approach&#xD;
      (psychotic symptom dimension) rather than from a categorical approach could impulse a new way&#xD;
      of thinking diagnosis or identifying factors of vulnerability and protection for these&#xD;
      diseases.&#xD;
