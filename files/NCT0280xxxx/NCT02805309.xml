  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a minimally invasive procedure for older&#xD;
      adults with severe symptomatic aortic stenosis who are considered high risk for surgical&#xD;
      aortic valve replacement. Despite symptomatic and survival benefits, many patients experience&#xD;
      functional decline after TAVR. This pilot study aims to test the feasibility of a home-based&#xD;
      exercise intervention targeting endurance, strength, and balance as well as cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral intervention to improve physical functioning and disability after TAVR.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We hypothesize that a home-based exercise program with cognitive behavioral intervention is&#xD;
      more effective than home-based exercise alone; home-based exercise program with and without&#xD;
      cognitive behavioral intervention is more effective than attention control educational&#xD;
      intervention in preventing decline in physical function and disability after TAVR.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The LLFDI is a validated patient-reported outcome questionnaire that measures both functional limitations (inability to perform physical tasks - Activity Limitation Domain score, range: 0-100) and disability (inability to perform major life tasks and social roles - Participation Restriction Domain score, range: 0-100). For both scales, higher values indicate better function (lower limitation or lower disability). Two domain scores are analyzed separately.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) Summary Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The summary score is calculated based on chair stands, walking speed, and standing balance (range: 0-12). Higher scores indicate better physical performance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the 2-Minute Walk Distance (Feet)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The 2-minute walk distance measures endurance. A longer distance indicates better endurance.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Dominant Hand Grip Strength (kg)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Dominant hand grip strength measures upper extremity strength.</description>

    <description>Number of participants who experience any adverse events and serious adverse events</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>MMSE is an instrument that assesses general cognitive function (range: 0 to 30). Higher scores indicate better cognitive function.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Class</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>NYHA assesses the extent of physical activity limitation due to heart failure. It ranges from 1 (ordinary physical activity does not cause symptoms) to 4 (symptoms occur at rest).</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Self-Efficacy Scale for Exercise (SEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The SEE scale measures self-efficacy about exercise (range: 0-90). Higher values indicate higher self efficacy.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the Outcome Expectation Scale for Exercise (OEE)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline and week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The OEE scale measures outcome expectation about exercise (range: 9-45). Higher scores indicate higher expectation.</description>

        <title>Change in the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) Score</title>
        <description>The LLFDI is a validated patient-reported outcome questionnaire that measures both functional limitations (inability to perform physical tasks - Activity Limitation Domain score, range: 0-100) and disability (inability to perform major life tasks and social roles - Participation Restriction Domain score, range: 0-100). For both scales, higher values indicate better function (lower limitation or lower disability). Two domain scores are analyzed separately.</description>
        <time_frame>At baseline and week 8</time_frame>
        <population>The LLFDI Computer Adaptive Test software for Windows could not be run after the Windows operating system upgrade during our study period. LLFDI scores were available for 36 participants at baseline and 10 participants at 8 weeks. Therefore, we were unable to analyze the LLFDI score change. Instead, we measured a disability score (count of 22 daily activities and physical tasks that a person cannot perform without another person's help) post-hoc (see post-hoc outcome measure).</population>

            <description>A physical therapist will make home visits, beginning within 1 week of discharge, to deliver an individualized exercise program and cognitive behavioral interventions.&#xD;
Exercise: Exercises will target balance, flexibility, strength, and endurance (source: https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/). Home visits will take place twice a week for week 1 and 2; once a week for week 3 and 4; every other week for week for week 5 through week 8. Participants are instructed to do prescribed exercises for 30 minutes daily. The duration of this intervention is about 40 mins.&#xD;
Cognitive behavioral interventions: The following cognitive-behavioral strategies will be employed: 1) enhance positive beliefs about exercise through discussion of benefits of exercise; 2) discussion of barriers to exercise; 3) individualized goal setting and self-monitoring progress using exercise calendar; 4) develop a detailed exercise plan on how, what, when, and where to conduct exercise; 5) $10 rewards for exercising ≥30 mins per day for ≥5 of 7 days. The duration of this intervention is about 20 mins.</description>

Home visits will take place twice a week for week 1 and 2; once a week for week 3 and 4; every other week for week for week 5 through week 8. Participants are instructed to do prescribed exercises for 30 minutes daily. The duration of this intervention is about 40 mins.</description>

Attention control education program: A health care professional will call the participant weekly for a period of 8 weeks to teach general tips about exercise and diet (source: https://go4life.nia.nih.gov/). No recommendations for a specific exercise program will be made, except for walking 30 minutes daily or as tolerated. Each telephone session will cover 4 exercise tips and 4 healthy eating tips.

          <title>Change in the Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI) Score</title>
          <description>The LLFDI is a validated patient-reported outcome questionnaire that measures both functional limitations (inability to perform physical tasks - Activity Limitation Domain score, range: 0-100) and disability (inability to perform major life tasks and social roles - Participation Restriction Domain score, range: 0-100). For both scales, higher values indicate better function (lower limitation or lower disability). Two domain scores are analyzed separately.</description>
          <population>The LLFDI Computer Adaptive Test software for Windows could not be run after the Windows operating system upgrade during our study period. LLFDI scores were available for 36 participants at baseline and 10 participants at 8 weeks. Therefore, we were unable to analyze the LLFDI score change. Instead, we measured a disability score (count of 22 daily activities and physical tasks that a person cannot perform without another person's help) post-hoc (see post-hoc outcome measure).</population>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The primary outcome measure instrument, LLFDI Computer Adaptive Test software for Windows, could not be run after Windows operating system update during the study period. The software was not maintained by the developer to keep up with the latest version of the operating system. As a result, LLFDI measure was not measured for most participants at 8 weeks. The investigators measured a disability score (22 daily activities and physical tasks), which is highly correlated with LLFDI scores.</limitations_and_caveats>
