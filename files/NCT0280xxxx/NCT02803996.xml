    <textblock>
      This is a single-site, randomized, double-blind, double dummy, placebo-controlled single and&#xD;
      multiple doses study of Aramchol in healthy Chinese volunteers. The subject population that&#xD;
      was enrolled for Aramchol 004 was not specifically designed to understand the PK profile of&#xD;
      Aramchol in subjects of Chinese descent. Therefore, this study (Aramchol 015) has been&#xD;
      undertaken to ascertain the PK profile of Aramchol following single and multiple doses in a&#xD;
      Chinese population under fed conditions utilizing the light breakfast from Aramchol 004.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will consist of two parts and the subjects will be assigned to two parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each part of the study, subjects will be enrolled in the study within 28 days of&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In each part of the study, subjects will be enrolled in the study within 28 days of&#xD;
      screening. The study will consist of two parts, and the subjects will be assigned as follows:&#xD;
      Part A- single escalating doses This part of the study is a single-site, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, double dummy, placebo-controlled single-dose study of Aramchol in healthy&#xD;
      Chinese volunteers. The purpose of Part A is to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability of&#xD;
      Aramchol tablets at single doses of either 400 mg or 600 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thirty-two (32) subjects will participate in this part of the study and will be randomized to&#xD;
      receive a single-dose of 400 mg Aramchol, 600 mg Aramchol, or Placebo. Drug administration&#xD;
      will be preceded by a light breakfast consumed within 1 hour prior to dosing. All drugs will&#xD;
      be administered by the study staff. In order to maintain blinding, all subjects will receive&#xD;
      two tablets on each dosing, according to the following administrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort A: 1 x 200 mg Placebo tablet + 1 x 400 mg Aramchol tablet (12 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B: 1 x 200 mg Aramchol tablet + 1 x 400 mg Aramchol tablet (12 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort C: 1 x 200mg Placebo tablet + 1 x 400 mg Placebo tablet (8 subjects) Subjects&#xD;
           will be admitted in-house in the evening before the first study drug administration (Day&#xD;
           0) and will remain in-house for 36 hours after dosing. Blood samples for Aramchol&#xD;
           concentrations will be drawn for 36 hours at designated time points as described below.&#xD;
           Additional ambulatory samples will be collected at 48, 72, 96, and 144 hours postdose.&#xD;
           Subjects will be continuously monitored for safety. An End-of Study/Safety Follow-up&#xD;
           visit will take place on the last PK sampling day, ie, 144 hours after the last dose&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the PK profile from Part A is similar to the existing PK data in non- Chinese subjects,&#xD;
      then the study may be stopped. If the PK profile is different, then Part B of the study may&#xD;
      be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B- multiple escalating doses Part B of the study is a single-site, randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, doubledummy, placebo-controlled multiple-dose study of Aramchol in healthy&#xD;
      Chinese volunteers. The purpose of this part is to evaluate the PK, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of Aramchol tablets at multiple administrations of two different doses. Thirty-two (32)&#xD;
      subjects will participate in this part of the study and will be equally randomized to receive&#xD;
      400 mg Aramchol, 600 mg Aramchol, or Placebo for 10 consecutive days. Screening for Part B&#xD;
      may begin during PK analysis of Part A. Part A subjects can enroll into Part B with sponsor&#xD;
      approval. Drug administration will be preceded by a light breakfast consumed within 1 hour&#xD;
      prior to dosing. All drugs will be administered by the study staff. In order to maintain&#xD;
      blinding, all subjects will receive two tablets on each dosing, according to the following&#xD;
      administrations:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort D: 1 x 200 mg Placebo tablet + 1 x 400 mg Aramchol tablet (12 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort E: 1 x 200 mg Aramchol tablet + 1 x 400 mg Aramchol tablet (12 subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort F: 1 x 200 mg Placebo tablet + 1 x 400 mg Placebo tablet (8 subjects) Subjects&#xD;
           will be admitted in-house in the evening before the first study drug administration (Day&#xD;
           0) and will remain in-house for 24 and 36 hours after first (Day 1) and last (Day 10)&#xD;
           doses, respectively; subjects will return for all other visits. PK blood samples will be&#xD;
           drawn on Day 1 over 24 hours at designated time points as described below. Additionally,&#xD;
           pre-dose (trough) samples will be drawn before dosing on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 9.&#xD;
           On Day 10, blood samples will be collected over 36 hours at designated time points as&#xD;
           described below and during additional visits at 48, 96, 120, 144, 168 and 192 hours&#xD;
           post-dose. Subjects will be continuously monitored for safety. An End-of Study/Safety&#xD;
           Follow-up visit will take place on the last PK sampling day, ie, 192 hours after the&#xD;
           last dose administration.&#xD;

                  requirement. If medical records are not available to document sterility, urine&#xD;
                  pregnancy testing will be performed at screening and check-in.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects must provide written informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             diarrhea, chronic constipation, gall bladder disease, pancreatitis, lactose&#xD;
             intolerance and celiac disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of esophageal, gastric, biliary, or intestinal surgery (excluding herniotomy&#xD;
             and appendectomy which are not related to gastrointestinal disorders).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known history of significant medical disorder, which in the investigator's judgment&#xD;
             contraindicates administration of the study medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any clinically significant abnormality upon physical examination or in the clinical&#xD;
             laboratory tests at screening visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Use of any prescription or over-the-counter (OTC) medications, vitamins and herbal or&#xD;
             dietary supplements within 14 days prior to dosing. Paracetamol or ibuprofen for&#xD;
             symptomatic relief of pain is allowed until 24 hours prior to the study drug&#xD;
             administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects who have taken anticholinergic or other drugs known to affect&#xD;
             gastrointestinal motility within 7 days prior to the first dosing.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Any acute illness (eg, acute infection) within 48 hours prior to the first study drug&#xD;
             administration, which is considered of significance by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Participation in another clinical trial with drugs, received within 3 months prior to&#xD;
             dosing (calculated from the previous study's last dosing date).&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Female subjects who are pregnant or breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Subjects who donated blood in the three months or received blood or plasma derivatives&#xD;
             in the six months preceding study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Inability to fast or consume the food provided in the study (including any clinically&#xD;
             significant known food allergies or food restrictions).&#xD;
