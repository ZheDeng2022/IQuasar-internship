    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, non-randomized, open trial to be conducted in overweight and obese&#xD;
      individuals. The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of the Elipse™ Intragastric&#xD;
      Balloon System for the treatment of overweight and obese individuals. The secondary objective&#xD;
      is to collect efficacy and device performance information to assist with future trial design&#xD;
      and device iterations.&#xD;
