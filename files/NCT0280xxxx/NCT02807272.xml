      A Phase 2 study to investigate the antitumor activity in terms of overall response rate (ORR)&#xD;
      of tipifarnib in approximately 36 eligible subjects with Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative&#xD;
      Neoplasias (MDS/MPN), including Chronic Myelomonocytic Leukemia (CMML), and 36 eligible&#xD;
      subjects with Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML). Subjects (amendment 3 Cohorts 1-4) will receive&#xD;
      tipifarnib administered at a dose of 400 mg, orally with food, twice a day (bid) for 21 days&#xD;
      in 28 day cycles.&#xD;

      This Phase 2 study will investigate the antitumor activity in terms of ORR of tipifarnib in&#xD;
      subjects with Myelodysplastic/Myeloproliferative Neoplasias (MDS/MPN cohorts) and Acute&#xD;
      Myeloid Leukemia (AML cohorts). For MDS/MPN cohorts, this study will assess the antitumor&#xD;
      activity of tipifarnib, in terms of ORR, in subjects with MDS/MPN, including CMML, who have a&#xD;
      high ratio of expression of CXCR4 to CXCR2 (CXCR4/2 ratio) in their bone marrow and in those&#xD;
      with a low CXCR4/2 ratio. For AML cohorts, this study will assess the antitumor activity of&#xD;
      tipifarnib, in terms of ORR, in subjects with AML who have a high ratio of expression of&#xD;
      CXCR4 to CXCR2 (CXCR4/2 ratio) in their bone marrow and in those with low CXCR4/2 ratio.&#xD;
      Subjects enrolled in the study will consist of patients with KRAS, NRAS wild type status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Subjects with MDS/MPN with high CXCR4/2 ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Subjects with MDS/MPN with low CXCR4/2 ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Subjects with AML with high CXCR4/2 ratio&#xD;
