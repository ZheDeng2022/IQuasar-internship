      Randomized trial of laparoscopic cholecystectomy with cholangiogram on admission versus after&#xD;
      resolution of pain for mild gallstone pancreatitis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to perform a single-center randomized trial to compare&#xD;
      laparoscopic cholecystectomy with intraoperative cholangiogram (IOC) within 24 hours of&#xD;
      presentation versus after clinical resolution during index admission for mild gallstone&#xD;
      pancreatitis on clinical and patient-reported outcomes. Additionally, this study aims to&#xD;
      determine patients' values and preferences that influence decision-making regarding treatment&#xD;
      options for gallstone pancreatitis. Hypothesis: During index admission for mild gallstone&#xD;
      pancreatitis, early cholecystectomy within 24 hours of presentation regardless of symptoms or&#xD;
      laboratory values versus after clinical resolution results in a shorter 30-day total hospital&#xD;
      length of stay.&#xD;
