  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early ovarian reserve decreased is one of the main causes of infertility for women after 35&#xD;
      years. The relationship between this decreased and exposure to chemicals, including&#xD;
      persistent endocrine disruptors or organic solvents, has been little studied. However,&#xD;
      several in vivo or in vitro experimental studies suggested that these chemicals may impaired&#xD;
      ovarian function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to study the relationship between early ovarian reserve decreased and&#xD;
      exposure to persistent organic pollutants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to study the relationship between early ovarian reserve&#xD;
      decreased and exposure to organic solvents and heavy metals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multicenter case-control study. This project will permit to increase the knowledge concerning&#xD;
      the etiology of early decreased ovarian reserve. Considering that exposure of interest are&#xD;
      frequent, the results may be important in a public health perspective. If associations are&#xD;
      observed in this study, the results may encouraged prevention strategy.&#xD;

      Cases and controls will benefit, as usual in France concerning infertility etiology&#xD;
      examinations, of a follicle antral count by transvaginal ultrasound and AMH measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At baseline, physicians will complete a short questionnaire to check the inclusion criterion,&#xD;
      the results of the measurement of follicle count and hormone measurement (including AMH).&#xD;
      Cases and controls will respond to self-administered questionnaire at inclusion with&#xD;
      information about their medical history, their demographics, their tobacco and alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, their occupation and products handled in the workplace. Blood samples (for&#xD;
      measure of persistent organic pollutants and heavy metals) and urine (for measure of&#xD;
      metabolites of glycol ethers) will be collect at baseline. Occupational exposures to solvents&#xD;
      will be defined using job exposures matrices. The risk of decreased ovarian reserve will be&#xD;
      analyzed using logistic regressions for each exposure of interest adjusting for potential&#xD;
      confounders.&#xD;
