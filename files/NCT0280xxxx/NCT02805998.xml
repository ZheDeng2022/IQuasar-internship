  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overarching goal is to utilize a randomized control design to examine efficacy of&#xD;
      web-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT-I) plus treatment as usual compared to treatment as&#xD;
      usual alone for insomnia and depression outcomes among pregnant women with insomnia at high&#xD;
      risk for depressive relapse/recurrence (n=208).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depression in pregnancy (&quot;antenatal depression&quot;) is common and associated with acute and&#xD;
      long-lasting adverse consequences for women and offspring. Insomnia is a risk factor for&#xD;
      depression in general populations, and poor sleep quality is linked to increased depression&#xD;
      among antenatal women. There have been no randomized control trials investigating&#xD;
      nonpharmacological insomnia treatment on antenatal insomnia and depression outcomes. Many&#xD;
      pregnant women use the Internet to seek pregnancy-related information, and report a&#xD;
      preference for mental health care within the home or obstetrics clinic. The overarching goal&#xD;
      is to utilize a randomized control design to examine efficacy of web-based cognitive behavior&#xD;
      therapy for insomnia and depression outcomes (CBT-I) compared to treatment as usual (TAU)&#xD;
      among pregnant women at risk for depression (n=208). Participants will be recruited&#xD;
      nationally to complete study questionnaires at five timepoints through pregnancy and 6 months&#xD;
      postpartum. Participants randomized to CBT-I will receive access to 6 weekly CBT-I&#xD;
      web-sessions and treatment as usual. Participants randomized to treatment as usual will&#xD;
      receive usual care and will be given access to Sleepio upon study completion. Our specific&#xD;
      aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate feasibility and acceptability of CBT-I for pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test whether participants receiving CBT-I show improvement in sleep compared to TAU&#xD;
           participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine whether participants randomized to CBT-I will experience improved depressive&#xD;
           outcomes compared to TAU.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To explore the impact of CBT-I on birth outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is strong conceptual basis to predict the potential benefit of this approach for&#xD;
      pregnant women. Targeting risk factors for antenatal depression may have significant public&#xD;
      health benefits.&#xD;

    <description>Sleepio delivers CBT-I through 6 weekly web-sessions (www.sleepio.com). Treatment content is based on CBT for insomnia manuals (Espie et al., 2007, 2008) and includes a behavioral component (sleep restriction, stimulus control, and relaxation), a cognitive component (paradoxical intention, cognitive restructuring, mindfulness, positive imagery, putting the day to rest) and an educational component (psycho-education, sleep hygiene).</description>
