  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates the long term effects of E. coli strain Nissle 1917 (EcN-Suspension)&#xD;
      probiotic bacteria administration on the number of both, bacterial and viral infections&#xD;
      during the first 24 months of infant's life. Half of study participants will receive&#xD;
      EcN-Suspension, while the other half will receive placebo. In an additional non-clinical&#xD;
      explorative evaluation will furthermore be investigated whether the early intestinal&#xD;
      colonization with E.coli strain Nissle 1917 affects the establishment of the intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the course of the present trial the participants will be observed during the first 24&#xD;
      months of life, starting right after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All newborns meeting all inclusion criteria and non-fulfilling any exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      included into the trial. Each participant of this clinical trial will be randomly allocated&#xD;
      to one of the two trial arms, by using the method of randomly permuted blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The newborns will be primarily treated during the first three weeks of life and re-treated&#xD;
      after 6 and 12 months according to trial interventional plan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data on the efficacy and safety will be recorded during control visits after first month, 6,&#xD;
      12, 18 and 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up examination of study participants will be performed two years after the end of&#xD;
      the participation in the present trial (i.e. at an age of 48 months), during which each child&#xD;
      will be examined for its normal physical and cognitive development (covered by the U8&#xD;
      standardized examination). In addition data on allergic/atopic complaints or symptoms will be&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an additional non-clinical explorative evaluation, it will furthermore be investigated&#xD;
      whether the early intestinal colonization with E.coli strain Nissle 1917 affects the&#xD;
      establishment of the intestinal microbiota. Therefore stool samples of study participants&#xD;
      will be collected at an age of 24 and 48 months. The microbial composition of these samples&#xD;
      will be characterized and compared between the two trial arms (EcN vs. placebo).&#xD;

    <description>The total number of infections observed for each participant during its individual study participation standardised per month during the first 24 months of life.&#xD;
An infection is an episode of illness caused by:&#xD;
Acute upper respiratory tract infections&#xD;
Acute lower respiratory tract infections&#xD;
Otitis media&#xD;
Gastroenteritis&#xD;
Urinary tract infections&#xD;
The duration of an episode of illness is defined as the time from the appearance of the first symptom of a study relevant infection to the disappearance of the last symptom. Infections that occur concurrently or one after another within a period of 7 days are only counted separately, if they belong to different groups of illness.&#xD;
All rhinitides that occur in the first year of a child's life are considered for the count of the primary efficacy variable. Rhinitides that occur in the second year will only be included if they were accompanied by fever (body temperature higher than 38.4Â°C during at least one measure).</description>
