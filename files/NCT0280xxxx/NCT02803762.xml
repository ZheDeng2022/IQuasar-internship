  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an open-label, absorption, metabolism, excretion, and mass balance study of 400&#xD;
      mg [14C]pacritinib (containing 100 μCi radioactivity) administered orally as a single dose to&#xD;
      6 healthy male subjects following at least a 10-hour fast (not including water) on Day 1.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The present study is designed to investigate the absorption, metabolism, excretion as well as&#xD;
      safety/tolerability of pacritinib following the administration of a single oral dose to&#xD;
      healthy male volunteers. The pacritinib dose is administered with a [14C]-labeled form to&#xD;
      enable detection and quantitation of dose-related material independent of possible&#xD;
      biotransformation. The study design allows detection of potential human specific metabolites&#xD;
      that have not been detected in the animal species. Subjects are confined at the clinical site&#xD;
      from the time of Check-in until Day 14 post-dose, but may be discharged from the clinical&#xD;
      site between Day 10 and 13 post-dose if study discharge criteria are met (i.e. completion of&#xD;
      sufficient radioactivity excretion). All remaining subjects will be discharged from the&#xD;
      clinical site on Day 14 post-dose irrespective of the study discharge criteria. The data&#xD;
      obtained in this study will be used for the further clinical development of the compound.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Negative history of drug abuse or alcoholism within 1 year prior to Day 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative tests on drug and alcohol screen at Screening and Check-in&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Negative hepatitis panel including hepatitis B-surface antigen HBsAg], hepatitis C&#xD;
             antibody [anti-HCV] and negative human immunodeficiency virus antibody (HIV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No clinical laboratory value outside of the normal reference range unless deemed not&#xD;
             clinically significant by the Investigator in consultation with the Sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Fertile male subjects and fertile female sexual partners of male subjects agree to use&#xD;
             effective birth control methods throughout the entire study. Female partners of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must use highly effective methods (defined as those resulting&#xD;
             in a failure rate of &lt;1% per year when used consistently and correctly). The&#xD;
             contraceptive methods considered highly effective are intrauterine devices and&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives (contraceptive pills, implants, transdermal patches, hormonal&#xD;
             vaginal devices, or injections with prolonged release). Male subjects must use a&#xD;
             condom with spermicide paste for the duration of the study and for 90 days after the&#xD;
             EOS evaluation. When abstinence is used as a method of birth control, only true&#xD;
             abstinence is acceptable, when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle&#xD;
             of the subject. Periodic abstinence (calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, and&#xD;
             post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agreement to not donate sperm throughout the entire study and for 3 months after the&#xD;
             end of the study&#xD;
