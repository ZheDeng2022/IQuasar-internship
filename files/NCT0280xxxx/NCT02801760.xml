  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a one-time, web-based quantitative structured self-complete (&quot;web-based&quot;)&#xD;
      survey for all subjects and a qualitative semi-structured (&quot;qualitative&quot;) interview for a&#xD;
      selected sub-sample of subjects to evaluate the consent processes in association with&#xD;
      research outcomes, specifically early adherence to Pre-exposure Prophylaxis (PrEP) and Human&#xD;
      Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) seroconversion at any point during participation in the ATN 110&#xD;
      or ATN 113 study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Decisional autonomy is a foundational, nearly inviolable principle of contemporary human&#xD;
      subjects research. &quot;Autonomy&quot; refers to a deliberative outcome reflecting an individual's&#xD;
      choice, outside of controlling influences of other agents. From the perspective of research&#xD;
      participation decision-making, autonomy incorporates five elements of consent: competence;&#xD;
      disclosure; understanding; voluntariness; and, consent. Adequate research consent processes&#xD;
      are thought to be challenged by group-level qualities that define a &quot;vulnerable population&quot;&#xD;
      in need of protection from coercion or undue influence. Age (typically less than age 18 in&#xD;
      the United States) is a widely accepted status-defining vulnerability. Sexual minority&#xD;
      identity or same-sex behavior does not define a &quot;vulnerable&quot; population but 45 Code of&#xD;
      Federal Regulations (CFR) 46 subpart A (Common Rule) allows appropriate protections for other&#xD;
      vulnerable populations as determined by an individual Institutional Review Board (IRB).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this study address issues within a larger domain of questions about the&#xD;
      primacy of decisional autonomy, and associations of autonomous research consent and&#xD;
      subsequent participation-associated outcomes. This mixed-methods study will enroll young men&#xD;
      who have sex with men (YMSM) and transgender women who have sex with men who are currently or&#xD;
      were previously enrolled in the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data from the web-based survey will be used to test hypotheses about the relationships&#xD;
      between participant age, elements of the consent process, and two key participation outcomes&#xD;
      (early adherence to PrEP, HIV seroconversion) in the ATN 110 or ATN 113 study. Data from the&#xD;
      qualitative interview will be used to explore in further depth age-related vulnerability and&#xD;
      disclosure vulnerabilities manifested for participants and whether/how they influenced ATN&#xD;
      110 and ATN 113 study outcomes. The interview will also assess decisional support and the&#xD;
      benefits or harms associated with participation.&#xD;
