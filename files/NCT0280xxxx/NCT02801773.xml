      The aim of this randomized placebo- controlled clinical trials is to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri containing probiotic lozenges as an adjunct to scaling and root&#xD;
      planning (SRP). Material and methods: Thirty six gingivitis patients will be recruited and&#xD;
      monitored clinically at baseline, 3 and 6 month after therapy. All patients will receive&#xD;
      scaling and periodontal treatment and randomly will be assigned over an experimental (SRP +&#xD;
      probiotic, N=18) or control (SRP+ placebo, n=18) group. The lozenges will be used once per&#xD;
      day during 3 month.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Gingivitis is the most prevalent worldwide periodontal disease, is characterized by&#xD;
      inflammation of the tissues surrounding the tooth without causing periodontal attachment&#xD;
      loss. Preventive and / or therapeutic measures to facilitate or improve their control are&#xD;
      therefore very important, much more if you consider that gingivitis and periodontitis are&#xD;
      considered part of an ongoing inflammatory process. Treatment of gingivitis, like that of all&#xD;
      periodontal diseases has been based on the implementation of control measures personal and&#xD;
      professional plaque. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it has been reported that although&#xD;
      mechanical therapy achieved significantly decrease the periodontopathogens, this may be only&#xD;
      temporary since bacteria can recolonize the treated niches in the oral cavity. In this&#xD;
      context, it has emerged as a new treatment strategy complementary use of probiotics such as&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri, which possess anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties.&#xD;
      Generally speaking, probiotics would promote health by competitive exclusion of some or&#xD;
      positive pathogenic bacteria. Objective: To evaluate the effect of the administration of&#xD;
      Lactobacillus reuteri as an adjunct to conventional periodontal therapy in adolescent and&#xD;
      young adult patients with gingivitis. Methodology: A randomized double-blind clinical trial&#xD;
      to evaluate the effect of probiotic lozenges Lactobacillus rhamnosus as an adjunct to&#xD;
      conventional periodontal treatment of patients with gingivitis will be performed. Expected&#xD;
      Results: Statistically significant decrease in bleeding and gingival index in the&#xD;
      experimental group compared with the control.&#xD;
