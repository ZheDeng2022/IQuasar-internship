  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This main purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety, tolerability, dose response and&#xD;
      efficacy of Atacicept in participants with IgA nephropathy and persistent proteinuria. The&#xD;
      study hypothesis was that treatment with Atacicept would reduce proteinuria compared to&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse Event (AE): any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with a study drug, which does not necessarily had a causal relationship with this treatment. Serious AE: AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs: AEs that developed or worsened/became serious during on-treatment period (time from the first dose of study drug up to the end of study [Week 96]). TEAEs included serious AEs and non- serous AEs. AESIs included infections, cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy/ ischemic heart disease, hypersensitivity reaction (including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid shock conditions, asthma/bronchospasm, and angioedema), injection site reactions (ISRs) and demyelinating disorders. Investigator or his /her designee assessed ISRs as local reactions (redness, bruising, swelling, induration and itching).</description>

        <description>Adverse Event (AE): any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered with a study drug, which does not necessarily had a causal relationship with this treatment. Serious AE: AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial/prolonged inpatient hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect. TEAEs: AEs that developed or worsened/became serious during on-treatment period (time from the first dose of study drug up to the end of study [Week 96]). TEAEs included serious AEs and non- serous AEs. AESIs included infections, cardiac failure, cardiomyopathy/ ischemic heart disease, hypersensitivity reaction (including anaphylactic/anaphylactoid shock conditions, asthma/bronchospasm, and angioedema), injection site reactions (ISRs) and demyelinating disorders. Investigator or his /her designee assessed ISRs as local reactions (redness, bruising, swelling, induration and itching).</description>
