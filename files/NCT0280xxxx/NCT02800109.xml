      The purpose of this study is to measure the impact of maternal malaria on child growth in the&#xD;
      two first years of life in relation to fetal growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is following a birth cohort of children born to pregnant women enrolled in the&#xD;
      study &quot;Impact of malaria infection in pregnancy on fetal and newborn growth&quot; (protocol OXTREC&#xD;
      14 08 and Mahidol 2009-003-01). In this cohort growth monitoring is conducted until 2 years&#xD;
      of age using routine anthropometric measurements such as weight, length, arm and head&#xD;
      circumference. A few additional tests will enhance the sensitivity of the study outcomes with&#xD;
      minimal risk. These tests will include anthropometry, screening, nutrition questionnaire and&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental assessment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an existing on-going prospective birth cohort of children born to the pregnant women&#xD;
      who had fetal growth assessed during pregnancy. In this cohort an expected 10% of pregnant&#xD;
      women will be exposed to malaria while the remaining will be free of malaria. Their offspring&#xD;
      are already followed up for growth monitoring from birth until 2 years of age with&#xD;
      anthropometric measurements including weight, length, arm and head circumference at each&#xD;
      scheduled visit. The investigator would like to enhance the sensitivity of the study outcomes&#xD;
      with minimal risk for the child by proposing the following anthropometric and screening&#xD;
      tests, nutrition questionnaire, and neurodevelopment assessment. In addition a prospective&#xD;
      cohort of children born after study approval will be followed on both protocols. The&#xD;
      additional measure include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Body fat composition (at birth, and monthly up to 4 months unless weight â‰¥ 8kg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Triceps and subscapular skinfold (at 1 and 2 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anemia, malaria and soil-transmitted helminths screening (every 3 months in first 12&#xD;
           months and 6-monthly 1-2 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Buccal swab (at 1 and 2 years)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurodevelopment (every 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Food questionnaire (at 1 and 2 years)&#xD;

        Participants in a current birth cohort. For those pregnant women who have not yet delivered&#xD;
        (circa n=25), permission for their unborn child to commence participation after delivery&#xD;
        will be conducted after ethical approval has been received. For those children who have&#xD;
        already been born in the existing birth cohort and less than 2 years of age an invitation&#xD;
        to participate will be proposed to the parent or legal guardian after ethical approval has&#xD;
        been granted.&#xD;
