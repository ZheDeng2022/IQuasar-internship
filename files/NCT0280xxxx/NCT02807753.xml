      To evaluate the prevalence of subclinical arthropathy in children with severe hemophilia&#xD;
      undergoing a prophylaxis regimen and without evidence of target joints, using a validated&#xD;
      ultrasound scoring method.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Persons with Hemophilia (A or B) often experience recurrent joint bleeds, most commonly&#xD;
      affecting the ankles, knees and elbows. These bleeds can lead to significant pain and&#xD;
      disability over time. If recurrent joint bleeds are not managed with prompt and adequate&#xD;
      infusions of factor concentrate, the damage caused by the presence of blood in the joint&#xD;
      space will eventually result in a condition called debilitating chronic hemophilic&#xD;
      arthropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initiation of and adherence to a prophylactic infusion regimen, starting with the first&#xD;
      or second joint bleed, is essential for prevention of progression to arthropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies have demonstrated that prophylaxis with recombinant or plasma-derived factor VIII or&#xD;
      IX concentrates is effective in preventing clinical joint bleeds and the progression to&#xD;
      debilitating joint disease in patients with severe hemophilia A or B respectively. However,&#xD;
      for patients on prophylaxis, the absence of symptomatic joint bleeds and/or structural and&#xD;
      functional abnormalities of joints on physical examination and plain radiographic images can&#xD;
      lead to the erroneous assumption that the prophylaxis is completely effective. It has been&#xD;
      established that patients with severe hemophilia are still at risk for subclinical bleeding&#xD;
      (&quot;microbleeds&quot;) despite seemingly adequate prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Young adults, despite a lifetime on prophylaxis and apparently normal joints are developing&#xD;
      arthropathy in their 20's and 30's. Prophylaxis as currently practiced may only be delaying&#xD;
      the onset of clinical joint disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recent advancements in ultrasound imaging (US) have been proven to be effective in&#xD;
      confirming a joint bleed, monitoring the evolution of a joint bleed and assessing the&#xD;
      resolution or recurrence of a bleed. Previous studies have evaluated the prevalence of&#xD;
      subclinical arthropathy in young hemophilic adults using both US and MRI techniques and&#xD;
      concluded that US is as effective and sensitive as MRI identifying these subclinical joint&#xD;
      abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to the investigators' knowledge, no prior studies have used US technique over an&#xD;
      extended period of time to monitor the natural evolution of joint arthropathy in children&#xD;
      with hemophilia who are adherent to an established prophylaxis regimen and have no evidence&#xD;
      of clinical joint compromise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The seminal Joint Outcome Study, which confirmed the role of prophylaxis in preventing overt&#xD;
      clinical joint disease, mandated a trough residual factor VIII level of 1%. While this trough&#xD;
      level significantly decreased overt hemarthroses and joint damage, the evidence suggestive of&#xD;
      microbleeds raised a question as to the protection afforded by such a low trough level.&#xD;
      Intuitively it would seem as if a higher trough level should confer greater protection&#xD;
      against microbleeds, and result in more sustainable joint health. The &quot;ideal&quot; protective&#xD;
      trough, has not been established.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' hypothesis is that US is a valuable imaging technique to monitor the&#xD;
      natural evolution of hemophilic arthropathy in children with severe hemophilia A or B who are&#xD;
      undergoing prophylaxis regimen and do not manifest clinical evidence of hemophilic&#xD;
      arthropathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through this observational study, the investigators will provide valuable information in&#xD;
      regards the prevalence, progression and severity of joint abnormalities. The use of US to&#xD;
      detect microbleeds before the cumulative damaging effects demonstrable by MRI, will also&#xD;
      allow tailoring of treatment and the implementation of new prophylaxis strategies.&#xD;
