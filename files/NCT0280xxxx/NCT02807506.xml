      This project develops and tests the use of service robots to track health of the elderly over&#xD;
      time. The objectives are to develop a low-cost mobile manipulator capable of a limited set of&#xD;
      elder- relevant manipulation tasks (e.g. picking up dropped items). The investigators will&#xD;
      visualize and model the use of the service robot during deployments at an elder care&#xD;
      facility. Feedback from focus groups with elders and clinicians will inform the necessary&#xD;
      engineering innovation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to develop in three stages a new affordable robot with the participation of&#xD;
      Living Independently for Elders (LIFE) members and clinicians. The robot will be developed by&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary team headed by Dr. Yim at UPENN (PI), Dr. Lau at Savioke, and Drs.&#xD;
      Johnson and Cacchionne at UPENN PM&amp;R and UPENN Nursing, respectively. The aim is to build a&#xD;
      low-cost robot platform that will focus on the simple, but key, repetitive, data-driven tasks&#xD;
      that robots do well. Rather than attempt to create a robot helper that mimics humans, the aim&#xD;
      is to free human caregivers from the time-consuming tasks that robots can accomplish with&#xD;
      facility, thereby allowing humans to focus on tasks that humans do best (i.e. human contact).&#xD;
      Participatory reviews of the developed prototypes will be completed at each stage (each year)&#xD;
      with the LIFE members and clinicians. There are three research questions the investigators&#xD;
      hope to answer all while building an effective system to synergistically satisfy the business&#xD;
      needs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      R1) Although activities of daily living (ADLs) for elder health have previously been&#xD;
      documented and categorized, no research has been done to characterize them from the&#xD;
      perspective of their feasibility of automation using an affordable mobile manipulation robot.&#xD;
      How can known ADLS be characterized according to how much they would benefit from robotic&#xD;
      assistance given varying levels of robot capabilities (mobility, limited manipulation, full&#xD;
      manipulation)?&#xD;
&#xD;
      R2) A manipulator arm must be safe, affordable, and performant enough to assist in ADLs for&#xD;
      elder heath. What new breakthroughs are required to develop new manipulation technology that&#xD;
      satisfies these constraints? ?&#xD;
&#xD;
      R3) A data-driven service robotics What are the concomitant key usability and acceptance of&#xD;
      service features required system has the potential to affect elder health in a positive way.&#xD;
      How can predictive service robotics best be used to maintain and improve elder health? Which&#xD;
      specific robot behaviors have the most impact on elders' well-being?&#xD;
