  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very early after the onset of the focal perfusion deficit, excitotoxic mechanisms can&#xD;
      lethally damage neurons and glia. Excitotoxicity triggers a number of events that can further&#xD;
      contribute to tissue death. Such events include peri-infarct depolarizations (PID) and&#xD;
      cortical spreading depolarization (CSD) within the peri-infarct zone or ischaemic penumbra.&#xD;
      Noninvasive brain stimulation techniques such as transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) are emerging as promising tools, owing to their effects on modulating cortical&#xD;
      activity. Experimental studies have indicated that cathodic polarization of the cortical&#xD;
      surface blocks initiation of CSD. Moreover, it has been recently demonstrated in murine&#xD;
      stroke models that cathodal tDCS exerts a measurable neuroprotective effect in the acute&#xD;
      phase of stroke, decreasing the number of spreading depolarizations and reducing the infarct&#xD;
      volume by 20 to 30%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose here a pilot study, in acute middle cerebral artery stroke&#xD;
      patients, with a double blind randomization: cathodal tDCS versus sham tDCS. The duration of&#xD;
      this study will be two years. Fifty acute middle cerebral artery stroke patients will be&#xD;
      included. The tDCS will begin within 4.5 hours of symptom onset. The main criteria of&#xD;
      evaluation will be the extent of diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volume between&#xD;
      imaging on admission and 24 hours later. The investigators propose the hypothesis that in&#xD;
      acute stroke patients, cathodal tDCS could be an adjuvant approach to recanalizing therapies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In a murine model, it has been demonstrated that a cathodic polarization of cortical surface&#xD;
      with intensities of 30 µA and higher blocked the spreading depression completely. There is no&#xD;
      study demonstrating this in stroke patients. tDCS is a powerful tool to modulate the&#xD;
      excitability of motor areas. Cathodal tDCS induces a decrease of 30-50% of motor evoked&#xD;
      potentials amplitudes. In another study, cathodal stimulation compared with sham induced a&#xD;
      prolonged decrease of tactile discrimination, while sham stimulation did not. In our study,&#xD;
      cathodal stimulation will be delivered over lateral motor area (C3 or C4, 10-20 system) using&#xD;
      an intensity of 2 mA, in order to assess if an inhibition, a hyperpolarization of the middle&#xD;
      cerebral artery stroke ischemic penumbra could be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      tDCS is characterized by an excellent safety profile. tDCS studies in patients were performed&#xD;
      with intensities comprised between 1 and 2 mA. Safety for these intensities has been&#xD;
      demonstrated. Minor tDCS adverse effects in healthy humans and patients with varying&#xD;
      neurological disorders were reported. These tDCS studies were performed for a wide range of&#xD;
      neurological and psychiatric conditions including pain, depression, Parkinson disease and&#xD;
      stroke rehabilitation. Mild tingling sensation, moderate fatigue, itching sensation under the&#xD;
      stimulating electrodes, headache were described. Tinnitus was also reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In human studies, durations of tDCS stimulation are generally comprised between 3 and 40&#xD;
      minutes, in iterative sessions. In our study, tDCS will be begun less than 4h30 after the&#xD;
      beginning of symptoms. Studies with murine stroke models demonstrated that cathodal tDCS&#xD;
      starting 45 minutes after middle cerebral artery occlusion and lasting 6 hours had a&#xD;
      neuroprotective effect reducing the infarct volume by 30% (20% in the group 4 hours of&#xD;
      duration, compared to sham). Based on these data, in our study, tDCS will be delivered 20&#xD;
      minutes per hour, during 6 hours. Usual neurovascular cares (IV thrombolysis, thrombectomy if&#xD;
      indicated) will be unchanged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some simulation studies have demonstrated that approximately half of the current injected&#xD;
      during tDCS is shunted through the scalp. Using stimulating currents of 2 mA, the magnitude&#xD;
      of the current density in relevant regions of the brain is of the order of 0.1 A/m2,&#xD;
      corresponding to an electric field of 0.22 V/m. Induced skin burns are rare. Skin burns are&#xD;
      preceded by a painful sensation. Saline-soaked sponges placed under the electrodes have to&#xD;
      remain moist in order to avoid these burns. In our study, patients will be questioned about&#xD;
      the tolerance of tDCS stimulation each hour. Impedance values of the tDCS electrodes will be&#xD;
      checked each hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cephalic electrode montage has been chosen. A setup with M1 placement of the target&#xD;
      electrode (C3 or C4, 10-20 system) and an extra-cephalic placement of the return electrode&#xD;
      (shoulder) leads to a twofold to threefold higher electric field in the brainstem as compared&#xD;
      to the more commonly used cephalic setup with the target electrode over M1, and the return&#xD;
      electrode over the contralateral fronto-polar area (FP2 or FP1, 10-20 system). Reported&#xD;
      cerebral autoregulation changes may have been mediated via stimulation of brainstem autonomic&#xD;
      centers. The use of a cephalic return electrode montage is thus recommended. Accordingly to&#xD;
      these recommendations, in our study, the two electrodes are in a cephalic position: C3 or C4&#xD;
      and FP2 or FP1 (10-20 system).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of our study is to assess if cathodic tDCS over M1 (C3 or C4) in acute&#xD;
      stroke patients allow to preserve the penumbra and to reduce the infarct volume (MRI day 1&#xD;
      versus admission MRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. to determine if tDCS improve clinical outcome at 7 days after stroke using the National&#xD;
           Institute of Health Stroke Scale (NIHSS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine if tDCS improve clinical outcome at 3 months after stroke using the Rankin&#xD;
           scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess tDCS side effects&#xD;
