      -  The study primary end point is the decrease in the number of monthly heavy drinking days&#xD;
           (HDD) (≥ 60 g/day in men and ≥ 40 g/d in women) from baseline to the end of the double&#xD;
           blind Randomized Treatment (RT).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The Secondary end points will be designed to assess safety and tolerability and to&#xD;
           further investigate the effect of pitolisant on other alcohol use criteria (e.g. total&#xD;
           alcohol consumption, number of abstinence days), craving as well as the improvement in&#xD;
           mental health (depression, sleep) and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total alcohol consumption (TAC) from baseline to end of treatment. TAC was defined&#xD;
                as mean daily alcohol consumption in g/day over a month (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percent of patients without HDDs during the 24 weeks RT phase of the study.&#xD;
                (Continuous Controlled Drinking=CCD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percent of Abstinent Days during RT phase (PAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Continuous Abstinence Duration from baseline during 24 weeks RT phase (CAD)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  4-week point prevalence abstinence at end of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Improvement in alcohol biomarkers (e.g. ALAT, ASAT, % CDT) during 24 week RT phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Craving (Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale) during 24 week RT phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) during 24 week RT phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) during RT phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment retention during 24 week RT&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life (SF-12) during RT phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Percent patients without HDDs during the OL follow up period&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of life (SF-12) during OL phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Quality of sleep (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index) during OL phase&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment retention OL phase Safety will be assessed by evaluation of treatment&#xD;
                emergent adverse events (TEAE), physical examinations, clinical laboratory tests&#xD;
                (blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis), subsequent end of treatment&#xD;
                potential withdrawal, evaluation scales and physical examination, measurement of&#xD;
                heart rate, blood pressure, and body weight at each study visit )V0-FU5). If at ECG&#xD;
                Fridericia's corrected QT interval ≥ 500 ms or if difference to baseline is ≥ 60 ms&#xD;
                it will be required to check ECG by second measurement after lying down 10 minutes.&#xD;
