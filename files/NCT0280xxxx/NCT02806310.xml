  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bicuspid Aortic Valve (BAV) disease is a common cardiac anomaly that is associated with&#xD;
      valvular abnormalities, both stenosis and regurgitation, and aortopathy. It is also shown to&#xD;
      play role in abnormal aortic distensibility and stiffness with impairment of aortic&#xD;
      elasticity and Left ventricular dysfunction. Mechanism of aortopathy is complex and is not&#xD;
      understood completely. In a recent study podocan is found in extracellular matrix (ECM) of&#xD;
      human aorta and is found to be accumulated in human abdominal aortic aneurysms. There is no&#xD;
      current effective therapy that can alter the progression of aortic dilatation in bicuspid&#xD;
      valve disease. Aortic surgery and aortoplasty is the only treatment in severely dilated aorta&#xD;
      and aortic dissection. In this study the aim is to investigate the association between&#xD;
      podocan and Wnt pathway in development and pathogenesis of aortopathy. This could provide&#xD;
      more effective and physiological understanding of disease process and potential target in&#xD;
      prevention and treatment for aortopathy.&#xD;

      Patients with known BAV will be enrolled in two inclusion criteria categories:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Group A: Patients who are scheduled to have a cardiac MRI&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Group A: MRI will be used as a standard procedure to confirm the morphology of&#xD;
      bicuspid valve especially in uncertain cases and to do accurate aortic measurements. Patients&#xD;
      who agree to participate will provide informed consent prior to their cardiac MRI/CT. A 6&#xD;
      minute walk test to measure baseline functional status will be performed after consent. All&#xD;
      patients having a cardiac MRI/CT have an IV line placed as normal procedure. When then line&#xD;
      has been placed, prior to contrast infusion a blood sample will be collected to test for&#xD;
      circulatory Podocan and Wnt pathway molecules. At 24 months post procedure the following&#xD;
      information will be collected from the participants' charts for endpoint analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital admissions for Aortic dissection, Congestive heart failure, endocarditis or&#xD;
           cardiac death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Valve replacement or aortic graft surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Group B: Patients who have already had an MRI within the past year&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures for Group B: MRI will be used as a standard procedure to confirm the morphology of&#xD;
      bicuspid valve especially in uncertain cases and to do accurate aortic measurements. Patients&#xD;
      who agree to participate will report to the Clinical Research Division (CRD ) for a research&#xD;
      visit to enroll in the study. At this visit, the patient will provide informed consent,&#xD;
      complete a 6 minute walk test to measure baseline functional status , and will have blood&#xD;
      drawn by venipuncture to obtain a blood sample to test for circulatory Podocan and Wnt&#xD;
      pathway molecules. At 24 months post procedure the following information will be collected&#xD;
      from the participants' charts for endpoint analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All cause mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hospital admissions for Aortic dissection, Congestive heart failure, endocarditis or&#xD;
           cardiac death&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Valve replacement or aortic graft surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who do undergo valve replacement or aortic graft surgery within the 24 month&#xD;
      follow up period, will have their valve tissue samples analyzed for podocan levels. These&#xD;
      tissues are removed as a routine part of the surgery and sent to the clinical laboratory at&#xD;
      Bassett. The number of tissue samples collected during this procedure can range from one to&#xD;
      four based on the exact nature and location of the aortic pathology. The Bassett Clinical Lab&#xD;
      will prepare additional paraffin blocks and slides of the tissue for the research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A blood sample will also be taken at the time of the patient's post-op MRI to test for&#xD;
      circulatory Podocan and Wnt pathway molecules. This usually occurs about 6-9 months after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that 100 participants will be enrolled in the study over 18 months. This is a&#xD;
      sample size of convenience for this pilot study based the current volume of patients&#xD;
      undergoing cardiac MRI/CT for evaluation of valvular disease. Of these 100 patients, it is&#xD;
      estimated that 25 will undergo surgery as described above within the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline analysis will be performed to study the association between circulatory Podocan and&#xD;
      Wnt regulatory molecules (Wnt-1, Wnt-3, Dkk-1, WIF-1, sFRP-1, sFRP-3) measured by ELISA in&#xD;
      peripheral blood and tissue samples of aortic root/ascending aorta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant's chart will be reviewed at the time of enrollment and the following&#xD;
      variables will be abstracted from the medical record:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  age,&#xD;

      All patients who do undergo valve replacement or aortic graft surgery within the 24 month&#xD;
      follow up period, will have their valve tissue samples analyzed for podocan levels. These&#xD;
      tissues are removed as a routine part of the surgery and sent to the clinical laboratory at&#xD;
      Bassett. The Bassett Clinical Lab will prepare additional paraffin blocks and slides of the&#xD;
      tissue for the research study. Specifically, aortic aneurysm and aortic root tissue will be&#xD;
      analyzed. The relationship between cell density (mm2) and Podocan, in addition to the six Wnt&#xD;
      molecule levels, will be analyzed.&#xD;
