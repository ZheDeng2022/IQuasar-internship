  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-arm pilot proof of concept, open-label clinical trial. Twenty-five subjects&#xD;
      will be enrolled in 6 sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic breast cancer patients with disease progression to bevacizumab maintenance&#xD;
      treatment will be potential candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab maintenance will be considered as six weeks of bevacizumab treatment in&#xD;
      monotherapy, with hormonal treatment or combined with chemotherapy in the context of previous&#xD;
      bevacizumab plus chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When progression to bevacizumab maintenance treatment occurs, patients will enter the trial&#xD;
      and will start receiving DURVALUMAB 10 mg/kg Q2W IV infusion plus bevacizumab 10mg/kg IV&#xD;
      infusion every 2 weeks. The patients will undergo a tumor biopsy before the first dose of&#xD;
      DURVALUMAB, and after one month of combined treatment - the blood sampling will continue on a&#xD;
      monthly basis. The treatment will continue until disease progression.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acquired resistance against chronic administration of the monoclonal antibody antiangiogenic&#xD;
      agent like bevacizumab in breast cancer is caused in a fraction of patients by an immune&#xD;
      reprogramming. The immune reprogramming can be detected by elevated counts of Tregs in&#xD;
      peripheral blood, aberrant pattern of cytokines, and elevated concentrations of kynurenine&#xD;
      and immunosuppressive/vasodilator prostaglandins. The addition of DURVALUMAB to a&#xD;
      bevacizumab-based treatment would delay or abrogate these changes and be of therapeutic&#xD;
      interest in this scenario.&#xD;

    <description>Durvalumab is an investigational human monoclonal antibody directed against programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1). PD-L1 can be expressed by tumours to evade detection by the immune system through binding to PD-1 on cytotoxic T lymphocytes. Durvalumab blocks the PD-L1 interaction with PD-1, countering the tumour's immune-evading tactics.</description>
