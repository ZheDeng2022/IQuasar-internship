    <textblock>
      Injured trauma patients in the Emergency Department (ED) may be a particularly important&#xD;
      group to target for screening and intervention for prescription drug misuse (PDM). These&#xD;
      patients have high rates of psychiatric and substance use co-morbidity and pain management&#xD;
      for their injuries (e.g. broken bones, burns) will often require prescribed opioid pain&#xD;
      medications and other controlled substances. To date, there are no effective ED-based&#xD;
      interventions for PDM. Collaborative Care is a longitudinal model of care that combines&#xD;
      multiple elements for patients with complex medical comorbidities. This model holds promise&#xD;
      as an intervention strategy for injured patients in the ED that are at risk for prescription&#xD;
      drug misuses. Collaborative Care from the ED is innovative and requires developing follow up&#xD;
      procedures on a population that has previously been difficult to follow and may have&#xD;
      previously avoided consistent health care delivery. The primary objective of this study was&#xD;
      to determine the feasibility of initiating a collaborative care intervention for injured ED&#xD;
      patients with PDM by enrolling patients into an open trial of this intervention. A secondary&#xD;
      objective was to determine if PDM decreases over time after enrollment and developing&#xD;
      successful follow-up procedures to deliver longitudinal care.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will be conducting an open pilot trial of a collaborative care intervention&#xD;
      for patients in the Emergency Department (ED) with trauma and prescription drug misuse. Since&#xD;
      this is an open trial, all enrolled participants will receive the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre Screen: Prior to approach, the Research Assistant (RA) will review the electronic medical&#xD;
      record (EMR) in the ED to first identify patients presenting for an injury and then to&#xD;
      determine if they are at risk for prescription drug misuse. The manual chart review&#xD;
      information will be entered by the RA into an Excel spreadsheet or equivalent. This process&#xD;
      allows the team to identify patients who are at high risk for prescription drug misuse prior&#xD;
      to approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approach and Consent: Next, the RA will go to the Emergency Department (ED) or inpatient ward&#xD;
      and describe the study to the patient. Informed consent will be obtained from those patients&#xD;
      who agree to participate in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility Screening: After consent and enrollment, the RA will provide each consenting&#xD;
      subject with a tablet computer so they can self- administer the screening assessment. If the&#xD;
      subject requires assistance, the RA can administer the screening assessment. This will&#xD;
      include some basic demographic items and a validated survey developed by the National&#xD;
      Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA). Subjects will screen into the study if they have a score of&#xD;
      greater than 1 on this validated survey, which indicates having risk for prescription drug&#xD;
      misuse. Next, subjects will answer questions regarding contact information including phone&#xD;
      number, email and address and travel plans. Since the intervention phase for this study&#xD;
      requires multiple contacts and longitudinal engagement, this information is important to&#xD;
      inform enrollment. The administration of this stage of screening will take approximately&#xD;
      10-15 minutes. As one of the aims for this study is refining follow-up procedures, every&#xD;
      participant must have plans to a) be in the local area for six months (e.g. no long-term&#xD;
      travel plans or plans to relocate) b) have at least two contacts and c) have a phone number.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All eligible subjects that meet the eligibility requirements documented above will complete a&#xD;
      baseline survey using a tablet computer and will be enrolled into the intervention condition.&#xD;
      This is an open trial and thus all consenting eligible subjects will receive the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collaborative Care Intervention: Subjects that are eligible for the intervention after&#xD;
      screening will be visited by a study care manager at the bedside in the hospital. This care&#xD;
      manager will use motivational interviewing techniques to elicit and target for improvement&#xD;
      each subject's unique constellation of concerns and needs. The care manager will also ask&#xD;
      about treatment preferences and will schedule ongoing times to meet/call the subject during&#xD;
      the initial days and weeks post-injury. The care manager will give the subject the study&#xD;
      team's 24-hour contact number and encourage calls for spontaneous questions, needs, and&#xD;
      concerns. These subjects will be given a choice of treatment options and the care manager&#xD;
      will share information and deliberate medical treatment decisions with each subject. Together&#xD;
      the care manager and subject will develop a treatment plan informed by each subject's injury&#xD;
      and medical needs, substance abuse needs, prescription medication needs and concerns. The&#xD;
      collaborative care intervention will be comprised of the following elements based on&#xD;
      participant's need:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medication Management: This element of the intervention will focus on appropriate&#xD;
           medication guidelines for prescription opioids, and patient comorbidities as well as&#xD;
           providing guideline adherence recommendations for opioid prescribing in acute and&#xD;
           primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Care coordination and linkage: Intervention team members will work collaboratively with&#xD;
           acute and primary care providers in an effort to coordinate care longitudinally through&#xD;
           outpatient follow-up. The care manager will meet subjects at their outpatient&#xD;
           appointments whenever possible. The care manager will also attempt to establish primary&#xD;
           care linkages for each subject. Stepped, higher intensity care linkages will be&#xD;
           available for subjects with severe mental health needs or substance abuse needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Care management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Care manager supervision: After the initial evaluation, the care manager will discuss each&#xD;
      participant and their needs with study PI and team. As indicated, the PI and/or the care&#xD;
      manager will be in contact with study participants via phone after team meetings to monitor&#xD;
      side effects of new medications or for adjustments to the recommended pharmacotherapy plan.&#xD;
      The care manager will receive standard clinical supervision delivered by study members.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up Assessments: Each participant will be contacted to complete a follow-up assessment&#xD;
      at 1-month, 3-months and 6-months after their hospital visit for injury. The follow-up&#xD;
      assessment will be completed in person, over the phone or via internet using the method&#xD;
      preferred by the participant.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adult patients (18-65 years old) presenting to Harborview Medical Center in Seattle,&#xD;
             Washington with an injury from 02/2015 to 09/2015 were screened for eligibility based&#xD;
             on historical codes in the electronic medical record (EMR) that increase their risk&#xD;
             for prescription drug misuse. The items pulled from electronic medical charts for a&#xD;
             pre-screen include: History of opioid, sedative or stimulant abuse or dependence,&#xD;
             history of opioid overdose, current opioid prescriptions, co-occurring prescriptions&#xD;
             for opioids and sedatives, previous ED visit at Harborview Medical Center (HMC)&#xD;
             attributable to substance use, number of ED visits in the past year. Possible&#xD;
             participants who met this eligibility criteria were approached by the research&#xD;
             assistant. Consented patients completed a screening assessment for PDM based on NIDA&#xD;
             m-ASSIST for prescription opioids, sedatives and stimulants and select questions from&#xD;
             the Current Opioid Misuse Measure. Participants with a positive screen for PDM were&#xD;
             enrolled in the 'Prescription Collaborative Care (RxCC)' intervention.&#xD;
