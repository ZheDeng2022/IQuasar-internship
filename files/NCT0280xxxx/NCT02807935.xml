      The purpose of our current series of studies is to evaluate different glaucoma treatments in&#xD;
      vivo effect on the conventional outflow pathway, and specifically on the Schlemm's canal (SC)&#xD;
      anatomy using Enhanced Depth Imaging (EDI)-optical coherence tomography (OCT) . The images&#xD;
      will be taken as part of the patients routine medical follow up (before starting the&#xD;
      treatment, and 1,4 and 12 weeks afterwards) diameter, cross-sectional area and volume will be&#xD;
      measured using commercially available 3-dimensional reconstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The series of studies will be divided into 3 branches, each branch contains different&#xD;
      treatments.For each treatment different patients will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The branches are as following-&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The surgical branch-&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Before and after trabeculotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Before and after cataract surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Before and after vitrectomy surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Before and after XEN™ Gel Stent implant&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The pharmacological branch-&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Before and during the treatment with prostaglandins analogs&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Before and during the treatment with alpha blockers&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Before and during the treatment with beta blockers&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Before and during the treatment with carbonic anhydrase inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The laser branch-&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Before and after trabeculoplasty&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Before and after laser iridotomy&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Before and after yag capsulotomy laser&#xD;
