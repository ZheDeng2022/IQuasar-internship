  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is examining the effects of Retraining and Control Therapy (ReACT; an&#xD;
      intervention focused on changing behaviors and thoughts) for psychogenic non-epileptic&#xD;
      seizures (PNES, episodes resembling epileptic seizures but with no medical explanation).&#xD;
      Participants engage in 8 individual therapy sessions consisting of either cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy or supportive therapy. Healthy control participants also complete&#xD;
      pre-questionnaires and two computer tasks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants come to our laboratory for a total of 11 sessions. During the initial visit,&#xD;
      participants complete several questionnaires assessing demographics, personality style,&#xD;
      relationships with friends and family, as well as past and current PNES symptoms. They also&#xD;
      completed two computer tasks: the magic and turbulence task and a modified Stroop task.&#xD;
      Participants must provide EEG results indicating a diagnosis of psychogenic non-epileptic&#xD;
      seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receive a PNES diary to record all episodes during the course of the study. They&#xD;
      are randomly assigned to either receive ReACT for PNES or supportive therapy, and they return&#xD;
      8 times over the next 8 weeks for therapy sessions. If randomized to ReACT, participants and&#xD;
      a family member learn how to change behaviors and thoughts to address PNES. If randomized to&#xD;
      supportive therapy, they discuss stressors and how they relate to the PNES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures are the same for each therapy group. The first therapy session lasts approximately&#xD;
      90 minutes. All subsequent sessions last about one hour. After completing the 8 therapy&#xD;
      sessions participants return one week later for a follow-up visit lasting approximately one&#xD;
      hour. This visit consists of answering several questionnaires and an interview about current&#xD;
      PNES symptoms. Participants return two months later for a final follow-up visit similar to&#xD;
      the one week follow up visit. Lastly, participants and their parent are called 1 year after&#xD;
      completing treatment and are asked to report PNES frequency over the last 30 days. They are&#xD;
      also asked if they think ReACT was helpful, and if so, what the most helpful part of ReACT&#xD;
      was.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy controls are matched to participants with PNES based on age (+ or - 1 year), gender,&#xD;
      race and family income. They come for 1 laboratory visit to complete the initial visit&#xD;
      questionnaires and computer tasks.&#xD;

    <description>ReACT consists of 8 weekly sessions of therapy focused on teaching adolescents to regain control of their body through managing thoughts and behaviors that reinforce the PNES and return to previous activities. It teaches parents how to respond to PNES in a manner that encourages the adolescents to regain control of their body. The PNES is explained as behaviors learned through classical and operant conditioning .</description>
