  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1, open-label, dose escalation study to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics, and antitumor activity of pixantrone in pediatric patients with relapsed or&#xD;
      refractory solid tumors (excluding those with CNS tumors) or lymphoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately thirty-five eligible patients will receive up to six 28-day cycles of&#xD;
      pixantrone monotherapy, with two additional cycles in patients who continue to benefit from&#xD;
      treatment. Each patient will receive pixantrone administered intravenously on days 1, 8, and&#xD;
      15 of each 28-day cycle. There will be three age cohorts, defined as age cohort 1 (12 to less&#xD;
      than 18 years, plus young adults (ages 18-21 years)), age cohort 2 (5 to less than 12 years),&#xD;
      and age cohort 3 (6 months to less than 5 years). During dose escalation, three patients will&#xD;
      first be accrued to the starting dose level. If no DLTs are identified, that dose level will&#xD;
      be declared to not exceed the MTD and three patients will be accrued to the next higher dose&#xD;
      level. Each subsequent dose-escalation level will be accrued per the DLT/MTD determination&#xD;
      schema above. Planned sequential dose-escalation phase will receive 40 mg/m2, 50 mg/m2, 60&#xD;
      mg/m2 or 70 mg/m2 of pixantrone base (on days 1, 8 and 15), as tolerated, based on DLT&#xD;
      evaluation.Dose escalations will follow a standard 3+3 patient cohort escalation plan. No&#xD;
      patients from Age Cohort 3 will be enrolled until 6 patients from age cohorts 1 and 2&#xD;
      (combined) are evaluable for toxicity. After the MTD has been determined, an expansion phase&#xD;
      will be accrued in order to gain better estimates of the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of pixantrone monotherapy in pediatric patients when treated at the MTD. Patients&#xD;
      will be offered 3 years of post-study extension phase follow-up with periodic assessments of&#xD;
      cardiac function parameters.&#xD;

    <description>Each patient will receive pixantrone monotherapy administered intravenously once on days 1, 8, and 15 up to six 28-day cycles of pixantrone monotherapy, with two additional cycles in patients who continue to benefit from treatment. At least 6 patients each from Age Cohorts 1 and 2 will be accrued into dose escalation cohorts. The study will be opened to patients of Age Cohort 3 only after at least 6 patients in Age Cohorts 1 and 2 (combined) have been evaluated for toxicity. During the dose escalation phase, participants who are inevaluable for DLT for reasons unequivocally unrelated to toxicity will be replaced. Expansion cohort accrual quota-At least 15 evaluable patients treated with the MTD/optimal dose will be accrued in total, of which 7 patients will be in Age Cohort 2.</description>
