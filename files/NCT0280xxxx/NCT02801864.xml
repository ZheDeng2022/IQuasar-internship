      The purpose of this study is to determine if transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      in conjunction with intensive speech therapy will improve sentence production and word&#xD;
      retrieval in individuals with chronic post stroke aphasia.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants from the study will be clients that are enrolled at Austin Speech Labs intensive&#xD;
      speech therapy following the enrollment protocol. A total of six participants will be&#xD;
      enrolled, they will be randomly assigned to sham and real groups. Three of the clients will&#xD;
      receive real and other will receive sham tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to receiving tDCS or speech therapy, the participants' comprehension will be assessed&#xD;
      using the Western Aphasia Battery (WAB). If they have a score of lower than 50%, they will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study. If they receive a score of greater than 50%, they will be asked to&#xD;
      provide verbal and written consent by signing the consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Principal investigator will provide the consent form to both the caregiver and the&#xD;
      participants.If necessary, the investigator will simplify the terminology to ensure&#xD;
      comprehension. The investigator will explain that the purpose of this research intends to&#xD;
      gather data in order to gain scientific knowledge and will not necessarily benefit the&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the experimental group and control group will receive a total of three&#xD;
      hours of therapy. All participants will receive intensive- group, and two hours of individual&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental Group -- Participants will receive tDCS at 1mA for 20min of the total three&#xD;
      hours of intensive speech therapy time at the beginning of each session. Stimulation will be&#xD;
      provided via an electrode using a Starstim device. The anodal electrode will be placed over&#xD;
      inferior frontal gyrus area or the perilesional area, if Broca's area is damaged and the&#xD;
      cathodal electrode will be placed over the contralateral or orbital frontal on the right&#xD;
      hemisphere. For both the Sham and the experimental group the stimulation will be ramped up&#xD;
      for 45 seconds and ramped down for 15 seconds. For the experimental group the stimulation&#xD;
      will be ramped up for 45 seconds and stay there for 20 min while for the sham group it will&#xD;
      ramp down after the initial 45 seconds. The participants will receive three weeks of tDCS and&#xD;
      continue receiving only intensive speech therapy for five weeks for three hours a day.&#xD;
      Intensive speech therapy will continue in order to allow the neurons to be stimulated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group - Participants will receive sham tDCS five days a week for three weeks while&#xD;
      receiving intensive speech therapy. The control group's therapy will follow the same format&#xD;
      as the experimental group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ***In individual and group therapy, the client is not expected to produce a complete sentence&#xD;
      with articles and the correct tense. However, when the clinician is providing feedback and&#xD;
      models, they should produce the sentence using the correct articles and tense.***&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual Therapy: Will be provided for two hours Materials - Verb picture cards (verbs will&#xD;
      be written on the back when necessary), and five Wh question cards- written as &quot;Who&quot; &quot;What&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;Why&quot;, &quot;Where&quot;, and &quot;When&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual therapy will use the VNest framework.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinician will place verb picture card on the table and have the client name the verb.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. If the client cannot name the verb with the picture, the clinician will write the&#xD;
           word on the back of the picture card and the client read it. If the client cannot read&#xD;
           it, the clinician will read it and the client will repeat it. The client will copy the&#xD;
           verb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinician will ask Yes/No questions related to the verb and agent. There will be a set&#xD;
           of 4 questions provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. If time permits at the end of the session, the clinician can generate their own&#xD;
           Yes/No questions after the client has generated agents/objects if the client is done&#xD;
           with the first 4 easily.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The client will complete the phonemic-semantic feature analysis chart for the verb and&#xD;
           produce the verb again.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. If the client cannot generate a response, the clinician will use the response sheet&#xD;
           provided to give a model.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The clinician will present the &quot;Who&quot; card and have the client read the card. The&#xD;
           clinician will then ask the client to generate &quot;Who&quot; (agent) can do the action (verb).&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. If the client cannot generate the agent, the clinician will follow the cueing&#xD;
           hierarchy provided (semantic cue, phonemic cue, two choices, model response).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The Clinician will present the &quot;What&quot; card and have the client read the card. The&#xD;
           clinician will then ask the client to generate &quot;What&quot; (object) the person is doing with&#xD;
           the action (verb).&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. If the client cannot generate the agent, the clinician will follow the cueing&#xD;
           hierarchy provided (semantic cue, phonemic cue, two choices, model response).&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The client will combine the agent, action, and object (SVO).&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If the client cannot generate the phrase, clinician will provide phrase&#xD;
                orthographically and the client will read it. If the client cannot read the phrase,&#xD;
                the clinician will read it and the client will repeat the phrase. The client will&#xD;
                be then asked to copy the phrase and read it.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If the client can combine the words, they will then be asked to write it. If they&#xD;
                cannot write it, the clinician will write it and the client will copy and read it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. The clinician will ask the client three (3) Wh- questions regarding their SVO sentence&#xD;
           generated in step 6. (Who did ____?, What did ____ do?, What did ____ do it with/to?)&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Clinician will then ask the client to generate a sentence, with the same action (verb),&#xD;
           an agent, and object related to their daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If the client cannot generate the sentence, the clinician will use the cueing&#xD;
                hierarchy provided (semantic cue, phonemic cue, two choices, model response).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The client will then be asked to write that sentence and read it aloud.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. If the client cannot write the sentence, the clinician will write it and have the&#xD;
           client copy the sentence. If the client cannot read it, the clinician will read and have&#xD;
           the client repeat it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The client will be shown the EFA &quot;Beach Picture&quot; and be asked to generate a verb&#xD;
           (action) related to the picture and then expand by generating subject (agent) and&#xD;
           object. The client will then be asked to write his/her response. Every session, the&#xD;
           client will be expected to generate a sentence about a different verb.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If the client is unable to generate a sentence, the clinician will model it and the&#xD;
                client will repeat it. If the client is unable to write the sentence, the clinician&#xD;
                will write it and the client will copy it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group Therapy will be for an hour. The participants will work on asking &quot;Wh&quot; questions using&#xD;
      the verbs to the other clients. Also, they will work on naming agents, objects to a given&#xD;
      verb and describe videos shown using complete sentences. The video will be a scene containing&#xD;
      different actions related to the trained verbs. There will be twelve (12) videos used. For&#xD;
      all of the group activities, the clients will alternate turns. The following steps will be&#xD;
      followed in the therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In step one, there will be six (6) total trials. If the client is unable to produce a verbal&#xD;
      response, they should be prompted to write the response first and then produce it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The clinician will show the group a video that shows an action and the client will&#xD;
           generate a sentence describing &quot;Who&quot; (agent) and &quot;What&quot; (object) related to the action.&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. If the client cannot generate a sentence, the other client will attempt to generate a&#xD;
           sentence. If neither client is able to generate a sentence, the clinician will provide a&#xD;
           model.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Once a client is able to generate the &quot;Who&quot; (agent) and &quot;What&quot; (object) with 80%&#xD;
           accuracy with no cueing, the clinician will begin to cue the client to expand the&#xD;
           sentence using &quot;When&quot; and &quot;Where.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be three sets of cards: one with a written verb, one with the picture verb,&#xD;
           and one with wh-questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. One client will pull a written or picture verb card and name the verb. Each client&#xD;
                will use the PSFA chart to generate one attribute about the given verb.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The same client will then pull a wh- question and generate a question using the&#xD;
                wh-question word and the verb.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. If the client is unable to generate a question, the clinician will provide a model&#xD;
           and the client will repeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. The other client will generate an answer to the question. i. If the client is unable&#xD;
           to generate a response, the clinician will provide a model and the client will repeat.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. Both of the clients will write the response (SVO), either the response given in step&#xD;
           c or a new response.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. If the client is unable to write their response, the other client or the clinician&#xD;
           will provide the response and the client will copy it.&#xD;
&#xD;
           e. The clients will then read the response they wrote in step d. f. The client will name&#xD;
           the verb again g. Repeat steps a-f, alternating clients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EVALUATION&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All of the participants will be assessed using the Communicative Effectiveness Index,&#xD;
           the Western Aphasia Battery (part 1), the Boston Naming Test, the Northwestern&#xD;
           Assessment of Verbs and Sentences (excluding the verb naming subtest), and trained and&#xD;
           untrained verb and noun pictures, and trained and untrained verb pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The WAB will be used to determine each participant's type of aphasia and his aphasia&#xD;
           quotient (AQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Each participant's spontaneous speech sample from the subtest on the WAB will be&#xD;
           analyzed. The sample will be analyzed for the number of words in a sentence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In addition, each participant will have a structural pre-scan to understand the lesion&#xD;
           site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The participants will be re-assessed after eight weeks of intervention, three months of&#xD;
           intervention, six months of intervention, and one year of intervention to assess&#xD;
           maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. After the eight weeks of intervention, the participants will continue to receive&#xD;
           treatment if they wish to continue to work on their skills.&#xD;
