  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to evaluate the safety and analgesic efficacy of a single&#xD;
      preoperative intrathecal administration of AYX1 Injection in patients undergoing unilateral&#xD;
      total knee arthroplasty.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, Phase 2, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to&#xD;
      evaluate the safety and efficacy of AYX1 Injection administered intrathecally before surgery&#xD;
      in patients undergoing primary unilateral total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized on the day of surgery to receive either intrathecal AYX1 Injection or intrathecal&#xD;
      placebo just prior to surgery. Study assessments will be conducted during the inpatient&#xD;
      period through 48 hours; follow-up visits will be performed through Study Day 90.&#xD;

             knee from the time of randomization through Day 28&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current neurologic disorder, which could confound the assessment of pain (e.g.,&#xD;
             Parkinson's, Multiple Sclerosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated or inadequately treated (in the opinion of the Investigator) active&#xD;
