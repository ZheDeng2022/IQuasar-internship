    <measure>Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) at 2 Hours Post-dose (Approximately at Tmax)</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Subjects were instructed to drive with steady lateral position between the delineated boundaries of the slower (right) traffic lane, while maintaining a constant speed of 95 kilometers (km) per hour (hr). Deviation was measured by the vehicle's speed and lateral distance to the left lane line and was continuously recorded. Individual improvement was defined as a decrease in SDLP below the negative value of threshold; individual impairment was defined as an increase in SDLP above the threshold or failure to complete the driving test due to sleepiness or subjects related safety concerns.</description>

    <measure>Number of Subjects With Improved or Impaired Driving at a Threshold 1 Centimeter (cm) on JZP-110 Compared to Placebo 2 Hours Post-dose</measure>
    <time_frame>2 hours post-dose</time_frame>
    <description>Individual changes (solriamfetol minus placebo) in driving performance were measured by SDLP at 2 hours postdose. The Maximum McNemar symmetry analyses was used to detect an asymmetry in the distribution of the change in driving performance at 2 hours postdose. The test examined the differences in the proportions of impaired drivers and improved drivers following treatment using a generalized single McNemar test statistics were obtained at each threshold (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 cm), which was the vehicle weaving amount. Changes in SDLP exceeding 2.4 cm have been evaluated as clinically relevant. Improvement was defined as a decrease in SDLP comparing JZP-110 and placebo below the threshold and impairment was defined as an increase in SDLP above the threshold or failure to complete the driving test due to sleepiness or subjects related safety concerns.</description>

        <title>Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) at 2 Hours Post-dose (Approximately at Tmax)</title>
        <description>Subjects were instructed to drive with steady lateral position between the delineated boundaries of the slower (right) traffic lane, while maintaining a constant speed of 95 kilometers (km) per hour (hr). Deviation was measured by the vehicle's speed and lateral distance to the left lane line and was continuously recorded. Individual improvement was defined as a decrease in SDLP below the negative value of threshold; individual impairment was defined as an increase in SDLP above the threshold or failure to complete the driving test due to sleepiness or subjects related safety concerns.</description>

        <title>Number of Subjects With Improved or Impaired Driving at a Threshold 1 Centimeter (cm) on JZP-110 Compared to Placebo 2 Hours Post-dose</title>
        <description>Individual changes (solriamfetol minus placebo) in driving performance were measured by SDLP at 2 hours postdose. The Maximum McNemar symmetry analyses was used to detect an asymmetry in the distribution of the change in driving performance at 2 hours postdose. The test examined the differences in the proportions of impaired drivers and improved drivers following treatment using a generalized single McNemar test statistics were obtained at each threshold (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 cm), which was the vehicle weaving amount. Changes in SDLP exceeding 2.4 cm have been evaluated as clinically relevant. Improvement was defined as a decrease in SDLP comparing JZP-110 and placebo below the threshold and impairment was defined as an increase in SDLP above the threshold or failure to complete the driving test due to sleepiness or subjects related safety concerns.</description>

        <description>Individual changes (solriamfetol minus placebo) in driving performance were measured by SDLP at 2 hours postdose. The Maximum McNemar symmetry analyses was used to detect an asymmetry in the distribution of the change in driving performance at 2 hours postdose. The test examined the differences in the proportions of impaired drivers and improved drivers following treatment using a generalized single McNemar test statistics were obtained at each threshold (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 cm), which was the vehicle weaving amount. Changes in SDLP exceeding 2.4 cm have been evaluated as clinically relevant. Improvement was defined as a decrease in SDLP comparing JZP-110 and placebo below the threshold and impairment was defined as an increase in SDLP above the threshold or failure to complete the driving test due to sleepiness or subjects related safety concerns.</description>

The test examined the differences in the proportions of impaired drivers and improved drivers following treatment using a generalized single McNemar test statistics were obtained at each threshold (1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, 3.0, and 3.5 cm), which was the vehicle weaving amount. Changes in SDLP exceeding 2.4 cm have been evaluated as clinically relevant. Improvement was defined as a decrease in SDLP comparing JZP-110 and placebo below the threshold and impairment was defined as an increase in SDLP above the threshold or failure to complete the driving test due to sleepiness or subjects related safety concerns.</description>

        <description>The PVT was administered at screening for practice only, and at predose and within 30 minutes before each driving test on Days 7 and 14 (Visits 4 and 5, respectively). The test was administered over 10 minutes with visual stimuli appearing randomly at variable intervals of 2 to 10 seconds. Subjects were instructed to respond to the appearance of a visual stimulus on a computer screen by pushing a response button as quickly as possible. Mean RT is measured in msec.</description>
