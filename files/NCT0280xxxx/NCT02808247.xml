  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicentric, randomized, open label Phase II trial investigating&#xD;
      whether the oral angiogenesis inhibitor nintedanib, as compared to the intravenous cytotoxic&#xD;
      compound ifosfamide, given for patients with advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic STS after&#xD;
      failure of first line chemotherapy prolongs progression-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the trial is to evaluate whether nintedanib given as second-line&#xD;
      therapy for advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic STS prolongs progression-free survival&#xD;
      when compared with ifosfamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are to evaluate the efficacy of nintedanib as compared to ifosfamide in&#xD;
      terms of progression-free survival rate at 12 weeks, overall survival, objective response&#xD;
      rate, patient benefit rate, response duration, total duration of treatment with nintedanib&#xD;
      safety, Health related Quality of Life and Health Economics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory objectives include an analysis of putative predictive biomarkers for the&#xD;
      anti-tumor effects of the investigational agent nintedanib.treatment.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For STS where no established grading system exists, or sarcoma subtypes which are very&#xD;
             indolent or have an unpredictable clinical behavior, patient entry requires&#xD;
             prospective approval in writing, on a case-by-case basis by the Study Coordinator of&#xD;
             this trial and EORTC Headquarters (HQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Representative formalin fixed, paraffin embedded tumor blocks or unstained tissue&#xD;
             slides, either from the primary tumor or a metastatic lesion, must be available for&#xD;
             histological central review. Histological central review is not required before&#xD;
             treatment start but it is mandatory to send unstained tumor slides (blocks optional)&#xD;
             at time of study entry. Local histopathological diagnosis will be accepted for entry&#xD;
             into this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior to study enrolment, all patients need to have confirmed RECIST 1.1 disease&#xD;
             progression based on local investigator's assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of measurable disease according to RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Tumor lesions situated in a previously irradiated area, or in an area subjected to&#xD;
             other loco-regional therapy, are considered non-measurable unless there has been&#xD;
             demonstrated progression (20 % increase) in the assessed lesion since the local&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No radiographic evidence of cavitary lesions (either primary tumor or metastatic&#xD;
             lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No centrally located tumors with radiographic evidence of local invasion of major&#xD;
             blood vessels.&#xD;

             with radiotherapy, symptomatic, requiring treatment with anti-convulsants;&#xD;
             dexamethasone therapy will be allowed if administered as stable dose for at least one&#xD;
             month before randomization).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  One (and no less or more than one) line of previous systemic chemotherapy for&#xD;
             advanced, inoperable and/or metastatic malignant STS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior neoadjuvant, adjuvant and or first-line maintenance systemic chemotherapy for&#xD;
             locally advanced or metastatic STS is allowed and does count as zero lines of&#xD;
             treatment, provided that the disease did not progress during neoadjuvant and/or&#xD;
             adjuvant therapy or within 12 weeks after completion of the perioperative treatment.&#xD;
             In case the disease progressed during neoadjuvant, adjuvant and or first-line&#xD;
             maintenance systemic chemotherapy or within 12 weeks after its completion, the&#xD;
             treatment is counted as one line and the patient can theoretically participate in the&#xD;
             trial, provided all other selection criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;

             failure rate (i.e. less than 1% per year) when used consistently and correctly. Since&#xD;
             the effect of nintedanib on the metabolism and efficacy of contraceptives has not been&#xD;
             investigated, barrier methods should be applied as a second form of contraception, to&#xD;
             avoid pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects who are breast feeding should discontinue nursing prior to&#xD;
             randomization and until 6 months after the last study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

             condom) during the study treatment period and for at least 3 months after the last&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Before patient registration/randomization, written informed consent must be obtained&#xD;
             according to international conference on harmonisation/Good clinical practice&#xD;
             (ICH/GCP) and national/local regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients can only be randomized in this trial once. Important note: All eligibility&#xD;
             criteria must be adhered to, in case of potential deviation a discussion with EORTC&#xD;
             Headquarters and study coordinator is mandatory.&#xD;
