  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to to assess the safety and tolerability of pirfenidone 2403&#xD;
      mg/day for the treatment of RA-associated interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled trial of pirfenidone for the&#xD;
      treatment of RA associated interstitial lung disease. Approximately 270 subjects will be&#xD;
      randomized to receive Pirfenidone 2403 mg per day or placebo in a 1:1 ratio. The primary&#xD;
      outcome of this study is to assess the efficacy of pirfenidone 2403 mg/day versus placebo in&#xD;
      patients with RA associated interstitial lung disease, as defined by progression free&#xD;
      survival over the 52 weeks of treatment. Patients will receive blinded study treatment from&#xD;
      the time of randomization until the Week 52 Visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients aged 18 to 85 years must meet 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria for RA (Aletaha,&#xD;
      Neogi et al. 2010) as well as RA-associated ILD, as determined by imaging and, when&#xD;
      available, lung biopsy. Patients will be required to have a % predicted FVC ≥40 and %&#xD;
      predicted DLCO or TLCO ≥30 at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dose of study treatment will be titrated over 14 days. Patients will receive a telephone&#xD;
      assessment at Weeks 1 and 2, and visit the clinic at Weeks 4, 8, 13, 19, 26, 39, and 52.&#xD;
      Subjects will have a follow up phone call 28 days after completion of the study drug.&#xD;
      Patients should complete a compliance diary between visits. If patients discontinue study&#xD;
      treatment for any reason before the end of the study, they should continue with all scheduled&#xD;
      study procedures through Week 52. If subjects are unable to complete the study visits as&#xD;
      scheduled, all efforts should be made to complete an early termination visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome variable of this study will be progression free survival, defined as&#xD;
      progression free from decline in FVC of 10% or greater during the 52 week study period.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>

&#xD;
          2. Probable or definite diagnosis of RA according to revised 2010 ACR/EULAR criteria,&#xD;
             without evidence or suspicion of an alternative diagnosis that may contribute to their&#xD;
             interstitial lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of ILD&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. supported by clinically indicated HRCT, and when available, surgical lung biopsy&#xD;
                  (SLB), prior to Screening, and&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. presence of fibrotic abnormality affecting more than 10% of the lung parenchyma,&#xD;
                  with or without traction bronchiectasis or honeycombing, on screening and&#xD;
                  confirmed by adjudicated HRCT prior to Baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. No features supporting an alternative diagnosis on transbronchial biopsy, or SLB, if&#xD;
             performed prior to Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Attainment of the following centralized spirometry criteria (based on local spirometry&#xD;
             on standardized equipment and centralized quality controlled):&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. percent predicted FVC ≥ 40% at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. change in pre-bronchodilator FVC (measured in liters) between Visit 1 (Screening)&#xD;
                  and Visit 2 (Randomization) must be a &lt;10% relative difference, calculated as:&#xD;
                  100% * [absolute value (Visit 1 FVC - Visit 2 FVC) / Visit 1 FVC]&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. percent predicted DLCO or TLCO ≥25 % at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
               4. Screening (Visit 1) pre-bronchodilator(BD) and Post-BD spirometry meets ATS&#xD;
                  quality criteria as determined by a central reviewer&#xD;
&#xD;
               5. Baseline (Visit 2) Pre-BD spirometry meets ATS quality criteria as determined by&#xD;
                  the site Investigator or the central reviewer&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Able to understand and sign a written informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use two adequate methods of contraception, including at&#xD;
             least one method with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year, during the 52 week treatment&#xD;
             period and for at least 118 days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal,&#xD;
                  has not reached a postmenopausal state (≥ 12 continuous months of amenorrhea with&#xD;
                  no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt;1% per year include&#xD;
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, established and proper use of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraceptives that inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine&#xD;
                  devices, and copper intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  postovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. For men who are not surgically sterile: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive measures, and agreement to refrain from&#xD;
             donating sperm, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. With female partners of childbearing potential, men must remain abstinent or use&#xD;
                  a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together result in a&#xD;
                  failure rate of &lt; 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 118&#xD;
                  days after the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Men must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
