      REWARD is an Non Interventional study aims to describe the changes in the clinical outcomes&#xD;
      of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus patients who are treated with Dapagliflozin for a period of one&#xD;
      year including the fasting period of Ramadan&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REWARD is a multi-center, post-authorization, prospective, open label, non-interventional,&#xD;
      real-life, observational, cohort study. The study is to be conducted at 10-15 sites .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims to describe the changes in the clinical outcomes over 1 year as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To describe the change in HbAlc from baseline as a parameter for blood glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To describe the changes from baseline in the following parameters:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Total cholesterol, LDL-C, non-HDL-C and triglycerides.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Systolic and Diastolic Blood Pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Other Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To capture the frequency &amp; incidence of the following reported adverse events :&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hypoglycemic episodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Volume Depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Genital infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urinary tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exploratory Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To describe the combined effect of the hot climate season and fasting Ramadan on the level of&#xD;
      total ketone bodies levels in T2DM subjects treated with Dapagliflozin.Description of outcome&#xD;
      variables in relation to objectives and hypotheses&#xD;

    <description>Quantitative estimation of capillary ketone bodies will be carried out within 3-months prior Ramadan in selected centers where this is a routine clinic practice. In patients where quantitative estimation of capillary ketone bodies was measured prior to Ramadan, another measurement will be carried out during Ramadan if the date of patient routine follow-up visit coincided with the month of Ramadan. In case visit coincides with only a couple of days of fasting, measurements would be taken into the middle and/or the end of Ramadan. In case someone is recruited during Ramadan, baseline recorded measurements must be prior to Ramadan</description>
