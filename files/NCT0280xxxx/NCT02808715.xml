      Chinese male subjects will be invited to participate in a research study of brown fat, a&#xD;
      special tissue in the body that is designed to burn energy to make heat. The objective is to&#xD;
      learn the importance of a gene called &quot;PRDM-16&quot; for the function of brown fat. Subjects were&#xD;
      selected as a possible subject in this study because they fulfil the age and weight criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      500 subjects from the Singhealth Investigational Medicine Unit healthy volunteer database&#xD;
      will be recruited over a period of 2 years. All of the subjects will have their PRDM-16 gene&#xD;
      sequenced. The objective is to identify subjects with mutations, or changes, in their PRDM-16&#xD;
      gene. About 12 subjects with PRDM-16 mutations are expected to be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples of blood obtained during the course of this study will be stored and analysed only&#xD;
      for the purposes of this study for a period not exceeding 2 years, and will be destroyed&#xD;
      after completion of the study, unless subject is agreeable to donate the samples to the&#xD;
      National Heart Centre Singapore for continuous storage for future studies that are approved&#xD;
      by the institutional review board..&#xD;

      The long-term objective of this study is to develop new treatments for obesity and&#xD;
      obesity-associated disorders such as diabetes and dyslipidemia. The recent finding of active&#xD;
      brown fat depots in adult humans provides an exciting new strategy for the treatment of these&#xD;
      diseases. Brown fat is a specialized organ found primarily in small mammals. Brown fat has&#xD;
      the unique capability to burn fuel at high rates in order to generate heat. The role of brown&#xD;
      fat in mammals is to defend against cold exposure. Human infants have active brown fat&#xD;
      deposits located in the intra-scapular region. This brown fat depot regresses with age and it&#xD;
      was long thought that adult humans had no brown fat tissue. Recent studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      the presence of brown fat activity in adult humans following exposure to cold. Brown fat in&#xD;
      adult humans is concentrated in the cervical region and displays some sex-specific&#xD;
      differences. Furthermore the size of the depot is inversely correlated with BMI and age of&#xD;
      the subjects. This finding has generated intense interest as it opens up the possibility of&#xD;
      harnessing brown fat as a means of combating obesity and obesity-related disorders in man.&#xD;
      Indeed, maneuvers that activate brown fat in humans have been shown to cause reductions in&#xD;
      fat mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Much of our understanding of brown fat biology comes from work in mice. Of particular&#xD;
      relevance for the treatment of human disease are several findings. First, increasing brown&#xD;
      fat activity in mice renders the animals resistant to the development of obesity on a high&#xD;
      fat diet. Second, levels of insulin sensitivity are directly related to brown fat activity.&#xD;
      Finally, the transcription factor factor PR-domain containing protein 16 (PRDM-16) is crucial&#xD;
      for directing the biology of brown fat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of the study is to translate the findings from mouse studies of brown fat&#xD;
      into human subjects. This is an important first step in the process of developing brown&#xD;
      fat-targeted therapies to treat human metabolic diseases such as obesity and insulin&#xD;
      resistance. In view of this the investigators are interested in answering several questions.&#xD;
      First, do humans with mutations in PRDM-16 have defects in brown fat activity? Recently,&#xD;
      humans with mutations in PRDM-16 were identified and found to have a cardiomyopathy&#xD;
      phenotype. The brown fat function in these individuals has not been described. By employing a&#xD;
      genetic screen of volunteers the investigators hope to identify subjects in Singapore with&#xD;
      defects in PRDM-16. Prior studies in humans suggest that the size of the brown fat depot is&#xD;
      inversely correlated with BMI and age of the subjects and that depot size varies between the&#xD;
      sexes. In order to eliminate BMI, age and sex as confounding variables the investigators will&#xD;
      include male subjects of Chinese race between the ages of 21 and 50 and with BMI greater than&#xD;
      18.5 but less than 30. The investigators will include only Chinese subjects to avoid&#xD;
      confounding our initial study with variables that relate to race of the subjects. The&#xD;
      identification of human subjects carrying mutations in PRDM-16 will set the stage for further&#xD;
      studies that will attempt to several research questions. These include whether humans with&#xD;
      PRDM-16 mutations have defects in brown fat and the metabolic consequences for humans with&#xD;
      defective brown fat.&#xD;

    <description>Blood draw #1 Site of blood draw: IMU Volume of blood: 20mL Purpose of blood draw: Isolation of genomic DNA Site of storage: NHRIS biobank Coding: Specimens will be identified using a research ID that will be affixed to samples using bar-coding. After the blood is collected, stored the blood at 4 degree Celsius and contact the NHCS biobank coordinator to collect the blood samples. The blood samples must be collected within 1 hour of collection.</description>

      A blood sample will be obtained and processed to isolate genomic DNA. A PCR-based strategy&#xD;
      will be employed to sequence the entire PRDM-16 locus to identify variants. Variant alleles&#xD;
      of PRDM-16 will be classified as having benign or deleterious mutations. Subjects who harbor&#xD;
      deleterious mutations in both alleles of PRDM-16 will be identified for further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects who withdraw from the study, no further testing of the blood samples will occur.&#xD;
      The blood will be stored at the NHRIS biobank. After the study is complete the samples will&#xD;
      remain in storage at the NHRIS biobank.&#xD;

        500 subjects will be recruited from the IMU healthy volunteer database. The investigators&#xD;
        will enroll male Chinese volunteers. Women, children and the elderly are excluded from our&#xD;
        initial study since prior research suggests that age and sex has an effect on brown fat&#xD;
        function. In order to study the role of PRDM-16 in brown fat function the investigators&#xD;
        wish to keep other contributing variables static in our study.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chinese&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age &gt;= 21 and =&lt; 50&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  BMI &gt;=18.5 and =&lt; 30&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to provide written, informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  To control for this the investigators will include only adult Chinese men less than 50&#xD;
             years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since obesity also alters brown fat function the investigators will exclude those with&#xD;
             BMI&gt;30.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of DM2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of beta blockers, TZD (ie rosiglitazone/pioglitazone) or metformin Since the&#xD;
             subjects will be recruited from the IMU healthy volunteer database there should be no&#xD;
             prior history of DM2 or medication use. Nevertheless, diagnosis of DM2 and use of the&#xD;
             drugs listed can alter brown fat activity and interfere with our analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of pacemakers or foreign metallic objects in the eyes. Future planned&#xD;
             experiments with the identified cohort include cardiac MRI. Subjects with pacemakers&#xD;
             or foreign metallic objects in the eyes will be ineligible for this potential&#xD;
             follow-up study.&#xD;
