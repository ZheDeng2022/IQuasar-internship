      The study will be split into 2 parts, Part 1, ( A and B), and Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1A Part 1A of the study will be a single centre, open label, 2-way crossover in healthy&#xD;
      male and female volunteers and will assess the relative bioavailability of a single 360 mg&#xD;
      dose (as 3 x 120mg tablets) of F901318 IR tablet formulation in comparison to a 360 mg dose&#xD;
      of an SDD suspension for oral dosing. It is planned that 10 volunteers will be enrolled to&#xD;
      Part 1A of the study. These 10 subjects will continue into Part 1B of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a minimum washout of 10 days between doses provided to volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Part 1A there will be a two week period of interim analysis during which safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data will be reviewed. In order to assess doses within the therapeutic range&#xD;
      in Part 1B, a decision will be made using the available data, on whether the dose of F901318&#xD;
      IR tablet formulation should be altered. Dose will be altered by amending the number of units&#xD;
      dosed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1B Following the dose decision meeting where data obtained in Part 1A of the study is&#xD;
      reviewed, the selected dose of F901318 IR tablet formulation will be assessed in a further&#xD;
      single centre, open label, 2-way crossover in healthy male and female volunteers. The&#xD;
      selected dose will be administered in the fed (30 minutes following an FDA high fat meal) and&#xD;
      fasted states in a randomised fashion. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a minimum washout of 10 days between doses provided to volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following Part 1B there will period a period of interim analysis during which safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic data will be reviewed. In order to assess doses within the therapeutic range&#xD;
      in Part 2, a decision will be made using the available data, on the dose of F901318 IR&#xD;
      formulation to be dosed in Part 2. Dose will be altered by amending the number of units&#xD;
      dosed. It will also be determined if doses in Part 2 will be administered in the fed or&#xD;
      fasted state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2 In part 2, the dose(s) anticipated to yield therapeutic plasma concentrations will be&#xD;
      tested over a 10-day period. This will be a double blind placebo controlled, randomised,&#xD;
      parallel group design in 10 healthy male and female subjects, 8 taking active compound and 2&#xD;
      taking placebo. In order to mimic the expected treatment schedule in phase 2 trials, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that there will be a loading dose given over 1 or 2 days, followed by once daily&#xD;
      or twice daily doses of study drug up to a total of 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both parts of the study, blood will be drawn for safety and pharmacokinetic evaluation.&#xD;
      Adverse events, vital signs and 12 lead ECGs will be monitored throughout. In Part 1, Holter&#xD;
      monitoring will be performed for 12 hours after each dose. Part 2, ECG Holter monitoring will&#xD;
      be performed on Days 1 and 10 only.&#xD;
