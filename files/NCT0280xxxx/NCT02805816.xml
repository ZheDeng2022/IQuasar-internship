      The investigators will perform prospective observational multicenter study which includes&#xD;
      children with suspicion of CD who referred to gastroscopy and intestinal biopsies (study&#xD;
      group) and children without suspicion of CD who underwent gastroscopy for other reasons. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of several&#xD;
      serological kits of TG2 (tissue transglutaminase) (Bioplex 2200, Bioflash, Phadia 250,&#xD;
      Liason-XL, Orgentec Alergia and Eurospital) compared with definitive diagnosis of CD&#xD;
      according to histological findings.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Small bowel biopsies have so far been considered as the reference standard for the diagnosis&#xD;
      of Celiac disease (CD). However, during the last decades evidence has accumulated on the&#xD;
      diagnostic value of specific CD antibodies and has increasingly been used for diagnostic&#xD;
      purposes. At the same time, the leading role of histology for the diagnosis of CD has been&#xD;
      questioned for several reasons: histological findings are not specific for CD, lesions may be&#xD;
      patchy and can occur in the duodenal bulb only and interpretation depends on preparation of&#xD;
      the tissue and is prone to a high inter-observer variability. The diagnosis of CD may then&#xD;
      depend not only on the results of small bowel biopsies, but also on information from clinical&#xD;
      data and on results from specific CD antibody testing. ESPGHAN (European Society of&#xD;
      Gastroenterology, Hepatology and Nutrition) guidelines for the diagnosis of CD which was&#xD;
      recently published enabled diagnosis of CD based on classical symptoms and high titre levels&#xD;
      (&gt;10 times upper limit of normal) of tissue transglutaminase (TG2) and positive Endomysial&#xD;
      Anti bodies (EMA) in separate blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to these facts, it is important to use serological kit for TG2 with high specificity and&#xD;
      sensitivity. The aim of this study is to assess in a prospective study the kit with the&#xD;
      highest sensitivity and specificity among patients with suspected CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will perform prospective observational multicenter study which includes&#xD;
      children with suspicion of CD who referred to gastroscopy and intestinal biopsies (study&#xD;
      group) and children without suspicion of CD who underwent gastroscopy for other reasons. The&#xD;
      investigators will compare sensitivity, specificity and predictive values of several&#xD;
      serological kits of TG2 (Bioplex 2200, Bioflash, Phadia 250, Liason-XL, Orgentec Alergia and&#xD;
      Eurospital) compared with definitive diagnosis of CD according to histological findings.&#xD;
