  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) often starts with short episodes of rapid irregular heartbeats that&#xD;
      are only detected by implanted pacemakers or defibrillators. Usually people don't know that&#xD;
      they have these episodes. Over time, these episodes can happen more often and last for longer&#xD;
      periods. In some people, the heart eventually remains permanently in a fast irregular rhythm,&#xD;
      known as atrial fibrillation. This condition can lead to strokes and blood clots. If&#xD;
      physicians could detect atrial fibrillation at a very early stage they could treat people&#xD;
      early and possibly prevent the condition from becoming permanent. People with implanted&#xD;
      devices allow a unique opportunity to constantly monitor the heart rhythm so investigators&#xD;
      can detect any irregularities immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators don't know which people are at risk of developing short episodes of fast&#xD;
      irregular heartbeats that can lead to atrial fibrillation. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      find out if there are proteins or chemical changes in the blood that can predict the risk of&#xD;
      developing atrial fibrillation. These chemical changes, also known as biomarkers, may also be&#xD;
      able to give investigators other clues about atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is considered to be a progressive condition that starts with&#xD;
      episodes of paroxysmal AF (short runs of AF), progresses to persistent AF (can be reverted to&#xD;
      normal rhythm) and eventually to permanent AF. More than 25% of people with paroxysmal AF&#xD;
      will go on to develop persistent or chronic atrial fibrillation. The progression rate is&#xD;
      around 5% per annum. AF can result in devastating outcomes such as stroke/TIA and systemic&#xD;
      embolic events. In people with implanted devices such as ICDs, investigators can detect&#xD;
      non-symptomatic rapid atrial arrhythmia, known as subclinical atrial fibrillation (SCAF),&#xD;
      before it becomes symptomatic. In the ASSERT trial, SCAF was detected in 10% of patients with&#xD;
      newly implanted devices within the first 3 months. Of these, nearly 16% developed clinical&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation within 2.5 years vs 3% in those who did not exhibit SCAF within the first&#xD;
      3 months. During the follow up period, a further 24.5% of patients developed SCAF. People&#xD;
      with SCAF also had a higher risk of stroke and systemic embolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Earlier diagnosis and treatment of AF may lead to better prevention and outcomes. The&#xD;
      availability of serum based biomarkers that can predict the early onset of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, may help in the identification of patients at risk for developing AF early.&#xD;
      This would also allow the identification of the patient population most suitable for the&#xD;
      evaluation of possible future intervention strategies to prevent the onset of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, and alter its natural history and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study investigators will study patients that have a new permanent pacemaker or&#xD;
      defibrillator implanted. These devices continuously monitor the patient's heart rhythm,&#xD;
      detecting any irregularities. Patients with these devices are followed up in outpatient&#xD;
      clinics on a regular basis. The information from the devices is downloaded at each follow up&#xD;
      visit and analyzed by staff in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators will recruit patients for this study 4 weeks after the device was implanted.&#xD;
      After obtaining consent, investigators will collect a blood sample for measuring biomarkers.&#xD;
      They will interview the participant in regards to previous health history, smoking, alcohol&#xD;
      consumption, family history and current medications. Investigators will measure the blood&#xD;
      pressure and heart rate. After one year when the participant returns for a clinical follow up&#xD;
      visit, another blood sample will be drawn for biomarkers. Any irregular heart rhythms that&#xD;
      were detected on the implanted device will be recorded. Investigators will also ask the&#xD;
      participant in regards to any illnesses and hospitalizations during the past year.&#xD;
      Participants' medical records will be reviewed annually for the next 10 years, to monitor for&#xD;
      any irregular heart rhythms, hospitalizations and death.&#xD;
