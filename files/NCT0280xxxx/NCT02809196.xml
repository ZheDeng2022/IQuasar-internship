    <textblock>
      The overall objective is to examine if participating in an SMS-transmitted health educational&#xD;
      program targeting a cluster of dietary factors over a period of weeks during the years of&#xD;
      adolescence can induce durable changes towards more healthful dietary habits. The&#xD;
      investigators will examine if impact is reinforced by asking a friend of the participant to&#xD;
      also participate; if impact is reinforced by asking the mother of the participant to also&#xD;
      participate; and if impact is reinforced when the SMS-transmitted health promotion program is&#xD;
      designed to target a specific dietary factor only - decided upon from participants' reporting&#xD;
      of their dietary habits at the beginning of the program - rather than to simultaneously&#xD;
      target a cluster of dietary issues uniform for all participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Groups of adolescents from the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC) will be offered to&#xD;
      participate in the health educational programs. At 14 years and 14 years plus 3 months all&#xD;
      children DNBC are invited to report comprehensively on their dietary and physical activity&#xD;
      habits by means of a web-based questionnaire (FFQ). Eligible DNBC adolescents for the&#xD;
      SMS-educational program will be invited among those who have completed the FFQ. Thus, once&#xD;
      they have completed the DNBC FFQ, they may be invited to participate in the SMS-based&#xD;
      educational programs, either addressing only one of the three target factors: sugar sweetened&#xD;
      beverages, fruit &amp; vegetables, or fish (SSB, F&amp;V, or Fish) or addressing all three factors&#xD;
      (cluster). The adolescents may also potentially be invited to include a friend, their mother&#xD;
      or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial Organization:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sjurdur F Olsen, MD PhD, Lead Principal Investigator (Responsible Party), SSI&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Eric Ding, ScD, Co-PI, Harvard TH Chan School of Public Health&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Daniel Zoughbie, Co-PI, Epidemic Health Inc&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design for Inviting Adolescents to Educational Program: The study will be conducted&#xD;
      corresponding to a '2x2x2 factorial plus 1' design, with 9 arms. In addition to allowing&#xD;
      testing of the effect of participating in an SMS based educational program as compared to not&#xD;
      participating in such program, this will allow for additional testing of effect of&#xD;
      implicating a friend v. not implicating friend; of implicating the mother v. not implicating&#xD;
      the mother; and of delivering tailored messaging targeting only one of the three dietary&#xD;
      factors (SSB, F&amp;V, or Fish) v. delivering uniform messaging targeting all three factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the tailored program, the participants will receive messages distributed over 4 weeks,&#xD;
      whereas in the FULL program (addressing all three clusters) messages are distributed over 12&#xD;
      weeks. Messages can be divided into five categories: Information, quizzes, tips, challenges,&#xD;
      and reminders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses to tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Overall effect. Hypothesis 1: SMS messaging will improve dietary habits 1a) tailored 1b)&#xD;
           non- tailored&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Effect of including a friend. Hypothesis 2: Including a friend will increase above&#xD;
           effects 2a) tailored 2b) non- tailored&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Effect of including the mother. Hypothesis 3: Including the mother will increase above&#xD;
           effects 3a) tailored 3b) non- tailored&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Effect of tailored program v. a cluster of factors. Hypothesis 4: A tailored program&#xD;
           will be more efficient than a full program in changing specific outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For testing this hypothesis, which addresses one of the three specific, tailored programs&#xD;
      (underlined below), eligible adolescents will be stratified into four strata depending on&#xD;
      their FFQ response:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 1: Nearly all participants have a low intake of fish; whereas there will be no&#xD;
      problem with sugar sweetened beverages and no problem with fruit and vegetables. Tailored&#xD;
      program AND outcome measure to be tested: FISH / fish intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 2: All participants have problems with fruit and vegetables, and no problems with&#xD;
      sugar sweetened beverages, but (NB!), like in stratum 1, nearly all have a problem with fish.&#xD;
      Tailored program AND outcome measure to be tested: F&amp;V / intake fruit and vegetable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 3: All participants have problems with sugar sweetened beverages; whereas nearly all&#xD;
      will have NO problem with fruit and vegetables. Nearly all have a problem with Fish&#xD;
      (986/1195). Tailored program AND outcome measure to be tested: SSB / intake of sugar&#xD;
      sweetened beverages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 4: All participants have a problem with sugar sweetened beverages, fruit and&#xD;
      vegetables and fish. Tailored program AND outcome measure to be tested: FISH / fish intake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strata 1 &amp; 4 can be aggregated and, when effect on fish intake is tested, a test for&#xD;
      interaction by intake of sugar sweetened beverages or by intake of fruit and vegetables can&#xD;
      be made.&#xD;
