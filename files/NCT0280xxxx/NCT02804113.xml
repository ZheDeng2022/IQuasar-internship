  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The VMI-CFA study investigates the efficacy of the Supera Stent in the treatment of common&#xD;
      femoral artery stenosis or occlusion. 100 patients will be included with a RF of 2 to 4. The&#xD;
      lesion is located within the native CFA and treated with predillation prior to stenting with&#xD;
      the Supera Peripheral Stent System. Patients will be invited for a follow-up visit at 1, 6,&#xD;
      12 and 24 month post procedure. The primary endpoint of the study is the primary patency at&#xD;
      12 months and periprocedural events up to 30 days post procedure. Secondary endpoints include&#xD;
      technical success, primary patency rate at 1, 6 and 24 month, freedom from TLR at 1-, 6-, 12&#xD;
      and 24 month follow-up and clinical success at 1-, 6-, 12- and 24-month follow-up.&#xD;
