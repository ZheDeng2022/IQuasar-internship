      The purpose of this study is to understand how the opioid system is involved in eating&#xD;
      behavior.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is associated with greater risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD), stroke, diabetes,&#xD;
      and mortality, and is a heterogeneous condition with various causes and thus a diversity of&#xD;
      intervention targets. Compulsive overeating afflicts 30% of people seeking obesity treatment&#xD;
      and increases risk for CVD factors. This trial involves two participant visits to test&#xD;
      whether opioid blockade (Day 1 or 2, depending on randomization), compared to placebo (Day 1&#xD;
      or 2, depending on randomization), will elicit common symptoms of opioid withdrawal,&#xD;
      including nausea. Participants will receive each condition on separate days.&#xD;

    <description>Dichotomized response on the &quot;I feel nauseous&quot; question of the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale, at 10 minutes after the listed intervention (among participants who completed both intervention visits). Response 0 = absence of nausea, 1 = presence of nausea.</description>

    <description>Summed score of Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS). Scale consists of 16 items answered on a 5 point numeric rating scale. Score range is 0 (lesser withdrawal symptoms) to 64 (greater withdrawal symptoms). Scores were assessed at 10 minutes after Naloxone, and at a separate visit, 10 minutes after Placebo, among participants who completed both study visits.</description>

    <time_frame>30 minutes post-treatment</time_frame>
    <description>Mean score on subset of 5 items (which used a 5 point numeric rating response scale) from the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS). This summed score can range from 0 (corresponding to lesser withdrawal symptoms) to 20 (corresponding to greater withdrawal symptoms).</description>

    <measure>Reward-Driven Eating Scale (RED)</measure>
    <time_frame>Evaluated before study visit 1</time_frame>

    <measure>Impulsivity (Delayed Discounting)</measure>
    <time_frame>Impulsivity was assessed before the study visit 1 intervention.</time_frame>
    <description>Impulsivity, measured by the Delayed Discounting cognitive task, based on a series of 30 computer-administered trials or questions. Indifference points (a measure of how much a person values a delayed reward) are determined for time delays of: 1 day, 7 days, 30 days, 180 days, and 365 days, and these are used to calculate an Area Under the Curve which ranges from 0 to 1 (lower numbers indicate higher impulsivity) as a metric of probability.</description>
