    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is associated with impaired stroke recovery. Treatment with&#xD;
      continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) may prevent this but is limited by poor adherence.&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators enrolled eligible stroke patients undergoing inpatient&#xD;
      rehabilitation (IPR) into an intensive CPAP adherence protocol (iCAP) with an aim to increase&#xD;
      tolerance and adherence to auto-titrating CPAP (APAP).&#xD;

      The SCOUTS (Stroke and CPAP Outcome Study 2) was a single-arm, open-label study performed at&#xD;
      2 IPR units of the University of Washington. Eligible stroke patients undergoing IPR were&#xD;
      provided an intensive CPAP adherence protocol (iCAP) to increase tolerance and adherence to&#xD;
      auto-titrating CPAP (APAP). The iCAP included patient education and encouragement, device&#xD;
      adjustments, close monitoring of adherence and a 3-night run-in period of APAP to identify&#xD;
      those patients who 1. have OSA and 2. have APAP tolerance-- defined as participant&#xD;
      willingness to continue APAP during IPR and over the 3-month treatment period. If both&#xD;
      criteria were met, APAP treatment with iCAP continued during the rehabilitation stay and over&#xD;
      a 3-month period. The goal of the intervention was to achieve 50% of subjects meeting APAP&#xD;
      adherence (an average ≥ 4 hours per night) over the 3-month treatment period. The&#xD;
      investigators evaluated if demographic, co-morbid or stroke-specific factors predicted APAP&#xD;
      adherence and assessed the relationship between APAP adherence and neurological recovery from&#xD;
      stroke.&#xD;

    <description>Change in the cognitive subscale of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) over 3 months. The FIM, a disability scale measuring the burden of care associated with aspects of motor and cognitive function, includes a motor and cognitive component. The cognitive subscale includes 5 cognitive items: comprehension, expression, social interaction, problem solving and memory. Each of the 5 cognitive items are scored from 1 (complete dependence) to 7 (complete independence). The total scores from these 5 items for the cognitive subscale range from 5 to 35 with lower scores indicating greater functional disability. The 5 items from the cognitive subscale are combined with 13 items from the motor subscale yielding the 18 items of the total FIM with a minimum score of 18 and a maximum score of 126 with lower scores indicating greater functional disability.</description>

    <description>Participants will receive 3 nights of auto-CPAP in order to identify those with OSA using flow resistance detected by the device. After 3 nights, those without apparent OSA or with central apnea, and those who simply do not tolerate CPAP will be excluded from the study. An intensive CPAP adherence protocol (iCAP) will be initiated, including collaborative care with rehabilitation nurses, the study's sleep technologist and overnight respiratory therapists. After the run-in period, the sleep technologist will meet at least twice weekly with CPAP-tolerant participants during their rehabilitation stay for further OSA education and encouragement with a target adherence of 4 hours per night. Participants diagnosed with OSA by the device and tolerant will continue CPAP therapy during rehabilitation and at home for a treatment period of 3 months. Adherence will be downloaded remotely from participant's machines to encourage adherence to treatment and troubleshoot any problems with the device.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>Over the 3-night run-in period with CPAP, 28 of the 90 patients enrolled (31%) were excluded: 14 with CPAP use &lt;3 hours, 5 with no evidence of OSA, and 9 with evidence of central or complex sleep apnea. A total of 62 eligible patients (69%) completed the run-in with evidence of OSA and chose to continue CPAP.</pre_assignment_details>

        <population>Among the 62 of the enrolled 90 patients (69%) with evidence of OSA, 52 (84%) patients chose to continue CPAP on inpatient rehabilitation discharge. Three-month CPAP adherence was evaluated in these 52 participants.</population>

            <description>The intensive CPAP adherence protocol (iCAP) initiated during the run-in will be continued during inpatient rehabilitation, including collaborative care with rehabilitation nurses, the study's sleep technologist and overnight respiratory therapists. After the run-in period, the sleep technologist will meet at least twice weekly with CPAP-tolerant participants during their inpatient rehabilitation (IPR) stay for further OSA education and encouragement with a target adherence of 4 hours per night. Participants will be encouraged at the time of IPR discharge to continue CPAP therapy at home for a treatment period of 3 months from CPAP initiation. Adherence will be downloaded remotely from participant's machines to encourage adherence to treatment and troubleshoot any problems with the device.</description>

        <title>Change in the Cognitive Functional Independence Measure (FIM) Subscore</title>
        <description>Change in the cognitive subscale of the Functional Independence Measure (FIM) over 3 months. The FIM, a disability scale measuring the burden of care associated with aspects of motor and cognitive function, includes a motor and cognitive component. The cognitive subscale includes 5 cognitive items: comprehension, expression, social interaction, problem solving and memory. Each of the 5 cognitive items are scored from 1 (complete dependence) to 7 (complete independence). The total scores from these 5 items for the cognitive subscale range from 5 to 35 with lower scores indicating greater functional disability. The 5 items from the cognitive subscale are combined with 13 items from the motor subscale yielding the 18 items of the total FIM with a minimum score of 18 and a maximum score of 126 with lower scores indicating greater functional disability.</description>
