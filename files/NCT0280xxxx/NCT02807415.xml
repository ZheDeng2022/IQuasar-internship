    <textblock>
      Study design. This academic investigator - initiated trial will resolve the key issue&#xD;
      whether, and if yes, to what extent and variability, the treatment with lumacaftor in&#xD;
      combination with ivacaftor (Orkambi®) will reverse the p.Phe508del CFTR - mediated basic&#xD;
      defect in p.Phe508del homozygous subjects with cystic fibrosis (CF) under real life&#xD;
      conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each p.Phe508del homozygous subject will function as his own control. Baseline measurements&#xD;
      will be performed within a 4-week interval prior to the start of oral treatment with&#xD;
      lumacaftor + ivacaftor. According to the phase 3 study results by week 4 the gain of FEV1&#xD;
      levels off, drug levels are in steady state and all reversible initial reductions of lung&#xD;
      function are resolved. Thus the second assessment will be performed during the initial steady&#xD;
      state at a day 10 - 14 weeks after the initiation of oral treatment with lumacaftor +&#xD;
      ivacaftor. At both days of investigations the basic defect will be assessed by Gibson-Cooke&#xD;
      pilocarpine iontophoresis sweat test, nasal transepithelial potential difference measurement&#xD;
      (NPD) and intestinal current measurement (ICM). Moreover lung function will be measured by&#xD;
      spirometry. The plasma concentrations of lumacaftor, ivacaftor, and their metabolites will be&#xD;
      determined and the safety of the oral treatment with Orkambi will be assessed according to&#xD;
      the prescribing information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be requested to record the administration of Orkambi® by date and&#xD;
      time for 7 days before the scheduled visit to perform functional CFTR assays. Orkambi® should&#xD;
      be administered within 30 minutes of consuming fat-containing food according to the&#xD;
      FDA-approved patient labeling and the prescribing information. Subjects will be given a diary&#xD;
      to record the time and doses of administration of Orkambi® for seven days before the&#xD;
      scheduled visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures against recruitment bias. The local patient databases at the three sites will be&#xD;
      searched for all subjects who fulfil the inclusion criteria. After all subjects have been&#xD;
      removed from the list who fulfill one or more exclusion criteria, the eligible subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to rank numbers. Subjects will then be contacted in the sequence as they&#xD;
      appear in the rank number list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis. The sample size estimate is based on the absolute change from baseline&#xD;
      of the cumulative chloride secretory ion current response to forskolin/Isobutyl methyl&#xD;
      xanthine (IBMX) and carbachol in ICM as outcome measure of CFTR function. Assuming a nominal&#xD;
      type I error of 0.05 and a power of 0.8, 125 or 33 subjects are needed to demonstrate a&#xD;
      treatment effect of 5% or 10%, respectively. Thus even modest changes in the basis defect can&#xD;
      be demonstrated in a recruited cohort of 125 subjects and incomplete data sets in up to half&#xD;
      of all subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate changes in lung function and CFTR biomarkers prior and during treatment with&#xD;
      Orkambi® , Student's t test, paired Student's t test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test will be&#xD;
      performed as appropriate. Relationships between CFTR biomarkers will be first assessed by the&#xD;
      Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient and in case that the whole data set will be&#xD;
      explored by canonical correlation analysis. Furthermore the sensitivity and specificity of&#xD;
      the CFTR biomarkers in detecting treatment effects will be determined. The biostatistician&#xD;
      from the Koordinierungszentrum für Klinische Studien (KKS) Heidelberg will assist in the&#xD;
      statistical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical considerations. Orkambi® has been approved for treatment of subjects with cystic&#xD;
      fibrosis, homozygous for the p.Phe508del mutation. Drug handling and safety controls will be&#xD;
      executed according to the Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte&#xD;
      (BfArM)-approved patient labeling and full prescribing information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol and informed consent forms were approved by the ethics committees. Prior to&#xD;
      any investigation patients and their parental guides (if applicable) will be informed about&#xD;
      the background, objectives, schedule and assessments of the study. Each adult aged 18 years&#xD;
      or older must sign and date the study-specific informed-consent form before any&#xD;
      study-specific procedures can be performed. Subjects aged 12 - 17 years must assent to&#xD;
      participate in the study and the subject's parent or legal guardian must sign and date the&#xD;
      study-specific informed-consent form before any study-specific procedures can be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sweat test and NPD are safe procedures. Burns during iontophoresis, injuries by placement of&#xD;
      the subcutaneous electrode for NPD or diuresis induced by swallowing of amiloride in younger&#xD;
      subjects during nasal superfusion have not been observed at the three sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collection of rectal biopsies is principally a safe and painless procedure. ICM has been&#xD;
      performed at Hannover Medical School. since 1995. During these 20 years bleedings have been&#xD;
      observed in five subjects one of whom required hospitalization. Haemorrhoids and abnormal&#xD;
      bleeding times are contraindications for ICM and are exclusion criteria to participate in the&#xD;
      study. Hence, with the exception of the low bleeding risk associated with the collection of&#xD;
      rectal biopsies study participants are not put at risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no direct benefit for study participants, however, the decision whether or not&#xD;
      Orkambi® should be prescribed can be based on solid data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality assurance. Sweat test, NPD, ICM and sampling (blood, serum, plasma) will be performed&#xD;
      according to harmonized Standard Operating Procedures based on protocols of the Clinical&#xD;
      Trials Network of the European Cystic Fibrosis Society and/or the Therapeutics Development&#xD;
      Network Coordinating Center of the US Cystic Fibrosis Foundation and/or the Hannover Unified&#xD;
      Biobank. Pre-study hands-on meetings have been organized to compare on-site the execution of&#xD;
      the protocols including sweat test, NPD, ICM, lung function testing and sampling, processing,&#xD;
      storage of serum and plasma specimens. Sweat testing is subject to domestic quality control&#xD;
      trials. Local and central reading will be performed for all NPD and ICM tracings. The sites&#xD;
      have long-standing expertise in CFTR biomarkers and have trained numerous domestic and&#xD;
      European sites in NPD and ICM. - Subjects will be educated in drug dosing. A diary with drug&#xD;
      dosing (date and time) will be filled out during the 7 days prior to the day of assessment.&#xD;
