  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a Phase 1/2 open-label involving 2 groups of patients newly diagnosed with&#xD;
      either unfavorable intermediate risk or high risk prostate adenocarcinoma. One group will&#xD;
      receive only EBRT and the other group will receive a Brachytherapy boost and EBRT. Both&#xD;
      groups will receive treatment with androgen deprivation. There will be 2 consecutive steps, a&#xD;
      dose escalation and a subsequent dose expansion part.&#xD;

      This is a Phase 1/2 prospective, open-label, two cohorts, non-randomized trial consisting of&#xD;
      two consecutive steps, a dose escalation and a subsequent dose expansion part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1 DOSE ESCALATION: subjects with newly diagnosed Unfavorable Intermediate&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk (UIR) or High Risk (HR) prostate adenocarcinoma, will participate in a dose escalation&#xD;
      of NBTXR3 activated by two different radiation schedules. NBTXR3 will be administered by&#xD;
      intra-prostate injection and then activated 10 days later either by:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  EBRT delivered as 45 Gy in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy each; to the prostate and seminal&#xD;
           vesicles, followed by 34.2 Gy in 19 fractions to the prostate and proximal seminal&#xD;
           vesicles, over 9-10 weeks, utilizing intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with daily&#xD;
           image guidance aligned to implanted fiducial markers (COHORT A) or,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brachytherapy Boost and EBRT delivered as a single fraction of 15 Gy in one day to the&#xD;
           prostate by High Dose Rate Brachytherapy followed by EBRT (initiated within 2-4 weeks&#xD;
           after completion of Brachytherapy), delivered as 45 Gy in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy to the&#xD;
           prostate and seminal vesicles utilizing intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with&#xD;
           daily image guidance aligned to implanted fiducial markers (COHORT B)&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2 DOSE EXPANSION: Two parallel cohorts of subjects, A and B, 20 subjects per cohort,&#xD;
      will be treated at either the RD1 (Recommended Dose of NBTXR3 given as intraprostate&#xD;
      injection and activated by EBRT) or RD2 (Recommended Dose of NBTXR3 given as intra-prostate&#xD;
      injection and activated by Brachytherapy Boost and EBRT), as determined in the Phase I dose&#xD;
      escalation of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) LHRH / GnRH agonist beginning 8&#xD;
      weeks before the NBTXR3 administration and for 24 months in subjects with (HR) prostate&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. The duration of ADT in subjects with (UIR) disease will be of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will receive a single intra-prostate injection of NBTXR3 which will be delivered to&#xD;
      the prostate via transperineal injection under TRUS guidance injection. NBTXR3 injection will&#xD;
      be performed on Day 1 and will be assessed for safety, intra-prostate availability and&#xD;
      presence of NBTXR3 in the peripheral circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COHORT A: External beam radiation therapy will be delivered to the prostate starting within 9&#xD;
      days after the NBTXR3 injection (Day 10). Total dose of 79.2 Gy, delivered as 25 fractions of&#xD;
      1.8 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles (45 Gy), followed by 34.2 Gy in 19 fractions to&#xD;
      the prostate and proximal seminal vesicles, delivered over 9-10 weeks, utilizing intensity&#xD;
      modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with daily image guidance aligned to implanted fiducial markers&#xD;
      COHORT B: HDR Brachytherapy implantation will be performed within 9 days after NBTXR3&#xD;
      injection (Day 10). Brachytherapy Boost delivered as a single fraction of 15 Gy in one day to&#xD;
      the prostate by High Dose Rate Brachytherapy followed by EBRT (initiated within 2-4 weeks&#xD;
      after completion of Brachytherapy) delivered as 45 Gy in 25 fractions of 1.8 Gy to the&#xD;
      prostate and seminal vesicles utilizing intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) with daily&#xD;
      image guidance aligned to implanted fiducial markers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be followed for safety assessment until the end of the study. Before the onset&#xD;
      of study treatment, subjects must have a histologic diagnosis of either Unfavorable&#xD;
      Intermediate Risk (UIR) or High Risk (HR) prostate adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
