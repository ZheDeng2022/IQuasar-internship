  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      About 15% of couples consult for difficulties achieving pregnancy. In about two-thirds of&#xD;
      cases, a male component is identified, but is not always sufficient to explain infertility.&#xD;
      In the majority of cases, the cause cannot be clearly identified and multiple abnormalities&#xD;
      may be detected in both partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many factors concerning lifestyle and environment (medications, alcohol, smoking, pollution,&#xD;
      exposure to heat, toxins, xenobiotic oestrogens, etc.) may impact on fertility. These factors&#xD;
      may also impact on the fertility of the children conceived, which is described as an&#xD;
      intergenerational effect (alteration of the fertility of boys exposed to smoking in utero).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few scientific studies with a high level of proof have been published on the impact of&#xD;
      smoking on the couple's fertility. Gonadal functioning and the quality of gametes can be&#xD;
      altered by these environmental factors, which may trigger a process of apoptosis or&#xD;
      alteration of the DNA of gametes (sperm DNA fragmentation). Other modifications include DNA&#xD;
      methylation and histone acetylation, which control gene expression and are grouped under the&#xD;
      term epigenetic modifications. More recently, oestrogens has been shown to be involved in&#xD;
      male reproductive function by acting on spermatogenesis, spermiogenesis and epididymal&#xD;
      maturation. Demonstration of an active aromatase (Arom) (mRNA, protein and activity) in&#xD;
      ejaculated human spermatozoa suggests the synthesis of small quantities of oestrogens in&#xD;
      spermatozoa. The study of transcript profiles could provide information about the quality of&#xD;
      spermatogenesis and/or spermiogenesis and during the first steps of embryonic development.&#xD;
      Confocal microscopy has colocalized the aromatase on the head, midpiece and tail and can be&#xD;
      used to assess the quality of the acrosome with anti-CD-46 monoclonal antibody. Even low&#xD;
      concentrations of xenobiotic oestrogens can exert biological effects on certain functions of&#xD;
      murine or human spermatozoa, accelerating capacitation and the acrosome reaction. These&#xD;
      factors are all the more effective when they act in combination, as human gametes appear to&#xD;
      be more sensitive to their action than murine gametes All studies conducted to date have&#xD;
      investigated the impact of toxins either on one of the partners or in the children born to&#xD;
      the couple. No detailed and high-level scientific study has studied both partners and the&#xD;
      quality of their embryos.&#xD;

      The Amiens University Hospital Cytogenetic, CECOS Reproduction Biology, and the assisted&#xD;
      reproductive technology departments in collaboration with Caen University Hospital (members&#xD;
      of G4) want to conduct this type of routine clinical practice follow-up study in the context&#xD;
      of an inter-regional research grant (PHRC). These 2 University Hospitals are situated in&#xD;
      agricultural regions with potential polluting industries. The recruitment of these centres&#xD;
      comprises younger couples presenting with infertility for which a cause cannot always be&#xD;
      demonstrated and in which the percentage of ART by ICSI is higher than the national average&#xD;
      (close to 75% vs 60%). This population also presents a higher cancer risk than in other&#xD;
      regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research project concerns evaluation of the impact of male smoking on the couple's&#xD;
      fertility and will consist of a two-centre case-control study.&#xD;
