  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For the past 130 years, appendectomy has been the standard treatment for appendicitis. Recent&#xD;
      studies from Europe have challenged the notion that surgery is the best option, showing that&#xD;
      antibiotics alone can treat appendicitis without a need for appendectomy in as many as 3 out&#xD;
      of 4 patients and without safety issues for up to one year of follow up. Despite these&#xD;
      results, it remains to be determined if the antibiotic strategy is as good as an appendectomy&#xD;
      for the outcomes that most patients care about. The Patient-Centered Outcomes Research&#xD;
      Institute (PCORI)-funded Comparison of Outcomes of Drugs and Appendectomy (CODA) trial will&#xD;
      be the first American, and largest-ever randomized trial of the issue and its results should&#xD;
      help surgeons and patients make more informed healthcare decisions.&#xD;

      The Comparison of Outcomes of Antibiotic Drugs and Appendectomy (CODA) trial aims to test, if&#xD;
      from a patient's perspective, the antibiotics strategy is &quot;just as good as&quot; surgery. The&#xD;
      investigators believe that patients, clinicians, and the people who pay for healthcare (both&#xD;
      patients and insurers) will find the antibiotics approach acceptable if 1) it results in high&#xD;
      rates of treatment success, 2) does not increase complications, and 3) provides an equivalent&#xD;
      or better patient experience. A large-scale non-inferiority trial is expected to result in a&#xD;
      change in the management of one of the most common human illnesses. If non-inferiority is&#xD;
      demonstrated (or superiority of the antibiotics approach identified), that finding will&#xD;
      improve patient choice and should support a shift to the less invasive approach. If&#xD;
      non-inferiority is not established, results may help to delineate the trade-offs between the&#xD;
      two treatment approaches and inform decision-making.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The observation that patients with acute uncomplicated appendicitis (AUA) can be cured with&#xD;
      antibiotics-alone has a scientific rationale. Traditionally, appendicitis was thought to&#xD;
      result from a blockage of the appendix and that, if left untreated, inevitably led to a&#xD;
      perforation. Contrary to this physiologic model, Carr demonstrated that obstruction of the&#xD;
      appendix is an unlikely primary cause in the majority of patients and that most are caused by&#xD;
      an enteric infection. A recent randomized trial found an increased rate of appendectomy with&#xD;
      early use of computed tomography (CT) imaging and diagnostic laparoscopy, but case reports of&#xD;
      appendicitis remission documented by serial CT all suggest that leaving the appendix in place&#xD;
      does not inexorably lead to clinical compromise. A common concern of clinicians when&#xD;
      considering treating AUA with antibiotics is that not removing the appendix may lead to&#xD;
      perforation and complications from complicated appendicitis. Evidence suggests, however, that&#xD;
      perforated appendicitis is a pre-hospital event and that non-perforated appendicitis is a&#xD;
      &quot;different&quot; disease. This theory is supported by a general lack of relation between a delay&#xD;
      in surgery of up to 24-36 hours and perforation rates. Most recently, Fusobacterium sp., a&#xD;
      genus of enteric Gram-negative anaerobic bacteria, rather than an obstructive stone, was&#xD;
      found to be correlated with the presence of appendicitis and the degree of inflammation. What&#xD;
      remains to be determined is whether certain bacterial colonies or features of individual&#xD;
      immune response are most associated with progression of appendicitis without appendectomy and&#xD;
      whether successful outcomes for people undergoing antibiotics can be predicted based on the&#xD;
      patient's characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional rationale for this study is to address limitations of prior trials. To avoid&#xD;
      misclassification problems of other trials, all patients will undergo standard radiographic&#xD;
      imaging including CT, ultrasound (US), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Patients with an&#xD;
      appendicolith will be included in the trial but considered a unique subgroup and will be&#xD;
      evaluated as part of a pre-specified analysis (potentially excluding them from future&#xD;
      recruitment if an early analysis demonstrates futility related to the primary antibiotic&#xD;
      approach not being successful). To reflect usual and emerging techniques in treatment, the&#xD;
      study includes both types of appendectomy (open and laparoscopic) and a broad range of&#xD;
      antibiotic strategies including the option for an &quot;all outpatient&quot; treatment schedule with&#xD;
      once daily dosing of longer-acting agents. Patients in the antibiotics arm will be given a&#xD;
      minimum of 24 hours of intravenous (IV) antibiotics (using any appropriate dosing schedule&#xD;
      and based on the patient's ability to tolerate oral medication), followed by oral antibiotics&#xD;
      for a total of 10 days of antibiotic treatment). Discharge from the hospital or emergency&#xD;
      department (ED) or a change in treatment arms will be guided by clinical targets and reasons&#xD;
      for change in treatment arms will be assessed. Patients will be followed for up to two years&#xD;
      to assess for longer-term complications, eventual appendectomy (performed anywhere), quality&#xD;
      of life (QoL), gastrointestinal symptoms, and decisional regret. To quantify selection bias&#xD;
      and to promote generalizability, all patients approached for the study and those who refuse&#xD;
      randomization will be characterized at baseline. A parallel cohort of patients who refuse&#xD;
      randomization (250 who initiate the antibiotics strategy and 250 who select the appendectomy&#xD;
      strategy) will be surveyed for two years.&#xD;
