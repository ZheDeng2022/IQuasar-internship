  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics following single dose of 10 milligrams (mg) to 180 mg of GSK2330672 in&#xD;
      Japanese healthy subjects. This is a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      dose-escalating and incomplete block crossover study to be conducted in 16 Japanese healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Study will be conducted in four periods; subjects will receive either placebo or&#xD;
      GSK2330672 (10 mg, 30 mg, 90 mg or 180 mg based on randomization) in each treatment period.&#xD;
      Each period will be separated by washout period (at least 6 days from dosing). Total duration&#xD;
      of study for each subject will be approximately 5 weeks from the first dosing to follow up&#xD;
      visit.&#xD;
