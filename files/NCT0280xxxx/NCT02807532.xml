      To investigate whether apelin can be used as an indicator to predict postoperative atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation in patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, and to provide an&#xD;
      objective basis for the clinical selection of a preventive intervention program for atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Atherosclerosis is a systematic and progressive pathological process, which commonly occurs&#xD;
      in the intima of large and medium-sized arteries. The disease can lead to degenerative,&#xD;
      proliferative, non-inflammatory lesions; thickening, hardening, and loss of elasticity of the&#xD;
      vascular wall, and vascular stenosis; and reduced arterial blood flow. Eventually, organ&#xD;
      damage occurs. Coronary atherosclerotic heart disease is the most common chronic degenerative&#xD;
      disease caused by atherosclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) can effectively increase myocardial blood supply,&#xD;
      prevent myocardial infarction, and improve quality of life, and is associated with low rates&#xD;
      of surgical complications and mortality. However, new-onset atrial fibrillation is a common&#xD;
      complication after coronary artery bypass grafting, with an incidence rate of 30%. It induces&#xD;
      hemodynamic instability, is often accompanied by left-ventricular systolic dysfunction and&#xD;
      congestive heart failure, and increases the risk of stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that the initiation and maintenance of atrial fibrillation is&#xD;
      strongly associated with inflammation, which affects the electrical and structural remodeling&#xD;
      of the heart. The role of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, has been widely&#xD;
      investigated. C-reactive protein is a non-specific acute-phase protein, and is elevated in&#xD;
      many cardiovascular diseases, including coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, heart failure&#xD;
      and hypertension. Elevated C-reactive protein levels are not only associated with simple and&#xD;
      post-surgical atrial fibrillation, but also with cardioversion and recurrence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation after ablation. However, there is no elevation of C-reactive protein levels in&#xD;
      lone atrial fibrillation, indicating that inflammation is associated with cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, but not with atrial fibrillation per se. One of the aims of the present study is to&#xD;
      determine how C-reactive protein levels in patients with new-onset atrial fibrillation change&#xD;
      after coronary artery bypass grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apelin has anti-inflammatory effects in different tissues. Ellinor et al. showed that levels&#xD;
      of apelin-12 were remarkably low in patients with atrial fibrillation. Recurrence of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation is high in patients with persistent atrial fibrillation and low apelin-12 levels&#xD;
      after electrical cardioversion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apelin is an endogenous ligand of the G-protein coupled receptor APJ, and exhibits homology&#xD;
      to angiotensin II. The signaling system stimulated by apelin regulates many physiological&#xD;
      functions and pathological processes. The main target of apelin is the cardiovascular system;&#xD;
      it dilates blood vessels, and has antifibrotic and positive inotropic effects. Falcone et al.&#xD;
      showed that the risk of recurrence of atrial fibrillation was 3.1 times greater in patients&#xD;
      with low apelin levels than those with high apelin levels. Furthermore, Yang et al. concluded&#xD;
      that apelin levels were lower in patients with different types of atrial fibrillation than in&#xD;
      controls, indicating that apelin might contribute to the initiation and maintenance of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators carried out a literature search on the Web of Science and&#xD;
      ClinicalTrials.gov, using the search terms &quot;apelin&quot;, &quot;coronary artery bypass&quot;, and &quot;atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation&quot;. The investigators also searched the Wanfang Database and China National&#xD;
      Knowledge Infrastructure, using the terms &quot;apelin&quot;, &quot;coronary atherosclerotic heart disease&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;surgery&quot;, and &quot;atrial fibrillation&quot;; or &quot;apelin&quot;, &quot;coronary atherosclerotic heart disease&quot;,&#xD;
      &quot;coronary artery bypass grafting&quot;, and &quot;atrial fibrillation&quot;. However, the investigators&#xD;
      found no clinical studies of the relationship between apelin and atrial fibrillation after&#xD;
      coronary artery bypass grafting. The investigators therefore designed the present study to&#xD;
      investigate this relationship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cohort study, patients with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease scheduled to&#xD;
      undergo coronary artery bypass grafting will be assigned to high and low apelin groups,&#xD;
      according to preoperative apelin levels. The incidence of atrial fibrillation will be&#xD;
      compared between the two groups 7 days postoperatively. In addition, a case-control trial in&#xD;
      the same patients will compare plasma apelin levels and inflammatory response between those&#xD;
      patients with and without atrial fibrillation 7 days postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events Adverse events after coronary artery bypass grafting will be recorded. These&#xD;
      might include myocardial infarction, myocardial ischemia, bradycardia, hypotension, and stent&#xD;
      thrombosis. The investigators will provide a detailed record of date of onset,&#xD;
      treatment-related processing method, and possible relationship with treatment. All adverse&#xD;
      reactions should be reported to the researcher in charge and clinical Institutional Review&#xD;
      Board within 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection, management, analysis and open access Data collection: A table will be&#xD;
      formulated for data collection according to the trial design. Data will be added to an&#xD;
      electronic database using a double data entry strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data management: Accuracy of information will be checked when all recruited patients are&#xD;
      followed up. The database will be locked by the researcher in charge and will not be altered.&#xD;
      All information relating to this trial will be preserved by The General Hospital of Shenyang&#xD;
      Military Region, China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: The electronic database will be fully disclosed to a statistician for&#xD;
      statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open access: Published data will be available at www.figshare.com.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Statistical analysis will be performed by a statistician blinded to&#xD;
      group assignment, using SPSS 19.0 software. If measurement data are normally distributed,&#xD;
      data will be expressed as mean Â± SD, and count data will be expressed as percentages. P &lt;&#xD;
      0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the cohort study, the chi-square test will be used to compare the incidence rate of&#xD;
      new-onset atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting in patients with high and&#xD;
      low apelin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case-control study, paired t-tests will be used to compare plasma apelin, brain&#xD;
      natriuretic peptide, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein levels in patients with and&#xD;
      without atrial fibrillation. Multivariate logistic regression analysis will be applied to&#xD;
      determine the relationship between plasma apelin levels, cardiac fibrosis and inflammatory&#xD;
      response with atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency and measures for monitoring trial implementation Trial progression will be reported&#xD;
      to the Ethics Committee of the General Hospital of Shenyang Military Region every month and&#xD;
      the trial's status will be updated in the registration database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Confidentiality Test data, including medical records, will be saved electronically and in&#xD;
      hard copy. The electronic data will be preserved in a dedicated password-protected computer&#xD;
      and managed by a data manager. The paper data will be preserved in a secure, locked place by&#xD;
      the data manager and researcher in charge for future viewing.&#xD;
