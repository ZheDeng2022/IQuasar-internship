      Summary of the proposed research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intravenous application of prostacyclin (PGE1) or its stable analogue, iloprost, has been&#xD;
      used to cause a decrease not only of the pulmonary but also of the systemic vascular tone.&#xD;
      Aerosolized prostacyclin, on the other hand, can result in a selective pulmonary&#xD;
      vasodilatation without affecting the systemic blood pressure as shown in preliminary&#xD;
      studies/case reports. No large trials exist for this type of use of the drug so far.&#xD;
      Furthermore, aerosolized PGI2 can improve gas exchange and pulmonary shunt in clinical&#xD;
      settings of impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio as it occurs in adult respiratory distress&#xD;
      syndrome (ARDS) due to the redistribution of pulmonary blood flow from non-ventilated to&#xD;
      ventilated, aerosol accessible lung regions. Therefore, the investigators propose to carry&#xD;
      out a prospective, double blinded, randomized trial to show that the nebulized iloprost&#xD;
      decreases pulmonary hypertension selectively and improves oxygenation in ARDS.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary hypertension, defined as mean PA (pulmonary arterial) pressure of &gt; 25 mm Hg, is an&#xD;
      end point of a variety of conditions. These include primary pulmonary hypertension,&#xD;
      post-operative pulmonary hypertension and as a result of increased pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      resistance that occurs in ARDS. This is an entity distinguished by hypoxemia, non-cardiogenic&#xD;
      pulmonary edema and bilateral infiltrates on chest X-ray. Prostacyclin (PGE1), an arachidonic&#xD;
      acid metabolite, or its stable analogue, iloprost, has been evaluated for its efficacy in the&#xD;
      treatment of pulmonary hypertension and for its use in reducing intra-pulmonary shunting in&#xD;
      ARDS. While the intravenous application of iloprost can cause a decrease not only of the&#xD;
      pulmonary but also of the systemic vascular tone, the aerosolized prostacyclin can result in&#xD;
      a selective pulmonary vasodilatation without affecting the systemic blood pressure as&#xD;
      demonstrated in preliminary studies/reports. Furthermore, aerosolized iloprost can improve&#xD;
      gas exchange and pulmonary shunt in clinical settings of impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio&#xD;
      as it occurs in ARDS, due to the redistribution of pulmonary blood flow from non-ventilated&#xD;
      to ventilated, aerosol accessible lung regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous case reports and non-randomized studies have indicated that inhalation of&#xD;
      aerosolized iloprost may offer a new life saving strategy in intractable pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and ARDS. Further, advantages of inhaled iloprost include the lack of adverse&#xD;
      reactions and toxic side effects as well as convenient and more cost-effective&#xD;
      administration. Other available therapies like nitric oxide inhalation costs more, around Rs&#xD;
      350/liter and a total of 34-45 liters per patient is required. It is also associated with&#xD;
      additional side effects, such as thrombocytopenia. Due to the irreversible nature of ARDS&#xD;
      associated with high rate of mortality also affecting resource allocation in critically ill&#xD;
      patients, we suggest carrying out this study in our intensive care unit (ICU), where the&#xD;
      incidence is &gt; 10% resulting in almost 90% mortality (ICU Quality Indicators Jan-Apr 20048).&#xD;
      Iloprost is completely metabolized and excretion of metabolites is primarily via the kidneys;&#xD;
      the elimination half-life is 30 minutes. Inhalation therapy reduces systemic absorption and&#xD;
      hence elimination half-life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, aerosolized iloprost was found effective in improving the functional&#xD;
      class of the patient, exercise capacity and improved shunting. However, large randomized&#xD;
      trials are needed to prove the efficacy of this cost effective therapy in patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension and ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To carry out a prospective, double blinded, randomized trial to show that the nebulized PGE1,&#xD;
      a stable prostacyclin derivative, decreases pulmonary hypertension selectively and improves&#xD;
      oxygenation in ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      *ALPROSTADIL (20 mcg ampule) manufactured by Schering, Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of work:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prostacyclin (PGE1), an arachidonic acid metabolite, has been evaluated for its efficacy in&#xD;
      the treatment of pulmonary hypertension and for its use in reducing intra-pulmonary shunting&#xD;
      in ARDS. While the intravenous application PGE1, or alprostadil, can cause a decrease not&#xD;
      only of the pulmonary but also of the systemic vascular tone, the aerosolized PGE1 results in&#xD;
      a selective pulmonary vasodilation without affecting the systemic blood pressure.&#xD;
      Furthermore, aerosolized PGE1 can improve gas exchange and pulmonary shunt in clinical&#xD;
      settings of impaired ventilation/perfusion ratio as it occurs in ARDS, due to the&#xD;
      redistribution of pulmonary blood flow from non-ventilated to ventilated, aerosol accessible&#xD;
      lung regions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical review of relevant literature on the subject:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous case reports and non randomized studies have indicated that inhalation of&#xD;
      aerosolized alprostadil may offer a new life saving strategy in intractable pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and ARDS. Further, advantages of inhaled iloprost include the lack of adverse&#xD;
      reactions and toxic side effects as well as convenient and more cost-effective&#xD;
      administration. Due to the irreversible nature of ARDS associated with high rate of mortality&#xD;
      also affecting resource allocation in critically ill patients, we suggest carrying out this&#xD;
      study in our intensive care unit (ICU), where the incidence is &gt; 10% resulting in almost 90%&#xD;
      mortality (ICU Quality Indicators Jan-Apr 20048).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous study, aerosolized alprostadil was effective in improving the functional class&#xD;
      of the patient, exercise capacity and improved shunting. Large randomized trials are needed&#xD;
      to prove the efficacy of this cost effective therapy in patients with pulmonary hypertension&#xD;
      and ARDS. Other available therapies like nitric oxide inhalation costs higher around Rs&#xD;
      350/liter and a total of 34-45 liters per patient is required. It is also associated with&#xD;
      additional side effects, such as thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resume of any related work carried out by the principal investigator or co-Investigator in&#xD;
      this area:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal investigator and co-investigator have the relevant qualification, experience&#xD;
      and expertise to conduct this study, as is obvious from the list of recent selected&#xD;
      publications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls:&#xD;
&#xD;
      From selected patients included in the study in a random, blinded manner. Patients will be&#xD;
      given a drug or placebo to be determined by pharmacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Work Up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After enrolling, the following tests will be carried out to determine inclusion/ exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Transthoracic echo - to rule out ejection fraction &lt; 30%&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary embolus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pulmonary hypertension (TR jet) to be determined by echo&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arterial blood gas&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CXR reviewed to determine ARDS criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug (alprostadil/placebo - normal saline) to be nebulized; 5 micrograms via standard&#xD;
      nebulizer within 4 hours, once.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardization of Critical Care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardization of treatment modalities have been incorporated in the methodology with regard&#xD;
      to ventilatory support, inotropic support and fluid management; however, as the intensive&#xD;
      care unit at the AKUH is an 'open unit' where patients are primarily taken care of by the&#xD;
      primary teams and a critical care consultant (of which the PI is one), strict guidelines&#xD;
      cannot be enforced. However we have given a general range of parameters, keeping in mind the&#xD;
      recommendations of the Society of Critical Care medicine and the Acute Respiratory Distress&#xD;
      Syndrome Network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, the patients will be managed by the ICU consultant and the primary physician&#xD;
      (may not always include PI). The following broad criteria will be followed in order to treat&#xD;
      the patient:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Ventilatory support in ARDS/Pulmonary hypertension:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any ventilatory mode can be used&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Peak airway pressures (Pa) will be maintained under 35 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Peep range to be between 8-14 mm Hg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Tidal volumes of 6 cc/kg&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Inotropic Support:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Dopamine (5-20 mics/kg/min) as a positive inotrope (dopaminergic, alpha and beta agonist&#xD;
           activity) and norepinephrine (0.1-0.5 mics/kg/min) as a vasopressor (alpha agonist) are&#xD;
           used for increasing blood pressure. The goal will be to maintain a mean arterial&#xD;
           pressure (DBP plus 1/3 rd of pulse pressure) of &gt; 60 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fluid management:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Keeping a wedge pressure &lt; 20 mm Hg will be the goal of fluid management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assuming total Karachi population of over 150,000 (1998 Demographic Survey of Pakistan) of&#xD;
      all age groups, and taking incidence of 20% (+/- 105 bound of error) of pulmonary&#xD;
      hypertension and ARDS at 95% confidence interval, we extricated a sample size to be 91 cases&#xD;
      (with 91 controls). Epi-info version 1.1 was used to calculate sample size. Actual sample&#xD;
      size 182.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If met, trial will be terminated early in favor of using the drug. Positive result will&#xD;
           be taken as PA pressures - mean PA pressure decreases by 10 in 4 hours and PaO2/FiO2&#xD;
           ratio - increases by 50 (or PaO2 increases by 10) in 4 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results will be recorded in a Data Sheet - (see Appendix I).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests done: Arterial blood gases. Transthoracic echo before and after drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics: Written approval of Aga Khan University Ethics Review Committee (ERC) has been&#xD;
      obtained prior to commencement of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Each patient after enrollment will be assigned a serial number consecutively after&#xD;
      meeting inclusion criteria reviewed by the principal investigator and research assistant.&#xD;
      After the necessary workup and consent, drug shall be obtained from the AKUH pharmacy. The&#xD;
      pharmacy will carry out randomization and deliver either alprostadil or normal saline&#xD;
      (placebo) in an unmarked vial. Delivery dose and frequency will be carried out similarly for&#xD;
      all patients. Data will be collected by the research assistant and nurse. At the end of the&#xD;
      trial (after all cases and controls have been enrolled) the serial numbers of the patients&#xD;
      will be matched to the delivery chart of the pharmacy to see whether they received the drug&#xD;
      or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Year wise plan of work to be used during period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion exclusion (Pulm. HTN, ARDS) (not intubated, no swan)&#xD;
&#xD;
      echo LVF, RVF, pulmonary embolus&#xD;
&#xD;
      Swan ganz catheter (wedge &lt; 20)&#xD;
&#xD;
      consent (serial # and inform pharmacy)&#xD;
