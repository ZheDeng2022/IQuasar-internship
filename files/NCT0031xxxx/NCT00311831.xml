    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the caregivers of children presenting to&#xD;
      the emergency department (ED) with acute gastroenteritis who receive extensive&#xD;
      gastroenteritis education (standard education plus home nursing visit) will improve their&#xD;
      gastroenteritis knowledge more than those who receive standard education (an information&#xD;
      sheet) in the emergency department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, diarrhea remains a leading cause of childhood morbidity and mortality, with 2.5&#xD;
      million deaths estimated to occur annually among children &lt; 5 years of age. In the United&#xD;
      States, acute gastroenteritis accounts for &gt; 1.5 million outpatient visits, 200,000&#xD;
      hospitalizations and approximately 300 deaths/year. The incidence of diarrhea varies between&#xD;
      one and 2.5 episodes per child per year. In Ontario, children account for over 28,000&#xD;
      Emergency Department visits for gastroenteritis annually, and the pediatric admission rate&#xD;
      for gastroenteritis remains greater than 400/100,000. In a Toronto based report from 1978,&#xD;
      viral gastroenteritis was found as the etiologic agent in the deaths of 21 children over a 5&#xD;
      year period. Over 10% of patients seen at The Hospital for Sick Children ED present with&#xD;
      acute gastroenteritis (vomiting, diarrhea or both). Last year over 4500 children with these&#xD;
      complaints were seen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been suggested that education can improve caregiver knowledge, beliefs and practices&#xD;
      related to gastroenteritis. Children of caregivers who are less knowledgeable about diarrhea,&#xD;
      dehydration and oral rehydration have been found to be at increased risk for presenting to a&#xD;
      hospital secondary to dehydration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it has been difficult to determine if this will translate into a reduction in&#xD;
      non-urgent ED use. Very few studies have evaluated education in the ED. When it has been&#xD;
      studied, they have been unsuccessful in altering ED utilization habits. One possible&#xD;
      explanation for the lack of success is that some interventions have attempted to teach the&#xD;
      parents while they were awaiting discharge. At that point in time, the parents are tired,&#xD;
      distracted, and probably anxious to leave, thereby diminishing the effect of the&#xD;
      intervention. Furthermore, providing patients with information handouts is not the optimal&#xD;
      approach to achieve patient/parent education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare two interventions for caregivers of children with gastroenteritis:&#xD;
      extensive gastroenteritis education (standard education plus home nursing visit) and standard&#xD;
      education in the emergency department(an information sheet). By adding on a home health nurse&#xD;
      visit 12 to 36 hours later, we hope to achieve several benefits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increased parental knowledge regarding gastroenteritis. This includes etiology and&#xD;
           prevention, signs and symptoms of dehydration, when to seek care, the appropriate use of&#xD;
           oral rehydration solutions, re-feeding, and the role of medications (or lack thereof).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Increased parental knowledge will hopefully translate into reduced resource use. This&#xD;
           may translate into improved use for other non-acute illnesses such as fever and colds.&#xD;
           Improved resource use may include a reduction in ED visits and potentially even primary&#xD;
           care provider use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. This may also translate into improved patient outcomes by avoiding dehydration,&#xD;
           decreasing transmission and seeking medications for the illness. Fewer ED visits may&#xD;
           additionally translate into fewer investigations and intravenous requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus we will compare improvement in caregiver knowledge of gastroenteritis and dehydration&#xD;
      and number of emergency department visits at one year in the two treatment groups.&#xD;
