      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Evaluate the effect of an exercise therapy program and patient education, versus patient&#xD;
           education only, on hip function among patients with radiologically verified hip OA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify biomechanical differences during gait, one-leg standing , and&#xD;
           two-legged-raise analysis in patients with hip OA following either exercise therapy and&#xD;
           patient education program, or a patient education program only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant improved hip function (WOMAC) will be demonstrated in patients with hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis (OA) (radiographically verified hip OA) following a patient education program&#xD;
      and a 12 week exercise therapy program, compared to those only going through a patient&#xD;
      education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      110 patients with radiographically verified hip OA will be included in the randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial; they will be randomized into:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patient Education, or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient Education in addition to a supervised exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Disease Specific WOMAC-Index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SF-36v2 (quality of life),PASE (activity score), Self-efficacy for pain, muscle strength&#xD;
      tests, gait analysis (biomechanical analysis),6 minutes walking test, Åstrand's bike test,&#xD;
      range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Status:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PhD student is accepted at the University of Oslo,and the study has so far included 17&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
      NAR-Orthopedic Centre, Ullevaal University Hospital in collaboration with Diakonhjemmet&#xD;
      Hospital and University of Delaware.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is included in our research program for active rehabilitation.&#xD;

      Aim 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effect of an exercise therapy program for 12 weeks and a patient education&#xD;
      program compared to a patient education program only on hip function (WOMAC) in patients with&#xD;
      hip osteoarthritis (OA) (radiographically verified hip OA, Harris Hip Score 60-95p, and &gt;3&#xD;
      months of hip pain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To identify biomechanical differences during gait analysis in patients with hip OA following&#xD;
      either exercise therapy and patient education program, or a patient education program only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant improved hip function (WOMAC) will be demonstrated in patients with hip&#xD;
      osteoarthritis following a patients education program with an additionally 12 week exercise&#xD;
      therapy program, compared to those only going through a patient education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIAL AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients between 40 and 80 years old with uni- or bilateral hip disability not eligible for&#xD;
      hip surgery will be recruited from Orthopaedic Centre, Ullevål University Hospital, NIMI, and&#xD;
      Diakonhjemmets Sykehus (Hospital), Oslo. Inclusion criteria for all subjects are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Harris Hip Score (35) between 60 and 95, and hip pain of more than 3 months. Harris Hip&#xD;
           Score (35) of 60 or below are used regularly at our institution as one of the criteria&#xD;
           for hip surgery (arthroplasty), therefore Harris Hip Score between 60 and 95 is used as&#xD;
           inclusion criteria for the present study population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All subjects will have x-ray taken. Those with radiographic verified hip OA will be&#xD;
           classifies by an orthopaedic surgeon (LN) according to Danielsson's criteria for&#xD;
           radiographic hip OA (34).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and ten patients with radiographic verified hip OA will be included in the&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will be excluded if they have a history of resent trauma or functional&#xD;
           impairment to the lower limbs or diseases which might interfere with participation&#xD;
           (rheumatoid arthritis, cancer, osteoporosis, severe back pain, knee OA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with co-morbidities not tolerating physical activities will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions It is not considered ethically or practically feasible to use a control group&#xD;
      receiving no treatment in this study. Hence, both randomized groups will be offered the&#xD;
      patient education intervention, and one of the groups will receive exercise therapy in&#xD;
      addition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Education (KLASSBO M, 2003):&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients with hip disability with or without verified radiographic OA included in the&#xD;
      study will receive two individual and three small-group (6-7 patients) sessions lasting one&#xD;
      hour each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exercise protocol includes exercises from former studies on comparable patient&#xD;
      populations. The intensity of the strength- and flexibility exercises meets the American&#xD;
      College of Sports Medicine's (ACSM) recommendations for developing and maintaining muscular&#xD;
      fitness in adults.Patients will be required to exercise for 60 minutes, three days a week for&#xD;
      12 weeks. Patient's attendance to the exercise program (compliance) will be registered by the&#xD;
      physical therapists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and Functional Activity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary (main) outcome measurement will be the self-reported functional outcome measure,&#xD;
      the disease-specific questionnaire Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      Index (WOMAC). WOMAC is found to be a valid, reliable and responsive outcome measure in&#xD;
      patients with hip OA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-reported Physical Activity Score for the Elderly (PASE) will be used to record the&#xD;
      individuals activity level prior to inclusion and at follow-up intervals. Hip pain will be&#xD;
      recorded on a visual analogue scale (VAS) rating from 0 to 100 mm; 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and&#xD;
      100 represents &quot;as much pain he/she can possibly imagine&quot;. The pain will be recorded after&#xD;
      the 6 minutes walking test (se below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six minutes walking tests (Enright, 2003): Observed functional capacity and cardiovascular&#xD;
      fitness will be assessed by a six minute walk test. This test has been reliability estimated&#xD;
      for older adults and validated for older adults and individuals with total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health related quality of life and pain management: Quality of life will be assessed by using&#xD;
      the self-administered generic questionnaire 36-item short-form health survey (SF-36) version&#xD;
      2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hip Biomechanics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Kinematic data will be collected using Qualisys pro-reflex motion analysis system with eight&#xD;
      cameras at a sampling frequency of 240 Hz and synchronized with two force platforms sampling&#xD;
      at a rate of 960 Hz (AMTI Model LG6).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to walk along a 17 m walkway in which two force plates are&#xD;
      embedded. Speed will be measured by photoelectric beams located 3.06 m apart, midway along&#xD;
      the walkway. Eight to ten walking trials will be averaged for each subject. Kinematic and&#xD;
      kinetic variables will include hip, knee, and ankle angles and moments, in the sagittal,&#xD;
      frontal and transverse planes. The setup and the analysis software that we used are the same&#xD;
      as our collaborative group at the University of Delaware use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balance(Suni et al. 1998):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Static balance will be tested by one-leg standing. The subject is advised to stand as still&#xD;
      as possible and center of pressure will be registered on a force plate (AMTI Model LG6). The&#xD;
      test is developed for adults and has been used in several former studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dynamic balance will be registered by the patient performing a two-legged raise from seated&#xD;
      position to standing position on the force plate (Mizner &amp;Snyder-Mackler). Center of&#xD;
      pressure, kinematic, and kinetic data will be registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength: Isokinetic muscle strength will be tested in Technogym REV 9000 (Gambettola,&#xD;
      Italia) and measured as peak torque at 60°s-1 for hip flexion/extension, knee&#xD;
      flexion/extension and ankle flexion/extension. Muscle strength for hip abduction will be&#xD;
      conducted isometrically with a dynamometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Fitness (Åstrand &amp; Rodahl, 1986):&#xD;
&#xD;
      will be tested by a sub-maximal bicycle ergometer test according to the method described by&#xD;
      Åstrand &amp; Rodahl. The load will be adjusted to each subject. Results will be corrected for&#xD;
      age and gender and expressed in ml O2 / kg / min.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of motion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      will be registered with a plastic goniometer. Flexion, abduction, and adduction is registered&#xD;
      in supine position, with a fixation of the contralateral leg. Internal and external rotation&#xD;
      is registered in prone position with fixation over buttocks. Extension is registered&#xD;
      according to Thomas test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collections and Follow-Up In the randomized controlled trial (Aim 1 and 2), data will be&#xD;
      collected at inclusion, after the 15 weeks intervention period, and at follow- ups at 6&#xD;
      months, 1 year, and 2 years. Data from all outcome measurements will be collected from all&#xD;
      patients at all follow-ups, except for the gait-analysis data (kinematic and kinetic data)&#xD;
      (Aim 2). These data will be collected at inclusion and after the intervention period (15&#xD;
      weeks).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power Calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The WOMAC Index will be the main outcome measurement in the RCT. Power calculations based on&#xD;
      a standard deviation of 23 mm, and a minimum clinically important difference of 15 mm between&#xD;
      groups calculated that there is a need for 49 patients in each group. To account for possible&#xD;
      drop-outs, 110 patients will be included in the RCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Personnel responsible for the intervention will not be involved in data collection. Physical&#xD;
      therapists collecting data will be blinded for patients' group allocation. A research&#xD;
      coordinate person, not involved in any part of the study intervention or data collections,&#xD;
      will be responsible for randomization procedures (give subjects information about group&#xD;
      allocation)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data in the randomized controlled trial will be analyzed both according to the intention to&#xD;
      treat principles and additional analysis for the compliers adhering to the exercise protocol&#xD;
      at a cut-off value of 24 or more training sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of Complications, Drop-Outs and Compliance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications and drop-outs will be registered by persons responsible for data collection.&#xD;
      There will be used intention to treat analysis. Compliance to the patient education and the&#xD;
      exercise protocol will be registered by the physical therapists responsible for the&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients and control subjects will receive written and oral information about the study&#xD;
      and sign an informed consent before inclusion. The project will be performed according to&#xD;
      recommendations of the Helsinki Declaration. Approval is obtained from the Regional Committee&#xD;
      of Medical Research Ethics.&#xD;
