  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP) is a common complaint in childhood. Identification of the&#xD;
      processes that maintain illness is important.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to get more knowledge about characteristics of children with&#xD;
      recurrent abdominal pain and their parents, and about the course of their pain. These results&#xD;
      may be important to identify children who need treatment.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recurrent abdominal pain (RAP), mainly constituted by functional gastrointestinal disorders&#xD;
      (FGID), affects a significant number of children, and is a result of a complex interaction&#xD;
      between biopsychosocial factors. Despite the seemingly benign nature of RAP, in some children&#xD;
      RAP is associated with school absenteeism, functional impairment and frequent doctor visits.&#xD;
      Identification of the processes that maintain illness is important. These results may be&#xD;
      important to identify children who need treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIMS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study are to characterize children with RAP (in four out-patient clinics)&#xD;
      and their parents, describe outcome and determine predictors of persistent RAP in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      150 pediatric patients (4-15 years), their parents and teachers. Consecutive new patients&#xD;
      referred to four pediatric out-patients clinics for evaluation of abdominal pain (primary&#xD;
      complaint). Patients with RAP (abdominal pain at least once a month, in three consecutive&#xD;
      months during the last year, and whose pains are severe enough to affect daily activity) are&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: A prospective cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEASUREMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All pediatric patients will undergo a complete physical examination emphasizing diagnosing&#xD;
      organic illness and FGID according to the international ROME classification. Routine&#xD;
      laboratory will be done. A protocol to identify somatic causes is part of the study. In&#xD;
      addition, parents will complete validated questionnaires regarding their child's&#xD;
      physical/psychological health, temperamental characteristics and social skills and also&#xD;
      psychosocial conditions concerning them selves. Self-report regarding the same aspects will&#xD;
      be obtained from children above 8-9 years.&#xD;

      antiendomysial and antigliadin antibodies (IgG and IgA) and anti-tissue transglutaminase&#xD;
      antibodies for celiac disease. Furthermore, urine analyses for protein, blood and and&#xD;
      leucocytes, three stool specimen for occult blood and one stool specimen for quantification&#xD;
