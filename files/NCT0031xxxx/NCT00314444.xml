      This study will examine whether biofeedback treatment is effective in lessening or stopping&#xD;
      movement symptoms in people with psychogenic movement disorder. People with this condition&#xD;
      have increased or decreased movements that are not under their control and are not associated&#xD;
      with any know problem with the nervous system. Biofeedback is a type of therapy that uses&#xD;
      electronic instruments to monitor breathing and heart rate. This treatment has been effective&#xD;
      in patients with anxiety and panic attacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People 18 years of age and older diagnosed with psychogenic movement disorder may be eligible&#xD;
      for this study. Candidates are screened with a neurological history, physical examination and&#xD;
      psychiatric evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants come to the NIH Clinical Center for nine 1-hour test sessions over an 8-week&#xD;
      period for the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 (two visits):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' movements are videotaped while they sit, stand and walk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients train on RESPeRATE device, a computerized musical biofeedback device to help&#xD;
           slow theirs breathing rate. The device has three components: a computerized module,&#xD;
           earphones, and a chest strap holding a breath sensor. The patients put the elastic strap&#xD;
           around their chest, put on the earphones, and sit in a chair. The device monitors and&#xD;
           analyzes their breathing to create a melody composed of two distinct tones - one for&#xD;
           inhalation and one for exhalation. Patients are instructed to match their breathing to&#xD;
           the tones, which gradually slow until they are breathing at a slower, therapeutic rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' breathing is monitored and analyzed for information on breathing pattern and&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients complete questionnaires on level of relaxation before and after RESPeRATE&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients take the RESPeRATE device home to use for two 10-minute practice sessions per&#xD;
           day. They complete relaxation questionnaires before and after each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Weeks 2-7:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' progress is monitored and reviewed from the previous week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' breathing is monitored and analyzed for information on breathing pattern and&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients complete questionnaires on level of relaxation before and after RESPeRATE&#xD;
           training.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients are observed for 10 minutes while using the RESPeRATE device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 8:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' progress is monitored and reviewed from the previous week&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients' breathing is monitored and analyzed for information on breathing pattern and&#xD;
           rate.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To apply respiratory biofeedback to patients with Psychogenic Movement Disorders (PMD) with a&#xD;
      goal of decreasing involuntary movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients diagnosed with &quot;clinically definite&quot; PMD based on the Fahn-Williams scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Open-label pilot study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate a possible decrease or resolution in involuntary movements caused by PMD as&#xD;
           measured by the Psychogenic Movement Disorder Scale. Videotaping will be performed pre-&#xD;
           and post-treatment and the videos will be evaluated by movement disorder specialists who&#xD;
           are blinded to the pre-treatment or post-treatment condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate if respiratory biofeedback is an effective treatment for patients with PMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To retrospectively evaluate the components of anxiety and depression with responders&#xD;
           versus non-responders.&#xD;
