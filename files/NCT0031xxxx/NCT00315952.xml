  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      University of Pittsburgh Medical Center (UPMC) diabetes research physicians are studying the&#xD;
      action in muscle tissue of &quot;inhaled&quot; insulin (Exubera®) and &quot;infused&quot; (intravenous or IV)&#xD;
      insulin on blood sugar control in people with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetics often take&#xD;
      2-4 shots of insulin every day. Exubera may offer an alternative to these insulin injections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A dry powder insulin formulation delivered by an aerosol inhaler has been in clinical&#xD;
      development for use in types 1 and 2 diabetes mellitus (DM) and just recently (1-27-06)&#xD;
      received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the clinical treatment&#xD;
      of diabetes. Administration of insulin without the need for subcutaneous (SC) injection is an&#xD;
      attractive alternative for patients with diabetes. There are preclinical and clinical data&#xD;
      that indicate inhalation of insulin results in a more potent effect on glucose disposal and a&#xD;
      lower fasting glucose than is attained with equivalent dosing of SC or intravenous (IV)&#xD;
      insulin. The physiological mechanism(s) are unclear, but occur even when matched for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current proposal seeks primarily to more fully delineate whether there are physiological&#xD;
      differences in the metabolic effects of inhaled compared to IV infused insulin, giving IV&#xD;
      insulin to match the pharmacokinetics (PK) achieved with inhaled insulin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 3 specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The first aim is to establish a protocol for matching the PK of inhaled insulin with the&#xD;
           PK of intravenously infused insulin. An infusion algorithm has been developed and will&#xD;
           be tested and refined in healthy volunteers (n = 3-5), and will be used for the&#xD;
           physiological studies (aims) outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The second aim is to perform Positron Emission Tomography (PET) imaging of [18F]-FDG&#xD;
           uptake by muscle, following administration of a single dose of inhaled compared to&#xD;
           infused insulin. Volunteers with type 1 DM (n =12) will be studied, serving as his/her&#xD;
           within-subject control, under each condition of insulin administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In these type 1 diabetes mellitus (type 1 DM) volunteers, we will test the hypothesis&#xD;
           that a single dose of inhaled versus infused insulin, matched for arterial&#xD;
           concentrations, causes greater stimulation of muscle glucose uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The third aim is to determine overnight rates of glucose production and plasma glucose&#xD;
           after a single pre-dinner dose of inhaled compared to IV infused insulin. The same 12&#xD;
           volunteers studied for Aim 2 will be studied the evening preceding the PET imaging&#xD;
           studies and will serve as his/her within-subject control, under each condition of&#xD;
           insulin administration.&#xD;
