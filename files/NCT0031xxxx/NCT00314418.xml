  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Colonoscopy is usually associated with coiling (&quot;looping&quot;) of the colonoscope (instrument&#xD;
      used for the procedure) in parts of the bowel. This is the main reason for patient discomfort&#xD;
      and lengthens the duration of the procedure. Minimizing the coiling of the colonoscope would&#xD;
      decrease the duration, and improve the efficiency and tolerability of the procedure and have&#xD;
      a positive impact on colon cancer screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this study is to compare the time it takes for the colonoscope to reach&#xD;
      the end of the colon when the patient is lying on the belly versus the left side (usual) at&#xD;
      the start of the procedure. Patients who have medical conditions that may be affected by&#xD;
      lying on their belly or those who cannot comfortably lie on the belly will be excluded from&#xD;
      the study. Changes in patient position and use of abdominal pressure (commonly given by the&#xD;
      endoscopy nurse during the procedure) will be permitted as necessary and determined by the&#xD;
      endoscopist. The endoscopist will also retain the decision to discontinue the patient's&#xD;
      participation from the study for any medical reason. After the procedure the patient will be&#xD;
      monitored in the usual manner and asked to fill out a &quot;satisfaction survey&quot; (24 hours after).&#xD;

      1. Principal investigator: Shivakumar Vignesh MD, Gastroenterology Attending Physician, VACHS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy with the patient in the prone position may reduce colonoscopy duration and may&#xD;
      reduce patient discomfort by a reduction in coiling of the colonoscope with a mobile part of&#xD;
      the bowel, decreased need for abdominal pressure and less sedation may improve the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine if starting colonoscopy with the patient in the prone position will&#xD;
      reduce cecal intubation time (time to reach the cecum) and total sedation requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: 120 adult male, patients referred of outpatient colonoscopy will be the study&#xD;
      subjects and controls. We do 15-18 colonoscopies a day and assuming half that number meet&#xD;
      criteria for inclusion and consent to the study we will be able to recruit 120 patients in 6&#xD;
      months or less. Our records indicate more than 1000 colonoscopies are performed in a&#xD;
      six-month period. If we conservatively estimate 10% ineligible patients &gt; (n=900 remaining),&#xD;
      50% refusal (n=450 remaining), and enrollment on 4 of 5 weekdays (n=360 remaining), the&#xD;
      six-month period would provide adequate sample size. The study would end if the target sample&#xD;
      size is reached early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: All adult, male patients presenting for outpatient colonoscopy. Patients&#xD;
      who have had colonoscopies in the past and those who present for their first colonoscopy will&#xD;
      be invited to participate in the study. It will not matter if it is their first or repeat&#xD;
      colonoscopy as they will be randomized to either position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Severe obstructive lung disease requiring home oxygen, congestive heart&#xD;
      failure not adequately managed, other conditions causing breathing difficulty, massive&#xD;
      ascites (fluid accumulation causing a tensely distended abdomen), or inability to lie prone&#xD;
      for any reason. Patients allergic to Versed or Fentanyl will be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All female patients will be excluded as they comprise less than 2% of our colonoscopies and&#xD;
      we don't routinely check if female patients are pregnant and the safety of lying prone during&#xD;
      colonoscopy in pregnancy is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No vulnerable population(s) will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection: At the time of presentation for outpatient colonoscopy, patients satisfying the&#xD;
      inclusion and exclusion criteria will be educated about the purpose, risks and benefits of&#xD;
      the study and informed consent will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomized using a permuted block scheme with equal allocation among&#xD;
      treatment arms. Treatment will be initiated immediately following random assignment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistician will release the randomization scheme and assignments to Karl Larson PA (not&#xD;
      involved in the study) who will inform the PI of the study assignment after patients are&#xD;
      consented, prior to the colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: For our single center (VACHS) study we plan to enroll a total of 120 patients&#xD;
      among the patients presenting for outpatient colonoscopy, 60 in each arm. Dr.Vignesh (PI)&#xD;
      will select patients by applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria, review their VA&#xD;
      medical record, take a history and a physical (done before every colonoscopy) and at the same&#xD;
      time will obtain the consent for both the colonoscopy and the study. They will be randomized&#xD;
      using a permuted block randomization scheme and allocation concealed till the start of&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: Single-center (VACHS), Prospective, randomized, controlled, non-blinded (The&#xD;
      GI fellow doing the data analysis, will be blinded to the assignment) study of positioning&#xD;
      for colonoscopy in veterans undergoing outpatient colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Basis of sample size calculation: The national average time for cecal intubation is 15&#xD;
      minutes. A reduction in the colonoscopy duration by 3 minutes would be clinically meaningful&#xD;
      and reduce cost. We do 15-20 outpatient colonoscopies in two rooms with one nurse per room&#xD;
      daily at the West Haven VA and a reduction of 3 minutes per colonoscopy will save 45-60&#xD;
      minutes per day and this does not include the potential reduction in recovery time from using&#xD;
      less sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations, using nQuery Advisor, assuming 15 minutes for a standard procedure,&#xD;
      and 12 minutes for a prone procedure (common standard &gt; deviation of 5 minutes); the&#xD;
      difference in duration of 2 minutes has important public health implications and was&#xD;
      considered clinically meaningful in other studies of modifications in Colonoscopy procedures&#xD;
      (4,5,6,7,8,9). Using a two-tail alpha error of 0.05, and beta error of 0.10 (power &gt;90% ), 60&#xD;
      patients in each arm would be required (120 total). The study would end if the target sample&#xD;
      size is reached early.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bowel preparation, type of colonoscopes, techniques (including polypectomy) will be the&#xD;
      same as our routine practice, they are mentioned below to be complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who undergo outpatient colonoscopy at our institution receive the following as&#xD;
      bowel preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clear liquid diet 24 hours prior to procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. One gallon of Golytely the day prior to colonoscopy starting at noon.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patients with serum creatinine under 2.0 to drink 300 cc of magnesium citrate following&#xD;
           the Golytely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard adult colonoscopes only will be used. Polyps will be removed with snare polypectomy&#xD;
      or biopsy upon withdrawal of the colonoscope from the cecum as is the normal practice. In the&#xD;
      event of failure to reach the cecum with the standard adult colonoscope, a variable-stiffness&#xD;
      colonoscope (adult or pediatric) will be used (4, 6). In patients with severe stenosing&#xD;
      diverticular disease, with difficulty in navigating the affected segment a pediatric variable&#xD;
      stiffness colonoscope will be used (5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midazolam and Fentanyl will be the only medications used, their doses depending on the&#xD;
      patient's vital signs and discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vital signs will be monitored every 5 minutes during the procedure. All patients will be&#xD;
      placed on oxygen 2 liters via nasal cannula prior to commencement of colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After starting the procedure changes in patient's position or abdominal pressure will be&#xD;
      documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data and demographic information including height, weight, age, co-morbid illnesses&#xD;
      and history of abdominal surgery will be collected from each patient to enable comparison&#xD;
      between the two arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After starting the procedure if the patient's position is altered or abdominal pressure is&#xD;
      used to help with the colonoscopy it will be documented as &quot;position change&quot; and &quot;abdominal&#xD;
      pressure&quot; but there will be no crossover. Our study is not powered to measure differences&#xD;
      between &quot;position changes&quot; or &quot;abdominal pressure&quot; these will merely be described. The&#xD;
      patients whose position is altered will be analyzed based on the original group assignment&#xD;
      (Intent to treat analysis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of colonoscopy being rare (Bleeding &lt; 1%) and perforation (&lt; 0.02%) will be&#xD;
      described if they occur but our study is not powered to analyze them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Time to cecal intubation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) Total medication (Midazolam and Fentanyl) dose dichotomized to low ( Midazolam 4mg IV or&#xD;
      less, Fentanyl 200 mcg IV or less) or high (Midazolam&gt; 4 mg IV and Fentanyl &gt;200 mcg IV).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The time to cecal intubation will be measured and a t-test will be used to compare the&#xD;
      difference between the mean duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total opiate doses will be recorded and dichotomized to low ( Midazolam 4mg IV or less,&#xD;
      Fentanyl 200 mcg IV or less) or high (Midazolam&gt; 4 mg IV and Fentanyl &gt;200 mcg IV) compared&#xD;
      using the Chi-square test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prone position (lying on the belly) does not increase risk of complications based on our&#xD;
      experience. We have done hundreds of colonoscopies safely in the prone position. The prone&#xD;
      position with the patient's head turned to one side may reduce aspiration risk as it&#xD;
      facilitates the drainage of secretions via the mouth. By applying our exclusion criteria we&#xD;
      do not offer the study to a patient with a medical condition that is affected by lying on the&#xD;
      belly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopies are done with &quot;conscious sedation&quot;, last 30 minutes and have the same stringent&#xD;
      cardio respiratory monitoring. For this study we will follow our standard continuous&#xD;
      cardio-respiratory monitoring, blood pressure measurements every 5 minutes. We also&#xD;
      administer Oxygen 2 liters by nasal cannula routinely. We have an adverse event form to&#xD;
      document any cases of cardio-respiratory depression or any other adverse event in a procedure&#xD;
      involving conscious sedation. The physicians involved in conscious sedation have been&#xD;
      certified in a &quot;Conscious sedation and airway management&quot; course conducted by Yale New Haven&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent will be obtained for the colonoscopy outlining the risks and separately for&#xD;
      study using the VA research consent form. The consents will be obtained in the ambulatory&#xD;
      procedure unit after the patients are prepared for the colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We strictly adhere to HIPAA regulations in our daily practice. The information obtained in&#xD;
      the study and the patient's medical record will be de-identified and accessible to the&#xD;
      investigators mentioned above exclusively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your research records will be kept as confidential as possible and only the&#xD;
      gastroenterologists and the endoscopy nurses participating in your case will have access to&#xD;
      the information obtained for the study. Only a code number will identify your research&#xD;
      records. The code number will not be based on any information that could be used to identify&#xD;
      you. The master list linking names to code numbers will be kept separately from the research&#xD;
      data. All research information will be kept in locked files at all times. Only authorized&#xD;
      research staff will have access to the information gathered in this study. A note describing&#xD;
      your participation in this research study will be placed in your VA medical record.&#xD;
