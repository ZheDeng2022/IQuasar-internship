      This study will examine how the brain makes involuntary spasms and contractions in patients&#xD;
      with focal hand dystonia (FHD). Patients with dystonia have muscle spasms that cause&#xD;
      uncontrolled twisting and repetitive movement or abnormal postures. In FHD, only the hand is&#xD;
      involved. The study will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI, see below) to study&#xD;
      which areas of the brain are primarily affected in FHD and better understand how brain&#xD;
      changes produce dystonia symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Normal right-handed volunteers and patients with FHD who are 18-65 years of age may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical history and physical and&#xD;
      neurological examinations. Women who can become pregnant have a urine pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants undergo fMRI. This test uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to&#xD;
      obtain images of body organs and tissues. The subject lies on a table that is moved into the&#xD;
      scanner (a metal cylinder), wearing earplugs to muffle loud knocking and thumping sounds that&#xD;
      occur during the scanning process. The procedure lasts about 90 minutes, during which time&#xD;
      the patient is asked to lie still for 10-15 minutes at a time. During the procedure, subjects&#xD;
      are asked to perform some tasks, including writing, tapping with their hand, and drawing in a&#xD;
      zigzag motion. Each task is performed using the right hand, left hand and right foot.&#xD;

      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Writer's cramp, a form of focal hand dystonia, is the most frequently observed task specific&#xD;
      dystonia. Symptoms of writer's cramp often appear as soon as the pen is picked up, or after a&#xD;
      few words of writing. Patients with simple writer's cramp have difficulties writing, but&#xD;
      carry out other tasks with the affected hand without spasms. Little is known about why the&#xD;
      hand spasms when writing, while performing other tasks normally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to identify brain areas of activation associated specifically&#xD;
      with the task of handwriting with the dystonic hand, in patients with simple writer's cramp.&#xD;
      Simple writer's cramp can be defined by a patient exhibiting the symptoms only when writing&#xD;
      and symptoms are not present in any other task performance. Specifically for this study,&#xD;
      patients should be able to write for 20 seconds consecutively in a run. We plan to use&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to identify the pattern of blood oxygenation&#xD;
      level-dependent (BOLD) activation in the brain when different tasks are performed by&#xD;
      different limbs in healthy volunteers and patients with focal hand dystonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be conducted using 22 patients diagnosed with simple writer's cramp and 32&#xD;
      healthy volunteers matched for age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a block design in functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), we will examine the&#xD;
      brain activity of patients and healthy volunteers while they execute three tasks: writing,&#xD;
      tapping and a zigzagging motion, with three separate limbs: the dystonic hand, the opposite&#xD;
      hand, and the right foot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The changes in signal intensity of the brain activity correlated with the motor program (task&#xD;
      of handwriting) and effector (dystonic hand) will be collected and analyzed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings we expect to obtain with this experiment may contribute to basic knowledge of&#xD;
      the linkage between task specificity and the dystonic hand, and may provide a better&#xD;
      understanding of the pathophysiology of writer's cramp.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Focal Dystonia Subjects must be:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Right hand dominant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Between 18 and 65 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with mild, simple focal hand dystonia. For this study mild, simple focal&#xD;
             hand dystonia suggests that the patient does not present symptoms when performing&#xD;
             tasks other than writing. Additionally, the patient should be able to write for 20&#xD;
             seconds consecutively&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to abstain from alcohol 48 hours prior to the study&#xD;
