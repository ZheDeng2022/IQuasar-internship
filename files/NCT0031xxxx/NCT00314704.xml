      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vasopressor agents are commonly used to correct hypotension in patients with acute&#xD;
      circulatory failure. Their variable alpha, beta, or dopaminergic receptor stimulation, may&#xD;
      result in different hemodynamic and metabolic effects. Several experimental and human studies&#xD;
      have indicated that dopamine and norepinephrine may have different effects on the kidney, the&#xD;
      splanchnic region or the pituitary axis, but the implications of these findings have not been&#xD;
      assessed. Hence, both agents are widely used, and several consensus or expert recommendations&#xD;
      still recommend the use of both agents 1,2. An observational study has reported that dopamine&#xD;
      and epinephrine may be associated with a higher mortality rate than norepinephrine 3. In&#xD;
      addition, The results of the SOAP study indicated that dopamine may be associated with higher&#xD;
      mortality rates than norepinephrine, but various uncontrolled factors may have influenced&#xD;
      these results. Therefore, we will address this issue in a prospective, randomized, double&#xD;
      blind study. We hypothesize that both agents have similar effects on survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective, randomized, double blind, multicenter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 1600 consecutive patients with hypotension requiring the administration of&#xD;
      vasopressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation: Calculation is based on the results of the SOAP study (mortality 43% with&#xD;
      dopamine and 36% with norepinephrine), using a two-sided analysis, with a significant p value&#xD;
      at 0.05 and a power of 80%, 765 patients are needed in each group. About 40 centers will be&#xD;
      recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean arterial pressure less than 70 mmHg or systolic pressure less than 100 mmHg persisting&#xD;
      despite adequate fluid loading (in example with at least 1000 mL crystalloid or 500 ml&#xD;
      colloid) unless central venous pressure (CVP) or pulmonary artery occluded pressure (PAOP)&#xD;
      are elevated (e.g. CVP&gt; 12 mmHg or PAOP &gt; 14 mmHg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Serious arrhythmia such as rapid atrial fibrillation (&gt; 160/min) or ventricular&#xD;
           tachycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Brain death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open label administration of dopamine, norepinephrine, epinephrine or phenylephrine for&#xD;
           more than 4hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized immediately, with the use of sealed envelopes placed near the&#xD;
      supplies of dopamine and norepinephrine. If the patient is already being treated with one&#xD;
      agent, randomization can still take place provided that it is within a 4 hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent will be obtained from the patient before entering the study, if possible, or from the&#xD;
      next of kin as soon as possible after starting vasopressor therapy. Indeed, in such cases,&#xD;
      vasopressor therapy should anyway be started, either with dopamine or with norepinephrine,&#xD;
      and these 2 therapies are currently equally valid 1st choices. As soon as possible, the next&#xD;
      of kin will be informed and deferred consent obtained. If the patient recovers, and is able&#xD;
      to consent, consent will then be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to local Ethical Committee, oral or signed consents will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure goal: defined by the physician in charge, according to each unit's&#xD;
      recommendations&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of vasoactive drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blind administration of a solution of norepinephrine or dopamine contained either in&#xD;
      vials or syringes according to the ICU's protocol (see appendices I and II for vial and&#xD;
      syringe preparations). Each solution will be labeled with its randomly allocated number and&#xD;
      will be prepared by the nurses in charge. The rate of administration of the blind solution&#xD;
      will be determined according to a scale and using the estimated body weight. The recommended&#xD;
      steps for increasing or decreasing the doses of the blinded solution are calculated to be&#xD;
      equivalent to 2 µg/kg.min for dopamine and 0.02 mcg/kg.min for norepinephrine, the&#xD;
      investigator being free to use multiples of this increment in case of emergency. The maximal&#xD;
      dose with the 2 agents will be 20 µg/kg.min for dopamine and 0.19 mcg/kg.min for&#xD;
      norepinephrine (these doses have been shown to have similar effects on mean arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is already treated with open label vasopressors at baseline, the blinded&#xD;
      solution will be rapidly incremented, and, if possible, the open label vasopressor agent will&#xD;
      be decreased. If this open label vasopressor consisted in dopamine and if this agent cannot&#xD;
      be fully weaned after the introduction of the blinded solution, the open label dopamine will&#xD;
      be replaced by an open label norepinephrine infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the maximal dose of the blinded solution is achieved, an open label perfusion of&#xD;
      norepinephrine can be added to achieve the desired blood pressure. Epinephrine or vasopressin&#xD;
      may be used only as rescue therapy. Weaning of vasopressor agents will begin by weaning of&#xD;
      the open label norepinephrine, followed by weaning of the blinded solution. In case of&#xD;
      recurrence of hypotension, the blinded solution will be resumed first (maximal dose with the&#xD;
      2 agents will be 20 µg/kg.min for dopamine and 0.19 mcg/kg.min for norepinephrine) and if&#xD;
      needed an open label solution of norepinephrine may be added. Weaning of the vasopressors&#xD;
      will be performed as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dobutamine, dopexamine, and inhibitors of phosphodiesterase III can be used, if needed, to&#xD;
      optimize cardiac output according to local practices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General therapeutic guidelines:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All therapies will be performed according to local guidelines. The choice of sedative agents,&#xD;
      antibiotics, fluids, transfusion threshold, ventilatory modes,…. , will be left to the&#xD;
      attending physicians. Likewise, the administration of agents like corticosteroids or&#xD;
      drotrecogin-alpha activated (Xigris) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization by blocks for each participating ICU, using a computer generated list to&#xD;
      allocate treatments A or B, put in sealed envelopes near the drug supplies. In each ICU,&#xD;
      sealed envelopes including treatment allocation and a five digit number will be available.&#xD;
      The envelope will be opened by the person responsible for preparation of the dopamine and&#xD;
      norepinephrine solutions. The random number and treatment allocation will be written on a&#xD;
      hidden book, available only for the person responsible for preparation of the dopamine and&#xD;
      norepinephrine solutions. The doctors and other nurses will be kept blinded to treatment&#xD;
      allocation. On patients' charts only the rate of administration and the dilution (simple or&#xD;
      double) of the solution will be written.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preparation of the solutions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The solutions of dopamine or norepinephrine will be prepared by the nurse in charge of the&#xD;
      patient. The five digit number (allocated by randomization) will be written on the bag. See&#xD;
      appendices I and II for details regarding the preparation of the solutions. Different&#xD;
      concentrations of these solutions are provided, the choice of the concentration of the&#xD;
      solution will be left to the physician in charge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of the end of the shock period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shock will be considered as having resolved when the investigational drug can be stopped for&#xD;
      more than 12 hours.&#xD;
