      Official Title: Compassionate Use of Catheter Thrombectomy (Aspirex 11F) in Patients With&#xD;
      Massive Pulmonary Embolism&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients &gt;/= 18 years of age with massive pulmonary embolism suitable for&#xD;
      mechanical thrombectomy with Aspirex 11F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment: Aspirex 11F assisted thrombectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      _________&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was terminated early. After having treated seven (7) patients, it was decided in&#xD;
      April 2007 that the handling characteristics of the test device should be upgraded before&#xD;
      continuing the trial as planned. Therefore, the study was long-term interrupted and finally&#xD;
      terminated early. This decision was made by the sponsor in full accordance with the principal&#xD;
      investigator. Further studies shall be conducted to show effectiveness and safety of the&#xD;
      Aspirex PE catheter thrombectomy device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      _________&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Thrombectomy with the Aspirex catheter device is associated with an immediate decrease&#xD;
           in mean pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) and pulmonary vascular resistance (PVP).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Aspirex thrombectomy catheter does not cause perforation/dissection to treated and&#xD;
           untreated cardiovascular structures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Thrombectomy with the Aspirex catheter device is associated with improved flow in the&#xD;
           treated main and lobar pulmonary arteries as assessed by the angiographic Miller index.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. There will be no significant mechanical haemolysis as assessed by plasma free&#xD;
           haemoglobin levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In-hospital mortality will not exceed 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A prospective international multicenter non-randomized registry assessing the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of the Aspirex 11F mechanical thrombectomy device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: Maximum of 50 patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with massive pulmonary embolism and cardiogenic shock with failed thrombolysis&#xD;
           or at least contraindication for lysis.&#xD;

&#xD;
      I. BACKGROUND AND SIGNIFICANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Historical Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute pulmonary embolism (PE) is a potentially life-threatening disease with an overall&#xD;
      3-month mortality rate that exceeds 15%, with right ventricular (RV) dysfunction as the most&#xD;
      common cause of death (1). The 30-day mortality rate in patients with massive PE, defined as&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock or a systemic systolic pressure &lt; 90 mm Hg, exceeds 30%. In patients with&#xD;
      massive PE, systemic thrombolysis (2) or surgical embolectomy (3-5) in addition to&#xD;
      anticoagulation may be life-saving, facilitating rapid reversal of RV failure and cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock. Catheter-directed thrombolysis aims to accelerate clot lysis and achieve rapid&#xD;
      reperfusion of pulmonary arteries (6). Rapid recanalization of pulmonary arteries by&#xD;
      thrombolysis (7,8) or embolectomy (4) may improve functional class, decrease the risk of&#xD;
      recurrence, and prevent chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension. However, approximately&#xD;
      35% patients are not eligible for thrombolysis because of major contraindications, such as&#xD;
      recent surgery, trauma, or cancer (9). PE thrombolysis is accompanied by a particularly high&#xD;
      risk of bleeding complications. Among 304 patients from the International Cooperative&#xD;
      Pulmonary Embolism registry (ICOPER) who received PE thrombolysis, 66 (21.7%) suffered major&#xD;
      bleeding and 9 (3.0%) had intracranial bleeding (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Few tertiary care centers offer emergency surgical embolectomy with round-the-clock&#xD;
      availability (3). This operation mandates a median sternotomy, circulatory arrest with&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass, and incision of the main pulmonary arteries. In the 2 largest PE&#xD;
      registries, surgical embolectomy was used in only 1% of patients with massive PE and&#xD;
      cardiogenic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only alternative to thrombolysis or surgical embolectomy for reversing PE-related right&#xD;
      heart failure and cardiogenic shock is percutaneous catheter thrombectomy (10,11). Catheter&#xD;
      thrombectomy is particularly important when contraindications to thrombolysis are present or&#xD;
      when surgical embolectomy is not feasible or not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ideal percutaneous PE thrombectomy catheter should be: 1) highly maneuverable to allow&#xD;
      rapid right heart passage and advancement into major pulmonary arteries, 2) effective in&#xD;
      removing obstructing thrombi from major pulmonary arteries to facilitate rapid improvement in&#xD;
      hemodynamics, reversing right heart failure and cardiogenic shock, and 3) safe without&#xD;
      causing damage to cardiac structures and pulmonary arteries, and without causing significant&#xD;
      blood loss, distal thrombus embolization, and mechanical hemolysis. An ideal PE thrombectomy&#xD;
      catheter device is currently not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Greenfield suction embolectomy catheter has been available the longest and is the only PE&#xD;
      catheter device approved by the Food and Drug Administration (12,13). However, its&#xD;
      limitations include a very large catheter size, requiring a surgical cutdown at the venous&#xD;
      puncture site, as well as its stiffness, with difficulty manipulating the catheter to the&#xD;
      desired location within the pulmonary vascular tree. In addition, there is a substantial risk&#xD;
      of re-embolization because the aspiration pressure may not be sufficient to hold the thrombus&#xD;
      in place while removing the catheter with the thrombus trapped within the suction cap.&#xD;
      Thrombus fragmentation without embolectomy using balloon angioplasty or a pigtail rotational&#xD;
      catheter has also been reported (15-17). Macroembolization, however, may cause further&#xD;
      deterioration of hemodynamics when a large centrally located thrombus breaks and embolizes&#xD;
      into a previously non-obstructed lobar branch (17). Several mechanical or rheolytic&#xD;
      embolectomy devices, including Angiojet (Possis, Minneapolis, MN), Amplatz &quot;clot buster&quot;&#xD;
      (BARD-Microvena, White Bear Lake, MN), or Hydrolyser (Cordis, Warren, NJ), were not designed&#xD;
      for the use in the large-sized main pulmonary arteries but were investigated in small PE&#xD;
      cohort studies (18-23). These catheter devices have limited efficacy to treat massive PE and&#xD;
      are plagued by complications that include mechanical hemolysis, and macro- or&#xD;
      microembolization (23). Mechanical hemolysis occurs when macerated blood or thrombus is not&#xD;
      removed by the catheter. Transient mechanical hemolysis of 24-48 hours duration was reported&#xD;
      following catheter thrombectomy, particularly with the Amplatz device and with hydrodynamic&#xD;
      devices such as the Angiojet catheter (23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter thrombectomy is used in only up to 5% of patients with massive PE and cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock (1). In summary, potentially life-saving therapy, including surgical embolectomy or&#xD;
      catheter thrombectomy is withheld in up to 30% of patients with massive PE and&#xD;
      contraindication to thrombolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) The Aspirex PE catheter thrombectomy device&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ideal percutaneous PE thrombectomy catheter should be: 1) highly maneuverable to allow&#xD;
      rapid right heart passage and advancement into major pulmonary arteries, 2) effective in&#xD;
      removing obstructing thrombi from major pulmonary arteries to facilitate rapid improvement in&#xD;
      hemodynamics, reversing right heart failure and cardiogenic shock, and 3) safe without&#xD;
      causing damage to cardiac structures and pulmonary arteries, and without causing significant&#xD;
      blood loss, distal thrombus embolization, and mechanical hemolysis. An ideal PE thrombectomy&#xD;
      catheter device is currently not available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Aspirex catheter thrombectomy device (Straub Medical, Wangs, Switzerland) was&#xD;
      specifically designed and developed for percutaneous interventional treatment of PE in&#xD;
      pulmonary arteries, ranging from 6-14 mm in caliber. The central part of the catheter system&#xD;
      is a high-speed rotational coil within the catheter body that: 1) creates negative pressure&#xD;
      through an L-shaped aspiration port at the catheter tip, 2) macerates aspirated thrombus, and&#xD;
      3) removes macerated thrombus. The aspiration capacity of the Aspirex device was adjusted to&#xD;
      remove thrombus from obstructed major pulmonary arteries and to minimize the risk of vascular&#xD;
      collapse and vessel wall engagement. This was achieved by adjusting the caliber of the&#xD;
      device, the pitch of the rotational coil, motor speed, and size or configuration of the&#xD;
      aspiration port at the catheter tip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aspirated blood cools off and lubricates the catheter system. The design of the Aspirex&#xD;
      catheter does not allow recirculation of aspirated blood. In static in-vitro tests using&#xD;
      human blood samples, aspiration with the Aspirex device was not associated with an increase&#xD;
      in plasma free hemoglobin (24). Catheter introduction and thrombectomy mandate the use of a&#xD;
      12-French sheath inserted into the internal jugular or femoral vein. A pigtail or&#xD;
      balloon-tipped catheter is required to place an exchange guide wire in the pulmonary artery.&#xD;
      The Aspirex device is then introduced over the wire. An 80-cm 12-French sheath instead of a&#xD;
      standard size 12-French sheath may be used to: 1) provide more support to introduce the&#xD;
      Aspirex device into the pulmonary arteries, 2) to monitor right ventricular or pulmonary&#xD;
      artery pressures, and 3) to inject contrast agent for pulmonary angiography. The distal part&#xD;
      of the catheter shaft has enhanced flexibility, facilitating right heart passage and&#xD;
      selective advancement into proximal pulmonary arteries (Table 1).&#xD;

      C. In vivo tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary embolization (24):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following general anesthesia, a median cervicotomy was performed to obtain access to jugular&#xD;
      vessels in 13 pigs (44.5 kg). A 24-French sheath was surgically inserted into the right&#xD;
      external jugular vein (24); 6-French sheaths were placed into the left external jugular vein,&#xD;
      left internal jugular vein, and right common carotid artery, respectively. Following&#xD;
      intravenous administration of 5000 units of unfractionated heparin, 5-French pigtail&#xD;
      catheters were advanced over a J-tipped 0.035-inch guide wire (Emerald, Cordis, Miami, FL)&#xD;
      into the ascending aorta and superior vena cava. Two porcine 4-day old thrombi, 5-6 cm in&#xD;
      length and 1-2 cm in diameter, were injected with 20 ml saline solution through the 24-French&#xD;
      sheath using a tapered adapter 24. The tapered adapter allowed intact injection of thrombi&#xD;
      through the sheath. A third thrombus was injected in 4 animals because the mean aortic&#xD;
      pressure remained &gt; 70 mm Hg or the mean pulmonary artery pressure remained &lt; 25 mm Hg after&#xD;
      injection of 2 thrombi. Total injected thrombus weight was 17.4 g. Of the 13 pigs, 3 died&#xD;
      immediately after thrombus injection due to cardiogenic shock. Ten pigs developed cardiogenic&#xD;
      shock but nevertheless survived; two required intravenous epinephrine (bolus of 1 mg) for&#xD;
      profound systemic arterial hypotension following thrombus injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter thrombectomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thrombectomy was initiated immediately after a drop in mean aortic pressure to less than 70&#xD;
      mm HG or an increase in mean pulmonary artery pressure to &gt; 25 mm Hg were achieved. Following&#xD;
      embolization, a 260-cm J-tipped exchange wire (Terumo, Leuven, Belgium) was advanced via the&#xD;
      24-French sheath into the distal right or left pulmonary artery, passing the proximal&#xD;
      occlusion site. The thrombectomy catheter was introduced over the exchange guide wire and&#xD;
      then advanced into a proximal occlusion site. The catheter device was gently withdrawn during&#xD;
      aspiration. Catheter embolectomy was performed in the main pulmonary artery, right and left&#xD;
      main and right and left lower lobe pulmonary arteries but not in upper lobe pulmonary&#xD;
      arteries or segmental branches. Thrombectomy was discontinued as soon as the mean aortic&#xD;
      pressure increased to &gt; 70 mmHg or the mean pulmonary artery pressure decreased to &lt; 25 mmHg,&#xD;
      regardless of the angiographic result. In one animal, the right but not left embolized lung&#xD;
      was left untreated to investigate macroscopic and microscopic changes due to embolization;&#xD;
      the left lung was treated with the Aspirex catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Necropsy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After en bloc resection of the heart and lungs, all cardiac structures were examined&#xD;
      macroscopically, including the right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricle, and pulmonic&#xD;
      valve, as well as the main pulmonary artery, right and left pulmonary artery for rupture,&#xD;
      perforation, dissection, or hemorrhage. Lung specimens were examined macroscopically for&#xD;
      hemorrhage, edema, or atelectasis. After partial fixation in 4% formaldehyde solution, lung&#xD;
      specimens were cut transversely into 1-cm sections and evaluated macroscopically for&#xD;
      perforation and dissection of treated and untreated pulmonary artery segments. After partial&#xD;
      fixation in 4% formaldehyde solution, lung specimens were cut transversally into 1-cm&#xD;
      sections and evaluated macroscopically for perforation and dissection of treated and&#xD;
      untreated pulmonary artery segments. After complete fixation, representative samples (8-10&#xD;
      per lung) were paraffin-embedded, cut into 3 micrometer sections, and stained with&#xD;
      hematoxylin-eosin and van Gieson combined with Weigert's method for elastic fiber staining&#xD;
      (Weigert-van Gieson) for histological evaluation of the vessel wall integrity. The&#xD;
      microscopic endpoints included perforation, dissection, or hemorrhage of treated vascular&#xD;
      segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. SPECIFIC AIMS AND HYPOTHESES&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will introduce a compassionate use protocol for treating 50 patients with massive PE by&#xD;
      percutaneous catheter thrombectomy at selected academic hospitals in Switzerland, Germany,&#xD;
      and the United States, using the Aspirex PE catheter thrombectomy device. We plan to enroll a&#xD;
      minimum of 10 but no more than 20 patients at the University Hospital of Zurich from October&#xD;

&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Thrombectomy with the Aspirex catheter device is associated with improved flow in the&#xD;
           treated main and lobar pulmonary arteries, as assessed by the angiographic Miller index.&#xD;

&#xD;
        3. Life expectancy due to underlying disease less than one month&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. SUBJECT ENROLLMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physicians caring for PE patients will be made aware of the compassionate use protocol with&#xD;
      an announcement at a staff meeting. Physicians will then have the option of informing the&#xD;
      investigators about potential candidates for the study. The enrollment of a patient in this&#xD;
      compassionate use protocol requires agreement from: 1) the responsible attending physician,&#xD;
      and 2) the interventional cardiologist on call, and the cardiovascular surgeon on call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the limited prognosis with massive PE, patients cannot provide informed consent to&#xD;
      participate in this compassionate use protocol. Initially, written informed consent will be&#xD;
      obtained from a physician not involved in the compassionate use protocol. Physician&#xD;
      investigators will obtain written informed consent in all patients after completion of the PE&#xD;
      catheter thrombectomy if the patient is consentable. The patient will be asked to participate&#xD;
      in study-related procedures, including the measurement of plasma free hemoglobin from blood&#xD;
      obtained during the procedure, echocardiography 24-72 hours after the procedure, and a&#xD;
      telephone interview 3-6 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. STUDY PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study-related procedures are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. measurement of plasma free hemoglobin after completion of the procedure in the&#xD;
           catheterization laboratory. Five ml blood will be withdrawn from an existing vascular&#xD;
           access site, without the need for additional venipuncture.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. echocardiography 24-72 hours after the procedure to assess recovery of right ventricular&#xD;
           function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. clinical follow-up by telephone interview 3-6 months after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Baseline hemodynamic measurements, pulmonary angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Type and cross 2 units of packed red blood cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Gain vascular access, preferably the right femoral vein using a standard 12-F sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Perform a manual injection with 5-10 ml of contrast to rule out iliac and inferior vena&#xD;
           cava thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. May exchange for an 80-cm 12-F sheath to: 1) provide more support to introduce the&#xD;
           Aspirex device into the pulmonary arteries, 2) to monitor right ventricular or pulmonary&#xD;
           artery pressures during thrombectomy, and 3) to inject contrast for pulmonary&#xD;
           angiography without removing the thrombectomy device from the pulmonary artery.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Alternatively, the contralateral femoral vein or jugular vein may be accessed to advance&#xD;
           a diagnostic catheter into the right ventricle or main pulmonary trunk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Obtain pressure tracings from right atrium, right ventricle, pulmonary artery, and&#xD;
           oxygen saturation from the right atrium and pulmonary artery. Obtain arterial oxygen&#xD;
           saturation if arterial sheath in place or document oxygen saturation by pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Perform pulmonary angiography using digital subtraction angiography (DSA). Cine&#xD;
           angiography should be used only if the patient is not intubated and cannot hold breath&#xD;
           for at least 5-8 seconds. The standard Grollman catheter, standard curved pigtail&#xD;
           catheter, or another angiographic catheter may be used to achieve the desired position&#xD;
           for pulmonary angiography. Perform a manual injection of 5-10 cc contrast with the&#xD;
           catheter tip in the pulmonary main trunk to localize emboli in the right or left main&#xD;
           pulmonary artery. Advance the catheter into the right or left pulmonary artery and&#xD;
           perform selective angiography in the frontal view using 20 cc of contrast per 2 seconds&#xD;
           via a power injector. Higher contrast volumes should not be used to avoid worsening of&#xD;
           right heart failure. The second standard view (45 degree ipsilateral posterior oblique&#xD;
           view) should be used only when biplane imaging is available. If both main pulmonary&#xD;
           arteries are to be treated, selective angiography should be performed for both lungs&#xD;
           separately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Aspirex PE catheter thrombectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Obtain the activated clotting time (ACT) and adjust the heparin dose to achieve an ACT&#xD;
           between 300 and 350 to avoid malfunction of the thrombectomy device. Bivalirudin&#xD;
           (Angiox) may be used if the patient has a history of heparin induced thrombocytopenia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Introduce a 0.035 inch, 260-cm exchange-length J-tipped Terumo wire into the&#xD;
           angiographic catheter and advance the wire into a distal lobar or proximal segmental&#xD;
           branch by crossing the occlusion site. Confirm wire position in the main and lobar&#xD;
           pulmonary arteries using a manual injection of 5-10 ml contrast. Remove the angiographic&#xD;
           catheter and introduce the Aspirex catheter device over the wire using a torquer to hold&#xD;
           the Terumo wire in place.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Advance the Aspirex device into the proximal occlusion site. During thrombectomy, the&#xD;
           Aspirex device should be gently advanced to the distal occlusion site and then pulled&#xD;
           back while continuing aspiration. During thrombectomy, rotate the Aspirex device gently&#xD;
           to allow for maximum contact of the L-shaped aspiration port with the thrombus. The&#xD;
           maximum time for one thrombectomy pass should not exceed 10 seconds to avoid vessel wall&#xD;
           engagement during aspiration and unnecessary blood loss. Do not advance the Aspirex&#xD;
           device into segmental arteries to avoid perforation or dissection. Thrombectomy should&#xD;
           be discontinued as soon as the systemic arterial pressure increases or the pulmonary&#xD;
           artery pressure decreases, regardless of the angiographic result. The Aspirex device&#xD;
           should not be used without the Terumo wire.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Several thrombectomy passes may be required to recanalize the main or lobar pulmonary&#xD;
           arteries and to improve hemodynamics. If both pulmonary arteries need to be treated,&#xD;
           exchange the Aspirex device for a pigtail, multipurpose catheter, or other angiographic&#xD;
           catheter to probe the contralateral pulmonary artery with the Terumo wire, and repeat&#xD;
           step 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      C) Post thrombectomy hemodynamic measurements and pulmonary angiography&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. After completion of thrombectomy, obtain pressure tracings from right atrium, right&#xD;
           ventricle, pulmonary artery, and oxygen saturation from the right atrium and pulmonary&#xD;
           artery. Obtain arterial oxygen saturation if arterial sheath in place or document oxygen&#xD;
           saturation by pulse oximetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Perform selective pulmonary angiography of the treated lungs in the frontal view using&#xD;
           20 cc of contrast per 2 seconds via a power injector. The second standard view (45&#xD;
           degree ipsilateral posterior oblique view) should be used only if biplane imaging is&#xD;
           available to avoid unnecessary volume overload.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If an inferior vena cava filter is to be inserted, this must be performed after&#xD;
           completion of thrombectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D) Post thrombectomy plasma free hemoglobin level&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtain a blood sample from the venous sheath for measurement of plasma free hemoglobin&#xD;
&#xD;
      E) Echocardiography 24 to72 hours post thrombectomy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography will be performed 24-72 hours after thrombectomy for evaluating right&#xD;
      ventricular function, right ventricular dilatation, tricuspid and pulmonic valve function,&#xD;
      and for ruling our pericardial effusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      F) Clinical follow-up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical follow-up will be performed by telephone interview 3-6 months after the procedure.&#xD;
      The aim is to determine symptoms and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. BIOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Sample size assumptions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation was based on a study of 20 patients with massive PE in which&#xD;
      percutaneous catheter intervention was associated with an immediate reduction in mean PAP&#xD;
      from 31,6 to 28,8 mm Hg (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimated sample size for one-sample comparison of mean to hypothesized value (STATA&#xD;
      Corporation):&#xD;
&#xD;
      alpha = 0.05 (two-sided) Power (beta) = 90% Baseline mean PAP (mm Hg) = 31 Baseline mean PAP&#xD;
      standard deviation = 6 Follow-up mean PAP (mm Hg) = 28 Estimated sample size n = 43&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) Data analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will perform repeated measures ANOVA tests to compare baseline with follow-up&#xD;
      measurements, with Bonferroni's adjustment for multiple comparisons. The following continuous&#xD;
      variables will be compared pre and post thrombectomy: mean PAP, PVR, cardiac output, cardiac&#xD;
      index, systolic arterial cuff pressure, angiographic Miller index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. RISKS AND DISCOMFORTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Major risks from pulmonary angiography and PE catheter thrombectomy include perforation and&#xD;
      dissection of cardiovascular structures and of treated or untreated pulmonary arteries, with&#xD;
      pericardial tamponade, hemothorax, and pulmonary hemorrhage as the most serious consequences.&#xD;
      The risk of these complications during diagnostic pulmonary angiography is less than 0.5% but&#xD;
      they may occur more frequently during pulmonary thrombectomy. Thrombectomy should only be&#xD;
      performed in the main and lobar and not in segmental pulmonary arteries to minimize the risk&#xD;
      of perforation or dissection. Thrombectomy should be terminated as soon as hemodynamic&#xD;
      improvement is achieved, regardless of the angiographic result. In addition, catheter&#xD;
      thrombectomy must be performed with surgical back-up, i.e., with immediate availability of a&#xD;
      cardiovascular surgical team and an operating room with cardiopulmonary bypass. In case of a&#xD;
      perforation, the interventional cardiologist will reverse or minimize anticoagulation, insert&#xD;
      a pericardial drain, or place a balloon catheter to cover the vascular perforation site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injection of contrast agent is required to localize obstructing pulmonary emboli and to&#xD;
      control the success of the thrombectomy procedure. There is risk of worsening right&#xD;
      ventricular failure with contrast injection in patients with massive pulmonary embolism. The&#xD;
      contrast injection volumes and rates must therefore be minimized in patients with&#xD;
      end-diastolic PAP &gt; 25 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other potential complications include arrhythmia, tricuspid or pulmonic regurgitation,&#xD;
      vascular access complications, including hematoma, pseudoaneurysm, or AV fistula, and&#xD;
      anaphylactic reaction to iodine contrast. Bleeding may occur at any site from anticoagulation&#xD;
      with intravenous unfractionated heparin. Renal failure may occur due to the use of iodine&#xD;
      contrast for pulmonary angiography, particularly in patients with preexisting renal&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One disadvantage of the Aspirex device is that blood is extracted during thrombectomy.&#xD;
      Prolonged aspiration may potentially cause hemodynamic deterioration in patients with&#xD;
      PE-related shock. In patients with a massive thrombus load, prolonged thrombectomy may be&#xD;
      required to reverse cardiogenic shock but may result in significant blood loss. In this&#xD;
      situation, transfusion of 1 or 2 units of packed red blood cells may be necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter thrombectomy may occasionally be ineffective to remove centrally located pulmonary&#xD;
      emboli and to reverse cardiogenic shock. Surgical embolectomy should then be considered for&#xD;
      failed catheter thrombectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sponsor of the study, Straub Medical AG, Wangs, Switzerland has contracted an insurance&#xD;
      to cover costs for device-related damage or death. Since the mortality from massive PE is&#xD;
      exceedingly high and patients may die despite a technically successful procedure, the&#xD;
      insurance will not cover events that are not related to device-related damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. POTENTIAL BENEFITS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Catheter thrombectomy to treat massive PE can rapidly reverse acute right ventricular failure&#xD;
      and cardiogenic shock and therefore is potentially life-saving. Catheter thrombectomy&#xD;
      represents the only reperfusion strategy when contraindications to thrombolysis are present&#xD;
      or when surgical embolectomy is not feasible or not readily available. In addition, catheter&#xD;
      thrombectomy is a minimally invasive interventional therapy without the need for&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass in the setting of the failing right ventricle. If no reperfusion&#xD;
      therapy, including thrombolysis, catheter thrombectomy, or surgical embolectomy in addition&#xD;
      to anticoagulation is initiated, the risk of death during hospitalization in patients with&#xD;
      massive PE exceeds 30% (7,10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard therapy with thrombolysis is associated with an increased risk of major hemorrhage,&#xD;
      and intracranial hemorrhage was reported in up to 3% of the patients with massive PE (1). In&#xD;
      comparison to thrombolysis, catheter thrombectomy causes fewer systemic bleeding&#xD;
      complications, including the most serious complication of intracranial hemorrhage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IX. MONITORING AND QUALITY ASSURANCE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Adverse Event Report Form (AERF) must be completed by the Site Investigator or a licensed&#xD;
      Physician Coinvestigator and faxed to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the Sponsor (Straub Medical AG), and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the local ethics committee within 24 hours after the occurrence of the event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sponsor will forward the AERF immediately to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the Principal Investigator,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SWISSMEDIC, and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the Data Safety Monitoring Officer (DSMO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      X. DATA SAFETY MONITORING OFFICER (DSMO)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prof. Stavros Konstandinides, University Hospital Göttingen, is a pulmonary embolism expert&#xD;
      who will serve as Data Safety Monitoring Officer (DSMO). The Sponsor is responsible for&#xD;
      reporting any adverse events to the DSMO as described above. In addition, safety endpoints&#xD;
      will be reviewed by the DSMO after each 10 enrolled patients. The DSMO can suggest to&#xD;
      terminate the study prematurely based on concerns about patient safety.&#xD;
