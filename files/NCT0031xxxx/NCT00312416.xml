  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Brimonidine tartrate is an alpha-2 agonist ocular hypotensive drug that exerts its effect by&#xD;
      causing both a decrease in aqueous production and an increase in uveoscleral outflow. It has&#xD;
      been proven to reduce increased intraocular pressure in glaucoma and ocular hypertension. As&#xD;
      an alpha 2 agonist Brimonidine belongs to the same class of drugs as Clonidine; however, its&#xD;
      molecular structure is sufficiently different to make it more selective for the alpha 2&#xD;
      receptor than Clonidine. Unlike Clonidine, Brimonidine does not appear to have an effect on&#xD;
      the central nervous system and therefore does not cause sedation or systemic hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition to their known effect of lowering intraocular pressure, alpha 2 adrenoceptor&#xD;
      agonists are neuroprotective. It has, however, been shown that Brimonidine is a very potent&#xD;
      vasoconstrictor in the ciliary body thus reducing aqueous humor production. Little is,&#xD;
      however, known about potential vasoconstrictor effects of Brimonidine in the posterior pole&#xD;
      of the eye. This is of clinical importance, because optic nerve head ischemia appears to&#xD;
      contribute to glaucoma pathophysiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is performed to investigate the effects of topical Clonidine vs. topical&#xD;
      Brimonidine on choroidal blood flow and intraocular pressure during isometric exercise.&#xD;
