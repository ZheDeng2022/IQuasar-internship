  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on success with telephone follow up for other groups of medically fragile infants, we&#xD;
      designed an innovative model of post-hospital comprehensive and coordinated follow-up for&#xD;
      infants with chronic lung disease. In this model, which we refer to as community-based&#xD;
      follow-up, medical management was coordinated by a nurse specialist, through frequent&#xD;
      telephone contacts with the infants' primary caregiver. This model of follow up care was&#xD;
      compared, in a randomized trial, with the more traditional model - multidisciplinary medical&#xD;
      center-based care. We hypothesized that community-based care would lead to health and&#xD;
      developmental outcomes similar to those observed with center-based care.&#xD;

      METHODS Study design A randomized equivalence trial was designed to compare community-based&#xD;
      follow up with medical-center based follow up. The primary outcome was assessed at one year&#xD;
      adjusted age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants Infants were recruited in five neonatal intensive care units in northwest&#xD;
      North CArolina. These were the only sites providing neonatal intensive care in a&#xD;
      twenty-county region in northwest North Carolina. Infants were born between March 1996 and&#xD;
      September 1999. Infants were eligible for the study if they were born before 33 weeks&#xD;
      gestational age, required supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks gestational age, and were&#xD;
      discharged home after neonatal intensive care. Neonates who had major congenital anomalies&#xD;
      and/ or had tracheostomy tubes were excluded. Also excluded were families in which the mother&#xD;
      did not speak English, because the intervention depended on verbal communication with the&#xD;
      nurse specialist, and families who lived more than 150 miles from our clinic because such&#xD;
      families typically are referred to regional neonatal center closer to their home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization A randomization list was prepared by a biostatistician who was not involved in&#xD;
      data collection or clinical care of the infants. Lists of randomization assignments, which&#xD;
      were kept in a sealed envelope in a locked drawer, were prepared for each of the five sites&#xD;
      at which participants were recruited. Randomization assignments were made in blocks sizes of&#xD;
      two and four. Once a study participant arrived home from the neonatal intensive care unit, a&#xD;
      research assistant uncovered the next assignment on the randomization list, which was kept in&#xD;
      a sealed envelope in a locked drawer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention If the family did not have telephone service at the time of the infant's&#xD;
      discharge, a telephone was installed at no cost to the family, within one week of the&#xD;
      infant's discharge from the hospital. Research funds were used to reimburse all families for&#xD;
      the cost of local phone service for the duration of the study. Families assigned to either&#xD;
      intervention could contact the nurse specialist on a toll-free long distance line with voice&#xD;
      mail which recorded messages when the phone was not attended.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention team consisted of two neonatologists, a pediatric social worker, and a nurse&#xD;
      specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Community-based follow up Telephone contacts were made to the infants' primary caregiver by&#xD;
      the nurse specialist twice weekly in the first month after discharge, weekly in months two&#xD;
      through four, and monthly thereafter until the infant attained 12 months adjusted age. At&#xD;
      each telephone contact, the nurse used a semi-structured format to inquire about the infant's&#xD;
      health, community resources utilized by the infant, and potential stressors and sources of&#xD;
      support for the family. She also inquired about the infant's medications and feedings. If she&#xD;
      judged the infant would benefit from a change in medical management, additional assessments&#xD;
      or a subspecialty referral, she discussed the proposed change with one of the two study&#xD;
      neonatologists. If there was agreement, the recommendation was communicated to the family and&#xD;
      the infant's primary care provider. The nurse specialist also coordinated care for the infant&#xD;
      by communicating with home health nurses, public health nurses, early intervention&#xD;
      specialists, physical therapists, and pediatric sub-specialists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical center-based follow up For infants who were discharged home on supplemental oxygen,&#xD;
      the nurse specialist made a home visit 1 to 2 weeks after discharge. During this visit, the&#xD;
      nurse specialist obtained interim medical history, performed physical assessment including&#xD;
      pulse oximetry and body weight, reviewed discharge instructions regarding medication dosage&#xD;
      and use of durable medical equipment, and answered caregiver's questions about the infant's&#xD;
      care. If the nurse specialist had concerns about the medical condition of the infant, she&#xD;
      made changes to the plan of care after consultation with the study neonatologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infants assigned to the center-based care group were seen in the regional, high-risk&#xD;
      infant multidisciplinary clinic at Wake Forest University School of Medicine. The first&#xD;
      clinic visit occurred approximately one month after their discharge. A multidisciplinary team&#xD;
      consisting of the social worker, the nurse specialist and the neonatologist obtained detailed&#xD;
      interim medical history (feeding, respiratory status, medication history, illnesses and&#xD;
      health-services utilization) and performed a complete physical examination. Family stressors&#xD;
      and resources were discussed. All infants were scheduled for visits at four, eight, and&#xD;
      twelve months adjusted age. In addition, infants who were using supplemental oxygen were seen&#xD;
      at an interval of 1-2 months until all of the following criteria were met: 1) their growth&#xD;
      rate was 15-30 grams/day, 2) they were no longer using supplemental oxygen or other&#xD;
      medications, and 3) they were no longer using a home apnea monitor. At each clinic visit, the&#xD;
      infant and parent or guardian were seen individually by the clinic social worker, the nurse&#xD;
      specialist for this project, and one of the two neonatologists who conferred as a group and&#xD;
      developed a plan of care. This plan was communicated to the family by the nurse specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Communication with primary care providers Within 24 hours after randomization, the principal&#xD;
      investigator called the infants' primary care providers to inform them about the study design&#xD;
      and that the parents have consented to participate in the study. In the case of infants&#xD;
      randomized to community-based care, the primary care provider was given the choice of making&#xD;
      the decisions about changes in medical care independently or jointly with the nurse&#xD;
      specialist. A copy of a protocol for management of infants with CLD, developed by the study&#xD;
      team was mailed to each primary care provider. After each clinic visit (for the center-based&#xD;
      group) the primary care provider received a letter describing findings, impressions, and&#xD;
      recommendations. Contacts with the primary care physicians of infants randomized to&#xD;
      community-based care occurred whenever the nurse specialist believed that a change in care&#xD;
      was indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes assessed during the first year Self-administered questionnaires were used to assess&#xD;
      psychosocial status of the family, healthcare utilization and healthcare expenses at&#xD;
      baseline, one, four, seven and eleven months. Each time the family completed study&#xD;
      questionnaires and when home visits were made, families were given twenty dollars as&#xD;
      compensation. At eleven months, a research assistant conducted a home visit and assessed the&#xD;
      home using the Caldwell HOME Inventory,27 and the parent-infant interaction using a scale&#xD;
      developed by Holditch and Miles.28 Only results of rehospitalization rates during the first&#xD;
      year will be presented in this paper.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes assessed at one year adjusted age All children were evaluated at one year adjusted&#xD;
      age at a Development Evaluation Clinic dedicated solely to developmental assessments of&#xD;
      high-risk infants. The primary outcome, the Bayley Scales of Infant Development-Second&#xD;
      Edition (BSID-2) Mental Developmental Index (MDI)I, and two secondary outcomes - the BSID&#xD;
      Pyschomotor Developmental Index (PDI) and the Vineland Adaptive Behavioral Scales (VABS) were&#xD;
      assessed by child psychologists or psychology graduate students supervised by a child&#xD;
      psychologist, who were not aware of the child's intervention group or medical history. After&#xD;
      the testing was completed, the psychologist was informed of the infant's gestational age at&#xD;
      birth, so that the BSID scores could be corrected for the degree of prematurity. The BSID MDI&#xD;
      is a widely used and validated developmental assessment tool to measure cognitive development&#xD;
      in the first two years of life. The BSID PDI measures fine and gross motor development.29 The&#xD;
      population mean for both the scores is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Higher score on&#xD;
      BSID MDI and PDI represents better cognitive and motor functioning respectively.30 When the&#xD;
      BSID MDI/ PDI score was less than 50, then the score was extrapolated as described&#xD;
      previously.31&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales are a parent-reported measure of child adaptive&#xD;
      development. The scale assesses four domains of adaptive development: communication, daily&#xD;
      living skills, socialization, and motor skills. The overall Adaptive Behavior Composite (ABC)&#xD;
      is a standard score based on the child's age, with higher scores representing better adaptive&#xD;
      functioning. Population mean for ABC is 100 and the standard deviation is 15.32&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements were performed by a neonatologist, who was aware of the infants'&#xD;
      intervention assignment, using a pediatric scale for weight, a length board for length, and a&#xD;
      tape measure for head circumference. Growth delay was defined as weight for length less than&#xD;
      5th percentile at one year adjusted age. At 1 year follow-up, a research assistant reviewed&#xD;
      each child's clinic chart and noted whether any of the following health conditions or receipt&#xD;
      of health-services: cerebral palsy, blindness, hearing impairment, seizure disorder, oxygen&#xD;
      requirement, need for tracheostomy tube and ventriculo-peritoneal shunt.&#xD;
