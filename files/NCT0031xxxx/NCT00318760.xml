  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Research has shown that clonidine, a drug originally prescribed to treat high blood&#xD;
      pressure and some symptoms of opioid withdrawal, can help block stress-induced relapse to&#xD;
      heroin and cocaine seeking in rats. However, it does not seem to block cue-induced relapse in&#xD;
      rats. Researchers are interested in studying whether clonidine shows the same pattern of&#xD;
      effects on stress- and cue-induced cravings for heroin or cocaine in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - To compare the ability of clonidine to reduce stress- and cue-induced cocaine and heroin&#xD;
      craving in drug abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Individuals between 18 and 55 years of age who are current cocaine or heroin users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study will consist of two visits: a screening visit to determine eligibility and an&#xD;
           experimental/script session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Before the script session, participants will provide urine and breath samples for&#xD;
           testing. Participants will complete questionnaires to measure their current drug craving&#xD;
           and days since last use of cocaine or heroin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At the start of the script session, participants will receive a dose of clonidine or&#xD;
           placebo as directed by the study researchers. Three hours after dosing, participants&#xD;
           will be read four scripts (two neutral, one stress-inducing, and one drug-cue-related)&#xD;
           with breaks in between each script. After each script, participants will respond to&#xD;
           questions about levels of stress and craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will provide saliva samples immediately before and during the script&#xD;
           readings, and will also be measured for skin response to the scripts.&#xD;

      Background. Stress and exposure to drug-related cues (environmental stimuli previously&#xD;
      associated with drug availability) are considered factors that increase the risk of relapse&#xD;
      to heroin and/or cocaine use. The two factors may act through different neural mechanisms.&#xD;
      Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists, such as clonidine, have been shown to block stress-induced&#xD;
      relapse, but not cue-induced relapse, to heroin and cocaine self-administration in rodents.&#xD;
      The ability of clonidine to attenuate stress- or cue-induced heroin and cocaine craving in&#xD;
      drug abusers has not been tested. It is important to determine, in humans, whether clonidine&#xD;
      blocks the acute effects of only one putative class of relapse precipitants, or whether its&#xD;
      effects are more general.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scientific goal. To compare the ability of clonidine to reduce stress-induced and cue-induced&#xD;
      cocaine and heroin craving in drug abusers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant population. A total of up to 160 drug abusers using cocaine, heroin, or both will&#xD;
      be enrolled. Target enrollment will include 40% women and 60% minorities (mostly&#xD;
      African-American).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental design and methods. Participants will be randomized to one of three groups&#xD;
      receiving clonidine 0.1 mg, clonidine 0.2 mg, or placebo orally under double-blind&#xD;
      conditions. The study will consist of a single 5-6 hr experimental session in which there&#xD;
      will be baseline measures, drug administration, and four script-guided imagery sets, each&#xD;
      followed by a period of data collection. Three hours after dosing (when peak plasma clonidine&#xD;
      concentrations are reached), participants will be exposed to four scripts: one&#xD;
      stress-inducing, one describing drug cues, and two with neutral content. The standardized&#xD;
      script-guided imagery procedure has previously been shown to reliably induce negative&#xD;
      affective states (stress scripts) and/or craving (stress and drug-cue scripts) compared to&#xD;
      the neutral scripts and to have internal and external validity (Tiffany and Drobes, 1990;&#xD;
      Maude-Griffin and Tiffany, 1996; Taylor et al., 2000; Sinha et al., 1999, 2000, 2003;&#xD;
      Singleton et al., 2003; Tiffany and Haekeneworth, 1991; Elash et al., 1995; Drobes and&#xD;
      Tiffany, 1997; Taylor et al., 2000; Singleton et al., 2003). Outcome measures will include&#xD;
      subjective ratings of drug craving and mood, autonomic response (galvanic skin response&#xD;
      [GSR]), and endocrine responses (salivary cortisol and salivary ?-amylase, a measure of&#xD;
      endogenous adrenergic activity during stress (Chatterton et al., 1996; Nater et al., 2005;&#xD;
      van Stegeren et al., 2005)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benefits to participants and/or society. There are no direct benefits to participants.&#xD;
      However, if clonidine is effective in blocking stress-induced and/or cue-induced craving,&#xD;
      then the results will be used as a basis for designing a treatment trial, and drug abusers&#xD;
      and society may benefit from the eventual use of clonidine or other alpha agonists for&#xD;
      prevention of relapse in cocaine and heroin users. In addition, this research will provide&#xD;
      information on the clinical relevance of a preclinical model of relapse, possibly&#xD;
      strengthening arguments for its use in medication development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risks to participants. Participants may experience side effects from clonidine such as&#xD;
      sedation and are expected to experience brief, mild psychological stress and drug craving&#xD;
      from the laboratory script procedures. Prior to leaving the session, participants will be&#xD;
      assessed for the presence of continued drug effects. If participants are experiencing any&#xD;
      stress or craving at the end of the session, they will undergo a 10-minute guided relaxation&#xD;
      session, which will be repeated until feelings of stress or craving dissipate, before being&#xD;
      released from the laboratory. Participants may be kept longer than the planned session&#xD;
      length, up to and including staying overnight on the inpatient ward, because of continued&#xD;
      side effects or elevated stress or craving. If the MRP deems it medically necessary,&#xD;
      participants will be sent to JHBMC emergency department for further evaluation and treatment.&#xD;
