    <textblock>
      This research study is for patients that have been diagnosed with chronic uveitis, a disease&#xD;
      that causes inflammation in the eye. Patients are currently being treated with Remicade,&#xD;
      Humira, Methotrexate and or similar chemotherapy type drugs to control this inflammation.&#xD;
      Despite these medications, patients still have inflammation in their eyes. Patients are being&#xD;
      asked to add an additional drug, thalidomide.&#xD;

      Patients will be in the study for approximately 24 weeks. The visits are at screening,&#xD;
      baseline (week 0), and weeks 4,8,12, and 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this research study is to see if Thalidomide is safe and effective in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with chronic inflammation in their eyes. Thalidomide is approved by the&#xD;
      Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for a leprosy skin condition, erythema nodosum leprosum&#xD;
      (ENL). The drug works in many different ways, including as an anti-inflammation drug.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is thought that this drug might be able to improve symptoms and lung function.&#xD;
      At this time, the drug is not approved for use for uveitis.&#xD;
