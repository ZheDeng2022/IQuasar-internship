      Study Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many treatable causes of erythropoietin resistance (also known as erythropoietin&#xD;
      hypo-responsiveness) exist in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 3 to 5 . Well&#xD;
      recognized causes of erythropoietin resistance include iron deficiency, severe&#xD;
      hyperparathyroidism, chronic infection, vitamin deficiency, aluminum toxicity and poor&#xD;
      dialysis adequacy. Furthermore, many diseases resulting in the chronic inflammatory state&#xD;
      have also been associated with erythropoietin resistance in Non-CKD patients with diseases&#xD;
      such as chronic congestive heart failure, chronic liver disease and many connective tissue&#xD;
      diseases including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is now well recognized that CKD stage 5 patients receiving dialysis may also be at risk of&#xD;
      developing chronic inflammation resulting in a more severe syndrome characterized by&#xD;
      malnutrition and resistance to exogenous erythropoietin replacement therapy. Markers of a&#xD;
      chronic inflammatory state that are observed in dialysis patients include hypoalbuminemia,&#xD;
      elevated C-reactive protein (CRP), elevated ferritin, increased serum amyloid A and low&#xD;
      transferrin saturation. In addition, pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6),&#xD;
      tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1 (IL-1) have been shown in vivo to&#xD;
      suppress erythroid colony forming units. Erythrocyte lifespan can also be shortened through&#xD;
      increased clearance by macrophages that are activated by inflammatory signals and&#xD;
      immunoglobulin coated erythrocytes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inflammation also affects iron metabolism at many levels. Inflammatory cytokines can lead to&#xD;
      reduced serum concentrations of iron and transferrin. Reduction in transferrin then leads to&#xD;
      decreased iron absorption via the gut. Lactoferrin in polymorphonuclear cells can act as an&#xD;
      iron scavenger with bactericidal activity. Lactoferrin levels have been shown to increase in&#xD;
      inflammation and can bind large amounts of free iron, thereby reducing overall availability.&#xD;
      Functional iron deficiency, which is also a characteristic the inflammatory state associated&#xD;
      with erythropoietin resistance is defined as low availability of iron for erythropoiesis&#xD;
      despite normal or high iron stores. Functional iron deficiency can occur in two ways; when&#xD;
      high doses of exogenous erythropoietin stimulate erythropoiesis and it exceeds the capacity&#xD;
      to deliver adequate iron or alternatively, when delivery of iron from the reticuloendothelial&#xD;
      system to hematopoietic cells is blocked. Both mechanisms may occur in patients with chronic&#xD;
      inflammation and erythropoietin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Erythropoietin resistance has been defined in several ways. In studies that analyzed Eprex®&#xD;
      use, authors have utilized a dose cut off point of &gt;200units of Eprex®/kg/week as a&#xD;
      reasonable marker of 'true' erythropoietin resistance, or erythropoietin resistance occurring&#xD;
      with no obvious cause contributing to a poor Eprex® response. Other authors have used the&#xD;
      dose cut point of &gt;300units /kg/week to define erythropoietin resistance. Furthermore, a&#xD;
      measure of erythropoietin resistance called the Eprex® dose to hematocrit ratio (Eprex®/Hct)&#xD;
      has been used as a continuous variable in some studies and has been shown to be positively&#xD;
      correlated with certain markers of erythropoietin resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of erythropoietin resistance in dialysis patients have been studied. Previous studies&#xD;
      have shown that CRP levels greater than 20mg/L are associated with Eprex® resistance in&#xD;
      dialysis patients. Other markers include low albumin, high fibrinogen, low transferrin and&#xD;
      high ferritin. Other novel markers of inflammation such as plasma&#xD;
      N-acetyl-seryl-aspartyl-lysyl-proline, procalcitonin, fetuin and neopterin have also been&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The true prevalence of Eprex® resistance is not known in Canada. It is estimated to be&#xD;
      approximately 10% based on the early Eprex® therapy trials. The Canadian Nephrology Practice&#xD;
      Patterns Study (CNPPS), which collected data on a large subset of Canadian dialysis patients&#xD;
      from 1995 to 1998 provides some further estimates. Several authors have analyzed the CNPPS&#xD;
      data and applied Eprex® resistance measures to this study population. Using the dose cut off&#xD;
      point of &gt;200units/kg/week of Eprex®, the authors found that the prevalence of Eprex®&#xD;
      resistance was 15.7% for hemodialysis (HD) patients and 5.5% for peritoneal dialysis (PD)&#xD;
      patients. Further analysis using the Eprex®/Hct measure showed a significant negative&#xD;
      correlation between Eprex®/Hct and serum albumin in both HD and PD patients. Body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) was also positively correlated with Eprex®/Hct in both groups. This study also found&#xD;
      that when the dose cut off of &gt;200units/kg/week was utilized as a measure of exogenous&#xD;
      erythropoietin resistance, 15% of the HD patients above this cut off point were utilizing 34%&#xD;
      of all the Eprex® administered to HD patients in the study period. Similarly, 5.5% of Eprex®&#xD;
      resistant PD patients required 16.2% of all the Eprex® given to PD patients during the same&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Little is known about the optimal way to manage 'true' erythropoietin resistance or&#xD;
      erythropoietin hypo-responsiveness. Traditionally, nephrologists have overcome erythropoietin&#xD;
      resistance by prescribing large or escalating Eprex® doses over prolonged periods of time.&#xD;
      There is minimal data that suggests the optimal way to manage these patients. There are no&#xD;
      published protocols that have studied systematic increases or decreases in Eprex® in such&#xD;
      patients. Furthermore, there are few studies on the safety of the use of high dose Eprex®&#xD;
      over prolonged periods of time. It is not known whether a dose ceiling beyond which Eprex® is&#xD;
      no longer pharmacologically effective exists in patients with 'true' Eprex® resistance.&#xD;
      Studies into the cost effectiveness of high dose Eprex® therapy in Eprex® resistant patients&#xD;
      are limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Eprex® resistance may be able to maintain their hemoglobin levels on reduced&#xD;
      dose Eprex®, but evidence for the efficacy and safety of an Eprex® dose reduction protocol is&#xD;
      limited to small open-label studies. In contradistinction, perhaps escalating Eprex® doses to&#xD;
      a maximum dose well above the recommended clinical practice guideline target is what is&#xD;
      required to improve hemoglobin levels in these patients.&#xD;
