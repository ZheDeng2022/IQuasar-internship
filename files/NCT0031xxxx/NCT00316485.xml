  <brief_summary>

      Under this study, patients who require removal of their third molars (wisdom teeth) will be&#xD;
      diagnosed, evaluated and treated. In addition, tooth, bone and gum tissue samples will be&#xD;
      collected for use in bone, wound healing, microbiology and genetic research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients 16-50 years of age who require wisdom tooth removal may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Participants may have one or all of their wisdom teeth removed at one time. The surgery is&#xD;
      done under local anesthetic. In addition, conscious sedation may be administered, if the&#xD;
      patient wishes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides wisdom tooth removal, patients are asked to donate a small sample of jaw bone (from&#xD;
      the lining of the inner wall of the tooth socket) and gum tissue (from the area of the&#xD;
      surgical site). The samples are collected at the same time as the tooth extraction. The bone&#xD;
      sample is about the size of a pencil point (1.5 millimeters wide and 3 millimeters long) and&#xD;
      the gum tissue sample is 1 millimeter. Removal of these samples should not cause any&#xD;
      additional discomfort or increase the time required for the surgery or for healing.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this protocol is to obtain oral tissue for analysis by various research&#xD;
      groups at the National Institutes of Health (NIH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol will enroll a convenience sample of 1,000 subjects between the ages of 18 to 50&#xD;
      years who are in need of third molar (wisdom tooth) extraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will report to the National Institutes of Dental and Craniofacial Research (NIDCR)&#xD;
      for up to three visits. The first study visit will involve a screening evaluation to&#xD;
      determine protocol eligibility. Eligible subjects will be invited back for a second visit for&#xD;
      wisdom tooth extraction and collection of oral tissue for research purposes. All subjects&#xD;
      will remain on the protocol for three weeks after surgery, and they will have the option to&#xD;
      schedule a follow-up visit to the NIH for post-operative evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not involve any outcome measurements.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        &lt;TAB&gt;&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Males and females aged 18 to 50 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Evidence of need for third molar extraction as determined by medical and dental&#xD;
             history, as well as clinical and radiographic evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing to provide at least one wisdom tooth for research purposes&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Willing to provide one or more of the following tissue types for research purposes:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Excessive gingival tissue around extraction sockets&#xD;
&#xD;
             Oral tissues from the floor of the mouth, cheek, palate and/or lateral border of the&#xD;
             tongue&#xD;
&#xD;
             Small biopsies of alveolar bone from the sockets that surround the wisdom teeth&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. America Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) status I or II&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Pregnant or nursing&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Clinical signs of infection and/or inflammation, or acute pain at any extraction site&#xD;
             at the time of the screening evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Known bleeding disorders or conditions associated with bleeding, including Hemophilia,&#xD;
             von Willebrand disease, protein C/S deficiency, antithrombin III deficiency, and liver&#xD;
             disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Currently using anticoagulation (blood thinning) medications, including but not&#xD;
             limited to warfarin (Coumadin), ticlopidine (Ticlid) and clopidogril (Plavix).&#xD;
             Subjects who are currently taking Aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs&#xD;
             (NSAIDs) may be eligible for enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known or suspected allergy or adverse reaction to any of the agents used for local&#xD;
             anesthesia, suture material, or conscious sedation medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Surgical removal of the wisdom teeth is expected to be unusually difficult based on&#xD;
             panoramic radiograph. Indicators of unusual difficulty include increased depth of&#xD;
             tooth impaction, extreme angulation of a tooth, and close proximity of a tooth to the&#xD;
             inferior alveolar nerve canal and/or maxillary sinus.&#xD;
