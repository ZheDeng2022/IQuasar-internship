      This study is designed for the collection of stem cells from the bloodstream for use in&#xD;
      research studies. These cells will be studied to determine if they have unique features&#xD;
      particular to the donor that may or may not affect their use for developing new treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Volunteers with or without a blood disease may be eligible to donate stem cells for this&#xD;
      study. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding may not enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors are evaluated with a medical history and physical examination, blood tests and an&#xD;
      ultrasound examination of the spleen. They then undergo stem cell mobilization and apheresis&#xD;
      as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors are given injections of a hormone called G-CSF every day for 5 days to stimulate&#xD;
      release of stem cells from the bone marrow into the bloodstream for collection. On the day of&#xD;
      the last injection, donors undergo apheresis to obtain white cells and stem cells. For this&#xD;
      procedure, blood is withdrawn through a catheter (plastic tube) placed in a vein and directed&#xD;
      into a machine where the white cells and stem cells are separated from the rest of the blood&#xD;
      by a spinning process. These cells are extracted and collected in a bag inside the machine,&#xD;
      and the rest of the blood is returned to the donor through a second catheter in a vein in the&#xD;
      other arm. The procedure takes 4 to 5 hours.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent advances in the area of stem cell research suggest that redirected differentiation of&#xD;
      stem cells may prove useful for the treatment of a variety of diseases including diabetes and&#xD;
      other systemic diseases. In the hematopoietic system, recent studies have also demonstrated&#xD;
      the ability of adult erythroid stem cells to undergo differentiation toward a fetal-like&#xD;
      phenotype. This fetal-like phenotype is crucial in eliminating the clinical sequelae of&#xD;
      sickle syndromes and beta hemoglobinopathies. However, additional studies are needed to&#xD;
      determine if these results can be applied to patients with diseases involving hematopoietic&#xD;
      stem cells or other blood cells. In addition, it is clear that the stem cells from separate&#xD;
      donors do not possess identical properties of growth and differentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immediate aim of this protocol is to obtain hematopoietic stem cells from many human&#xD;
      donors for examination of the biological properties of those cells. The study is also&#xD;
      designed to determine if the donor-specific factors can influence the properties of their&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cells. Each volunteer will undergo stem cell mobilization after&#xD;
      administration of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) for five consecutive days&#xD;
      followed by a large volume apheresis on the 5th day after G-CSF injection. The harvested&#xD;
      product will be purified for the primitive hematopoietic progenitor cells and viably&#xD;
      preserved in multiple aliquots. The cells will then be studied in-depth for a better&#xD;
      understanding of their biological properties, growth and differentiation. Donor-specific&#xD;
      information will be correlated with these research studies to identify factors that may&#xD;
      assist with the understanding of adult stem cell biology.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ability to give informed consent to participate in the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Meets NIH Department of Transfusion Medicine (DTM) eligibility criteria for blood component&#xD;
        donation for in vitro research use (including minimum HCT of 28%, platelet count greater&#xD;
        than 50,000/uL). Negative serologic tests for syphilis, hepatitis B and C, HIV, and HTLV-1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Listed below are acceptable medical conditions for inclusion in this protocol. They are&#xD;
        derived from donor criteria that pertain to stem cell mobilization and peripheral blood&#xD;
        leukapheresis described by the National Marrow Donor Program. Medical conditions that limit&#xD;
        bone marrow harvest or re-infusion of cells into stem cell recipients do not apply to this&#xD;
        protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Age: Volunteers of adult age including those over 60 years old who have no significant&#xD;
        cardiovascular disease will be allowed to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Allergies: If volunteers suffer from common allergies to animals, the environment, or&#xD;
        medications other than G-CSF, they will be allowed to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Arthritis: In general, if volunteers have mild to moderate osteoarthritis or degenerative&#xD;
        arthritis, they will be allowed to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cancer: If volunteers have a history of cancer or currently have cancer that does not&#xD;
        affect their cardiovascular status, they will be allowed to enroll.&#xD;

        well-controlled, they will be allowed to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Diabetes: If volunteers have diabetes, a careful evaluation of their current health status&#xD;
        will be necessary. In general, if their diabetes is well-controlled by either diet or oral&#xD;
        medications, and have no significant cardiovascular disease, they will be allowed to&#xD;
        enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA&#xD;

        the past year, they will be allowed to enroll.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Active infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Pregnant and lactating women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Splenomegaly: Patients having splenic diameters greater than 13.0 cm at the time of initial&#xD;
