      RATIONALE: Diagnostic procedures, such as positron emission tomography and computed&#xD;
      tomography scan (done before and after cellular adoptive immunotherapy), may help doctors&#xD;
      predict a patient's response to treatment and help plan the best treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well positron emission tomography and computed&#xD;
      tomography scan predicts response in patients with metastatic melanoma or kidney cancer who&#xD;
      are undergoing cellular adoptive immunotherapy on a Surgery Branch clinical trial.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure changes in metabolic activity at visceral sites during the acute treatment phase&#xD;
           of adoptive cell transfer (ACT) using positron emission tomography (PET)/CT fusion&#xD;
           imaging in patients with metastatic melanoma or renal cell cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure changes in metabolic activity at metastatic sites during the acute treatment&#xD;
           phase of ACT using PET/CT fusion imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the changes in metabolic activity at visceral and metastatic sites in patients&#xD;
           treated with intravenous vs intra-arterial tumor-infiltrating lymphocyte infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate response of individual metastases with these metabolic alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a pilot study. Patients are stratified according to treatment (intravenous&#xD;
      [IV] tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes [TIL] after a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen vs&#xD;
      intra-arterial [IA] TIL after a nonmyeloablative preparative regimen vs IV TIL after a&#xD;
      myeloablative preparative regimen with chemotherapy and total-body irradiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo positron emission tomography with fludeoxyglucose F 18 (FDG-PET)/CT fusion&#xD;
      imaging at baseline (before starting TIL infusion), once between days 1-4 after TIL infusion,&#xD;
      and once between days 5-8 after TIL infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 70 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
