    <textblock>
      Stubbing of the finger-tip is a common injury in sports such as basketball, volleyball,&#xD;
      cricket and football. This can result in a Mallet finger deformity, where the end joint of a&#xD;
      finger cannot be actively straightened out. In most mallet finger cases seen at The Alfred,&#xD;
      the skin remains intact, and the impairment results from a tear of the extensor tendon or an&#xD;
      avulsion (a small fracture where the tendon attaches to the bone). Treatment commonly&#xD;
      involves immobilising the end joint of the finger in a splint for six or more weeks so&#xD;
      patient compliance is a major factor in the quality of the outcome achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to compare two different types of splintage (the commonly used thermoplastic&#xD;
      thimble splint and the aluminium-foam &quot;Mexican hat&quot; splint which is in use in Britain) with a&#xD;
      control splint (thermoplastic prefabricated &quot;stack splint&quot; with tape). Outcome measures will&#xD;
      include patient compliance with the splint, degree of extensor lag, active movement of the&#xD;
      joint, and any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The null hypothesis is that there are no differences in outcome between different methods of&#xD;
      conservative splinting treatment for mallet finger.&#xD;

      1. Literature Review:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mallet finger is defined as a loss of continuity of the distal insertion of the extensor&#xD;
           tendon at the finger tip. It is a common hand injury in ball sports (McCue and Garroway&#xD;
           1985) but can also occur from minor incidents such as bed-making and trips/falls (Abouna&#xD;
           and Brown, 1968). The injury results in a drooping of the distal inter-phalangeal joint,&#xD;
           and is usually managed conservatively by splinting in hyper-extension for 6 or more&#xD;
           weeks. This position allows relaxation of the tendon and encourages healing by bringing&#xD;
           the torn ends or fracture fragments closer together during the healing phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A recent Cochrane Systematic review of the evidence in treating this injury (Handoll and&#xD;
           Vaghela, 2005) found that there is insufficient evidence in existing randomised&#xD;
           controlled trials to establish the effectiveness of different (either custom-made or&#xD;
           off-the-shelf) finger splints for treating mallet finger injury. They commented that&#xD;
           there were only 4 trials that met the inclusion criteria, and all of these were &quot;small,&#xD;
           heterogeneous, inadequately described and reportedâ€¦.and had methodological flaws&quot;.&#xD;
           Evidence provided is therefore an inadequate base for clinical decision making.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Rationale for project:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If mallet injuries are not managed correctly, the patient can be left with a persistent&#xD;
           extension lag (loss of voluntary straightening) and swan neck deformity (severe flexion&#xD;
           deformity of distal finger joint plus a secondary hyperextension deformity of the&#xD;
           proximal joint resulting from an imbalance in the extensor mechanism).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Mallet injuries are relatively common, with an estimated 100 cases treated at the Alfred&#xD;
           last year, and there is some debate about the best approach for their management. The&#xD;
           plastic surgery unit is keen to determine the optimal treatment for these injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The Cochrane systematic review (Handoll and Vaghela, 2005) found that there were only&#xD;
           four relevant trials that met inclusion criteria, and all of these had methodological&#xD;
           flaws. As this is a commonly presenting injury at The Alfred, an opportunity exists to&#xD;
           add to the evidence base by conducting a well-designed and thorough trial comparing the&#xD;
           two most commonly advocated treatments with a suitable control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Hypothesis/research questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Null Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           There are no differences in outcome between different methods of conservative splinting&#xD;
           treatment for mallet finger.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
           To determine the most appropriate conservative treatment for mallet finger injuries.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We aim to conduct a randomised controlled trial of over 100 participants, based on&#xD;
           current referrals to hand therapy. Subjects will be allocated to one of the following&#xD;
           groups using a randomised computer sequence:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Circumferential thermoplastic thimble splint, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  dorsally applied aluminium-foam &quot;Mexican hat&quot; splint, or&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  control splint (off-the-shelf thermoplastic &quot;stack&quot; splint with tape). NB it was&#xD;
                considered unethical to provide a &quot;no treatment&quot; control given the amount of&#xD;
                extension loss expected in an untreated injury and the likelihood of persistent&#xD;
                finger deformity.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All other aspects of treatment including frequency of contact, duration of initial&#xD;
           period of splintage, and patient advice (eg hygiene routine, exercise, splint&#xD;
           donning/doffing) will remain the same across all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Baseline data:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  gender&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  hand dominance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time since injury&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  type of injury (bony versus soft-tissue)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  degree of extensor lag (measured with a standardised goniometer)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  presence of other hand injuries on injured hand&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  smoker/non-smoker&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  medication&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  hand dominance&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  occupation or hobbies&#xD;
&#xD;
           Progressive measurements (to be taken at 6, 8, 10, 12, and 20 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  degree of extensor lag (measured with a standardised goniometer)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  development of complications, and whether a change in splint type was required&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patient adherence to treatment protocol, based on self-report. Patients will be&#xD;
                provided with a simple diary to complete which records incidences of removal or&#xD;
                adjustment of splint, the reason(s) for this (eg skin breakdown, poor splint fit,&#xD;
                dislodged during activity), and time out of splint&#xD;
&#xD;
           Outcome measures (to be taken at 10, 12 and 20 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  degree of extensor lag at the DIP&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  active range of motion at DIP&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  patient satisfaction with result on 5-point likert scale&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  pain, measured by 10 point Visual Analogue Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blinding of assessors:&#xD;
&#xD;
           - all progressive and outcome measurements will be taken by a separate assessor (not one&#xD;
           of the current treating hand therapists) trained in taking the measurements who has been&#xD;
           blinded to the type of splint used. To ensure this, splints will be removed prior to the&#xD;
           assessment and re-applied afterwards by the Allied Health Assistant using a standard&#xD;
           donning/doffing technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Inclusion/exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
           All referrals of patients with mallet finger injuries will be considered for inclusion&#xD;
           with the exception of the following exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  open injuries (where skin has been breached)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  mallet injury to thumb&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  co-existing rheumatologic illness&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  time from injury to presentation greater than 2 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Randomisation procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participants will be randomised to either of the 3 groups using a computer-generated&#xD;
           randomised sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical or other analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are aiming for 100 subjects, but if referrals are low, we have calculated statistical&#xD;
      power for a total of 75 subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - With 25 subjects per group this study will have an 80% power to detect a difference in&#xD;
      continuous variables equivalent to 80% of a standard deviation with a 2-sided p-value of&#xD;
      0.05. Based on the assumption of normality, a reduction of one standard deviation would be&#xD;
      equivalent to about 24%, therefore a reduction of .8 of a standard deviation would be&#xD;
      approximately equivalent to a 20% reduction. A difference of this size is perceived to be of&#xD;
      clinical importance. Repeat measures analysis will further increase the power of this study&#xD;
      although until between measures variability can be assessed, it is unsure by how much.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analysed using SAS version 8.2 (SAS Institute Cary, NC, USA). Data will be&#xD;
      assessed for normality and log-transformed where appropriate. Univariate analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted using chi-square test for equal proportion, analysis of variance and non-parametric&#xD;
      Kruskal wallis tests where required. Multivariate analysis will be performed using&#xD;
      generalised linear modelling adjusting for potential covariates and repeat measures. A two&#xD;
      sided p-value of 0.05 will be considered to be statistically significant.&#xD;
