  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We propose to build on preliminary data evaluating non-dopaminergic/non-motor clinical&#xD;
      biomarkers to more fully assess these markers at the threshold of Parkinson disease (PD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of reliable biomarkers for both dopaminergic and non-dopaminergic manifestations&#xD;
      of Parkinson disease (PD) and related disorders may dramatically accelerate research on PD&#xD;
      etiology, pathophysiology, and therapeutics. Biomarkers are broadly defined as&#xD;
      characteristics that are objectively measured and evaluated as indicators of normal&#xD;
      biological processes, pathogenic processes, or pharmacologic responses to a therapeutic&#xD;
      intervention. Specific biomarkers may be useful at the onset of neurodegeneration, the onset&#xD;
      of disease, and/or to mark disease progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two hundred patients who have undergone neurological evaluation by their general community&#xD;
      neurologist and have a questionable diagnosis of PD will be recruited to participate in this&#xD;
      study. Subjects will be referred by the neurologists to the Institute for Neurodegenerative&#xD;
      Disorders (IND) in New Haven, CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be clinically evaluated at IND by a two movement disorders experts. At the&#xD;
      baseline visit all subjects will also undergo [123I]ß-CIT SPECT ANAM, voice acoustics,&#xD;
      olfactory, Spiral and biochemical testing. Each movement disorders expert will make an&#xD;
      initial clinical diagnosis at baseline and again within three months follow-up. At the three&#xD;
      month visit one movement disorder expert will be provided the DAT imaging data and will&#xD;
      review that data with the subjects and referral physician. The other movement disorders&#xD;
      physician will remain blind to the imaging and all other biomarker data. The blinded movement&#xD;
      disorders expert will provide a final clinical diagnosis at the 12 month follow-up visit,&#xD;
      which will represent the 'gold standard' diagnosis in this study. Statistical analysis to&#xD;
      determine the sensitivity and specificity of ANAM, voice acoustics, olfactory, Spiral and&#xD;
      biochemical testing compared to [123I]ß-CIT SPECT, and the gold standard clinical diagnosis&#xD;
      will be completed. All subjects with DAT deficit and 10% of those without DAT deficit will be&#xD;
      asked to return for repeat evaluation at 24 months.&#xD;

    <description>Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography&#xD;
SPECT imaging uses the single photon emissions from radioactive compounds that are (most commonly) injected into a patient and are metabolized by specific organs or body systems. SPECT imaging is performed by using a gamma camera to acquire multiple 2-D images (also called projections), from multiple angles. A computer is then used to apply a tomographic reconstruction algorithm to the multiple projections, yielding a 3-D dataset. This dataset may then be manipulated to show thin slices along any chosen axis of the body, similar to those obtained from other tomographic techniques, such as MRI, CT, and PET. The resulting SPECT images reflect body/organ function as opposed to specific anatomy of other imaging modalities such as CT or MRI.</description>
