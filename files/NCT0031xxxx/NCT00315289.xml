      The purpose of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To report the success proportions of simple probing within different age groups of&#xD;
           patients under 24 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain descriptive data regarding symptoms and quality of life in patients receiving&#xD;
           simple probing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To obtain similar data for simple probing in patients 24 months of age or older, for&#xD;
           intubation in patients age 6 - &lt;48 months, and for balloon catheter dilation in patients&#xD;
           age 6 - &lt;48 months.&#xD;

      Nasolacrimal duct obstruction (NLDO) is a common ocular condition in the first year of life.&#xD;
      Most cases will resolve spontaneously or with massage. Many studies of primary treatment of&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct obstruction have been reported. These case series have largely been&#xD;
      retrospective, uncontrolled, and conducted in single centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple probing is the most widely-used initial treatment for NLDO in infancy. Two differing&#xD;
      approaches to simple probing have been most often been used, immediate office probing (early&#xD;
      probing-generally after 6 months of age), and medical management (episodic antibiotic drops&#xD;
      with massage of the lacrimal sac) until 9-13 months of age followed by probing under general&#xD;
      anesthesia (late probing). The possible advantages of early probing are the avoidance of&#xD;
      general anesthesia, immediate resolution of symptoms, lesser cost, and prevention of fibrosis&#xD;
      from inflammation in the nasolacrimal duct. The advantages of late probing include more&#xD;
      comfort with the procedure and the avoidance of the procedure completely. Both early and late&#xD;
      probing approaches are usually successful for treatment of NLDO in patients under 2 years of&#xD;
      age, with reported success proportions varying from between 54% to 98%. Although a number of&#xD;
      studies have found that probing was highly successful and without an age-related decline&#xD;
      until at least 4 years of age and beyond, there is a suspicion among other clinicians of a&#xD;
      clinically-important decline in the success proportions among progressively older age groups&#xD;
      of preschool children. A large prospective interventional case series might help to clarify&#xD;
      whether there is an age-related decline in success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Balloon catheter dilation has become popular for the initial surgical treatment of NLDO&#xD;
      especially in children older than one year. This procedure involves probing of the&#xD;
      nasolacrimal duct with a semiflexible wire probe with an inflatable balloon on the tip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nasolacrimal intubation has been used for primary treatment by clinicians in older children&#xD;
      or when the duct feels tight. While generally successful, there is less certainty of the&#xD;
      success proportions for this procedure when performed as a primary treatment. It is also&#xD;
      unknown how often this procedure is used for initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Probing of the nasolacrimal duct for the repair of NLDO is a very successful procedure in&#xD;
      infancy and childhood. Simple probing has long been the standard approach, though the age at&#xD;
      which the procedure declines in effectiveness is controversial. Clinicians have been urged by&#xD;
      manufacturers of medical equipment to consider intubation and balloon dilation even in the&#xD;
      age range in which probing is highly successful, to further increase the chance of success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective non-randomized study of the outcomes from many centers of all strategies might&#xD;
      allow better estimates of success for the techniques most often used over an extended age&#xD;
      range. Such a study might help to define factors associated with failure of each of the&#xD;
      techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been designed as an observational study that approximates standard clinical&#xD;
      practice. All procedures are consistent with standard care with the exception of a&#xD;
      questionnaire which the patient's parent will complete at each study visit on NLDO symptoms&#xD;
      and quality of life. The surgical center is not engaged in the research and no data will be&#xD;
      collected by surgical personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment success is defined as the absence of any clinical signs of nasolacrimal duct&#xD;
      obstruction: presence of epiphora, increased tear film, or mucous discharge.&#xD;
