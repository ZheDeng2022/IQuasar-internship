    <textblock>
      This study will look at the safety, tolerability and what the body does to CS-8958 given to&#xD;
      40 healthy volunteers 18-55 years old. CS-8958 is a dry-powder investigational drug that is&#xD;
      breathed into the lungs through an inhaler device. The researchers will collect information&#xD;
      about any problems that volunteers have while taking the drug and about changes in blood&#xD;
      pressure and how the heart is working. Volunteers will have breathing tests, physical&#xD;
      examinations, and blood samples collected for laboratory tests. The researchers will also&#xD;
      look at how much of the medication travels throughout the body versus how much stays only in&#xD;
      the lungs. Doses of the medication will be tested at one level and then at higher and higher&#xD;
      levels after a safety committee reviews the safety and tolerability information on volunteers&#xD;
      prior to the next higher dose being given. Each volunteer will participate for up to 6 weeks&#xD;
      from initial screening to the follow up visit and spend 7 days in the clinic.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a phase I, double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending single inhaled dose,&#xD;
      safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetic study of CS-8958 in healthy subjects. CS-8958 is an&#xD;
      investigational drug substance, which is formulated as a dry-powder. Capsules of the dry&#xD;
      powder are inserted into a FlowCaps® inhaler device. FlowCaps® is a re-fillable, dry-powder,&#xD;
      breath-actuated inhaler device, which holds up to 14 capsules. Upon actuation the powder&#xD;
      contained in one capsule is delivered to the respiratory tract. The primary study objective&#xD;
      is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of CS-8958 (5, 10, 20, and 40 mg) in healthy&#xD;
      subjects after a single dose administered via inhalation. Parameters are adverse events&#xD;
      (AEs), vital signs including blood pressure/pulse rate (BP/PR) measurements, functional&#xD;
      oxygen saturation of arterial haemoglobin (SpO2), electrocardiogram (ECG) examinations,&#xD;
      spirometry (Forced Vital Capacity (FVC), Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV1), FEV&#xD;
      percentage in 1 second (FEV 1%), FEV1/FVC ratio, Forced Expiratory Flow Rate (FEF) 25%-75%,&#xD;
      Peak Expiratory Flow Rate (PEFR), physical examinations, mood assessments, and laboratory&#xD;
      parameters. The secondary study objective is to assess the systemic exposure of CS-8958 and&#xD;
      its active metabolite R-125489 after single inhaled doses of CS-8958 in healthy subjects. At&#xD;
      Covance Clinical Research Unit Ltd, Leeds, UK, 40 subjects will be studied in 4 groups&#xD;
      (Groups A to D) with each group consisting of 10 subjects. Healthy male and female subjects&#xD;
      aged 18-55 years inclusive will be recruited for the study. There will be four&#xD;
      investigational product treatment groups (Groups A, B, C, and D). Within each group, subjects&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to Arm 1 or Arm 2. The study product doses will be administered in&#xD;
      an escalating manner. The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will review the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability data from each group, prior to administration of the next dose. Following these&#xD;
      reviews, the dose increment for subsequent groups may be increased, or the doses administered&#xD;
      may be reduced, and may be lower than the starting dose. The maximum dose level to be studied&#xD;
      will be 40 mg. The primary outcome measures include safety and tolerability. These outcome&#xD;
      measures will be addressed in terms of occurrences of treatment-emergent AEs, changes in&#xD;
      vital signs including BP and PR, SpO2, oral body temperature, ECG, spirometry (FVC, FEV1, FEV&#xD;
      1%, FEV1/FVC ratio, FEF 25-75% and PEFR), physical examinations, mood assessments, and&#xD;
      laboratory parameters. Secondary outcome measures will include pharmacokinetic parameters.&#xD;
      These parameters will be calculated for CS-8958 and R-125489 concentrations in plasma and&#xD;
      urine using a non-compartmental approach.&#xD;
