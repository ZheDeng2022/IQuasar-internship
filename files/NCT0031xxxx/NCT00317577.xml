  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Low-pressure (normal tension) glaucoma is a type of open-angle glaucoma resulting in damage&#xD;
      to the optic nerve and abnormalities of the visual field. Eye (intraocular) pressure in this&#xD;
      type of glaucoma is not higher than that usually considered to be normal (less than 21 mmHg)&#xD;
      for the eye. The present treatment of low-pressure glaucoma is also directed to lowering the&#xD;
      &quot;normal&quot; eye pressure. Both medications in this study, brimonidine and timolol, lower eye&#xD;
      pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory research over the past decade indicates the potential to treat glaucoma not only&#xD;
      by lowering eye pressure, but with treatments aimed at the damage occurring at the optic&#xD;
      nerve. One group of drugs, selective alpha2-adrenergic agonists, have been shown in&#xD;
      laboratory animals to protect against the effects of nerve damage following local stroke.&#xD;
      Brimonidine, one of the medications in the current study, is a selective alpha2-adrenergic&#xD;
      agonist which protects against damage to optic nerve in animal models of glaucoma..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the present study is that brimonidine eye drops provide protection to the&#xD;
      damaged optic nerve independent of lowering eye pressure in patients with low-pressure&#xD;
      glaucoma. This will be determined by (1) measuring eye pressure, (2) performing visual field&#xD;
      examinations, and (3) examination of the optic nerve.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The term glaucoma describes a specific pattern of optic nerve head and visual field damage&#xD;
      caused by a number of different diseases of the eye, most (but not all) of which are&#xD;
      associated with an elevated eye pressure. Glaucoma is currently considered to be a&#xD;
      progressive neurodegenerative disorder. Low-pressure glaucoma (LPG) is a type of open-angle&#xD;
      glaucoma (OAG) with progressive visual field and optic nerve damage despite an untreated eye&#xD;
      pressure in the statistically normal (mean 15.9, SD 2.9 mmHg) range, usually less than 21&#xD;
      mmHg. Therefore, in this condition, pressure-independent mechanisms (e.g., vascular or&#xD;
      structural defects of the optic nerve) may be the main, if not the sole, cause of the optic&#xD;
      neuropathy. LPG represents 6.7% to 68.3% of all OAGs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current glaucoma treatment is directed to lowering eye pressure using medical therapy (eye&#xD;
      drops), laser treatment, and/or surgery, to a level that stops progressive optic nerve&#xD;
      damage. The efficacy of lowering eye pressure in LPG has been reported. Both protocol medical&#xD;
      treatments, brimonidine and timolol, show similar efficacy to lower eye pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory research over the past decade indicates the potential to manage glaucoma not only&#xD;
      by lowering eye pressure, but with treatment modalities aimed at the damage occurring at the&#xD;
      optic nerve. Possible therapies may include agents effective as neuronal protectants to&#xD;
      increase or prolong the survival rate of injured retinal ganglion cells. Treatments could&#xD;
      also be directed to the rescue of nerve fibers from secondary degeneration, as stimulants to&#xD;
      expand dendritic fields, and to promote nerve regeneration or neural transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective α2-adrenergic agonists have been shown to have a neuroprotective effect in animal&#xD;
      models of focal cerebral ischemia. Brimonidine is reported to protect the optic nerve and&#xD;
      retinal ganglion cells from secondary degeneration following a partial crush lesion to the&#xD;
      adult rat optic nerve. One molecular mechanism for this neuroprotection may relate to&#xD;
      up-regulation of neuronal survival factors. In rats, systemic α2-adrenergic agonists induce&#xD;
      basic fibroblast growth factor mRNA in the retina. Treatment with α2-agonists before and&#xD;
      during constant light exposure reduces retinal photoreceptor degeneration in albino rats.&#xD;
      Animal studies demonstrate that topical administration of brimonidine results in&#xD;
      pharmacologic concentrations of drug in the vitreous (100-170 nM). Therefore, ocular dosing&#xD;
      with brimonidine provides a route for drug delivery to the retina in amounts sufficient to&#xD;
      bind and activate the α2-adrenoceptor and provide a neuroprotective effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesis is to evaluate the ability of topical treatment with 0.2% brimonidine, a&#xD;
      highly selective α2-adrenergic agonist, to impart neuroprotection to the damaged optic nerve&#xD;
      in patients with LPG. Comparison is made to 0.5% timolol, a nonselective β-adrenergic&#xD;
      antagonist, without reported neuroprotective properties. Patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to twice daily double-masked treatment with one of these drugs. Neuroprotection will be&#xD;
      assessed by evaluation of automated static visual fields performed at 4 month intervals for 4&#xD;
      years of treatment.&#xD;
