      Primary Objective: To assess the overall response rate (complete and partial response) to&#xD;
      Abraxane in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer with the addition of&#xD;
      Cetuximab on disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed annually in the United&#xD;
      States (Jemal et al, 2003), and over 30% of these patients are expected to die of their&#xD;
      malignancy. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for more than 90% of head and neck cancer cases.&#xD;
      Although metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis is rather uncommon, and despite&#xD;
      aggressive use of up-front concurrent radiation and cisplatin-based chemotherapy,&#xD;
      approximately 20% of the patients will develop metastases. Patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) have a poor prognosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsequent randomized study conducted by ECOG (E1393) compared high-dose paclitaxel (200&#xD;
      mg/m2) as a 24-hour infusion plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 with G-CSF support, to low dose&#xD;
      paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) as a 24-hour infusion, plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (Forastiere et al,&#xD;
      2001). Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic or recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the&#xD;
      head and neck, excluding nasopharyngeal primaries were eligible. No prior treatment for&#xD;
      recurrent/metastatic disease was allowed, but patients could have received chemotherapy as a&#xD;
      part of the initial curative therapy that should have been completed 6 months prior to study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No statistically significant difference could be demonstrated either in response rates or&#xD;
      survival between the two arms (Murphy et al, 2001). This study, however, indicated that&#xD;
      paclitaxel, a member of the taxane class of anti-tumor agent, is active in head and neck&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New agents to treat head and neck cancer need to be investigated. Abraxane, an albumin-bound&#xD;
      formulation of paclitaxel has shown significant single-agent activity in breast cancer and in&#xD;
      head and neck cancer. Recently, Abraxane has approved for use in metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
      Given previous randomized phase III trials indicated single agent chemotherapy fared as well&#xD;
      as combination chemotherapy regimen in terms of overall survival, this novel formulation&#xD;
      should be actively investigated in head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To assess the overall response rate (complete and partial response) to&#xD;
      Abraxane in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer with the addition of&#xD;
      Cetuximab on disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: 1. To assess the frequency and severity of toxicities associated with&#xD;
      this treatment. 2. To evaluate overall survival and progression-free survival in patients&#xD;
      with recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer treated with single agent Abraxane. 3.To&#xD;
      assess whether the addition of Cetuximab will re-sensitize head and neck cancer to Abraxane&#xD;
      after progression on single agent Abraxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND AND RATIONALE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 40,000 new cases of head and neck cancer are diagnosed annually in the United&#xD;
      States (Jemal et al, 2003), and over 30% of these patients are expected to die of their&#xD;
      malignancy. Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for more than 90% of head and neck cancer cases.&#xD;
      Although metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis is rather uncommon, and despite&#xD;
      aggressive use of up-front concurrent radiation and cisplatin-based chemotherapy,&#xD;
      approximately 20% of the patients will develop metastases. Patients with recurrent or&#xD;
      metastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) have a poor prognosis. Their&#xD;
      median survival is about 6-8 months. Selected patients with locally recurrent disease can be&#xD;
      treated with a curative intent with locoregional therapies, such as salvage surgery or&#xD;
      radiation (De Crevoisier et al, 1998); however the majority of these patients die of their&#xD;
      disease. Despite high response rates, combination chemotherapy has not been shown to produce&#xD;
      a survival benefit compared to single agents in randomized trials in patients with&#xD;
      recurrent/metastatic head and neck cancer (Forastiere et al, 1992; Jacobs et al, 1992; Clavel&#xD;
      et al, 1994). A phase III randomized study conducted by Southwest Oncology Group (SWOG)&#xD;
      compared cisplatin-based combination chemotherapy to single agent methotrexate (Forastiere et&#xD;
      al, 1992). The objective response rates were 32%, 21%, and 10%, for cisplatin/5-Fluorouracil&#xD;
      (5-FU), carboplatin/5-FU, and single methotrexate, respectively, but the median overall&#xD;
      survival was not statistically different between the three arms (ranged between 5 to 6.6&#xD;
      months). Moreover, toxicity was increased with combination therapy, especially with the&#xD;
      cisplatin-based regimen. Another randomized study conducted in the US demonstrated a&#xD;
      significantly higher response rate of 32% for the combination of cisplatin and 5-FU versus&#xD;
      17% and 13% for single agent cisplatin and 5-FU, respectively (Jacobs et al, 1992). However,&#xD;
      the median survival of all patients was 5.7 months, with no difference between the three&#xD;
      arms. Hematologic toxicity was increased in the combination arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subsequent randomized study conducted by ECOG (E1393) compared high-dose paclitaxel (200&#xD;
      mg/m2) as a 24-hour infusion plus cisplatin 75 mg/m2 with granulocyte-colony stimulating&#xD;
      factor (G-CSF) support, to low dose paclitaxel (135 mg/m2) as a 24-hour infusion, plus&#xD;
      cisplatin 75 mg/m2 (Forastiere et al, 2001). Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic or&#xD;
      recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck, excluding nasopharyngeal primaries&#xD;
      were eligible. No prior treatment for recurrent/metastatic disease was allowed, but patients&#xD;
      could have received chemotherapy as a part of the initial curative therapy that should have&#xD;
      been completed 6 months prior to study. Tow hundred and ten patients were randomized between&#xD;
      the 2 arms. No significant difference in outcome was observed. The response rate was 35% vs&#xD;
      36% and the median survival was 7.6 vs 6.8 months, in the high-dose vs low-dose paclitaxel&#xD;
      arms respectively. Patients with metastatic disease performed worse in terms of survival.&#xD;
      Previously untreated patients achieved a higher response rate of 58% compared to a response&#xD;
      rate of 32% observed in patients who have failed prior curative therapies. Substantial&#xD;
      toxicities were observed in this trial. Grade 4 neutropenia was seen in 61-71% of patients&#xD;
      and febrile neutropenia with hospitalization occurred in 27-39% of patients. The toxic death&#xD;
      rate was 10% (12% vs 9%) (Forastiere et al, 2001). It was concluded that the 24-hour&#xD;
      paclitaxel infusion was associated with unacceptable toxicity when combined with cisplatin.&#xD;
      Instead, a 3-hour paclitaxel infusion combined with cisplatin was advanced to further&#xD;
      testing. A more recent randomized trial conducted by ECOG (E1395) compared the combination of&#xD;
      paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 as a 3-hour infusion and cisplatin 75 mg/m2 to a standard cisplatin and&#xD;
      5-FU regimen. No statistically significant difference could be demonstrated either in&#xD;
      response rates or survival between the two arms (Murphy et al, 2001). This study, however,&#xD;
      indicated that paclitaxel, a member of the taxane class of anti-tumor agent, is active in&#xD;
      head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, another member anti-tumor class of taxane, Docetaxel (Taxotere) has been shown to&#xD;
      be active in advanced head and neck cancer. In a randomized phase III trial of&#xD;
      intensification of induction chemotherapy followed by radiation, the addition of docetaxel to&#xD;
      the induction regimen of cisplatin and 5-fluoruracil when compared to cisplatin and&#xD;
      5-fluoruracil alone resulted in a 3-month improvement in overall survival (Vermorken et al,&#xD;
      2004). Thus both members of the taxane family, paclitaxel and docetaxel, have proven&#xD;
      anti-tumor activity in head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      New agents to treat head and neck cancer need to be investigated. Abraxane, an albumin-bound&#xD;
      formulation of paclitaxel has shown significant single-agent activity in breast cancer and in&#xD;
      head and neck cancer. Recently, Abraxane has approved for use in metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
      Given previous randomized phase III trials indicated single agent chemotherapy fared as well&#xD;
      as combination chemotherapy regimen in terms of overall survival, this novel formulation&#xD;
      should be actively investigated in head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abraxane in solid tumor The clinical database included two single arm studies enrolling a&#xD;
      total of 106 patients and one multi-center randomized trial. The multi-center trial was&#xD;
      conducted in 460 patients with metastatic breast cancer who were randomized to receive either&#xD;
      Abraxane 260 mg/m² administered as a 30-minute infusion or paclitaxel 175 mg/m² given over 3&#xD;
      hours. Sixty-four percent of patients had impaired performance status (ECOG 1 or 2) at study&#xD;
      entry. Seventy-nine percent had visceral metastases and 76% had &gt; 3 sites of metastases.&#xD;
      Fifty-nine percent of patients had received one or more prior chemotherapy regimens, and 77%&#xD;
      had received an anthracycline-containing regimen. The objective response rate verified by&#xD;
      central review was 21.5% (95% Confidence interval (CI): 16.2% to 26.7%) for Abraxane compared&#xD;
      to 11.1% (95% CI: 6.9% to 15.1%) for paclitaxel (p=0.003). The conclusion of this phase III&#xD;
      trial is that Abraxane had statistically significant higher target lesion response rate (the&#xD;
      trial primary endpoint) (O'Shaughnessy et al, 2003).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On January 7, 2005 the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved Abraxane (albumin-bound&#xD;
      paclitaxel) for treatment of breast cancer after failure of combination chemotherapy for&#xD;
      metastatic disease or relapse within 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy based on the&#xD;
      statistically significant superior response rate from the randomized phase III trial&#xD;
      mentioned above. The recommended dose of Abraxane is 260 mg/m² administered intravenously&#xD;
      over 30 minutes every 3 weeks. No premedication to prevent hypersensitivity reactions is&#xD;
      required prior to Abraxane administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abraxane in Head and Neck Cancer The role of Abraxane in Head and Neck cancer has been&#xD;
      explored in a phase I study (Damascelli et al, 2001). Abraxane was injected intra-arterially&#xD;
      (carotid artery) in 31 patients with advanced Head and Neck cancer. The maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose in a single administration was determined to be 270 mg/m2 which is very close to the&#xD;
      approved dose of 260 mg/m2. Three patients achieved complete response and 19 patients&#xD;
      achieved partial response for a combined response rate of 76%. Side effects are very&#xD;
      tolerable including three patients with grade 4 neutropenia, and grade 2 non-hematologic&#xD;
      toxicities included: keratitis [1 patient], skin toxicity [5 patients], neurologic toxicities&#xD;
      [4 patients], and flu-like syndrome [7 patients]. However, intra-arterial administration is&#xD;
      technically challenging with potential serious side effects, cumbersome and not the&#xD;
      conventional way of delivering chemotherapy. In another phase 1 study of Abraxane in advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors, 3 out of 5 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma had responses lasting 25, 18&#xD;
      and 13+ weeks (Teng et al, 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the hint of anti-tumor activity of Abraxane in advanced Head and Neck cancer from the&#xD;
      above mentioned studies, this current study will seek to determine the efficacy of Abraxane&#xD;
      in recurrent or metastatic head and neck cancer at the dose of 260 mg/m2 given intravenously&#xD;
      every 3 weeks in a systemic manner. Abraxane is not FDA approved in the treatment of this&#xD;
      study disease; however, it is approved for patient use in the treatment of advanced breast&#xD;
      cancer that have failed traditional therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abraxane is a natural substance and is far more superior to conventional chemistry. Abraxane&#xD;
      is an effective treatment for aggressive cancers because it adversely affects the process of&#xD;
      cell division by preventing this restructuring. Other cells are also affected adversely, but&#xD;
      since cancer cells divide much faster than non-cancerous cells, they are far more susceptible&#xD;
      to Abraxane treatment, thus, the safety of the drug is no more or less then other&#xD;
      chemotherapy regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human albumin will be used along with the Abraxane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Cetuximab (IMC-225) (Erbitux) (NSC-714692) Cetuximab, a chimerized antibody of&#xD;
      the immunoglobulin gamma-1 (IgG1) subclass was originally derived from a mouse myeloma cell&#xD;
      line. The chimerization resulted in an antibody with binding affinity to epidermal growth&#xD;
      factor receptors (EGFR) greater than the natural ligand epidermal growth factor (EGF).&#xD;
      Cetuximab blocks binding EGF and transforming growth factor (TGFa) to EGFR and inhibits&#xD;
      ligand-induced activation of this tyrosine kinase receptor. Cetuximab also stimulates EGFR&#xD;
      internalization, effectively removing the receptor from the cell surface for interaction with&#xD;
      ligand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Precaution Cetuximab therapy should be used with caution in patients with known&#xD;
      hypersensitivity to Cetuximab, murine proteins, or any component of this product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administration of Cetuximab: In an effort to prevent a hypersensitivity reaction, all&#xD;
      patients should be premedicated with dexamethasone 20 mg by IV and diphenhydramine&#xD;
      hydrochloride 50 mg by IV given 30-60 minutes prior to the infusion of cetuximab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial/loading dose of cetuximab is 400 mg/m2 IV administered over 120 minutes. Patients&#xD;
      must be continuously observed during the infusion for signs of anaphylaxis and standard&#xD;
      resuscitative meds should be in close proximity. Vital signs should be taken prior to,&#xD;
      during, post and 1-hour post infusion for the initial dose. For subsequent infusions, vital&#xD;
      signs are recommended to be taken to and 1-hour post infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the loading dose, patients will receive weekly treatment with cetuximab IV over 60&#xD;
      minutes. The infusion rate of cetuximab should never exceed 5 mL/min. Patients should be&#xD;
      closely monitored for treatment-related adverse events, especially hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions, during the infusion and post-infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cetuximab is used for the treatment of patients with advanced head and neck cancer that has&#xD;
      spread to other parts of the body.&#xD;
