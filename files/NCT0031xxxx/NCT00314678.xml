      Clinically, there has been extensive experience with topotecan and cisplatin. Recently,&#xD;
      several investigators have evaluated the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and topotecan.&#xD;
      As expected, myelosuppression was the dose-limiting factor. Herben et al recently reported&#xD;
      the results of a phase I trial using the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin, and topotecan&#xD;
      as first line therapy in advanced stage ovarian cancer. Interestingly, the authors could not&#xD;
      achieve a dose of topotecan that would be considered &quot;optimal&quot; for the treatment of relapsed&#xD;
      disease in a single-agent fashion. The inability to utilize a therapeutic dose when combined&#xD;
      with either platinum or paclitaxel has been demonstrated in previous reports and affirms the&#xD;
      bone marrow suppressive effect. The clinical response rate from this trial was reported as&#xD;
      86.7%.&#xD;

      Malignant neoplasms of the ovary are the cause of more deaths than any other gynecologic&#xD;
      cancer. Approximately 26,500 new cases are diagnosed each year in the United States, and&#xD;
      about 14,500 deaths occur annually as a result of this disease. Clinicians continue to be&#xD;
      frustrated by both the paucity of data concerning the etiologic factors in epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer and by the failure to achieve a significant reduction in mortality over the past&#xD;
      several decades.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the introduction of cisplatin-based chemotherapy, no treatment has been shown to&#xD;
      improve survival in subjects with advanced ovarian cancer until the incorporation of&#xD;
      paclitaxel into primary therapy for this disease. In 1996, the Gynecologic Oncology Group&#xD;
      (GOG) published the results of a large prospective, randomized trial of cisplatin and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide compared to cisplatin and paclitaxel. The cisplatin plus paclitaxel regimen&#xD;
      was noted to be superior based on: 1) an overall improved response rate; 2) an increased&#xD;
      clinical response rate (51% vs. 31%); 3) an increased rate of negative second look&#xD;
      laparotomies; 4) an increase in median progression free survival; and importantly 5) an&#xD;
      increased overall median survival (38 months vs. 24 months). The GOG results were recently&#xD;
      confirmed by the Canadian- European consortium randomized phase III trial (OV 10).&#xD;
&#xD;
      These large randomized trials established the combination of paclitaxel and cisplatin as the&#xD;
      standard, first line therapy for women with advanced ovarian cancer following cytoreductive&#xD;
      surgery. Although the majority of women with advanced ovarian cancer will demonstrate an&#xD;
      objective response to this combination; the response is generally of limited duration. The&#xD;
      five-year survival for advanced stage ovarian cancer is 20-40%. Consequently, there remains a&#xD;
      need for an improved chemotherapeutic approach in the management of ovarian cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan is a semi-synthetic analog of camptothecin, a topoisomerase inhibitor. It has been&#xD;
      investigated in a number of phase II trials as salvage therapy for recurrent ovarian cancer.&#xD;
      Overall response rates have ranged from 6% to 27%. In a randomized comparative trial of&#xD;
      topotecan versus paclitaxel, overall response rates were 21% and 14% respectively. The median&#xD;
      survival for topotecan was 63 weeks as compared to 53 weeks for paclitaxel. Both drugs&#xD;
      demonstrated higher response rates in platinum-sensitive tumors than platinum-resistant&#xD;
      tumors. These data suggest that topotecan may be as active as paclitaxel, and partially&#xD;
      non-cross resistant with cisplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Topotecan may be a better agent than paclitaxel for use in combination with cisplatin for&#xD;
      multiple reasons. First, Kern et al demonstrated that paclitaxel may antagonize the activity&#xD;
      of cisplatin. Second, topotecan has been demonstrated to be synergistic with both cisplatin&#xD;
      and paclitaxel in vitro. It has been demonstrated that topotecan can dramatically potentiate&#xD;
      the effects of platinum, perhaps by its ability to inhibit repair of platinum-DNA adducts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinically, there has been extensive experience with topotecan and cisplatin. Recently,&#xD;
      several investigators have evaluated the combination of paclitaxel, cisplatin and topotecan.&#xD;
      As expected, myelosuppression was the dose-limiting factor. Herben et al recently reported&#xD;
