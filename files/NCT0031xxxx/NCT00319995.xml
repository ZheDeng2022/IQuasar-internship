  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 3, randomized, parallel-group, multicenter, double-dummy, double-blind study&#xD;
      with a screening period. Subjects will receive one of the following three treatment groups&#xD;
      for 15 days: loratadine 10 mg/montelukast 10 mg combination, pseudoephedrine 240 mg, or&#xD;
      placebo. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of the combination of&#xD;
      loratadine/montelukast, a once-daily tablet containing 10 mg loratadine and 10 mg&#xD;
      montelukast, compared with placebo in subjects with seasonal allergic rhinitis (SAR) in&#xD;
      relieving the symptom of nasal congestion. The safety profile of combined&#xD;
      loratadine/montelukast relative to placebo and pseudoephedrine will also be evaluated.&#xD;
