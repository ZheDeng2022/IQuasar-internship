      RATIONALE: Telemedicine may help in the treatment of depression and/or pain caused by cancer.&#xD;
      It is not yet known whether telemedicine is more effective than standard care in treating&#xD;
      depression and/or pain caused by cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase III randomized clinical trial is studying telemedicine to see how well it&#xD;
      works compared to standard care in treating patients with depression and/or pain caused by&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the effectiveness of a state-wide, telemedicine intervention with standard care&#xD;
           in cancer patients with clinical depression and/or cancer-related pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare improvement in clinical depression and/or cancer-related pain in patients&#xD;
           undergoing these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare health-related quality of life, functional status, and patient satisfaction with&#xD;
           treatment in patients undergoing these interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the economic benefits of these interventions in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a randomized, longitudinal, multicenter study. Patients are stratified&#xD;
      according to study site and type of symptom (pain only vs depression only vs pain and&#xD;
      depression). Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I (standard care): Patients receive treatment for pain, depression, and other&#xD;
           symptoms from their oncologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (telemedicine intervention): Patients undergo automated, home-based symptom&#xD;
           monitoring either by telephone or the Internet, depending on preference, coupled with&#xD;
           telephonic care management by a clinical specialist. Patients complete questionnaires&#xD;
           via the Internet or undergo standardized interviews via telephone measuring depression,&#xD;
           pain, quality of life, and other patient-reported variables twice weekly for&#xD;
           approximately 1 month, once weekly for 2 months, twice a month for 3 months, and then&#xD;
           once a month for 6 months. A clinical specialist trained in treating the symptoms of&#xD;
           pain and depression also contacts the patient by phone to assess symptom severity and&#xD;
           initiate treatment. A follow-up call is made at 1-2 weeks to assess symptom severity,&#xD;
           adherence, and adverse effects. Patients with depression receive 2 additional follow-up&#xD;
           calls in the first 12 weeks. The clinical specialist also calls the patient when&#xD;
           automated monitoring indicates inadequate symptom improvement or side effects, or the&#xD;
           patient requests to be contacted. The clinical specialist works with the patient's&#xD;
           regular doctor in adjusting medicines and treatment for symptoms as needed. Patients who&#xD;
           do not complete their scheduled assessments receive an automated call or e-mail message&#xD;
           reminding them to complete the symptoms questionnaires. Patients who do not respond to&#xD;
           this reminder within 24 hours are contacted by the clinical specialist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In both arms, patients are interviewed at baseline, 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. Patients are&#xD;
      asked questions about pain, depression, other physical and emotional symptoms, work&#xD;
      activities, quality of life, and satisfaction with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 480 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
