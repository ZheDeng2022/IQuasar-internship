      -  The purpose of the phase I portion of the study is to determine the safety and&#xD;
           feasibility of neoadjuvant bortezomib in combination with docetaxel and cisplatin&#xD;
           followed by surgery in early stage non-small cell lung cancer, via a multi-cohort dose&#xD;
           escalation trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The phase II portion of the study will look at the clinical response rate and the&#xD;
           pathology response rate. Other purposes are to look at surgical morbidity, mortality and&#xD;
           respectability rates. Molecular correlates of response and survival to this neoadjuvant&#xD;
           regimen will be explored.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:(Phase I and II unless otherwise specified)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects may either be suspected to have non-small cell lung cancer with&#xD;
             plans for a diagnostic biopsy, or must have a histological or cytological diagnosis of&#xD;
             non-small cell lung cancer. For those suspected of having non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
             histological confirmation must be obtained prior to commencing treatment on protocol.&#xD;
             During the phase II portion of this protocol, all subjects will be asked to undergo&#xD;
             FNA/core biopsy of the primary tumor for correlative studies even if they already came&#xD;
             to screening with prior biopsy (histological confirmation of disease). However,&#xD;
             subjects refusing repeat FNA/core biopsy will not be excluded from protocol entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must have stage IB ,IIA ,or IIIA. T stage must be defined by CT and PET&#xD;
             imaging. Nodal status must be determined by CT/PET imaging, N2 disease must be&#xD;
             confirmed by mandatory mediastinoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be chemotherapy and radiation therapy naïve&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No history of prior malignancy except adequately treated basal cell or squamous cell&#xD;
             skin cancer, or adequately treated cervical carcinoma in situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age greater than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Zubrod performance status of 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ and marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  absolute neutrophil count greater than or equal to 1,500&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  platelets greater than or equal to 100,000/ml&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  total bilirubin within normal institutional limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  hemoglobin greater than 8.0 g/dl&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  AST and ALT and Alkaline Phosphatase must be within the range allowing for&#xD;
             eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine within normal institutional limits OR Calculated creatinine clearance&#xD;
             greater than or equal to 60 ml/min.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subject of child bearing potential and men must agree to use adequate&#xD;
             contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; or abstinence) prior to&#xD;
             study entry, during treatment and for at least 3 months thereafter. Women of child&#xD;
             bearing potential must have a documented negative pregnancy associated ß-HCG during&#xD;
             screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Predicted post-resection FEV1 of 1.0 L or more&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and willingness to sign a written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must not be receiving nor plan on receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of severe hypersensitivity reaction to docetaxel or other&#xD;
             drugs formulated with polysorbate 80.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of known allergy to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to&#xD;
             bortezomib or other agents used in this study (i.e. Boron, Mannitol).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, congestive heart failure or myocardial infarction within the preceding 6&#xD;
             months, symptomatic cardiac arrhythmia, unstable angina pectoris, psychiatric illness&#xD;
             or social situations that would limit compliance with study prescribed therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because patients with immune deficiency are at increased risk of lethal infections&#xD;
             when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy, HIV-positive patients are excluded from&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peripheral neuropathy: greater than grade 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inclusion of Women and Minorities&#xD;
&#xD;
        Both men and women of all ethnic groups are eligible for this trial if they meet the&#xD;
        eligibility criteria. To date, there is no information that suggests differences in drug&#xD;
        metabolism or disease response would be expected in one group compared to another. All&#xD;
        efforts will be made to accrue a representative sample. If differences in outcome appear to&#xD;
        be associated with gender or ethnicity, then perhaps a follow-up study can be designed to&#xD;
        investigate these differences more fully. The catchment's area for USC is Los Angeles&#xD;
        County.&#xD;
