  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD4+ cells are white blood cells that regulate the immune system by controlling the&#xD;
           strength and quality of the immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CD25+ cells are a subset of CD4+ cells that suppress or prevent immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RFT-5-dgA is an immunotoxin (substance that kills specific cells in the immune system)&#xD;
           that kills CD25+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In mouse studies, RFT-5-dgA showed anti-tumor activity in animals studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To determine whether the immune system of patients with metastatic melanoma&#xD;
      (melanoma that has spread beyond the original site) can cause tumors to shrink if the&#xD;
      patients are given RFT-5-dgA to remove their CD25+ cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility: Patients 18 years of age and older with metastatic melanoma whose disease has&#xD;
      progressed after receiving standard treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients receive RFT-5-dgA through a vein every other day for a total of 3 doses (one&#xD;
           treatment course). Patients have routine blood tests during the week of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four to 5 weeks after the last dose, patients are evaluated with a physical examination,&#xD;
           blood tests and scans and x-rays to evaluate their tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients whose tumor has shrunk or remained stable may be offered additional treatment&#xD;
           with RFT-5-dgA up to a total of four courses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergo leukapheresis or have several tubes of blood drawn from a vein to&#xD;
           determine the effects of RFT-5-dgA on the immune system. This is done before the first&#xD;
           dose of RFT-5-dgA, after the first three doses, and possibly during subsequent treatment&#xD;
           courses in those patients who receive additional treatment. For leukapheresis, blood is&#xD;
           collected through a needle in an arm vein and flows through a catheter into a machine&#xD;
           that separates it into its components by spinning. The white cells are extracted and the&#xD;
           rest of the blood is returned through another needle in the other arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RFT5-dgA is an immunotoxin comprised of the IL-2Ra-specific murine IgG1 antibody RFT5&#xD;
           linked to deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgA) via the sterically hindered&#xD;
           heterobifunctional disulfide linker SMPT&#xD;
           (4-succinimidyl-oxycarbonyl-a-methyl-a-(2-pyridyldithio)-toluene).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  RFT5-dgA is a recombinant immunotoxin that selectively targets CD25 expressing cells in&#xD;
           vivo. Further, treatment of human PBMC with RFT5-dgA in vitro results in the&#xD;
           preferential depletion of CD25+ Treg cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Depletion of Treg cells can enhance tumor protection to tumor-associated antigens&#xD;
           expressed as self antigens and the RFT5-dgA immunotoxin had potent antitumor effects in&#xD;
           SCID mice xenografted with L540 cells which express CD25.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The MTD established in the phase I trial of RFT5-dgA was 15mg/m(2)/course IV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective is to determine whether objective clinical responses can be&#xD;
           obtained in patients with metastatic melanoma following administration of RFT5-dgA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Secondary objectives will determine whether changes occur in levels of CD4+CD25+&#xD;
           regulatory T cells (Treg cells) in peripheral blood from before to after treatment and&#xD;
           evaluate the toxicity profile of patients treated on this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients greater than 18 years of age with measurable metastatic melanoma, an expected&#xD;
           survival greater than three months, who have progressed after receiving standard therapy&#xD;
           will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard clinical laboratory values must be normal for study inclusion and patients may&#xD;
           not be pregnant, breast-feeding or require anticoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients must be willing to undergo leukapheresis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with active infections, other major medical disorders, HAMA levels greater than&#xD;
           1 ug/mL, or who have had prior radiotherapy or who have extensive lung disease will be&#xD;
           excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will receive 3 mg/m(2) RFT5-dgA intravenously every other day for a total of 3&#xD;
           doses (one course).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Four to five weeks after the last dose, patients will undergo tumor evaluation,&#xD;
           evaluation of changes in T-regulatory cells (CD4+CD25+cells and Foxp3 expression), and&#xD;
           toxicity assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One additional course may be administered to patients with stable disease or partial or&#xD;
           complete response.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Up to 41 evaluable patients may be accrued to determine whether theRFT5-dgA can produce&#xD;
           a modest response rate targeted to be 20 percent (p1=0.20)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Enrollment reflects the anticipated enrollment. Actual enrollment is unknown due to no&#xD;
           longer having access to the data as records were destroyed&#xD;
