  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the effect of multiple dosing of 125 mg azimilide on glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (GFR) and total creatinine clearance (GFR + active secretion) in healthy&#xD;
      subjects. Also, it will assess the effect of multiple dosing of 125 mg azimilide on renal&#xD;
      hemodynamics (RPF) in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose, single-site study&#xD;
      in healthy male and female volunteers. Oral azimilide 125 mg or placebo will be administered&#xD;
      every 12 hours for 3 days, followed by 125 mg every 24 hours for 3 days. The study will&#xD;
      include a total of 21 healthy subjects (14 active and 7 placebo), all of whom will be&#xD;
      confined at the study center for 9 nights.&#xD;
