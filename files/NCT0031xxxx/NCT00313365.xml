      Joint spaces are aseptic areas, meaning that they do not contain microorganisms. Any injury&#xD;
      to the joint space could cause the entry of microorganisms, with the potential to cause&#xD;
      infection. Septic arthritis refers to the infection of a joint space with microorganisms,&#xD;
      usually bacteria. This invasion initiates a process of inflammation and causes irreversible&#xD;
      damage to a joint cavity. Patients typically present with pain, swelling, decreased motion,&#xD;
      and inability to use the joint. When bacteria enter a joint space, the host immune system&#xD;
      responds by concentrating inflammatory cells within the joint. While inflammatory cells serve&#xD;
      to eliminate the bacteria, they also produce substances that not only attack bacteria but&#xD;
      also could destroy the joint space. These substances are called enzymes, and they could&#xD;
      damage the cartilage (translucent fairly elastic tissue around the joint) and adjacent bone&#xD;
      in the process. Because cartilage has a poor ability to cure itself, this process may lead to&#xD;
      irreversible damage and chronic joint dysfunction. Studies have found that signs of early&#xD;
      joint damage can be found within hours following joint infection. This is true even if&#xD;
      antibiotic therapy (medicine to fight the infection) is started within 24 hours of infection.&#xD;
      Also, delay in treatment has been related to poor outcome. However, the best method of&#xD;
      treating septic arthritis has yet to be determined. Currently, there are two accepted ways&#xD;
      for treating septic arthritis: serial needle aspiration (introducing a needle in the joint to&#xD;
      aspirate the inflammatory liquid), and surgical lavage (opening and cleaning the joint space&#xD;
      in the OR under anesthesia). Antibiotics are also used with these two forms of treatment.&#xD;
      Supporters of surgery believe that the most dependable method of eliminating bacteria from a&#xD;
      joint space is through arthrotomy (opening the joint with a surgical incision) and lavage&#xD;
      (irrigation of the joint with copious saline solution) .Promoters of serial needle aspiration&#xD;
      support this method because it is quick, does not require opening the joint space, and can be&#xD;
      performed without anesthesia.At present, there are no conclusive studies comparing the two&#xD;
      techniques. Hopefully, this study will help delineate the best course of management.&#xD;

      The principle objectives and justification for this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine whether arthrotomy with irrigation and debridement or repeated arthrocentesis&#xD;
      provides a clear benefit over the other for the treatment of septic arthritis in adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Septic arthritis is an infection with consequential inflammation of a joint space by various&#xD;
      microorganisms. Typically it is bacterial in origin and results by hematological seeding or&#xD;
      direct invasion of a joint space. This invasion initiates a cascade of inflammation and&#xD;
      causes irreversible damage to a joint cavity. Patients typically present with edema,&#xD;
      erythema, substantial decrease in range of motion, and the inability to use the joint. It&#xD;
      remains a significant medical issue accounting for 0.2-0.7% of hospital admissions in the&#xD;
      United States with a mortality rate ranging from 2-14%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once bacteria enter a joint space it produces a purulent fluid that induces an acute&#xD;
      inflammatory response. The body's inflammatory cells, although aids in eradicating the&#xD;
      bacteria, produces enzymes that also damage extracellular cartilage matrix, synovium, and&#xD;
      adjacent bone in a relatively short period of time.1,2 Because adult cartilage has poor&#xD;
      regenerative capabilities, this process leads to irreversible damage and chronic joint&#xD;
      dysfunction.4 Studies have found that signs of early joint damage can be found within hours&#xD;
      following joint infection.1, 5 This is true even if antibiotic therapy is started within 24&#xD;
      hours of infection. Also, delay in initiation of treatment has repeatedly found to be a major&#xD;
      determinant of poor outcome.6 Thus, it is well accepted that early drainage of purulent&#xD;
      material in addition to antibiotics is imperative for preventing irreparable articular&#xD;
      damage.4 However, the best method for doing so has yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently studies have yet to clearly provide an ideal method of management. Although animal&#xD;
      models seem to support early surgical intervention, retrospective studies in human reveal&#xD;
      that arthrocentesis may provide better outcomes but with an increased risk of&#xD;
      mortality.4,7,10 Proponents of surgery believe the proper visualization, debridement, and&#xD;
      lavage can only be conducted through surgery thus protecting the articular cartilage from&#xD;
      rapid destruction.8-10,12,13 Whereas proponents of medical management argue the needle&#xD;
      aspiration is quick, less invasive, and can be conducted multiple times to prevent&#xD;
      accumulation of pus and follow effectiveness of antibiotic treatment.7,11&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized Prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of Patients: We will select 200 patients admitted to Grady for septic arthritis of&#xD;
      the ankle, knee, hip, wrist, elbow, or shoulder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with acute onset of symptoms of less than or equal to two weeks' duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with infection of only the following joints: ankle, knee, hip, wrist, elbow, or&#xD;
           shoulder&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with proven bacterial infection by positive gram stain or culture of synovial&#xD;
           fluid and with white blood cell count in synovial flood consistent with infection&#xD;
           (75,000 - 150,000 cells/mm3.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cases with negative synovial fluid cultures if positive blood cultures are present and&#xD;
           associated with typical inflammatory synovial fluid changes without other identifiable&#xD;
           sources of infection and if antibiotic therapy had been initiated earlier to explain&#xD;
           negative synovial fluid cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Monoarticular arthritis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gonococcal infections&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Infected prosthetic joints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adjacent osteomyelitis preceding joint infection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Septic arthritis occurring as an incidental event late in the course of otherwise fatal&#xD;
           illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients that are 17 years old or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Polyarticular arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definitive diagnosis for septic arthritis will be made following analysis of the joint fluid&#xD;
      for a positive gram stain/culture and white blood cell (WBC) count consistent with infection&#xD;
      (75,000-150,000 cells/mm3) as discussed above. Plain films of the involved joint will be&#xD;
      acquired to evaluate for soft tissue edema, osteomyelitis, as well as to rule out other&#xD;
      pathological involvement. Patients' blood sample will also be evaluated for central blood&#xD;
      count (CBC), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), C- reactive protein (CRP), and cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patients are admitted for treatment of the infected joint, they will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study. The nature of the study will be explained by a member of the&#xD;
      orthopaedic department, and signed consent will be obtained prior to inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be two indistinguishable sealed envelopes created at the beginning of the study&#xD;
      for each patient enrolled. Inside one envelope will be a piece of paper with Group I written&#xD;
      on it. Inside the other envelope will be a piece of paper with Group II written on it.&#xD;
      Patients will be randomly placed in either group I receiving arthrotomy with irrigation and&#xD;
      debridement or group II undergoing repeated arthrocentesis based upon which envelope is&#xD;
      chosen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Method for Group I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing surgical treatment will undergo surgery in the first 72 hours. During the&#xD;
      procedure, there will be direct visualization of joint cavity, thorough debridement of any&#xD;
      adhesions or necrotic tissue, and irrigation-drainage with saline solution to eliminate as&#xD;
      much debris as possible. Synovectomy will not be performed. Temporary drainage catheters will&#xD;
      then be inserted into the joint for 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Method for Group II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group will undergo daily bedside arthrocentesis. The involved joint will be&#xD;
      prepped and draped in a sterile fashion prior to every aspiration. As much infected joint&#xD;
      fluid will be removed as possible. Each aspirated fluid will be evaluated for gross&#xD;
      appearance, cell count, gram stain and culture, glucose concentration, and crystal analysis.&#xD;
      Arthrocentesis will be performed daily until effusion resolves or until aspirate no longer&#xD;
      yields a purulent exudate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After Treatment Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appropriate antibiotics will be provided to both groups intravenously then changed to oral&#xD;
      pills upon discharge for a total course of 14 days following irrigation and debridement or&#xD;
      final arthrocentesis. Also physical therapy and pain medications will be provided to all&#xD;
      patients. The affected joint will be initially immobilized in a position of function. One the&#xD;
      infection is under control, range of motion will be initiated slowly but deliberately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Findings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' blood sample will also be evaluated and followed for central blood count (CBC),&#xD;
      erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), and c-reactive protein (CRP) once daily during hospital&#xD;
      stay and once at each follow up appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of Follow up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 2 months, and 6 months post discharge. At each&#xD;
      follow-up appointment, patients will be evaluated for symptomatic improvement as well as&#xD;
      examined for residual edema, range of motion, recurrence of infection, radiological changes,&#xD;
      and erythema.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A sample size of 100 patients per group achieves 94% statistical power to detect a difference&#xD;
      of 20% between the null hypothesis that 90% in both the surgery and aspiration groups will&#xD;
      clear infection within 2 months and the alternative hypothesis that the proportion in the&#xD;
      aspiration group that clear infection is 70% using a two-sided Z test with continuity&#xD;
      correction and unpooled variance (significance level of 0.05). All power calculations were&#xD;
      performed with PASS 2005 software. This calculation was performed by Kirk Easley, Senior&#xD;
      Associate at the Biostatistics Department, Rollins School of Public Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome will be divided into four groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Good: if the patient recovered completely without any decrease in range of motion and only&#xD;
      experienced minimal residual pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fair: if there is decrease in ROM up to 10%, moderate pain, signs of recurrence Poor: if&#xD;
      there is greater than 10% decrease in ROM, &gt;10 degrees of flexion deformity, ankylosis,&#xD;
      osteomyelitis, persistent effusion, and/or severe or disabling pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Death: Patients who died for any reason in the course of their joint infection&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points for this study would be the absence of infection or the need to have an additional&#xD;
      procedure for infection control (i.e. secondary surgical lavage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Form-36 (SF-36), Musculoskeletal Functional Assessment (MFA), and Western Ontario and&#xD;
      McMaster Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaires will also be used to assess outcome at&#xD;
      each follow-up appointment. The data will be collected into an Excel spreadsheet and analyzed&#xD;
      to determine one treatment options significantly improves outcome over the other. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be achieved by using Fisher's exact test. A P value &lt;0.05 will be considered as&#xD;
      statistically significant. This study is not expected to cause any additional risk for our&#xD;
      patients because both forms of treatment are accepted as standard of treatment and used&#xD;
      nationally.&#xD;
