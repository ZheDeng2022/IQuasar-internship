  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The visual disorder of amblyopia affects 2% to 3% of the population. Amblyopia is a&#xD;
      developmental condition that is characterized by reduced vision of the eye due to the&#xD;
      presence of a sensory impediment during visual development, such as strabismus (ocular&#xD;
      misalignment) or anisometropia (unequal refractive error), occurring early in life. Recent&#xD;
      studies in humans and animals point towards a cortical locus for the processing deficit in&#xD;
      amblyopia, revealing sensory deficits at the signal cell level that include reduced spatial&#xD;
      resolution, reduced contrast sensitivity, and a reduced number of binocular neural cells. In&#xD;
      the retina, however, no abnormalities have yet been reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Like in the brain blood flow in the retina is coupled to neuronal activity. This phenomenon&#xD;
      has been measured by different study groups with non invasive techniques in the brain and&#xD;
      retina. We therefore use a Zeiss fundus camera for the assessment of retinal vessel&#xD;
      diameters. This so called retinal vessel analyzer (RVA) is a combination of a fundus camera&#xD;
      connected to a high resolution video camera equipped with a software based analyzing system.&#xD;
      An unprecedented reproducibility and sensitivity of retinal vessel diameter measurements is&#xD;
      attained with this system. In addition this system allows real time analysis of retinal&#xD;
      vessels as well as off-line determinations from video tape. A special provocation test, which&#xD;
      minimizes risk and discomfort to the subject under study is applied through the illumination&#xD;
      pathway of the fundus camera: Diffuse luminance flicker is used as a stimulus to augment&#xD;
      intrinsic mechanisms by which the retina can vary the vascular supply, in correspondence with&#xD;
      local variations of functional activity. This system allows to study the flicker response of&#xD;
      retinal vessels, which is within a magnitude of 6 to 8%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the exact mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are not fully understood. Especially&#xD;
      in the eye it is not clear whether it is an exclusive metabolic effect within the retina and&#xD;
      the surrounding blood vessels or dependent of central regulatory brain functions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the current study is to improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying&#xD;
      flicker evoked responses of retinal blood vessels in humans. It is not clear whether the&#xD;
      retina of amblyopic eyes can regulate retinal blood flow in response to increased metabolic&#xD;
      demands as induced during flicking light stimulation. A detail understanding of the metabolic&#xD;
      and functional processes within the retina of patients with amblyopia is a prerequisite for&#xD;
      further research to prevent amblyopia.&#xD;
