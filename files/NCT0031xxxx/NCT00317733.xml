    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and effectiveness of 110 mg ketoprofen&#xD;
      in Transfersome applied to the skin twice daily as compared to placebo and oral celecoxib 200&#xD;
      mg per day for the relief of signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee for a period of&#xD;
      six weeks.&#xD;

      This is a multicenter, randomized (patients are assigned different treatments based on&#xD;
      chance), double-blind (neither the patient nor the physician knows whether drug or placebo is&#xD;
      being taken, or at what dosage), double-dummy, parallel group, placebo- and active-controlled&#xD;
      study to determine the safety and effectiveness of 110 mg of ketoprofen in Transfersome,&#xD;
      applied to the skin, in subjects experiencing at least moderate pain when not taking&#xD;
      analgesic medication secondary to osteoarthritis pain of the knee. The study hypothesis is&#xD;
      that ketoprofen in Transfersome applied to the skin twice daily will be more effective than&#xD;
      placebo for the relief of the signs and symptoms of osteoarthritis of the knee as measured by&#xD;
      the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) of the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Index (WOMAC)&#xD;
      pain, WOMAC function and subject global asessment of response to therapy at Week 6. WOMAC is&#xD;
      a questionaire consisting of 24 questions designed to assess the three dimensions of pain,&#xD;
      disability and joint stiffness in osteoarthritis of the knee. Safety evaluations include&#xD;
      reports of adverse events, laboratory tests and skin irritation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive one of the following treatments for six weeks - 110 mg ketoprofen in&#xD;
      Transfersome applied to the skin twice per day plus one placebo capsule administered orally&#xD;
      twice per day, 100 mg celecoxib administered orally twice per day plus placebo Transfersome&#xD;
      applied to the skin twice per day, Placebo Transfersome applied to the skin twice per day&#xD;
      plus one placebo capsule administered orally twice twice per day.&#xD;
