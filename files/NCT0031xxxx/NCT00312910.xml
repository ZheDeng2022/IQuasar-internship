  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether probiotics are effective in the prevention&#xD;
      of the complications of liver cirrhosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colonic bacteria clearly play a major role in the pathogenesis of major complications in&#xD;
      patients with liver cirrhosis. By producing ammonia and endotoxins they can cause hepatic&#xD;
      encephalopathy , and their translocation from the gut to the peritoneal cavity is the major&#xD;
      mechanism for spontaneous bacterial peritonitis. There are also new studies suggesting a&#xD;
      possible connection between bacterial translocation and bleeding from esophageal varices.&#xD;
      Some of the therapeutic measures for the treatment and prevention of complications in&#xD;
      cirrhotic patients, such as antibiotics and lactulose, are partially directed against gut&#xD;
      bacteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In recent years there is a growing interest in the effect of probiotic bacteria on gut flora&#xD;
      and prevention of infection. They were found to prevent pediatric infectious diarrhea and&#xD;
      antibiotic-associated diarrhea- especially those caused by Clostridium difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probiotic bacteria, among which the most common are the lactose fermenting Lactobacilli,&#xD;
      inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria by acidifying the gut lumen, competing for&#xD;
      nutrients, and by producing antimicrobial substances. They adhere to the gut mucosa and by&#xD;
      that are thought to prevent bacterial translocation from the gut. These effects of probiotics&#xD;
      raised the idea that they may have a role in the treatment and prevention of cirrhosis&#xD;
      complications. A recent study examined the effect of probiotics on patients with minimal&#xD;
      chronic hepatic encephalopathy. Hepatic encephalopathy was reversed in 50% of the patients&#xD;
      receiving probiotics. These patients also demonstrated a significant reduction of blood&#xD;
      levels of ammonia, bilirubin and ALT, and of pathologic bacteria in stool cultures. This&#xD;
      study showed promising results but was carried out on a relatively small population.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the effect of probiotics on the prevention of hepatic encephalopathy and other&#xD;
      major complications of cirrhosis has not been studied yet. Therefore, more studies are needed&#xD;
      to establish the role of probiotics in patients with cirrhosis.&#xD;
