  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recent research suggests that overweight persons who are physically active may be&#xD;
      significantly less likely to develop health complications and less likely to die early when&#xD;
      compared even with lean persons who are not physically active. Previous treatment programs&#xD;
      for people who have struggled with their weight have focused almost entirely on weight loss&#xD;
      as the main goal of treatment. Our research program has a different focus. We hope to improve&#xD;
      health and healthy self esteem independent of body weight by focusing instead on increasing&#xD;
      physical activity as the main goal of treatment. This is a small study designed to see if&#xD;
      this approach would be appealing to persons who are struggling with their weight who are&#xD;
      currently sedentary. It is designed for people who are otherwise fairly healthy for whom&#xD;
      exercise is reasonably safe. Participants are randomly (by chance) assigned to participate in&#xD;
      the experimental treatment program or instead to meet with their regular primary care doctor.&#xD;
      Those who are assigned to meet with their regular doctor can access traditional weight loss&#xD;
      resources such as Weight Watchers, Jenny Craig, Fitness centers etc... After the experiment&#xD;
      is complete, these participants will have the opportunity to participate in the experimental&#xD;
      treatment program.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVE: Epidemiologic evidence suggests that overweight persons who engage in modest&#xD;
      amounts of physical activity - even that insufficient to produce or maintain weight loss -&#xD;
      are at significantly reduced risk for health complications including all-cause mortality.&#xD;
      Interventions for overweight persons targeting increased physical activity rather than weight&#xD;
      loss as the main outcome of treatment have not been well studied and could represent simpler,&#xD;
      more sustainable, and more cost-effective approaches in addressing the obesity epidemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHOD: Pilot randomized controlled trial. Sedentary patients with BMI 25-45, and no major&#xD;
      contraindications for unsupervised physical activity recruited. Participants randomized to&#xD;
      receive either brief consultation consisting of 3 in-person meetings, a workbook, and limited&#xD;
      telephone contact or usual care with their medical provider including access to community&#xD;
      weight-loss groups/resources. Intervention therapists novice pre-professional students. The&#xD;
      intervention is manualized and coded for treatment integrity. The main outcome measures are&#xD;
      Cohen's d effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals for the change in moderate-equivalent&#xD;
      intensity physical activity/week at 3 months relative to baseline assessed by a blinded&#xD;
      assessor using the Stanford 7-Day Physical Activity Recall. Secondary outcomes include effect&#xD;
      sizes and confidence intervals for changes in cardiorespiratory fitness and depression using&#xD;
      the modified Canadian Aerobic Fitness test and Beck Depression Inventory. Analyses to be&#xD;
      performed by intention to treat. Missing data to be imputed by baseline observation carried&#xD;
      forward.&#xD;
