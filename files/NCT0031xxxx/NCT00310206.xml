  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to compare how the body reacts to different strengths&#xD;
      of an H5N1 flu vaccine when given by different routes of injection (injection into the skin&#xD;
      or into the muscle). It will also compare how antibodies (proteins produced by the body's&#xD;
      immune system that recognize and help fight infections and other foreign substances in the&#xD;
      body) are made after receiving the H5N1 flu vaccine. Participants will include 100 healthy&#xD;
      adults, ages 18-40 years. Study procedures include blood samples and completing a memory aid&#xD;
      documenting daily oral temperature and side effects for 7 days following each vaccination.&#xD;
      Participants may be involved in the study for up to 13 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized, open-label, dose-ranging, phase I comparative trial of&#xD;
      intradermal (ID) and intramuscular (IM) injection with subvirion inactivated influenza A/H5N1&#xD;
      vaccine in healthy adults, 18 to 40 years old, inclusive. This study is designed to&#xD;
      investigate the safety, reactogenicity, and dose-related immunogenicity of an investigational&#xD;
      inactivated influenza A/H5N1 virus vaccine given by ID injection compared to IM injection.&#xD;
      The primary objectives of this study are to: compare dose-related safety and reactogenicity&#xD;
      profiles of ID and IM injection with subvirion inactivated influenza A/H5N1 vaccine among&#xD;
      healthy young adults; compare the dose-related immunogenicity of subvirion inactivated&#xD;
      influenza A/H5N1 vaccine given by ID with vaccine given by IM injection among healthy young&#xD;
      adults 1 month after receipt of the second dose of vaccine; and provide information for the&#xD;
      selection of the best dose levels for further studies. The secondary objectives of this study&#xD;
      are to: evaluate dose-related immunogenicity and the percent of subjects responding&#xD;
      approximately 1 and 7 months after the first vaccination; and evaluate the dose-related&#xD;
      safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity following receipt of a third dose of vaccine&#xD;
      administered 6-7 months after the second dose of vaccine. The study will have 2 comparison&#xD;
      arms (IM and ID), and 2 dosage levels will be evaluated in each arm (4 vaccine groups total).&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized 1:1:1:1 (25 subjects in each group) to receive 2 doses 1 month&#xD;
      apart of an inactivated influenza A/H5N1 vaccine containing 15 mcg or 45 mcg of H5 HA by the&#xD;
      IM route; or one-fifth of the IM dose (3 mcg or 9 mcg) by the ID route. Subjects will&#xD;
      maintain a memory aid recording oral temperature, and systemic and local adverse events for 7&#xD;
      days after each inoculation. Serum for immunogenicity evaluations will be obtained prior to&#xD;
      first vaccination, at Day 0, prior to second vaccination, at Day 28, and on Day 56 and&#xD;
      approximately Day 215 (7 months) after dose 1. This study is linked to DMID protocol 07-0022.&#xD;
