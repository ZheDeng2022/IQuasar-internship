      The natural thyroid hormones, thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3), are known to have a&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering effect. Their pharmacologic use for this purpose is limited, however, by&#xD;
      their actions on other organs, including the heart, bone, and brain, where there can be side&#xD;
      effects of excessive thyroid hormone action. 3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid (DITPA) is a&#xD;
      thyroid hormone analog with relative selectivity for a form of the thyroid hormone receptor&#xD;
      expressed in the liver, where it regulates several aspects of lipid metabolism, including the&#xD;
      clearance of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to determine whether DITPA is safe and effective in achieving LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol levels that are consistent with the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult&#xD;
      Treatment Panel III (NCEP ATP III) guidelines in patients who have not achieved those levels&#xD;
      on conventional therapy, due to drug-resistant disease, drug intolerance, or both.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Following a&#xD;
      4-week Pre-Randomization Phase with dietary counseling and a 2-week placebo run-in, eligible&#xD;
      patients will be randomized (1:1:1) to receive DITPA (90 mg/day, 180 mg/day), or placebo for&#xD;
      a total treatment duration of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty (60) patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (i.e., 20&#xD;
      patients per treatment group):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DITPA at 90 mg/day (45 mg twice a day [BID] taken orally)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DITPA at 180 mg/day (90 mg BID taken orally)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo (BID taken orally)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 90 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first&#xD;
      2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 180 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first&#xD;
      2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for the next 2 weeks, and then 180 mg/day for 8 weeks.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND: In recent years, the need to achieve increasingly ambitious therapeutic goals for&#xD;
      dyslipidemias has prompted the search for more potent pharmacological agents to lower&#xD;
      circulating atherogenic lipoprotein concentrations and enhance reverse cholesterol transport&#xD;
      (RCT). While mounting evidence supports the use of 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme&#xD;
      reductase inhibitors (or statins) as the main stay of therapy for patients requiring lipid&#xD;
      modification therapy, many patients remain under-treated or do not achieve the National&#xD;
      Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP) recommended goals.1-5 Recognizing new and emerging data,&#xD;
      NCEP III recently updated its guidelines to recognize the potential of a more aggressive low&#xD;
      density lipoprotein (LDL) goal of &lt;70 mg/dl in patients at high risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      events.3 The Treating to New Targets (TNT) study showed that even in patients with stable&#xD;
      coronary artery disease, a goal that is lower than currently recommended, &lt;80 mg/dl, may be&#xD;
      desirable in further reducing and/or preventing recurrent cardiovascular events.6 More than&#xD;
      40% of all Americans have LDL levels of 130 mg/dl or higher, and 13 million Americans have&#xD;
      coronary artery disease that may benefit from lipid modification therapy. In these&#xD;
      individuals, to achieve the optimal LDL goal and to treat other associated lipid&#xD;
      abnormalities, including low HDL cholesterol and/or high triglycerides, many patients will&#xD;
      likely require combination therapy.3, 7-13 Among the novel therapeutic agents investigated&#xD;
      have been selective thyroid hormone analogues. Such agents hold the promise of harnessing the&#xD;
      cholesterol-lowering properties of the naturally occurring thyroid hormones, triiodothyronine&#xD;
      (T3) and thyroxine (T4), but with greater receptor isoform and tissue specificity that should&#xD;
      result in an improved safety profile.14, 15 Unlike statins, thyroid hormones and their&#xD;
      analogues, in addition to cholesterol and LDL-lowering effects, may favorably lower&#xD;
      lipoprotein (a) (Lp(a)) and triglyceride levels.15-22 Also, because of potential thyroid&#xD;
      hormone-mediated genomic and non-genomic effects on the heart, certain populations, such as&#xD;
      those with congestive heart failure, may derive dual benefits from use of such thyromimetic&#xD;
      treatment.15, 22, 23 1.1.1 Effects of Thyroid Hormone on Lipid Metabolism Dyslipidemia has&#xD;
      long been associated with disorders of thyroid metabolism (i.e., hypothyroidism) and to be&#xD;
      potentially reversible by thyroid hormone therapy.17, 18, 21 Early autopsy series&#xD;
      demonstrated more severe atherosclerosis in individuals with premorbid hypothyroidism.24, 25&#xD;
      In studies of how thyroid hormone status affected radiolabeled lipoprotein kinetics, LDL was&#xD;
      found to be cleared less rapidly in hypothyroid animals and man.26 Subsequently, hepatic LDL&#xD;
      receptor number27 and mRNA expression28 were shown to be lower in hypothyroid animals. More&#xD;
      recently, characterization of the LDL receptor gene promoter has revealed the presence of&#xD;
      functionally important T3 regulatory elements.29 In addition to lowering total and LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol concentrations in treated hypothyroid patients, thyroid hormone therapy has been&#xD;
      shown in some studies to have a favorable impact on particularly atherogenic lipoproteins,&#xD;
      including Lp(a)30 and small dense and oxidizable LDL subfractions.31, 32 Finally, thyroid&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy has been shown to decrease apoB100 lipoprotein synthesis with a&#xD;
      resulting decrease in Very Low Density Lipoprotein (VLDL) production and hepatic triglyceride&#xD;
      production.33 There is now also considerable evidence that thyroid hormone receptor agonists&#xD;
      can directly or indirectly affect reverse cholesterol transport, the process by which&#xD;
      cholesterol is transported from peripheral cells, including cholesterol-laden endothelial&#xD;
      cells in the initial stage of atherosclerosis, to the liver for conversion to bile acids.&#xD;
      First, thyroid hormone affects the activity of apoA 1 lipoprotein,34 which plays several&#xD;
      critical roles in RCT-generating HDL that transports cholesterol from peripheral tissues to&#xD;
      the liver, as both the principal protein constituent of HDL and an activator of&#xD;
      lecithin-cholesterol acyltransferase (LCAT), which esterifies cholesterol on the surface of&#xD;
      pre-β-HDL. ApoA-I also stabilizes and increases the level of ATP-binding cassette A1 protein&#xD;
      (ABCA1), which, in turn, promotes efflux of cholesterol and phospholipids to nascent&#xD;
      HDL-particles. Thyroid hormone increases apoA-I gene expression in liver and intestine, in&#xD;
      part through a 5' flanking thyroid hormone response element.35, 36 Thyroid hormone has also&#xD;
      recently been shown to increased the scavenger class B type I receptor (SR-BI), another&#xD;
      regulator of serum HDL concentrations and cholesterol flux, in livers of mice treated with&#xD;
      either T3 or GC-1 (a thyroid hormone receptor modulator).37 Finally, thyroid hormones are&#xD;
      also known to increase activity of cholesterol 7α-hydroxylase (CYP-7A1)38 which catalyzes the&#xD;
      rate-limiting step in bile acid synthesis; in contrast, HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors have the&#xD;
      opposite effect. This thyroid hormone-induced increase in CYP-7A1 would be expected to&#xD;
      increase bile acid and cholesterol excretion, as has been observed in hyperthyroidism.39&#xD;
      1.1.2 Previous Clinical Research Previous studies have investigated the therapeutic potential&#xD;
      of thyromimetic compounds in lipid modification and heart failure.14,15,40 Early clinical&#xD;
      investigation focused on dextrothyroxine (D-T4), a D-isomer of thyroxine, which was thought&#xD;
      to have similar actions, but produce less tachycardia and myocardial oxygen consumption.40,&#xD;
      41 Although DT4 was commonly used as a cholesterol lowering drug in the 1970s,42 it is no&#xD;
      longer used in clinical practice. The therapeutic effects of DT4 were evaluated in the&#xD;
      Coronary Drug Project (CDP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Coronary Drug Project was initiated in 1965, primarily to answer the prevailing question&#xD;
      about the safety and efficacy of long term use of various cholesterol lowering agents in&#xD;
      patients with coronary artery disease. The Coronary Drug Project was a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled study, conducted between 1966 and 1975. It was designed to&#xD;
      evaluate the efficacy and safety of five lipid-modifying drugs in 8,341 men, with a history&#xD;
      of prior myocardial infarction (MI). Niacin, clofibrate, dextrothyroxine, and two estrogen&#xD;
      regimens were evaluated in the study along with a placebo arm.43, 44 DT4 was administered at&#xD;
      6.0 mg /day. The primary endpoint was overall mortality at 5 years. After a mean follow-up of&#xD;
      36 months, because of a nonsignificant trend toward higher mortality in the DT4 arm compared&#xD;
      with placebo, the DT4 arm was discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As acknowledged by the original investigators, the observed DT4-placebo difference in overall&#xD;
      mortality is not statistically significant as judged by the statistical methods utilized in&#xD;
      this study.44 Nevertheless, given the mortality trend and the low probability of eventual&#xD;
      benefits, a decision was made to discontinue the DT4 arm. In discontinuing the DT4 arm, the&#xD;
      study leadership recognized that the findings of the CDP left open the possibility that&#xD;
      dextrothyroxine may be efficacious for a limited group of carefully selected myocardial&#xD;
      infarction (MI) patients and for persons free of clinical CHD. 44 The net effect of DT4 on&#xD;
      serum lipids (the observed fall corrected for the concomitant rise for the placebo group) was&#xD;
      a sustained significant fall from baseline levels. The decrease was approximately 12% in&#xD;
      serum cholesterol levels and 15-20% in fasting serum triglyceride levels.44 Following the&#xD;
      study, it was revealed that the DT4 dispensed in the study contained less than 0.5% of&#xD;
      levothyroxine (approximately 30 µg of levothyroxine).44 Interestingly, it was later found&#xD;
      that contamination of levothyroxine commercial preparations varied from lot to lot (from 0.5%&#xD;
      to 2.3%).45 Also, this &quot;DT4&quot; formulation had other significant thyromimetic effects, leading&#xD;
      to TSH suppression that may have become clinically relevant with prolonged use.47 Suboptimal&#xD;
      dosing and thyrotoxic effects due to drug contamination may explain why more than 40% of the&#xD;
      DT4 patients required a dose reduction.44 1.1.3 DITPA DITPA (3,5-diiodothyropropionic acid)&#xD;
      is an analogue of naturally occurring thyroid hormone (T3) that has been specifically&#xD;
      designed to improve cardiac performance with a lower potential for tachycardia.22, 40, 46&#xD;
      DITPA binds to the same thyroid hormone receptors α and β as T3 but with less affinity.41 In&#xD;
      pre-clinical animal post-infarction models, DITPA improved calcium handling, promoted&#xD;
      angiogenesis, and attenuated abnormal left ventricular remodeling.47-53 In a rat model of&#xD;
      CHF, DITPA demonstrated increased cardiac output with increases in left ventricular dp/dt,&#xD;
      comparable to effects seen with T4, but with significantly less tachycardia. In addition,&#xD;
      there were increases in α-myosin heavy chain (MHC) RNA gene expression induced by DITPA&#xD;
      treatment.41 When evaluated in combination with captopril, DITPA improved both cardiac output&#xD;
      and dp/dt as well as increased the rate of LV relaxation when compared with captopril&#xD;
      alone.54 In a rabbit post-infarction model, DITPA decreased left ventricular end diastolic&#xD;
      pressure and increased positive and negative dp/dt without changes in heart rate or left&#xD;
      ventricular systolic pressure.43 In the same model, use of DITPA prevented abnormal SERCA&#xD;
      transport and abnormal contractile function associated with myocardial infarction.42, 44&#xD;
      Recently DITPA was also noted to improve endothelial function following myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, an action mediated through nitric oxide.55 The objective of the present study is&#xD;
      to evaluate the feasibility of DITPA, a thyroid hormone analogue, as a potential lipid&#xD;
      modification agent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      KNOWN AND POTENTIAL TOXICITIES: Since DITPA is a thyroid hormone analogue with thyromimetic&#xD;
      actions, safety and side effect profiles may be similar to those observed with thyroid&#xD;
      hormones T3 and T4 preparations (e.g., liothyronine and levothyroxine). Although excess&#xD;
      thyromimetic action is a theoretical side effect, it is also possible that tissue-specific&#xD;
      hypothyroidism might result if the drug fails to have sufficient thyromimetic activity in a&#xD;
      particular tissue. Due to pituitary effects of DITPA, a secondary lowering of TSH may result,&#xD;
      which in turn may lead to decreased endogenous production of T4. The potential effects of&#xD;
      such theoretical biochemical changes are unknown. Thus, DITPA safety will be diligently&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study through multiple examinations, symptom scales, and laboratory&#xD;
      evaluations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the known effects of thyrotoxicosis and hypothyroidism, and the side effects of T3&#xD;
      and T4 preparations, potential side effects of DITPA may include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Cardiovascular: palpitations, tachycardia, arrhythmias, increased pulse and blood&#xD;
           pressure, heart failure, angina, myocardial infarction, cardiac arrest&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Central nervous system: headache, hyperactivity, nervousness, anxiety, irritability,&#xD;
           emotional lability, insomnia&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dermatologic: hair loss, warm moist or dry skin, flushing&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Endocrine: decreased bone mineral density, gynecomastia&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Gastrointestinal: diarrhea or constipation, vomiting, abdominal cramps, elevations in&#xD;
           liver function tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. General symptoms: fatigue, increased appetite, excessive sweating&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Musculoskeletal: tremors, muscle weakness, proximal myopathy&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Respiratory: dyspnea&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Reproductive: menstrual irregularities, impaired fertility&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Metabolic: weight loss or gain, heat or cold temperature intolerance, fever Please&#xD;
           consult the most recent DITPA Investigator's Brochure (IB) including amendments for&#xD;
           additional information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, many drugs are known to affect thyroid hormone pharmacokinetics and metabolism&#xD;
      by altering absorption, synthesis, secretion, protein binding, and/or target tissue response,&#xD;
      and may also alter the therapeutic response to thyroid hormone preparations such as&#xD;
      levothyroxine. In addition, thyroid hormones and thyroid status may have varied effects on&#xD;
      the pharmacokinetics and actions of other drugs. A list of drug-thyroidal axis interactions&#xD;
      is provided in the prescribing information for marketed agents such as Synthroid®&#xD;
      (levothyroxine sodium tablets, USP), Abbott Laboratories and Cytomel® (liothyronine sodium&#xD;
      tablets), King Pharmaceuticals, Inc.&#xD;

      receive DITPA (90 mg/day, 180 mg/day), or Placebo for a total treatment duration of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sixty 60 patients will be randomized to 1 of 3 treatment groups in a 1:1:1 ratio (i.e., 20&#xD;
      patients per treatment group):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DITPA at 90 mg/day (45 mg BID taken orally)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  DITPA at 180 mg/day (90 mg BID taken orally)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 90 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first&#xD;
      2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for 10 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients randomized to receive DITPA at 180 mg/day will receive 45 mg/day for the first&#xD;
      2 weeks, followed by 90 mg/day for next 2 weeks, and then 180 mg/day for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Q1, Q2 = first and second qualifying LDL cholesterol values using Friedewald's calculation&#xD;

           UNSCHEDULED VISITS: Study patients should be evaluated and managed following best&#xD;
           medical practice with particular attention paid to patient safety, assessment of&#xD;
           potential treatment-related adverse events, and changes in clinical status.&#xD;
&#xD;
           EVALUATIONS: Study patients will be closely monitored throughout the study for safety&#xD;
           and clinical response. The results of all safety and efficacy evaluations must be&#xD;
           recorded in the CRF and in the source documents.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DESCRIPTION OF EVALUATIONS AND STUDY-SPECIFIC PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
           Informed Consent: Patients must give written informed consent, after the nature of the&#xD;
           study has been fully explained, in order to participate in this study. No study-specific&#xD;
           procedures may be performed before written informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Randomization of Patients: Patients who sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF), complete&#xD;
           all screening evaluations, pre-randomization (qualification) evaluations, and meet all&#xD;
           entry criteria, will be eligible for randomization, and enrollment into the study.&#xD;
           Randomization should occur within 2 days prior to study drug administration. All&#xD;
           patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 fashion to 1 of 3 treatment groups in order to&#xD;
           reduce selection bias. All randomization will be managed centrally, by the GCRC.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Medical and Medication History: A complete record of the patient's medical history,&#xD;
           other medical conditions, and concomitant medications (including current lipid&#xD;
           modification agents) will be obtained and recorded in the medical chart and CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Physical Examination, Vital Signs, and Weight: Patients will be seen by an Investigator&#xD;
           for a complete physical examination, vital signs (temperature, systolic and diastolic&#xD;
           blood pressure, pulse, and respiration rate), waist measurement and weight. Height will&#xD;
           be measured at baseline only. The eye examination, including a funduscopic exam and&#xD;
           measurement of visual acuity, will be conducted at the Baseline Visit and End of&#xD;
           Treatment Visit only.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Thyroid Symptom Assessment: Three clinical symptom scales (Hyperthyroid Symptom Scale,60&#xD;
           Modified Billewicz Index for Hypothyroidism,61, 62 and the Hypothyroid Symptom Scale)&#xD;
           will be used to assess and document potential thyroid-related symptoms. See attachment B&#xD;
           for details. The hypothyroid scale is a patient self-assessment and will be completed by&#xD;
           the patient at the beginning of the visit. The hyperthyroid scale and modified Billewicz&#xD;
           will be completed by the Investigator or designee. The same scales are currently in use&#xD;
           in the ongoing DITPA studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Echocardiogram: An echocardiogram will be performed at Baseline and Visit 8/End of&#xD;
           Treatment Visit for safety monitoring. The echocardiograms will be interpreted by a&#xD;
           designated study cardiologist for safety and efficacy, in a blinded fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Electrocardiogram (ECG): An electrocardiogram should be performed at the specified&#xD;
           visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
           DEXA Scan: Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, or DEXA scanning, will be used to measure&#xD;
           bone mineral density and body fat composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Laboratory Evaluations:&#xD;

           concentrations* Trough steady state levels of DITPA * Testing of samples for these&#xD;
           parameters may be performed at a later time, following initial efficacy analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Fasting: Patients will be instructed to fast at least 12 hours prior to Visits 1, 2, 3,&#xD;
           5, 6, 8, and 9 for the fasting lipid panel blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Blood draws for DITPA concentrations: Blood for DITPA concentrations will be drawn at&#xD;
           least 6 hours after the preceding dose of study drug. It is recommended that if the&#xD;
           patient has a morning appointment, the patient should not take the morning dose until&#xD;
           after the blood draw. If the patient has an afternoon appointment, the patient should&#xD;
           take the morning dose as usual. The time of the preceding dose should be recorded in&#xD;
           source documents and the CRF.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Females must not be pregnant or lactating. Females of childbearing potential and males&#xD;
             must use a reliable means of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. LDL-C level greater than the NCEP goals, as determined by patients' risk category&#xD;
             according to NCEP ATP III criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Risk category for coronary heart disease and coronary heart disease equivalent with&#xD;
             LDL goal of &lt; 100 mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Baseline lipid criteria: LDL-C = 100 to160 mg/dL and triglyceride level = 100 to 500&#xD;
             mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Normal thyroid function tests (total T3, total T4, and thyroid-stimulating hormone&#xD;
             [TSH])&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Hemoglobin A1C &lt; 8.5% on a stable oral hypoglycemic or insulin regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. On stable lipid modification pharmacotherapy (including a statin) for at least 2 weeks&#xD;
             prior to study entry. Patients must be on at least half of the maximal doses of&#xD;
             statins (as assessed by the Investigator), or be intolerant to statins such that the&#xD;
             doses are not achievable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Able to give informed consent&#xD;

          1. History of thyroid disorders of any form within 24 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Active liver disease and/or liver transaminases greater than 1.5 X upper limit of&#xD;
             normal&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Active myocarditis, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, uncorrected primary valvular disease,&#xD;
             restrictive cardiomyopathy, uncorrected congenital heart disease, or constrictive&#xD;
             pericarditis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Myocardial infarction, unstable ischemic heart disease, stroke, or coronary&#xD;
             revascularization procedure within 24 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Moderate or severe symptomatic congestive heart failure (New York Heart Association&#xD;
             class III and IV)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Drug or alcohol dependence, or other conditions which may affect study compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Renal insufficiency (serum creatinine &gt; 2 mg/dL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects taking other hormonal therapies (other than oral contraceptive agents and&#xD;
             postmenopausal hormone replacement therapy) e.g., glucocorticoids, androgens, or&#xD;
             growth hormones&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Use of thyroid supplements (levothyroxine, liothyronine, etc.) or any preparation&#xD;
             containing thyromimetic agents within 24 weeks prior to study entry&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. History of coagulopathy or use of anticoagulants such as warfarin&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Unstable endocrine/metabolic syndrome that may affect lipid metabolism&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. History of atrial or ventricular arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Diagnosis of other non-cardiac underlying medical conditions expected to impact&#xD;
             mortality within 24 weeks after randomization&#xD;
