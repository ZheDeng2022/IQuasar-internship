    <textblock>
      This study will use a technique called microperfusion to examine how thyroid hormones are&#xD;
      involved in fat metabolism. The thyroid gland produces two kinds of hormones: T3 and T4. Some&#xD;
      of the T4 is changed to T3 in various organs after leaving the thyroid. The T3 stimulates the&#xD;
      body to burn fat. People have different rates at which they can change T4 to T3, and this may&#xD;
      lead to differences in body fat among different people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microperfusion is based on the exchange of substances across tiny holes of a small plastic&#xD;
      tube called a &quot;probe,&quot; which is inserted after numbing the skin over a fat pad. Through these&#xD;
      openings, the fat pad is continuously rinsed with small amounts of fluid, and an exchange of&#xD;
      substances occurs. The fluid drips from the other opening of the probe and is collected in a&#xD;
      vial. Small amounts of study drugs are infused and the amount of substances released by the&#xD;
      fat pad in response to them are measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study.&#xD;
      Candidates are screened with a medical history, physical examination and blood tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants undergo microperfusion. A needle is placed in an arm vein for collecting blood&#xD;
      samples before and at the end of the experiment for measuring thyroid hormones and other&#xD;
      substances in the blood. The skin over the fat pad next to the umbilicus (navel) is numbed&#xD;
      and two microperfusion probes are inserted. A salt water solution is infused into the fat pad&#xD;
      for one hour and the substances in the fluid are measured as the fluid leaves the fat pad.&#xD;
      After 1 hour isoproterenol, a drug that aids in energy production by fat, is added to help&#xD;
      determine the level of fat metabolism. After an additional hour small amounts of thyroid&#xD;
      hormone are added to the fluid and samples are collected as they leave the body. Two&#xD;
      catheters are inserted during each experiment. Small volumes of sterile fluid are circulated&#xD;
      continuously in the tubing and samples are collected at regular intervals.&#xD;

      This study will examine how two thyroid preparations, levothyroxine (T4) and liothyronine&#xD;
      (T3), affect subcutaneous adipose tissue in normal subjects. Thyroid hormone plays an&#xD;
      important role in the maintenance of energy metabolism. Specifically, hyperthyroidism is&#xD;
      associated with weight loss via an increase in metabolic rate and lipolysis. While this&#xD;
      phenomenon has been studied in vitro quite extensively, very little information is available&#xD;
      on the local action of thyroid hormone on adipose tissue in vivo and, in particular, at the&#xD;
      present no information is available on the role of peripheral conversion of thyroid hormone&#xD;
      in subcutaneous adipose tissue. We thus propose to study the local action of thyroid hormones&#xD;
      on adipose tissue using microdialysis, a minimally invasive technique that allows the serial&#xD;
      determination of components of the extracellular fluid. The measurement of glycerol after&#xD;
      correction for changes in blood flow will be used to evaluate the effects of the thyroid&#xD;
      hormones on local lipolysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers 18 years of age and older may be eligible for this study. Candidates are&#xD;
      screened with a medical history, physical examination, and blood tests. Subjects with&#xD;
      hyperlipidemia, impaired glucose tolerance or diabetes and thyroid disease are not eligible&#xD;
      for the participation in this study. Qualifying study participants undergo subcutaneous fat&#xD;
      tissue microdialysis to assess the effects of T3 and T4 on the activity of fat tissue. The&#xD;
      medications isoproterenol and T3 or T4 are injected in fat tissue under the skin of the&#xD;
      abdomen, and fluid samples are collected from the area over a 6-12 hour period using the same&#xD;
      small needle. Glycerol is then measured to study how the thyroid hormones affect fat&#xD;
      metabolism. During this procedure a 10% glucose solution is infused through the catheter in&#xD;
      the arm to limit lipolysis due to fasting. Four different sets of experiments are performed&#xD;
      with different thyroid hormone doses and/or durations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These experiments will provide new information on the role of thyroid hormone in the&#xD;
      regulation of adipose tissue metabolism and will help in identifying new treatments for the&#xD;
      management of obesity.&#xD;
