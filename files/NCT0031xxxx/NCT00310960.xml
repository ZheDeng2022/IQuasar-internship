  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To estimate the duration of misalignment by age at presentation in infantile esotropia&#xD;
           (infantile ET), acquired non-accommodative esotropia (ANAET) and acquired partially&#xD;
           accommodative esotropia (APAET).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the proportion of patients with angle instability in infantile ET, ANAET&#xD;
           and APAET by length of follow-up.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately one third of infants with infantile esotropia (infantile ET) and a similar&#xD;
      proportion of children with acquired non-accommodative esotropia (ANAET) will have an&#xD;
      increasing angle within the first few months of their initial examination. In approximately&#xD;
      two thirds of patients, the angle of misalignment remains stable and in a small proportion,&#xD;
      the angle of esotropia decreases. The changing angle of misalignment in a significant&#xD;
      proportion of children with esotropia raises an important question regarding the timing of&#xD;
      surgical management of these children: should surgery be undertaken immediately or delayed&#xD;
      until the alignment stabilizes? Early surgery may improve sensory outcomes; delayed surgery&#xD;
      may improve surgical dosing accuracy and motor outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with acquired partially accommodative esotropia (APAET) may differ from those with&#xD;
      infantile ET and ANAET in that they tend to present at an older age, are more likely to&#xD;
      preserve high-grade stereopsis with appropriate treatment, require surgical intervention less&#xD;
      frequently, and have more substantial hyperopic refractive errors. Little is known regarding&#xD;
      early angle stability in this group of patients following correction of their refractive&#xD;
      errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is a need for a randomized trial to address the issue of timing of surgery in&#xD;
      infantile ET, APAET, and ANAET, prior to designing such a trial, high-quality preliminary&#xD;
      data are needed. We propose a multi-center observational study to 1) determine the duration&#xD;
      of misalignment in infantile ET, ANAET, and APAET at study enrollment, 2) to prospectively&#xD;
      establish the proportion of patients with angle instability in infantile ET, ANAET, and&#xD;
      APAET, and 3) to determine recruitment potential for a randomized trial. These data will be&#xD;
      crucial for sample size calculations for the eventual randomized trial, and will help further&#xD;
      define the clinical characteristics of these conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A concurrent and nested ancillary study will be conducted at selected centers to collect&#xD;
      test-retest data on alignment measurements for estimating the amount of measurement&#xD;
      variability. These test-retest data will be used to define a change in angle alignment that&#xD;
      exceeds an amount which could reasonably be due to measurement error, which will be used in&#xD;
      evaluating the proportion of patients with angle instability in the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients with infantile ET will be consented and enrolled at their initial visit.&#xD;
      Infantile ET patients who need spectacles will be prescribed spectacles and will return for&#xD;
      an Infantile ET Spectacle Baseline Visit 2 weeks later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ANAET and APAET patients who present wearing spectacles with appropriate correction for at&#xD;
      least 2 weeks will be consented and enrolled into the study at that initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ANAET and APAET patients who present not wearing spectacles:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who do not need spectacles will be consented and enrolled into the study at&#xD;
           that initial visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who need spectacles are prescribed appropriate correction if the investigator&#xD;
           intends to offer the patient enrollment at a later date. Patients are asked to return&#xD;
           after wearing the new spectacles 2-6 weeks, at which time they may be consented and&#xD;
           enrolled into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The study will enroll 100 patients for each of the three esotropia types of&#xD;
      infantile ET, ANAET, and APAET, for a total of 300 patients.&#xD;
