  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor is a class of drug that interferes with the function&#xD;
      of HDAC, an enzyme that hides HIV within inactive CD4 cells. These drugs are normally used to&#xD;
      treat seizures and other nervous system problems but have been found to work against HIV. The&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of valproic acid (VPA), an HDAC&#xD;
      inhibitor, in treating HIV infected adults using anti-HIV drugs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      VPA is a type of medication normally used to treat seizures and other nervous system&#xD;
      problems. It has been found that VPA works against HIV by releasing the virus from resting&#xD;
      CD4 cells, allowing other anti-HIV medications to attack it. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      assess the efficacy of VPA when used in HIV infected participants using highly active&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy (HAART). The expected duration of participation for individually&#xD;
      enrolled participants will depend on which study group the participant is placed in but may&#xD;
      range from approximately 24 to 144 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An initial screening visit will occur about 30 to 120 days prior to study entry. A physical&#xD;
      exam, medical and medication history assessment, and blood and urine collection will occur at&#xD;
      screening. Leukapheresis and genital secretion collection will occur once 30 to 120 days&#xD;
      prior to study entry, separate from the initial screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 1, all participants will receive VPA while continuing their current HAART. Doses of&#xD;
      VPA will vary by participant. Study visits will occur on Days 0 and 3 and Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8,&#xD;
      12, 16, and 24. A physical exam and blood and urine collection will occur at most visits.&#xD;
      Leukapheresis and genital secretion collection will occur at study entry and Weeks 12 and 16.&#xD;
      After 24 weeks, participants will enter Step 2. Those participants not responding to VPA in&#xD;
      Step 1 will enroll in Step 2A. Participants responding to VPA in Step 1 will enroll in Step&#xD;
      2B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 2A, participants will discontinue VPA and will receive intensified therapy&#xD;
      (enfuvirtide) administered for 24 weeks twice daily. Study visits will occur at Weeks 25, 28,&#xD;
      32, 36, 40, and 48. A physical exam and blood and urine collection will occur at all visits.&#xD;
      Leukapheresis will occur at Weeks 36 and 40. Participants who do not respond to intensified&#xD;
      therapy in Step 2A will enroll in Step 3A. Participants who respond to intensified therapy in&#xD;
      Step 2A will enroll in Step 3B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 2B, participants will continue to receive VPA for up to 96 weeks. Study visits will&#xD;
      occur every 8 weeks until Week 120. A physical exam and blood and urine collection will occur&#xD;
      at each visit. Leukapheresis will occur once between Week 72 and Week 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 3A, VPA will be added to enfuvirtide for 16 weeks. The study will be discontinued for&#xD;
      participants who do not respond. Study visits will occur at screening, entry, Day 0, and&#xD;
      Weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, and 22. A physical exam and blood and urine collection will occur&#xD;
      at all visits. Leukapheresis will occur after screening, at entry, Day 0 and Weeks 12 and 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Step 3B, participants may continue receiving enfuvirtide for up to 96 weeks. Study visits&#xD;
      will occur every 8 weeks until Week 144. A physical exam and blood and urine collection will&#xD;
      occur at each visit. Leukapheresis will occur at Week 96 or 144.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may choose to enter an observational period at any time before they start Step 2&#xD;
      or Step 3. During the observational period, participants continue to take HAART but not VPA&#xD;
      or enfuvirtide. Upon entering an observational period, study staff will contact the&#xD;
      participant every 8 weeks for a review of their medical records. Each participant will have a&#xD;
      study visit within 8 weeks of beginning a new step. These interim study screenings include a&#xD;
      physical exam, medical history, and blood and urine collection. Participants may be asked to&#xD;
      have additional leukapheresis performed if they have discontinued study medications for 12&#xD;
      weeks or more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each leukapheresis procedure will take place at the University of North Carolina Apheresis&#xD;
      Clinic in Chapel Hill, North Carolina. This study will not provide participants' current&#xD;
      HAART regimen medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: As of 05/20/08, the observational period and Steps 1, 2, 2A, 2B, and 3B were&#xD;
      discontinued.&#xD;
