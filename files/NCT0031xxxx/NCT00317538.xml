  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis who have had an incomplete&#xD;
      response to etanercept and methotrexate (MTX), are to evaluate: safety and evidence of&#xD;
      therapeutic benefit of infliximab and methotrexate, the levels (pharmacokinetics) of&#xD;
      etanercept and infliximab and antibodies (immunogenicity) to etanercept and infliximab in&#xD;
      patients blood, whether switching from etanercept to infliximab changes progression of&#xD;
      structural damage over the study period, and whether specific markers in the blood&#xD;
      (pharmacodynamics) correlate with therapeutic response or benefit.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Therapeutic agents designed to bind and block the biological activities of tumor necrosis&#xD;
      factor-alpha (TNFa) have been shown to be effective in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis&#xD;
      (RA). Two anti-TNFa agents are currently marketed for the treatment of RA; etanercept&#xD;
      (Enbrel®) and infliximab (REMICADE®). Clinical trials have shown that both of these agents&#xD;
      rapidly improve signs and symptoms associated with RA in the majority of patients. Moreover,&#xD;
      they slow, and may even arrest or improve, the joint structural damage that accompanies RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While infliximab and etanercept are designed to block the biological activities of TNFa,&#xD;
      these agents are sufficiently different in their structure that they may have distinct, as&#xD;
      well as overlapping, mechanisms of action. The clearest evidence of this possibility can be&#xD;
      inferred from their differential activities in certain diseases such as Crohn's disease in&#xD;
      which infliximab, but not etanercept, shows beneficial therapeutic activity. The mechanism of&#xD;
      their differential biological activities is not known. That infliximab and etanercept show&#xD;
      differential activities in other diseases suggests that they may also have distinct effects&#xD;
      in RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The question of whether or not patients who fail to respond to or incompletely respond to&#xD;
      etanercept can still respond to infliximab has potentially important therapeutic&#xD;
      implications. Evidence that such patients respond to infliximab could support the notion that&#xD;
      these agents have important differences in their mechanisms of action, or could be explained&#xD;
      by the presence of antibodies to etanercept. More importantly, it would suggest that&#xD;
      therapeutic failure of one TNFa-blocker does not necessarily predict failure of all&#xD;
      TNFa-targeting agents. Such a finding could open important therapeutic alternatives to RA&#xD;
      patients and is of clear importance because this class of biologics (biologic agent)&#xD;
      represents the most significant advance to date in the treatment of RA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This initial open-label, pilot study will be performed in approximately 24 patients with RA&#xD;
      who have who have achieved some therapeutic benefit from treatment with concomitant&#xD;
      etanercept and MTX for a minimum of 3 months, but the response must be an incomplete&#xD;
      response, and patients must have a minimum of 9 tender and 6 swollen joints while receiving&#xD;
      concomitant etanercept and MTX. It will assess safety and evidence of therapeutic benefit of&#xD;
      infliximab in this patient population. The study will examine any differences in the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and immunogenicity of etanercept and infliximab in patients who are&#xD;
      incomplete responders to etanercept.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an open-label, exploratory study and no formal hypothesis is being tested. This study&#xD;
      will provide a preliminary assessment of safety and evidence of therapeutic benefit of&#xD;
      infliximab plus MTX in patients with RA who are incomplete responders to etanercept plus MTX.&#xD;
      One group will receive intravenous infliximab infusions at a dose of 3 mg/kg at weeks 0, 2, 6&#xD;
      14 and 22. The second group will receive etanercept injections, 25 mg subcutaneously twice&#xD;
      weekly from week 0 through 16 and may receive intravenous infliximab infusions at 3 mg/kg on&#xD;
      weeks 16, 18 &amp; 22.&#xD;
