      This study will examine whether continuous use of transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      (tDCS) in combination with motor training can lead to long-term improvement in movement&#xD;
      performance beyond what can be achieved with motor training alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy normal volunteers 18-80 years of age who are clearly right- or left-handed may be&#xD;
      eligible for this study. Each candidate is screened with a medical history, clinical and&#xD;
      neurological examination, questionnaires to evaluate memory, attention, and handedness and a&#xD;
      brain MRI, if one has not been done by NINDS within 12 months of entering the study. Pregnant&#xD;
      women may not participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves 10 sessions (in addition to the screening visit) over 3 months. Sessions&#xD;
      1-5 are completed over 5 consecutive days. Sessions 6-10 are divided over the remaining time.&#xD;
      Participants are randomly assigned to one of three groups: 1) tDCS during motor training; 2)&#xD;
      tDCS after training; or 3) training with sham tDCS. During these sessions, participants&#xD;
      perform a pinch force task (squeezing a small device between the thumb and forefinger) and&#xD;
      visuomotor tasks (using a device to move the cursor on a computer screen to various targets&#xD;
      and holding the cursor in place for 1 second).&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the motor training and performance sessions, participants have the following&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TMS measurements: A wire coil is held on the scalp, and a brief electrical current is&#xD;
           passed through the coil, creating a magnetic pulse that stimulates the brain. During the&#xD;
           stimulation, the subject may be asked to tense certain muscles slightly or perform other&#xD;
           simple actions. The stimulation may cause a twitch in muscles of the face, arm, or leg,&#xD;
           and the subject may hear a click and feel a pulling sensation on the skin under the&#xD;
           coil.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  tDCS: Small, wet sponge electrodes are applied to the head - one above the eye and the&#xD;
           other on the back of the head. A small electrical current is passed between them. The&#xD;
           subject may feel an itching or tingling sensation under the electrodes or see light&#xD;
           flashes. Some sessions are done with sham tDCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surface electromyography: Electrodes are filled with a conductive gel and taped to the&#xD;
           skin over one small hand muscle to measure the electrical activity of muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Behavioral measurements: Evaluation of learned movement tasks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires to evaluate the subject's attention, fatigue and mood before and after&#xD;
           testing&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor practice and use over one session leads to use-dependent plasticity. When practice is&#xD;
      repeated over multiple sessions, motor performance continues improving until a plateau in&#xD;
      performance, the so-called ceiling effect is reached. This issue is particularly important in&#xD;
      neurorehabilitative treatments in which patients usually reach a ceiling effect without&#xD;
      further improvement. Thus, it would be desirable to modify ceiling effects in motor&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The purpose of this protocol is to determine if repeated applications of&#xD;
      TDCS, a form of non-invasive cortical stimulation known to transiently improve performance,&#xD;
      in association with training, could elicit additional improvements in motor performance&#xD;
      beyond the ceiling effect identified during performance of a visuomotor training task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypothesis that anodal TDCS applied over M1 in temporal relation with motor&#xD;
      training will lead to more prominent long-term learning of a visuomotor task relative to sham&#xD;
      stimulation (which would document the ceiling effect) in healthy individuals and chronic&#xD;
      stroke patients and traumatic brain injury (TB1) patients..&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY POPULATION:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We plan to study 177 healthy volunteers (part 1) and 60 chronic stroke patients (part 2) and&#xD;
      50 TB1 patients with 50 additional healthy volunteers (part 3). Therefore, an overall&#xD;
      enrollment of 337 participants is planned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will follow a parallel design. Healthy volunteers (part 1) and stroke patients&#xD;
      (part 2)will be randomly allocated to one of three groups. Each group will receive anodal&#xD;
      TDCS or sham in a fixed time frame related to motor training (during or immediately after&#xD;
      motor training). TB1 patients and healthy volunteers (part 3) will be randomly allocated to&#xD;
      one of two groups. Each group will receive either sham or anodal tDCS during training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthy volunteers and stroke patients will participate in 10 sessions. First, they will&#xD;
      train a visuomotor task (VMT) on 5 consecutive days while receiving sham stimulation (group&#xD;
      3) or TDCS during (group 1), or immediately after (group 2) the training. Performance of the&#xD;
      VMT will be re-evaluated at 30, 60 and 90 days after the first training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traumatic brain injury (TB1) patients and a group of healthy volunteers (part 3) will&#xD;
      participate in 6 sessions. First, they will train a visumomotor task (VMT) on 3 consecutive&#xD;
      days while receiving anodal tDCS or sham stimulation during the training. Performance of the&#xD;
      VMT will be re-evaluated at 30, 60, and 90 days after the first training session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome measure will be the percentage change (from baseline to day 8 in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers and stroke patients, and from baseline to day 3 in traumatic brain injury) in the&#xD;
      total time necessary to complete 15 correct trials of the visuomotor task.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome will be accuracy (no. of errors) and timing (speed) variability of force&#xD;
      adaptation in the visuomotor task (Celnik, own data), and pinch force at all other time&#xD;
      points, including day 5 as a measure of learning over the training period and 3 months as a&#xD;
      measure for long-term retention. In the patient group the Jebsen Taylor Test will be used to&#xD;
      assess gross motor function. To better understand the mechanisms underlying the proposed&#xD;
      behavioral gains, we will use single- and paired pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation&#xD;
      (TMS) to identify corticomotor excitability changes. Furthermore the volunteers will answer&#xD;
      several questionnaires to evaluate fatigue and mood (PANAS) and perform short&#xD;
      neuropsychological control task to control for changes in attention and memory function.&#xD;
