      This is a single center, independent study. The primary objective is to compare efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of continuing a conventional HAART in chronically infected HIV patients with a&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy based on long term, immunologically driven treatment interruptions.&#xD;
      Evaluation will be based on clinical, immunological and virological response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in a ratio 1:2 to one of the two treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group continuing the ongoing therapy STI group performing long term CD4 guided&#xD;
      structured treatment interruptions In the STI arm patients will stay off therapy until their&#xD;
      CD4 count will drop &lt; 400 cells/mcL. At that time point patients will resume the HAART&#xD;
      regimen they were assuming before STI and will continue HAART until they CD4 count will raise&#xD;
      &gt; 800 cells/mcL and their HIV-RNA will drop below the detection limit of 50 copies/ml. When&#xD;
      both the CD4 count and the viral load will be within these pre-set values they will stop&#xD;
      therapy again. There is no limit to the number of interruptions and re-start cycles during&#xD;
      the study period The study is powered to evaluate equivalence between the two strategies&#xD;
      under the assumption of a failure proportion in the control arm at each time point not&#xD;
      greater than 5% and a maximum allowed difference of 15%.&#xD;

      Study objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare efficacy (clinical and immunological) and safety of continuing a conventional&#xD;
      HAART in chronically infected HIV patients with a therapeutic strategy based on long term,&#xD;
      immunologically driven treatment interruptions. To verify the risk of developing viral&#xD;
      resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To verify the effect of the two strategies on metabolic parameters To verify the possibility&#xD;
      to steadily discontinue antiretroviral therapy in patients that started it with baseline&#xD;
      immunological values higher than those currently recommended by international guidelines for&#xD;
      HIV treatment To identify predictive variables of the possibility to safely discontinue&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy To verify the dynamic of CD4 + loss and HIV replication after&#xD;
      treatment interruption To verify costs connected to the strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      a. Inclusion i. Age &gt; 17 years ii. Informed consent signed iii. Effective ongoing treatment&#xD;
      (HIV-RNA &lt; 50 copies/ml). Treatment must be based on any triple drug therapy. Patients must&#xD;
      be on the same steady therapy for at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Current CD4 cell count above 800 cells/mcL b. Exclusion i. Childbearing or breastfeeding.&#xD;
      Women of childbearing potential will be asked to adopt effective contraceptive methods or&#xD;
      behaviors ii. Any ongoing grade 4 (WHO) AE or laboratory abnormality with the exclusion of&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglycerides for which a grade 3 (AHA) level will be considered an exclusion&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the study wants to enroll patients strictly reflecting the population of HIV infected&#xD;
      individuals, previous mono or dual therapies as well as the presence of co-morbidities such&#xD;
      as HBV and HCV co-infection do not constitute exclusion criteria, but will be recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, controlled, open, comparative study. The trial will have a follow-up of&#xD;
      4 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored according to the international and local guidelines for HIV&#xD;
      infection as far as timing and type of laboratory and clinical controls. Laboratory exams&#xD;
      will be decided locally and only a few key tests are required for the study. The timing of&#xD;
      laboratory evaluation will be 1 and 2 months after each treatment interruption and thereafter&#xD;
      every 2 months. All data will be stored in a computerized data-base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arms and management of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in the ratio 1: 2 to one of the following treatment arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Continuing their ongoing HAART (control)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Long term treatment interruption (STI) Randomization will be accomplished locally&#xD;
           according to a pre-determined, computer-generated random list.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, patients will be allowed to change therapy for virological,&#xD;
      toxicological or personal reasons as well as to comply with new indications from&#xD;
      international guidelines. All variation will be recorded. Patients changing therapy will be&#xD;
      still included in the ITT analysis, but will be considered failures in the AT analysis.&#xD;
      Patients stopping therapy, for any reason and not resuming it within 3 months will be&#xD;
      considered as failures for both the AT analysis In the STI arm, patients will stay off&#xD;
      therapy until their CD4 count drop &lt; 400 cells/mcL (one measurement will be considered&#xD;
      sufficient). At that time point patients will resume the HAART regimen they were assuming&#xD;
      before the STI period (unless judged as no more of choice according to new international&#xD;
      guidelines) and will continue HAART until their CD4 count raises &gt; 800 cells/mcL and their&#xD;
      plasma HIV-RNA drops below the detection limit of 50 copies/ml (one measurement will be&#xD;
      considered sufficient). When both the CD4 count and the viral load will be within these&#xD;
      pre-set values they will stop therapy again. There is no limit to the number of interruptions&#xD;
      and re-start cycles during the study period 100 patients will be allocated in the STI arm and&#xD;
      30 patients in the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points and evaluation criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary end-points for the evaluation of the main objective of the study can be divided&#xD;
      in short term end points and long term end points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary short term outcome measure will be the proportion of subjects maintaining at each&#xD;
      time-point (every 4 months) a CD4 + cell count above 400 cells/mcL. The trial power is&#xD;
      calculated on this end point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the long term, the primary outcome measure will be based on the occurrence of clinical&#xD;
      end-points including: disease progression defined as the occurrence of any AIDS defining&#xD;
      event and death. The occurrence of grade 4 (WHO) adverse events limiting the possibility to&#xD;
      maintain the patient in the randomized arm will also be considered in AT analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Virologic failure with the selection of resistance conferring mutations is the second&#xD;
      long-term primary end-point. Genotypic tests will be performed in the case of HIV-RNA &gt; 1000&#xD;
      copies/ml while on therapy for at least 6 months (in either group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study will be evaluated on the basis of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean variation of blood cholesterol and triglycerides from baseline values. For these&#xD;
      parameters the proportion of subjects with a value above grade 2 (AHA) will be also used as&#xD;
      evaluation criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Development of lipodystrophy or modification of a pre-existing lipodystrophy Time off therapy&#xD;
      Economic evaluation Genotypic tests to be performed in the case of HIV-RNA &gt; 1000 copies/ml&#xD;
      while on therapy for at least 4 months or one month after each treatment interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be continued for 4 years under the study conditions. Patients completing the&#xD;
      study period and still responding to therapy will be kept on the same regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical evaluation of the study will be performed yearly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory tests during the study period will be performed in he fasting state. The following&#xD;
      tests and procedures are required and will be recorded in the electronic data base. It is&#xD;
      also advised to perform on regular basis haemogram, renal function tests, blood glucose and&#xD;
      amylase. Other test could be performed according to local needs or particular situations&#xD;
      related to the specific management of single patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline (all patients) i. Informed consent and treatment randomization ii. Biochemical&#xD;
      analysis: ALT, AST, total cholesterol and HDL, triglycerides iii. CD4 count, CD8 count iv.&#xD;
      Plasma HIV-RNA v. Clinical evaluation, anamnestic and demographic data: sex, age, risk factor&#xD;
      for HIV infection, CDC AIDS classification, time on ART, time on current HAART, previous&#xD;
      antiretroviral drugs, previous sub-optimal ARTs, current antiretroviral drugs, presence and&#xD;
      grade of lipodystrophy, time with HIV-RNA below detection, nadir CD4, CD4 at start of&#xD;
      antiretroviral therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. month after each STI (only STI group) i. CD4 count, CD8 count, HIV-RNA&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. months after each STI (only STI group) i. Biochemical analysis: ALT, AST, cholesterol&#xD;
           (total and HDL), triglycerides ii. CD4 count, CD8 count iii. Plasma HIV-RNA, Genotype&#xD;
           iv. Clinical evaluation: disease progression, lipodystrophy assessment Every 2 months&#xD;
           thereafter (STI group and control group) i. Biochemical analysis: ALT, AST, cholesterol&#xD;
           (total and HDL), triglycerides ii. CD4 count, CD8 count iii. Plasma HIV-RNA iv. Clinical&#xD;
           evaluation: disease progression, lipodystrophy assessment Additional tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional tests will be requested in specific cases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      i. a second genotype after 4 months from the initiation of the STI period will be performed&#xD;
      in all patients showing a major mutation in the genotype performed 2 months after STI start&#xD;
      ii. a genotype will be performed in all patients either in the STI or in the control group&#xD;
      showing a viral load above 1000 copies/ml after a continuous treatment period (on drugs) &gt; 5&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is powered to evaluate equivalence between the two strategies under the assumption&#xD;
      of a failure proportion in the control arm at each time point not greater than 5% and a&#xD;
      maximum allowed difference of 15%. Equivalence will be defined on the basis of the 95%&#xD;
      confidence interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to this hypothesis with alfa = 5% and 1-beta = 80% a minimum of 70 patients will be&#xD;
      needed. The primary analysis will be made according to the intention-to-treat approach and&#xD;
      therefore no correction for eventual drop outs is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a secondary per-protocol analysis will be performed. The primary outcome measure&#xD;
      (the proportion of patients with CD4 + cell counts above 400 cells/mcL) will be analyzed by&#xD;
      means of Chi-square or Fisher's exact test that will be used to analyze all other categorical&#xD;
      variables, too. Time to treatment failure will be estimated using Kaplan-Meier product-limit&#xD;
      estimates (that will be presented graphically). The log-rank test will be used to assess the&#xD;
      difference between the survival curves for each arm, while ANOVA test and Student's t test&#xD;
      will be used for continuous variables unless the variables will not be normally distributed,&#xD;
      in which case the Mann-Whitney U tests will be used. Logistic regression analyses (forward&#xD;
      stepwise model) will be used to evaluate the relationship between variables and outcome.&#xD;
      Comparisons between pairs of groups will bee performed only in the case of a multiple test&#xD;
      yielding a statistically significant result.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be two-sided and a P value inferior to 0.05 will be regarded as significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis of data will be performed by the proposing Study Center with the SPSS&#xD;
      statistical software package for Windows, version 10.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a spontaneous study. It is proposed that all drugs will be dispensed according to&#xD;
      standard procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data use&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be used for scientific purposes only. The analysis will be performed yearly. The&#xD;
      type and timing of publication of data will be agreed among the participants to the study.&#xD;
      The authorship of each presentation will be agreed among participants. All participants will&#xD;
      be acknowledged as members of the study group.&#xD;
