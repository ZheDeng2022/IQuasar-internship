      This trial is designed to assess the tolerability and efficacy of simvastatin plus FOLFIRI&#xD;
      (irinotecan, 5-FU, leucovorin) in metastatic colorectal cancer patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progress in treatment for metastatic CRC has undoubtedly been achieved in the past decade.&#xD;
      Until 1985, 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) was the only agent available for the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic CRC. Several trials have attempted to enhance the activity of bolus 5-FU, by the&#xD;
      addition of levamisole or interferon. Despite of these attempts, no survival advantage was&#xD;
      established until the introduction of the newer cytotoxic drugs. The addition of folinic acid&#xD;
      (FA) to 5-FU, the use of infusional rather than bolus 5-FU, and the combination of new active&#xD;
      agents such as irinotecan and oxaliplatin with 5-FU/FA have resulted in an increase in&#xD;
      activity of 5-FU. In trials of current combination regimens as first-line therapy, response&#xD;
      rates exceeding 30% and median survival duration longer than 16 months have been reported. In&#xD;
      all, despite of rapid advances in the treatment of metastatic CRC during the last decade, the&#xD;
      efficacy of treatment still needs to be improved. One potential way of increasing the&#xD;
      survival of metastatic CRC patients is the introduction of a novel targeting agent to the&#xD;
      standard cytotoxic regimen such as IFL (irinotecan, fluorouracil, and leucovorin). An&#xD;
      increasingly recognized molecular target for anticancer treatment is the rate-limiting enzyme&#xD;
      of the mevalonate pathway, 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. The end&#xD;
      products of the mevalonate pathway are required for a number of essential cellular functions&#xD;
      such as sterols for membrane integrity, ubiquinone for cell respiration, geranylgeranyl&#xD;
      isoprenoids for covalent bindings to the ras family, dolichol for glycoprotein synthesis, and&#xD;
      isopentenyladenine for tRNA function and protein synthesis. Fortunately, inhibitors of the&#xD;
      key enzyme, the statins, are well established and have been used safely in the clinic for the&#xD;
      treatment of hypercholesterolemia for decades. Therefore, HMG-CoA reductase may be a decent&#xD;
      molecular target for anti-cancer therapy and statins may be readily applicable to the clinic&#xD;
      once its potential role as an anticancer drug is established. The statins have recently&#xD;
      gained attractions from medical oncologists because large retrospective analyses for efficacy&#xD;
      trials of statins in coronary artery disease have shown that not only are these agents able&#xD;
      to reduce cardiac disease-related mortality, but cancer incidence is also reduced by 28 - 33&#xD;
      %.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In all, further clinical trials investigating on combining the standard treatment with these&#xD;
      novel molecular targeting agents, the statins, are definitely warranted.&#xD;
