      The investigators propose to test the hypothesis that the incidence of major complications&#xD;
      related to infection or inadequate healing is reduced in morbidly obese patients given 80%&#xD;
      inspired oxygen during, and for 12-18 hours after, surgery compared with patients given 80%&#xD;
      oxygen only during surgery. The primary outcome will be a composite of major complications&#xD;
      plausibly related to infection or healing.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Wound infection is a common and serious consequence of anesthesia and surgery. Infection is&#xD;
      associated with major complications including intra-abdominal abscess, peritonitis without&#xD;
      leakage, and sepsis. The average wound infection thus prolongs hospitalization by a week,&#xD;
      doubles the need for ICU care, and doubles mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first few hours following bacterial contamination constitute a decisive period during&#xD;
      which infection is established. Techniques aimed at improving resistance to surgical wound&#xD;
      infections are thus most effective when implemented during the decisive period - even though&#xD;
      infections are not detected clinically until five-to-ten days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary defense against surgical pathogens is oxidative killing by neutrophils. This&#xD;
      reaction critically depends on tissue oxygen tension. It is therefore unsurprising that&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue oxygen tension (PsqO2) is inversely correlated with the risk of surgical&#xD;
      wound infection. As might be expected, supplemental perioperative oxygen administration&#xD;
      increases tissue oxygen partial pressure (compared with an FIO2 of 30%) and decreases wound&#xD;
      infection risk. While 100% oxygen is associated with atelectasis and pulmonary inflammation,&#xD;
      we and others have shown that 80% oxygen is not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequate healing is also common. Scar formation starts with transcription of pro-collagen,&#xD;
      which undergoes post-translational hydroxylation of the abundant proline and lysine residues.&#xD;
      This promotes the cross-linking within and between collagen strands that provides tensile&#xD;
      strength which begins the healing process. The prolyl and lysyl hydroxylases that catalyze&#xD;
      this reaction depend on the substrate oxygen. The Km (substrate concentration at which the&#xD;
      velocity of the reaction is half-maximal) for O2 of prolyl hydroxylase has been variously&#xD;
      estimated at 20, 25, and 100 mmHg. Even using the most conservative estimate, these data&#xD;
      suggest that proline hydroxylation of collagen (e.g., scar formation) will be PO2 dependent&#xD;
      through the range of 0 to â‰ˆ200 mmHg, with 90% of the effect occurring by 90 mmHg. In vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo animal evidence supports this theory. Inadequate healing is associated with&#xD;
      anastomotic leakage, wound dehiscence, and bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In morbidly obese patients, the incidence of infection and major complications related to&#xD;
      either infection or inadequate healing is 15-20% after gastric bypass based on our&#xD;
      preliminary data and a review of records at Washington University. Roughly 30% of the&#xD;
      American population is now obese with a body mass index (BMI) &gt; 30 kg/m2; about 5% of the&#xD;
      population is morbidly obese, with a BMI exceeding 40 kg/m2. These patients are at&#xD;
      extraordinarily high risk of wound infection, and infections in these patients are especially&#xD;
      severe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiac output, circulating blood volume, and resting oxygen consumption are all increased in&#xD;
      the obese; however, total blood flow is sub-normal in relation to body weight. Obesity&#xD;
      augments the size of individual fat cells without increasing blood flow. Specifically, fat&#xD;
      tissue is hypoperfused and poorly oxygenated. Intraoperative tissue oxygenation is abnormally&#xD;
      low in obese patients and postoperative tissue oxygenation is especially low - although it&#xD;
      can be improved by oxygen administration. It thus seems likely that inadequate tissue&#xD;
      oxygenation contributes to the observed extraordinary high wound infection risk in obese&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although supplemental oxygen during surgery and for the first two-to-six hours after surgery&#xD;
      halves the risk of surgical wound infection, it remains unknown whether prolonged&#xD;
      supplemental postoperative oxygen significantly augments the benefits of intraoperative&#xD;
      oxygen. There is some evidence suggesting that prolonged postoperative oxygen administration&#xD;
      may be helpful. For example, experimental infections in guinea pigs are reduced by&#xD;
      administration of supplemental oxygen for 45 h. In contrast, restricting oxygen for only 45&#xD;
      minutes after contamination reduces tensile wound strength in rabbits no more than&#xD;
      restricting oxygen for 5 full days. No study in humans has evaluated the effects of&#xD;
      supplemental postoperative oxygen on surgical wound infection or associated complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To the extent that supplemental oxygen after surgery is likely to reduce the incidence of&#xD;
      major complications related to wound infection and healing, benefit is especially likely in&#xD;
      morbidly obese patients because their baseline tissue oxygenation is usually sub-optimal and&#xD;
      their risk is high. We thus propose to test the hypothesis that the incidence of major&#xD;
      complications related to infection or inadequate healing are reduced in morbidly obese&#xD;
      patients given 80% inspired oxygen during and for 12-18 hours after surgery compared with&#xD;
      patients given 80% oxygen only during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled at two OUTCOMES RESEARCH Group sites: the University of Louisville&#xD;
      and the Cleveland Clinic. Patients undergoing gastric bypass will all be given 80%&#xD;
      intraoperative oxygen and then randomly assigned to 30% or 80% oxygen until the first&#xD;
      postoperative morning. The primary outcome will be a composite of major complications&#xD;
      plausibly related to infection or healing. A maximum of 1,276 patients will provide a 90%&#xD;
      power to detect a 25% reduction in the proportion of patients with at least one major&#xD;
      complication. Supplemental oxygen is safe and inexpensive, costing only a few dollars per&#xD;
      patient. Confirming our hypothesis would indicate that clinicians can reduce the risk of&#xD;
      serious complications by making an essentially trivial modification in postoperative patient&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
