  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a new colonoscopic viewing technique called&#xD;
      narrow band imaging (NBI)can help doctors detect more patients with at least one&#xD;
      pre-cancerous area than conventional colonoscopy using white light alone in patients with&#xD;
      genetically inherited high risk for bowel cancer (HNPCC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer is the second commonest cause of cancer death. Some people have an&#xD;
      inherited defect in the genes which repair DNA which results in a very high risk of&#xD;
      colorectal (bowel) cancer at a young age. This syndrome is called hereditary non-polyposis&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (HNPCC) or Lynch syndrome. Colonoscopic surveillance of HNPCC patients has&#xD;
      been shown to reduce the risk of colorectal cancer and allow detection at an earlier stage,&#xD;
      but even with meticulous examination, some precancerous lesions or cancers are missed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precancerous lesions in HNPCC are difficult to see and may be advanced even if as small as a&#xD;
      few millimeters. Endoscopists have used spraying dye on the lining of bowel (Chromoendoscopy)&#xD;
      successfully to improve detection of abnormal areas; however this is time consuming and&#xD;
      requires extra time and equipment and despite the benefits seen in two studies is not widely&#xD;
      used in routine clinical practice in the UK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Narrow Band Imaging (NBI) is a technique that relies on light to improve contrast for the&#xD;
      smallest blood vessels in the bowel lining which shows up precancerous areas as they have a&#xD;
      richer vascular network. It is sometimes described as &quot;digital chromoendoscopy&quot; as the images&#xD;
      produced are similar to chromoendoscopy, but it is much simpler and quicker to use. With&#xD;
      magnification it allows assessment of the fine mucosal surace pattern (pit pattern) of lesion&#xD;
      which allows an assessment of their likelihood of being precancerous. Autofluorescence&#xD;
      endoscopy uses short wavelength light and light filters to produce a false colour image of&#xD;
      the bowel lining where polyps stand out. These techniques have been used with some success in&#xD;
      the oesophagus and stomach but little work is available for the colon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to see if NBI with magnification is better than standard colonoscopy for detecting&#xD;
      precancerous areas. This is likely as it produces images similar to chromoendoscopy which is&#xD;
      already shown to help. If a potentially precancerous area is found we will use other types of&#xD;
      endoscopy, in particular NBI and autofluorescence to see if these techniques are helpful for&#xD;
      discriminating between pre-cancerous and non-cancerous areas.&#xD;
