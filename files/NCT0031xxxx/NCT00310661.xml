  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TD is a troublesome and potentially irreversible side effect associated with the use of&#xD;
      neuroleptics. While the newer neuroleptics are improved in this regard, they all still carry&#xD;
      the risk of TD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study proposes that sarizotan is a potential agent for treating&#xD;
      neuroleptic-induced TD based on preliminary data indicating efficacy in the management of&#xD;
      dyskinesias associated with Parkinson's disease. Its efficacy is further substantiated by&#xD;
      pre-clinical data obtained from the vacuous chewing movement (VCM) model in rats, a model we&#xD;
      employ ourselves in investigating the relationship between D2 occupancy and TD. The present&#xD;
      study also examines the effects of sarizotan on cognitive function, given the association&#xD;
      between TD and cognitive deficits.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to assess the safety and the anti-dyskinetic properties&#xD;
      of sarizotan at various dosages for neuroleptic-induced TD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to assess the effects of sarizotan on cognitive&#xD;
      function in patients with neuroleptic-induced TD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of neuroleptic-induced TD will be confirmed by history and physical&#xD;
      examination. Patients will be evaluated at baseline, 2, 4, 8, and 12 weeks. Safety will be&#xD;
      assessed by vital signs, ECG, routine blood tests, the ACTH stimulation test, and the&#xD;
      clinician's and patient's global impression of tolerability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For efficacy, the primary outcome variable will be changes in the Abnormal Involuntary&#xD;
      Movement Scale (AIMS), and a baseline score of &gt;3 ('moderate') will be required for item 8&#xD;
      (Severity of Abnormal Movements). Quantitative evaluation of movements will be carried out in&#xD;
      two ways. The first involves a series of instrumental and clinical measures that were&#xD;
      developed as a battery for the assessment of antipsychotic-induced parkinsonism and TD. The&#xD;
      second means of quantifying the movements involves the use of video recording, with&#xD;
      independent evaluation by several raters (Appendix I). Such approaches have gained popularity&#xD;
      in the quantification of movement disorders as a means of improving reliability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measures will include the positive and negative syndrome scale (PANSS) and other&#xD;
      movement disorder scales (Simpson-Angus Rating Scales) for acute extrapyramidal symptoms&#xD;
      (EPS), and the Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS). Global impressions of efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability by the clinician (CGI) and by the patients (PGI) will be recorded at all study&#xD;
      visits after the commencement of treatment. To assess potential cognitive changes that may&#xD;
      occur in conjunction with TD changes, a battery of neuropsychological tests will be carried&#xD;
      out at baseline and endpoint (see Appendix II). To assess the relationship with primary&#xD;
      negative symptoms such as the deficit syndrome, the total and sub-scales of the Positive and&#xD;
      Negative Syndrome Scale will be evaluated.&#xD;
