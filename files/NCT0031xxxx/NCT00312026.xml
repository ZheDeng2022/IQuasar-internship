    <textblock>
      This is a Phase IV randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to evaluate the safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of SC efalizumab in adult patients (18 years of age and older) with chronic&#xD;
      moderate to severe plaque psoriasis involving the hands and/or feet who have had no previous&#xD;
      exposure to efalizumab. The study will consist of a screening period, a treatment period, and&#xD;
