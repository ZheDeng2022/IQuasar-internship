      The purpose of this clinical trial is to evaluate the ability of multiple serum biomarkers to&#xD;
      estimate the risk of ovarian cancer in women presenting with pelvic mass (defined as a&#xD;
      simple, complex or a solid ovarian cyst / pelvic mass).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The Pelvic Mass study is a prospective, multi-center, double blind, statistically powered&#xD;
      clinical trial that will enroll female subjects â‰¥18 years of age presenting to a gynecologist&#xD;
      or gynecological oncologist with a pelvic mass (defined as a simple, complex or a solid&#xD;
      ovarian cyst / pelvic mass) who are scheduled to undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The serum tumor marker CA125 has been the most widely used marker in ovarian cancer, however,&#xD;
      it is not sufficiently sensitive or specific for the detection of early stage disease. The&#xD;
      levels of soluble mesothelin related peptides (SMRP) and HE4 have also recently been found to&#xD;
      be elevated in women with ovarian cancer. The results of a pilot study suggest that the use&#xD;
      of HE4 may improve the sensitivity of CA125 and provide for stratification of patients&#xD;
      presenting with a pelvic mass into high, intermediate and low risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HE4 and CA125 serum levels will be evaluated in this study for their ability to stratify&#xD;
      patients presenting with a pelvic mass into risk groups with low, intermediate or high&#xD;
      probabilities of harboring an ovarian cancer at the time of initial presentation. The&#xD;
      algorithm using these two serum markers to stratify patients that was developed using pilot&#xD;
      study data will be evaluated in this prospective multicenter pelvic mass study. We will also&#xD;
      evaluate the inclusion of additional biomarkers and risk factors, such as ultrasound score,&#xD;
      age, and menopausal status, into the algorithm to see if there is any improvement in the&#xD;
      stratification of patients into the risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to estimate the risk of finding ovarian cancer at the&#xD;
      time of surgery in pre- and post-menopausal women presenting with pelvic mass. Multiple serum&#xD;
      biomarkers (CA125 and HE4) will be evaluated to estimate the risk that the patient is&#xD;
      harboring an ovarian cancer at the time of presentation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to develop a multivariate predictive algorithm&#xD;
      combining CA125 and HE4 with radiological imaging results, and patient risk factors (such as&#xD;
      age, menopausal status and ethnicity) to estimate the risk of ovarian cancer, including low&#xD;
      malignant potential (LMP) / borderline tumors, at the time of surgery in patients presenting&#xD;
      with a pelvic mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory endpoints will include the evaluation of serum, plasma and/or urine levels of&#xD;
      CA125, HE4 and other additional novel biomarkers such as SMRP, alone and in combination with&#xD;
      radiological imaging results and subject risk factors to determine their ability to estimate&#xD;
      the risk of cancer at the time of surgery in patients presenting with a pelvic mass.&#xD;
