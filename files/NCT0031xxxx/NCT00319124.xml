      To identify differences between patients with OA of the hip in an early stage and a healthy&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1 There are significant differences between patients with OA of the hip in an&#xD;
      early stage and a healthy control group in terms of functional capacity, biomechanical /&#xD;
      kinematic variables, muscle strength and range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osteoarthritis (OA) is by far the most prevalent joint disorder today. The knee and the hip&#xD;
      are large joints to be targeted and is an important cause of pain and disability. In knee OA,&#xD;
      it is shown that significant risk factors in developing the disease are quadriceps weakness,&#xD;
      joint instability, and changes in joint loading. A few studies on hip OA have shown altered&#xD;
      gait pattern, which affect joint loading, and one study has shown weakness in abductors,&#xD;
      adductors and flexors around the hip. As joint loading and muscle weakness are important&#xD;
      factors in the development in knee OA, it might as well be factors influencing OA in the hip.&#xD;
      The purpose of this case-control studies was to compare hip OA patients to a healthy control&#xD;
      group regarding biomechanical and clinical differences. Patients with hip pain, activity&#xD;
      limitations (Harris Hip Score 60-95 p) and radiographically verified hip OA was included. The&#xD;
      healthy control group will have a Harris Hip Score of 100 p. One hundred and ten patients and&#xD;
      fifty controls will be asked to fill in questionnaires on pain, stiffness and physical&#xD;
      function (WOMAC), quality-of-life (SF-36 v2), self-efficacy (Lorigue), and activity (PASE) in&#xD;
      addition to perform 6-minute walk test, sub-maximal cardiovascular function, strength, and&#xD;
      hip range of motion tests. Additionally, Qualisys Pro reflex 3D motion analysis system will&#xD;
      be used during walking, one-leg standing, and raising from a chair on a sub-group of 40&#xD;
      patients and 20 controls.&#xD;

      Aim 1 To identify differences between patients with OA of the hip in an early stage and a&#xD;
      healthy control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1 There are significant differences between patients with OA of the hip in an&#xD;
      early stage and a healthy control group in terms of functional capacity, biomechanical /&#xD;
      kinematic variables, muscle strength and range of motion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design. A case-control study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion / exclusion criteria. Twenty-five patients diagnosed with unilateral or bilateral&#xD;
      OA of the hip will be recruited from the Norwegian Sport Medicine Centre, Diakonhjemmet and&#xD;
      from the Orthopaedic Centre, Ullevål University Hospital, Oslo, Norway. PPatients will also&#xD;
      be recruited through ads in newspaper and brief information in national tv. Radiographiccally&#xD;
      verified OA of the hip will be in accordance with Danielsson's criteria for minimal joint&#xD;
      space. Patients will be excluded if they have a history of resent trauma or functional&#xD;
      impairment to the lower limbs or diseases which might interfere with participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects will have no health problems and no injuries or functional impairment to the&#xD;
      lower limbs and will be matched to the patients with OA of the hip by age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background descriptive data, including anthropometrical (age, gender, height, weight) and&#xD;
      sociodemographic information (marital status, social support, leisure time, sick-leave,&#xD;
      physical activity, occupational background, co-morbidity, hip pain history, former treatment&#xD;
      for hip pain / OA), and consumption of analgetics will be collected by questionnaire at&#xD;
      inclusion. Outcome measures will cover all functional levels defined by the World Health&#xD;
      Organization's (WHO) International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health&#xD;
      (2002) and will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pain and activity limitation: Hip pain will be assessed by a horizontal visual analogue scale&#xD;
      (VAS) (0-100 mm; 0 represents &quot;no pain&quot; and 100 represents &quot;as much pain he/she can possibly&#xD;
      imagine&quot;) (Revill et al. 1976). Both self-reported and observed functional capacity will be&#xD;
      evaluated. Self-reported functional capacity will be registered by the disease-specific&#xD;
      questionnaire Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC) (Bellamy&#xD;
      et al. 1988). Observed functional capacity will be assessed by the 6 minute walking test&#xD;
      (Enright, 2003), where the patient is instructed to walk as quickly/fast as possible forth&#xD;
      and back on a 20 m course, and by the subaximal bikecycle test (Astrand, 1986) where the&#xD;
      heart-rate is registered on a constant load and speed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health related quality of life and pain management: Quality of life will be assessed by using&#xD;
      the generic questionnaire SF-36 v.2 (Jenkinson, 1999). Self-efficacy beliefs for pain will be&#xD;
      registered using the self-efficacy subscale for controlling pain developed by Lorig et al&#xD;
      (Lorig et al. 1989). The scale is found to be valid and reproducible in patients with chronic&#xD;
      arthritis (Lorig et al. 1989).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gait analysis: Kinematic data will be collected using Qualisys pro-reflex motion analysis&#xD;
      system with eight cameras at a sampling frequency of 240 Hz and synchronized with two force&#xD;
      platforms sampling at a rate of 960Hz (AMTI Model LG6). All markers will be present during&#xD;
      standing calibration. During the dynamic trials all the anatomical markers will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be instructed to walk along a 17m walkway in which two force plates are&#xD;
      embedded. The subjects will walk at their self-selected pace and practice trials will be&#xD;
      performed until the subject could contact the force platforms with only one foot (not&#xD;
      targeting) and with a constant velocity within 5% deviation. Speed will be measured by&#xD;
      photoelectric beams located 3.06m apart, midway along the walkway. Experienced physical&#xD;
      therapists will be responsible for patient information, instruction and data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle strength: Muscle strength of hip extensors, -flexors, knee flexors and -extensors, and&#xD;
      ankle flexors and extensors, in addition to ankle plantar flexion will be tested&#xD;
      isokinetically according to the manufacturer's manual (Cybex 6000). Isokinetic muscle testing&#xD;
      is commonly used in the literature in various patient populations (Inkster et al. 2003; Holm&#xD;
      et al. 2000b; Brox et al. 1995; Lephart et al. 1993; Newton et al. 1993). The test protocol&#xD;
      will consist of five repetitions at an angular velocity of 60 deg/sec at maximal performance.&#xD;
      In order to prepare patients for the test, eliminate learning effects and to obtain stable&#xD;
      performance, patients will be given four test-repetitions at the same speed before the main&#xD;
      test. An experienced physical therapist will perform the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Range of motion: Range of motion will be measured by goniometer according to standard&#xD;
      procedures (Holm et al. 2000a).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up: Data will be collected at inclusion (patients and control subjects) and after the&#xD;
      intervention period (patients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blinding: Personnel responsible for the intervention will not be involved in data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registration of complications, drop-outs and adherence: Complications and drop-outs will be&#xD;
      registered by persons responsible for data collection. Adherence to the exercise protocol&#xD;
      will be registered by the physical therapists responsible for the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculations: Lack of information from studies of comparable OA populations in the&#xD;
      literature makes it difficult to make precise power calculations. Assumption of sample size&#xD;
      (110 patients and 50 control subjects) is therefore based on results from former studies in&#xD;
      patients with OA of the knee or mixed populations of knee- and hip patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: Both non-parametric and parametric statistics will be used for data&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics: All patients and control subjects will receive written and oral information about the&#xD;
      study and sign an informed consent before inclusion (enclosed). The project will be performed&#xD;
      according to recommendations of the Helsinki Declaration and application will be sent to the&#xD;
      Regional Committee of Medical Research Ethics in Oslo in November 2003.&#xD;
