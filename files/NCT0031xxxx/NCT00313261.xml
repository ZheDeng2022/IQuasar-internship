        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients who received placebo in L-FMAU-201 study&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Female of childbearing potential with a negative serum (beta-HCG) pregnancy test&#xD;
             within 14 days of starting therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patients who were able to give written informed consent prior to study start and to&#xD;
             comply with the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients who met the following criteria after completion of the Week 48 visit were to&#xD;
             have additional follow-up visits at Weeks 54 and 60:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1)had received no additional therapy since completion of 24-week treatment of clevudine and&#xD;
        2)experienced a &gt;= 1 log10 decrease from baseline in HBV DNA at Week 48&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient with HBeAg seroconverted to anti-HBe at the last 2 consecutive visits (one&#xD;
             month apart) in L-FMAU-201 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient who was currently receiving antiviral, immunomodulatory or corticosteroid&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Patient who was treated with lamivudine, lobucavir, famciclovir, adefovir or any other&#xD;
             investigational nucleoside for HBV infection after cessation of treatment in&#xD;
             L-FMAU-201 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient who had a history of ascites, variceal hemorrhage or hepatic encephalopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patient who was co-infected with HCV, HDV or HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Patient with clinical evidence of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
             (Â®-Fetoprotein)Evaluation was based on alpha-fetoprotein primarily. If&#xD;
             alpha-fetoprotein level was suggestive of cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma,&#xD;
             confirmation was made with ultrasonography etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patient who was pregnant or breast-feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patient who was unwilling to use an &quot;effective&quot; method of contraception during&#xD;

             should be used. Females must be surgically sterile (via hysterectomy or bilateral&#xD;
             tubal ligation), post-menopausal or using at least a medically acceptable barrier&#xD;
             method of contraception (i.e., IUD, barrier methods with supermicide or abstinence)&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Patient who had a clinically relevant history of abuse of alcohol or drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patient who had a significant gastrointestinal, renal, hepatic (decompensated),&#xD;
             bronchopulmonary, neurological, cardiovascular, oncologic or allergic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patient who had creatinine clearance less than 60mL/min as estimated by the following&#xD;
             formula:&#xD;
&#xD;
        (140-age in years) (body weight [kg])/(72) (serum creatinine [mg/dL]) [Note: multiply&#xD;
        estimates by 0.85 for women]&#xD;
