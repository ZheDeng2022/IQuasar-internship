      RATIONALE: Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as thiotepa, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.&#xD;
      Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving chemotherapy and&#xD;
      radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying how well thiotepa works together with radiation&#xD;
      therapy in treating young patients with newly diagnosed malignant brain tumors.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine tumor response to adjuvant thiotepa followed by radiotherapy in pediatric&#xD;
           patients with newly diagnosed malignant astrocytic tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the acute and chronic toxicity of thiotepa in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the variability in thiotepa metabolism by measuring plasma and cerebrospinal&#xD;
           fluid pharmacokinetics of thiotepa and tepa in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop a phase II study framework model, to determine the chemosensitivity to new,&#xD;
           single-agent regimens in the treatment of high-grade (malignant) astrocytic tumors,&#xD;
           including anaplastic astrocytoma, glioblastoma, giant cell glioblastoma, and&#xD;
           gliosarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the incidence of distant neuraxial metastases in patients at the time of&#xD;
           relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the 1-year disease-free survival rate in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study. Patients are stratified by age (3-15 vs 16-20 years of&#xD;
      age).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chemotherapy: Patients receive thiotepa IV continuously over 168 hours on days 1-7.&#xD;
           Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 2 courses. Patients then proceed to&#xD;
           radiotherapy after blood counts recover.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiotherapy: Patients undergo external-beam radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week, for&#xD;
           approximately 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-radiation chemotherapy: Patients with complete, partial, or objective response, or&#xD;
           stable disease after 2 courses of thiotepa may receive thiotepa alone for up to 8 more&#xD;
           courses at the discretion of the treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed periodically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 30 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
