  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the improved prognosis of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, end stage liver&#xD;
      disease due to hepatitis C (HCV) now represents a major cause of morbidity and mortality in&#xD;
      people with HIV. Treatment for HCV has become increasingly important as a means of preventing&#xD;
      the consequences of chronic HCV infection. Paradoxically, co-infected patients have low rates&#xD;
      of treatment initiation and completion in large part because they have a high risk of&#xD;
      developing neuropsychiatric symptoms while receiving PEG-interferon (PEG-IFN). There are a&#xD;
      large number of co-infected individuals in Canada who could benefit from HCV therapy if&#xD;
      tolerability could be improved. This trial will address whether prophylactic use of&#xD;
      antidepressants in HIV-HCV infected patients initiating HCV therapy can prevent the&#xD;
      development of neuropsychiatric side effects and thus permit more patients to receive full&#xD;
      treatment for HCV.&#xD;

      Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a Canadian multicentre randomized, double-blind placebo controlled trial. We&#xD;
      will evaluate whether prophylactic citalopram compared to symptomatic treatment of depression&#xD;
      can significantly increase the amount of HCV therapy received in co-infected patients during&#xD;
      the first 24 weeks. Post study follow-up will extend until 6 months after cessation of HCV&#xD;
      therapy (up to 72 weeks) to capture information on SVR (sustained virologic response) for&#xD;
      HCV. 76 patients will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to citalopram or placebo. Patients will be&#xD;
      stratified by study centre and HCV genotype. Citalopram (or placebo) will begin 3 weeks&#xD;
      before HCV treatment at an initial dose of 10 mg per day then be increased to 20 mg per day&#xD;
      after one week and continued throughout treatment with PEG-IFN/ribavirin (up to 48 weeks) and&#xD;
      then tapered to discontinuation at completion of HCV therapy. The management of depression&#xD;
      emerging in study participants is mandated in the protocol to ensure that the original&#xD;
      treatment assignments remain blinded while allowing for all subjects to remain in the study&#xD;
      and mimics what would take place in clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyses will follow the intention-to-treat approach. Random regression modelling will be&#xD;
      employed to analyse longitudinal data on adherence to prescribed PEG-IFN and ribavirin dosage&#xD;
      at weeks 12 and 24. Survival analyses will be used to compare the two treatment groups with&#xD;
      respect to the time to the development of depressions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic antidepressants may not only prevent overt depression but may also diminish the&#xD;
      development of sub-clinical depressed mood. Effective prevention of a broad range of&#xD;
      neuropsychiatric symptoms by use of citalopram has the potential to diminish morbidity&#xD;
      associated with PEG-IFN treatment and consequently allow a greater number of patients to&#xD;
      complete full therapy. In addition, such an approach may help patients remain adherent to&#xD;
      their HIV therapy during the course of HCV treatment which could have long-term personal and&#xD;
      public health implications by preventing the emergence of HIV resistance. Furthermore, if&#xD;
      shown to be an effective strategy for preventing neuropsychiatric symptoms, treatment for HCV&#xD;
      may become more accessible to the large number of patients who may not have ready access to&#xD;
      the frequent and intensive psychiatric monitoring, necessary for the early detection and&#xD;
      treatment of depression that manifests on PEG-IFN.&#xD;
