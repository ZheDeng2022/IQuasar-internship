  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Interleukin-2 (IL-2) is a protein found naturally in the blood that helps boost the immune&#xD;
      system. The purpose of this study is to provide long-term treatment and monitoring of HIV&#xD;
      infected people enrolled in NIAID-funded studies investigating the use of laboratory-made&#xD;
      IL-2 for the treatment of HIV infection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IL-2 is a biological response modifier that can improve the body's response to disease. It is&#xD;
      hoped that IL-2 treatment can help restore CD4 cell counts and immune function in people&#xD;
      whose immune systems have been damaged by HIV. Over the last 10 years, NIAID has sponsored a&#xD;
      number of important studies of IL-2 in HIV infected people; many of these trials are ongoing.&#xD;
      This study was developed in an effort consolidate these separate, smaller trials into one&#xD;
      larger study so that results between the trials can be shared and used to develop future&#xD;
      protocols. This study is an umbrella study that will provide long-term administrative&#xD;
      support, treatment, and monitoring for ongoing Phase I and II IL-2 trials and their&#xD;
      participants. It is primarily intended for patients in the extension phases of any previous&#xD;
      NIAID Clinical Center HIV Program (NIAID/CCMD) intramural research protocols in which IL-2&#xD;
      therapy continues to be offered. Blood collection will occur through a patient's&#xD;
      participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to follow the protocol in which they originally enrolled. A&#xD;
      desired therapeutic goal or &quot;CD4 plateau&quot; will be used in most cases to help clinicians&#xD;
      determine when a participant requires additional IL-2. In general, if a participant has two&#xD;
      or more consecutive CD4 counts below the CD4 plateau, additional IL-2 will be administered to&#xD;
      that patient. In maintaining uniformity among the many trials being consolidated under this&#xD;
      trial, the frequency and nature of study visits will be solely dictated by this umbrella&#xD;
      study. Participants will also be asked to join an optional substudy: Interrupted Versus&#xD;
      Continuous Antiretrovirals Involving Randomization from the Umbrella Study (ICARUS).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  HIV-1 infected&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current participation and presently in good standing in a NIAID/CCMD clinical trial&#xD;
             involving the use of IL-2 for the treatment of HIV-1 infection. Additional HIV-1&#xD;
             infected people who are IL-2 naive may be selected by the investigator for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to take antiretrovirals within a 10-day period surrounding each IL-2 cycle.&#xD;
             Individual protocols may be modified as needed by the investigator to permit IL-2&#xD;
             therapy in the absence of antiretrovirals.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to accept additional IL-2 therapy when needed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to use acceptable forms of contraception during a minimum 10-day period&#xD;
             surrounding each IL-2 injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of noncompliance with prior NIAID/CCMD protocols&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any organic central nervous system (CNS) abnormality requiring treatment with&#xD;
             antiseizure medication&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unless previously exempted for this requirement, current or history of Crohn's&#xD;
             disease, psoriasis, or other autoimmune or inflammatory disease with potentially&#xD;
             life-threatening complications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant heart, lung, kidney, rheumatologic, gastrointestinal, or CNS disease that&#xD;
             may pose an unacceptable risk to the participant during IL-2 therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Psychiatric illness that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere with the&#xD;
             study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current or recent substance abuse that, in the opinion of the investigator, may&#xD;
             interfere with the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refuse to follow Clinical Center policy on partner notification&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of optic neuritis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Refuse to allow extra blood specimens to be stored for potential use in future studies&#xD;
             of HIV-1 infection or the immune system&#xD;
