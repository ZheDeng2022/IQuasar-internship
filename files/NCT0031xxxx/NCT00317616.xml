  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pre-fALS is a prospective natural history and biomarker study of people not yet affected with&#xD;
      ALS, but who are at genetic risk for developing ALS. The investigators aim to recruit&#xD;
      unaffected (healthy) people from familial ALS (fALS) pedigrees in which a known genetic&#xD;
      mutation associated with ALS has been identified; for this study, a fALS pedigree is one with&#xD;
      two biologically related individuals who have or have had ALS and/or FTD. Individuals who may&#xD;
      be at genetic risk for ALS and who belong to families with at least one affected family&#xD;
      member who has tested positive for a known ALS genetic mutation may also be eligible to&#xD;
      participate. Our goal is to study the pre-symptomatic phase, onset and progression of ALS and&#xD;
      to learn more about genetic and environmental factors that put people at risk for developing&#xD;
      ALS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy individuals from fALS families with a known genetic mutation will be included in this&#xD;
      study. We encourage people who have previously undergone genetic testing and were found to&#xD;
      carry the mutation that affects their family as well as those who do not know their genetic&#xD;
      status to contact us. Those who wish to participate and to learn the results of genetic&#xD;
      testing, may do so after undergoing genetic counseling. It is also possible to participate&#xD;
      without learning the results of genetic testing. Participants eligible to complete study&#xD;
      visits will travel to Miami (at our expense) approximately every 12-24 months for a period of&#xD;
      10 years or longer and will perform various biomarker procedures. Between visits,&#xD;
      participants will complete phone calls about their health.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A member of a family in which a mutation in a gene associated with ALS has been&#xD;
             identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No symptoms to suggest the presence of ALS (i.e. study participants must currently be&#xD;
             healthy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Having at least 50% probability of carrying an ALS associated gene mutation based on&#xD;
             family pedigree.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness to undergo genetic testing, with the option of whether or not to learn the&#xD;
             results.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and availability to travel to Miami for a few days approximately every 12&#xD;
             to 24 months to complete biomarker procedures (e.g, MRI, blood draws, spinal&#xD;
             tab/lumbar puncture, cognitive testing)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of ALS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition or situation which, in the PI's opinion, could confound the biomarker&#xD;
             data or may interfere with the individual's participation and compliance with the&#xD;
             study protocol, including but not limited to neurological, psychological and/or&#xD;
             medical conditions.&#xD;
