      The purpose of this study is to determine and compare the efficacy of Campath-1H/Tacrolimus&#xD;
      versus ATG/Tacrolimus/MMF therapy in conjunction with initial short-term steroids in Type&#xD;
      1-diabetic patients undergoing simultaneous pancreas-kidney allograft transplantation as well&#xD;
      as to evaluate the safety of Campath-1H/Tacrolimus versus ATG/Tacrolimus/MMF in terms of&#xD;
      drug-related complications and immunosuppression-associated complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Simultaneous pancreas-kidney (SPK) transplantation is a recommended treatment option for type&#xD;
      1-diabetic patients suffering from end-stage kidney disease.1 Major factors contributing to&#xD;
      the success of SPK transplantation include improvements in surgical technique and the&#xD;
      provision of effective immunosuppressive strategies heralded by the introduction of the&#xD;
      calcineurin inhibitors.2 According to the International Pancreas Transplant Registry (IPTR),&#xD;
      since the mid-1990s, the most popular maintenance therapy has been with Tacrolimus and&#xD;
      Mycophenolate Mofetil (MMF), utilized in approximately 66% of SPK transplanted recipients.&#xD;
      Since 1994, the proportion of pancreas recipients who received induction therapy has exceeded&#xD;
      70% and by that means induction therapy is used with greatest frequency for pancreas&#xD;
      recipients than for any other solid organ recipients. That is in accordance with the registry&#xD;
      analyses and the clinical trials listed below demonstrating the highest graft survival rates&#xD;
      for recipients given antibody induction therapy and maintained on Tacrolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large European multicenter study compared the efficacy and safety of Tacrolimus versus the&#xD;
      microemulsion formulation of Cyclosporine in 205 SPK recipients. All of the patients received&#xD;
      additionally rabbit anti-T-cell induction therapy, MMF and short-term corticosteroids. The&#xD;
      study showed a significantly higher pancreas graft survival rate with Tacrolimus (91%) than&#xD;
      with Cyclosporine (74%; P&lt;0.0005).3 A second US multicenter study focused on the effect of&#xD;
      antibody induction therapy in SPK recipients. The trial conducted at 18 US pancreas&#xD;
      transplant centers, randomized 87 recipients each to antibody induction therapy versus no&#xD;
      therapy. In the induction group, either T-cell depleting or nondepleting antibodies were&#xD;
      used. Maintenance therapy in both groups was Tacrolimus, MMF and steroids. At 3 years, actual&#xD;
      patient survival rates (94% vs. 90%) and pancreas graft survival rates (76% vs. 76%) were&#xD;
      similar between the two groups, but actual kidney survival rates were significantly higher in&#xD;
      the induction group (92% vs. 82%; P=0.04).4 A third US-Canadian multicenter study assessed&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of two dosing regimens of daclizumab versus no antibody induction in&#xD;
      185 SPK recipients maintained on Tacrolimus, MMF and steroids. The probability of either&#xD;
      kidney or pancreas rejection was lowest with two doses of daclizumab (P=0.042). The authors&#xD;
      concluded that daclizumab is effective in reducing the incidence of acute rejection in SPK&#xD;
      recipients, as compared with no antibody induction.5&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the past years increasingly more centers investigated the usage of Campath-1H&#xD;
      induction therapy in combination with the calcineurin inhibitors, MMF in the absence or with&#xD;
      a short course of steroids. A recent single-centre, retrospective study of SPK transplant&#xD;
      recipients involved two treatment arms with Campath (n=50) and Thymoglobuline (n=58). The&#xD;
      induction dose of Campath was 30mg and 6mg/kg for Thymoglobuline. Additionally all recipients&#xD;
      received a prednisone-free maintenance immunosuppressive regimen of Tacrolimus and Sirolimus&#xD;
      or MMF. The 3-year patient and graft survivals were excellent and similar between the&#xD;
      treatment arms. The mean creatinine value 1-year post-transplant was however lower in the&#xD;
      Campath subgroup (1.30 vs. 1.44 mg/dL). Furthermore advantages of Campath were shown by a&#xD;
      trend of decreased rates of CMV infection, PTLD and it was also less expensive.6 The purpose&#xD;
      of a further study was to evaluate Campath-1H preconditioning and Tacrolimus monotherapy in&#xD;
      pancreas transplant recipients. Thirty-seven consecutive pancreas transplants (20 SPK, 10 PAK&#xD;
      and 7 PTA) were followed up for 7 months, utilizing 30mg Campath-1H preconditioning. Two&#xD;
      grams of intravenous methylprednisolone were administered, one prior to starting the&#xD;
      Campath-1H and another at reperfusion. Patient survival was 100%. Pancreas and kidney graft&#xD;
      survivals were 94% and 90%, respectively. Interestingly, all rejection episodes were preceded&#xD;
      by tacrolimus trough levels &lt;9.0 ng/ml for an extended period of time, while allograft&#xD;
      rejection was not observed in pancreases or kidneys if the tacrolimus was &gt;10 ng/ml. During&#xD;
      the study period no infectious complications were seen. Although follow-up was short, these&#xD;
      results suggest that a regimen of Campath-1H induction and tacrolimus monotherapy represents&#xD;
      an effective immunosuppressive protocol for pancreas transplant recipients.7&#xD;
&#xD;
      As demonstrated above, an increasing number of transplant centres have proposed to withdraw&#xD;
      or avoid steroids, nevertheless calcineurin inhibitors have remained the backbone of most&#xD;
      immunosuppressive protocols. The use of antibody induction therapy for pancreas transplant&#xD;
      recipients has been guided by practical experience, in the absence of randomised prospective&#xD;
      trials.8 A multicenter trial involving 130 kidney transplant recipients has started in our&#xD;
      center, investigating the safety and efficacy of Campath-1H in combination with Tacrolimus&#xD;
      monotherapy compared to a standard Tacrolimus/MMF/steroid regimen, demonstrating excellent&#xD;
      results with virtually no complications or side effects with Tacrolimus monotherapy after&#xD;
      Campath-1H induction. Based on the existing clinical trials and the experience of Campath-1H&#xD;
      therapy in our center we would like to investigate the long-term safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      Campath-1H induction and Tacrolimus monotherapy compared to a standard regimen with ATG&#xD;
      induction, Tacrolimus, MMF and short term steroids in a controlled, prospective, randomised&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
