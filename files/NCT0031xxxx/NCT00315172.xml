  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-exercise activity thermogenesis (NEAT) is the energy expended engaging in daily&#xD;
      activities such as maintenance of posture, fidgeting, and other activities not specifically&#xD;
      designated as &quot;exercise.&quot; A growing body of evidence indicates that NEAT plays an important&#xD;
      role in overall energy balance; for example, differences in NEAT account for the ease with&#xD;
      which adults gain or lose weight during over- or under feeding. An intriguing and possibly&#xD;
      modifiable component of NEAT is fidgeting-like activity. In lean and overweight adults,&#xD;
      modulation of NEAT by augmenting fidgeting can increase short-term energy expenditure. It is&#xD;
      unknown whether NEAT can be altered in children, or whether augmenting NEAT in children can&#xD;
      change daily energy expenditure or body composition long-term. Children exhibit higher levels&#xD;
      of daily activity than adults, suggesting potentially profound differences in energy balance.&#xD;
      We propose to study the role of NEAT in children to determine if: a) the fidgeting component&#xD;
      of NEAT can be measured accurately and reproducibly in children; b) NEAT can be increased by&#xD;
      devices that remind children to engage in fidgeting-like activities; and c) manipulation of&#xD;
      fidgeting-NEAT can significantly change energy expenditure and body composition. Thirty lean&#xD;
      and thirty overweight children will be enrolled and treated in a pilot feasibility study. By&#xD;
      adapting technologies developed to measure activity in adults, children's behavior and&#xD;
      thermogenesis will be recorded and analyzed to study question (a). To address study questions&#xD;
      (b) and (c), we will ask children to wear a timer that vibrate on a fixed interval schedule&#xD;
      and be randomly assigned to two conditions: the intervention or active condition, during&#xD;
      which children will be cued by the timer to engage in a fidgeting behavior (rapidly moving&#xD;
      their heel up and down), and the control condition, during which children will be asked to&#xD;
      perform a less thermogenic activity (noting the cue). Children will then cross over so that&#xD;
      each child will complete both conditions. Primary outcome measures for question (a) will be&#xD;
      changes in energy expenditure when subjects are asked to fidget in a laboratory environment.&#xD;
      The correlation of these energy expenditure measurements with new activity monitoring&#xD;
      technologies will also be obtained, so that such equipment can be used for measurements under&#xD;
      free-living conditions. For study questions (b) and (c), compliance with prescribed fidgeting&#xD;
      regimens in a free living environment and the changes in energy expenditure and body&#xD;
      composition will be determined over a 2 week interval. This pilot study will enable the&#xD;
      determination of the sample size needed to assess the efficacy of a longer term NEAT&#xD;
      intervention in children.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will qualify if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Good general health. Individuals taking medications for any serious medical condition&#xD;
             will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age 7 to 11 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Body Mass Index 15th to 85th percentile for lean children or greater than or equal to&#xD;
             95% for age for overweight children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Pre-pubertal (breast Tanner I - III for girls, testes size less than or equal to 10 mL&#xD;
             for boys).&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Volunteers will be excluded for the following reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of major illnesses: renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal, most endocrinologic&#xD;
             (e.g., Cushing syndrome, untreated hyper- or hypothyroidism), hematological problems&#xD;
             or pulmonary disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Taking any medications that might interfere with weight or growth such as oral&#xD;
             steroids, or psychotropic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of movement or tic disorders, since conditions increasing involuntary&#xD;
             movements may interfere with the measurement of NEAT.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Individuals who are taking and/or have taken stimulant or weight loss medications in&#xD;
             the last 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Individuals who cannot commit to living in a similar environment with similar levels&#xD;
             of activity during the two weeks they wear the activity monitors and timer (i.e.&#xD;
             cannot have one week wearing the activity monitors in school and the other week&#xD;
             wearing the activity monitors on a ski vacation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Intentional weight loss of more than 3 percent of body weight in the past two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Weight in excess of 300 lbs, because of the weight limits of the dual energy x-ray&#xD;
             absorptiometry (DXA) scanners available at the NIH Clinical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Inability to undergo MRI (e.g., volunteers with metal within their bodies including&#xD;
             cardiac pacemakers, neural pacemakers, aneurysmal clips, shrapnel, ocular foreign&#xD;
             bodies, cochlear implants, non-detachable electronic or electromechanical devices such&#xD;
             as infusion pumps, nerve stimulators, bone growth stimulators, etc. that are&#xD;
             contraindications).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Inability to tolerate study procedures at the screening visit.&#xD;
