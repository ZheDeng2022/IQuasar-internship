      Umbilical cord blood is an important source of stem cells and can be used to treat blood and&#xD;
      immune system disorders and certain types of cancer. Stem cell transplants of umbilical cord&#xD;
      blood have been shown to be effective in treating illness in children, but more research is&#xD;
      needed to confirm the benefit of this procedure in adults. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      examine the immune system response to cord blood stem cell transplantation in adults with&#xD;
      advanced blood disorders or cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The use of umbilical cord blood stem cells to treat blood disorders and cancer is an&#xD;
      important medical advance; currently, more than 45 disorders can be treated with this method.&#xD;
      While bone marrow transplants are the most common method for stem cell donations, research&#xD;
      has shown that there are many advantages to using allogeneic grafts of stem cells obtained&#xD;
      from umbilical cord blood. Cord blood stem cells are relatively easy to obtain. Additionally,&#xD;
      a perfect donor match is not necessary, thereby decreasing the likelihood of&#xD;
      graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), a serious side effect in which donor stem cells attack the&#xD;
      recipient's tissues. Cord blood has been used successfully in pediatric patients but its&#xD;
      benefit in adults remains untested. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of umbilical cord blood stem cell transplantation in adults with advanced blood&#xD;
      disorders or cancer. Upon receiving an allogeneic stem cell transplant using umbilical cord&#xD;
      blood, participants will be observed for successful engraftment in which the transplanted&#xD;
      stem cells &quot;take&quot; and begin producing new blood cells. The incidence of GVHD and the overall&#xD;
      immune system's response will also be examined. In turn, these findings may guide future&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood stem cell clinical trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This 1-year study will enroll individuals with advanced blood diseases or cancer.&#xD;
      Participants will receive an allogeneic umbilical cord blood stem cell transplant and will be&#xD;
      closely monitored while in the hospital to determine when engraftment occurs and if GVHD&#xD;
      develops. Study visits will occur at Months 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and Year 1. At each visit,&#xD;
      participants will have blood drawn for laboratory testing and for evaluation of immune system&#xD;
      response. Quality of life questionnaires will also be completed at each visit.&#xD;
