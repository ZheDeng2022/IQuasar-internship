      The aim of this phase III trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with&#xD;
      rituximab in combination with FCM chemotherapy (R-FCM) versus FCM chemotherapy alone for&#xD;
      remission induction and to asses the safety and efficacy of rituximab maintenance versus&#xD;
      observation only after response to induction therapy. Both questions are addressed in way of&#xD;
      a prospective randomized comparison in patients with relapsed FL, MCL and LP lymphoma.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with relapsed centroblastic/centrocytic (FL), centrocytic (MCL)or lymphoplasmacytoid&#xD;
      lymphoma are randomly assigned to either FCM chemotherapy alone or to FCM chemotherapy in&#xD;
      combination with the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody rituximab (R-FCM). FCM chemotherapy will&#xD;
      be given for 4 cycles in intervals of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients assigned to cytoreductive therapy with FCM plus rituximab, the monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody is given as one infusion (375 mg/m2) on the day before the respective FCM course for&#xD;
      a total of four applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four weeks after the end of FCM chemotherapy patients with CR or PR are randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either no further treatment or maintenance therapy with rituximab. Rituximab will be given 4&#xD;
      times (one infusion per week with 375 mg/m2). After six months rituximab treatment will be&#xD;
      repeated with another 4 infusions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of relapse patients will receive an alternative treatment according to the decision&#xD;
      of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this phase III trial is to assess the safety and efficacy of treatment with&#xD;
      rituximab in combination with FCM chemotherapy versus FCM chemotherapy alone for remission&#xD;
      induction and to asses the safety and efficacy of rituximab maintenance versus observation&#xD;
      only after response to induction therapy. Both questions are addressed in way of a&#xD;
      prospective randomized comparison in patients with relapsed FCL, MCL and LP lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives of this trial are to compare (1) the remission rates (CR and PR) achieved&#xD;
      after FCM plus rituximab versus FCM alone and (2) the progression free interval of rituximab&#xD;
      maintenance versus observation only.&#xD;
