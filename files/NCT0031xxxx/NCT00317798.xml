      RATIONALE: Biological therapies, such as antithymocyte globulin may stimulate the immune&#xD;
      system in different ways and stop cancer cells from growing. Sirolimus may stop the growth of&#xD;
      cancer cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. It may also prevent or&#xD;
      reduce the side effects of antithymocyte globulin. Giving antithymocyte globulin together&#xD;
      with sirolimus may kill more cancer cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of antithymocyte&#xD;
      globulin when given together with sirolimus in treating patients with relapsed multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the safety and tolerability, in terms of clinical and laboratory toxicity, of&#xD;
           anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) combined with sirolimus in patients with relapsed multiple&#xD;
           myeloma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the dose-limiting toxicity of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the maximum tolerated dose of ATG when administered with sirolimus in these&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the clinical activity of this regimen, in terms of measurability of&#xD;
           improvement in clinical benefits, in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess patients for sensitivity of CD 138^-positive myeloma cells to ATG prior to&#xD;
           treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine the pharmacokinetics, in terms of ATG levels in blood and bone marrow, in&#xD;
           these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the binding capability of ATG to bone marrow resident myeloma cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine if an ATG-resistant clone emerges after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is an open-label, pilot, dose-escalation study of anti-thymocyte globulin&#xD;
      (ATG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive ATG IV over 6-12 hours for 4, 6, or 8 days and oral sirolimus once daily on&#xD;
      days 1-30 in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohorts of 3-6 patients receive escalating doses of ATG until the maximum tolerated dose&#xD;
      (MTD) is determined. The MTD is defined as the dose preceding that at which 2 of 3 or 2 of 6&#xD;
      patients experience dose-limiting toxicity. At least 6 patients are treated at the MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone marrow aspirates and blood samples are collected at baseline and periodically during&#xD;
      study treatment for drug sensitivity and pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed every 3 weeks for up to 2 months&#xD;
      and then monthly thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROJECTED ACCRUAL: A total of 18 patients will be accrued for this study.&#xD;
