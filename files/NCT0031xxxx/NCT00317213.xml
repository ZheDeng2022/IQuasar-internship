  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It has been shown in rodent models that chronic substance abuse is associated with a&#xD;
      rigidification of cell membrane fluidity due to a change in the membrane&#xD;
      cholesterol/phospholipids ratio. Upon substance withdrawal the membrane undergoes&#xD;
      reequilibration of this ratio, a process resulting both in an acute and a prolonged severe&#xD;
      withdrawal syndrome. MBM has developed a patented,phosphatidic acid-enriched phospholipid&#xD;
      platform (&quot;LIBERTAL&quot;), which is supposed to facilitate the membrane fluidity recovery. The&#xD;
      company has focused on nicotine withdrawal in smoking cessation,as primary target.&#xD;

      A randomized,double-blind, dose-finding,phase IIB study with Libertal has been performed in&#xD;
      493 volunteer smokers, wishing to quit. They were divided into 5 arms: 4 treatment groups of&#xD;
      0.5, 1.0, 2.0 and 4.0g/day respectively, and one placebo, divided BID. Treatment was&#xD;
      administered during one week prior to smoking cessation, then continued during 8 weeks (56&#xD;
      days), followed by another 4 weeks without treatment (up to day 84). The primary endpoint was&#xD;
      complete smoking cessation during at least 28 consecutive days. There were 6 on-site visits&#xD;
      and 4 telephone interviews.&#xD;
