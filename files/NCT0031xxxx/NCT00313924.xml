  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      OAB is a widespread medical problem affecting 6- 30% of the population (both sexes and all&#xD;
      age groups) in Europe1 and 16%2-18%3 of the US and Canadian population. Nevertheless only a&#xD;
      small proportion of this group turns to seek medical help. Once treated, evaluation of&#xD;
      treatment outcome is problematic since outcome measures for success vary widely (i.e.&#xD;
      improvement in number of incontinence episodes, number of urge episodes, change in frequency&#xD;
      and nocturia etc) but do not include measures of patient reported outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OAB Assessment Tool is a self-administered questionnaire (8-question self-filled survey)&#xD;
      primarily intended to identify patients with symptoms of OAB. The same comparable information&#xD;
      could be obtained after a certain treatment period, thus providing accurate and precise&#xD;
      measures of success. It could also offer insight to the changes of the different parameters&#xD;
      that make up the problem. Due to its ease of administration and its high specificity in&#xD;
      assessing OAB, the OAB Assessment Tool seems to be optimal for this objective.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a non-randomised, non-placebo controlled prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We intend to recruit approximately 100 patients that will receive and fill out the&#xD;
      questionnaire before and after medical treatment with detrusitol 4mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol will receive approval of the local ethical committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty general practitioners (GP) will actively participate in the recruitment and treatment&#xD;
      of these patients. After a brief inquiry, patients with urinary complaints will be offered&#xD;
      the option of completing the OAB-V8 questionnaire and to participate in this trial if&#xD;
      eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the patient fills out the OAB-V8 and is found fit for this study, the patient will&#xD;
      receive accurate information regarding the study and will sign an informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of 2 visits, visit 1 pre and visit 2 post-treatment with Detrusitol&#xD;
      4mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomly selected patients will be requested to complete the OAB -V8 questionnaire. Those&#xD;
      with a score &gt;8 points will be eligible for inclusion. They will complete an informed consent&#xD;
      form and will undergo a basic medical history. Patients will then be given treatment with&#xD;
      detrusitol 4mg once daily (a total of 28 tablets). They will also be required to fill out a&#xD;
      voiding/frequency and urgency chart for three days prior to commencing treatment and again&#xD;
      three days before finishing the treatment period (day 25 of the treatment period) to confirm&#xD;
      diagnosis of OAB. Patients will also be asked questions and lab work will be performed to&#xD;
      rule out patients with other Urinary Conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on side effects and a contact number 24/7 for any question or problem that arises&#xD;
      will be provided. After the end of one-month treatment, patients will return for their 2nd&#xD;
      and final visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-eight tablets of Detrusitol 4mg will be provided to every patient. Visit II: Patients&#xD;
      will be evaluated with regard to effect of treatment by completing the OAB-V8 questionnaire&#xD;
      again. On this visit, according to the physicians' professional consideration, satisfied&#xD;
      patients will receive a prescription of Detrusitol 4mg for continuing treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The statistical methods that will be employed will include Chi Square and Fisher exact tests,&#xD;
      and logistic regression (the logistic will be run mainly for covariates such as age, gender&#xD;
      and baseline symptom severity score to predict who achieve a 10 point change in symptom&#xD;
      bother scale. Software utilised will include SAS and JMP.&#xD;
