  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with Fabry disease have an alteration in their genetic material (DNA) which causes a&#xD;
      deficiency of the a-galactosidase A enzyme. Fabrazyme is a drug that helps to breakdown and&#xD;
      remove certain types of fatty substances called &quot;glycolipids.&quot; These glycolipids are normally&#xD;
      present within the body in most cells. In Fabry disease, glycolipids build up in various&#xD;
      tissues such as the liver, kidney, skin, and blood vessels because a-galactosidase A is not&#xD;
      present, or is present in small quantities. The build up of glycolipid (globotriaosylceramide&#xD;
      or GL-3) levels in these tissues in particular is thought to cause the clinical symptoms that&#xD;
      are common to Fabry disease. This study is designed to verify that no loss of Fabrazyme&#xD;
      occurs during simultaneous Fabrazyme infusion and hemodialysis in patients currently&#xD;
      receiving Fabrazyme at a dose of 1.0 mg/kg every 2 weeks.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient must provide signed, written informed consent prior to any study-related&#xD;
             procedures being performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is between 18 and 65 years of age, inclusive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has documented Fabry disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has received bi-weekly 1 mg/kg infusions of Fabrazyme for at least 6 months&#xD;
             prior to enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has not experienced moderate or severe infusion-associated reactions (IARs)&#xD;
             from Fabrazyme infusions, which were also associated with a rate reduction, within 3&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has been receiving chronic hemodialysis for treatment of end-stage renal&#xD;
             insufficiency for at least 3 months prior to enrollment into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has good vascular access for hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has not and will not have any other (investigational) drug(s) infused during&#xD;
             their hemodialysis, and is expected to have a stable concomitant medication regimen at&#xD;
             all PK assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient's hemoglobin is &lt; 9 g/100 mL at Screening/Baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a clinically significant organic disease or an unstable condition that, in&#xD;
             the opinion of the Investigator, would preclude participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has a medical condition, serious intercurrent illness, or extenuating&#xD;
             circumstance that would significantly decrease study compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient has participated in a study employing an investigational drug within 30 days&#xD;
             prior to the start of their participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient is unwilling to comply with the requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
