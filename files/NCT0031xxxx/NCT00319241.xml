    <textblock>
      In this Stage II study, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial of the Relational&#xD;
      Parenting Mothers' Group (RPMG), an intervention designed for opioid abusing mothers with&#xD;
      children between the ages of 7 and 14 which was manualized and tested as part of a Stage I&#xD;
      study (NIDA # P50-DA09241; September 1, 1994- August 31, 1997). This intervention was&#xD;
      developed in recognition of the substantial psychosocial risks faced by substance abusing&#xD;
      mothers and their offspring, and the notable lack of parenting interventions currently&#xD;
      available for addicted mothers with children past the preschool years. Based on developmental&#xD;
      psychopathology perspectives on resilience, this integrative treatment addresses multiple&#xD;
      levels of adversity (individual, family, and community) faced by addicted mothers: risks that&#xD;
      typically result in negative parenting behaviors and psychosocial distress among the mothers&#xD;
      and concomitantly, psychiatric disturbance among their offspring. Designed as a supplement to&#xD;
      standard drug counseling, RPMG is a structured and time-limited treatment, entailing 24&#xD;
      weekly group sessions of 1Â½ hours each.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data collected in the Stage I pilot study have attested to the promise of RPMG in&#xD;
      terms of diverse parenting behaviors and psychiatric outcomes among both mothers and their&#xD;
      children. In the proposed study, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial in which mothers&#xD;
      receiving RPMG as a supplement to Recovery Training (RT, a manualized group intervention&#xD;
      representing standard drug counseling offered in methadone clinics) will be compared with&#xD;
      those who receive RT alone. The RPMG clinical team will include one masters/doctoral level&#xD;
      therapist and one assistant therapist and RT groups will be conducted by drug counselors; all&#xD;
      therapists (RPMG &amp; RT) will be trained and supervised by our research team. One hundred sixty&#xD;
      mothers will be randomized to one of the two treatment conditions. Multiple-method,&#xD;
      multiple-informant assessments will be used to measure salient outcomes; these will include&#xD;
      reports from mothers and their children, and from the mothers' clinicians and their&#xD;
      children's teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will address the following specific aims in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will evaluate the effectiveness of the Relational Parenting Mother's Group (RPMG) as&#xD;
           a supplement to Recovery Training (RT) vs. Recovery Training alone in terms of a)&#xD;
           mothers' parenting behaviors, b) their psychosocial adjustment, c) their children's&#xD;
           psychosocial adjustment, and d) mothers' treatment compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. We will evaluate the comparative durability of RPMG+RT vs. RT in terms of the outcomes&#xD;
           in Aim #1, and in terms of delayed improvement in frequency of illicit drug use,&#xD;
           HIV-risk behaviors, and other problems related to drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. We will examine how specific maternal characteristics interact with treatment to affect&#xD;
           outcomes. Guided by previous research, these characteristics will include mothers'&#xD;
           intelligence, readiness for change, and sensation seeking.&#xD;
