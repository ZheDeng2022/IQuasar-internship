      The purpose of this research study to test the effectiveness of a study medication to&#xD;
      increase how fast a solution called lactated Ringer's is absorbed when put under the skin&#xD;
      subcutaneously. The medication to be studied is an enzyme called hyaluronidase, and is a&#xD;
      human recombinant form of the enzyme. The drug company name for this medication is Hylenex.&#xD;
      Hylenex was currently an investigational medication at the initiation of the study, but&#xD;
      received FDA approval during the study. An investigational medication is a medication or&#xD;
      formulation of a medication that is not approved by the United States Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration for use in this country but may be used in studies such as this one.&#xD;

      The study will be conducted in two sequential stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Preliminary assessment of mean flow rate and its inter-subject variability, and a&#xD;
      comparison to IV infusion. Each subject will receive a SC infusion of 400 mL (from a 0.5 L&#xD;
      bag) of Ringer's lactate solution in each upper arm, followed by one IV infusion of 400 mL of&#xD;
      Ringer's lactate solution (from a 0.5 L bag). The SC injection sites will be randomized in a&#xD;
      double-blinded fashion to receive either 150 units Hylenex or an equal volume of saline&#xD;
      placebo injected into a Y-port in the tubing just above the catheter immediately prior to&#xD;
      infusion. 24-gauge angiocatheters will be placed symmetrically in the SC space in both&#xD;
      proximal upper extremities at the lateral aspect, midline halfway between the olecranon&#xD;
      process and the inferoposterior aspect of the acromion, introduced at a 30-degree angle. A&#xD;
      24-gauge angiocatheter will also be placed in a vein in either the left or right forearm (per&#xD;
      randomization). In each upper arm, Ringer's lactate solution will be infused SC by gravity&#xD;
      (wide open) by placing the top of the fluid in a 0.5 liter bag at a height of 100 cm above&#xD;
      the respective angiocatheter sites. After completion of both SC infusions, Ringer's lactate&#xD;
      solution will be infused IV by gravity (wide open) by placing the top of the fluid in a 0.5&#xD;
      liter bag at a height of 100 cm above the angiocatheter sites. The flow rate observations in&#xD;
      Stage 1 will be used to either confirm or adjust the proposed sample size for Stage 2, if&#xD;
      such adjustment is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: Dose-comparison assessment of rate of flow over the range of 150 to 1,500 units of&#xD;
      Hylenex. Each subject will receive a SC infusion of 400 mL (from a 0.5 L bag) of Ringer's&#xD;
      lactate solution in each upper arm. The SC injection sites will be randomized in a&#xD;
      double-blinded fashion to either Hylenex or an equal volume of saline solution injected into&#xD;
      a Y-port in the tubing just above the catheter immediately prior to infusion. 24-gauge&#xD;
      angiocatheters will be placed symmetrically in the SC space in both proximal upper&#xD;
      extremities at the lateral aspect, midline halfway between the olecranon process and the&#xD;
      inferoposterior aspect of the acromion, introduced at a 30-degree angle. In each arm,&#xD;
      Ringer's lactate solution will be infused SC by gravity (wide open) by placing the top of the&#xD;
      fluid in a 0.5 liter bag at a height of 100 cm above the respective catheter sites. Subjects&#xD;
      will be dosed in either two or three sequential cohorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 3, at 750 U, to be conducted ONLY if flow rate for Cohort 2 is at least 20% faster&#xD;
      than for Cohort 1 without unacceptable toxicity in Cohort 1, or unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
      observed in Cohort 2 and not Cohort&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each stage, safety and tolerability will be assessed through physical examination targeted&#xD;
      at infusion sites and volume status assessment, vital signs, and adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medications Hylenex recombinant (hyaluronidase human injection); rHuPH20 (Hylenex is a&#xD;
      registered trademark of Baxter International, Inc. or its subsidiaries)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: In both stages of the study, subjects who are successfully screened for the study&#xD;
      will receive a single, one-day session of study drug administration followed by parenteral&#xD;
      infusions, and then undergo follow-up evaluations at 1 day (in clinic) and 28 days (by&#xD;
      telephone) after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Population: Normal volunteers satisfying all entry criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Planned Total Sample Size: Considering both stages, no more than a total of 70 subjects may&#xD;
      be enrolled in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 1: Five evaluable subjects will be enrolled. It is anticipated that no more than a&#xD;
      total of 10 subjects will need to be enrolled to provide 5 evaluable subjects. An evaluable&#xD;
      subject is one who completes all 3 parenteral infusions. Subjects not meeting this criterion,&#xD;
      including those withdrawn prematurely for reasons other than toxicity, will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 2: 15 evaluable subjects per cohort will be enrolled. An evaluable subject is one who&#xD;
      has completed both SC infusions and has completed protocol-specified assessments sufficient&#xD;
      for determination of safety and tolerability. Subjects not meeting these criteria, including&#xD;
      those withdrawn prematurely for reasons other than toxicity, will be replaced. Enrollment of&#xD;
      Cohort 3 is dependent on findings in Cohorts 1 and 2. Allowing for some non-evaluable&#xD;
      subjects in up to three cohorts, each including 15 evaluable subjects, a total of up to 60&#xD;
      subjects may be entered in this Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping Rules: Safety monitoring of enrolled subjects will be ongoing and continuous. If&#xD;
      signs or symptoms of unacceptable fluid overload occur, the subject will be withdrawn.&#xD;
