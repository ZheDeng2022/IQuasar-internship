    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if improvements in mood will ameliorate autonomic&#xD;
      dysregulation, HPA dysfunction and typical (e.g. lipids) and atypical risk factors in&#xD;
      depressed patients with elevated cardiovascular risk (CVD). Up to 70, depressed participants&#xD;
      with elevated cardiovascular risk factors were randomized to a cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      intervention (CBT) or a waiting list control (WLC) condition. Twenty non-depressed age and&#xD;
      risk-matched controls will also recruited. Traditional risk factors (e.g. lipids, blood&#xD;
      pressure, heart rate), atypical risk factors (endothelial function, asymmetric&#xD;
      dimethylarginine, C-reactive protein) will be measured pre and post treatment six months&#xD;
      later Subjects will undergo a psychophysiological stress test while cardiovascular physiology&#xD;
      was measured. Salivary cortisol will be measured during the day and during the psychological&#xD;
      stress test. Depressed subjects will be randomized to a 16 week cognitive behavior therapy&#xD;
      intervention or to a wait-list control. It is hypothesized that reduction in mood will be&#xD;
      associated with reduction in typical and atypical risk factors.&#xD;

      Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will be drawn from the following Stanford Health Services clinics: the Stanford&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Risk Reduction Clinic, the Electron Beam Computed Tomography Center, and the&#xD;
      Cardiology Clinics. Subjects will also be recruited via the mass media.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screen:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential subjects will be identified by a brief screen combined with a short follow-up&#xD;
      interview, the PRIME-MD that consists of two self-report items, as follows: &quot;During the PAST&#xD;
      MONTH, have you been bothered A LOT by (1) little interest or pleasure in doing things (yes&#xD;
      or no) or (2) feeling down, depressed, or hopeless (yes or no).&quot; If either item is scored&#xD;
      &quot;yes,&quot; a short follow-up interview to establish a diagnosis is indicated. The two screen&#xD;
      items yield a sensitivity of 69% and specificity of 82% when diagnoses made by a mental&#xD;
      health professional are used as the criterion standard. Subjects will also have to have a&#xD;
      general health questionnaire score &gt; 5, indicating high levels of distress. Potentially&#xD;
      eligible subjects will then undergo a structured clinical interview for diagnosis. Twenty,&#xD;
      age, gender and cardiovascular risk level controls will be selected from the same population.&#xD;
      Controls will be matched for age, sex and risk with the depressed subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will come to the Department of Psychiatry for baseline assessment, including&#xD;
      undergoing a structured psychiatric examination and completing baseline self-report measures.&#xD;
      If they are interested and eligible they will be asked to complete a series of assessments&#xD;
      that will last three days. On day one, they will then be asked to report to the Stanford&#xD;
      General Research Center on their next available Wednesday, at 9:00. At that time a medical&#xD;
      exam will be performed, bloods were will be drawn and the FMVD (see below) undertaken. They&#xD;
      will then be asked to wear a the &quot;lifeshirt,&quot; a undergarment worn over the chest that will&#xD;
      measure heart rate during the day, and to report their mood and activity on up to 5&#xD;
      occassions using a portable computer attached to the lifeshirt. Each participant will be&#xD;
      scheduled to obtain saliva samples using cotton swabs in &quot;salivette devices&quot; at the time of&#xD;
      waking, 30 minutes later, and then at 1200h, 1700h, and 2100h on each of two days.&#xD;
      Participants were asked to refrigerate each sample immediately after collection, not to eat,&#xD;
      drink, smoke, brush their teeth, or use mouthwash in the 30 minutes before collection, and&#xD;
      not to drink alcohol during the 8-10 hours prior to collecting samples or during the days of&#xD;
      collection. On day two they will return the life-shirt and continue to obtain salivary&#xD;
      cortisols. On day three they will be asked to return to the Stanford GCRC to undertaken a&#xD;
      psychological stress test. The psychological stress test is a standardized social and&#xD;
      cognitive stressor composed of 5 minutes of anticipatory stress, and then 5 minutes of public&#xD;
      speaking (simulated job interview) and 5 minutes of mental arithmetic, both done before a&#xD;
      panel of 2 evaluators. Subjects were sitting in a comfortable chair throughout the entire&#xD;
      procedure. Subjects were informed that their speech would be evaluated by a panel of two&#xD;
      expert behavioral coders and that it would be rated on the basis of poise, speaking ability,&#xD;
      and expressiveness. During the psychological stress a number of physiologic functions will be&#xD;
      measured using sensors attached to the chest and arms. Subjects will also be asked to provide&#xD;
      saliva samples between the measurements and to report their mood. At the end of the stress&#xD;
      testing they will meet with an investigator to be debriefed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depressed subjects randomized to the cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)will be asked to attend&#xD;
      16, one-hour sessions over 4-5 months. The CBT will be conduced by a senior therapist.&#xD;
      Cognitive therapy aims at symptom removal by identification and correction of the patient's&#xD;
      distorted, negatively biased, moment-to-moment thinking and theoretically aims at prevention&#xD;
      of relapse/reoccurrence by identifying and correcting silent assumptions (personal beliefs or&#xD;
      schemas). Modern cognitive treatment interventions also address behavioral aspects of&#xD;
      depression through encouraging more activity of various kinds. (Because the level of physical&#xD;
      condition is a potential confound for the variables of interest, increased aerobic activity&#xD;
      will not be included in the intervention.) Depressed control subjects will be offered the CBT&#xD;
      intervention (in a group format) after the six-month follow-up and/or referred for treatment,&#xD;
      as desired and appropriate. At post-treatment and six-month follow-up, subjects will be&#xD;
      carefully assessed for any psychotherapy and psychopharmacology interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same assessments will be conducted at baseline and six months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention Descriptive and Control Variables: Baseline demographic information will include&#xD;
      education, ethnicity and marital status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnosis (SCID). A structured clinical interview for&#xD;
      diagnosis modified to include the Hamilton Depression Interview will be used. Structured&#xD;
      clinical interviews are now the standard method of diagnosis in psychiatry studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical status. A standard questionnaire concerning coronary risk factors, medications, and&#xD;
      medical diagnosis will be completed at baseline on all subjects. Heart rate and baseline ECG.&#xD;
      Resting 12-lead ECG will be recorded using a standard electrocardiograph at the time of the&#xD;
      treadmill. Subjects with CVD events evident on their ECG will be excluded. Blood pressure.&#xD;
      Resting blood pressure will be measured in triplicate by asculatory techniques using a&#xD;
      mercury sphygmomanometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight (kg) and height (m). Weight (in kgs) will be measured on a balance beam scale.&#xD;
      Height and weight will be obtained in a standing position, with shoes removed and subjects&#xD;
      wearing street clothes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipids and apolipoproteins. Fasting plasma levels of total cholesterol and triglycerides will&#xD;
      be obtained from fasting samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duplex ultrasonography of flow-mediated vasodilation (FMVD). The methods are as follows:&#xD;
      Diameter of the brachial arterial (DBA) will be measured at multiple single time points under&#xD;
      4 states using a standard 7 MHz linear array transducer and a Hewlett-Packard system&#xD;
      (Hewlett-Packard, Palo Alto, California). The four states include: at rest, during limb&#xD;
      ischemia (created by inflating a blood pressure cuff placed distal to the brachial artery to&#xD;
      supra-systemic pressures), in response to reactive hyperemia (with increased flow producing&#xD;
      endothelium-dependent vasodilation). Measurements of these three states will then be repeated&#xD;
      a second time. Finally, DBA will then be measured in (4) response to the administration of&#xD;
      sublingual nitroglycerin. ADMA (asymmetric dimethylarginine) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis Activity Cortisol and diurnal cortisol variation.&#xD;
      Cortisol will be measured using self-administered saliva samples. Subjects will obtain&#xD;
      samples on three consecutive days, at five intervals throughout each day (at waking, 45&#xD;
      minutes later, 5 pm, 9 pm and bedtime), in subjects' own homes. A testing kit will be used by&#xD;
      each subject consisting of 15 salivette tubes. Salivary cortisol has been found to be a&#xD;
      reliable tool for investigations of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Assessment of RSA and Baroreflex Sensitivity RSA and baroreflex sensitivity will&#xD;
      be assessed noninvasively in the laboratory during a 10-minute baseline. Physiological&#xD;
      channels required for their quantification will be recorded using (1) an ECG (400 Hz sample&#xD;
      rate); (2) two channels of respiration using a Respitrace system (Ambulatory Monitoring,&#xD;
      Ardsley, NY); bands are placed around the upper thorax and around the abdomen and calibrated&#xD;
      against spirometry (25 Hz sample rate); (3) a continuous arterial blood pressure waveform&#xD;
      from the index finger by means of the Finapres 2300 system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression measures include the Hamilton Depression Interview (HDI) and the Beck Depression&#xD;
      Interview (BDI), a short 21-item will also be obrtained. Perceived Stress Perceived Stress&#xD;
      Scale (PSS). The PSS measures a global perception of stress during the previous month. It has&#xD;
      a short version comprised of ten items, e.g., &quot;In the last month how often have you felt&#xD;
      difficulties were piling up so high that you could not overcome them?&quot; Response options were&#xD;
      assessed using a 5-point Likert-type scale: (0 = Never to 4= Very Often). The scores on four&#xD;
      items that were worded in the opposite direction (e.g., &quot;In the last month how often have you&#xD;
      felt that things were going your way?&quot;) are reverse-scored.&#xD;
