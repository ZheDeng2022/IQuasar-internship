    <textblock>
      This study will explore the growth of dermal neurofibromas (skin tumors) in patients with&#xD;
      neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1). Investigators will try to learn: 1) how fast (or slow) these&#xD;
      benign tumors grow in NF1, 2) how often new tumors appear and 3) what genes are involved in&#xD;
      the growth of the tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men and women between 20 and 50 years of age diagnosed with NF1 and their biological parents&#xD;
      are eligible for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NF1 are evaluated at the NIH Clinical Center with the following tests and&#xD;
      procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical examination and drawing of family tree.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photos of the back, abdomen and thigh in order to count the number of skin tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photos of the skin taken with a special camera (Primos camera) that takes very detailed&#xD;
           pictures of a small area of skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Photos of the skin taken with a dermatoscope, which takes very detailed pictures of a&#xD;
           small area of skin under high magnification.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biopsy of at least one skin tumor and biopsy of a small piece of normal skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample collection for genetic testing of the gene NF1 and to establish a cell&#xD;
           line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other medical tests (e.g., x-rays or MRI) if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and their families will also have a genetic counseling session and an opportunity to&#xD;
      ask questions about neurofibromatosis type 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients return to the NIH after 3, 6, 12, 18 and 24 months for follow-up photographs and&#xD;
      possibly blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological parents of patients provide a blood sample for genetic testing.&#xD;

      This protocol results from a funded 2005 Bench-to-Bedside Award and explores the genetic&#xD;
      basis of disease severity in neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and the evaluation of three&#xD;
      methods to measure disease progression of dermal neurofibromas. NF1 is a common multisystem&#xD;
      genetic disorder associated with the development of benign and malignant tumors, primarily of&#xD;
      the nervous system. NF1 is 100% penetrant and features variable expressivity and limited&#xD;
      phenotype/genotype correlation. No standard treatment other than surgery exists for most&#xD;
      NF1-associated tumors. Many aspects of the natural history of NF1-associated tumors are not&#xD;
      fully characterized and require investigation to assess the effects of potential new&#xD;
      treatments, in future clinical trials. The development of medical treatments for&#xD;
      NF1-associated tumors is an important goal given their morbidity and the lack of non-surgical&#xD;
      treatment options. The ability to predict the ultimate severity of disease would have a&#xD;
      significant impact on the management and treatment of individuals with NF1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sorafenib (BAY 43-9006) is a novel, orally bioavailable agent that targets downstream&#xD;
      effectors in the Ras signaling pathway (a key dysregulated pathway in NF1). It has thus a&#xD;
      strong scientific rationale for evaluation in NF1 related tumors. Dermal neurofibromas occur&#xD;
      in nearly every individual with NF1, and are a significant cosmetic problem and a major cause&#xD;
      of morbidity. This protocol will 1) quantify the growth of dermal neurofibromas in NF1 with 3&#xD;
      different imaging modalities 2) use an innovative gene expression method to identify genetic&#xD;
      modifiers of dermal neurofibroma burden, and 3) evaluate dermal neurofibromas and normal skin&#xD;
      for the presence of targets of sorafenib. Successful validation of reliable quantitative&#xD;
      imaging methods of dermal neurofibroma growth is a logical prerequisite to subsequent&#xD;
      clinical trials with medical treatments, which will evaluate the effect of new agents on the&#xD;
      growth rate of dermal neurofibromas. Identification of genetic modifiers may permit&#xD;
      prediction of ultimate tumor burden. Evaluation of targets of new agents in dermal&#xD;
      neurofibromas will allow for more rationale drug development for NF1. Given the paucity of&#xD;
      protocols for adults with NF1 and dermal neurofibromas, this study will likely generate great&#xD;
      interest among affected individuals and have rapid accrual.&#xD;

        -INCLUSION CRITERIA - GROUP A INDIVIDUALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical diagnosis of NF1. In order to meet the diagnosis of NF1 individuals must have&#xD;
             2 of the diagnostic criteria listed below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Six or more cafe-au-lait macules (greater than or equal to 0.5 cm in prepubertal&#xD;
                  subjects or greater than or equal to 1.5 cm in postpubertal subjects)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Freckling in the axilla or groin&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A tumor of the optic pathway&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Two or more Lisch nodules&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A distinctive bony lesion (dysplasia of the sphenoid bone or dysplasia or&#xD;
                  thinning of long bone cortex)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A plexiform neurofibroma or two or more neurofibromas&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A first-degree relative with NF1 by the above criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             We may request the medical records of potential enrollees for our review. Ideally,&#xD;
             individuals will have been evaluated by a geneticist and a definitive diagnosis made.&#xD;
             However given the unique, familial (and often unmistakable features) of NF1 it is&#xD;
             likely the diagnosis can be reliably made by a non-geneticist.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age at study entry: 20- 50 years (inclusive)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Identification of a physician who will be responsible for follow-up care, if needed&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ability and willingness to travel to the NIH Clinical Center or University of Alabama&#xD;
             at Birmingham Alabama for multiple evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Ability and willingness of both biologic parents to provide a blood (or saliva) sample&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Must have at least one dermal neurofibroma amenable to excisional biopsy. Preferably&#xD;
             the neurofibroma will be on the thorax or abdomen and be at least the size of a pencil&#xD;
             eraser.&#xD;
&#xD;
        INCLUSION CRITERIA - GROUP B INDIVIDUALS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Biological parents (either affected or unaffected) of Group A individuals&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willingness to donate a blood or saliva sample for genotyping&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willing to undergo a brief skin and eye exam at the NIH CC (to rule out NF1) or&#xD;
             University of Alabama, if accompanying adult children&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA - GROUP A INDIVIDUALS&#xD;
&#xD;
        MEDICAL INCLUSIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any history of administration (or current use) of radiation therapy, chemotherapeutic&#xD;
             agents or biologic agents (experimental or not) that resulted in a documented&#xD;
             significant change in dermal neurofibroma tumor burden or growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients with probable segmental or mosaic NF1 will be excluded from study&#xD;
             participation and medical records may be reviewed prior to enrollment for this&#xD;
             determination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. A history of administration of medications within 6 months of study entry that might&#xD;
             reasonably be expected to alter the natural history of tumor growth (examples include&#xD;
             pirfenidone, interferon, farnesyl transferase inhibitor (FTI), MTX/VBL, thalidomide,&#xD;
             growth hormone) or cause significant changes in gene expression profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known or suspected untreated bleeding diathesis or platelet disorder that would&#xD;
             preclude safe and successful dermal neurofibroma and skin biopsy. Patients prescribed&#xD;
             aspirin or other known/suspected agent that interferes with platelet function may also&#xD;
             be excluded if they cannot safely discontinue its use a week ahead of the biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinically significant unrelated systemic illness, such as serious infection, hepatic,&#xD;
             renal or other organ dysfunction, which in the judgment of the principal investigator&#xD;
             or associate investigator would compromise the patient's ability to participate in the&#xD;
             study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Inability or unwillingness to tolerate the dermal neurofibroma excision and skin&#xD;
             biopsy or blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
        VULNERABLE POPULATIONS EXCLUSIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1) Cognitive delay to the extent that conscious sedation is required to obtain the dermal&#xD;
        neurofibroma excision and skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        OTHER EXCLUSIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Biologic parents unable or unwilling to provide a blood (or saliva) sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Inability to travel to the NIH or to The University of Alabama at Birmingham, AL&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Individuals refusing an excisional tumor or skin biopsy.&#xD;
