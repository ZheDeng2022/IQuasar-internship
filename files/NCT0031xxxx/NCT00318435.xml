  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The type of hemodialysis access and preservation of this access greatly influences the&#xD;
      quality of life and survival of patients undergoing hemodialysis. The Kidney Disease Outcomes&#xD;
      Quality Initiative (K/DOQI) guidelines for vascular access recommend the primary placement of&#xD;
      native or autogenous hemodialysis fistulas in preference to polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE)&#xD;
      grafts and central venous catheters because the former form of access has fewer complications&#xD;
      and a longer durability. However, autogenous hemodialysis fistulas, like&#xD;
      polytetrafluoroethylene grafts, are also subject to dysfunction and eventual failure.&#xD;
      Endovascular angioplasty has become an accepted alternative treatment to surgical revision&#xD;
      for hemodialysis access-related venous stenoses and occlusions. However, the patency rates in&#xD;
      the follow-up period are low because of the high frequency of restenosis due to intimal&#xD;
      hyperplasia. Since 1988, noncovered stents have been used to improve fistula patency. In the&#xD;
      central veins, bare stents demonstrate better patency rates than percutaneous transluminal&#xD;
      angioplasty (PTA) alone. Neointimal hyperplasia is the major reason for restenosis following&#xD;
      stent placement. The cephalic vein forms the outflow conduit for radiocephalic and&#xD;
      brachiocephalic autogenous fistulas. It has recently been suggested that a focal area of the&#xD;
      cephalic vein is prone to developing hemodynamically significant stenosis, in what is now&#xD;
      termed the cephalic arch. This is the perpendicular portion of the cephalic vein in the&#xD;
      region of the deltopectoral groove before its junction with the axillary vein. To overcome&#xD;
      the problem of restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia in the cephalic arch the investigators&#xD;
      used the insertion of a stent-graft as an alternative approach. In this study they&#xD;
      investigated the use of a PTFE-covered nitinol stent-graft (Fluency, Bard) versus a Luminex&#xD;
      (Bard) stent.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients included in this study would be presented for intervention after observation&#xD;
             in the Vascular Access Unit for one of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  the recurrent cephalic arch stenosis identified on periodic duplex scanning,&#xD;
                  performed by one of the surgeons from the Vascular Access Unit;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  reduction of flow rate of more than 20% from baseline access flow rate;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  dynamic venous pressures exceeded threshold levels three consecutive times; or&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  clinical signs (arm swelling, pulsatile fistula, prolonged bleeding from puncture&#xD;
                  sites) suggesting fistula dysfunction in a patient with previously treated&#xD;
                  cephalic arch stenosis.&#xD;
