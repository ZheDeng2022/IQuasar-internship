      The hypothesis is that community-acquired pneumonia is usually a monomicrobial infection.&#xD;
      Therefore, early detection of the etiology allows to select the most active, narrow-spectrum,&#xD;
      and cheap, and less toxic antibiotic agent.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In community-acquired pneumonia, identification of the etiologic agent has theoretically&#xD;
      important advantages. For individual patients, it facilitates the administration of a&#xD;
      targeted, narrow-spectrum antibiotic therapy that may improve the efficacy of treatment, and&#xD;
      reduces risks of antibiotic-related toxicity. For the community, microbiologic results&#xD;
      contribute to understanding the local microbial epidemiology of community-acquired pneumonia&#xD;
      and the antimicrobial resistance patterns of pathogens, information that is essential in the&#xD;
      instauration or modification of empiric treatment regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines recommend that all admitted patients with community-acquired pneumonia should have&#xD;
      a collection of two sets of blood cultures, a good quality sputum sample for Gram stain and&#xD;
      culture, a sample of pleural fuid if present and, for severe patients, an urine sample for&#xD;
      antigen detection. In contrast, several prospective studies (usually without include urinary&#xD;
      tests) concluded that these microbiological studies have limited value in the management of&#xD;
      patients admitted with community-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, microbiological studies could provide erroneous or incomplete information. Thus,&#xD;
      investigations has showed false-positive results from pneumococcal antigen detection in urine&#xD;
      caused by a frequent persistence of positivity after infection or a nasopharyngeal or&#xD;
      bronchial colonization. Other authors suggested that community-acquired pneumonia is a&#xD;
      polymicrobial infection; consequently, despite the detection of a true microorganism,&#xD;
      treatment needs to be also addressed against other potential pathogenic agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the study is to assess the clinical and the economic derived from the initial&#xD;
      microbiological studies, including antigen detection tests in urine for Streptococcus&#xD;
      pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila, in patients with community-acquired pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that community-acquired pneumonia is usually a monomicrobial infection.&#xD;
      Therefore, early detection of the etiology allows to select the most active, narrow-spectrum,&#xD;
      and cheap, and less toxic antibiotic agent.&#xD;
