  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a syndrome caused by a genetic mutation that causes a&#xD;
      specific protein in the body called a G protein to be constantly active. Children with&#xD;
      McCune-Albright syndrome classically have early puberty, areas of increased skin&#xD;
      pigmentation, and bone lesions resulting from the constant activity of the specific protein&#xD;
      involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histamines are known to play a role in allergies and related allergic problems. The effects&#xD;
      of histamines are controlled by the same G protein that is overly active in McCune-Albright&#xD;
      syndrome. Thus, one could predict that patients with McCune-Albright may be at high risk for&#xD;
      allergic problems. To date, no studies have documented any form of histamine excess or&#xD;
      allergic difficulties in patients with McCune-Albright syndrome. However, the investigators&#xD;
      have made the observation that a high percentage of their patients with MAS exhibit a range&#xD;
      of allergic symptoms, from mild symptoms, to severe, life-threatening symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate increased histamine response by using a histamine&#xD;
      skin test in patients with MAS. If increased reactions to histamines can be documented in MAS&#xD;
      patients when compared to controls, severe and potentially life threatening allergic&#xD;
      reactions in children with MAS could be anticipated and avoided.&#xD;

      Objectives of this study are to determine if:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with McCune-Albright syndrome differ from unaffected controls in wheal and&#xD;
           flare response to histamine and codeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Affected skin will differ from unaffected skin in wheal and flare response to histamine&#xD;
           and codeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. IgE and IL-4 levels in MAS patients differ from normal controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Compare the skin response of MAS patients to normal controls using standard histamine&#xD;
           and codeine skin testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Compare skin testing response in MAS patients with known standards for skin testing.&#xD;
           Compare response to histamine and codeine skin testing in MAS patient's affected&#xD;
           (café-au-lait) skin to unaffected (normal) skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Compare IgE and IL-4 levels in patients with MAS to controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The McCune-Albright syndrome (MAS) is a genetic disorder characterized by constitutive&#xD;
      activation of the Gαs proteins involved in the adenylyl cyclase enzyme. The disease is now&#xD;
      known to be caused by a genetic mutation, commonly a substitution of histadine or cysteine&#xD;
      for arginine at amino acid 201 in the Gαs protein. Adenylyl cyclase, with its formation of&#xD;
      cyclic AMP (cAMP), works as a second messenger for many cellular and hormonal events.&#xD;
      Clinically, MAS is characterized classically by precocious puberty, café-au-lait skin&#xD;
      markings, and bone lesions termed polyostotic fibrous dysplasia. Other conditions that&#xD;
      represent overactivity of receptor-coupled adenylate cyclase include hyperthyroidism&#xD;
      resulting from activation of the TSH receptor, hypercortisolism (CRH and ACTH receptor&#xD;
      activation), acromegaly (GHRH receptor activation), among others. Clinical heterozygosity of&#xD;
      affected individuals is explained by mosaicism of the mutation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The H2 histamine receptor is also coupled to the Gαs protein. Release of histamine from mast&#xD;
      cells is primarily responsible for immediate hypersensitivity reaction in the skin. Clinical&#xD;
      observations of our patients with MAS suggest increased responsiveness to histamine. We&#xD;
      speculate that this results from upregulation of Gαs coupled to H2 receptor. In our&#xD;
      identified patients, this has been manifested as asthma, chronic hives, dermatographism,&#xD;
      contact hypersensitivities, drug reactions, ulcers, as well as anaphylactic reactions to&#xD;
      seafood, dyes, and latex. Approximately 75% of our patients with MAS exhibit one or more of&#xD;
      the aforementioned reactions. Anaphylaxis has occurred in three separate patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interleukin-4 (IL-4) is also released from immune cells in response to histamine. This&#xD;
      cytokine response is mediated by H2 receptor activation and activation of Gαs. IL-4 is&#xD;
      required for function and production of IgE, another important mediator of hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions. Two of our MAS patients with allergy symptoms have additionally demonstrated&#xD;
      markedly elevated IgE levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Codeine is a very effective agent in causing release of histamine from mast cells and is&#xD;
      commonly used in addition to histamine. We plan to use codeine as well as histamine skin&#xD;
      testing to evaluate histamine response. Comparison of codeine responses between the MAS&#xD;
      patients and unaffected controls will be made. Age and sex do not exert major effects on&#xD;
      histamine responsiveness. Only infants and adults over the age of 50 have been noted to have&#xD;
      decreased responsiveness in comparison to other age groups. Menstrual cycles in females have&#xD;
      been noted to cause slight variation with increased dermal reactivity around ovulation and&#xD;
      lower reactivity during the menses. Because most girls with McCune-Albright have irregular&#xD;
      menses it will be difficult to time skin testing with the menstrual cycle. Therefore, we will&#xD;
      record the date of last menstrual period for each female patient and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive histamine responsiveness has not been a reported association of the MAS complex.&#xD;
      Even though data are available, MAS patients could be predicted to be at risk for vigorous&#xD;
      histamine response, because histamine acts via Gαs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single center controlled study of histamine response in children with MAS&#xD;
      compared to unaffected subjects. No investigational drug/device/biologic agent will be&#xD;
      employed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject Selection Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Expected sample size: 10 McCune-Albright patients and 20 controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients will be recruited for the study during endocrinology clinic visits. Most&#xD;
           patients with MAS are seen at least every 6 months. Families of patients with MAS tend&#xD;
           to be medically sophisticated, as MAS can be a severe, chronic, multisystem disease. We&#xD;
           estimate that at least 80% of our 13-14 known patients will consent to participate. A&#xD;
           control group will also be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Inclusion criteria: Children with MAS ranging from toddlers to young adults. Diagnosis&#xD;
           of MAS will be made on a clinical basis. Blood testing is not helpful in this condition,&#xD;
           as bone marrow progenitor cells with the Gαs mutation display a survival disadvantage.&#xD;
           All patients are mixed chimeras, as this mutation is lethal if it occurs in germline&#xD;
           cells. Patients who exhibit two or more of the following clinical findings fit the&#xD;
           diagnosis of MAS:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. GnRH independent precocious puberty&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Polyostotic fibrous dysplasia&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Café-au-lait spots with Coast of Maine borders and respect for the midline.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Non-autoimmune hyperthyroidism. Ten controls will also be recruited from family&#xD;
                members of patients with MAS with no known allergies. An additional control group&#xD;
                of ten unrelated subjects, also with no known allergies, will be recruited from the&#xD;
                Endocrine Clinic for comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Any MAS patient or control who has not or cannot discontinue any home regimens of&#xD;
                antihistamines or glucocorticoids (including inhaled steroids) at least seven days&#xD;
                prior to skin testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Any MAS patient or control on tricyclic antidepressants within two weeks prior to&#xD;
                skin testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      No specific treatment is being investigated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations/Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to have discontinued any usual home regimens of antihistamines and/or&#xD;
      glucocorticoids for seven days prior to skin testing. First each participant will undergo a&#xD;
      single blood draw to obtain levels of IgE and IL-4. We will utilize commercially available&#xD;
      ELISA kits for human IL-4. We have published extensively using ELISA methods. Quantitative&#xD;
      IgE levels will be performed in our lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with MAS and controls will undergo standard pin-prick skin testing procedures with&#xD;
      dilutions of histamine, codeine, and a saline control solution to assess skin wheal and flare&#xD;
      response in order to objectively assess hypersensitivity and/or responsiveness. Skin testing&#xD;
      specifically involves placing a drop of histamine solution on the skin surface. A needle is&#xD;
      then penetrated gently into the epidermis. The same procedure will be used for codeine and&#xD;
      saline. Tests will be spaced at least 2 cm apart to avoid false reactions. Testing will&#xD;
      include two standard sites for skin testing, i.e. arm and back, for all participants. An area&#xD;
      of skin with café-au-lait formation and its normal skin counterpart will be tested on the&#xD;
      patients with MAS. The normal controls will undergo skin testing at a matched area. Testing&#xD;
      will be performed in the Allergy Clinic by a trained allergy fellow or attending. Wheal and&#xD;
      flare responses will be documented 20 minutes after the skin tests are administered. The&#xD;
      wheal and flare response will be outlined in ink, and the image will be transferred to&#xD;
      hypoallergenic transparent tape and placed on a data collection sheet for measurement. The&#xD;
      longest and orthogonal erythema diameters are measured and summed. Sum of wheal diameters&#xD;
      will be determined in a similar manner. Previous studies have shown that a standard wheal and&#xD;
      flare response yields a sum of 7.0 cm ± 1.25 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After testing is complete, participants will then be given a dose of antihistamine (Zyrtec)&#xD;
      and topical calamine lotion to pin prick areas to decrease irritation. There will be careful&#xD;
      monitoring for extreme hypersensitivity or anaphylaxis as is the usual standard of care when&#xD;
      testing children for allergies. However, classic systemic allergic reactions are caused by&#xD;
      protein allergens. As histamine and codeine are not protein compounds, a systemic allergic&#xD;
      reaction would not be expected. An epinephrine pen will be on hand for use if such an unusual&#xD;
      reaction occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently there is no literature stating that children with McCune-Albright syndrome display&#xD;
      an increased responsiveness to histamine. If this study shows that MAS patients indeed do&#xD;
      have increased histamine responsiveness, risk for severe allergic reactions could be&#xD;
      anticipated. Life threatening events could be potentially averted by having MAS patients&#xD;
      carry epinephrine pens and/or by treating these patients with antihistamines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A published report of standard wheal and flare responses to histamine demonstrates that the&#xD;
      sum of the longest (A) and orthogonal (B) (determined by the midpoint of A, labeled X) [Σ&#xD;
      =A+B] diameter of the wheal and flare response to histamine was 7.0 cm ± 1.25 cm. (mean ±&#xD;
      S.D.) Assuming that McCune-Albright patients will display a mean wheal and flare response 50%&#xD;
      greater in diameter compared to controls, and using an alpha level of 0.05; testing of 10&#xD;
      patients will provide an 84% power to detect differences between patients and controls.&#xD;
