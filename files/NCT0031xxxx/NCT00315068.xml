  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation using radiofrequency is a new therapeutic tool to treat atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      with a higher success rate than medical therapy (80% versus less than 50% respectively).&#xD;
      Because of the length of the intervention and of the risk of complications of the procedure,&#xD;
      it would be important to determine success rate before the intervention. The information&#xD;
      gained from this study will in all probability improve our estimation of the chances of a&#xD;
      successful intervention and may enable us to take necessary therapeutic measures in case of&#xD;
      an elevated risk of recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple studies suggest that the 2 markers in this study could provide information of this&#xD;
      nature, however, their utility in the radiofrequency catheter ablation treatment of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation has never been demonstrated.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Catheter ablation of atrial fibrillation is a recent therapeutic tool to treat atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation. The success rate of eliminating atrial fibrillation by radiofrequency catheter&#xD;
      ablation is 80 %, after one or sometimes two procedures, against 20-50 % with drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This intervention may be complicated by : hematoma at the puncture site - 1 % incidence;&#xD;
      thromboembolic events &lt; 1 % incidence; cardiac perforation with tamponade &lt; 1 %, pulmonary&#xD;
      vein stenosis 2 % incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate blood tests of biological products (NT-proBNP and CRP)&#xD;
      as markers of prognosis and success after radiofrequency catheter ablation for atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies demonstrated the prognostic value of NT-proBNP and CRP in the recurrence of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation after electrical cardioversion. However the prognostic value of these&#xD;
      biomarkers was never demonstrated in the setting of radiofrequency catheter ablation of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observation study including 180 patients with the indication of catheter ablation&#xD;
      for atrial fibrillation. Confounding factors of increased NT-proBNP will be assessed with&#xD;
      echocardiographic imaging.&#xD;
