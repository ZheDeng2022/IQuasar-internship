  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the effectiveness of two different tuberculosis (TB) prevention&#xD;
      strategies, DOTS or DOTS-A. DOTS is the current prevention strategy for TB. DOTS-A is an&#xD;
      enhanced prevention strategy that will screen household members of individuals diagnosed with&#xD;
      active TB and will provide enhanced treatment as needed. The study will be conducted in 8&#xD;
      communities located in Rio de Janeiro. Study participants will include 6400 males and females&#xD;
      of all ages, including active TB patients and their household contacts. Patients with TB&#xD;
      identified for treatment at the Health Clinics of 8 urban communities will be eligible. The&#xD;
      communities will be assigned to 1 of the 2 prevention strategies, DOTS or DOTS-A. After 4&#xD;
      years, the information gathered during the study will be used to determine the incidence of&#xD;
      TB in these communities to see which prevention strategy was more effective in decreasing TB.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a single site, prospective, community-randomized trial to study the&#xD;
      effectiveness for two TB prevention strategies on the community incidence of TB: DOTS versus&#xD;
      Enhanced DOTS (DOTS-Ampliado, or DOTS-A). DOTS-A will add intensive screening of household&#xD;
      contacts of active TB cases and the provision of TB treatment or prophylaxis as needed to the&#xD;
      standard DOTS regimen. Adult contacts in the DOTS-A communities will be offered enrollment&#xD;
      into a randomized clinical trial comparing rifapentine/isoniazid preventive therapy to&#xD;
      rifampin/pyrazinamide. Subjects will be recruited from TB cases identified for treatment at&#xD;
      the Health Clinics of eight urban communities. These communities will be matched and randomly&#xD;
      assigned to receive either DOTS or DOTS-A strategy. The change in the incidence of TB in the&#xD;
      two groups of communities will be measured after a 4-year period to determine whether DOTS-A&#xD;
      strategy significantly reduces the incidence of TB compared to DOTS alone.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Cases will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any age male or female with new or recurrent diagnosis of TB&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Willingness and ability to adhere to study medications and protocol procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Willingness to provide signed informed consent or signed informed consent/assent&#xD;
             provided by parent or legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contacts will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Male or female living in household of a pulmonary TB case, at high risk for developing&#xD;
             TB (but without evidence for active TB).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. High-risk household contacts will be defined as those who are:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  HIV seropositive, regardless of the results of initial tuberculin skin test (TST)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  TST positive at the time of the first household evaluation. TST positivity will&#xD;
                  be defined as greater than or equal to 5 mm induration of 5 TU of PPD using the&#xD;
                  Mantoux method, read between 48 and 72 hours after application.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  TST negative at the time for the first household evaluation and TST positive at&#xD;
                  the time of the second household evaluation 3 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Willingness to provide signed informed consent or signed informed consent/assent&#xD;
                  provided by parent or legal guardian.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Contacts will be excluded from preventive therapy if:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Current active clinical tuberculosis-confirmed or suspected&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. History of sensitivity/intolerance to any of the study medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Evidence of acute hepatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. History or laboratory evidence of cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant females (treatment of latent infection will be deferred)&#xD;
