    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, open-label study in male patients with metastatic HRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each cycle will be 21 days (3 weeks). Patients will receive the following drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Docetaxel 75 mg/m2 IV given over 1 hour on Day 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prednisone 5 mg orally twice daily beginning on Day 1 and continuing until disease&#xD;
           progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sargramostim 250 mcg/m2 SC on Days 2-15 of each cycle. Patients will be evaluated every&#xD;
           4 cycles (12 weeks) for response using RECIST criteria. PSA response will be evaluated&#xD;
           according to the National Cancer Institute (NCI) PSA Working Group Criteria. To evaluate&#xD;
           the safety of this drug combination, patients will be evaluated at each clinic visit for&#xD;
           adverse events. Toxicities will be assessed per National Cancer Institute (NCI) CTCAE&#xD;
           Version 3.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Those patients achieving stable disease or better will continue therapy. Those patients&#xD;
      experiencing progressive disease will be taken off study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive a maximum of 10 cycles of treatment.&#xD;

             patient has recovered from the acute toxic effects of treatment prior to trial&#xD;
             enrollment. Irradiation of a symptomatic lesion, or one that may produce disability&#xD;
             (eg, unstable femur) prior to study initiation is permitted, provided other measurable&#xD;
             disease is present. Prior radiation treatment must have been completed at least 4&#xD;
             weeks prior to enrollment. Lesions that have been irradiated in the advanced disease&#xD;
