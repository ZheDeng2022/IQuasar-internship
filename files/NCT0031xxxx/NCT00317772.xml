      The purposes of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine the dose limiting toxicity (DLT) and the maximum tolerated dose (MTD)&#xD;
           weekly of topotecan in combination with standard dose gefitinib in patients with&#xD;
           relapsed, platinum-resistant, ovarian, peritoneal or fallopian tube cancers that are&#xD;
           epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF-R) positive (&gt;/= 1+).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the response rate and response duration in this patient population treated&#xD;
           with the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of topotecan administered on a weekly schedule in&#xD;
           combination with standard dose gefitinib, given by way of the mouth (PO) daily.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gefitinib inhibits the activity of a molecule present on the cancer cell that plays a role in&#xD;
      cancer cell growth. Topotecan is an FDA approved drug used to treat ovarian cancer that is&#xD;
      still present after treatment with chemotherapy. It is also used to treat recurrent ovarian&#xD;
      cancer (patients whose cancer returns after they have been cancer-free for a period of time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before treatment starts, you will have a complete physical exam, routine blood tests (about&#xD;
      2-3 teaspoons), a chest x-ray, and a CT scan or MRI. Women who are able to have children must&#xD;
      have a negative blood pregnancy test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 2 phases to this study. In the first phase, 3 different dose levels of topotecan&#xD;
      are being studied. The dose of topotecan that you receive will depend on when you are&#xD;
      enrolled. It will also depend on whether or not other participants had side effects from&#xD;
      their treatment. Although the dose of topotecan will vary, the dose of gefitinib is the same&#xD;
      for all participants. Up to 6 participants may be treated at each dose. The goal of this&#xD;
      portion of the study is to find the highest safe dose of this drug combination. Up to 18&#xD;
      patients will be treated on this part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the highest safe dose of topotecan has been found, the second phase of the study will&#xD;
      begin. In this phase, all participants will receive the same dose of topotecan and gefitinib.&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will be enrolled in this part of the study (but 6 will be from the 1st&#xD;
      portion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each treatment cycle is 28 days long. You will take one gefitinib tablet by mouth every day&#xD;
      beginning on Day 1. In addition, you will be given topotecan through a catheter (tube) placed&#xD;
      in a vein over 30 minutes on Days 1, 8, and 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests to check your kidney, liver, and bone marrow function and a complete checkup&#xD;
      (physical examination, including a pelvic and rectal exam) will be done before each course of&#xD;
      therapy and a month after treatment ends. About 2-3 teaspoons of blood will be collected for&#xD;
      routine blood tests each time blood is drawn during this study. Follow up CT scans or MRI&#xD;
      scans will be done after every 2 to 3 cycles to evaluate your response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be taken off study if your disease gets worse or intolerable side effects occur. If&#xD;
      you have a complete response to this therapy (no evidence of cancer) then treatment will&#xD;
      continue for an additional 6 months and then stop. All treatment is given on an outpatient&#xD;
      basis at UTMDACC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be monitored for at least 30 days after your last dose of therapy. If you have side&#xD;
      effects related to this treatment combination, you will be monitored longer (until the side&#xD;
      effects have gone away).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Both gefitinib and topotecan are FDA approved and&#xD;
      commercially available. However, their use together in this study is investigational. A total&#xD;
      of up to 52 patients will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at UTMDACC.&#xD;
