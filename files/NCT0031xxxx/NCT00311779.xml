    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to determine the safety and efficacy of different&#xD;
      strengths of Spinosad topical creme, as compared to a vehicle control, in subjects who have&#xD;
      been infested with at least a mild case of Pediculosis capitis (head lice).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There are millions of children and adults affected with head lice each year in the United&#xD;
      States. It has become a major nuisance in school children resulting in many lost school days&#xD;
      and frustrated parents. Lice and nit (ova) resistance to current OTC products has been&#xD;
      reported. Compliance with product instructions is thought to be low. Therefore a safe and&#xD;
      effective alternative to these products is desirable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinosad and its formulations have been approved by the Environmental Protection Agency as&#xD;
      crop protection products in the US, Canada and Australia, and has received provisional&#xD;
      approval in the UK, Spain and several other European Union countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spinosad is being formulated as a creme rinse using excipients that are widely used and are&#xD;
      &quot;generally regarded as safe&quot; (GRAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is intended to show the safety and efficacy of Spinosad 0.5% and 1.0%, as compared&#xD;
      to the vehicle control in subjects 2 years of age and older with at least a mild infestation&#xD;
      of pediculosis capitis.&#xD;
