      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy is the gold standard for diagnosis and endoscopic treatment of diseases in the&#xD;
      colon and rectum (1). However, many patients experience discomfort during the procedure.&#xD;
      Therefore, IV sedation and/or analgesia is routinely given during colonoscopy at the majority&#xD;
      of centers around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midazolam, the most frequent sedative, is a benzodiazepine with hypnotic and sedative effects&#xD;
      (2). The half-life of the substance is about 1-2.5 hours, and thus substantially longer than&#xD;
      the duration of a colonoscopy (approximately 30 minutes). Additionally, Midazolam gives&#xD;
      pronounced amnesia that lasts even longer than the hypnotic effect. Opioids are also&#xD;
      frequently used during colonoscopy, with Pethidine as the most common one (half-life: 3&#xD;
      hours).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use of the above mentioned drugs make it necessary to closely monitor the patients after&#xD;
      colonoscopy for several hours, often in specially designed resource-demanding recovery units.&#xD;
      Furthermore, due to the amnesia, it is often not possible to give information about findings&#xD;
      and further work-up or surveillance to patients after colonoscopy. Finally, patients are not&#xD;
      allowed to drive a car for the rest of the day after IV sedation during colonoscopy (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nitrous oxide (N2O) is used as an inhalative gas during anesthesia, labour and at some&#xD;
      dentist practices, most frequent in a fixed 50:50 combination with O2. N2O has a strong&#xD;
      analgetic effect, and none or only slight sedative effects in concentrations &lt; 80%. N2O has a&#xD;
      very rapid onset of effect (a few seconds), and its half-life in the human body after the&#xD;
      stop of inhalation is shorter than 1 minute (3). Patients receiving N2O in a 50:50&#xD;
      combination with O2 are awake, don't need post-procedure recovery and may drive their own car&#xD;
      home (4). However, as N2O diffuses quickly through biological membranes, caution is warranted&#xD;
      when used for patients with the following conditions: sinusitis, otitis, ileus, bowl&#xD;
      obstruction, and megacolon. Pregnant women should not be exposed to N2O.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are some small studies showing good analgetic effects of N2O during colonoscopy,&#xD;
      without significant side-effects (5,6,7). One additional study, however, reported on the poor&#xD;
      effects of N2O during colonoscopy (8). This study has, however, been subject for critique&#xD;
      because it lacks in methodology (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
      N2O is currently used only at some hospitals around the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of N2O in colonoscopy instead of IV drugs seems to be attractive for several reasons:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adequate analgesia without disturbing sedation during the procedure. The patient is&#xD;
           awake and co-operative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No amnesia. All information can be given to the patient immediately after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient can control inhalation of the analgetic N2O himself. This may enhance&#xD;
           patient satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Rapid stop of effect after stopped administration. No surveillance needed, patients can&#xD;
           leave the hospital immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  N2O does not impair psychomotoric abilities (4,10). Thus, patients may use their own car&#xD;
           to and from the appointment. This is resource-sparing for the patient and/or payer.&#xD;
           Moreover, it may increase compliance for colonoscopy in rural areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis/endpoint&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Does the use of N2O during colonoscopy result in adequate analgesia for the patient?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Are there any side-effects due to the use of N2O during colonoscopy?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there a reduction in the number of patients needing IV sedation?&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Is there any dose reduction of IV drugs?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a randomised, controlled, double-blinded, single-center trial. Participants,&#xD;
      after giving written informed consent, are randomised to one of two treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group 1: N2O inhalation (verum)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group 2: O2 inhalation (placebo)&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in both groups will start their examination without any use of&#xD;
      sedatives/analgetics. On demand, the patients will then be instructed to use the mask for&#xD;
      inhalation of gas (N2O in verum group, O2 in placebo group). In case of insufficient effect&#xD;
      of inhalation, patients in both groups will be given midazolam and/or pethidine until&#xD;
      satisfactorily relieved from pain or discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the patient and the endoscopist are blinded with regard to the type of gas used. The&#xD;
      endoscopy assistant handles the gas couplings on scene. Randomisation will be done 1:1 for&#xD;
      the groups, in blocks of 6 patients, using a computer program and sealed envelopes for&#xD;
      concealment on scene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study medication&#xD;
&#xD;
      N2O or O2 is to be administrated by inhalation via a mouth/nose mask. N2O and O2 is delivered&#xD;
      by the central hospital gas system. The mask contains a tight circle, where gas is only&#xD;
      released from the mask by negative pressure from inspiration of the patient. This is to&#xD;
      prevent leakage of gas to the environment. The mask is held by the patient and the patient&#xD;
      controls the use of the mask (patient-controlled analgesia). The gas system has been approved&#xD;
      by the local department of medical equipment. Measurements of N2O concentrations in the&#xD;
      endoscopy room are frequently performed by an independent body, in accordance with Norwegian&#xD;
      law.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Midazolam (standard dose 2.5 mg) and pethidin (standard dose 25 mg) are used as IV drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stopping rules&#xD;
&#xD;
      If any adverse effects are observed, blinding is to be broken. The endoscopist decides&#xD;
      changes in the sedation procedure, as appropriate in the individual situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of pain and discomfort&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the examination, study participants receive a questionnaire about pain and discomfort&#xD;
      during and after the examination. This questionnaire has been used in our department for&#xD;
      several years, and is validated for the use in colonoscopy (11, 12). The questionnaire&#xD;
      contains a 4-point scale (4-VRS) for the patient's characterisation of pain and discomfort.&#xD;
      Additionally, the questionnaire asks about any side-effects observed by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire is to be filled in by the patient at home the day after the procedure, and&#xD;
      to be mailed back to the center in a prepaid envelope.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients who don't understand information given&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Age under 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Otitis/sinusitis&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Ileus/bowel obstruction&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Megacolon&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Suspected pneumothorax&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power calculation&#xD;
&#xD;
      As there is only limited knowledge from the literature, we will perform a pilot study&#xD;
      including 10 patients in each group. The data of the pilot study will then serve for a power&#xD;
      calculation to find out the number of individuals needed in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethics&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Norwegian version of the protocol has been approved by the regional ethics committee of&#xD;
      Southern Norway (no. S-05225). The Norwegian Data Inspectorate has been informed about the&#xD;
      study (no. 25660). The study is registered in a clinical trials registry&#xD;
      (www.clinicaltrials.gov).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ownership and publication&#xD;
&#xD;
      All generated data are owned by Rikshospitalet University Hospital. A manuscript dealing with&#xD;
      the data will be submitted to a medical journal for publication, regardless of the nature of&#xD;
      the results. Authorship will be according to the Vancouver rules (13).&#xD;
