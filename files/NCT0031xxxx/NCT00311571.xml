  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Microgravity during space flight induces physiological changes that affect astronauts' health&#xD;
      and performance. Space flight simulations such as prolonged bed rest can mimic some of these&#xD;
      changes and provide study conditions that are more accessible than during space flight. The&#xD;
      European Space Agency, ESA together with the French national space agency, CNES and the&#xD;
      Japanese national space agency, NASDA are performing extensive studies using long duration&#xD;
      bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies including several long and short term bed rest campaigns have yielded&#xD;
      significant medical data on the physiological changes induced by space flight. These data can&#xD;
      be used to study the effect of countermeasures, methods helping to prevent these&#xD;
      physiological changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long duration bed rest, lasting 3 months undertakes a variety of investigations involving&#xD;
      28 subjects. This study focuses on countermeasures, studying the effect of a bone tissue&#xD;
      stabilisation medication and resistive exercises to determine their suitability for use&#xD;
      during long duration stays on ISS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological changes recorded during space flight and bed rest mimic those observed in&#xD;
      some diseases and in the aging process. Significant clinical applications are expected as a&#xD;
      direct result of this experiment and future equivalent studies.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The spaceflights undertaken to date demonstrated that Man can adapt to the conditions&#xD;
      existing in space, particularly to weightlessness. However, the space environment and the&#xD;
      prevailing micro-gravity induce modifications which may affect the performances of the&#xD;
      astronauts. These modifications concern in particular the cardiovascular and hormonal&#xD;
      systems, the muscles, the bones, the blood and the immune system. Other problems may occur&#xD;
      during long duration flights, such as the problems created by psychological stress due to the&#xD;
      confinement, or those resulting from the cosmic rays (radiation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In view of the fact that space flight opportunities are few, experiences simulating the&#xD;
      effects of weightlessness experiences are undertaken on the earth, in order to better&#xD;
      understand the adaptation mechanisms, prepare the spaceflights, perfect and evaluate&#xD;
      corrective methods (called counter-measures) such as physical exercise or medication, to&#xD;
      facilitate the astronauts' return to base. These experiments are also a necessity, in view of&#xD;
      the difficulties encountered when carrying out certain experiences during the flights, due to&#xD;
      the presence of too few astronauts on board, and to the lack of advanced biomedical devices&#xD;
      onboard (scanner, etc.). The most common simulation is that of the anti-orthostatic bed rest&#xD;
      (tilted position with the head slightly under the feet at a -6° angle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the current objective is to simulate flights in the International Space Station (3 to 6&#xD;
      months) or possible flights to Mars (500 to 1000 days), it is mandatory to extend the&#xD;
      duration of the simulation experiments. This is why three Space Agencies, CNES (France),&#xD;
      European Space Agency (ESA, European Union), National Space Development Agency of Japan&#xD;
      (NASDA, Japan) decided to join forces and undertake in common such simulation campaigns on&#xD;
      ground, to best apprehend the adaptation processes to the constraints of the space&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2 main objectives of this experiment are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study the physiological changes mechanisms during a ground-based experiment&#xD;
           simulating long duration spaceflights,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to develop and validate preventive methods (countermeasures) using standard tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is why we will test in the present study the effects of an orthostatic bed rest&#xD;
      (decubitus) of 90 days (3 months) on the following physiological systems :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the bones,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the muscles,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the cardiovascular system and its control mechanisms,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the sleep,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the spine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of gravity, the weight of the astronaut and that of the objects disappear&#xD;
      completely. This induces modifications of the bones and the muscles which can severely affect&#xD;
      the astronaut's life during the flight, and even more when returning to earth. This is a&#xD;
      fundamental point to study, since it may become a limiting factor and even an obstacle to&#xD;
      long duration flights. This experiment should also permit the test of physical exercise&#xD;
      program and of a drug, pamidronate (AREDIA®), as counter-measures against the effects of&#xD;
      weightlessness on the locomotion system (skeleton and muscles).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 28 volunteers will participate to this experiment, split into three groups. Said&#xD;
      experiment will spread on 2 years, 14 volunteers participating each time. The 3 groups are&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;physical exercise&quot; (9 volunteers),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;drug&quot; (pamidronate) (9 volunteers),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;control&quot; (10 volunteers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Members of the groups will be drawn by lot among the participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;Exercise&quot; : exposure of Man to microgravity results in a muscular atrophy which&#xD;
           affects the muscles of the lumbar region and those of the lower limbs which are&#xD;
           concerned by the standing position and the locomotion. During certain flights, physical&#xD;
           exercise programs have been implemented, in order to fight against this muscular&#xD;
           atrophy, maintain the physical condition required for the mission and prepare the&#xD;
           astronauts for their return on earth. In the course of the present experiment, a&#xD;
           physical exercise program will be tested on the 9 volunteers of this group (resistance&#xD;
           training using both calf and knee extensor muscles with a special devicecalled&#xD;
           Fly-Wheel).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;Drug&quot; : a Man in microgravity is the sole experimental model available to test&#xD;
           the rapid occurrence of osteoporosis on a healthy subject. Osteoporosis, or porous bone,&#xD;
           appears whenever the rate at which the bone material is replaced falls below that of&#xD;
           resorption, thus creating a bone fragility and an increased risk of fracture (hip, spine&#xD;
           and wrist essentially). It appears generally after menopause, when associated with aging&#xD;
           and a lack of physical activity. The pamidronate (Aredia®) is a drug present on the&#xD;
           market since many years, used for the treatment of several bone pathologies. This drug&#xD;
           will be tested on the 9 volunteers of this group, to demonstrate its efficiency in&#xD;
           treating of bone modifications. This drug (60mg) will be infused intravenously 14 days&#xD;
           before bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group &quot;control&quot; : this group will serve as reference for the experimentation. Volunteers&#xD;
           in this group will be without physical exercise and without drug. The existence of this&#xD;
           group is necessary to be able to compare the results of the 2 types of counter-measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experience will be carried out during a 120 days stay (a total of 4 months) at the Space&#xD;
      Clinic and will comprise:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 control ambulatory period of 15 days (subjects to report on day before) (-15 at -1),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 anti-orthostatic (-6°) bed rest period of 90 days (1 at 90),&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  1 recovery ambulatory period of 15 days (subjects to depart the following morning) (+1&#xD;
           at +15), representing a total of 122 nights spent at the clinic for all volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessments will be done by different European and Japanese scientific teams,each one&#xD;
      specialising in a specific domain. None of the 3 groups of volunteers will be submitted to&#xD;
      all experimentation programs.&#xD;
