  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is hypothesized that the intranasal administration of insulin will enhance&#xD;
      hippocampal-dependent neurocognitive performance in euthymic patients with bipolar I or II&#xD;
      disorder. This novel initiative represents a proof-of-concept study that insulin is salient&#xD;
      to neurocognitive functioning and deficits in bipolar disorder and represents a novel and&#xD;
      safe therapeutic avenue. The available literature suggests that the acute administration of&#xD;
      intranasal insulin enhances cognition in memory impaired older adults with either Alzheimer's&#xD;
      disease or minimal cognitive impairment. Prior research demonstrates a cognitive enhancing&#xD;
      effect of insulin within one hour of the first intranasal insulin dose. Other studies suggest&#xD;
      that the long-term administration of intranasal insulin (i.e. over eight weeks) in enhances&#xD;
      memory performance in human volunteers. We aim to evaluate the acute and long-term effects of&#xD;
      intranasal insulin administration in persons with bipolar disorder. As such we will be&#xD;
      conducting the neuropsychological testing at three time points, the week before receiving&#xD;
      insulin, within one hour of the first dose and after 8 weeks of insulin administration.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Sixty verified euthymic individuals (age 18-60) with DSM-IV-TR defined Bipolar Disorder&#xD;
      (diagnosis will be confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for the&#xD;
      DSM-IV) will be enrolled. Individuals below the age of 18 and over 60 are excluded as they&#xD;
      are not seen at the recruiting center. Enrollment into the study is voluntary. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will provide written informed consent. Subjects will be enrolled from the outpatient&#xD;
      Mood Disorders Psychopharmacology Unit (MDPU), University health Network, University of&#xD;
      Toronto. Study information and consent procedures will be provided by personnel other than&#xD;
      the primary treatment provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Euthymia (the absence of clinically meaningful symptoms) will be prospectively defined as a&#xD;
      score of 3 or less with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 7 item (HAMD-7) and a score&#xD;
      of 7 or less on the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) at initial assessment and at 1 month&#xD;
      (baseline). The HAMD-7 and YMRS will be repeated at every follow-up visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional pharmacological treatments for bipolar disorder will be permitted (e.g. Lithium,&#xD;
      anticonvulsant mood stabilizers, antipsychotics, antidepressants, anxiolytics/hypnotics,&#xD;
      etc.). Medication regimens will remain stable throughout the duration of the study.&#xD;
      Enrollment into the study is voluntary. Eligible subjects will provide written informed&#xD;
      consent. Study information and consent procedures will be provided by personnel other than&#xD;
      the primary treatment provider. Subjects will be enrolled from the outpatient Mood Disorders&#xD;
      Psychopharmacology Unit, University Health Network, University of Toronto. Illness&#xD;
      characteristics will be obtained from the patient interview and hospital medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be compensated for sundry expenses (i.e. parking, public transport). Subjects&#xD;
      will not receive financial compensation for being a participant in the study. The ongoing&#xD;
      provision of care is not contingent on enrollment and/or completion of the study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be excluded if they are receiving corticosteroids or antihypertensive&#xD;
      medications; another current Axis I psychiatric disorder; a neurological or medically&#xD;
      unstable condition; substance or alcohol misuse in the past 3 months; or electroconvulsive&#xD;
      therapy in the last year. Other exclusion criteria include the presence of diabetes mellitus&#xD;
      or hyperglycemia, BMI equal or greater than 40 kg/m^2 or inability to provide written&#xD;
      informed consent. Patients who are actively suicidal or evaluated as being a suicide risk&#xD;
      will be excluded. Other reasons for discontinuation are voluntary discontinuation, failure to&#xD;
      complete 1 month of euthymia, impaired fasting glucose (i.e. 6.1-6.9 mmol/L), non-compliance&#xD;
      (i.e. failure to administer &gt; 80% of the assigned treatment in any week). Insulin will be&#xD;
      measured quantitatively on a weekly basis; subjects will also complete a diary of when they&#xD;
      took intranasal insulin and their prescribed medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ongoing provision of care is not contingent on enrollment and/or completion of the study&#xD;
      protocol. Furthermore, there will be ongoing communication with the subject's primary care&#xD;
      provider in regards to their participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial visit entails the provision of detailed study information to a subject and&#xD;
      obtainment of written informed consent from the subject. The subject will then meet a&#xD;
      research team member at a later date for a screening visit. This study requires a total of 12&#xD;
      visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropsychological testing will be conducted at 3 time points:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Baseline (Visit 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Within 60 minutes of the first administration of randomized treatment (Visit 4)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Endpoint (Visit 12)&#xD;
