      Creatine as a new therapeutic strategy in depression:&#xD;

      Dr.Boris Nemetz and Prof.Joseph Levine M.D., Beer Sheva Mental Health Center,Israel.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatine plays a pivotal role in brain energy homeostasis, being a temporal and spatial&#xD;
      buffer for cytosolic and mitochondrial pools of the cellular energy currency adenosine&#xD;
      triphosphate (Wyss &amp; Kaddurah-Daouk, 2000). Recent studies have suggested increased brain&#xD;
      utilization of oxygen following oral creatine supplementation (Persky &amp; Brazeua, 2001).&#xD;
      Creatine supplementation is widely used in enhancing sports performance, and has been tried&#xD;
      in the treatment of neurological, neuromuscular and atherosclerotic disease with a paucity of&#xD;
      side effects (Persky &amp; Brazeua, 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatine enters the brain via a specialized sodium dependent transporter. Dechent et al&#xD;
      (1999) studied the effect of oral creatine supplementation of 20g/day for 4 wk demonstrating&#xD;
      a significant increase of mean concentration of total creatine across brain regions (8.7%&#xD;
      corresponding to 0.6mM, P &lt; 0.001). Lyoo et al (2003) studied magnetic resonance spectroscopy&#xD;
      of high-energy phosphate metabolites in human brain following oral supplementation of&#xD;
      creatine reporting that creatine (0.3 g/kg/day for the first 7 days and 0.03 g/kg/day for the&#xD;
      next 7 days) significantly increased brain creatine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Accumulated evidence suggests the possible involvement of altered cerebral energy metabolism&#xD;
      in the pathophysiology of depression (Mayberg, 1994). Functional brain imaging studies&#xD;
      (positron and single photon emission tomography) have shown decreased blood flow and&#xD;
      metabolism in the frontal lobes and basal ganglia in unipolar depression (Kennedy et al,&#xD;
      2001; Derevets et al, 2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy studies have studied brain levels of&#xD;
      creatine-containing compounds. Kato et al (1992) reported that phosphocreatine was&#xD;
      significantly decreased in severely (as opposed to mildly) depressed patients. Dager et al&#xD;
      (2004) studied depressed or mixed-state bipolar patients using two-dimensional proton&#xD;
      echo-planar spectroscopic imaging, reporting an inverse correlation between severity of&#xD;
      depression and white matter creatine levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, several studies suggest that agents with reported antidepressant activity may&#xD;
      increase brain levels of creatine containing compounds. Sartorius et al (2003) used MRS to&#xD;
      study metabolic changes in the hippocampus of rats and demonstrated a significant creatine&#xD;
      level rise induced by electroconvulsive shock treatment occurring specifically in the group&#xD;
      of animals which had exhibited depression-like [learned helplessness] behaviour before the&#xD;
      ECT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) and acetyl-L-carnitine - both reported to have antidepressant&#xD;
      effects - have increased brain phosphocreatine levels in healthy subjects (Silveri et al,&#xD;
      2003) and in geriatric depressed patients (Pettegrew et al, 2002) respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taken together, these findings suggest the possibility of using oral creatine supplementation&#xD;
      to increase brain levels of creatine containing compounds and therefore, most likely by&#xD;
      modifying high-energy phosphate metabolism in hypoactive brain areas, to treat subjects with&#xD;
      major depression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Open study of creatine in depression: A preliminary open study of creatine monohydrate&#xD;
      (Roitman S, Green T, Osher Y, Karni N and Joseph Levine, submitted), suggested a&#xD;
      statistically significant beneficial effect of creatine augmentation to antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment in resistant major depression, but possible precipitation of a manic switch in&#xD;
      resistant bipolar depression (see table 1 for results). Adverse reactions were mild and&#xD;
      transitory and included mild nausea and flatus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ww propose to perform a double-blind, parallel, randomized add-on clinical trial of creatine&#xD;
      versus placebo added to current antidepressant treatment in the treatment of major depressive&#xD;
      disorder in the early phase of treatment resistant major depressive episode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early phase of treatment resistant depressive episode is defined where the current treatment&#xD;
      resistant depressive episode lasts no more than 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the results of the open study presented in Tab.1, we hypothesize that such study&#xD;
      will show a statistically significant and clinically relevant difference between the active&#xD;
      treatment (creatine) and placebo in the double blind add-on trial design proposed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a parallel, randomized, double blind, placebo controlled, 4 weeks clinical&#xD;
      trial examining the effect of creatine versus placebo added to antidepressant treatment of&#xD;
      subjects with major depression demonstrating lack of adequate response to the current&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment, administered in adequate dose for at least 3 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Creatine will be purchased from Solgar LTD, Israel, where 1 tablet contains 1 gram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty consenting patients, women and men, 18 - 75 years old will be recruited. All subjects&#xD;
      will have a primary diagnosis of major depression, and at the time of recruitment will be&#xD;
      experiencing a major depressive episode with a duration ≥ 3 weeks and &lt; 6 months. Subjects&#xD;
      will be eligible to enter the study only if they will have a minimum score of 18 points on&#xD;
      the 24-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) and are receiving conventional&#xD;
      antidepressant treatment in adequate dose for at least 3 weeks with no more than mild&#xD;
      improvement Blood cell count, liver and kidney functions will be performed before entering&#xD;
      the study, only in patients who have not had them performed during the last 6 month prior to&#xD;
      entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant or lactating patients, those with clinically significant or unstable medical&#xD;
      conditions, epilepsy, or a history of alcohol or substance abuse will be excluded from this&#xD;
      study. All participants will be monitored weekly and will have a 24 hours telephone access to&#xD;
      the researcher, and those who will develop suicidal or aggressive behaviors that may endanger&#xD;
      themselves or others, will be immediately discontinued from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher evaluating the HAM-D as well as the other study scales will be blind to the&#xD;
      add-on treatment (creatine or placebo). Twenty patients will be treated with creatine add-on&#xD;
      for 4 weeks (up to 10 grams).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other 20 patients will be receiving placebo add-on for 4 weeks. Patient's antidepressant&#xD;
      treatment will not be changed during the study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Benzodiazepines are allowed, but the dose will not exceed Lorazepam equivalent dose of 4 mg&#xD;
      daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be recorded at the beginning of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data Psychosocial data History of hospitalizations Comorbid medical conditions&#xD;
      Family history of affective disorders Previous pharmacological treatments and treatment&#xD;
      response Seasonal pattern of depressive symptomatology&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following scales will be completed at the beginning of the study and weekly thereafter&#xD;
      (weeks 1 to 4):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (24 items) Clinical Global Impression Backwards digit span&#xD;
      test Scale for the assessment of side effects&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome measure will be the prediction of a sustained ≥ 50 % decrease of the&#xD;
      Hamilton Depression Scale (HAM-D) total score versus baseline ('sustained response') and the&#xD;
      presence of ≥20 % HAM-D total score improvement after 1 weeks of treatment('early&#xD;
      improvement')and the presence of ≥50 % HAM-D total score improvement after 1 weeks of&#xD;
      treatment ('very early improvement') .&#xD;
