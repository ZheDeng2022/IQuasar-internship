    <textblock>
      Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a worldwide disease, endemic in 88 countries, that has shown an&#xD;
      increasing incidence over the last two decades. So far, pentavalent antimony compounds have&#xD;
      been considered the treatment of choice, with a percentage of cure of about 85%. However, the&#xD;
      high efficacy of these drugs is counteracted by their many disadvantages and adverse events.&#xD;
      Previous studies have shown nitric oxide to be a potential alternative treatment when&#xD;
      administered topically with no serious adverse events. However, due to the unstable nitric&#xD;
      oxide release, the topical donors needed to be applied frequently, making the adherence to&#xD;
      the treatment difficult. The electrospinning technique has allowed the production of a&#xD;
      multilayer transdermal patch that produces a continuous and stable nitric oxide release. The&#xD;
      main objective of this study is to evaluate this novel nitric oxide topical donor for the&#xD;
      treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blind, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial, including 620&#xD;
      patients from endemic areas for leishmaniasis in Colombia was designed to investigate whether&#xD;
      this patch is as effective as meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of cutaneous&#xD;
      leishmaniasis but with less adverse events. Subjects with ulcers characteristic of cutaneous&#xD;
      leishmaniasis will be medically evaluated and laboratory tests and parasitological&#xD;
      confirmation performed. After checking the inclusion/exclusion criteria, the patients will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to one of two groups. During 20 days Group 1 will receive simultaneously&#xD;
      meglumine antimoniate and placebo of nitric oxide patches while Group 2 will receive placebo&#xD;
      of meglumine antimoniate and active nitric oxide patches. During the treatment visits, the&#xD;
      medications will be administered daily and the presence of adverse events assessed. During&#xD;
      the follow-up, the research group will visit the patients at days 21, 45, 90 and 180. The&#xD;
      healing process of the ulcer, the health of the participants, recidivisms and/or reinfection&#xD;
      will also be assessed. The evolution of the ulcers will be photographically registered. In&#xD;
      the case that the effectiveness of the patches is demonstrated, a novel and safe therapeutic&#xD;
      alternative for one of the most important public health problems in many countries will be&#xD;
      available to patients.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cutaneous Leishmaniasis (CL) is a worldwide disease that is endemic in 88 countries [1] . It&#xD;
      is estimated that 1.5 million people suffer from CL annually and that more than 350 million&#xD;
      are at risk of contracting the infection [2-4]. In America, 60,000 new cases of CL are&#xD;
      reported annually [5], being endemic in 20 of its 22 countries and in 2 islands of the&#xD;
      Caribbean [2]. Currently, CL has affected more than 500 U.S. Army soldiers serving in Iraq&#xD;
      [6]. In the Andean region, the incidence of Leishmaniasis has been increasing dramatically&#xD;
      over the last two decades; reaching more than 14,000 cases per year from 1996-98 [7]. In&#xD;
      Colombia 6,500 cases have been reported [8]. The increase in the reported cases of CL in&#xD;
      Colombia has been related to factors such as migration, deforestation, the multiplication of&#xD;
      illicit plantations, the armed political conflict and the behavioral changes of the vector.&#xD;
      The main strains of Leishmania in Colombia are L. panamensis, L. brazilensis, L. infantum and&#xD;
      L. guyanensis, which are distributed throughout the entire national territory, predominantly&#xD;
      in the rural areas [10]. CL is caused by intracellular protozoan parasites of the genus&#xD;
      Leishmania [1] and is transmitted to humans through the bite of a small percentage of the&#xD;
      species of phlebotomus and lutzomyia sandflies classified to date [10]. In the digestive&#xD;
      system of the sandflies, this dimorphic parasite presents an extracellular flagellated form&#xD;
      called a promastigote, which upon its release in the host blood, is phagocytized by the&#xD;
      macrophage, losing its flagella and turning into an amastigote [12]. Dogs, rodents and&#xD;
      didelphidae are the natural hosts of the parasite while man is an incidental host [11]. This&#xD;
      zoonosis has suffered an interesting urbanization phenomenon, changing from an eminent rural&#xD;
      entity affecting mainly men of an active age, to a disease that is affecting all people,&#xD;
      especially children [8,9]. The characteristic lesions of this disease are ulcers that heal&#xD;
      spontaneously over a period of three months to a year, depending on the isolate, and that&#xD;
      leave a flat, atrophic and depigmented scar [13-15]. The CL, especially the one produced by&#xD;
      L. brazilensis can evolve into mucocutaneous Leishmaniasis (MCL), which has a worse prognosis&#xD;
      owing to the deforming character of its lesions [16]. The spontaneous cure of these lesions&#xD;
      allows for the acquisition of partial resistance to reinfection, which could explain the&#xD;
      higher pathogenicity observed in the children and young adult population [9]. Previous&#xD;
      studies have shown a higher incidence of CL and a poor response to treatment in the children&#xD;
      population [17]. The program of epidemiological vigilance in Colombia requires that the&#xD;
      probable cases of CL (identified by ulcer features and by the patient's origin) be confirmed&#xD;
      by microscopic direct examination of a secession sample obtained from the ulcer, if these are&#xD;
      negative, by biopsy of the wound. Once confirmed, the cases must be notified to the Local&#xD;
      Health Secretary using clinical-epidemiological records. This institution, in charge of the&#xD;
      epidemiological vigilance, studies the sources of transmission and distributes the medication&#xD;
      to the people affected. Currently, various aspects are considered when treating CL, among&#xD;
      which, the risk of developing MCL, the grade, localization, number, size, evolution and&#xD;
      persistence of the lesions, are the most important [18]. For more than 60 years, the&#xD;
      pentavalent antimony compounds: sodium stibogluconate, (Pentostan®, produced by&#xD;
      Glaxo-Wellcome) and meglumine antimoniate, (Glucantime®, produced by Sanofi-Aventis) have&#xD;
      been considered the treatments of choice for this disease [19]. Studies made in Colombia&#xD;
      reported a percentage of cure of 85%, using meglumine antimoniate [20,21]. Despite the fact&#xD;
      that the efficacy of these drugs is high, they present many disadvantages such as parenteral&#xD;
      administration, and, reversible secondary effects such as nausea, vomiting, muscular and&#xD;
      abdominal pain, cardiac problems, a rise in the concentration of hepatic aminotransferases,&#xD;
      and chemical pancreatitis [21,22]. Additionally, the adherence to the treatment is affected&#xD;
      by its duration (several weeks) and its availability by the restriction in its distribution.&#xD;
      Therapeutic alternatives of second line have been proposed; amphotericin B and pentamidine&#xD;
      have been used with excellent results, nevertheless their high cost, little availability, the&#xD;
      necessity to hospitalize the patients for their administration and the severity of their&#xD;
      secondary effects have limited their use [23,24]. In the last decade new treatments for CL&#xD;
      have been developed, using oral agents such as mefloquine, itraconazole, miltefosine,&#xD;
      paromomycin, ketoconazole, allopurinol and dapsone, however, they have not shown enough&#xD;
      evidence of their effectiveness [19,21,25,26]. In an effort to develop a topical treatment&#xD;
      for CL, paromomycin has been used in different preparations. However, rates of curation&#xD;
      achieved with this medication have not been higher than conventional treatments, even when&#xD;
      compared with placebo [27,28]. In several studies, in vitro and in vivo, it has been&#xD;
      demonstrated that nitric oxide (NO) is effective to eliminate various strains of Leishmania&#xD;
      in its amastigote form [29-35]. The production of NO from the oxidation of L-arginine caused&#xD;
      by the inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) constitutes one of the most important defense&#xD;
      mechanisms of the macrophages [36], in which two oxidative forms of defense against&#xD;
      Leishmania have been identified. During the first phase of infection, in response to the&#xD;
      phagocytosis process, some promastigotes are eliminated due to the release of the superoxide&#xD;
      ion, a process which is catalyzed by the NADPH oxidase [29]. Those promastigotes that survive&#xD;
      this defense mechanism evolve into amastigotes, activating the production of IL-12 in the&#xD;
      macrophages and promoting the presentation of the antigens of Leishmania [29] to the T&#xD;
      helpers 1 lymphocytes that enhance the cytotoxic activities of the macrophages toward the&#xD;
      intracellular parasites via the interferon gamma (INFγ) and the tumor necrosis factor alpha&#xD;
      (TNFα) by promoting the production of NO catalyzed by iNOS [31-33]. A recent study shows a&#xD;
      higher activity of iNOS in the macrophages of subjects infected with CL, suggesting a vital&#xD;
      role of NO in the immunological activity against Leishmania [34]. In Studies with rodents&#xD;
      resistant to Leishmania infection (C57BL/6), where L. major, L. chagasi or L. donovani were&#xD;
      inoculated, the application of iNOS inhibitors like NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA) caused&#xD;
      a higher rate of survival and virulence of the parasites in macrophages [33,35,37,38]. After&#xD;
      inoculating L. major in mice with the genetic susceptibility to develop infections with&#xD;
      Leishmania (BALB/C), no activity of iNOS was observed. However, the application of IL-12, was&#xD;
      able to control the infection by activating iNOS [31]. In humans, several clinical trials&#xD;
      have been realized with topical treatments containing NO donors [39,40]. In Ecuador, our&#xD;
      group developed and tested a NO generating topical cream with S-nitroso-N-acetylpenicillamine&#xD;
      (SNAP), evidencing a beneficial effect in the management of this type of ulcers with no&#xD;
      reports of any serious adverse event. Nevertheless, due to the unstable nitric oxide release,&#xD;
      the cream had to be applied frequently (4 times a day) making the adherence to the treatment&#xD;
      difficult [39]. In Syria, another group used potassium nitrate acidified with salicylic acid&#xD;
      and ascorbic acid for the topical treatment of L. tropica [40]. In vitro, this NO generating&#xD;
      mixture destroyed the amastigotes and promastigotes of Leishmania; however, in vivo, the&#xD;
      study of 40 patients presented inconsistent results, reducing the size of the ulcer in 28% of&#xD;
      the subjects and healing only 12%. The discrepancy in these results is believed to be due to&#xD;
      the technique used to obtain the NO. The acidification of nitrite produces an instant blast&#xD;
      of NO, but its release is not maintained over a long period of time [40]. The difficulty of&#xD;
      controlling the liberation of NO has created the necessity of looking for new techniques to&#xD;
      regulate its release. The nanofiber polymers produced by the electrospinning technique have&#xD;
      been studied in order to guarantee the constant release of pharmaceuticals on the lesion. In&#xD;
      the electrospinning process, a high voltage is used to create an electrically charged jet of&#xD;
      polymer solution, which dries and solidifies to leave behind a dry polymer fiber [41]. As&#xD;
      this jet travels through the air, the solvent evaporates leaving behind a charged fiber that&#xD;
      can be electrically deflected and collected on a metal screen [42,43]. Fibers with a variety&#xD;
      of cross sectional shapes and sizes are produced from different polymers. With this&#xD;
      technique, the encapsulation or entrapment of several pharmaceuticals, enzymes and proteins&#xD;
      has been successful. In a previous study, nanofiber patches were successfully used as&#xD;
      releasing vehicles of tetracycline hydrochloride. The release of tetracycline was constant&#xD;
      for a period of 5 days [41;43]. Using the same model, a multilayer transdermal patch has been&#xD;
      produced, in which nitrite is bound to an ion exchange resin (DOWEX) and electrospun into a&#xD;
      polyurethane nanofibers layer. A solution containing Waterlock® superabsorbent and&#xD;
      polyurethane is electrospun on top of the nitrite-DOWEX layer. The ascorbic acid entrapped in&#xD;
      the polyurethane solution is electrospun onto a third layer, with another layer of Waterlock®&#xD;
      superabsorbent and polyurethane as the fourth and final one. Upon hydration, this Nitric&#xD;
      Oxide Releasing Patch (NOP) produces a stable release of 3.5 µmol of NO during 12 hrs&#xD;
      [41,44,45]. In a pilot study, developed in Landazuri, Santander, Colombia, a&#xD;
      placebo-controlled clinical trial was conducted with 35 patients who presented 68 ulcers&#xD;
      produced by L. panamensis. Using the NOP, a 65% improvement was observed in the treated&#xD;
      ulcers, with only a 25% improvement in the placebo group (p=0.001). In this pilot study the&#xD;
      unique adverse event described was pruritus in the area where the patch was applied&#xD;
      (unpublished data). Taking into account the wide distribution of CL, the changes in its form&#xD;
      of transmission and the difficulty related with the availability of medication, this study&#xD;
      proposes to investigate whether the NO donor transdermal patch, produced by electrospinning&#xD;
      is, at least, as effective as the meglumine antimoniate for the treatment of CL, with less&#xD;
      adverse events and a lower cost, constituting therefore an effective therapeutic alternative.&#xD;
      In case that the effectiveness of the NOP is demonstrated in this study, a novel and safe&#xD;
      therapeutic alternative of easy access and higher adherence for one of the most important&#xD;
      public health problems in our country will be made available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the effectiveness and safety of NOP in the treatment of CL compared with&#xD;
      meglumine antimoniate (Glucantime®).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the healing rate of CL ulcers using a NOP compared with the plan of&#xD;
           treatment with meglumine antimoniate recommended by the health ministry.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify adverse events associated with the application of NOP and compare them with&#xD;
           the ones produced by the treatment with meglumine antimoniate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To identify and compare the recidivisms that may occur with both NOP and meglumine&#xD;
           antimoniate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To advance in the search of a therapeutic alternative for CL in Colombia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      Double blind, randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled clinical trial, comparing nitric&#xD;
      oxide releasing patches with meglumine antimoniate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample was calculated according to the arccosine formula using a power of 80% and a type&#xD;
      1 error of 0.05%. Assigning a successful rate of 85% for meglumine antimoniate and 75% for&#xD;
      NOP, 558 patients will be needed. After adjustment for a loss rate of 5%, the total of&#xD;
      patients that must be recruited is 620 (310 patients per treatment group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The population will be composed from two regions of Colombia. The first one is an endemic&#xD;
      zone in Santander, Colombia, located between the Magdalena Valley and the East Mountain&#xD;
      Range, which includes the municipalities of Landazuri, El Carmen, San Vicente, El Playon and&#xD;
      Rionegro. The second region is an endemic zone in North Tolima, which includes the&#xD;
      municipalities of Chaparral, San Antonio, Libano, Falan, Palocabildo and Mariquita.&#xD;

&#xD;
      STUDY DEVELOPMENT&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will last 4 months and will include the following activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Training of the personnel that will participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acquisition of the materials required for the development of the project.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Elaboration of flyers, promotional and educative material, procedures manual and case&#xD;
           report forms (CRFs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment randomization. The treatment randomization will be realized by the&#xD;
           epidemiologist of the Cardiovascular Foundation of Colombia. This randomization will be&#xD;
           done in blocks in order to keep the size of the treatment groups similar, to avoid long&#xD;
           sequences of the same treatment and to balance when possible some of the bias inherent&#xD;
           to the simple randomization process. Additionally, this randomization in blocks will&#xD;
           facilitate the execution of interim analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment Phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will take 22 months. In the selected municipalities, the health personnel that&#xD;
      work in hospitals and health centers will receive training regarding the disease and the&#xD;
      study methodology. Simultaneously an epidemiological focus study will be done with the&#xD;
      leaders of the community and the health personnel to identify the geographic and demographic&#xD;
      conditions with the purpose of developing strategies for the recruitment of possible cases of&#xD;
      leishmaniasis. Subsequently, the subjects that present active ulcers with more than 2 weeks&#xD;
      of evolution, with or without parasitological confirmation of CL, will be invited by the&#xD;
      health promoters to attend the screening visit (Table 1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this visit a complete clinical history will be elaborated and data about antecedents&#xD;
      of leishmaniasis obtained (administered treatment, localization, number of lesions, etc). A&#xD;
      full medical evaluation will be realized based on universally accepted techniques. The&#xD;
      inclusion/exclusion criteria will be applied and the selected candidates informed about the&#xD;
      study after which they will sign an informed consent. For those subjects with ulcers of more&#xD;
      than two weeks of evolution without parasitological diagnosis a direct test will be performed&#xD;
      by the parasitologist. If the first direct test is negative, it will be repeated up to three&#xD;
      times; after which, in case of negative results, a biopsy will be performed. In case&#xD;
      leishmaniasis is not confirmed the patient will be remitted to the original health center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial Visit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included patients will be randomly assigned in one of two groups. A culture in&#xD;
      Novy-Nicole-McNeal (NNN) medium will be taken for strain identification and a blood sample&#xD;
      withdrawn from the antecubital vein for hepatic enzymes, creatinine, and pancreatic amylase&#xD;
      determination. During this visit, a complete medical evaluation will be performed, the ulcer&#xD;
      will be measured and a picture will be taken. Before taking the picture, a graduated rule&#xD;
      will be placed next to the ulcer along with a sticker marked with the identification code of&#xD;
      the participant, and the date of the visit. The first NOP (active or placebo) will be applied&#xD;
      covering the lesion and the first shot of meglumine antimoniate (active or placebo)&#xD;
      administered. The patients will receive information on how not to damage the patches and how&#xD;
      to identify and report adverse events. To help the patients to do so, they will receive a&#xD;
      diary to register them. The two groups randomly composed will be divided as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: During 20 days this group will receive simultaneously intramuscular (IM) meglumine&#xD;
      antimoniate (Glucantime® 20 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose of 3 ampules per day); and a NOP&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: During 20 days this group will receive simultaneously placebo of IM meglumine&#xD;
      antimoniate (5-15cc/day) and an active NOP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will visit the health center daily during 20 days to receive both the NOP&#xD;
      (placebo or active) and meglumine antimoniate (placebo or active). Daily, the subjects and&#xD;
      their adherence to the treatment will be assessed and the data collected. If any adverse&#xD;
      event is detected, the patient will be referred immediately to the medical staff who will&#xD;
      make an evaluation and report it to the adverse event committee that will take the final&#xD;
      decision in each case.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will last 10 months. During the follow-up, the patients will be seen by the&#xD;
      research group in 4 opportunities. The first visit will take place the day after the end of&#xD;
      the treatment (day 21) in which new blood samples will be taken for biochemical&#xD;
      determinations. The second, third and fourth visits will be realized on day 45, 90 and 180&#xD;
      respectively. During these visits the healing process of the ulcer, the presence of&#xD;
      recidivisms and/or reinfection and the health of the participants will be assessed. The&#xD;
      evolution of the ulcers will be photographically registered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The maximum and minimum diameters of the ulcer will be measured using a graduated ruler, and&#xD;
      the induration using the ballpoint pen technique. The ulcer and induration areas will be&#xD;
      calculated separately, and then registered in the CRF. The evaluation of the clinical&#xD;
      response will be based on the ulcer showing the least improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Complete clinical response: Complete reepithelization of the ulcer and disappearance of&#xD;
           the induration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical Improvement: Reduction of more than 50% of the ulcer and the induration areas&#xD;
           in relation to the last clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Absence of clinical response: Increase or reduction of less than 50% of the ulcer and&#xD;
           the induration areas in relation to the last clinical evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Therapeutic failure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Increase in the size of the ulcer by more than 50% in relation to the last clinical&#xD;
                evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Presence of the ulcer three months after the beginning of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Reactivation: Appearance of a lesion on the edge or in the center of the scar, with&#xD;
                positive parasitological diagnosis, after a period of complete reepithelization.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Affection of the mucous membranes: Presence of affections of the mucous membranes&#xD;
                during the treatment, at the end of it or in the follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Reinfection: Activation of an ulcer in an area different from the original lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects whose treatment will have been considered a failure the code will be broken and&#xD;
      they will be remitted to their original health center to look for another therapeutic&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      A complete physical examination will be realized and vital signs will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood Samples Withdrawn&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples will be withdrawn from the antecubital vein to perform the following&#xD;
      biochemical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Creatinine by spectrophotometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Alanine transaminase (ALT) by spectrophotometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Aspartate transaminase (AST) by spectrophotometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Pancreatic amylase by spectrophotometry&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Technique for the Direct Test of CL&#xD;
&#xD;
      A direct test is performed to confirm the presence of cells with amastigotes in a dermis&#xD;
      scrape[46,47]; the sample must be, in so far as it is possible, free of blood, cellular&#xD;
      detritus or pus. If the patients present several lesions, the sample must be taken from the&#xD;
      one with the shortest time of evolution, the biggest induration area and/or the least&#xD;
      purulent discharge. If the lesion has a scab it must be removed to improve the quality of the&#xD;
      sample. The sample can be taken from the active edge or from the bottom of the ulcer. When&#xD;
      the sample is taken from the active edge asepsis must be realized with alcohol at 70% and&#xD;
      hemostasis then performed using the first and second fingers to make sure that there is no&#xD;
      blood in the sample. A small incision of about 3mm in length and depth is made with a scalpel&#xD;
      in the active edge parallel to the edge of the ulcer. With the sharp side of the scalpel, a&#xD;
      scrape is done in the dermic wall of the incision to obtain tissue. The extracted material is&#xD;
      extended on two microscope slides. The sample is dried at room temperature, and then fixed&#xD;
      with methanol and stained with Giemsa, Wright or Field. Using immersion oil the sample is&#xD;
      observed under a microscope with a 100X lens, the presence of amastigotes of Leishmania&#xD;
      assessed and their structure verified (nucleus, kinetoplast and cell membrane). If the sample&#xD;
      is taken from the center of the lesion the same hemostatic technique must be used, the scab&#xD;
      removed, and the bottom of the ulcer well cleaned using the sharp side of the scalpel to&#xD;
      prevent the presence of cellular detritus and/or purulent material. This procedure must be&#xD;
      continued until the granulomas are seen at the bottom. With the same technique used to&#xD;
      process the samples from the active edge the presence of amastigotes of Leishmania is&#xD;
      verified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique for the sampling of cultures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample for the culture may be obtained by suctioning the ulcer active edge or by&#xD;
      extracting a fragment of tissue which is then macerated in a phosphate-buffered saline&#xD;
      solution (PBS) with antibiotics (1000 UI of crystalline penicillin per cc), before it is put&#xD;
      in the culture medium. A tuberculin syringe with a thin needle (26G), containing 0.3 cc of&#xD;
      PBS solution with antibiotics is used in the suction technique. Previous asepsis of the ulcer&#xD;
      with alcohol at 70%, a needle is introduced into the dermis and through rotating movements a&#xD;
      small amount of tissue is macerated by the needle bevel during about a minute, after which it&#xD;
      is suctioned into the syringe. The sample is deposited in aseptic conditions into a NNN&#xD;
      culture medium and incubated at 26ºC during 4 weeks [46,47]. Every week a drop is extracted&#xD;
      from the culture medium and placed between two slides to be observed under a microscope. In&#xD;
      case that promastigotes are not found, the cultures are rejected as negative [46]. The&#xD;
      strains are identified by species using the monoclonal antibodies developed by Dr. Diane Mc&#xD;
      Mahon Pratt [48,49].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation and management of adverse events&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the treatment and the follow-up visits, the patients will be asked about adverse&#xD;
      events. Each adverse event will be classified by the physician as serious or&#xD;
      non-serious(Table 2 and 3). A serious adverse event should meet one or more of the following&#xD;
      criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Death&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Life-threatening (i.e., immediate risk of death)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. In-patient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Persistent or significant disability/incapacity The presence of a serious adverse event&#xD;
           that puts the patient's life at risk and/or requires immediate medical or surgical&#xD;
           procedure will call for the discontinuation of the treatment and the initiation of the&#xD;
           pertinent medical management of the patients. The investigator will notify the Adverse&#xD;
           Event Committee (AEC) of the FCV of any serious adverse event within 24 hours of&#xD;
           learning about it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non serious adverse event will be classified as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mild: The patients are aware of their symptoms and/or signs, but those are tolerable.&#xD;
           They do not require medical intervention or specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Moderate: Patients present troubles that interfere with their daily activities. They&#xD;
           require medical intervention or specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Severe: The patients are unable to work or to attend their daily activities. They&#xD;
           require medical intervention or specific treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The possible relationship between the adverse events and the tested medication will be&#xD;
      classified by the investigator on the basis of his/her clinical judgment and the following&#xD;
      definitions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Definitely related: Event can be fully explained by the administration of the tested&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Probably related: Event is most likely to be explained by the administration of the&#xD;
           tested medication rather than other medications or by the patient's clinical state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Possibly related: Event may be explained by the administration of the tested medication&#xD;
           or other medications or by the patient's clinical state.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Not related: Event is most likely to be explained by the patient's clinical state or&#xD;
           other medications, rather than the tested one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the events will be reported to the AEC that, depending on their criteria, will decide for&#xD;
      the continuity or the withdrawal of the patient from the study and therefore the breaking of&#xD;
      the code.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the project has been designed to minimize the inherent risks, any adverse event&#xD;
      related to the study medications will be carefully evaluated by the AEC and the costs&#xD;
      generated by the required treatment will be covered by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis phase&#xD;
&#xD;
      This phase will last 6 months. After completing all the data entry to the CFR, the results&#xD;
      will be audited and the detected errors evaluated and corrected by the person in charge. The&#xD;
      information will be entered in two different databases by two different people and the&#xD;
      records will be compared to detect any discrepancy. The original CFR will be used to correct&#xD;
      any mistake in the database.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the statistical analysis, Stata 8.0 will be used. The descriptive analysis will be&#xD;
      composed of medians and proportions according to the nature of the variables, with its&#xD;
      respective 95% confidence intervals. As a dispersion measurement the standard deviation will&#xD;
      be calculated. The distribution of the variables will be studied using the Shapiro-Wilk test.&#xD;
      To detect any difference between the groups, a T-test or a Wilcoxon test will be performed&#xD;
      according to its distribution. The categorical variables will be compared using the Chi2 test&#xD;
      or the exact Fisher's test. If required, a model of multiple logistic regressions or a&#xD;
      covariance analysis will be done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two interim analyses will be performed when 35% and 70% of the calculated sample is&#xD;
      collected, with the objective of determining the differences in effectiveness and safety&#xD;
      between the treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoints&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study two endpoints will be evaluated:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Successful Treatment:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Complete reepithelization three months after the beginning of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Absence of reactivation and affections of the mucous membranes during the 6 months&#xD;
                of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Treatment Failure:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Incomplete reepithelization three months after the beginning of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Increase in the size of the ulcer by more than 50% in relation to the last clinical&#xD;
                evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Reactivation and/or affections of the mucous membranes during the 6 months of the&#xD;
                study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Final Report&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study the results will be evaluated and discussed and a final report&#xD;
      presented to COLCIENCIAS, entity that is sponsoring the project. The relevant results will be&#xD;
      published in both, national and international journals, and presented in congresses and&#xD;
      scientific meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ETHICAL ASPECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and with the&#xD;
      Colombian legislation as per the Resolution 8430/93 from the Ministry of Health. Prior to the&#xD;
      admission of the patients in the study, the objectives and the methodology will be explained&#xD;
      and the informed consent obtained. The study was approved by the Research Ethic Committee of&#xD;
      the Cardiovascular Foundation of Colombia (Act# 105/January 28/2005). The right to&#xD;
      confidentiality of the patients will be maintained in all the phases of the study.&#xD;
