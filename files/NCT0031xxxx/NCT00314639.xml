  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients suffering from schizophrenia and schizophrenia spectrum psychosis frequently&#xD;
      experience cognitive impairments. Such deficits may affect memory, attention and executive&#xD;
      function processes. Many studies have shown that cognitive impairments predict daily&#xD;
      functioning. Improvement of these difficulties represents a major component of recovery in&#xD;
      such population. Second generation antipsychotics, now first line intervention, have been&#xD;
      shown to improve cognitive processes compared to first generation agents. However, more&#xD;
      subtle cognitive impairments may still remain. In fact, cognitive impairments is one of the&#xD;
      most frequent subjective complaints from patients and their family, even though antipsychotic&#xD;
      treatment has been optimized. Very few options are available to clinicians to try to improve&#xD;
      such persistent cognitive difficulties. First, cognitive remediation techniques have shown&#xD;
      some effectiveness but results are sparse and come from a very small number of studies. It is&#xD;
      also not clear if cognitive improvement obtained from such techniques would apply to daily&#xD;
      functioning and can be generalized.A second possible intervention would be to add a&#xD;
      pharmacological agent able to improve cognition. Modafinil (Alertec) is officially indicated&#xD;
      for improving wakefulness in patients with excessive daytime sleepiness associated with&#xD;
      narcolepsy. Some empirical data and clinical observations suggest that modafinil could&#xD;
      improve alertness and/or cognitive functioning without exacerbating psychotic features in&#xD;
      persons with schizophrenia and psychotic disease in the spectrum of schizophrenia. This study&#xD;
      aims to (a) assess the effect on cognitive functioning of modafinil as an adjunctive to a&#xD;
      second generation antipsychotic in a prospective cohort of thirty patients suffering from&#xD;
      schizophrenia and psychosis in the spectrum of schizophrenia. This study will also (b)&#xD;
      evaluate the impacts of the addition of modafinil on side effects, psychopathology symptoms&#xD;
      and other health parameters (such as weight, metabolic profile, etc.). Our principal&#xD;
      hypothesis is that significant improvements will be observed on attention processes without&#xD;
      any exacerbation of psychotic symptoms or major emerging side effects. This cross-over&#xD;
      placebo-controlled prospective study will include patients with schizophrenia or psychosis in&#xD;
      the schizophrenia spectrum according to DSM IV definition, men or women aged over 18 years&#xD;
      old, with no item score equal or over 5 at PANSS positive symptoms subscale. At enrollment,&#xD;
      all patients will have to experience significant cognitive difficulties with scores equal or&#xD;
      lower than Z=-1.00 at Color trail test, Mesulam and Weintraub Cancellation Test, Stroop test&#xD;
      or Continuous Performance Test-II. Patients will be exposed to 100mg daily of Placebo or&#xD;
      Modafinil for 2 weeks than to 200mg daily for the two following weeks. A two weeks wash out&#xD;
      period will then take place before the same sequence will be start again. Patient will thus&#xD;
      be exposed one month to placebo and one month to modafinil or conversely, in a random&#xD;
      fashion.Assessments will include neurocognitive standardized battery, psychopathological&#xD;
      tools (PANSS, CGI, SOFAS, SDS), side effects (UKU, ESRS, DAI), vital signs, anthropometric&#xD;
      and metabolic profile.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. To have a diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizophrenia spectrum psychosis&#xD;
