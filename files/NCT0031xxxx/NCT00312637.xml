      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      of the axilla with spectroscopy can identify nodal features suggestive of metastatic&#xD;
      involvement in patients diagnosed with invasive breast cancer. This may enable us to define a&#xD;
      select group of patients for whom axillary lymph node dissection could be avoided.&#xD;

      Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death in women. The spread of cancer from the&#xD;
      breast to the lymph nodes is a significant factor in determining breast cancer survival.&#xD;
      Currently, surgical procedures are performed to determine lymph node involvement. Full&#xD;
      axillary lymph node dissection has a high morbidity associated with the procedure. While&#xD;
      sentinel lymphadenectomy avoids a full axillary dissection in clinically negative axilla in&#xD;
      untreated patients, it has been reported to have a false negative rate of less than 10%.&#xD;
      Others have reported higher false negative rates after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. For those&#xD;
      reasons, there is considerable interest in non-invasive methods that may allow staging of the&#xD;
      axilla.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the breast with contrast-enhancement is increasingly&#xD;
      being used in breast cancer patients to determine the size of the tumor and its extent. A few&#xD;
      reports from Europe have been published regarding its use in evaluating axillary lymph node&#xD;
      metastases preoperatively, and the results appear promising. Kvistad et al. demonstrated&#xD;
      lymph node metastases using dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI, in which the study had a&#xD;
      sensitivity of 83%, a specificity of 90%, and an accuracy of 88%. Luciani et al, suggest that&#xD;
      lymph nodes with a large size, irregular contours, round hila, high-signal intensity on T2&#xD;
      sequences, and those with marked enhancement are associated with malignancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic resonance imaging with spectroscopy (MRS) has been used in clinical practice for&#xD;
      evaluation of brain tumors as a method for noninvasive detection of tumor metabolism. More&#xD;
      recently, it has been used on other soft-tissue tumors, including breast. Like other&#xD;
      soft-tissue tumors, breast cancers have increased levels of the amino acid choline. In&#xD;
      several studies, the sensitivity and specificity of MRS for detecting breast cancer ranged&#xD;
      from 73%-92% and 71%-93%, respectively. No known MRS data has been published regarding&#xD;
      axillary lymph node involvement in patients with breast cancer. It is postulated that the&#xD;
      choline peak should be elevated in lymph nodes with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an observational study. All eligible patients who give informed consent will complete&#xD;
      a MRI/MRS screening questionnaire and if there are no contraindications will undergo MRI/MRS&#xD;
      imaging prior to their clinically indicated sentinel lymphadenectomy which may be followed by&#xD;
      axillary dissection to be determined by surgeon during the course of surgery.&#xD;
