      Chronic pancreatitis is a progressive inflammatory disease of the pancreas that presents with&#xD;
      abdominal pain and in late stages may cause diabetes and malnutrition. The pain may be&#xD;
      incapacitating and may affect patients physically, mentally and socially. Pain due to chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis is difficult to treat. Oxidative stress and free radical mediated injury has&#xD;
      been shown to cause pancreatic inflammation. It has been shown that patients with chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis are deficient in micronutrients and natural antioxidants such as b-carotene,&#xD;
      vitamin E and C etc. Studies have suggested that antioxidant supplementation may help to&#xD;
      combat pain in these patients. Antioxidant supplementation may decrease the oxidative stress&#xD;
      and boost the antioxidant status, thereby resulting in pain relief. The investigators have&#xD;
      planned to perform a trial to study the effect of antioxidant supplementation on pain relief&#xD;
      in patients with chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION Chronic pancreatitis (CP) is a progressive inflammatory disease of the pancreas&#xD;
      accompanied by abdominal pain and in late stages, by exocrine and endocrine insufficiency.&#xD;
      The etiology of CP include alcohol abuse, hereditary, ductal obstruction, tropical&#xD;
      pancreatitis, systemic diseases (systemic lupus erythematosus and cystic fibrosis etc.), and&#xD;
      idiopathic. Alcohol abuse accounts for 70-80% of cases of chronic pancreatitis in the West&#xD;
      and about 40% in India. The intensity of injury depends on the duration and amount of alcohol&#xD;
      consumed. Hereditary pancreatitis transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait accounts for a&#xD;
      small subset of all cases of CP, and occurs due to mutation in cationic trypsinogen gene.&#xD;
      Pancreatic duct obstruction may be secondary to trauma, pseudocysts, calcific stones or&#xD;
      tumors and leads to obstructive CP (1). Tropical pancreatitis is a condition of unknown&#xD;
      etiology that is seen predominantly in south India and other tropical areas of the World.&#xD;
      Young patients are commonly affected with this disease. Cassava consumption had been proposed&#xD;
      as an etiological factor due to its cyanogenic glycoside content however no epidemiological&#xD;
      study has proved this hypothesis (2). Malnutrition has been suggested as an etiological&#xD;
      factor in tropical pancreatitis. Idiopathic pancreatitis accounts for a substantial number of&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many recent studies have emphasized a role for Reactive Oxygen Radicals (ROR) in the&#xD;
      development of oxidative stress and hence inflammation in the pathogenesis of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis. Increased oxidative stress probably results from increased exposure to&#xD;
      xenobiotics. Xenobiotics are chemical substances present in the environment to which human&#xD;
      beings are constantly exposed. It is conceivable that many of these xenobiotics are&#xD;
      metabolized in pancreas that contains cytochrome P450 (CYP450) enzymatic system. The&#xD;
      metabolism of xenobiotics occurs through two phases, Phase I and Phase II. Phase I metabolism&#xD;
      may result in 'bioactivation' of the xenobiotics, in turn activating CYP system. Phase II&#xD;
      involves attachment of biotransformed compound to a biological molecule that makes it more&#xD;
      polar and thus easier to excrete. The metabolism of xenobiotics places an oxidative stress&#xD;
      and can overwhelm the natural antioxidant defense of the body. The resultant production of&#xD;
      the free radicals may play an important role in the pathogenesis of CP (2). Over induction of&#xD;
      this enzyme can cause increased utilization of glutathione (GSH), which causes irreversible&#xD;
      loss of glutathione. Moreover glutathione serves as a reservoir for cysteine/cystine required&#xD;
      for disulphide synthesis for pancreatic digestive proteins. This further aggravates the&#xD;
      situation. Three types of cytochrome enzymes are induced through xenobiotics. CYP2E1 has been&#xD;
      specifically examined in the context of liver injury. CYP1A metabolizes smoke constituents&#xD;
      and potent carcinogens such as benzo(a)pyrene. Cytochrome 3A is inducible by reactive oxygen&#xD;
      species generated from aflatoxin B1. Alcohol, nicotine from cigarette smoke and other forms&#xD;
      of tobacco consumption and industrial pollutants all are considered as xenobiotics and&#xD;
      overwhelm the detoxification capacity of cytochrome CYP450 system (3). The CYP induction&#xD;
      increases heme and heme-oxygenase thus buttressing the antioxidant defenses. The free radical&#xD;
      peroxidation products may act as second messengers and block exocytosis leading to increased&#xD;
      autophagy and crinophagy thus diverting the pancreatic enzymes into interstitium. This leads&#xD;
      to degranulation of mast cells inducing inflammation mediated by chemotaxis. The synthesis of&#xD;
      enzyme proteins in pancreas also produces H2O2, which also induces free radical production.&#xD;
      Furthermore the depressed methionine trans-sulphuration pathway induces CYP as well. The free&#xD;
      radicals generated from all these processes induce oxidative stress, which is implicated in&#xD;
      damage to cell membranes due to lipid peroxidation. Above all, if the antioxidant levels of&#xD;
      an individual are may be low due to either low intake or depletion during oxidative stress.&#xD;
      Some studies also indicate that free radicals cause disintegration of antioxidative enzymes&#xD;
      if over exposed to them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the role of oxidative stress still not fully explained in that whether the oxidative&#xD;
      stress is the cause of chronic pancreatitis or a consequence of it. This can be established&#xD;
      by two observations: 1) If the oxidative stress is noted before the onset of disease and 2)&#xD;
      If the disease symptoms are relieved by supplementation with antioxidants. Patients with&#xD;
      alcoholic pancreatitis have been shown to have an increased oxidative stress. Supplementation&#xD;
      with antioxidants hence decreases the production of such free radicals and may be beneficial&#xD;
      to patients with CP (4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study by Braganza et al has shown that CP involves oxidative stress in-patients with CP&#xD;
      (5). This was the first study to indicate the role of free radicals in the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      chronic pancreatitis. However, the mechanism by which it occurs is still unclear. The&#xD;
      preliminary studies show that malondialdehyde (MDA); a marker of peroxidation secondary to&#xD;
      oxidative stress increases during CP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the present proposed study, the aim is to find out if there is increased oxidative stress&#xD;
      in patients with CP and if supplementation with antioxidants relieves pain in them in order&#xD;
      to establish a relationship between oxidant stress and pathophysiology of chronic&#xD;
      pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effect of antioxidant supplementation given daily on pain relief in&#xD;
           chronic pancreatitis during the 6 months of therapy as compared to a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the improvement in oxidative stress and antioxidant profile in these patients&#xD;
           during 6 months of antioxidant supplementation by measuring markers of oxidative stress&#xD;
           and blood antioxidant levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Material and methods Study Design: Double blind randomized controlled trial Patients All&#xD;
      consecutive patients with chronic pancreatitis attending the pancreas clinic at AIIMS will be&#xD;
      included in the study as per the inclusion criteria. The diagnosis of CP will be made if&#xD;
      there is evidence of CP on imaging studies including plain film of the abdomen,&#xD;
      Ultrasonography, Computerized tomography (CT) scan, endoscopic retrograde&#xD;
      cholangiopancreatography (ERCP), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan. Also&#xD;
      hematological tests, biochemical investigations will be done as part of diagnostic work-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo detailed clinical evaluation including detailed family history of&#xD;
      pancreatic diseases and diabetes. The WHO criteria will be used to diagnose diabetes. The&#xD;
      patients will also be inquired about their dietary history and addiction to tobacco or&#xD;
      alcohol. Patients will be explained the purpose of study clearly and consent forms will be&#xD;
      duly signed by them. The patients will be regularly followed up in pancreas clinic at All&#xD;
      India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi. All the patients will be treated in the&#xD;
      standard manner including medical, endoscopic and surgical treatment as and when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CP with significant pain i.e. at least one episode of pain in a month requiring oral&#xD;
      analgesic or one episode of severe pain in last three months requiring hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation Sample size is calculated on the basis of probability sampling&#xD;
      methods. For 80% power at a significance level of 5% (a = 0.05), a sample size of 100 in each&#xD;
      arm would be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and blinding Randomization of treatment allocation largely ensures unbiased&#xD;
      treatment comparison. A simple randomization scheme for treatment allocation will be done&#xD;
      using a table of random numbers by a Statistician/ Epidemiologist not associated with conduct&#xD;
      of the study. He/she will label the boxes of treatment with individual patient numbers from&#xD;
      1-200 according to the randomization scheme. This person will keep the assignment code at a&#xD;
      safe place; the code will be available to the investigator only at the end of the trial.&#xD;
      These will be serially opened as new patients are recruited into the study. Double blinding&#xD;
      will be done to ensure minimum bias i.e. blinding of researcher and clinician attending&#xD;
      patients to the randomization process so that allocation and outcome evaluation are not&#xD;
      affected and blinding of patients to the identity of the drug or intervention they are&#xD;
      receiving. The inert placebo, which will be identical to the active drug in packaging,&#xD;
      appearance and schedule of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention One group will be given antioxidant supplementation and the other group will be&#xD;
      placebo. The antioxidant intervention will be daily doses of 600 mg organic selenium, 0.54 g&#xD;
      vitamin C, 9000 IU B-carotene, 270 IU vitamin E and 2 g methionine. Both the groups will be&#xD;
      supplemented with the pancreatic enzymes. The enzyme will be administered as capsules, each&#xD;
      containing 10,000 units. Three capsules (30,000) units will be required per meal thereby&#xD;
      making it to 90,000 units per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up assessment during study period:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of painful days and requirement of oral/ IV analgesic or hospitalization in a&#xD;
           month will be done. The patients will be provided with a pain diary so as to get the&#xD;
           correct data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any other symptoms either due to primary disease i.e. CP or considered due to the&#xD;
           intervention will be duly recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Pain assessment and clinical examination will be done at each visit of patient to&#xD;
                the clinic while USG, ERCP, CT or X-ray will be done as and when required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Markers of oxidative stress&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MDA Marker of antioxidant capacity or defense&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Superoxide dismutase (SOD), Total glutathione, Ferric Reducing Assay of Plasma (FRAP)&#xD;
           Markers of intervention compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vitamins A, E, C *All the biochemical investigations will be done at baseline, 1 and 6&#xD;
           months of intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the samples will be light protected and purged with nitrogen to retard deterioration from&#xD;
      oxidation of substrates during storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Descriptive statistics i.e. mean, standard deviation and frequency distribution&#xD;
      will be calculated for each variable in the study. To compare the two groups, Student 't'&#xD;
      test (quantitative) and chi square test (qualitative) wherever applicable will be applied. To&#xD;
      see trend within the variable 2-way analysis of variance (parametric as well as&#xD;
      non-parametric, whichever is applicable) will be done post-hoc analysis. P value &lt; 0.05 will&#xD;
      be considered as statistical significant. Statistic software SPSS 7.5 for Windows will be&#xD;
      used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Outcome Primary Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Reduction in the number of painful days per month due to chronic pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome&#xD;
