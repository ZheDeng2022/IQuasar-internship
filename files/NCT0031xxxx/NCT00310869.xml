    <textblock>
      This research study is a long-term follow-up to an earlier study of developmental care. For&#xD;
      that study, high risk preterm newborns were randomly assigned to a standard care group, which&#xD;
      received the standard care offered in the Newborn Intensive Care Unit (NICU) at the time, or&#xD;
      to an experimental group, which received regular behavioral observations to determine if&#xD;
      changes in their environment or care were needed. The purpose of the current study is to&#xD;
      assess the functioning of these infants again, now that they are adolescents and to compare&#xD;
      the groups to determine if the developmental care used in the original study is effective&#xD;
      long-term.&#xD;

      The study will test continued long-term intervention effectiveness into adolescence of very&#xD;
      early born US preterm infants, who participated in a randomized Newborn Individualized&#xD;
      Developmental Care and Assessment Program (NIDCAP) trial, conducted by the principal&#xD;
      investigator, while the infants were cared for in the NICU for the first three months after&#xD;
      their very premature births. All adolescents to be studied participated as newborns and were&#xD;
      assigned either to control care (standard NICU care available at the time), or to&#xD;
      experimental care (NIDCAP developmental care, with weekly bedside observations and with daily&#xD;
      NIDCAP developmental specialist support to parents and staff), from NICU admission until 2&#xD;
      weeks (w) after expected full-term due date ('corrected' age [CA]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The strongly brain-based theory underlying the approach to earliest intervention described&#xD;
      here has been tested in several experimental studies, which are designed to investigate the&#xD;
      effects of planned purposeful modification of experience for very early born infants, who&#xD;
      spend the third trimester of gestation in the NICU. NIDCAP is based on an approach which&#xD;
      utilizes close observation of each infant's thresholds of moving from organization to&#xD;
      disorganization and stress, as exhibited by the infant's behavior. Care and environment are&#xD;
      then continuously dynamically adjusted, with the goal to increase the infant's&#xD;
      self-regulation and organization and decrease the infant's stress. This individualized model&#xD;
      of NICU care provides an opportunity to investigate the modifiability of very early born&#xD;
      infants' brain function and structure and the possibility of reducing or altogether&#xD;
      eliminating the disruption and disturbance of fetal brain development in the NICU. The&#xD;
      randomized scientific trials to date, conducted by the PI and by independent investigators at&#xD;
      other settings after formal training show consistent significant neurobehavioral and&#xD;
      neurophysiological improvements for the experimental groups across sites and studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the adolescents to be studied were evaluated comprehensively at 2wCA and 9 months (m) CA&#xD;
      in terms of not only the commonly measured demographic, medical background and severity of&#xD;
      illness variables, but more importantly in terms of comprehensive neurobehavioral and EEG&#xD;
      outcome measures, analogues of later developmental competence and disability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design of the current study of adolescents is that of a randomized controlled trial (RCT)&#xD;
      with two parallel groups (control and experimental), with the question of the independent&#xD;
      variable 'group effect' on two dependent measures (adolescent physical growth and cognitive&#xD;
      development). In addition to group status, the contribution of four additional independent&#xD;
      measures on outcome will also be evaluated: Parent socioeconomic status, parent cognitive&#xD;
      function, adolescent physical function and adolescent psychosocial function. The outcome&#xD;
      examiners will be blind to subject group status throughout. The design assures a true&#xD;
      experimental test of the NICU intervention effects in adolescence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The significance and importance of the study lays in the unique opportunity to evaluate&#xD;
      comprehensively in adolescents the long-term neurodevelopment, learning and adaptive outcomes&#xD;
      due to developmental care intervention received in the earliest stage of development. This&#xD;
      will be the first study to test the long-term effectiveness of modification of experience in&#xD;
      the NICU in a brain-protective, learning-enhancing model for very high-risk, very early-born&#xD;
      preterm infants. The importance of the study lies in its potential to contribute&#xD;
      significantly to the understanding of preterm brain development in relationship to long-term&#xD;
      mental and adaptive functional outcomes in adolescence for the highly jeopardized and growing&#xD;
      group of very preterm children. The results are expected to be of key importance in decision&#xD;
      and policy development for the evidence-based targeting of sparse special education&#xD;
      resources.&#xD;
