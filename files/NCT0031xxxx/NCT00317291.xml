    <textblock>
      This is a sample-size-limited, randomized, blinded (subject and evaluator), sham&#xD;
      acupuncture/placebo moxibustion (sham acu/placebo moxa) controlled clinical trial. The&#xD;
      subjects in this study will be 50 men and women with HIV infection who have a diagnosis of&#xD;
      distal symmetric peripheral neuropathy (DSP). Subjects will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      experimental intervention conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 1: subjects receive acu/moxa treatment; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 2 (Control Group): subjects receive sham acu/placebo moxa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects in Conditions 1 and 2 will attend 16 scheduled sessions over 15 weeks, be&#xD;
      administered the same instruments, and submit their daily symptom diaries for analysis. There&#xD;
      will be six weeks of twice weekly treatment sessions, and three follow-up sessions at weeks&#xD;
      9, 11, and 15. All conditions will be identical in duration and be administered by licensed&#xD;
      acupuncturists trained in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM).&#xD;

      Subjects in this early-phase clinical trial will be 50 men and women with HIV infection who&#xD;
      have a diagnosis of Distal Symmetric Peripheral neuropathy (DSP). This study is a&#xD;
      prospective, randomized, sham/placebo controlled, blinded (subject and evaluator), parallel&#xD;
      groups clinical trial. Subjects will be randomized to one of two experimental intervention&#xD;
      conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 1: subjects receive Acu/Moxa Treatment; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Condition 2 (Control Group): subjects receive Sham acupuncture/Placebo moxibustion (Sham&#xD;
           Acu/Placebo Moxa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in Conditions 1 and 2 will attend 16 scheduled sessions over 15 weeks. All subjects&#xD;
      will: be blinded/masked to treatment assignments, attend the same number of protocol&#xD;
      sessions, be administered the same instruments, and submit their symptom diaries for data&#xD;
      entry and analysis. After a screening/intake session, randomization and treatment sessions&#xD;
      will follow. There will be six weeks of twice weekly treatment sessions, and three follow-up&#xD;
      sessions at weeks 9, 11 and 15. All conditions will be identical in duration and be&#xD;
      administered by licensed acupuncturists trained in Traditional Chinese Medicine. The aims of&#xD;
      this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To establish the feasibility of the combined Acupuncture/Moxibustion treatment for 6&#xD;
           weeks of twice weekly sessions, in order to reduce the pain related to DSP among persons&#xD;
           with HIV/AIDS, and to estimate the effect size of the Acu/Moxa treatment for a future&#xD;
           clinical study. Inclusion of 2-, 4-, and 8-week no-treatment follow-up sessions will&#xD;
           establish the maintainability of benefit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the effect of combined Acupuncture/Moxibustion treatment for 6 weeks of&#xD;
           twice weekly sessions on reducing symptoms of DSP (aching or burning pain, &quot;pins and&#xD;
           needles&quot; sensation, and numbness) among persons with HIV/AIDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To determine the effect of the combined Acupuncture/Moxibustion treatment for 6 weeks of&#xD;
           twice weekly sessions on patient-perceived DSP symptom improvement and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the logistics of a CAM clinical trial on persons with HIV/AIDS experiencing&#xD;
           DSP.&#xD;
