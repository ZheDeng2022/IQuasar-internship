  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a common and difficult problem for patients with cancer. It has been reported that&#xD;
      over 80% of cancer patients suffer from pain. Much of this pain is iatrogenic and related to&#xD;
      procedures. Dr. Grossman recently demonstrated that most patients undergoing bone marrow&#xD;
      biopsy have poor pain control during the procedure. Treatment of pain is almost entirely with&#xD;
      analgesic medications, principally opioids. These medications have numerous undesirable&#xD;
      effects such as sedation, confusion, hypotension and constipation that limit their efficacy&#xD;
      and utility. Drs. Diette, Lechtzin, Rubin and colleagues recently demonstrated that use of&#xD;
      nature sights and sounds (NSS), a simple, safe, and inexpensive intervention, decreases pain&#xD;
      during fiberoptic bronchoscopy, a procedure commonly performed to diagnose cancer and to&#xD;
      detect pulmonary complications of cancer therapy. Patients were randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      standard care with intravenous narcotics and benzodiazepines or standard care coupled with&#xD;
      view of a nature scene and use of nature sounds before, during, and after bronchoscopy. The&#xD;
      group assigned to the NSS reported significantly better pain control than the control group.&#xD;
      While these findings are novel and exciting, they raised several new questions that suggest&#xD;
      logical extensions of this work. It is not known whether this intervention can be applied to&#xD;
      patients in other settings, nor is it known whether comparison to standard care is an&#xD;
      appropriate control group. Further, the mechanism of action of NSS needs to be determined.&#xD;
      NSS may simply be a form of distraction therapy but it may have other properties. The theory&#xD;
      of biophilia proposes there are specific elements in nature imagery that exert beneficial&#xD;
      health effects. Because NSS appears to be a promising and safe intervention for the treatment&#xD;
      of pain, these investigators plan to perform a controlled clinical trial in cancer patients&#xD;
      undergoing invasive procedures. Patients will be randomly assigned to one of three arms,&#xD;
      standard care, NSS, and a non-nature based distraction technique. We will study the efficacy&#xD;
      of NSS for the management of procedure-related pain in oncology patients. The findings will&#xD;
      provide necessary background information to develop more definitive studies of NSS that&#xD;
      should be competitive for external funding. This exciting study will help develop a harmless,&#xD;
      inexpensive method to treat pain in cancer patients, that may complement or replace analgesic&#xD;
      medications.&#xD;

      Study Design: This is a randomized, controlled trial assessing the impact of nature sights&#xD;
      and sounds (NSS) on pain control in oncology outpatients undergoing bone marrow aspirate and&#xD;
      biopsy (BMBx) in the Weinberg Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins. One hundred twenty patients&#xD;
      will be assigned to one of three groups: 1) standard care, 2) NSS, 3) Music/Photo. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be pain scores during the procedures as measured by the Hopkins Pain&#xD;
      Rating Instrument (HPRI). Patients in all groups will receive analgesic medications as&#xD;
      dictated by the personnel performing the procedure and the physicians responsible for their&#xD;
      clinical care. Patients in the NSS group will have Bedscapes nature scene murals placed at&#xD;
      the bedside in a location that is visible throughout the procedure. They will also listen to&#xD;
      a complementary audiotape during the procedure. The music/photo group will listen to city&#xD;
      sounds during the procedure and view a poster of a city skyline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: The study will be conducted in the Weinberg Cancer Pavilion of the Kimmel Cancer&#xD;
      Center at the Johns Hopkins Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Selection: All patients 18 years and older with a diagnosis of cancer undergoing a&#xD;
      BMBx in the Johns Hopkins Oncology Center will be screened for enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informed Consent: The study design and consent procedure will be explained to all prospective&#xD;
      patients. If patients are interested in taking part in the study, written informed consent&#xD;
      will be obtained. The study nurse will administer a mental status exam and assess&#xD;
      eligibility. Consent and screening must occur within 5 days of the patient's procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: Blocked randomization will be used with variable block sizes to ensure roughly&#xD;
      equal numbers of patients in each study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions: All subjects will have pain managed by the physicians responsible for&#xD;
      their clinical care as dictated by those physicians. Subjects assigned to NSS will have&#xD;
      Bedscapes fabric panels depicting a scene of a mountain stream placed by the procedure table&#xD;
      at a location where it will be visible throughout the procedure. An accompanying audiotape of&#xD;
      complementary nature sounds will be played on portable tape players through headphones or&#xD;
      speakers. They will be instructed to listen to the tape and look at the nature scene as&#xD;
      frequently and for as long as they desire. The standard care group will have pain managed&#xD;
      according to current oncology center protocols but will not be allowed to use the distraction&#xD;
      interventions. The Music/Photo group will be played a tape of typical city sounds and will&#xD;
      have a poster of a city skyline placed by the procedure table. The city skyline poster will&#xD;
      be similar in size to the Bedscapes mural. The skyline image is a daytime photograph without&#xD;
      water, trees or other nature elements. The subjects will be asked to listen to the music and&#xD;
      view the picture during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HPRI will be used to measure pain. This is a plastic VAS with a sliding marker that moves&#xD;
      within a grove. The side facing the patient appears like a traditional VAS. It has a 10cm&#xD;
      line with the anchors &quot;No Pain&quot; and &quot;Worst Pain Imaginable&quot;. The opposite side of the&#xD;
      instrument is a 10 cm scale with markings every 0.5cm that enables the clinician to read and&#xD;
      record numerical values (see figure in appendix). Scores will be recorded to the nearest&#xD;
      0.5cm. All patients will have a baseline assessment of pain immediately prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. Subjects will be interviewed within one hour following the procedure and will be&#xD;
      asked to quantify their pain during the procedure.Patients will also complete a questionnaire&#xD;
      following the procedure in which they will score their level of pain control during the&#xD;
      procedure on a 5-point Likert scale, which was used in the bronchoscopy study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection: Following the procedure patients will complete a set of questionnaires.&#xD;
      Questions will inquire about attitudes, beliefs and prior use of CAM. Patients in the NSS,&#xD;
      and Music/Photo groups will be asked whether they found the study intervention to be helpful&#xD;
      and if so what aspects of the intervention were beneficial. They will be asked to rate their&#xD;
      satisfaction with several aspects of the procedure including comfort, the nursing care, the&#xD;
      physician care, and the facility. Psychological distress will be measured with the Brief&#xD;
      Symptom Index 18 , negative mood states and anxiety will be measured with the Profile of Mood&#xD;
      States (POMS) . The BSI provides a global symptom severity score that will be used to control&#xD;
      for subjects' underlying psychological distress, while POMS is well suited to measuring&#xD;
      changes in mood related to the procedure. We will specifically focus on the Tension-Anxiety,&#xD;
      Depression-Dejection, Anger-Hostility, and Confusion-Bewilderment subscales. Differences in&#xD;
      response to pain will be measured with the Pain Catastrophizing Scale . Salivary cortisol&#xD;
      will be measured before and after the procedure as a neuroendocrine marker of stress. Two&#xD;
      baseline measurements of cortisol will be taken at least 15 minutes apart prior to the&#xD;
      procedure. Immediately following the procedure three additional salivary cortisol samples&#xD;
      will be collected approximately 15 minutes apart. The study nurse will record heart rate,&#xD;
      blood pressure and respiratory rate before and every 15 minutes during the procedures. The&#xD;
      high and low systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be extracted. The&#xD;
      study nurse will record the percentage of time the patient used the study intervention during&#xD;
      the procedure. Patients will also be asked what percentage of the time they used the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: The primary outcomes is to determine if NSS is effective at reducing pain in cancer&#xD;
      patients undergoing invasive procedures, we will compare mean pain scores during the&#xD;
      procedure from the HPRI between the NSS group and the standard care group. We will also&#xD;
      compare the difference between ratings of baseline pain and pain during the procedure in the&#xD;
      two groups and the rating of pain control during the procedure between the groups. We will&#xD;
      also determine if NSS reduces pain more than non-nature based distraction therapy we will&#xD;
      compare pain ratings, and the difference in pain ratings from baseline to that during the&#xD;
      procedure between the NSS and the music/photo group. Lastly we will determine if NSS reduces&#xD;
      affective distress in cancer patients undergoing painful procedures we will compare mean&#xD;
      scores from the POMS between the three groups. Secondary outcomes that pertain to all&#xD;
      specific aims include vital signs during procedures and salivary cortisol levels. We will&#xD;
      also assess overall satisfaction with care, ratings of physicians, ratings of nurses, and&#xD;
      attitudes towards CAM interventions using Likert-type scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size: The primary outcome is difference in maximal pain level during procedures&#xD;
      between the NSS group and the Music/Photo group. Power estimates are based on the magnitude&#xD;
      of effect from the bronchoscopy study and the standard deviation of pain ratings in bone&#xD;
      marrow biopsies studied by Dr. Grossman. In order to have 80% power to detect a 2-point&#xD;
      difference in pain rating using the HPRI with an alpha error level of 0.05 we will need 29&#xD;
      patients in each group (total n=87). We plan to enroll 40 patients in each group (total&#xD;
      n=120) to compensate for study withdrawal and missing data. We will continue to enroll&#xD;
      patients until we have met these goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Entry and Management: The Biostatistics Core of the CAM center will provide&#xD;
      recommendations on data entry and analysis. Because this is a small, single center trial of a&#xD;
      relatively safe intervention there will not be a formal data safety monitoring committee.&#xD;
      However, Dr. Lechtzin will oversee data integrity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Events Monitoring: This is a minimal risk intervention and we expect very few adverse&#xD;
      events. During our bronchoscopy study there was only one adverse event; a patient became&#xD;
      incontinent on the procedure table due to the sound of running water. Adverse events to the&#xD;
      experimental intervention will be assessed at the interview following the procedure by&#xD;
      recording all voluntary complaints of subjects and through structured interviews. Attention&#xD;
      will be directed to clinical adverse experiences associated with the procedure and the&#xD;
      experimental intervention. In addition, all study participants will be provided a telephone&#xD;
      number they can contact 24 hours/day, 7 days/week in case of questions, concerns, or adverse&#xD;
      events. Adverse events will be documented on a standardized case report form. Summary reports&#xD;
      of adverse events will be generated every three months. Dr. Lechtzin will review these. All&#xD;
      serious adverse events including death, hospitalization, and premature withdrawal will be&#xD;
      reported to the principal investigator within 24 hours of their occurrence. The principal&#xD;
      investigator will report all serious adverse events to the Johns Hopkins IRB. Unexpected&#xD;
      adverse events will be reported within 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Analyses will be based on intention to treat. Analyses will be&#xD;
      performed comparing patients who used NSS to the standard care group and the Music/Photo&#xD;
      group. Descriptive analyses will be performed to assess subject characteristics&#xD;
      (demographics, disease characteristics, education, prior CAM use and attitudes). Procedure&#xD;
      characteristics will be compared including duration, complications, and medication usage.&#xD;
      Continuous variables will be represented as mean plus or minus SE, medians and interquartile&#xD;
      ranges. Bivariate analyses of outcomes will compare pain ratings, POMS subscales, and&#xD;
      psychological distress between the groups. Chi squared test or Fisher's Exact test will be&#xD;
      used to compare categorical variables such as age, gender, and race between groups. Unpaired&#xD;
      t-tests or the Kruskal Wallis test will be used to compare continuous outcomes such as Pain&#xD;
      Inventory scores. Pain scores will be analyzed as continuous variables and will also be&#xD;
      categorized into mild (0-2), moderate (3-6) and severe (7-10). Multivariate analyses will be&#xD;
      performed in order to adjust for possible confounding factors such as amount of narcotic&#xD;
      analgesics given and amount of local anesthetic used. Ordinal logistic regression models to&#xD;
      explain pain level by study intervention will be developed to adjust for factors such as age,&#xD;
      gender, race, procedure type, education level, local anesthetic dose, narcotic dose,&#xD;
      benzodiazepine dose, and BSI score. Additional factors will be included in the models if they&#xD;
      are significant in bivariate analyses. Logistic regression models will be developed to&#xD;
      determine factors associated with favorable response to NSS. Stepwise maximum-likelihood&#xD;
      ratio estimation with a significance level of 0.2 for removal and 0.1 for inclusion will&#xD;
      assist in model development. For all analyses significance will be set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
