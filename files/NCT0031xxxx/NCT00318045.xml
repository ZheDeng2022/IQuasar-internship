  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between optical blur from poor&#xD;
      refractive corrections (glasses) of workers using computers and their productivity and&#xD;
      comfort in the workplace. We believe that improving the visual status of subjects who use&#xD;
      computers will have a beneficial effect on productivity and visual comfort.&#xD;

      The aim of this study is to examine the relationship between optical blur from poor&#xD;
      refractive corrections (glasses) of workers using computers and their productivity and&#xD;
      comfort in the workplace. We believe that improving the visual status of subjects who use&#xD;
      computers will have a beneficial effect on productivity and visual comfort. All subjects will&#xD;
      be required to complete a vision screening at no charge to decide if you qualify for the&#xD;
      study. Subjects will select a frame to be worn during the period of the study. Subjects will&#xD;
      wear either your best correction or your present prescription in the frame for a period of&#xD;
      1-month. This will be a double-blind study, which means that neither the subject nor your&#xD;
      doctors will know which pair of glasses the subjects will be wearing during the parts of the&#xD;
      study. Subjects will complete 4 hours of testing during the first period (4 weeks) then the&#xD;
      lenses will be switched for the second period (4 weeks). During the testing, subjects will&#xD;
      complete two tasks on a standard computer. Either the investigator or co-investigator will&#xD;
      explain to you how to do these simple tasks. One of these tasks will involve looking at&#xD;
      printed material and entering correct information into the computer. The other task involves&#xD;
      finding and deleting apostrophes from a manuscript on the computer. All subjects will answer&#xD;
      a short survey before and after these tasks to check on symptoms resulting from using the&#xD;
      computer. Before and after each period, the subjects also will answer another survey to&#xD;
      measure their visual functioning using these glasses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following periodic measurements will be made during the study: productivity and accuracy&#xD;
      to enter a list of state populations, and a search for apostrophes (') in a document on one&#xD;
      of the states of the U.S. These tasks will require 4 hours testing with each of the two pairs&#xD;
      of trial glasses for two periods (each period lasts for one month). Subjects will be asked to&#xD;
      return to the clinic for 4 hrs during the first 4-week period and for 4 more hrs during the&#xD;
      second 4-week period. At each visit subjects will be asked if they have experienced any&#xD;
      undesirable reactions and will complete a short survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will also be required to complete a short 9-question survey to determine their&#xD;
      visual comfort before and after 1-hour of work on their own computer at your home or job&#xD;
      during each 1-month period of the study. These short phone surveys will take less than&#xD;
      5-minutes to complete and will be arranged at the subject's convenience before and after the&#xD;
      subjects are going to be working on your computer for at least 1-hr. This survey will be&#xD;
      repeated on five occasions. Finally, 3-months after the experimental portion of the study is&#xD;
      completed, all subjects will be required to also answer the same short 9-question survey as&#xD;
      you work on your computer. This will also be a phone survey and will be completed on three&#xD;
      occasions before and after 1-hr of work on their own computer at home or job.&#xD;
