  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      With the introduction of the National Insurance Law in Israel in 1995, there have been&#xD;
      increased efforts to reduce hospitalization in general and length of stay in the hospital in&#xD;
      particular. Under nourished patients have been shown to have a longer mean length of stay and&#xD;
      they are more likely to suffer from complications, which significantly increase cost of care.&#xD;
      Intense nutritional intervention programs, aimed at decreasing rehospitalizations and post&#xD;
      hospitalization complications, are not clearly currently included in the basket of services&#xD;
      provided under the law. Nutritional intervention has been shown to be clinically efficacious&#xD;
      and cost-effective. Demonstration of the benefits of such intervention, both in terms of&#xD;
      reduced expenditures and quality of care, may open a path for specific nutritional&#xD;
      intervention programs that are needed for older persons during and after discharge from Acute&#xD;
      Care. Given the effort made to reduce the length of hospitalization time, even in frail&#xD;
      elderly patients, it is clear that full scale nutritional intervention cannot be completed&#xD;
      during their hospitalization. Therefore, there is a need to create continuity between&#xD;
      in-patient and follow-up nutritional intervention. This combined policy has the potential to&#xD;
      improve general health, reduce the rates of under nutrition and its associated complications,&#xD;
      and thus reduce future hospitalization, along with the mortality and morbidity associated. It&#xD;
      is plausible that improved general health and less frequent hospitalization will eventuate in&#xD;
      cost reduction and allow the intervention to be cost effective. Furthermore, the descriptive&#xD;
      information regarding the nutritional status of older patients admitted to an Acute Care&#xD;
      department may be important for policy makers in their development of nutritional&#xD;
      intervention programs to support the elderly before, during and after hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that multidisciplinary nutritional intervention, during and following&#xD;
      hospitalization, will improve dietary intake and nutritional status. Improvement in&#xD;
      nutritional status will, in turn, cut health care costs by decreasing the use of health&#xD;
      services. In-hospital nutritional care will be beneficial, but combined in-hospital and&#xD;
      community care will be more clinically efficacious and more cost effective in the long run.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hospitalized elderly are susceptible to under nutrition, affecting their clinical course and&#xD;
      outcome. We recently found 30% under nutrition in 200 inpatients aged 65 and older.&#xD;
      Interestingly few, if any, of these patients recieved nutritional intervention while&#xD;
      hospitalized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: 1. To develop models for nutritional intervention among under nourished elderly&#xD;
      inpatients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. To determine the impact of the intervention programs and compare them to standard care.&#xD;
      Prospective outcomes include health care use, health and nutritional status and dietary&#xD;
      intake in the year following hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. To assess the cost-effectiveness and clinical feasibility of the nutritional interventions&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients over 70 years of age, admitted to the Internal Medicine Department at&#xD;
      Soroka University Hospital will be screened for nutritional risk. Patients at risk will be&#xD;
      randomly allocated to 3 groups: standard care, in-hospital intensive intervention and&#xD;
      in-hospital and community intensive intervention. In the year following their&#xD;
      hospitalization, health status, health care use, quality of life and nutritional status will&#xD;
      be assessed using validated tools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance of the study: Under nourished patients are at increased risk for medical&#xD;
      complications and increased duration of hospitalization, both of which raise the cost of&#xD;
      care. Intensive nutritional intervention may reduce length of stay and thus costs. A&#xD;
      formalized intervention plan is crucial for efficacious cost-effective care. We feel that&#xD;
      acute hospitalization is a window of opportunity for initiating long-term nutritional advice&#xD;
      and follow-up.&#xD;
