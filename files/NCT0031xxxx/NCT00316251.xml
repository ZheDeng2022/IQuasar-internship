    <textblock>
      Acute and chronic equilibrium disorders result in over five million patient visits per year&#xD;
      in the United States with unknown additional individuals not seeking care. Symptoms of&#xD;
      dizziness, vertigo, and lack of balance are among the most common symptoms reported to&#xD;
      physicians. Equilibrium disorders not exclusively due to visual or vestibular conditions are&#xD;
      typically due to problems in proprioception. Proprioception is the specialized sensory&#xD;
      modality that informs the body as to movement, position, and spatial orientation through&#xD;
      mechanisms that track sensations accompanying joint movement and position. Mechanoreceptors&#xD;
      in joints, along with vestibular, visual, muscle spindle, Golgi tendon organ, ligament and&#xD;
      tendon sensory receptors, comprise the propriosensory system, which conveys information to&#xD;
      the motor system to maintain equilibrium on a reflexive, automatic basis. Alterations in&#xD;
      somatosensory input from mechanoreceptors have been identified as causing aberrant muscle&#xD;
      firing patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NeuroCom Balance Master is an FDA approved device designed to both measure and treat&#xD;
      balance problems and evaluate the neuromuscular control by quantifying the ability to&#xD;
      maintain dynamic postural stability. The NeuroCom Unit is a microprocessor controlled balance&#xD;
      unit that provides quantitative data regarding the patient's ability to control the platform.&#xD;
      This unit is widely used throughout the country in both university and clinical settings to&#xD;
      help patients restore their balance.&#xD;
