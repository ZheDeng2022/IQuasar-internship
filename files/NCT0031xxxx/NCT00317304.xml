      Stress appears to be related to hot flash frequency and intensity, and the degree of distress&#xD;
      that women experience from their hot flashes appears to be related to their coping resources.&#xD;
      This trial is a pilot study to test the effect of participation in a mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
      reduction program on hot flash frequency and intensity, as well as menopause-related quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of women experience vasomotor symptoms (VMS) such as hot flashes (HF) and night&#xD;
      sweats as they transition through menopause, and a substantial minority experience&#xD;
      considerable distress and diminished role functioning. Until recently most women found relief&#xD;
      through hormone therapy (HT), but concern about the health risks associated with HT has left&#xD;
      women with few effective and safe choices for relief from their symptoms other than their own&#xD;
      coping strategies. A variety of results from both population and laboratory studies suggest&#xD;
      that stress and HF are correlated and that HF are more severe in women with lower coping&#xD;
      abilities, but evidence is far from conclusive. Consequently, investigators have called for&#xD;
      trials to evaluate the effect of stress reduction interventions on HF. Mindfulness-Based&#xD;
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) is a widely available manualized program shown to be an effective&#xD;
      adjunctive intervention in reducing medical symptoms and psychological distress for a wide&#xD;
      range of stress-related disorders. In a small preliminary study using MBSR we found&#xD;
      reductions in HF severity scores and increases in menopause-related quality of life (QOL).&#xD;
      This R21 proposal is for a pilot randomized trial of MBSR compared to a wait-list control&#xD;
      group for 120 menopausal women experiencing seven or more HF/day of moderate to severe&#xD;
      intensity. It aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. assess feasibility of recruitment, adherence to program intervention, and compliance&#xD;
           with assessment instruments in preparation for a larger RCT; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. provide preliminary estimates of efficacy of the effects of MBSR in reducing&#xD;
           self-reported HF frequency and intensity and improving QOL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, we will use sternal skin conductance as an established objective measure of VMS&#xD;
      in a subgroup of 15 women in each arm to test feasibility and obtain information on how&#xD;
      objectively measured HF are related to self-reported HF in this setting. Women will be&#xD;
      assessed at baseline, at the end of the eight-week MBSR course, and at three months after the&#xD;
      end of the course. A secondary aim is to explore whether treatment group differences of HF&#xD;
      frequency and intensity and QOL are explained by changes in perceived stress, health-related&#xD;
      locus of control and mindfulness. It is anticipated that results from this pilot study will&#xD;
      provide data needed to plan a larger more definitive randomized trial on the effect of MBSR&#xD;
      on HF frequency and intensity and on the ability to cope with these symptoms.&#xD;
