  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sarcoidosis is a rare disease that can affect any organ in the body. It is characterized by&#xD;
      the buildup of immune-system (fights off infection in the body) cells in organs. These cells&#xD;
      form small groups called granulomas, which lead to inflammation of the surrounding tissue.&#xD;
      Sarcoidosis most commonly affects the lung and the lymph nodes (part of the immune system).&#xD;
      The signs usually include shortness of breath, fever, dry cough, and chest pain. Other signs&#xD;
      in many patients can include redness and painful lumps on the skin, reduced eyesight, joint&#xD;
      pain, and rarely, nervous system damage. Sarcoidosis commonly affects young and middle-aged&#xD;
      adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no approved therapies for the treatment of sarcoidosis. Corticosteroid (steroid&#xD;
      hormone) therapy is considered the standard treatment. Only limited benefit has been shown&#xD;
      when using corticosteroid therapy to ease lung symptoms or improve lung function in patients&#xD;
      with sarcoidosis. Also, the effects of other therapies (for example: methotrexate,&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide, anti-malarial drugs, thalidomide) and other immunosuppressants (drugs that&#xD;
      suppress a body's natural defense system [immune system]) which have been used in a small&#xD;
      number of patients are not well known and can cause long term problems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug used in this study is called adalimumab. Adalimumab is FDA (Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration) approved for patients with moderately to severely active rheumatoid&#xD;
      arthritis. However, adalimumab is not approved for the treatment of sarcoidosis. Adalimumab&#xD;
      is experimental in this study. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      effectiveness of adalimumab in the treatment of patients with sarcoidosis with pulmonary&#xD;
      (lung) involvement who show symptoms of the disease even though they are currently being&#xD;
      treated with medication.&#xD;

      This study consists of 11 visits (including screening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A chest radiograph (PA and lateral) must be obtained within 3 months prior to the first study&#xD;
      injection. It must indicate that subject is free of tuberculosis (TB). The chest radiograph&#xD;
      will also be used to confirm the stage of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically proven sarcoidosis will be confirmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data, a complete medical history (including signs and symptoms of sarcoidosis), a&#xD;
      physical examination (including vital signs, weight and height). The medical history will&#xD;
      include questions about history of recent TB and history of close contact with persons who&#xD;
      might have TB. Concomitant medications, including the use of oral corticosteroids and&#xD;
      immunosuppressants, will be reviewed and recorded. In addition the inclusion and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria will be reviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A tuberculin skin test will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A serum pregnancy test will be performed for all women within the 4-week period prior to the&#xD;
      Baseline (Week 0) Visit. All women must test negative for pregnancy at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ATS dyspnea score will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 6-minute walk test will be performed with Borg's CR10 dyspnea score obtained before and&#xD;
      after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function tests [PFTs] (spirometry) will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples for routine laboratory analyses will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AE monitoring will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who qualify for the study should be assigned to receive treatment within 14 days of&#xD;
      the screening visit except if additional time is required for repeat TB skin testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should still meet all of the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria&#xD;
      at the time of the baseline visit before starting the injections. Subjects must agree to use&#xD;
      appropriate contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The procedures involved at all study visits are described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screening Visit): Subjects will be asked to review this consent form and discuss with the&#xD;
      study doctor or study staff any questions they may have&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Health and Medication Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screen, Weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 24, 30, 36, 45, 52): Subjects will be asked to answer questions&#xD;
      about their health, their medical history, and the medications they take.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical Exam:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screen, Weeks 6, 24, 52): Do a physical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vital Signs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screen, Weeks 0, 6, 12, 24, 52): Blood Pressure, Pulse, Temperature&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height and Weight:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screen, Week 52)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screen, Weeks 12, 24, 45, 52): Approximately 3 teaspoons of blood will be drawn from a vein&#xD;
      in subject's hand or arm for these tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lung Function Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screen, Weeks 24, 52): Subject will be given a mouthpiece and asked to take deep breaths&#xD;
      into a machine connected to a computer according to the cues of a staff member. The machine&#xD;
      will measure the capacity of subject's lungs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Chest X-ray:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screen, Weeks 12, 24, 52):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tuberculosis Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screen only): Subject will be asked specific questions regarding their history of&#xD;
      tuberculosis (also called TB: a type of bacterial lung infection) or personal contact with&#xD;
      people with active tuberculosis. Subjects with active tuberculosis cannot be in the study.&#xD;
      Subjects will be given a skin test for tuberculosis. For all subjects in this trial, a TB&#xD;
      skin test with negative results must be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  6 Minute Walk Test: (Screen, Weeks 0, 12, 24, 52): Subject will be asked to complete a&#xD;
           test where they will walk for 6 minutes. Subject will be asked specific questions&#xD;
           regarding any shortness of breath they have.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy Test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Screen only): A pregnancy blood test will be performed on all women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential at the screening visit. The results of the test must be negative in order for&#xD;
      subject to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECG:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Week 0 only)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Weeks 0, 2, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 45): Subject will receive study drug at the Week 0 Visit&#xD;
      and be taught how to give themselves injections. Subject will be given a supply of study drug&#xD;
      and clinical supplies that will last until the next study visit. Subject will be required to&#xD;
      return all unused study drug as well as the packaging for the used study drug at each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (Weeks 0, 2, 12, 18, 24, 30, 36, 45): Prior to receiving any study drug, subject will be&#xD;
      asked questions about their symptoms and quality of life, including their ability to care for&#xD;
      themselves and carry out normal everyday activities (respiratory and health surveys) and&#xD;
      health questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will return for efficacy and safety evaluations at each time point including&#xD;
      week 52, whether or not they complete the entire treatment schedule and whether or not they&#xD;
      are (still) responding to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will watch carefully for signs and symptoms of CHF and active TB at follow-up evaluations&#xD;
      for all patients. The study agent will be stopped in subjects who are found to have NYHA&#xD;
      Class III or IV CHF, severe right-sided heart failure, cor pulmonale, and/or active TB after&#xD;
      enrollment in the study but they must return for further follow-up evaluations.&#xD;

The borg scale ranges from zero to 10 with zero being no breathlessness at all and 10 being maximal breathlessness. A change between screening and week 24 is reported.</description>
