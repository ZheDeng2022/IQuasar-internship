  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial seeks to accomplish both local and regional control of head and neck cancer and&#xD;
      reduce systemic metastatic disease. To do this, patients will received chemotherapy followed&#xD;
      by chemotherapy and radiation (given together) with an escalating dose of docetaxel.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The majority of head and neck cancer patients present with more advanced stages III or IV&#xD;
      disease. The treatment of cancers of the head and neck can have profound consequences with&#xD;
      regard to functional abilities such as speech and eating. In the treatment of both locally&#xD;
      advanced HNSCC and sites where organ preservation is desirable, radiation therapy has been a&#xD;
      major method of treatment. However, as a single modality, radiation therapy can cure fewer&#xD;
      than 30% of patients with advanced disease. Attempts to improve the outcome of locally&#xD;
      advanced HNSCC have generally added chemotherapy to radiotherapy. However, the optimal manner&#xD;
      to integrate chemotherapy into the plan of care has been controversial. Chemotherapy has been&#xD;
      used most commonly as either induction therapy preceding radiation, or more recently as&#xD;
      concomitant therapy along with radiation. Induction chemotherapy has been associated with&#xD;
      high response rates of 60-90%, but no significant change in loco-regional control or&#xD;
      survival.Clinical trials incorporating chemotherapy with concurrent radiation have recently&#xD;
      generated considerable interest. To accomplish both loco-regional control and reduce systemic&#xD;
      metastasis, this trial proposes induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant&#xD;
      chemotherapy-radiation with an escalating dose of docetaxel in patients with locally advanced&#xD;
      previously untreated HNSCC.&#xD;
