  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We, the researchers at the Indiana University School of Medicine, are doing this study to&#xD;
      better understand how the effects of certain medications are altered when taken&#xD;
      simultaneously, or in combination with each other. We will also look at how each volunteer's&#xD;
      genes (DNA) may affect the way these medications are metabolized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will test the hypothesis that the extent of drug-drug interaction caused by the&#xD;
      combination of erythromycin and diltiazem is not predictable from the extent of interaction&#xD;
      produced by each inhibitor alone. Specifically we will test the hypothesis that the&#xD;
      combination of erythromycin and diltiazem will cause a greater decrease in midazolam&#xD;
      intravenous and oral clearance than the sum of the decreases caused by each inhibitor alone.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many drugs such as diltiazem are metabolized by CYP3A4, the cytochrome P450 enzyme&#xD;
      responsible for the metabolism of erythromycin and when given together, the possibility&#xD;
      exists that one drug inhibits the metabolism of the other leading to an increase in plasma&#xD;
      concentration. The magnitude of this interaction is not known. It is therefore important to&#xD;
      define this effect because diltiazem is a drug that is used commonly to treat hypertension,&#xD;
      angina and atrial fibrillation and these patients may be given erythromycin for the treatment&#xD;
      of intercurrent bacterial infections.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Approximately 45 healthy volunteers may be recruited to participate in the study, with a&#xD;
        goal of 15 healthy volunteers (7 or 8 males) completing the entire four phases. All&#xD;
        potential subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must be a non-smoker&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Between 18 to 50 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a body mass index of 30 or less&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Must be willing to undergo a screening physical examination and proven to be free from&#xD;
             metabolic, cardiac, pulmonary, renal or hepatic dysfunction as determined by the&#xD;
             screening physical, medical history, 12-lead electrocardiography, and laboratory&#xD;
             values which include: a CMP (complete metabolic profile), a CBC/diff/plt (complete&#xD;
             blood count with differential and platelet count), serum pregnancy test (if&#xD;
             applicable), and UA (urinalysis). Also, given the uncertain effects of these drugs on&#xD;
             the fetus and the fact that hormonal contraceptives are prohibited, the female&#xD;
             subjects should be on two other forms of birth control (e.g. condom, contraceptive&#xD;
             foam).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Potential volunteers will be excluded:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. If they have allergies or are hypersensitive to any of the study medications:&#xD;
&#xD;
             A. Midazolam (Versed) or related benzodiazepines drugs such as diazepam (Valium) or&#xD;
             alprazolam (Xanax).&#xD;
&#xD;
             B. Diltiazem (Cardizem, Dilacor) or related calcium channel blockers such as verapamil&#xD;
             (Calan, Isoptin).&#xD;
&#xD;
             C. Erythromycin (Erythrocin, E-mycin, Ery-tab) or related antibiotics such as&#xD;
             clarithromycin (Biaxin) or have experienced abdominal pain when taking erythromycin or&#xD;
             other related medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. If they are taking any prescription medication on a regular basis including&#xD;
             contraceptives such as oral birth control pills, transdermal patches or injections&#xD;
             (Depo-Provera).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If they are taking over-the-counter medications, any herbal or dietary supplement&#xD;
             (including Benadryl, Sudafed, St. John's wort, herbal teas, vitamins and garlic&#xD;
             supplements) that cannot be stopped for the study duration. Use of over-the-counter&#xD;
             drugs for the treatment of minor, short-lived (2 to 3 days) symptoms may be allowable&#xD;
             (such as Tylenol) but must first be approved by a study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. If they have donated blood within the past two months, or are anemic (have a&#xD;
             hemoglobin level less than 12.5 mg/dl).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. If they weigh less than 52 kg, or have a BMI (Body Mass Index) greater than 32.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. If they have a screening or baseline EKG reading that is abnormal or could place them&#xD;
             at higher risk as decided by the study doctors (baseline corrected QT interval in the&#xD;
             EKG of 450 msec or greater or a baseline PR interval in the EKG of 210 msec or&#xD;
             greater).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. If they have a history of bradycardia or consistently have a heart rate less than 55&#xD;
             beats per minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. If they have any history of heart disease or have a family medical history of sudden&#xD;
             death (heart stopping suddenly without warning).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. If they have a history of psychiatric problems that may be exacerbated by&#xD;
             participation in this study, or if the subject can not state a good understanding of&#xD;
             this study's risks and requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. If they have a positive serum pregnancy test during the screening process or have a&#xD;
             positive urine pregnancy test (UPT) which will be obtained just prior to each of the&#xD;
             four study phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. If they are currently breastfeeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. If they have participated in any other study in which they have taken a research&#xD;
             medication within the past three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. If they have a history of alcohol or drug abuse, or have used tobacco or marijuana&#xD;
             within the past three months.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. If they are unwilling or unable to refrain from using drugs, alcohol, or any food&#xD;
             listed on the exclusion list below during this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. If they are an employee or student under the supervision of any study investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. If they are unwilling or unable to follow the study rules.&#xD;
