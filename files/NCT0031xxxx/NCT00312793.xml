  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Myospare, a non-invasive&#xD;
      device, which is connected to the body via electrodes placed in the injured leg. The&#xD;
      electrodes which are placed in the middle or upper thigh will stimulate the quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Myospare will be installed 1 day after the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) reconstruction&#xD;
      surgery and will be removed after 6 weeks of treatment. The patients will be assigned to two&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Physiotherapy plus Myospare&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Only physiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that electrical stimulation combined with voluntary exercise&#xD;
      is more effective than voluntary exercise alone.&#xD;
