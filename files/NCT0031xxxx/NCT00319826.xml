  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate why some people develop life-threatening&#xD;
      infections caused by the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, while other people do not. It is&#xD;
      possible that the infectious ability of the bacteria can determine whether an infection&#xD;
      develops and its severity. The investigators will look at old blood and nasal specimens&#xD;
      collected from 1000 adults who had S. aureus infections and who were hospitalized at Duke&#xD;
      University Medical Center. Previously collected health information regarding these patients&#xD;
      and the specific bacterial traits in the samples will be studied. Eventually this information&#xD;
      may be used to help treat and prevent S. aureus infection.&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to more thoroughly investigate the impact of bacterial genetic&#xD;
      characteristics on the outcome of patients with S. aureus bacteremia (SAB). The investigators&#xD;
      will address salient aspects of bacterial virulence using strong collaborative relationships&#xD;
      with authorities in bacterial genetics and genomics. The overall hypothesis of this&#xD;
      investigation is that distinct bacterial virulence determinants influence the severity of S.&#xD;
      aureus infection. The specific hypothesis is that virulence determinants associated with&#xD;
      clinical outcome of S. aureus infection segregate into clonal groups, identified by&#xD;
      Multilocus Sequence Typing (MLST), and can be localized in the genome by comparative genetic&#xD;
      hybridization (CGH). The investigators have established the following aims to pursue this&#xD;
      hypothesis. Specific Aim 1: Define the allelic diversity of S. aureus bloodstream isolates&#xD;
      using MSLT. Allelic profiles among the 1000 isolates will be compared using the program BURST&#xD;
      (Based Upon Related Sequence Type), and relatedness of lineages in the overall collection&#xD;
      will be defined. Specific Aim 2: Define the genomic diversity of S. aureus bloodstream&#xD;
      isolates using CGH. Using MLST results, a subset of 200 isolates will be selected to undergo&#xD;
      further study. These ~200 isolates will form a unique collection hereafter referred to as the&#xD;
      SAGA (S. aureus genomic analysis) collection. The genomic diversity of the SAGA subset will&#xD;
      be defined using CGH. Specific Aim 3: Correlate MLST and CGH results, MLST and clinical&#xD;
      outcome, and CGH, and clinical outcome, and make SAGA isolates available to the scientific&#xD;
      community. In this Specific Aim, the discriminate ability of MLST and CGH will be compared&#xD;
      among the SAGA subset isolates undergoing both assays. The association between bacterial&#xD;
      clonality and clinical outcome will be considered among 1000 S. aureus isolates collected&#xD;
      from adults at Duke University Medical Center who had S. aureus infections undergoing MLST.&#xD;
      The association between clinical outcome and the presence or absence of virulence factors and&#xD;
      pathogenicity islands in the S. aureus genome will also be considered among the 200 SAGA&#xD;
      subset isolates undergoing CGH. The products of this study will include an increased&#xD;
      understanding of genetic diversity in S. aureus and the role of this genetic diversity on&#xD;
      determining the severity of infections caused by S. aureus. The full value of the current&#xD;
      proposal also includes the potential future benefit to the research community as a whole if&#xD;
      associations between pathogen genotype and clinical outcome, only possible to identify using&#xD;
      such a large and clinically well-characterized collection of isolates, can be defined. To&#xD;
      amplify these potential downstream dividends, the final goal of Specific Aim 3 will be to&#xD;
      make SAGA subset isolates, corresponding MLST types, and CGH profiles available to the&#xD;
      scientific community through the repository maintained by the Network for Antimicrobial&#xD;
      Resistance in S. aureus (NARSA). The long-term objectives of this project are to: (1)&#xD;
      identify bacterial genes contributing to the severity of infection in isolates from a large&#xD;
      cohort of patients with SAB; and (2) ultimately use these genes to identify novel&#xD;
      interventions for the control of S. aureus pathogenesis by investigating genes that govern&#xD;
      the virulence of this emerging pathogen. Culture-confirmed SAB nasal carriage isolates and/or&#xD;
      bloodstream bacterial isolates previously collected from 1000 inpatient adults at Duke&#xD;
      University Medical Center will be used in this study.&#xD;

        endocarditis, osteomylitis) that were be identified using the Bloodstream Infections&#xD;
        Registry. No new subjects was or will be enrolled within the current investigation.&#xD;
