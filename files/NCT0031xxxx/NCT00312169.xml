  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, open-label, non-randomized, dual-arm pilot study to investigate the&#xD;
      prevalence of the reverse transcriptase (RT) resistance mutations, K65R/x or L74V/x, in HIV-1&#xD;
      plasma from subjects experiencing confirmed first-time incomplete virologic suppression&#xD;
      during treatment with an initial antiretroviral (ARV) regimen consisting of at least 12 weeks&#xD;
      of TDF or ABC + emtricitabine (FTC) or lamivudine (3TC) + non-nucleoside reverse&#xD;
      transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI) or protease inhibitor (PI). Subjects will be followed until a&#xD;
      substantial loss of virologic or immunologic control requires a treatment switch. Confirmed&#xD;
      first-time incomplete virologic suppression is defined as an initial plasma HIV-1 RNA&#xD;
      response &lt; 400 copies/mL, and subsequent virologic rebound &gt; 400 copies/mL measured at two&#xD;
      consecutive times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will have a screening genotype to establish adherence to their non-suppressive TDF-&#xD;
      or ABC-containing regimen by the presence of M184V (or other treatment-related primary)&#xD;
      mutation and to demonstrate that the evolution of treatment-emergent RT mutations can be&#xD;
      characterized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty subjects (a maximum of 10 per arm) will be enrolled at 10-20 United States (U.S.)&#xD;
      sites. If fewer than 20 subjects can be enrolled, the study may be discontinued early by the&#xD;
      sponsor. Equal numbers of subjects on Arm A versus Arm B will be a goal.&#xD;

           permitted. For non-serious illnesses, treatment of less than 21 days with larger doses&#xD;

           would interfere with adherence to study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serious illness requiring systemic treatment and/or hospitalization until subject either&#xD;
