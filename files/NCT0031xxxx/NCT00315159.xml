      The purpose of this study is to evaluate a less invasive procedure for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      inguinal (groin) nodes in patients with a primary squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. Each&#xD;
      patient will undergo a sentinel lymph node dissection as well as resection of the primary&#xD;
      tumor on the vulva. Patients who are determined to have sentinel nodes that are negative for&#xD;
      metastatic disease will not receive a full groin dissection. Patients who have sentinel lymph&#xD;
      nodes that contain metastasis will undergo a complete inguinal dissection. The study will&#xD;
      evaluate the long-term outcomes in patients who receive only a sentinel lymph node dissection&#xD;
      without a complete dissection. All patients entered onto the study will have a biopsy proven&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. Each patient will be enrolled by a Gynecologic&#xD;
      Oncologist practicing out of Women &amp; Infants Hospital&#xD;

      Conservative Management with Isolated Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy in Vulvar Cancer Patients&#xD;
      with Sentinel Lymph Nodes Determined to be Negative for Metastatic Disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 4000 new cases of vulvar&#xD;
      cancer for the year 2003(1). The majority of these patients will undergo surgical therapy&#xD;
      with groin node dissection to assess the inguinal nodal chain for evidence of metastatic&#xD;
      disease. For many years there has been a search for a less radical surgical approach to&#xD;
      evaluating the inguinal lymphatic basin. The classic approach to vulvar cancer was an en-bloc&#xD;
      resection of the vulva and groins with a single incision. This approach led to complication&#xD;
      rates as high as 69% for chronic leg edema and 85 % for wound breakdown(2). In an effort to&#xD;
      reduce the morbidity of groin node dissections, the triple incision technique was&#xD;
      introduced(3). A GOG study evaluating limited surgery with wide local excision and&#xD;
      superficial groin node dissection reported rates of chronic lymphedema of 19% and wound&#xD;
      infection and or separation of 29%(4). In their report on penile carcinoma the concept of a&#xD;
      sentinel node as the first group of nodes in the inguinal lymphatic chain was put forth by&#xD;
      Cabanas et al.(5). Morton and colleagues advanced the technique of sentinel node lymphatic&#xD;
      mapping in patients with cutaneous melanoma(6). In 1994 Levenback et al, described of the use&#xD;
      of isosulfan blue dye for the detection of sentinel nodes in the inguinal lymphatic chain(7).&#xD;
      To date, a number of studies have been performed evaluating the utility of sentinel node&#xD;
      technology and its application in vulvar malignancies (Table 1)(7-20). For melanoma, the&#xD;
      sentinel node dissection has become the standard of care for the evaluation of the lymphatic&#xD;
      basins. Many cancer centers, including Women and Infants' Hospital, use sentinel node&#xD;
      dissection for the evaluation of axillary nodes in breast cancer patients as their standard&#xD;
      of care. This technology has decreased the rate of chronic arm edema in breast cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inguinal node metastasis in patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva is reported to&#xD;
      be as high as 27%(21). Consequently, a large number of patients may undergo a potentially&#xD;
      morbid procedure without any gain. Non-invasive methods for the evaluation of the&#xD;
      inguinofemoral nodes such as CT, MRI and PET scans have not yet been proven reliable.&#xD;
      Sentinel node biopsy utilizing Tc-99m sulfur colloid and isosulfan blue dye allows for&#xD;
      evaluation of nodal status in patients with vulvar malignancies through minimally invasive&#xD;
      surgery. Our study, at Women and Infants' Hospital, employed Tc-99m sulfur colloid and&#xD;
      isosulfan blue dye to identify sentinel nodes in the inguinal lymphatic chain of patients&#xD;
      with primary squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. Twenty nine patients were enrolled and 107&#xD;
      sentinel nodes were studied with no false negative SLN being reported(22) There are over 175&#xD;
      patients in the reported literature who have undergone a SLN dissection for the evaluation of&#xD;
      the inguinal lymphatic basin for metastatic disease. To date there have been no false&#xD;
      negative SLN reported. We feel the SLN dissection has been proven to be reliable and safe&#xD;
      procedure both at our institution and others around the world. Further studies need to be&#xD;
      performed in order to evaluate the use of SLN dissection alone in patients with pathologic&#xD;
      negative sentinel nodes for metastasis. This study will evaluate the use of sentinel node&#xD;
      dissection alone and management of these patients who potentially do not need or will benefit&#xD;
      from a full inguinal node dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel Node Concept Sentinel node dissection was first applied for the evaluation of&#xD;
      inguinal nodal basins in patients with penile cancer(23). The sentinel node concept is based&#xD;
      on the belief that certain anatomical areas are drained by individual nodal chains with the&#xD;
      first lymph node in this chain being the sentinel node. It has been shown the sentinel node&#xD;
      is predictive of the status of the lymphatic basin for the presence of metastatic disease to&#xD;
      non-sentinel nodes. The use of both lymphazurin blue dye and technetium-99m sulfur colloid&#xD;
      has been shown to reliably identify sentinel nodes in many cancers such ad melanoma, breast&#xD;
      and colon. This technology has also been studied in patients with vulvar malignancies and has&#xD;
      been shown to detect a sentinel node 100% of the time(22). With a limited number of sentinel&#xD;
      nodes obtained from a lymphatic basin a more complete pathologic evaluation of the lymph node&#xD;
      can be performed. The use of ultra-staging (serial sectioning) allows for smaller metastasis&#xD;
      and micrometastasis to be reliably detected. Sentinel lymph node technology will allow for a&#xD;
      more complete surgical and pathologic evaluation of the inguinal lymphatic basins with a&#xD;
      potential benefit of avoiding a complete inguinal node dissection for patients with a SLN&#xD;
      determined to be negative for metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective trial examining conservative management of patients with inguinal&#xD;
      sentinel nodes that have been deemed negative for metastatic disease in patients with primary&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to enroll 100 patients over a 5 year period and follow each for a&#xD;
      total of three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sentinel Lymph Node Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will undergo two intradermal peritumoral injections with a total of 2-3 mCi of&#xD;
      unfiltered technetium-99m sulfur colloid in a volume of 1cc, within 24 hours prior to&#xD;
      surgery. These injections will take place in the nuclear medicine suite at Rhode Island&#xD;
      Hospital under Dr. Richard Noto's supervision. Following the injection of the Tc-99m sulfur&#xD;
      colloid a lymphoscintigram will be performed to detect the presence of a sentinel node.&#xD;
      Intra-operatively, 5 to 10 minutes prior to the groin dissection, 3 cc of isosulfan blue dye&#xD;
      will be injected at the peritumoral edge in a manner and location similar to the Tc-99m&#xD;
      sulfur colloid injection. An inguinal dissection will then performed before the radical&#xD;
      excision of the vulvar tumor. Prior to the groin node incision, a hand held collimated gamma&#xD;
      counter will be used to identify the location of the sentinel node. This area will be marked&#xD;
      with ink on the skin surface. An inguinal incision will be made and the inguinal lymphatic&#xD;
      beds will be dissected to identify blue afferent lymphatic tracts and/or blue stained lymph&#xD;
      nodes. A hand held collimated gamma counter will be used to detect any lymph nodes with&#xD;
      increased activity, defined as a count greater than 5 % of that at the injection site,&#xD;
      through the groin incision. Also, any lymph node with a blue lymphatic tract leading to it or&#xD;
      stained blue will be considered a sentinel node. As well, any lymph node identified with the&#xD;
      hand held gamma counter as taking up the Tc-99m sulfur colloid will be considered a hot&#xD;
      sentinel node. Each sentinel node will be evaluated with a 10 second gamma count and labeled&#xD;
      as hot and blue, hot and non-blue or cold and blue. With completion of the sentinel node&#xD;
      groin node dissection, the lymphatic beds will be re-scanned with the gamma counter to ensure&#xD;
      all sentinel nodes have been removed. Once the SLN groin dissection is complete the incision&#xD;
      will be closed and a full groin dissection will be done at a separate sitting pending the&#xD;
      pathologic evaluation of the sentinel lymph node. The remainder of the surgery for the&#xD;
      treatment of the primary tumor will then be completed with a current standard of care&#xD;
      procedure depending on the size and location of the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pathologic Analysis of Sentinel Lymph Nodes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each sentinel lymph node will be serially sectioned at 2mm intervals parallel to the long&#xD;
      axis and totally submitted for histologic evaluation in one or more blocks. From each block,&#xD;
      five slides will be cut at 100 micron intervals and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. A&#xD;
      parallel slide at each level will be cut and held for batch cytokeratin AE1/AE3&#xD;
      immunohistochemical staining if negative for metastasis by initial H&amp;E staining. The largest&#xD;
      dimension of each metastasis will be measured and recorded in order to track the presence of&#xD;
      micrometastasis defined as a metastatic focus less than 2mm in size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Management Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients enrolled on to the sentinel lymph node protocol will undergo a sentinel lymph node&#xD;
      dissection as described above followed by a radical excision of the primary tumor. Patients&#xD;
      with sentinel nodes found to contain metastatic disease from the primary vulvar malignancy&#xD;
      will under go a complete inguinal lymph node dissection as per standard care. Patients with&#xD;
      sentinel lymph nodes deemed negative for metastatic disease based on ultra-staging and H&amp;E&#xD;
      staining will be followed with conservative management (no further groin node dissection).&#xD;
      Each of these patients will be followed clinically at 3 month intervals for the first three&#xD;
      years for a total study follow up period of three years. Any patient determined to have a&#xD;
      groin recurrence will be treated with current standard of care modalities as appropriate for&#xD;
      their recurrence. Published data documenting a 5-7% unanticipated groin failures in patients&#xD;
      with negative lymphadenectomies will be used as the comparative outcomes (25).&#xD;
