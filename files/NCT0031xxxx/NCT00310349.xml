      PneuMum is a randomised controlled trial that aims to find out if pneumococcal vaccination&#xD;
      for Australian Indigenous mothers, in the last few months of pregnancy or at delivery, can&#xD;
      prevent ear disease in infants. Mothers will receive the 23 valent pneumococcal&#xD;
      polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) either: a) during the third trimester of pregnancy; b) soon&#xD;
      after child birth; or c) seven months after child birth (control group). The adult&#xD;
      diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (dTPa) will be used as the control&#xD;
      vaccine for the birth dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to recruit 210 Indigenous women aged 18-39 years who have an uncomplicated&#xD;
      pregnancy. Following recruitment, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of the three&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each mother and infant will be followed from pregnancy until the baby is seven months of age.&#xD;
      Children will receive all of their routinely recommended vaccinations in accordance with the&#xD;
      standard vaccination schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be prevalence of ear infection at seven months of age, defined as&#xD;
      middle ear effusion or tympanic membrane perforation or acute otitis media. Pneumatic&#xD;
      otoscopy, video-otoscopy and tympanometry will be used in the ear examinations. The primary&#xD;
      analyses will be a direct comparison of the proportion of infants in the control group who&#xD;
      have nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine type pneumococci at seven months of age compared to&#xD;
      infants in each of the other two groups and a similar comparison of the proportion with&#xD;
      middle ear disease.&#xD;

      PneuMum is a randomised controlled trial that aims to find out if pneumococcal vaccination&#xD;
      for Australian Indigenous mothers, in the last few months of pregnancy or at delivery, can&#xD;
      prevent ear disease in infants. Two vaccines will be used in this trial:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV), is currently recommended for&#xD;
           all Indigenous people in the Northern Territory from 15 years of age but uptake among&#xD;
           women of child-bearing age has been low.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adult diphtheria, tetanus and acellular pertussis vaccine (dTPa) will be used as the&#xD;
           control vaccine. This vaccine is recommended for all new parents who have not previously&#xD;
           been immunised but is not currently funded so would normally need to be purchased on&#xD;
           prescription through a pharmacist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indigenous children experience the highest rates of acute and chronic ear infections in the&#xD;
      world, resulting in permanent ear damage, hearing loss and educational disadvantage. These&#xD;
      infections are mainly bacterial. Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) is the predominant&#xD;
      pathogen. Pneumococcal colonisation and infection begins within days of birth, months before&#xD;
      any potential immunological protection from infant pneumococcal conjugate vaccine may be&#xD;
      expected. New strategies are needed to eliminate, or at least delay, this early-onset&#xD;
      pneumococcal colonisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maternal vaccination with the 23 valent pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine (23vPPV) during&#xD;
      pregnancy or at delivery is one strategy that may protect newborn infants through mechanisms&#xD;
      such as transplacental antibody transfer, increased secretory antibody in breast milk, and/or&#xD;
      by reducing nasopharyngeal carriage (and transmission to the infant) of maternal pneumococci.&#xD;
      Previous small studies using this strategy have been encouraging, but there have been no&#xD;
      studies properly evaluating nasopharyngeal carriage or disease endpoints in infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to recruit 210 Indigenous women aged 18-39 years who have an uncomplicated pregnancy.&#xD;
      Following recruitment, subjects will be randomly assigned to one of three groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A will receive 23vPPV in the last few months of pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B will receive 23vPPV soon after childbirth&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C will receive 23vPPV seven months after childbirth (the control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women in Groups A and C will receive dTPa soon after childbirth (to conceal the intervention&#xD;
      groups), whereas women in Group C will be offered dTpa seven months after childbirth (end of&#xD;
      the observation period).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be visited at least five times:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During the last few months of pregnancy (30-36 weeks gestation)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The group of mothers receiving 23vPPV at this visit will also have a sample taken&#xD;
                of their blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. At Royal Darwin Hospital when the baby is born&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each mother will receive either 23vPPV or dTpa depending on their allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each mother will have a sample taken of their blood, the cord blood, a&#xD;
                nasopharyngeal swab and a sample of expressed breast milk&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. When the baby is one month old&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each baby will have their ears checked and a nasopharyngeal swab taken. A swab will&#xD;
                also be taken of any discharge from the baby's ear/s. Mothers will be asked for&#xD;
                sample of expressed breast milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. When the baby is two months old&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The same checks and samples as the previous month.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. When the baby is seven months old&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Each mother and baby will have the same checks and samples as the previous months.&#xD;
                Babies will also have a sample taken of their blood. Mothers who have not yet had&#xD;
                23vPPV will be offered that vaccine as will those who have not yet had dTpa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be prevalence of ear infection at seven months of age, defined as&#xD;
      middle ear effusion or tympanic membrane perforation or acute otitis media. Pneumatic&#xD;
      otoscopy, video-otoscopy and tympanometry will be used in the ear examinations. The primary&#xD;
      analyses will be a direct comparison of the proportion of infants in the control group (Group&#xD;
      C) who have nasopharyngeal carriage of vaccine type pneumococci at seven months of age&#xD;
      compared to infants in each of the other two groups and a similar comparison of the&#xD;
      proportion with middle ear disease.&#xD;
