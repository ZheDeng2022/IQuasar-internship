      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the soft tissue clinical results in patients that&#xD;
      received, or not, a soft tissue augmentation around dental implant inserted immediately after&#xD;
      the extraction.&#xD;

      After being informed about the study and potential risks, all patients giving written&#xD;
      informed consent will undergo a screening period to determinate eligibility for study entry.&#xD;
      Patients who meet eligibility requirements will be randomized in this single&#xD;
      blinded(investigator) study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (Test) will receive immediate implant after extraction and a soft tissue augmentation&#xD;
      with a collagen matrix.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group (Control) will receive only immediate implant after extraction without soft tissue&#xD;
      augmentation.&#xD;

    <measure>Soft Tissue Thickness (STT)</measure>
    <time_frame>T0a: baseline before surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Measured at 3 and 6 mm from the free gingival margin using a 15-endodontic file and a rubber disk. The file will advance perpendicularly through the soft tissue until the first point of bone contact. Thickness will be measured to the nearest 0.1 mm using a caliper. The rubber disk stop will be then placed in tight contact with the soft tissue surface and fixed with a drop of cyanocrylic adhesive. After file removal, the distance between file tip and the silicon stop will be measured using a digital caliper with 0.01 mm of accuracy. (Cairo et al. 2017; Bittner et al. 2020)</description>

    <measure>Assessment of the linear volumetric changes</measure>
    <time_frame>T0a: baseline before surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Impressions of the grafted sites will be taken including at least the two neighboring teeth and using a silicone impression material. Dental stone casts will be fabricated and optically scanned with a desktop 3D scanner. Digital models of each time-point per patient will be captured as stereolithography (STL) files. The images of the baseline and follow-up datasets will be superimposed and matched using the best-fit algorithm at the adjacent tooth surfaces. After definition of specific regions of interest (ROI), the software will calculated the volumetric changes measured in mm, which will correspond to the mean distance between the three surfaces representing the evaluated time-points. One buccal ROI will be defined: a trapezoid shape area between the gingival margins of the adjacent teeth, the mucogingival junction as apical and the interproximal areas as lateral borders. The measured will be kept constant in each patient and site over time. (Zeltner 2017)</description>

    <measure>Pink Esthetic Score (PES)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1: 2 weeks after crown delivery, 4 months from surgery</time_frame>
    <description>PES is based on seven variables: mesial papilla, distal papilla, soft-tissue level, soft- tissue contour, alveolar process deficiency, soft-tissue colour and texture. Each variable will be assessed with a 2-1-0 score, with 2 being the best and 0 being the poorest score. The papillae values will be evaluated for completeness, incompleteness or absence. Other variables will be assessed by comparison with a reference tooth. The highest possible score reflecting a perfect match of the peri-implant soft tissue with that of the reference tooth will be 14. (Furhauser et al. 2005)</description>

It will be set as the distance between the reference point and the most apical point of contact between the implant surface and the bone. The reference point will be the fixture-abutment interface. Digital intraoral periapical radiographs will be taken using a parallel cone technique with digital sensor. A paralleling device and individualized bite blocks made of polyvinyl siloxane impression material will be used for the standardization of the X-ray geometry. Calibration will be performed using the known thread-pitch distance of the implants. Measurements will be taken to the nearest millimeter using computer software.</description>
