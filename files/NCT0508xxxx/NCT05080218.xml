      The COVID-19 VaccinE Response in Rheumatology patients (COVER) study is a multicenter&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of a mRNA COVID-19&#xD;
      vaccine supplemental dose (booster) in patients with autoimmune conditions and to evaluate&#xD;
      the impact of different immunomodulatory therapies on vaccine response. The investigators&#xD;
      propose to recruit up to 1000- patients with autoimmune conditions who have a completed&#xD;
      2-dose regime of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (&gt;28 days prior) and who are planning to receive an&#xD;
      additional dose of mRNA COVID-19 vaccine (i.e., booster). Participants in this study will be&#xD;
      men and women 18 years and older with confirmed rheumatic disease, including psoriatic&#xD;
      arthritis (PsA), axial spondyloarthritis (SpA) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who express a&#xD;
      decision to receive the mRNA vaccination booster within 30 days post enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A primary objective of this study is to test the hypothesis that holding certain medications&#xD;
      for a brief period of time around the time of COVID-19 vaccination might improve the response&#xD;
      to the vaccine while not unduly having safety concerns with respect to the effects of their&#xD;
      disease. During the study, participants using the immunomodulatory therapies described&#xD;
      outlined in protocol will be randomized to temporarily hold (for 2 weeks) versus continue&#xD;
      after they receive the COVID-19 vaccine supplemental dose. Patients who temporarily stop one&#xD;
      of their medications for their autoimmune inflammatory disease may be at increased risk of&#xD;
      flares of their autoimmune condition. If these occur, they are expected to occur within 2 - 4&#xD;
      weeks of treatment interruption. Detailed protocol outlines the hold schedules for the&#xD;
      therapies to be randomized in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to determine the immunogenicity and safety of COVID-19 vaccines in&#xD;
      people living with rheumatic disease on immunomodulatory therapies. Given the experience with&#xD;
      influenza, pneumococcal, shingles, and other vaccinations in rheumatic disease populations,&#xD;
      it is clear that disease modifying therapies (DMARDs) and the immunomodulatory therapies used&#xD;
      to treat immune-mediated inflammatory diseases have the capacity to blunt immune responses to&#xD;
      vaccinations. A number of mostly small studies have examined the optimal management of DMARDs&#xD;
      with regard to the timing of vaccination in order to maximize the immunogenicity of various&#xD;
      vaccines, with immunogenicity serving as a lab-based proxy for clinical effectiveness. As&#xD;
      various development programs near completion with regard to a vaccine for SARS-CoV-2 virus,&#xD;
      it will be imperative to understand how best to vaccinate immunosuppressed patients, and in&#xD;
      particular, to optimize vaccine response resulting from a supplemental (booster) dose in&#xD;
      those patients using immunomodulatory biologic and targeted small molecule therapies. In&#xD;
      concert with the American College of Rheumatology's (ACR) task force focused on developing&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccination guidance, the proposed real-world study will address major knowledge&#xD;
      gaps that exist with the SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in rheumatic disease patients who have not&#xD;
      been included in vaccine studies. Currently, the ACR task force for COVID-19 vaccination&#xD;
      guidance recommends that patients temporarily (1-2 weeks) stop one of their medications for&#xD;
      their autoimmune inflammatory disease. However, it is not known if stopping medications may&#xD;
      increase risk of flares in their autoimmune condition. If these occur, they are expected to&#xD;
      occur within 2-4 weeks of treatment interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 1000 patients will be studied to address these questions about the vaccine&#xD;
      response following supplemental (booster) dosing associated with the use of upadacitinib,&#xD;
      baricitinib, abatacept, canakinumab, secukinumab, ixekizumab, tofacitinib, TNFi, guselkumab&#xD;
      (conditional on resource availability), and ustekinumab (conditional on resource&#xD;
      availability). Participants will be randomized to hold these treatments for two weeks, or to&#xD;
      continue their medication without interruption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives and Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conduct a large, randomized controlled trial to evaluate SARS-CoV-2 vaccine supplemental&#xD;
      dose response in a large population of patients with autoimmune conditions, designed to meet&#xD;
      three specific objectives and aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Specific Aim 1: Evaluate the immunogenicity of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in patients with&#xD;
           autoimmune conditions, randomizing patients to briefly interrupt (i.e., hold for 2&#xD;
           weeks) versus continue various immunomodulatory therapies at the time that they receive&#xD;
           a supplemental (i.e., booster) mRNA vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary outcome: quantitative measurement of immunoglobulin G (IgG) against&#xD;
                SARS-CoV-2 using electrochemiluminescent (ECL) technology against the receptor&#xD;
                binding domain (RBD) of spike protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary Hypothesis (H1a): The mean titer of anti-RBD IgG antibodies specific to&#xD;
                SARS-CoV-2 measured post a third (booster) vaccine dose will be greater in patients&#xD;
                randomized to temporarily hold (e.g., 2 weeks) versus those who continue&#xD;
                immunomodulatory therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exploratory outcomes (with the randomized patients as the primary analysis&#xD;
                population, and all patients as an additional analysis population):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Measures of cell-mediated immunity and neutralizing assay or other assays to&#xD;
                     be specified in the future (E1a).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Live-viral neutralization capacity post-vaccination (E1b).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Comparison of mean titer of anti-RBD IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
                     measured post supplemental dose for each immunomodulatory therapy to be&#xD;
                     studied compared to tumor necrosis factor inhibitors.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Comparison of mean titer of anti-RBD IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
                     measured post supplemental dose compared to general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Comparison of mean titer of anti-RBD IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
                     measured post supplemental dose in patients receiving concomitant methotrexate&#xD;
                     (MTX) compared to patients not receiving concomitant MTX.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Comparison of mean titer of anti-RBD IgG antibodies specific to SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
                     spike protein measured at baseline, by immunomodulatory medication received at&#xD;
                     the time of the initial vaccine series, and according to whether the&#xD;
                     immunomodulatory medication was held or not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Specific Aim 2: Evaluate the safety and tolerability of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in&#xD;
           patients with different autoimmune conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Flare and disease worsening of underlying autoimmune/inflammatory disease&#xD;
                     within 4 weeks of the supplemental vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Vaccine reactogenicity within 1 week of the supplemental vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Other safety events (e.g., allergic reactions, anaphylaxis, potential immune&#xD;
                     mediated adverse events).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary Hypothesis #2 (H2b): the frequency of disease flare after the initial&#xD;
                vaccine series and a supplemental vaccine dose will be higher in patients who hold&#xD;
                immunomodulatory therapy compared to those who do not. Disease flare will be&#xD;
                collected retrospectively through clinical measurements and patient reported&#xD;
                outcomes for the initial vaccine series, and prospectively after receipt of the&#xD;
                supplemental vaccine dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exploratory outcomes: Comparison of circulating measures of inflammation (e.g.,&#xD;
                autoantibodies, cytokines, chemokines) between those holding and those continuing&#xD;
                immunomodulatory therapy at the time of receipt of a supplemental dose of vaccine&#xD;
                [conditional on funding availability].&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Specific Aim 3 : Determine the clinical effectiveness of SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in&#xD;
           patients with different autoimmune conditions and the subgroups of patients receiving&#xD;
           different immunomodulatory therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Exploratory outcome: clinical efficacy (i.e., clinically-recognized COVID infection&#xD;
                events) as ascertained by active surveillance, as well as passive linkage to&#xD;
                administrative health plan claims and electronic health record (EHR) data.&#xD;
