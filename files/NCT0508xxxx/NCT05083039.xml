    <textblock>
      To carry out a comparative assessment of the indices of humoral, cellular immunity and&#xD;
      cytokine profile in patients with acute respiratory infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current Program Population: 1500 healthy male and female volunteers, aged of between 18 and&#xD;
      65 will be included in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included volunteers will be divided into groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 - 750 volunteers who will be vaccinated with BiVac polio vaccine; post-vaccination&#xD;
      observation period of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2 - 750 volunteers, placebo will be administered, post-vaccination observation period&#xD;
      of 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The probability of getting into one of the two groups for each volunteer will be 50%.&#xD;

        Healthy volunteers will be invited to participate in the program. The concept of &quot;healthy&quot;&#xD;
        is defined as the absence of deviations detected during the collection of a medical&#xD;
        history, during standard clinical and instrumental examinations, as well as in the absence&#xD;
        of clinically significant deviations (from the reference values of the laboratory) in&#xD;
        laboratory blood and urine tests.&#xD;

               -  The presence of a written and dated informed consent of the volunteer to&#xD;
                  participate in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Consent to observe precautionary measures to limit the circulation of the vaccine&#xD;
                  virus among people around the vaccinated person (personal hygiene, isolation from&#xD;
                  unvaccinated children and people with immunodeficiency).&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Volunteers who are able to fulfill the requirements of the protocol (i.e., fill&#xD;
                  out a self-observation diary, remember the dates of control visit).&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  COVID-19 infection (including cases of asymptomatic carrier).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive test for COVID-19 (PCR).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaccination with any live and / or replicative vaccine one month before screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Neurological disorders that accompany previous vaccination with oral polio vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunodeficiency condition (primary).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignant neoplasms.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Immunosuppression (vaccinations are carried out no earlier than 3 months after the end&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Acute infectious or non-infectious diseases. Vaccinations are carried out 2-4 weeks&#xD;
             after recovery or remission. In case of mild acute respiratory viral infections, acute&#xD;
             intestinal diseases, vaccinations are carried out after the temperature normalizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The presence in the family or immediate environment (and provided that it is&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Non-compliance with the research procedures by the volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  • Any condition of the volunteer that requires, in the reasonable opinion of the&#xD;
