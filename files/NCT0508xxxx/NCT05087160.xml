      Objective: to assess the perinatal results in Uruguay during the semester of successful&#xD;
      control of the COVID 19 pandemic to evaluate the impact of the crises in the public and&#xD;
      private sub sectors of the Health System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology: An analytical observational study was carried out, comparing the semesters from&#xD;
      March 15 to September 30, 2019 (year prior to the COVID 19 pandemic) with the same period&#xD;
      2020 (year of the COVID 19 pandemic), in the 2 sub sectors of public and private health care.&#xD;

      An analytical observational study was carried out, comparing the semesters from March 15 to&#xD;
      September 30, 2019 with the same period 2020, in the 2 sub sectors of public health care of&#xD;
      the private sub sector throughout the country, taking all births in that period of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The semester selected is based on the fact that the first months of the pandemic were the&#xD;
      ones with the greatest mitigation measures with drastic socio-economic consequences, but it&#xD;
      was also a period of almost zero COVID infection in pregnancy, this being an opportune moment&#xD;
      not to have as confounding factor to the maternal and fetal biological complications of this&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The situation will be analyzed in the 2 sub sectors of public health care, made up of the&#xD;
      State Health Services Administration (ASSE), police health and military health, and the&#xD;
      UDELAR Clinic Hospital, on the one hand, and the private sub-sector. made up of the&#xD;
      Institutions of Collectivized Medical Assistance (IAMC) of Montevideo and the Interior&#xD;
      (FEPREMI) and the private health care insurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary variable to be analyzed in both periods and in both subsectors of the national&#xD;
      integrated system health was the incidence of preterm births (less than 37 weeks gestational&#xD;
      age), low birth weight (newborns with a birth weight less than 2,500 grams) and intrauterine&#xD;
      growth restriction (marked by doctor attending the birth, as a clinical diagnosis of the&#xD;
      current pregnancy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of the national data, of the study periods, the database was requested from&#xD;
      the Ministry of Public Health. This database is provided to researchers anonymously&#xD;
