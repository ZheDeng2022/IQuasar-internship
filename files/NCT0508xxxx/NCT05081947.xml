  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is a complex clinical syndrome characterized by the inability of the heart&#xD;
      to pump an adequate amount of blood. Heart failure affects patients' ability to carry out&#xD;
      even simple activities of daily living and therefore has a negative psychological impact.&#xD;
      Many studies reported that anxiety and depression are prevalent among HF patients and it is&#xD;
      being associated with high morbidity, mortality and costs. Community HF patients who are&#xD;
      diagnosed with depression are usually referred for Improving Access for Psychological&#xD;
      Therapies (IAPT). The IAPT services have long waiting lists and many patients in the&#xD;
      community still do not have access to IAPT. IAPT (2017) found web-based interventions for&#xD;
      psychological therapies for emotional disorders such as depression and anxiety to be as&#xD;
      effective as the traditional interventions and yielded positive mental health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this current study, the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed COMPASS web-based&#xD;
      intervention will be examined. COMPASS is a web-based therapy (online CBT program) designed&#xD;
      for the management of depression and anxiety for patients with long term conditions such as&#xD;
      heart failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted into three parts and mainly include one-to-one interviews.&#xD;
      First, the researcher will use an approach called &quot;think aloud&quot; which is a specific type of&#xD;
      interview that allows us to observe the participant while using the proposed COMPASS online&#xD;
      using Microsoft Teams. The participant will be asked to log into the COMPASS website and talk&#xD;
      to the researcher continuously as possible about what they are thinking or what comes into&#xD;
      their mind as they are using the COMPASS website. Following this interview, the researcher&#xD;
      will ask the participant to use COMPASS from any internet-connected device for four weeks&#xD;
      with weekly follow-up telephone calls. One month after the completion of COMPASS, the&#xD;
      researcher will interview the participants.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) is the inability of the heart muscle to pump enough blood to meet the&#xD;
      body's blood and oxygen requirements. The European Society of Cardiology (ESC) described HF&#xD;
      as a clinical syndrome resulting from the reduced cardiac output that may be accompanied with&#xD;
      high intracardiac pressure during rest or with stress. It is characterized by shortness of&#xD;
      breath, fatigue and limited exercise tolerance. The prevalence of HF is increasing worldwide,&#xD;
      and HF cases increased by 23% in the United Kingdom (UK) from 2002 to 2014. In the year&#xD;
      2017-2018 in England, 500,000 people were diagnosed with heart failure. According to hospital&#xD;
      diagnoses in the UK, there were up to 920,000 people living with HF. Many HF patients develop&#xD;
      anxiety and depression due to the pathological similarities in both conditions. The&#xD;
      prevalence of major in depression in HF is reported to be around 20-40% that is more than the&#xD;
      reported prevalence in the normal population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines on HF emphasized the&#xD;
      importance of treating depression in HF but there were no specific treatment options for HF&#xD;
      recommended in the document. The ESC HF recommended initiating depression treatment for all&#xD;
      HF patients using psychosocial interventions, pharmacological therapy or exercise training.&#xD;
      In Southwark and Lambeth Boroughs, the community-based HF patients who are diagnosed with&#xD;
      depression are usually referred for psychological treatment such as Improving Access for&#xD;
      Psychological Therapies (IAPT) or 3 Dimensions for Long Term Conditions (3DLC). The type of&#xD;
      treatment depends on the severity of their depression and the extent to which depression is&#xD;
      affecting clients' self-management of HF. So, for persistent and mild to moderate depression&#xD;
      or if the depression is not related to HF, the patients will be referred to IAPT for&#xD;
      treatment. While, for moderately severe to severe depression and whose depression affects&#xD;
      their management of HF, patients will be seen by the team of 3DLC. The IAPT services have&#xD;
      long waiting lists and many patients in the community with anxiety and depression still do&#xD;
      not have access to IAPT. The impact of the Covid-19 pandemic has increased the burden further&#xD;
      on IAPTS services.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study builds on our phase 2 study (268951) which is currently using online focus&#xD;
      group with community HF nurses (n=5) and qualitative telephone/online interviews with&#xD;
      community-based HF patients (n=8) to examine their views and experiences in managing&#xD;
      depression and anxiety in the primary setting, and whether the proposed COMPASS, a web-based&#xD;
      intervention, can be used for managing depression and anxiety in community-based HF patients.&#xD;
      The findings from phase 2 study will be analysed to identify patients' perspectives and&#xD;
      readiness to use the web-based COMPASS intervention for managing anxiety and depression in&#xD;
      HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study (phase 3), the feasibility and acceptability of the proposed COMPASS web-based&#xD;
      intervention will be examined with community-based HF patients. Web-based interventions such&#xD;
      as COMPASS are programs or applications that can be accessed through the website. They are&#xD;
      usually developed to change health behaviour, provide education, monitor symptoms or deliver&#xD;
      interventions. Barak et al. (2009) defined a web-based intervention as programs that are&#xD;
      primarily self-guided and that are delivered online for people requiring health and mental&#xD;
      health-related support. These interventions aim to improve knowledge or create awareness&#xD;
      through the delivery of health-related content in an interactive web-based program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IAPT (2017) found web-based interventions for psychological therapies for emotional disorders&#xD;
      such as depression and anxiety to be as effective as the traditional interventions and&#xD;
      yielded positive mental health outcomes. Web-based interventions allow the intervention to be&#xD;
      delivered through a patient-centred approach that is strengthened by the support of trained&#xD;
      therapist. With the rapid advancement in technology and the widespread use of the internet,&#xD;
      web-based interventions have grown in popularity as they are seen as cost-effective, and&#xD;
      easily accessible from a patient perspective (Murray, 2012). Web-based interventions aim to&#xD;
      improve self-management skills of patients with chronic diseases such as cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases, diabetes, and arthritis. Web-based interventions for chronic cardiac conditions&#xD;
      were reported to be cost-effective, easily accessible by participants through different&#xD;
      devices (laptops, smartphones or computers), confidential, non-stigmatizing and acceptable.&#xD;
      Patients can easily fit the web-based interventions into their daily life, and it can be&#xD;
      easily approached by HF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMPASS is a web-based intervention (online CBT program) that was developed for managing&#xD;
      illness-related anxiety and depression in patients with long-term conditions. COMPASS aims to&#xD;
      support people in managing the challenges of living with a long-term condition. COMPASS is&#xD;
      based on research that shows the benefit of combining mental and physical healthcare. COMPASS&#xD;
      was developed by a team of experienced health psychology researchers and practitioners at&#xD;
      King's College London. The structure and content of COMPASS are based on a systematic review&#xD;
      to identify mechanisms of action which trigger and sustain symptoms of depression and/or&#xD;
      anxiety in the context of LTCs. COMPASS is tailored to gain an understanding of the&#xD;
      difficulties that LTC patients experience and provide information and tools on how to manage&#xD;
      these.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COMPASS is different from other web-based talking therapy because it:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  is tailored to treat low mood and anxiety in the context of living with one or more&#xD;
           long-term conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  uses the latest research evidence to identify mechanisms known to trigger and sustain&#xD;
           symptoms of low mood and anxiety in people with long-term conditions. These mechanisms&#xD;
           are then targeted in the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  has been co-developed by people with long-term conditions to improve its acceptability,&#xD;
           utility and ease of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed COMPASS program consists of 11 online sessions for patients to work through over&#xD;
      approximately 12 weeks. The sessions can be worked through in any order the patient would&#xD;
      like. The sessions are split into four quadrants - North, East, South and West - which&#xD;
      explore different elements of managing the LTC challenges that were identified from the&#xD;
      evidence-based systematic review. Sessions contain information, interactive tasks, goal&#xD;
      setting and patient stories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the proposed COMPASS is found to be applicable to use in HF, this will help patients who&#xD;
      are considered vulnerable and are shielding from, for example, the COVID-19 outbreak. During&#xD;
      the pandemic, patients were unable to attend for psychological therapies that were conducted&#xD;
      face to face, thus the use of COMPASS will assist in delivering the psychological&#xD;
      intervention for a large number of patients anywhere and at any time. In this study, the&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility of COMPASS as a web-based intervention during the Covid-19&#xD;
      pandemic will be also explored as a virtual therapeutic intervention.&#xD;
