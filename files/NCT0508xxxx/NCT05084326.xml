  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In primigravida, Delayed engagement of fetal head has been theorized that it is more likely&#xD;
      in women with a possible cephalo-pelvic disproportion, so far they are associated with higher&#xD;
      risk of cervical dystocia, which led to increased rate of caesarean section.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve total 226 of &quot; 113 primigravida patients with engaged head and 113&#xD;
      primigravida patients with unengaged head .&#xD;
&#xD;
      while assessment of fetal head station, status of membrane should be evaluated and noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Engagement will be assessed by vaginal examination as described by MÃ¼ller in 1868 , assumes&#xD;
      that when the leading edge of the vertex is felt at the level of the ischial spines, the&#xD;
      biparietal diameter will have just passed through the pelvic brim. The leading edge of the&#xD;
      vertex at the level of the ischial spines is designated as being at station 0. If the leading&#xD;
      edge is 1 cm below the level of the spines, this is referred to as station +1. Usually, a&#xD;
      head on the pelvic floor is at station +4 or +5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uengaged head is still 2 cm above the level of the spines is at station -2, and so on.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study will be to determine if primigravida patients with unengaged head after&#xD;
      spontaneous onset of labor are at increased risk of cesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be admitted in the labour room. Name, age and detailed history will be&#xD;
      noted A thorough general examination and systemic examination will be done to determine the&#xD;
      fundal height, the baby's lie, presentation, position, engagement of the presenting part, and&#xD;
      frequency and duration of contractions, auscultation of the fetal heart rate for a minimum of&#xD;
      1 minute immediately after a contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A vaginal examination will be offered for more assessment of pelvic status, cervical dilation&#xD;
      (in cm) and effacement, position of fetal head and status of membrane will be evaluated and&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of labor progress will be done by digital examination : to document cervical&#xD;
      dilation, effacement, and fetal station are usually routinely performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At four hour intervals in the first stage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prior to administering analgesia/anesthesia*&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  When the parturient feels the urge to push (to determine whether the cervix is fully&#xD;
           dilated)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At one hour intervals in the second stage&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If fetal heart rate abnormalities occur &quot; to evaluate for complications such as cord&#xD;
           prolapse &quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  All patients should be counselled and offered Epidural anesthesia during first and&#xD;
                second stage of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations during the established frst stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Half-hourly documentation of frequency of contractions&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hourly pulse&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 4-hourly temperature and blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A vaginal examination 4-hourly or if there is concern about progress&#xD;
&#xD;
      If delay is established in first stage of labour of cervical dilatation of less than 2 cm in&#xD;
      4 hours for frst labour , amniotomy should be considered for all women with intact membranes&#xD;
      increase the strength and pain of contractions, in normally progressing labour, do not&#xD;
      perform amniotomy routinely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vaginal examination 2 hours later, and diagnose delay if progress is less than 1 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      increase the strength and pain of contractions, vaginal examination 2 hours later, and&#xD;
      diagnose delay if progress is less than 1 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision about management options of oxytocin augmentation according NICE guidelines should&#xD;
      considered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to RCOG guidelines, we will use a low-dose protocol for all patients, by adding 10&#xD;
      IU oxytocin to 1 litre of 0.9% normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Electronic fetal monitoring will be performed for a minimum of 20 minutes before starting&#xD;
      oxytocin, and will be continued until the baby is delivered, intervention will be according&#xD;
      to interpretation of CTG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to NICE guidelines, vaginal examination 4 hours after starting oxytocin in&#xD;
      established labour:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If cervical dilatation has increased by less than 2 cm after 4 hours of oxytocin,&#xD;
           further obstetric review is required to assess the need for caesarean section.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If cervical dilatation has increased by 2 cm or more, advise 4-hourly vaginal&#xD;
           examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observations during the second stage:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Half-hourly documentation of the frequency of contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Hourly blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Continued 4-hourly temperature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Frequency of passing urine .&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. A vaginal examination hourly in the active second stage.&#xD;
