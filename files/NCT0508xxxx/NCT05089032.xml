      The practice of providing palliative care in the situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in the&#xD;
      perspective of physicians and nurses - survey study (PEOpLe-C19 study)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pandemic of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus 2) causing&#xD;
      the disease COVID-19 (Coronavirus Disease 2019) overwhelmed healthcare and brought new&#xD;
      challenges and stressful situations. In a short time, intensive care units (ICU) capacities&#xD;
      were filled in many countries and regions. Due to the need for an excessive number of&#xD;
      patients requiring intensive care, physicians and nurses who do not routinely provide care to&#xD;
      critically ill patients or do not have the appropriate training (non-ICU clinician) were&#xD;
      involved in the care of COVID-19 patients. In this context, ICU directly dedicated to caring&#xD;
      for patients with COVID-19 ARDS (Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome) was also opened.&#xD;
      Non-ICU clinicians were more or less involved together with the standard ICU staff in&#xD;
      palliative care, including End-of-Life decision (EOLD) making, even in a situation of&#xD;
      limited, scarce resources (equipment or personnel). New workplace and scope of work, which&#xD;
      did not correspond to the standard activity or education, most likely led to an increased&#xD;
      stress load. EOLD can also be one of the factors leading to increased stress levels. The&#xD;
      project aims to describe the practice of palliative care for patients with COVID-19 in a&#xD;
      situation of pandemic COVID-19 and to identify factors leading to possible moral distress&#xD;
      related to EOLD.&#xD;
