    <textblock>
      No standard approach currently exists for endoscopic esophageal stent placement, and both&#xD;
      sutured and un-sutured techniques are employed for esophageal stent placement currently. The&#xD;
      primary purpose of this study is to find out if suture fixation of esophageal stents is&#xD;
      superior to non-suture fixated stent placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consecutive patients who are scheduled for esophageal stent placement will be identified as&#xD;
      potential study participants by study personnel and will be approached on the day of the&#xD;
      procedure. Informed consent will be obtained and patients will be randomized into suture&#xD;
      fixation and non-suture fixation groups. Patients in the suture fixation group will have&#xD;
      their esophageal stent secured in location with two endoscopic sutures. Those in the&#xD;
      non-suture fixation group will have no sutures placed. Main study outcome is stent migration,&#xD;
      and rates of stent migration will be compared in the two groups.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Esophageal stents are commonly placed for both benign and malignant etiologies. Uncovered or&#xD;
      partially covered metal stents are employed for malignant conditions while fully covered&#xD;
      self-expanding metal stents (FC-SEMSs) are generally placed for the management of benign&#xD;
      conditions. FC-SEMSs are also commonly used for managing perforations, fistulae as well as&#xD;
      for palliation of symptoms that result from benign structuring disease. Due to the difficulty&#xD;
      of uncovered stent removal, FC-SEMSs and partially covered self-expanding metal stents&#xD;
      (PC-SEMS) are increasingly utilized for patients with malignancy undergoing neo-adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Stent migration remains the most frequently encountered complication and the&#xD;
      main drawback to their use. While some tissue in-growth is expected in the uncovered metal&#xD;
      stents with resulting stability, the silicone coating in covered SEMSs, and to some degree in&#xD;
      partially covered stents prevents ingrowth, resulting in higher rates of stent migration;&#xD;
      rates exceeding 40% are reported in current scientific literature.2 In recent years, suture&#xD;
      fixation of stents has been explored for migration mitigation however data is limited to&#xD;
      retrospective series and real-world practice varies depending on endoscopist expertise and&#xD;
      experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing System (Apollo Endosurgery Incorporation, Austin, TX) is&#xD;
      an FDA approved endoscopic suturing system initially designed for closure of gut wall during&#xD;
      NOTES procedures,3 however it is now commonly employed for closing perforations, leaks, and&#xD;
      has recently garnered attention for stent fixation by suturing in place. At West Virginia&#xD;
      University, this device is used, depending on endoscopist preference, to suture esophageal&#xD;
      stents to prevent migration. The Investigators aim to perform a randomized clinical trial of&#xD;
      endoscopic suture fixated and un-sutured stent placement and compare stent migration rates,&#xD;
      technical success, clinical success, and adverse events along with healthcare cost&#xD;
      utilization in the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial will be performed at WVU Ruby Memorial Hospital. Patients who&#xD;
      are scheduled for esophageal stent placement will be identified as potential study&#xD;
      participants by study personnel and will be approached by study personnel on the day of the&#xD;
      procedure. Eligibility will be confirmed, and study procedures will be explained. After&#xD;
      informed consent is obtained, the patient will be randomized to one of the two groups and the&#xD;
      endoscopy will be informed. Each group will consist of 30 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Esophageal stent will be placed in the standard of care fashion by the endoscopists using&#xD;
      standard Olympus gastroscopes. 18 to 23 mm covered self-expanding metal stent will be placed&#xD;
      as per endoscopist preference. After esophageal stent placement, endoscopic suturing will be&#xD;
      performed in cases of patients randomized to suture fixation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suture securement of the esophageal stents will be performed using commercially available&#xD;
      devices. All endoscopes, and suturing devices will be used in accordance with appropriate&#xD;
      Directions for Use (DFU) provided by the manufacturer. The OverStitch Endoscopic Suturing&#xD;
      System (Apollo Endosurgery Incorporation, Austin, TX) is an FDA approved endoscopic suturing&#xD;
      system that will be utilized in the suture fixation cohort. Standard scope reprocessing will&#xD;
      be performed as per institutional protocol after use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline chest radiographs will be obtained within one week of stent placement. Repeat&#xD;
      radiographs to assess the esophageal stents will be obtained at 4-12 weeks after stent&#xD;
      placement or in the event of worsening or new symptoms. Chest Xrays will be assessed by&#xD;
      attending consultant radiologist and stent positioning will be determined by comparison to&#xD;
      local anatomic skeletal landmarks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be contacted by the study team by telephone 30 days after procedure to&#xD;
      assess for any ongoing symptoms or adverse events. Information on unplanned visits including&#xD;
      unplanned emergency department visits or inpatient admissions will also be collected.&#xD;
      Electronic health records of patients will be reviewed at 30 days after procedure for&#xD;
      obtaining information on unplanned ED visits, or inpatient visits.&#xD;
