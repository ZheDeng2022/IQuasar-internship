      A. Purpose / Rationale The success of the United States vaccination program against&#xD;
      SARS-Cov-2 is shown by the dramatic drop in infection rates, hospitalizations and&#xD;
      deaths1.However, it appears that many persons who take medications that chronically suppress&#xD;
      the immune system do not produce neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19 proteins in response to&#xD;
      vaccination2, 3,4. This group includes a significant number of persons with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (PWMS), many of whom are on therapies that chronically suppress their immune&#xD;
      function. It is not clear what advice clinicians should provide regarding COVID-19&#xD;
      precautions to patients who fail to develop detectable COVID-19 spike protein antibodies&#xD;
      using standard commercially-available tests after a standard series of vaccination, or&#xD;
      whether they should test for antibody responses to COVID-19 vaccines in the absence of&#xD;
      guidelines. A key research question is whether, in the absence of stopping or reducing&#xD;
      potentially immune-altering therapies, there is away to increase the likelihood of a&#xD;
      neutralizing antibody response to COVID-19 vaccination in PWMS who are taking immune&#xD;
      suppressive medications.&#xD;

      Goals The goal of this study is to test whether adding booster doses of COVID-19 vaccine to&#xD;
      PWMS can improve the immune response to COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare pre and post anti-COVID-19 immunity after a booster vaccinationin PWMS who&#xD;
           initially test negative for neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19 after initial&#xD;
           vaccination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine how disease modifying treatments, baseline antibody panels and lymphocyte&#xD;
           subsets associate with the efficacy of booster vaccines;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare immune responses between homologous vs. heterologous booster vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Implications and Future Directions It is hoped that the results of this study will&#xD;
      help guide clinicalrecommendations on the use of booster vaccination and whether to endorse&#xD;
      heterologous versus homologous boosters. It is also hoped that this study will add to the&#xD;
      growing body of data on COVID-19 immunity after vaccination in PWMS on various disease&#xD;
      modifying treatments (DMTs).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the present time, there is no basis for making these recommendations in the absence of&#xD;
      data. While there are EUAs in place for COVID-19 tests, the results of these tests can be&#xD;
      problematic for patients and clinicians. Should patients who test negative for COVID-19 spike&#xD;
      protein antibodies consider themselves immune to COVID-19or should they labor under the&#xD;
      recommended precautions for unvaccinated individuals?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Booster doses of COVID-19 vaccines will improve antibody-based immunity to COVID-19in&#xD;
           PWMS who initially test negative for neutralizing antibodies to COVID-19 after initial&#xD;
           vaccination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This boost in immunity will occur irrespective of disease modifying therapy (DMT);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heterologous prime-boost combinations will show greater immune responses than homologous&#xD;
           prime-boost combinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background Multiple Sclerosis Pathophysiology and Treatment Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an&#xD;
      autoimmune condition associated with focal inflammatory infiltrates in the brain consisting&#xD;
      of T and B lymphocytes, macrophages and activated microglial cells, with the principal target&#xD;
      being the myelin sheath of CNS axons. The approach to treating MS involves disease-modifying&#xD;
      therapies (DMT) that have the effect of reducing access of potentially myelin-autoreactive&#xD;
      immune cells to the central nervous system compartment. These treatments are shown to reduce&#xD;
      exacerbations of disease and, to some degree, delay progression of neurological disability,&#xD;
      both by clinical assessment, and, by the best surrogate marker to date, magnetic resonance&#xD;
      imaging of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DMTs used to treat multiple sclerosis target adaptive immune responses in various ways. These&#xD;
      include medications that shift cytokine and lymphocyte subsets towards less inflammatory&#xD;
      activity, interfere with trafficking of lymphocytes in the circulation or central nervous&#xD;
      system, or otherwise inhibit lymphocytes through nonspecific or subset depletion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are a number of approved and off-label treatments for MS. They include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. anti-CD20 (CD20 is a B lymphocyte receptor) monoclonal antibodies (ocrelizumab,&#xD;
           rituximab and ofatunumab);&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. lymphocyte-sequestering drugs (fingolimod, onzanimod, siponomod);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. adhesion molecule antibodies that prevent CNS lymphocyte trafficking(natalizumab);&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. nuclear erythroid 2-related factor two (Nrf2) modulators (dimethyl fumarate, diroxmel&#xD;
           fumarate);&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. nonselective lymphocyte-depleters (cyclophosphamide, cladribine, alemtuzumab);&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. replication blocking lymphostatic drugs (teriflunomide) and immune modulators&#xD;
           (interferon, glatiramer acetate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these mechanisms could, theoretically, influence immune responses to vaccination.Live&#xD;
      or live attenuated vaccines are contraindicated with several DMTs due to the risk of immune&#xD;
      suppression. For COVID-19 immunity, both B and T lymphocyte activation is important. DMTs&#xD;
      that are more immune-suppressive have shown attenuated responses to influenza vaccines and,&#xD;
      presumably, would show the same for COVID-19 vaccines. These include the&#xD;
      lymphocyte-sequestering drugs (e.g., fingolimod, onzanimod and siponimod), the antiCd20+&#xD;
      depleting drugs (e.g.,ocrelizumab, ofatunumab and rituximab), and the general immune&#xD;
      suppressants (e.g., alemtuzumab or cladribine). DMTs that have not been shown to inhibit&#xD;
      immune responses to influenza vaccines include the interferons, glatiramer acetate, dimethyl&#xD;
      fumarates, diroximel, and teriflunomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccines The most deadly threat to global health in more than 100 years, SARS-CoV-2,&#xD;
      has infected more than 174 million persons to date, with a death toll approaching 4 million.&#xD;
      However, the speed of development and deployment of vaccines in the United States and other,&#xD;
      mostly affluent countries, has drastically reduced the incidence, morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      from COVID-19 infection. In the U.S. to date more than 60% of the population have received at&#xD;
      least one vaccination, and current projections estimate 70% by July 4th.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently three COVID-19 vaccines in the U.S.have been approved by the Federal Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration for Emergency Authorization Use (EAU). BNT162b2, manufactured by Pfizer, Inc.&#xD;
      and BioNTech, Inc.and mRNA-1273, manufactured by Moderna, Inc., are RNA-based vaccines. They&#xD;
      consist of modified COVID-19 mRNA sequences for the receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the&#xD;
      M-spike protein. The mRNAs enter host cells via a lipid nanoparticle delivery system, where&#xD;
      they are transcribed by host cell enzymes to produce a stabilized prefusion SARS-CoV-2 spike&#xD;
      protein (S-2P), which localizes to the cell surface and presented as antigen for the host&#xD;
      immune system. Ad26.COV2.S, manufactured by Johnson&amp;Johnson/Janssen,is a dsDNA vaccine&#xD;
      thatemploys a similar strategy, the difference being that it enters the host cell nucleus via&#xD;
      a non-replicating adenovirus vector, where it is transcribed to make spike protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large clinical studies show that the RNA vaccines, BNT162b2 and mRNA-1273, are 95% and 94.1%&#xD;
      effective respectively against COVID-19 infection, while the DNA vaccine,Ad26.COV2.S, was&#xD;
      66.9% effective overall against COVID-19 infection and 76.7% effective against&#xD;
      severe-critical COVID-19 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection and Multiple Sclerosis. In some literature reviews and studies, PWMS,&#xD;
      including those on a wide spectrum of DMTs, do not seem to be at greater risk per se of&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality from COVID-19 infection. A review of 873 published cases of&#xD;
      COVID-19 multiple sclerosis patients, found that the overall mortality rate was 4% and that&#xD;
      an additional 3% required some form of ventilation. Furthermore, immune suppressive&#xD;
      treatments did not appear to be a risk factor for severe disease. An unfavorable prognosis&#xD;
      for 28 PWMS who contracted COVID-19 in a Spanish study was related to older age and greater&#xD;
      disability. These and other observations have prompted some to speculate that relative immune&#xD;
      suppression may actually protect PWMS against inflammatory storm that accompanies severe&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection. On the other hand, a meta-analysis of 84 reports of PWMS with COVID-19&#xD;
      infection and their DMT treatments, while not finding a relationship between the type of DMT&#xD;
      and COVID-19 course, did find that the highest mortality rate, e.g., 4% out of a 1.8% overall&#xD;
      mortality rate of those infected, was in persons treated with rituximab, a monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody that suppresses B lymphocytes and antibody production. This higher incidence of&#xD;
      severe COVID-19 infection in MS patients on rituximab was confirmed by another retrospective&#xD;
      study. A similar monoclonal antibody, ocrelizumab, was found to be associated with suppressed&#xD;
      COVID-19 specific antibodies compared to other DMTs among 59 PWMS who had&#xD;
      laboratory-confirmed COVID-19 infection. However, COVID-19 specific T lymphocyte assays were&#xD;
      not different between ocrelizumab and other DMTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID vaccination and MS While there is a paucity of data relating multiple sclerosis, DMTs&#xD;
      and acquired immunity to COVID-19 infection, there is evidence that the use of some DMTs in&#xD;
      MS can attenuate the immune response to various viral and nonviral vaccines. A number of DMTs&#xD;
      in common use in MS patients increase their risk for a number of infectious complications,&#xD;
      including bacterial and nonbacterial upper and lower respiratory tract infections, herpes&#xD;
      virus infections, cryptococcal meningitis, progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy and&#xD;
      reactivation of latent tuberculosis and hepatitis B infections. Therefore, clinicians must be&#xD;
      mindful of the initiation and timing of vaccinations, as well as the selection of DMTs in&#xD;
      particular patients, to mitigate the risk of opportunistic infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is critical with respect to assessing the protective effect of COVID-19 vaccination&#xD;
      during the pandemic, especially as public health measures against COVID-19, e.g., social&#xD;
      distancing, mask wearing, work and school restrictions, have been relaxed for vaccinated&#xD;
      persons. What is clear from some preliminary studies is that PWMS on particular DMTs have&#xD;
      attenuated responses to COVID-19 vaccines. Furthermore, there are approximately a dozen&#xD;
      ongoing studies assessing the impact of DMTs on COVID-19 vaccination.One such study looked at&#xD;
      antibody levels to the COVID-19 spike protein after vaccination with BNT162b2 in patients on&#xD;
      no treatment or high efficacy DMTs, e.g.,fingolimod, cladribine, or ocrelizumab. Humoral&#xD;
      immunity in patients on ocreluzumab was achieved in 22.7%; fingolimod 3.8%, and cladribine&#xD;
      100% 33.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential attenuation of immunity to COVID-19 vaccination in PWMS at present is an&#xD;
      unresolved dilemma for patients and physicians. Of course, this applies to other patients as&#xD;
      well, including those on immune suppressive treatments for cancer or rheumatological&#xD;
      diseases. There are commercially available assays to measure COVID-19 spike protein&#xD;
      antibodies, but what are physicians to tell patients who test negative for these antibodies&#xD;
      after vaccination. Some MS colleagues take the position that the tests should not be ordered&#xD;
      because we have no guidance as to how to use that information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Booster Vaccination One possible way to mitigate this dilemma is to administer booster&#xD;
      vaccinations.A number of clinical investigators in other medical specialties are testing this&#xD;
      approach. Indeed, since we do not know the extent to which the current vaccines induce&#xD;
      long-term immunity to COVID-19, this is a relevant issue for the general population as well.&#xD;
      A small study of 33 adults showed that high levels of antibodies persisted for six months&#xD;
      after vaccination with mRNA-1273.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A booster vaccine may be homologous (same vaccine) or heterologous (different vaccine)&#xD;
      relative to the initial vaccine.Evidence from one mouse study indicates that the immune&#xD;
      response is more robust from heterologous combinations of mRNA and DNA COVID-19 vaccines than&#xD;
      homologous combinations, particularly in the induction of T cells, which is believed to be&#xD;
      more important for long term immunity. Another rationale for the use of heterologous&#xD;
      combinations is to administer one dose each of the combination, rather than a full series of&#xD;
      the mRNA vaccine, to determine which strategy produces more robust immunity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two large studies are underway. One involves more than 600 persons enrolled in a Spanish&#xD;
      study who had received the Oxford-AstraZenica vaccine (DNA vaccine), which was then followed&#xD;
      by BNT162b2 eight weeks later. Compared to the control group who did not receive a second&#xD;
      vaccine dose, the levels of antibodies in the treated group were 150 times greater and side&#xD;
      effects reported were similar to the homologous regimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second study is a more than 800 person study from the UK in which four combinations of the&#xD;
      ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 (AstraZenica) and BNT162b2 will be tested in four cohorts with immune&#xD;
      responses measured at 28 and 84 day intervals. Preliminary analyses showed that systemic side&#xD;
      effects were more common in the heterologous group, including chills, fatigue, headache,&#xD;
      joint pain, malaise, and muscle ache, but all were short-lived and not associated with&#xD;
      concerning hematological or metabolic abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study will attempt to address whether giving a heterologous dose of a booster vaccine&#xD;
      will increase the chance of both antibody production and T lymphocyte activation in PWMS who&#xD;
      do not initially show evidence of antibody reactivity.&#xD;
