  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is widely accepted that thoracotomy causes severe acute pain. This increases the frequency&#xD;
      of postoperative pulmonary complications and postoperative morbidity. Many analgesic methods&#xD;
      have been proposed for thoracotomy pain, including thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA),&#xD;
      thoracic paravertebral block (TPVB), intercostal nerve blocks (ICSB), erector spinae plane&#xD;
      block (ESPB), serratus anterior plane block (SAPB). Among these methods, ultrasound-guided&#xD;
      TPVB and ESPB are the most used methods. TPVB has left its place to newer techniques such as&#xD;
      ESPB due to its proximity to the pleura and its deeper location. ESPB is more superficial,&#xD;
      easy to access, and less likely to have complications. In addition, ESPB application is&#xD;
      increasing in patients who underwent thoracotomy and VATS. There is no consensus on the dose&#xD;
      of analgesia in these studies. There are studies on volumes between 10 ml and 40 ml in the&#xD;
      literature. In this study, it was aimed to compare the volumes of 20 ml and 30 ml containing&#xD;
      local anesthetic at the same concentration (0.25% bupivacaine) of ESPB block to be performed&#xD;
      with USG in patients who underwent thoracotomy.&#xD;
