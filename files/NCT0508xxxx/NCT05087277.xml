    <textblock>
      The level of neutralizing antibody was detected by using the constructed pseudovirus covid-19&#xD;
      variant at baseline , 1 month , 6 months and 12 months after primary vaccination, within 15&#xD;
      days after booster immunization at 12 months . and the ability of IgG subclasses to&#xD;
      neutralize and cross immunization of variant strains was analyzed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In 150 individuals who received primary and booster COVID-19 inactivated vaccine, the&#xD;
      neutralization ability of antibodies against covid-19 mutant after primary and booster&#xD;
      immunization was evaluated by constructing pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 variants. The contribution&#xD;
      and influence of IgG subclasses on neutralization capacity were assessed by Elisa assay. All&#xD;
      participants were recruited aged between 18 and 59 years old. Every participant was&#xD;
      familiarized with the aim of the study and asked to sign an informed consent agreement and&#xD;
      was required blood sampling at the day 0 of first dose vaccine and 1 month, 6 months after&#xD;
      2nd dose of primary immunization. All participants had received 1 dose of booster&#xD;
      immunization at 12 months after fully primary vaccination. Then 150 people were divided into&#xD;
      four groups, Blood samples were taken on days 0,3,7,10 and 14 to detect neutralizing&#xD;
      antibodies and IgG subclasses separately. every sample was detected SARS-CoV-2 variants&#xD;
      strain Alpha, Beta and Delta neutralizing antibody, and RBD-IgG1, IgG2, IgG3, and IgG4. every&#xD;
      individual was conducted a detailed analysis correlation of isotype switching, neutralizing&#xD;
      antibody titer and cross immunity against COVID-19 variants after primary and booster&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
