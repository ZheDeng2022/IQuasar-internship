  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will assess the effect of multiple doses of itraconazole, a strong CYP3A4/5&#xD;
      inhibitor, on the PK of ganaplacide and lumefantrine in healthy participants. This study will&#xD;
      provide data that is relevant for advice regarding possible concomitant medications that are&#xD;
      inhibitors of CYP3A4/5 in future clinical studies with ganaplacide and lumefantrine and for&#xD;
      potential future labeling considerations&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, fixed sequence, 2-period, crossover, drug-drug interaction (DDI)&#xD;
      study, to evaluate the effect of multiple doses of itraconazole on the single dose PK of&#xD;
      ganaplacide and lumefantrine in healthy participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist of a screening period of up to 28 days, 2 Baseline evaluations (on Day&#xD;
      -1 of each treatment period), and 2 treatment periods which are separated by a washout&#xD;
      period. Participants who meet the eligibility criteria at Screening will be admitted to the&#xD;
      study site for First Baseline evaluations on Day -1 of Period 1. Baseline safety assessments&#xD;
      will be performed prior to first dosing of study treatment in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants enrolled will receive a single oral dose of ganaplacide and lumefantrine&#xD;
      combination on Day 1 of Period 1. In Period 2, participants will receive itraconazole once&#xD;
      daily (q.d.) on Days 1 to 18 and a single dose of ganaplacide and lumefantrine combination on&#xD;
      Day 5, approximately 2 hours after the itraconazole dose. There will be 336 hours of&#xD;
      sequential blood sampling for PK assessment starting after ganaplacide and lumefantrine&#xD;
      dosing in each treatment period. Between the 2 treatment periods, there will be an additional&#xD;
      washout period of at least 14 days, beginning from the last PK sample collection in Period 1&#xD;
      and continuing until the first dose of study treatment in Period 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each dose of ganaplacide and lumefantrine combination will be administered after at least 10&#xD;
      hours of overnight fasting and will be followed by at least 4 hours of fasting post dose. In&#xD;
      Period 2, itraconazole will be administered after at least 10 hours of overnight fasting and&#xD;
      followed by at least 1 hour of fasting post dose (except on Day 5 when ganaplacide and&#xD;
      lumefantrine will be administered approximately 2 hours after itraconazole dosing and&#xD;
      participants will continue fasting for at least 4 hours post ganaplacide and lumefantrine&#xD;
      dosing).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety assessments (including physical examinations, electrocardiograms (ECGs), vital signs,&#xD;
      clinical laboratory evaluations [hematology, chemistry, coagulation, and urinalysis], and&#xD;
      adverse event [AE] and serious adverse event [SAE] monitoring) will be performed during the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Study Completion evaluations will occur on Day 19 of Period 2, followed by a post study&#xD;
      safety contact (e.g. follow-up telephone call, email) approximately 30 days after the last&#xD;
      dose of study treatment. In the case of early termination, Study Completion evaluations will&#xD;
      be conducted prior to discharge from the study.&#xD;
