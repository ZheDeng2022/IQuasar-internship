    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled study which aims to improve the quality of life of Crohn's disease&#xD;
      adult patients suffering from mild to moderate level of symptoms. Patients will be randomized&#xD;
      to Intervention or Wait-List groups and will undergo eight Cognitive Behavioral and&#xD;
      Mindfulness, one on one, sessions with a social worker via SkypeTM. The Intervention group&#xD;
      will receive intervention upon recruitment while the Wait-List group will receive the same&#xD;
      intervention after 3 months. Clinical, biological and psycho-social data will be collected at&#xD;
      four time points over the 12-months of the study.&#xD;

      1. Overall objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Primary outcome: To determine whether mindfulness-based stress reduction will lead&#xD;
                to a better health-related quality-of-life by use of three questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
                â€¢ the Crohn's disease specific SIBDQ (Short Inflammatory Bowel Disease&#xD;
                Questionnaire, with mean score and 4 subscales: bowel, systemic, social, emotional)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  SF-12 (MOS Short-Form-12) which is derived from the generic SF-36 used in our&#xD;
                     previous research (SF-36 measures a Physical Health Summary Score comprised of&#xD;
                     physical functioning, role-physical, bodily pain and general health, and a&#xD;
                     Mental Health Summary Score comprised of vitality, role-emotional, social&#xD;
                     functioning and mental health).&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  EQ-5D (EuroQol questionnaire, for calculation of utility weights)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Secondary outcomes: improvement in mindfulness (FMI, Freiburg Mindfulness&#xD;
                Inventory); reduction of stress, anxiety and depression (BSI - Brief Symptom&#xD;
                Inventory, GSI - General Severity Index stress measure, MSPSS- Multidimensional&#xD;
                Scale of Perceived Social Support, PSS-4 Perceived Stress Scale, LEQ- life events&#xD;
                questionnaire); better satisfaction with life (SWLS, Satisfaction with Life Scale);&#xD;
                improved family function (FAD, Family Assessment Device); pain reduction (HBI,&#xD;
                Harvey-Bradshaw Index of activity of Crohn's disease); less fatigue (FACIT Fatigue&#xD;
                Scale); better coping with disease (COPE: Brief Cope Inventory - Brief Coping&#xD;
                Operations Preference Enquiry); better performance at work (WPAI, Work Productivity&#xD;
                and Activity Impairment) and cost estimation. Significant changes in the scores of&#xD;
                these questionnaires, based on our current work comparing P-HBI remission versus&#xD;
                active disease, are the following (all are given in points, except WPAI is&#xD;
                percent): SIBDQ 6, SWLS 5, FAD 0.15, COPE dysfunctional 2.5, COPE emotion-focused&#xD;
                0.7, COPE problem-focused 0.6, WPAI time missed 14, WPAI percent impairment 29,&#xD;
                WPAI work impairment 28, WPAI activity impairment 30, GSI 0.6, BSI anxiety 0.6, BSI&#xD;
                depression 0.6. We did not use the SF-12, EQ-5D, MSPSS, PSS-4 and the FACIT Fatigue&#xD;
                Scale in our previous research and will look at reports in the literature and our&#xD;
                newly acquired data to determine what are significant improvements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Before and at the end of each intervention session a short assessment of patient's&#xD;
                subjective units of distress (SUDS) will be done, as per Wolpe, Joseph (1969), The&#xD;
                Practice of Behavior Therapy, New York: Pergamon Press, and the 4 question&#xD;
                Short-Form Perceived Stress Scale, as per Warttig et al, J Health Psychology&#xD;
                2013;18:1617-28.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Correlations of psychological measures with demography, economic status, HBI,&#xD;
                immune regulation, telomere shortening, fMRI data, changes in composition of&#xD;
                microbiota. Change in biophysical parameters as sleep physical activity &amp; pulse&#xD;
                rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. To determine whether the intervention is cost-saving or cost-effective, by&#xD;
                prospective monitoring of resource use and indirect costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. To determine whether the intervention can be given effectively using telemedicine&#xD;
                with Skype or alternative software.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. To study patient acceptability of the intervention, including recruitment and&#xD;
                drop-out rate, and the adherence rate to home practice of the stress reduction&#xD;
                measure taught.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Expected outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Reduced HBI, improvement of all the psychological measures including both&#xD;
                quality-of-life and satisfaction with life, less stress, less fatigue, more use of&#xD;
                adaptive coping strategies, with no clear improvements in the control group.&#xD;
                Improvement in biophysical parameters as sleep physical activity &amp; pulse rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. The research will identify the best form of delivering the interventional therapy&#xD;
                and if it is cost-saving or cost-effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Confirmation of the reliability of measurements of modification of immune&#xD;
                regulation mechanisms and telomere length, grey matter thickness and composition of&#xD;
                the microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Glucocorticoid resistance and related laboratory determinations on patients'&#xD;
                leukocytes will add to understanding the biological mechanisms associated with&#xD;
                stress-induced pathogenic autoimmunity in the patients in a sex-dependent manner.&#xD;
                This will add to our understanding the biological mechanisms associated with stress&#xD;
                in Crohn's disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Work plan and methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Patient recruitment i. Patients: 200 patients being treated at all the participating&#xD;
           hospitals (Soroka Medical Center, Rambam Health Campus, Sheba Medical Center, Rabin&#xD;
           Medical Center, Shaare Zedek Medical Center), which all have electronic records of large&#xD;
           cohorts of patients with Crohn's disease and by advertising through patient support&#xD;
           groups and institutions upon approval. The recruitment of patients will be offered in&#xD;
           all the hospitals. Preference will be given to patients who have participated in the&#xD;
           previous IIRN study and are now participating in the new IIRN studies proposed by the&#xD;
           other hospitals, and those patients in higher risk groups (poorer men, female gender,&#xD;
           etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      iv. Patients on a fixed dose of corticosteroids and those who received corticosteroid therapy&#xD;
      in last 6 months will present a special sub-group on whom the laboratory studies of cortisol&#xD;
      and glucocorticoid resistance may differ significantly from patients not on this treatment,&#xD;
      but this will have to be verified by measurements in a small sample to determine the&#xD;
      magnitude of the effect before a decision to include or exclude these individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      v. Patients with change of diagnosis in the course of the study period will be excluded from&#xD;
      the final analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      vi. Ethical considerations: This protocol will need approval of the Ethics Committee at all&#xD;
      hospitals prior to commencement of patient recruitment and access of patient data at these&#xD;
      hospitals. A signed informed consent form will be obtained from each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      b. Assessment of patient status i. Medical status (HBI) and phenotype. No attempt will be&#xD;
      made to modify the patients' treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ii. Psycho-social self-report questionnaires: demography, economic status, SIBDQ, EQ-5D,&#xD;
      SF-12, WPAI, SWLS, FACIT, COPE, FAD, BSI, GSI, FMI, MSPSS, PSS-4, LEQ.&#xD;
&#xD;
      iii. Objective outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HBI, CRP, calprotectin, relevant imaging studies (radiology, endoscopy) biophysical&#xD;
           parameters as sleep physical activity &amp; pulse rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Special tests on all or selected sub-sets of patients: immune regulation, telomeres,&#xD;
           fMRI, and microbiota.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Biophysical parameters as sleep physical activity &amp; pulse rate will be monitored in 30&#xD;
           patients by using commercially available smart watches.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Psycho-social interventions i. The sample size calculation is based on Î± = 0.05,&#xD;
           power = 0.8, SD = 14 (data from our current research) in order to achieve a 6-point&#xD;
           change in the SIBDQ (the primary endpoint). Thus, the cohort will consist of 172&#xD;
           patients computer-randomized to two groups; 86 patients with mindfulness-based stress&#xD;
           reduction, and 86 wait-list controls that will enter the intervention phase after 3&#xD;
           months. In order to allow for a 15% expected drop-out rate, these recruitment numbers&#xD;
           may need to be increased to 200 patients. An equal number of women and men will be&#xD;
           recruited at each hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. The group that receives mindfulness-based stress reduction at their entry into the&#xD;
           study will have 7 sequential sessions during 3 months, and later have a booster session&#xD;
           in month 5. This group will have 4 time points for assessment (see Table, below).&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii. Wait-list control patients will get no intervention at the start of the study and&#xD;
           instead will be contacted by study personal 7 times to care for the patient in order to&#xD;
           control for the 7 sessions performed in the intervention group. After three months they&#xD;
           will be offered mindfulness-based stress reduction as 8 sequential sessions. The reason&#xD;
           for wait-listing is to ensure that there will be a control group to parallel the first 3&#xD;
           months of intervention therapy in the patients getting the therapy from the start. The&#xD;
           control group will have the same time points for data assessment as the intervention&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
           iv. All interventions will be individual sessions. v. Patients will be accessed via&#xD;
           internet apps such as Skype. vi. Mindfulness-based stress reduction is to be given by&#xD;
           specially trained therapists: These are social workers (PhD or Masters candidate level),&#xD;
           who have undergone a training session program provided by relevant researchers of this&#xD;
           protocol (including clinicians) as well as invited outside psychologists and&#xD;
           psychiatrists with specialization in this field.&#xD;
&#xD;
           vii. Psycho-social, medical and biological data will be collected at the measurement&#xD;
           points T1, T2, T3 and T4 (see Table) in all patients. fMRI (to be performed at Soroka&#xD;
           Medical Center, without use of contrast) and microbiota studies (stool samples) will be&#xD;
           performed on a subset of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           d. Health-care cost i. Direct costs: admissions to hospital, surgery, consultations&#xD;
           (primary care physicians, specialists, dieticians, social services) investigations and&#xD;
           medications, travel costs to medical facilities.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Indirect costs: lost workdays, lost productivity, disability payments, travel costs&#xD;
           and expenses of escorts.&#xD;
&#xD;
           e. Immune regulation studies, glucocorticoid resistance in lymphocytes, telomeres i.&#xD;
           Blood collections (see Table of events, below) will be performed on consenting patients&#xD;
           with Crohn's disease before and after Mindfulness-based stress reduction at 3 time&#xD;
           points, as well as in age- and gender-matched consenting healthy volunteer controls&#xD;
           (consenting patients without inflammatory diseases attending at the Gastroenterology&#xD;
           Department at Soroka Medical Center for screening endoscopies) at one time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii. Blood will be drawn immunological and telomere studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Immunology: Blood is sampled twice from 60 Crohn's disease and from 60 controls for&#xD;
      isolation of serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cell aliquots at enrollment and after&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based stress reduction (provided these patients enter a phase of remission).&#xD;
      Serum measures will include plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), ACTH, CBG and sex hormones.&#xD;
      Similarly, peripheral blood mononuclear cell will undergo functional immune phenotyping of&#xD;
      disease-implicated T cell and B cell subsets and assessments of their glucocorticoid&#xD;
      resistance. Glucocorticoid signaling experiments will be performed in purified&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory lymphocyte subsets found to exhibit glucocorticoid resistance. Results will&#xD;
      be correlated with all other measures in this proposal. Controls for these tests will be&#xD;
      matched healthy volunteers. The same tests will be carried out in the controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2. Telomere studies in 30 patients with Crohn's disease and 30 controls: by TeloTAGGGâ„¢&#xD;
      Telomere Length Assay (Merck). Two blood samples will be needed (see Table of events, below)&#xD;
      f. Stool testing - stool samples will be collected at T1 and T2 i. Calprotectin will be&#xD;
      measured in the stool at T1 and T2. ii. Microbiota study will be performed on 30 intervention&#xD;
      patients and 30 control patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      g. fMRI - A non-contrast brain MRI will be performed on 30 intervention and 30 control&#xD;
      patients at T1 and T2&#xD;
