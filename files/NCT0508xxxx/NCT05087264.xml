  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Indocyanine green was injected intravenously into patients with cervical cancer before&#xD;
      operation. The nerve development was observed by infrared imaging system during operation,&#xD;
      which was used as the basis for nerve preserving operation of type C cervical cancer. The&#xD;
      recovery of bladder function was observed.&#xD;

      This study is an open, randomized and prospective clinical study. 86 patients are planned to&#xD;
      be randomly assigned according to 1:1. 43 patients underwent preoperative intravenous&#xD;
      injection of indocyanine green, radical resection of q-mc1 cervical cancer under pelvic&#xD;
      autonomic nerve fluorescence, and 43 patients underwent routine surgery to observe the medium&#xD;
      and long-term urinary system function and pelvic floor function of the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before operation, confirm the pathological type, pelvic and abdominal enhancement CT or MRI&#xD;
      examination, urography (if necessary), two researchers with senior professional title of&#xD;
      gynecology respectively carry out gynecological double diagnosis and triple diagnosis&#xD;
      examination, and carry out clinical staging according to figo2018 staging standard; According&#xD;
      to NCCN guidelines, subjects who are suitable for radical resection of q-m type C1 cervical&#xD;
      cancer (IB1 stage deep interstitial Infiltrator / ib2-iia2 stage) are enrolled for routine&#xD;
      preoperative examination, and surgical contraindications are excluded. The operation method&#xD;
      is open radical resection of q-m C1 cervical cancer. The same group of researchers with rich&#xD;
      experience in gynecological tumor operation act as the chief surgeon. Gradually open the&#xD;
      retroperitoneum, walk along the ureter to complete anatomical exposure, observe and record&#xD;
      the fluorescence staining degree of pelvic autonomic nerve at different time nodes, and&#xD;
      compare with the surrounding blood vessels / lymphatic vessels / adipose tissue, Observe the&#xD;
      bladder branch of pelvic visceral nerve, dissociate the pelvic visceral nerve plexus from the&#xD;
      rectum uterus / rectocervical ligament, preserve the nerve tissue behind the ureter and&#xD;
      bladder, and perform extensive resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The shape map of pelvic autonomic nerve (including near-infrared region I and region II) was&#xD;
      developed. The researchers recorded the identification of nerve after operation and recorded&#xD;
      the best observation time point.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers recorded the operation time, the amount of bleeding, the length of the&#xD;
      resected uterosacral ligament, main ligament and bladder cervical ligament, and the distal&#xD;
      margin was reserved for nerve staining and quantitative analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety observation: allergic reaction, influence on liver and kidney function, influence on&#xD;
      hemagglutination state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Observation of recent indicators of bladder dysfunction after operation: the catheter was&#xD;
      removed 1 week after operation, and the residual urine volume was measured by&#xD;
      ultrasonography. The catheter was placed again if it was &gt; 100ml, and then rechecked once a&#xD;
      week until the residual urine volume was less than 30ml.&#xD;
