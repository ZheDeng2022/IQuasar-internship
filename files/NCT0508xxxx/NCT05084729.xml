  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This registry has been designed to obtain real-life, post-market data on the use of the&#xD;
      Imagio breast imaging system. This registry is sponsored by Seno Medical Instruments, Inc.,&#xD;
      the manufacturer of the device.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, controlled, multi-center, observational international registry&#xD;
      designed to evaluate the Imagio breast imaging system. The registry will be conducted at up&#xD;
      to 12 international centers. Investigators will use Imagio US (IUS) and/or Imagio OA/US&#xD;
      imaging per standard of care, anddata will be collected accordingly. Additional imaging and&#xD;
      biopsy/surgery will be conducted per standard of care to reach a final diagnosis.&#xD;

        A total of up to 600 subjects will be enrolled in the registry in up to 12 sites in the EU&#xD;
        and US, with a maximum of 50-100 subjects per site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects with lesions/masses presenting with BI-RADS 0-6 will be enrolled. Enrollment into&#xD;
        the registry will allow for only 100 lesions/masses presenting with BI-RADS 1 and 2 breast&#xD;
        imaging findings and evaluated with the Imagio breast imaging system and 50 lesions/masses&#xD;
        presenting with BI-RADS 0 findings and evaluated with the Imagio breast imaging system.&#xD;
        This limitation is applicable in order to ensure a cross section of BI-RADS categories&#xD;
        enrolled in the registry.&#xD;
