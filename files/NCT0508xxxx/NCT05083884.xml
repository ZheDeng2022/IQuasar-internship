  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is an online survey of women in and around menopause with moderate to severe hot&#xD;
      flashes. Menopause, a normal part of life, is a time after a woman's last period. Hot flashes&#xD;
      often occur during menopause. They can disrupt a woman's daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is about collecting information only. There will be no treatment in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will provide information about how many women have moderate to severe hot flashes&#xD;
      in menopause. It will also provide details on women's experiences with hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Women from Brazil, Canada, Nordic Europe, and Mexico will take part in this study. The women&#xD;
      in this study will already be taking part in consumer panels. Women will be contacted based&#xD;
      on their age. They will be asked if they would like to take part in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, the women will answer questions about whether they are in menopause or are getting&#xD;
      close to menopause. They will also be asked how severe their hot flashes are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From their answers, some women will be asked to complete an online survey. These will be&#xD;
      women who are in menopause and have moderate to severe hot flashes. They will provide more&#xD;
      details about how hot flashes have impacted their lives. Also, they will answer questions on&#xD;
      how hot flashes affect their quality of life. Finally, they will answer questions about their&#xD;
      experiences when they visited their doctor about their hot flashes.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Prevalence of moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms (VMS) in post-menopausal women</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (once through survey)</time_frame>
    <description>Prevalence of moderate to severe VMS in post-menopausal women. Post-menopause is defined as at least 12 consecutive months without a period. Moderate VMS associated with menopause symptoms is defined as sensations of heat with sweating but being able to continue activities. Severe VMS associated with menopause is defined as feelings of intense heat with sweating causing cessation of activities. The recall period is 1 month prior to survey.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measured by the Menopause Specific QoL Questionnaire (MENQoL)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (once through survey)</time_frame>
    <description>MENQoL measures the overall score and four domain-specific scores assessing wellbeing (vasomotor; psychosocial; physical; sexual). Scores range from 1 to 8 with a higher score indicating worsening/increasing bothersomeness by the symptom experience. The MENQoL recall period is 7 days prior to survey.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measured by Work Productivity and Activity Impairment-VMS (WPAI-VMS) Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (once through survey)</time_frame>
    <description>The WPAI-VMS questionnaire measures four domain specific scores assessing work productivity and activity impairment over the previous week (absenteeism; presenteeism; mean work productivity; activity impairment). Scores range from 0 to 100%. The four scores were expressed as impairment percentages with a higher score indicating less productivity and greater activity impairment. The WPAI recall period is 7 days prior to survey.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measured by Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System - Sleep Disturbance (PROMIS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (once through survey)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS Sleep Disturbance instrument assesses self-reported perceptions of sleep quality, sleep depth, and restoration associated with sleep. This includes perceived difficulties and concerns with getting to sleep or staying asleep, as well as perceptions of the adequacy of and satisfaction with sleep. Each item on the measure is rated on a 5-point scale with a range in score from 8 to 40 with higher scores indicating greater severity of sleep disturbance. The PROMIS recall period is 7 days prior to survey.&#xD;
(Only implemented in Canada, Brazil and Denmark).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants with VMS seeking healthcare professionals' (HCP) advice</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (once through survey)</time_frame>
    <description>The type of specialists reported by peri- and post-menopausal women will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants with VMS taking over the counter treatment for moderate to severe VMS symptoms</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (once through survey)</time_frame>
    <description>The types of over the counter treatment taken by peri- and post-menopausal women for MR symptoms will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Proportion of Participants incurring average out-of-pocket expenses incurred in treatment of menopause</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (once through survey)</time_frame>
    <description>Average out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the treatment of menopause reported by medications bought will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of peri-and post-menopausal women who seek help from HCPs for their menopause related symptoms (MR-VMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (once through survey)</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of peri- and post-menopausal women who seek help from Health Care Professionals (HCPs) for their MR-VMS. Help from an HCP can be in the form of advice or receipt of pharmaceutical treatment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Health Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) measured by participants' attitudes to their VMS</measure>
    <time_frame>1 day (once through survey)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants' attitudes towards their VMS will be evaluated using the following: agreement or disagreement to statements on menopause itself, available treatments, and willingness/aversion to hormone replacement therapy (HRT).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment patterns of peri- and post-menopausal women assessed by type of treatment</measure>
