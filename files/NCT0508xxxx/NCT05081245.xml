  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ML-004-002 is a Phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo- controlled study&#xD;
      that will enroll approximately 150 adolescent and adult subjects with ASD. The primary&#xD;
      objective of the study will be to evaluate the efficacy of ML-004 compared with placebo for&#xD;
      the treatment of care/study partner-reported social communication deficits in patients with&#xD;
      ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to study treatment in a 1:1 ratio of ML-004: placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will begin with 2 weeks of once daily dosing of ML-004 or placebo followed by a&#xD;
      9-12 day dose-titration phase until the maximum allowable tolerated dose (based on subject&#xD;
      weight) is reached. The maximum dose tolerated during dose titration will become the&#xD;
      maintenance dose (MD) for that subject, and the subject will remain on this dose for 12&#xD;
      weeks, followed by a down titration. An independent DSMC will monitor trial progress and&#xD;
      ensure that the safety of trial subjects is not compromised.&#xD;

    <measure>Change from Baseline in Autism Behavior Inventory (ABI)-Social Communication Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>Change from baseline in the ABI-Social Communication Domain Score will be reported. The ABI is a 62-item questionnaire for reporting the behaviors of subjects (ages: 3 years-adulthood) diagnosed with ASD. The tool is suitable for completion by parents or care/study partners of people with ASD. Each item assesses either quality (from not at all to without help) or frequency (never to very often) of a particular behavior. The Social Communication domain score is the sum of the scores in the social communication domain divided by the number of items in the domain.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Clinician Global Impression of Improvement (CGI-I)</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-I score is a single-item instrument based on a 7-point scale routinely used in clinical trials to capture the Investigator's global impression of response. The Investigator or designee rates the improvement observed from 1 (very much improved) to 7 (very much worse).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Autism Behavior Inventory-Clinician (ABI-C) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>The ABI-Clinician (ABI-C) captures the clinician rating of behaviors of a person with ASD that occurred over the week prior to assessment. It contains 14 items reflecting the core and associated autism behavior domains: Social Communication, Restrictive Behaviors, Mood and Anxiety, Self Regulation, and Challenging Behavior. Each item is rated on a 7-point scale from 1 (none; no symptoms present) to 7 (very severe; persistent interference with function or adaptation).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from Baseline in Aberrant Behavior Checklist 2-Irritability (ABC-I) Subscale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>The ABC is a parent- or care/study partner-reported behavior rating assessment with five domains and 58 items, each rated on a 0 (not a problem) to 3 (the problem is severe in degree) scale. The irritability domain consists of 15 items.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the Clinician Global Impression of Severity (CGI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>The CGI-S is a global assessment of the clinician-rater's impression of the severity of the participant's illness. It is rated on a scale of 1 (normal, not at all ill) to 7 (among the most extremely ill).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the ABI Repetitive/Restrictive Behavior Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>Each item on the ABI-Repetitive/Restrictive Behavior Domain is rated by frequency (0=never to 3=very often). The domain score is the sum of all domain items scores divided by the number of items in the domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the ABI Mood and Anxiety Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>Each item on the ABI- Mood and Anxiety Domain is rated by frequency (0=never to 3=very often). The domain score is the sum of all domain items scores divided by the number of items in the domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the ABI Challenging Behavior Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>Each item on the ABI- Challenging Behavior Domain is rated by frequency (0=never to 3=very often). The domain score is the sum of all domain items scores divided by the number of items in the domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the ABI Self-regulation Domain Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>Each item on the ABI- Self-regulation Domain is rated by frequency (0=never to 3=very often). The domain score is the sum of all domain items scores divided by the number of items in the domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the ABI-Short Form (ABI-S) Score</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Day 110</time_frame>
    <description>The ABI-S is a 24-item short version of the ABI, containing items from each of the five domains. The domain score for each domain is calculated as the sum of scores all domain items divided by the number of items in the domain.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
