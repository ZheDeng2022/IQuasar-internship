  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A randomized controlled trial was conducted on 72 diagnosed patients with cervical&#xD;
      spondylosis at University of Lahore Teaching hospital. The study was completed within 9&#xD;
      months after the approval of synopsis. Patients who fulfill the inclusion criteria were&#xD;
      identified by individual physiotherapist and were enrolled for particular study. Informed&#xD;
      written consent was be taken by the patients and were randomly allocated into two groups. The&#xD;
      total numbers of sessions were 12 (3 sessions per week). The study was single blinded. The&#xD;
      assessor was unaware of the treatment given to both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control group received only routine physical therapy. This includes thermotherapy,&#xD;
      trans-cutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, neck isometrics and stretching that includes 12&#xD;
      sessions and three times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Experimental group received routine physical therapy along with breathing exercises. This&#xD;
      includes thermotherapy, trans-cutaneous electrical nerve stimulation, neck isometrics and&#xD;
      stretching that includes 12 sessions and three times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline data was collected before first treatment then after 4th, 8th and 12th session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures were neck pain, ROM, neck disability and quality of life and were&#xD;
      analyzed by using SPSS 26 and then results and conclusion were drawn.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in SF-36 Questionnaire score</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from pre-intervention to 4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 Questionnaire was used to assess quality of life. Scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability.</description>
