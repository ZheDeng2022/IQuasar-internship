  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Brachial plexus block is a good choice for surgeries of the upper limb because it&#xD;
      provides good quality of anesthesia and analgesia especially in patients with multiple&#xD;
      comorbidities and in ambulatory surgery. Hyalaluronidase is a local anesthetic adjuvant used&#xD;
      for ophthalmologic surgery. We evaluated the effect of adding hyaluronidase to bupivacaine as&#xD;
      regard the onset and duration of motor and sensory block in ultrasound guided supraclavicular&#xD;
      brachial plexus block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology prospective, randomized and double-blind study conducted at Sohag University&#xD;
      Hospital. A total of 40 adults scheduled for upper limb surgery, ASA I or II were randomly&#xD;
      assigned into two groups (n=20). Group I received bupivacaine 0.375 % 15 mL + normal saline&#xD;
      4ml +hyaluronidase 800 IUin 1 ml. Group II received bupivacaine 0.375% 15 mL + normal saline5&#xD;
      ml. Both groups will be compared for onset and duration of sensory and motor block, duration&#xD;
      of analgesia and complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results The onset of sensory and motor block was significantly faster in hyaluronidase group&#xD;
      than control group. Significant difference could not be detected in either duration of the&#xD;
      sensory or motor block between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion The use of hyaluronidase as an additive to bupivacaine fastens the onset of&#xD;
      sensory and motor block of the brachial plexus in supraclavicular approach without affecting&#xD;
      the duration of the block.&#xD;

      This prospective, randomized, controlled and double-blind study was conducted at Sohag&#xD;
      University Hospital after approval from institution review board and obtaining written&#xD;
      informed consents from all participants. Forty participants, aged 18 to 60 years, American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II, scheduled for elective surgery of the upper&#xD;
      extremities were included in this study. Participants who refuse or have allergy to local&#xD;
      anesthetic or hyaluronidase or suffering from severe renal, hepatic, pulmonary, cardiac,&#xD;
      neurologic, psychiatric or neuromuscular disease will be excluded from the study in addition&#xD;
      to pregnant or lactating women, patients with morbid obesity, coagulation disorders as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sealed envelopes technique was used to randomly assign patients to both study groups; Group&#xD;
      I; received bupivacaine 0.375 % 15 mL + normal saline 4ml +hyaluronidase 800 IU in 1 ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II; received bupivacaine 0.375% 15 mL + normal saline5 ml. After arriving to the&#xD;
      operative theater basic monitoring was applied and intravenous line was inserted. Midazolam&#xD;
      2mg and Fentanyl 50 mcg was administered intravenously to all participants 15 minutes before&#xD;
      the procedure. Anesthesiologist who carried out the block and recorded the study measurements&#xD;
      was blinded to the treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants were in supine position with the head rotated to the opposite side and neck&#xD;
      extended, 7 to 12 MHz linear ultrasound probe (SonoScape A5, SonoScape Co., Ltd., China) was&#xD;
      placed above the clavicle to identify distal trunks or proximal divisions of the brachial&#xD;
      plexus lateral and cephalad to the subclavian artery above the first rib. After ultrasound&#xD;
      pre-scan and local infiltration with 3ml lidocaine 2%, 100 mm, 20 gauge nerve-stimulating&#xD;
      needle (LocoplexÂ®, VYGON, FRANCE) was inserted under real time ultrasound guided technique in&#xD;
      line approach and advanced until reaching the brachial plexus sheath the needle was&#xD;
      repositioned to allow local anesthetic spread around all trunks or divisions. Injection was&#xD;
      stopped if an increased resistance to injection experienced or parathesia to avoid intra&#xD;
      neural injection. All participants were transferred to post-anesthesia care unit&#xD;
      postoperatively to be observed for the following measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary measurement:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Onset of complete sensory block (time from injection to complete sensory block to pin&#xD;
           prick).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Onset of complete motor block (time from injection to complete motor block).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Duration of analgesia defined as time from injection to first analgesia request.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of sensory block (time between injection and complete recovery of sensation)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of motor block (time between injection and complete recovery of motor power)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Side effects and complications (hypotension, sedation, nausea vomiting, dry mouth,&#xD;
           hematoma or pneumothorax, neuropathy) Participants were allowed to receive analgesia as&#xD;
           ketorolac 30 mg intramuscularly as a rescue analgesia if VAS &gt; 4.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performing the power analysis of the study , it is decided that each group should&#xD;
      contain at least a minimum of 18 cases (90% power and 0.05%alpha error).Considering possible&#xD;
      data loss due to technical reasons, each group was decided to be 20 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recorded data were subjected to statistical analysis using Statistical Package for Social&#xD;
      Sciences (SPSS), Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis of demographic and&#xD;
      hemodynamic data while unpaired t-test was applied for onset time and duration of sensory and&#xD;
      motor blocks and was reconfirmed with the Wilcoxon W and Mann-Whitney U tests. Statistical&#xD;
      significance was defined by P-value &lt; 0.05. chi-square/Fischer's exact test was used for&#xD;
      analysis of adverse effects.&#xD;
