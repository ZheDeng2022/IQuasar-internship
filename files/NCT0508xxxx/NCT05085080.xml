    <textblock>
      Extracorporeal life support (ECLS), also known as extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO),&#xD;
      is an extracorporeal technique which provides respiratory and cardiac support to patients&#xD;
      with respiratory and/or heart failure. Neonates account for a significant proportion of&#xD;
      patients requiring ECLS support. While with unique pathophysiology among newborn infants,&#xD;
      neonatal ECLS treatment faces different challenges (such as specific indications,&#xD;
      anticoagulation, hemodynamic management, high incidences of complications, ect.) from those&#xD;
      of elder children or adults. Though neonatal ECMO has been used in developed countries since&#xD;
      1970s, the introduction of neonatal ECMO in China was not reported until 2010s. While on the&#xD;
      other hand, there has been a rapid increase of neonatal ECLS cases and centers in China in&#xD;
      the past decade with a huge variation of numbers of cases and quality among different&#xD;
      centers. Therefore, there is an urgent need to monitor the use and quality of neonatal ECLS&#xD;
      in China. The goal of the Chinese Neonatal Extracorporeal Life Support Registry (Chi-NELS) is&#xD;
      to maintain a registry of use of ECLS in active neonatal ECLS centers across China, to&#xD;
      support quality improvement of neonatal ELCS, clinical research and regulatory agencies.&#xD;

      This study aims to establish a neonatal ECLS network of all active ECLS centers in China to&#xD;
      facilitate standardization of care and collaborative research. On the basis of the network,&#xD;
      this prospective comprehensive registry will enroll all neonates who receive ECLS support in&#xD;
      participating centers. The indications, managements, complications and outcomes of neonatal&#xD;
      ECLS in China will be described in detail, to monitor the development of neonatal ECLS in&#xD;
      China, to identify targets for quality improvement, to assist in reducing mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity of neonates requiring ECLS support, and to facilitate innovative clinical&#xD;
      researches.&#xD;
