  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-armed observational study and feasibility trial of a remote&#xD;
      electronically-delivered integrated care pathway for the treatment of adolescents. Eligible&#xD;
      participants are between the ages of 13 and 18, inclusive, who have a primary diagnosis of&#xD;
      major depressive disorder. Outcomes of interest are recruitment rates and participation in&#xD;
      pathway components, including: appointments, measure-completion and use of&#xD;
      electronically-delivered cognitive behavioural therapy.&#xD;

      Introduction: Depression is common and debilitating in the adolescent age range. Geography or&#xD;
      other logistical barriers may prevent youth from accessing care. Progress in the treatment of&#xD;
      youth that uses their tendencies to engage in electronically mediated contacts (e.g., text,&#xD;
      online videos, and livestream video chat) can strategically address depressive disorders to&#xD;
      overcome these barriers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The Principal Investigator will conduct a pilot single-arm trial to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility of a 16-week remote electronically delivered integrated care pathway (ICP) for&#xD;
      the treatment of adolescents (age 13-18) with major depressive disorder. CBT components being&#xD;
      delivered has been tested in the age 18-30 with depression. The ICP includes: tele-psychiatry&#xD;
      appointments, online measurement-based care, internet-based cognitive behavioural therapy&#xD;
      combined with mindfulness training, and text-based health coaching. Eligible subjects will be&#xD;
      recruited from Child, Youth and Family services at the Centre for Addiction and Mental&#xD;
      Health. The Principal Investigator aims to recruit 12 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes: Feasibility outcomes are of the primary interest; namely, recruitment rates,&#xD;
      proportion of psychiatry appointments attended, proportion of self-report measures completed,&#xD;
      proportion of online CBT videos viewed, number of text-exchanges between youth and health&#xD;
      coaches, physical activity levels and qualitative feedback from youth about their&#xD;
      experiences. Primary clinical outcomes will be described via self-reported depressive&#xD;
      symptoms using the Mood and Feelings Questionnaire. Secondary outcomes include self-reported&#xD;
      anxiety (anxiety-related subscales of the Revised Children's Anxiety and Depression Scale)&#xD;
      and function (Youth Columbia Impairment Scale). The Principal Investigator will also measure&#xD;
      self-injurious thoughts and behaviours using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: If results confirm hypotheses that youth can be feasibly treated with a remote&#xD;
      electronically delivered ICP, further efficacy testing may be performed to assess this as a&#xD;
      viable option for service delivery that reduces barriers to care.&#xD;

    <description>The remote electronically-delivered ICP (also known as eCARIBOU) will consist of psychiatry appointments through telemedicine every 4 weeks over 16 weeks, where the youth is at home. Prior to these appointments, measures (i.e., Mood and Feelings Questionnaire - MFQ) will be sent to the youth to be completed. Change in measure scores will be reviewed collaboratively between the psychiatrist and the youth to assist in making treatment decisions. The medication algorithm in the in-person ICP will be used to guide these decisions. The psychiatrist will also administer the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) at each telepsychiatry appointment to monitor risk. Concurrently, youth will be offered internet-based Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (iCBT) and health-coaching via text.</description>
