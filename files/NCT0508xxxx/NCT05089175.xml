      1. Evaluation of the efficacy of aspirin in preventing preeclampsia and its serious&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) is the second leading cause of maternal death in&#xD;
      clinical practice. The prediction and prevention of HDP and its serious complications could&#xD;
      be a breakthrough to further reduce the maternal mortality rate in China. Aspirin (ASP) is&#xD;
      widely used clinically as a first-line prevention program for preeclampsia (PE). However, how&#xD;
      to determine the effectiveness of ASP prevention before the onset of PE high-risk pregnant&#xD;
      women and adjust the risk monitoring plan accordingly has become a clinical difficult point.&#xD;
      Two prospective and observational researches will be lauched in this study. In the first part&#xD;
      of this study, ASP resistance test and HDP-related biomarkers will be combined to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of ASP on the prevention of PE from multiple dimensions, and placental pathology&#xD;
      will be analyzed to assist evaluate, in order to more comprehensively evaluate the preventive&#xD;
      effect of aspirin in high-risk of PE pregnant women in the first and second trimester. In the&#xD;
      second part of this study, we aim to reduce the incidence of serious HDP complications and&#xD;
      improve maternal and child outcomes for pregnant women with HDP who have missed HDP&#xD;
      prediction and prevention opportunities in the first trimester, or aspirin prevention is&#xD;
      ineffective. It is planned to establish a risk prediction model for severe pregnancy&#xD;
      complications in pregnant women with HDP by adding other biological and physical indicators&#xD;
      on the basis of maternal factors, in order to more accurately predict one or several severe&#xD;
      complications of HDP over a period of time.&#xD;

    <description>According to the ISSHP, PE is defined as systolic blood pressure at ≥140 mm Hg and/or diastolic blood pressure at ≥90 mm Hg on at least two occasions measured 4 hours apart in previously normotensive women and is accompanied by one or more of the following new onset conditions at or after 20 weeks of gestation:&#xD;
Proteinuria (i.e. ≥30 mg/mol protein:creatinine ratio;&#xD;
≥300 mg/24 hour; or ≥2 + dipstick);&#xD;
Evidence of other maternal organ dysfunction, including: acute kidney injury (creatinine ≥90 μmol/L; 1 mg/dL); liver involvement (elevated transaminases, e.g. alanine aminotransferase or aspartate aminotransferase &gt;40 IU/L) with or without right upper quadrant or epigastric abdominal pain; neurological complications ; or hematological complications ; or&#xD;
