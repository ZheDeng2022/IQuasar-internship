  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An assessment of the feasibility of structural and functional magnetic resonance imaging&#xD;
      (MRI) brain scans in older people who have recovered from and older people who never had&#xD;
      delirium after hip fracture surgery&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative delirium, an acute sate of confusion occurs with higher frequency in older&#xD;
      people. Hip fracture surgery is a procedure associated with an increased risk of&#xD;
      postoperative delirium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study the feasibility of achieving structure and functional connectivity imaging of&#xD;
      the brain, using magnetic resonance imaging, in older people who are recovering from hip&#xD;
      fracture surgery will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People who have recovered from post operative delirium and people who did not have&#xD;
      postoperative delirium will be included.&#xD;
