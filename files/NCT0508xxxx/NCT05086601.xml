  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to establish a colorectal cancer cohort, collect clinicopathological&#xD;
      information, collect biological samples for multi-omics testing, and perform relevant&#xD;
      analysis, to predict the prognosis of colorectal cancer, guide the diagnosis and treatment of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and the formulation of health policies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators will establish a database to collect clinical pathological&#xD;
      information, based on the medical data system of participating medical centers. The&#xD;
      investigators will also collect corresponding tumor specimens and perform multiple omics&#xD;
      tests such as genome, transcriptome, and proteome. The investigators will aggregate these&#xD;
      data into a special database, and use appropriate methods to conduct big data analysis, to&#xD;
      predict prognosis, guide diagnosis and treatment, and assist in formulating health policies.&#xD;

    <time_frame>1 month after surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The pathological TNM stage included the pathological T stage, pathological N stage and M stage. The pathological T and N stage is decided according to the removed specimen of the primary tumor by the pathologist after surgery. The M stage is decided according to the imaging tests as CT, MRI and PET-CT.</description>
