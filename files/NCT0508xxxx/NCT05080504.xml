      This study will enroll heart failure (HF) patients who are under active management with an&#xD;
      implanted pulmonary artery pressure sensor (CardioMEMS). Subjects will be provided an&#xD;
      electronic stethoscope (the Eko DUO) to take at-home heart sound, lung sound, and ECG&#xD;
      recordings in conjunction with regimented CardioMEMS measurements. These two datasets will be&#xD;
      used to confirm whether an AI/ML model to track HF status can be developed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure (HF) affects an estimated 6.2 million Americans over the age of 20 and carries&#xD;
      a very high healthcare system burden worldwide. Annual costs for HF management in the United&#xD;
      States were estimated at $30.7 billion in 2012 and are projected to increase to $68.7 billion&#xD;
      by 2030. The primary cost driver for HF management is a high rate of acute decompensation and&#xD;
      subsequent hospitalization. The mean per-patient cost of an HF-related hospitalization is&#xD;
      estimated to be $14,631.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the conditions that the Centers of Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) monitors for&#xD;
      their Hospital Readmission Reduction Program, HF has the highest median readmission rate at&#xD;
      days 1-29 (23%) and days 1-60 (11.4%) postdischarge. The cost burden of HF readmission is&#xD;
      $2.7 billion in 2013. A meta-analysis from 2012 estimated that 23.1% of HF readmissions are&#xD;
      avoidable, although individual studies ranged from 5% to 79%. Many health plans, including&#xD;
      CMS, have focused on interventions that monitor patients for early detection of HF&#xD;
      decompensation. Earlier interventions can help care teams prevent avoidable hospitalizations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Invasive hemodynamic sensor devices have enabled HF care teams to better predict and prevent&#xD;
      HF decompensation events, and thus prevent rehospitalizations. One such device is the&#xD;
      CardioMEMS pulmonary artery (PA) sensor (Abbott Inc., Atlanta, GA, USA). The CardioMEMS is&#xD;
      implanted in a branch of the left PA, allowing for daily measurements of PA pressures. PA&#xD;
      pressures are used as a surrogate marker of filling pressure, and rising filling pressures,&#xD;
      in turn, are a marker that precedes the exacerbation of HF. The CHAMPIONS trial demonstrated&#xD;
      that remote diuretic management using CardioMEMS reduced HF all-cause hospitalizations by 43%&#xD;
      and mortality by 57%. Unfortunately, CardioMEMS as an HF solution is invasive, costly&#xD;
      (average sales price of $17,750), indicated for a restricted patient population (NYHA class&#xD;
      III HF who have been hospitalized within the last year), and has limited reimbursement&#xD;
      coverage due to equivocal cost-effectiveness projections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This has stimulated a search for less expensive, non-invasive sensors that may correlate with&#xD;
      fluid status in HF patients. A study in Taiwan demonstrated that outpatient therapy guided by&#xD;
      an inpatient device with ECG and sound sensors reduced post-discharge HF utilization by 31%&#xD;
      when compared to a control group using symptoms to guide therapy. The LINK-HF study&#xD;
      demonstrated that a wearable patch with ECG and sound sensors could predict HF readmissions&#xD;
      with a sensitivity of 76% to 88%, a specificity of 85%, and a median lead time of 6.5 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these initially promising results, however, these devices have significant&#xD;
      disadvantages. The inpatient device used in the Taiwanese study could not be adapted into a&#xD;
      portable form factor for outpatient use. Wearable devices can be rigid, uncomfortable, and&#xD;
      highly visible, all of which can interfere with patient function and decrease monitoring&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, there remains an unmet clinical need for a widely available, non-invasive,&#xD;
      affordable medical device that can estimate an HF patient's hemodynamic fluid status and&#xD;
      inform the HF care management team. The ultimate goal remains to decrease an HF patient's&#xD;
      risk for hospital readmission, all from the comfort of the patient's home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To meet this need, Eko has developed the DUO, an FDA-cleared, portable, hand-held, wirelessly&#xD;
      connected medical device with ECG and sound sensors. Data from the DUO can be wirelessly&#xD;
      streamed to a mobile phone or tablet, which can then be transmitted to a HIPAA-compliant&#xD;
      internet cloud infrastructure for storage and analysis. In 2020, Eko introduced into the US&#xD;
      market a package of AI/ML algorithms that follows this workflow to identify heart murmurs,&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation, and other cardiac conditions, and intends after this proof of concept&#xD;
      study to build upon this platform to estimate and trend PA pressures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      But beyond measuring and trending PA pressures, the DUO can be used to capture additional&#xD;
      important HF features that will further improve any HF algorithm's performance. For example,&#xD;
      because patients with decompensated HF often have an audible third heart sound,&#xD;
      characteristic ECG findings, and altered time interval durations between their heart sounds&#xD;
      and ECG signals, the Eko DUO device may be uniquely positioned to detect these types of&#xD;
      changing signals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, because heart failure and fluid overload are reflected in the lungs as crackles&#xD;
      (and occasionally effusions), the lung examination is and has always been a cornerstone of&#xD;
      the overall physical examination of HF patients. By using the DUO to capture lung sounds in&#xD;
      patients with HF, and comparing not only the presence or absence of crackles, but also how&#xD;
      these adventitious sounds change over time, we will be able to explore the utility of the Eko&#xD;
      DUO in helping to predict exacerbated HF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This proof-of-concept study evaluates the feasibility of the Eko DUO in capturing and&#xD;
      measuring signals relevant to HF exacerbation (e.g., time intervals, adventitious lungs&#xD;
      sounds, pathologic heart sounds), as well as the feasibility of developing an AI/ML algorithm&#xD;
      to model PA pressures in HF patients with the implantable CardioMEMS device.&#xD;
