  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a prospective, single-center, comparative, cross-over study with within-subject&#xD;
      control design. In the investigation an updated sound processor will be tested at compared to&#xD;
      the CE marked Ponto 3 SuperPower sound processor (available on the market since December&#xD;
      2016) in order to establish marketing claim(s) on the updated sound processor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The performance of the two sound processors will be evaluated via speech and hearing tests,&#xD;
      and patient reported outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigation is a premarket investigation with the purpose of gathering knowledge on the&#xD;
      performance of an updated sound processor compared to the CE marked Ponto 3 SuperPower sound&#xD;
      processor to establish marketing claim(s) on the updated sound processor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment for this clinical investigation will be performed among subjects who have&#xD;
      already received a Ponto 3 SuperPower sound processor as a minimum three month prior to the&#xD;
      study. 12-15 adult Ponto 3 SuperPower users with a conductive, mixed hearing loss or&#xD;
      single-sided deafness will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is a prospective, single-center, comparative, cross-over study with within-subject&#xD;
      control design. The study includes four laboratory visits and three field trial periods.&#xD;
      After the first trial period, which is included to ensure a homogenous baseline, the study is&#xD;
      designed as a two-period, two-sequence crossover trial to compare the two sound processors&#xD;
      (Device A &amp; Device B). Each participant is randomized into one of two sequences: (1) Device A&#xD;
      then B, or (2) Device B then A, such that (about) half of the participants are assigned to&#xD;
      one sequence and the other half to the second sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to combine audiological assessments (hearing and speech tests) in the&#xD;
      laboratory and subjective self-reported outcomes collected during and after field trial&#xD;
      periods with the investigational device and the comparator device (Ponto 3 SuperPower). The&#xD;
      primary outcome of this study is to demonstrate that Open Sound Navigator in the updated&#xD;
      sound processor provides subjects with improved speech recognition in noise.&#xD;

    <masking_description>The participants are blinded to the tested conditions in the lab, used for assessment of the primary objective, but the participants are not blinded to the sound processors used during the three trial periods, due to different appearance of the sound processors, making it possible to distinguish between the sound processors.</masking_description>

             study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects who do not have the ability or are un-willing to follow investigational&#xD;
