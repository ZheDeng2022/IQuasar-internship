      To compare the postoperative analgesic effect of two ultrasound guided approaches of&#xD;
      quadratus lumborum block (QLB) (anterior and intramuscular) for radical cystectomy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is one of the abdominal wall block techniques used to&#xD;
      anesthetize thoracolumbar nerves [1]. The QLB technique was described initially by Blanco et&#xD;
      al. in 2007 (not published), then reported initially by Kadam [2] in 2013. Since then, QLB&#xD;
      has evolved with the development of the ultrasound-guided nerve block. To date, several&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials have reported effective postoperative analgesia, with&#xD;
      non-intramuscular QLB for cesarean section [3,4], laparoscopic gynecologic surgery [5] and&#xD;
      hip hemiarthroplasty [6]. At the moment, several approaches for QLB have been reported;&#xD;
      lateral (QLB type 1) [3], posterior (QLB type 2) [3], transmuscular (anterior) [7],&#xD;
      paramedian sagittal oblique [8], supra-iliac anterior [9], and intramuscular approaches [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intramuscular QLB (QLBi) technique was first reported by [10,11] in 2016. This approach&#xD;
      is different from others tubouchi for QLB; although the injection target sites of the other&#xD;
      approaches are planes around the quadratus lumborum muscle, the intramuscular approach&#xD;
      penetrates the fascia of the quadratus lumborum muscle in which local anesthetics are&#xD;
      injected. Therefore, QLBi is relatively easier to perform compared with other QLB approaches.&#xD;
      As there are only a few reports on QLBi in the clinical setting [10,11], its effectiveness&#xD;
      remains controversial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder cancer is an important worldwide health problem with a global estimate of 386,300 new&#xD;
      cases and 150,200 deaths in the year 2008. The majority of bladder cancer occurs in males and&#xD;
      there is a 14-fold variation in incidence internationally. The highest incidence rates are&#xD;
      found in the countries of Europe, North America, and Northern Africa. Smoking and&#xD;
      occupational exposure are the major risk factors in Western countries, while chronic&#xD;
      infection with Schistosoma Hematobium (SH) in developing countries, particularly in Africa&#xD;
      and the Middle East, accounts for the main total burden. (12) The incidence of urinary&#xD;
      bladder cancer in the Middle East and Africa is greater in areas with high rather than low SH&#xD;
      prevalence. The overall prevalence of SH infection in Egypt was 37-48% that decreased due to&#xD;
      the antibilharzial campaign to 3%. The urinary bladder cancer previously accounted for about&#xD;
      31% of the total incidence of cancers in Egypt that subsequently decreased to 12 %.(13)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radical cystectomy has traditionally been considered the standard of therapy for high-grade&#xD;
      invasive bladder cancer, with the best survival results and lowest local recurrence rates&#xD;
      reported to date . Radical cystectomy provides the optimum result for accurate pathological&#xD;
      staging, prevention of local recurrence and overall survival ]. In addition, radical&#xD;
      cystectomy may influence the decision for adjuvant chemotherapy based upon clear pathological&#xD;
      criteria&#xD;
