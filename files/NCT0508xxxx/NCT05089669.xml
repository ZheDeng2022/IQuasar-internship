  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is necessary for nursing students to have sufficient knowledge and correct nursing skill&#xD;
      before clinical practicum to provide patients appropriate care and improve nursing quality.&#xD;
      The learning materials of nursing skills are mainly paper textbooks and handouts, which are&#xD;
      one-way knowledge transmissions having limitations and deficiencies in nursing skill&#xD;
      learning. Interactive e-books integrate multimedia such as text, images, and videos, which&#xD;
      are more suitable for learning nursing skill and maximize the effectiveness of the learning&#xD;
      materials. The present study aimed to develop a nasogastric tube feeding interactive e-book&#xD;
      based on Information Processing Theory (IPT) and Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and&#xD;
      Satisfaction Motivational Model (ARCS), hoping to improve students' learning motivation and&#xD;
      learning effectiveness. This is a randomized controlled trial study. Convenience sampling&#xD;
      will be applied. The participants will be recruited and randomly assigned into the&#xD;
      experimental group and comparison group. The experimental group will read an interactive&#xD;
      e-book to learn nasogastric tube feeding, while the comparison group will read a paper&#xD;
      textbook.&#xD;

      It is necessary for nursing students to have sufficient knowledge and correct nursing skill&#xD;
      before clinical practicum to provide patients appropriate care and improve nursing quality.&#xD;
      The learning materials of nursing skills are mainly paper textbooks and handouts, which are&#xD;
      one-way knowledge transmissions having limitations and deficiencies in nursing skill&#xD;
      learning. Interactive e-books integrate multimedia such as text, images, and videos, which&#xD;
      are more suitable for learning nursing skill and maximize the effectiveness of the learning&#xD;
      materials. In addition, the learning content can be updated at any time, in order that&#xD;
      students can learn the latest skills and connect with clinical. The present study aimed to&#xD;
      develop a nasogastric tube feeding interactive e-book based on Information Processing Theory&#xD;
      (IPT) and Attention, Relevance, Confidence, and Satisfaction Motivational Model (ARCS),&#xD;
      hoping to improve students' learning motivation and learning effectiveness. Therefore, the&#xD;
      purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of using interactive e-book to enhance&#xD;
      nursing students' knowledge and learning self-efficacy of nursing skill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial study. Convenience sampling will be applied at a&#xD;
      university in Northern Taiwan. It is expected that 60-100 participants will be recruited and&#xD;
      randomly assigned into the experimental group and comparison group. The experimental group&#xD;
      will read an interactive e-book to learn nasogastric tube feeding, while the comparison group&#xD;
      will read a paper textbook. The questionnaires will be collected before the intervention,&#xD;
      after the intervention, and after one month of the intervention. The questionnaires include&#xD;
      demographic information, nasogastric tube feeding knowledge questionnaire, nasogastric tube&#xD;
      feeding confidence scale, learning self-efficacy scale, nasogastric tube feeding skill test,&#xD;
      and learning satisfaction questionnaire. This study will use SPSS 19.0 software for data&#xD;
      analysis, including percentage, mean, standard deviation, t-test, chi-square test, and&#xD;
      generalized estimation equation (GEE).&#xD;
