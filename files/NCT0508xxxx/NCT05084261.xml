  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of multiple ascending doses of BT051 in subjects with moderately to severely&#xD;
      active ulcerative colitis. Subjects will be randomised using a 3 active:1 placebo ratio to 3&#xD;
      ascending dose cohorts of 8 subjects and will be dosed daily for 28 days. The 3 initial dose&#xD;
      levels will be 200 mg, 800 mg and 3200 mg per day. Progression to the next cohort will be&#xD;
      based on the safety and tolerability of the previous cohort. An optional fourth cohort of up&#xD;
      to 20 additional subjects may be randomized 3 active:1 placebo at a dose no higher than 3200&#xD;
      mg at the discretion of the Sponsor.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo-controlled, multiple-ascending-dose (MAD) study enrolling&#xD;
      subjects with moderately to severely active UC. Subjects with prior exposure to biologic or&#xD;
      JAK inhibitors will be limited to 30% of the total subject population; those who have failed&#xD;
      2 or more biologic therapies (i.e., biologic and JAK inhibitor, 2 biologics in the same&#xD;
      class, or 2 biologics from different classes) will be limited to 20% of the total subject&#xD;
      population. Subjects will be randomized to one of 3 doses of oral BT051 (200 mg, 800 mg, or&#xD;
      3200 mg) or placebo, in ascending dose groups based on the safety and tolerability of the&#xD;
      previous cohort. Safety and tolerability will be assessed by a Safety Review Committee (SRC)&#xD;
      after all subjects in each cohort have completed at least 14 days of treatment, before&#xD;
      proceeding to the next higher dose cohort. The SRC may recommend that the next cohort proceed&#xD;
      with a higher dose as planned, or the SRC may recommend additional subjects be dosed at the&#xD;
      current, previous, or lower dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each planned dose escalation cohort (Cohorts 1-3) will include 8 subjects randomized 3:1 to&#xD;
      receive active drug or placebo. Starting with the lowest dose, each cohort of subjects will&#xD;
      receive once daily oral BT051 or placebo for a period of 28 days. Follow-up visits will be&#xD;
      performed at 7 and 30 days after the last dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optional fourth cohort of up to 20 additional subjects may be randomized 3:1&#xD;
      (active:placebo) at a dose no higher than 3200 mg at the discretion of the Sponsor.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provide written documentation of informed consent to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male or female aged 18 to 75 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a confirmed diagnosis of UC of at least 3 months' disease duration prior&#xD;
             to Screening (diagnosis established by endoscopy and histology).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Moderately to severely active UC, defined as a Mayo Score ≥6 points with a rectal&#xD;
             bleeding subscore ≥1 point, a stool frequency subscore ≥1 point, and moderate to&#xD;
             severe disease on endoscopy (Mayo endoscopic subscore [MES] ≥2 points).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects treated with stable doses (&gt;4 weeks) of the following UC treatments prior to&#xD;
             randomization: 6-mercaptopurine, azathioprine, sulfasalazine or 5-aminosalicylic acid.&#xD;
             Subjects will need to maintain stable doses of these drugs for at least 4 weeks during&#xD;
             study treatment and an additional 7 days of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects treated with oral corticosteroids will be eligible if the dose is ≤20 mg/day&#xD;
             prednisone (≤9 mg/day budesonide) or equivalent. The corticosteroid therapy will have&#xD;
             to be stable for at least 2 weeks prior to the Screening sigmoidoscopy, throughout&#xD;
             study treatment and an additional 7 days of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Colonoscopy within the past 1 year to exclude adenomas, dysplasia, and colon cancer&#xD;
             for subjects with 1/3 of colon involved and 8 years of disease; those without a&#xD;
             colonoscopy in the past year may use the Screening colonoscopy to confirm eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Female subjects must be surgically sterile, postmenopausal (i.e., no menses for at&#xD;
             least 2 years or documented by follicle stimulating hormone), or if of child-bearing&#xD;
             potential must have a negative pregnancy test and must be willing to use a highly&#xD;
             effective form of contraceptive through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. The&#xD;
             following are considered highly effective contraceptives: combined and&#xD;
             progestogen-only hormonal contraception associated with inhibition of ovulation (oral,&#xD;
             intravaginal, transdermal, injectable, implantable), intrauterine&#xD;
             device/hormone-releasing system, bilateral tubal occlusion, vasectomized partner, or&#xD;
             abstinence. Abstinence should only be used as a contraceptive method if it is in line&#xD;
             with the subject's usual and preferred lifestyle. Periodic abstinence (calendar,&#xD;
             symptothermal, post ovulation methods) is not an acceptable method of contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Male subjects must be surgically sterile, abstinent, agree to use an appropriate&#xD;
             contraception method (i.e., condom), or have a female sexual partner who is surgically&#xD;
             sterile, postmenopausal, or using a highly effective form of contraceptive as noted&#xD;
             above through 30 days after the last dose of study drug. Abstinence should only be&#xD;
             used as a contraceptive method if it is in line with the subject's usual and preferred&#xD;
             lifestyle.&#xD;
&#xD;
        General Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any clinically significant disease: renal, hepatic, neurological, cardiovascular,&#xD;
             pulmonary, endocrinology, psychiatric, hematologic, urologic, or other acute or&#xD;
             chronic disease that in the opinion of the Investigator would not make the subject a&#xD;
             suitable candidate for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with planned hospitalization or surgery during the course of the study.&#xD;

             QuantiFERON test). In cases where the QuantiFERON test is indeterminate, the subject&#xD;
             may have the test repeated once and if their second test is negative, they will be&#xD;
             eligible. In the event a second test is also indeterminate, or QuantiFERON is&#xD;
