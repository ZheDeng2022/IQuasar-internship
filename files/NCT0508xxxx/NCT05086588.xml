      This is a prospective, Open-label, comparative clinical study to asses two brilliant blue G&#xD;
      dyes as staining agent in Vitro Retinal Surgery.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed as prospective, open label, comparative observational study. The&#xD;
      patients over 18 years old and undergone Macular Surgery, Internal Limiting membrane removal&#xD;
      surgery or vitreomacular traction using the two brilliant blue G dyes as staining agent in&#xD;
      Vitro Retinal Surgery were planned to enroll the study. Two blue G dyes (Bio Blue 90 plus and&#xD;
      ILM Blue) was randomly assigned at the subject's initial intraoperative visit, according to a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization schedule. During the pars plana vitrectomy, Bio Blue 90 Plus&#xD;
      or ILM Blue dyes were injected into eye to stain ILM. Injected Dye was removed from the eye&#xD;
      at the end of study before injecting long term tamponade. A total of 5 visits were conducted&#xD;
      during the study. Out of them pre-operative visit was done on 1 visit, Surgery/Intraoperative&#xD;
      visit and thereafter there were three follow-up visits. The follow- up visits were performed&#xD;
      at 1 month, 3 months and 6 Months after the completion of Surgery. Clinical evaluation will&#xD;
      be done recording and using staining Ability of ILM (Intra-Operatively), Visualization of&#xD;
      Stained Membrane (Intra-Operatively),OCT parameters: (Pre-Op &amp; Post-Op Follow-Up), FFA&#xD;
      parameters: (Pre-Op &amp; Post-Op Follow-Up),Fundus auto fluorescence (FAF), Multifocal ERG&#xD;
      (Pre-Op &amp; Post-Op Follow-Up) and Visual Field analyses (Pre-Op &amp; Post-Op Follow-Up).&#xD;

    <description>During multifocal ERG testing, the patient views a rapidly changing sequence on the monitor. The resulting electrical activity is recorded by an electrode, then amplified and analyzed. During stimulation the hexagons on the screen independently change every 13 milliseconds. They all follow the same pseudorandom sequence, with each hexagon starting at a slightly different position in this sequence. Using a cross-correlation technique, the software determines the retinal response from each of the 103 segments of the retina.</description>
