  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators seek to assess the efficacy of removing cow's milk from an EoE patient's&#xD;
      diet. This will be determined by esophageal inflammation and clinical and histological&#xD;
      response to the milk elimination treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The dietary approach is based on the hypothesis that food antigen(s) trigger eosinophilic&#xD;
      inflammation and clinical and histological remission can be induced by identifying and&#xD;
      excluding the causative food antigen(s). It is believed that eliminating causative food&#xD;
      antigen(s) target the cause and thus induces long term remission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This process is difficult as it requires multiple, invasive endoscopies and introduces the&#xD;
      possibility of iatrogenic effects such as nutrient deficiency due to simultaneous multiple&#xD;
      food eliminations. In addition, patient compliance may be compromised, both intentionally and&#xD;
      unintentionally as many families report the elimination process to be both confusing and&#xD;
      frustrating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective study eliminating only cow's milk proteins, which are a common cause of&#xD;
      esophageal inflammation in patients with eosinophilic esophagitis, will assess the&#xD;
      histological response in a cohort of children receiving care at Lurie Children's.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients aged 1-18&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who meet the criteria for diagnosis of EoE with â‰¥15 eosinophils per high&#xD;
             power field and who had been previously treated with an adequate dose of PPI for 6-8&#xD;
             weeks or had a normal 24 hour ph probe study will be recruited from the patients seen&#xD;
             by one of the physicians in the EoE clinic at Lurie Children's and other participating&#xD;
             centers&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who agree to cow's milk elimination diet as their treatment of EoE&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who started on oral or swallowed steroids (prior use of steroids that was&#xD;
             discontinued more than two months prior to enrollment does not constitute an exclusion&#xD;
             criterion)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are unable to tolerate the cow's milk elimination diet&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concurrent eosinophilic gastroenteritis or eosinophilic colitis&#xD;
