      This phase I trial tests the safety, side effects, and best dose of CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1 in&#xD;
      treating patients with triple negative breast cancer that has spread to other places in the&#xD;
      body (metastatic). CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1 is an oncolytic virus. This is a virus that is designed&#xD;
      to infect tumor cells and break them down.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety and tolerability of a novel chimeric oncolytic orthopoxvirus,&#xD;
      oncolytic virus CF33-expressing hNIS/Anti-PD-L1 antibody (CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1), by the&#xD;
      evaluation of toxicities including: type, frequency, severity, attribution, time course,&#xD;
      reversibility and duration according to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events&#xD;
      (CTCAE) 5.0 criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the optimal biologic dose (OBD) (defined as a safe dose that induces an&#xD;
      immune response in tumors [increase checkpoint target PD-L1 by at least 5% and/or increase T&#xD;
      cell infiltration by at least 10%]) and the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) for future&#xD;
      expansion trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To determine tumor response rates by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) version (v)1.1 (primary) and immune-modified (i)RECIST (secondary).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To document possible therapeutic efficacy and evaluate progression-free survival,&#xD;
      overall survival and response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the immune and genomic profiles of tumors before and after CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive CF33-hNIS-antiPDL1 intratumorally (IT) on days 1 and 15. Treatment repeats&#xD;
      every 28 days for up to 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, then every 3 months&#xD;
      for 1 year.&#xD;
