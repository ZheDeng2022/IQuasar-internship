  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for Glioblastoma (GBM) patients who will be beginning Optune as part&#xD;
      of their clinical care, which is a novel treatment that utilizes - tumor treating fields&#xD;
      (TTFields), (aka, electrical therapy), which has shown to improve overall survival in large&#xD;
      multi-center trials. As a part of this study, participants will either receive Optune with&#xD;
      &quot;standard array mapping&quot; (based on regular contrast enhanced MRI) or an &quot;alternative (more&#xD;
      precise) array mapping&quot; based on sophisticated state of the art MRI techniques including&#xD;
      &quot;whole brain spectroscopy&quot;. Whole brain MRI spectroscopy provides additional metabolic&#xD;
      information to map out the full extent of tumor spreading within the brain (far beyond from&#xD;
      what is seen on regular MRI), by identifying certain metabolites that are present in cancer&#xD;
      cells versus healthy tissue. This study is being performed to show whether alternative array&#xD;
      mapping improves treatment outcomes, as opposed to the standard array mapping, by maximizing&#xD;
      delivery of TTFields dose, thereby achieving more effective tumor cell killing, decreasing&#xD;
      the rate of local recurrence, and improving the overall survival as well as quality of life&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
