  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open to adults with advanced colorectal cancer or with advanced pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer. The study has 2 parts. In the first part, participants with colorectal cancer get a&#xD;
      medicine called BI 905711 combined with chemotherapy and bevacizumab. The purpose of the&#xD;
      first part is to find the highest BI 905711 dose participants can tolerate. In the second&#xD;
      part, participants with colorectal cancer or pancreatic cancer get BI 905711 combined with&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Some participants also get bevacizumab. The second part tests whether BI 905711&#xD;
      makes tumours shrink. Participants get BI 905711, chemotherapy and bevacizumab about every 2&#xD;
      weeks as an infusion into a vein. Participants can stay in the study as long as they benefit&#xD;
      from treatment and can tolerate it. The doctors regularly check the health of the&#xD;
      participants and note any health problems that could have been caused by the study treatment.&#xD;
      The doctors also monitor the size of the tumour.&#xD;

             safety of the trial drug, such as neurologic, psychiatric, infectious disease or&#xD;
             active ulcers (gastro-intestinal (GI) tract, skin) or laboratory abnormality that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with trial participation or trial drug administration,&#xD;
