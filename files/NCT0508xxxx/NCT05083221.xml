  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hearing impairment in older adults is becoming a common health problem as the population&#xD;
      ages. The impact of hearing impairment in older adults includes not only physical function&#xD;
      and cognitive performance, but also depression, loneliness and social isolation, as well as&#xD;
      having a negative impact on quality of life and financial status. Therefore, an audiological&#xD;
      rehabilitation program intervention is recommended. The purposes of this study are to examine&#xD;
      the effects of an audiological rehabilitation program (Hear-Talk-Activity audiological&#xD;
      rehabilitation program) intervention on communication abilities, depression, loneliness and&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes in older adults with hearing impairment. The single-blind,&#xD;
      randomized control trial will include older adults aged 65 years or older with hearing&#xD;
      impairment and aid user. Participants will be randomized to either intervention groups or&#xD;
      control groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be an experimental design featuring repeated measures, with data collected&#xD;
      from a pretest, a posttest and a follow-up test. An estimated total of 96 participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to experimental and control groups. The experimental group will&#xD;
      participate in a 10-week aural rehabilitation program (Hear-Talk-Activity audiological&#xD;
      rehabilitation program), including provide information, hearing aids and assistive listening&#xD;
      devices, communication strategies and skills, personal coping and adjustment, psychosocial&#xD;
      support and stress management, consisting of 60-minute sessions once per week, while the&#xD;
      control group will be put on a waiting-list group. Each group will be assessed of the&#xD;
      outcomes at 3 time points: baseline (T0), three months following the intervention (T1) and&#xD;
      again at six months following the intervention (T2). The investigators will use the Hearing&#xD;
      Handicap Inventory for the Elderly-Screening version (HHIE-S), the 10-item version of the&#xD;
      Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (10-item CES-D), the short-form&#xD;
      University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Loneliness Scale-8 item (ULS-8) and the Short&#xD;
      Form-12 health survey (SF-12) as the outcome indicators. The principle of intention-to-treat&#xD;
      (ITT) analysis will be used, and the result will be analyzed mainly by generalized estimating&#xD;
      equation (GEE).&#xD;
