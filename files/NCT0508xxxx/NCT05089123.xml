      This trial by its design was a prospective, multicenter, double blind, randomized comparative&#xD;
      clinical trial of the IIIb-IV phase which was carried out in parallel groups of volunteers&#xD;
      over the age of 60&#xD;

      The volunteers will include in the trial will divide into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: volunteers who will receive one dose of Flu-M, solution for intramuscular injection,&#xD;
      0.5 mL, intramuscularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: volunteers who will receive one dose of Ultrix®, solution for intramuscular&#xD;
      administration, 0.5 mL, intramuscularly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial include the following periods and visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Screening period (up to 7 days):&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Visit 0 (day -7...-1).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vaccination period (up to 1 day):&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Visit 1 (day 1, randomization, blood collection for serological examination,&#xD;
           vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Follow-up period (up to 28(+2) days):&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 2 (day 3, organization of trials to assess safety);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 3 (day 7(+1), organization of trials to assess safety);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 4 (day 21(+2), organization of trials to assess safety, blood collection for&#xD;
                serological study);&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 5 (day 28(+2), organization of trials to assess safety, trial completion);&#xD;
