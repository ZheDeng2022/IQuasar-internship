  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is comparing vital signs between standard care and prone position&#xD;
      groups. Standard care will consist of routine clinical care, including any advice to lie in&#xD;
      prone position as routinely recommended by participating sites. For those randomized to prone&#xD;
      position, a special intervention team will visit patients' rooms aiming for patients to&#xD;
      maintain the prone position for at least 8 hours a day.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is a pragmatic open label randomised controlled trial. After being informed about&#xD;
      the study and potential risks, all patients having written informed consents will be&#xD;
      randomised into two groups. Standard care group will consist of routine clinical care,&#xD;
      including any advice to lie in prone position as routinely recommended by participating&#xD;
      sites. To reduce bias, the study team will make visits at a similar schedule to those to&#xD;
      patients in the intervention group, however these visits will be confined to general advice&#xD;
      and measurement of vital signs. Patients will receive written advice more general in nature&#xD;
      about COVID-19 disease. For those randomized to prone position group, a special intervention&#xD;
      team will visit patients' rooms aiming for patients to maintain the prone position for at&#xD;
      least 8 hours a day. The team will give written and verbal advice and if necessary aid&#xD;
      patients' positioning themselves in the prone position. The exact duration of prone sessions&#xD;
      will be determined according to ward schedules to take account of nursing procedures, meal&#xD;
      times and mitigation strategies. Other methods to encourage the maintenance of prone position&#xD;
      includes phone calls to patients, carers or education of carers. Compliance with the&#xD;
      intervention will be evaluated by observation (manual and using in-room cameras) at fixed&#xD;
      time intervals. In a subgroup of 100 patients accelerometer/gyrometer devices will be used to&#xD;
      measure movement and position (this will be expanded to all patients if equipment is&#xD;
      available). Other outcome measures (SpO2, heart rate etc) will be measured using standard&#xD;
      monitoring equipment currently used at study sites, including wearable devices.&#xD;
