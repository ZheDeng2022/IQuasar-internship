  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      All trauma patients receive Lovenox or other prophylactic medication to prevent deep vein&#xD;
      clots from forming. For the trauma patients with orthopedic injuries requiring surgery there&#xD;
      is controversy over safety and efficacy when prophylaxis is started preoperatively vs&#xD;
      postoperatively. This study is to evaluate both approaches for safety in terms of bleeding&#xD;
      events during and 24 hours after surgery as well as preventing deep vein clot formation. This&#xD;
      will be a randomized double blinded study using Lovenox or placebo as the medications given&#xD;
      preoperatively. Postoperative Lovenox will be given to both groups per routine regime.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and Operating Room (OR) of&#xD;
      Valleywise Health Medical Center. The study population will include adult subjects age â‰¥ 18&#xD;
      years of age, that require surgery for management of their traumatic long bone and/or pelvic&#xD;
      fractures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 60 evaluable subjects will be enrolled in this pilot safety study, with a 1:1&#xD;
      randomization into each group. It is anticipated that approximately 70 patients will need to&#xD;
      be consented to reach 60 evaluable subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects recruited for study participation must meet all study enrollment criteria prior to&#xD;
      being enrolled in the study. Patients who meet inclusion / exclusion criteria will be invited&#xD;
      to participate in the study. As feasible, the patient or his/her representative will be&#xD;
      approached for enrollment in the study and asked to provide informed consent for&#xD;
      participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written informed consent will be obtained for all subjects by an investigator or delegate&#xD;
      prior to enrollment in the study. All subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      randomized to either enoxaparin or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for bleeding complications from the time of test article&#xD;
      administration to 24 hours post-surgery. Subjects will be monitored for the development of&#xD;
      DVT and/or PE through-out their hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized to either 30 mg enoxaparin Sub Cutaneous (SQ) of 0.9% Sodium&#xD;
      Chloride (NaCl) placebo SQ. Randomization will be 1:1, using a masked randomization list.&#xD;
      Study personnel and the treatment team will be blinded to the randomization assignment. The&#xD;
      Clinical Research Manager and pharmacy staff will be un-blinded and will not participate in&#xD;
      study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two groups will be treated as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enoxaparin 30mg/0.3ml SQ will be given within 12 hours prior to surgery. If surgery should be&#xD;
      delayed longer than 12 hours following the initial dose a second dose will be given to ensure&#xD;
      uninterrupted dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is already on Lovenox 12 hours prior to surgery, no doses will be skipped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Placebo Group Normal Saline (0.9%) 0.3 ml SQ will be given within 12 hours prior to surgery&#xD;
      If surgery should be delayed longer than 12 hours following the initial dose a second dose of&#xD;
      normal saline will be given to ensure the appearance of uninterrupted dosing in order to&#xD;
      maintain the blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient is already being given Enoxaparin 12 hours prior to surgery, the dose 12 hours&#xD;
      prior to surgery will be substituted with normal saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will receive routine administration of Enoxaparin 12 hours following surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be monitored at 12 hours and 24 hours post procedure for any evidence of deep vein&#xD;
      thrombosis (DVT) or pulmonary embolism (PE) formation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Will be monitored during surgery, at 12 hrs and 24 hrs post-operatively for any bleeding&#xD;
      events. A bleeding event is present if one or more of the following are present:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A drop of 3mg/dl or more in hemoglobin, Transfusion of blood product, Intervention/surgery&#xD;
      for bleeding (hematoma, hemorrhage)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following information will be collected and recorded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographics: name, age, race, ethnicity, height, weight, physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Acute trauma history&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surgical data: procedure, length of surgery, estimated blood loss&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Lab results&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Imaging results&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Bleeding complications&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. DVT and PE events&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Outcome data (length of stay, ICU days, vent days, complications, disposition, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Unanticipated problems&#xD;
