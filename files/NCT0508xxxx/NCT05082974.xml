    <description>OC-01 (varenicline 0.6mg/ml) nasal spray which contains varenicline is being developed by Oyster Point Pharma for the treatment of signs and symptoms of Drye Eye Disease. OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray activates the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway and stimulates natural tear production to bathe the corneal nerve endings in a protective layer of tear film. In addition, OC-01 (varenicline) acts as a cholinergic agonist and may provide analgesia by activating the trigeminal parasympathetic pathway.</description>
