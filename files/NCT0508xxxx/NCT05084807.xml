  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The macro and microscopic findings of the upper gastrointestinal tract are useful in the&#xD;
      differential diagnosis of digestive diseases such as Crohn's or celiac diseases. However, the&#xD;
      histopathological findings (duodenal lymphocytosis, atrophy, chronic inflammatory infiltrate,&#xD;
      etc.) are generally not pathognomonic, and there is a great overlap between different&#xD;
      inflammatory diseases. The study of lymphocyte subpopulations of the intestine has shown its&#xD;
      usefulness in cases of celiac disease that are difficult to diagnose. In patients with celiac&#xD;
      disease, lymphocytes that infiltrate the duodenum present a specific pattern with increased&#xD;
      percentage of TCRgẟ+ lymphocytes and reduced percentage of CD3- lymphocytes. However, it is&#xD;
      currently unknown if other inflammatory diseases (e.g. Crohn's disease) have specific&#xD;
      lymphocyte subpopulations that could be of great diagnostic aid. One of the main problems in&#xD;
      establishing patterns associated with disease is the absence of immunological studies carried&#xD;
      out in healthy individuals. Most of the studies include, as a control group, patients who&#xD;
      undergo gastroscopy for the study of upper digestive symptoms and have microscopically normal&#xD;
      duodenal biopsy. This is a heterogeneous population that includes, among others, patients&#xD;
      with functional pathology in whom the existence of low-grade inflammatory phenomena has been&#xD;
      suggested. Therefore, patients with digestive symptoms are not good controls to establish&#xD;
      normal patterns of intestinal immunity.&#xD;

      Hypothesis: The evaluation of the lymphocyte subpopulations of the subjects without digestive&#xD;
      symptoms and normal upper digestive tract mucosa will allow to have a healthy control group&#xD;
      with which to compare the cellular patterns of different chronic inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
