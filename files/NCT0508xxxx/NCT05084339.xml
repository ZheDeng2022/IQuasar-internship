  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the GLORIA study is to determine whether an altered glucose metabolism (with more&#xD;
      hypoglycaemia and glycaemic variability) and altered metabolomics during pregnancy after&#xD;
      bariatric surgery contribute to the increased risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes such as&#xD;
      small-for-gestational age infants. In addition, the investigators also aim to evaluate&#xD;
      whether continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) can be used to diagnose gestational diabetes&#xD;
      (GDM).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The GLORIA study is a Belgian multicenter prospective cohort study. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      recruit 95 pregnant women after bariatric surgery (gastric bypass or sleeve gastrectomy) and&#xD;
      as a control group, an age and BMI-matched cohort of 95 pregnant women without bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Participants will be recruited before 12 weeks of pregnancy. To evaluate glucose&#xD;
      homeostasis, a masked CGM will be used for 10 days during each trimester in pregnancy and at&#xD;
      the time of screening for GDM (at 24-28 weeks). The primary outcome is the mean glycaemia&#xD;
      levels and glycaemic variability (SD) measured by CGM in pregnancy. At the different time&#xD;
      points, anthropometric measurements (including body composition), food diary, questionnaires&#xD;
      and micronutrients will be evaluated. In addition, in collaboration with the lab of Cristina&#xD;
      Legido Quigle from the Steno Diabetes Center in Copenhagen, metabolomics will be analyzed.&#xD;
      Women with a history of bariatric surgery will receive screening for GDM between 24-28 weeks&#xD;
      of pregnancy by performing self- monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) with a glucometer during&#xD;
      one week. In addition to SMBG, women will receive a masked CGM during one week.&#xD;
