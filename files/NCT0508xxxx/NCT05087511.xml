      This thesis was planned to examine the effects of risk factors seen with a history of preterm&#xD;
      birth on sensory and motor development in preschool children. A total of 48 children, 24 with&#xD;
      only a history of preterm birth and 24 with additional risk factors for preterm birth, were&#xD;

      This thesis was planned to examine the effects of risk factors seen with a history of preterm&#xD;
      birth on sensory and motor development in preschool children. A total of 48 children, 24 with&#xD;
      only a history of preterm birth and 24 with additional risk factors for preterm birth, were&#xD;
      included in the study. Additional risk factors, including respiratory distress syndrome,&#xD;
      intraventricular bleeding, periventricular leukomalacia, necrotizing enterocolitis,&#xD;
      retinopathy of prematurity, and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, which are common in preterm&#xD;
      infants, were recorded. Peabody Motor Development Scale-2 was used to evaluate motor&#xD;
      development performances and Dunn Sensory Profile was used to evaluate sensory processing.&#xD;

    <description>Peabody Motor Development Scale-2 was first developed in 1983 by Rhonda Folio and Rebecca Fewell. A second edition was published by the same authors in 2000. Offering separate tests and rating scales for both gross and fine motor skills, it is a frequently preferred tool for assessing the motor development of young children from birth to 72 months. The duration of the test is 45-60 minutes. Gross and fine motor assessments can be done on the same day or at different times. It is important to know the age of the child before starting the assessment and corrected age up to 2 years of age is used in preterm children. Each item is evaluated according to a 3-point (0,1,2) scoring scale. The therapist asks the child to do a certain item and observes how the child does the activity. Items are scored as 2, 1, or 0. Higher scores perform better.</description>

    <description>The Dunn sensory profile is a questionnaire filled out by a parent or primary caregiver that assesses children's reactions to events and sensory situations they encounter in daily life. The Dunn Sensory profile is suitable for assessing sensory development in children aged 3-10 years. The questionnaire consists of 125 items and the parent evaluates the event defined in each item according to the child's situation. For each of the 125 items, the parent was asked to respond on a five-point Likert scale of 1 = always, 2 = often, 3 = sometimes, 4 = rarely, and 5 = never. Higher scores perform better.</description>

    <description>Infant/toddler sensory profile (Dunn sensory profile 7-36) is a parent or caregiver questionnaire that evaluates the responses of children up to 3 years of age to sensory inputs. It was revised and updated as Dunn sensory profile II in 2014. BYDP has forms that evaluate two different age groups, 0-6 months and 7-36 months. It has items in six different sections: general, visual, auditory, vestibular, tactile, and oral. Parents evaluate their child's response to sensory stimuli on a 5-point Likert scale. 'Almost never' five; 'almost always' is rated as one. A higher score indicates that the behavior is observed less frequently. In addition to the total score, the items of the test provide score formation in four quadrants: low registration, sensory sensitivity, sensory avoidance, and sensory seeking.</description>
