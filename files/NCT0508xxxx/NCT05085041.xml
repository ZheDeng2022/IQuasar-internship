  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research proposal will be an 8-week randomized control trial (RCT) to examine the&#xD;
      efficacy of an eHealth intervention, namely Healthy Parental Online Education (HOPE), on&#xD;
      fruit and vegetable intake and active playtime among toddlers enrolled in early head start&#xD;
      programs in Lubbock, Texas. Parents with toddlers ages one to three years will be recruited&#xD;
      from Early Head Start centers. Written consent forms will be obtained before baseline data&#xD;
      collection. The participants will be then randomly assigned to the intervention or control&#xD;
      group. The participants in the intervention group will receive a multi-component online&#xD;
      nutrition intervention for eight weeks. While the control group will receive a copy of the&#xD;
      booklet that includes the 2020 U.S. Department of Agriculture Dietary Guidelines (USDA) for&#xD;
      toddlers and adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure sociodemographic, parental nutritional knowledge, parental&#xD;
      attitude related to healthy eating, parental self-efficacy, parental feeding practices,&#xD;
      carotenoids in the skin of both parents and toddlers, three-day food photos, and physical&#xD;
      activity and sedentary times of toddlers. This research proposal hypothesizes that there will&#xD;
      be significant differences in fruit and vegetable intake and physically active time among&#xD;
      toddlers between the intervention and control group from baseline to 3 months. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that there will be significant differences in parental&#xD;
      nutrition knowledge, attitude, self-efficacy, and feeding practice between the intervention&#xD;
      and control group from baseline to 3 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The investigators will examine the efficacy of an eHealth intervention, namely Healthy&#xD;
      Parental Online Education (HOPE), to increase fruit and vegetable intake and active playtime&#xD;
      among toddlers enrolled in Early Head Start programs in Lubbock. This study will be an 8-week&#xD;
      randomized control trial (RCT). Participants will be randomly assigned to the intervention or&#xD;
      control group via block randomization with randomly selected block sizes of 4. Randomization&#xD;
      will be conducted by a researcher not involved in data management. The statistical software R&#xD;
      version 3.5.1 will be used to determine to generate randomized arm allocation sequences&#xD;
      through a fixed seed. The randomization will be stratified by centers. Those allocation&#xD;
      sequences will be printed out and individually stored in serially numbered, opaque, sealed&#xD;
      envelopes. Participants will be informed of group allocation via opaque and sealed envelopes&#xD;
      after the collection of baseline data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in the intervention group will receive 8 sessions of online multi-component HOPE&#xD;
      nutrition intervention. While the control group will receive no intervention, the&#xD;
      investigators will provide the control group with a copy of the booklet. This booklet will&#xD;
      include basic nutrition recommendations for a healthy diet for adults and children,&#xD;
      consistent with 2020 U.S. Department of Agriculture dietary guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre- and post-assessment will be conducted to see changes in variables of interest from&#xD;
      baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2), to 3 months (T3). Sociodemographic and anthropometrics&#xD;
      of parents and toddlers will be measured at T1. The investigators will also measure&#xD;
      carotenoids in the skin of both parents and children using the Veggie Meter (Longevity Link,&#xD;
      Salt Lake City, UT) to assess fruit and vegetable intake. Parental nutritional knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes related to healthy eating and activity, feeding practices, and self-efficacy will&#xD;
      be assessed using a self-administered questionnaire. The research team will also ask parents&#xD;
      to recall the physical activity and sedentary times of toddlers using a self-report survey.&#xD;
      Parents will take electronic food photos using their mobile devices for three days to capture&#xD;
      the food and beverage intake of toddlers at home. The same measurements and survey will be&#xD;
      used at T2 except for variables related to anthropometrics and sociodemographics. Finally,&#xD;
      the investigators will only measure the food intake of toddlers, physically active and&#xD;
      sedentary times of toddlers, and carotenoid levels of parents and toddlers at T3, using the&#xD;
      same methods and procedures mentioned above.&#xD;

    <description>The participants in this group will receive 8 sessions of a multi-component online education intervention. The education curriculum will be focused on addressing evidence-based healthy habits that are related to preventing childhood obesity: more vegetables and fruits, less screen time, and more physical activity. Topics may include age-appropriate nutrition and eating, picky eating, positive parental feeding practices, active playtime, and screen time. Strategies for eating healthy on a budget will be also provided to the participants.&#xD;
The intervention will incorporate multi-component as follow: instructional YouTube videos, online cooking activities, reminder text messages with key information, and telephone consultation. Each session will include a lifestyle component regarding eating, feeding, and physical activity, aimed at equipping parents with knowledge and skills to improve fruit and vegetable intake and physical activity levels of young children.</description>

    <description>The participants in the control group will receive no intervention. However, the investigators will provide the control group with a copy of the booklet that includes 2020 USDA dietary guidelines for a healthy diet for young children. This will enable the investigators to see if the multi-component education intervention (stated above) is more effective on behavior changes than the written booklet in the control group.</description>

    <intervention_name>Multi-Component eHealth Intervention, namely Healthy Online Parental Education (HOPE)</intervention_name>
    <description>The investigators will provide 8 sessions of a multi-component education intervention to the participants in the intervention group. Each session will address parental nutrition knowledge, self-efficacy, and attitudes around feeding, parental modeling of healthy foods, and skill development to increase success in making behavioral changes. The intervention curriculum will be informed by Social Cognitive Theory to help parents guide young children to engage in healthy eating behaviors through modeling (Curriculum Design). The investigators will deliver the intervention using multicomponent to enhance and maximize the learning experiences of the participants for successful behavior changes. The intervention will be comprised of instructional videos, text messages with key information, online cooking activities, and telephone consultation (Modality).</description>
