  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Prior to surgical intervention, the conservative treatment of knee osteoarthritis involves&#xD;
      analgesia and intra-articular injections and currently only steroid injections are available&#xD;
      as part of NHS treatment. They have short-term benefit only (&lt;6months) and potentially have&#xD;
      detrimental effects on residual cartilage. Arthrosamid is a hydrogel consisting of 97.5%&#xD;
      sterile water and 2.5% cross-linked polyacrylamide. It's been shown to be safe and effective,&#xD;
      with benefits lasting beyond 2 years in the majority. However, currently it is unclear via&#xD;
      what biological pathways it reduces joint inflammation and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will investigate the effects of Arthrosamid clinically and biologically.&#xD;

      Prior to surgical intervention, the conservative treatment of knee osteoarthritis involves&#xD;
      analgesia and intra-articular injections. Currently only steroid injections are available as&#xD;
      part of NHS treatment. It is recognised they have short-term benefit only (&lt;6months) and&#xD;
      potentially have detrimental effects on residual cartilage. Arthrosamid is a hydrogel&#xD;
      consisting of 97.5% sterile water and 2.5% cross-linked polyacrylamide. It's been shown to be&#xD;
      safe and effective, with benefits lasting beyond 2 years in the majority. However, currently&#xD;
      it is unclear via what biological pathways it reduces joint inflammation and pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with osteoarthritis who are offered an intra-articular knee injection as part of&#xD;
      standard care will be asked to enter the trial. On entering the trial baseline outcome&#xD;
      measures will be recorded. The level of knee pain will be evaluated using Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale (VAS). Patients will also be asked to complete the Knee injury and Osteoarthritis&#xD;
      Outcome Score (KOOS) score and Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index&#xD;
      (WOMAC). Patients will also declare the quantity of anti-inflammatory drugs and Oral&#xD;
      analgesia that they have consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of treatment, a blood sample will be taken and under sterile conditions, synovial&#xD;
      fluid will be aspirated from the knee prior to 6mls of Arthrosamid being injected. Patients&#xD;
      will be reviewed by a researcher in a dedicated research clinic at 3,6 and 12 months post&#xD;
      injection and the outcome measures repeated. At 3 months post injection synovial fluid and&#xD;
      blood will again be collected from the patients. The blood and synovial fluid pre and post&#xD;
      injection in patients who respond well to the injection will be compared to the samples from&#xD;
      patients who fail to respond. The differences between the biochemical environments will allow&#xD;
      us to identify likely pathways by which the injection reduces pain and inflammation.&#xD;
