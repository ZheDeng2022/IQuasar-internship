    <textblock>
      Patients aged between 16 and 35 years with indication for surgical removal of impacted lower&#xD;
      third molar will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive FDC oxycodone 5 mg/ibuprofen 400 mg&#xD;
      from Eurofarma Laboratórios SA (experimental drug) or FDC codeine 30 mg/paracetamol 500 mg&#xD;
      (Tylex® - Janssen-Cilag Farmacêutica Ltda.) as tablets, for up to three (03) days.&#xD;
      Participants whose surgery lasts no more than 40 minutes (starting from the initial incision&#xD;
      to the extraction of impacted third molar) and who experience post-surgical pain that is&#xD;
      moderate to intense in intensity up to four (04) hours after the surgery ends will be&#xD;
      randomized. The first administration of the study treatment will be performed at the clinical&#xD;
      investigation site when post-surgical pain reaches moderate/intense intensity (≥ 40 mm on a&#xD;
      0-100 mm Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be instructed to, from then on, use the study treatment as needed for pain&#xD;
      relief, observing a minimum interval of six (06) hours between two intakes, for up to three&#xD;
      (03) days (72 hours after the initial dose).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who meet all of the eligibility criteria will be randomized to one of the following&#xD;
      treatment groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: FDC oxycodone 5 mg/ibuprofen 400 mg from Eurofarma Laboratórios SA (experimental&#xD;
      drug) - Participants randomized to this group will receive one (01) tablet of the&#xD;
      experimental drug + one (01) tablet of Tylex® placebo when post-surgical pain intensity&#xD;
      reaches moderate to intense intensity (≥ 40 mm on a 0-100 mm VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Tylex® (codeine 30 mg/paracetamol 500 mg) - Participants randomized to this group&#xD;
      will receive one (01) Tylex® tablet (codeine 30 mg/paracetamol 500 mg) + one (01) tablet of&#xD;
      FCD placebo when post-surgical pain intensity reaches moderate to intense intensity (≥ 40 mm&#xD;
      on a 0-100 mm VAS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will be allowed to use the rescue medication if necessary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paracetamol 500 mg (Tylenol® 500 mg).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects must have three (3) on-site visits at the research site. Three (3) phone calls&#xD;
      will take place between the on-site visits: Screening visit (Vs), randomization visit (Vr),&#xD;
      first phone call (CT1), second phone call (CT2), third phone call (CT3), final visit (Vf).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period for enrolling participants in the study will begin after the necessary ethical and&#xD;
      regulatory approvals and will have an estimated duration of up to 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The approximate duration of the study will be 16 ± 2 days for each participant.&#xD;

    <description>After the administration of the first dose of study treatment, participants will assess pain relief using the 5-point categorical scale (0 = no relief, 1 = little relief, 2 = some relief, 3 = a lot of relief, 4 = complete relief) in one-hour intervals (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 h). The sum of pain relief scores within 6 hours determines TOTPAR6, which ranges from 0 to 24, and the higher the value, the greater the pain relief.</description>
