  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Stroke is a clinical picture that develops due to occlusion or rupture of cerebral vessels&#xD;
      and results in loss of cerebral functions. Stroke individuals face some limitations in&#xD;
      managing daily activities such as walking, dressing, feeding and showering. Personal,&#xD;
      environmental, and societal limitations have led to the development of new treatment&#xD;
      strategies, such as telerehabilitation(TR), to meet the needs of stroke individuals and their&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients will be randomized and divided into 2 groups in order to examine the&#xD;
      effects of two different TR methods on physical parameters and activities of daily living in&#xD;
      stroke patients. Baseline assessments will be made for both groups to determine&#xD;
      functionality, activities of daily living, fall activity, quality of life, and level of&#xD;
      fatigue. For 8 weeks, the TR group will do their exercises with exercise videos prepared on&#xD;
      the system 3 times a week. The control group, on the other hand, will do their exercises with&#xD;
      exercise brochures on the system 3 times a week for 8 weeks. After 8 weeks, assessments will&#xD;
      be repeated. With telerehabilitation to be applied to individuals with stroke, it is aimed to&#xD;
      increase functional capacity, independence in daily living activities and quality of life,&#xD;
      and reduce the number of falls and fatigue levels.&#xD;
