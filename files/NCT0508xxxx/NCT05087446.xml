  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Loss of function and incapacity for work as a result of mental disorders are increasing,&#xD;
      especially among young people (under 30 years of age), even though the prevalence of mental&#xD;
      illness is fairly stable. Many of the patients referred to outpatient mental health care have&#xD;
      complex difficulties with both mental and somatic ailments, in addition to difficulties with&#xD;
      social conditions related to, for example, education, work, finances and social support.&#xD;
      Functional difficulties can come as a result of mental illness. However, it can also be the&#xD;
      opposite way; not functioning at work, study or daily life in general can cause mental&#xD;
      symptoms and ailments. Many of these people are referred to mental health care even if the&#xD;
      basic problem cannot be solved by psychotherapy or medication. Some of the referred patients&#xD;
      do not have a psychiatric illness, but a reaction to a stressful and demanding situation and&#xD;
      strains over time. Compound health challenges require individualized assessments and&#xD;
      clarifications in order to offer the right measures. Traditionally in mental health care, the&#xD;
      patient is placed on a waiting list to receive assessment and therapy for a specific&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this background, the investigators believe it is important to early identify the&#xD;
      referred patients who will benefit from measures other than traditional assessment and&#xD;
      treatment in mental health care. Knowledge of other aid agencies is important to find the&#xD;
      right measures at the right time. This is important for the individual patients, who are&#xD;
      often young people going to &quot;get started in life&quot;. It is also important for the health&#xD;
      services because the capacity to provide a good health service is a limited resource. From a&#xD;
      societal perspective it is important that the health care offered contributes to reducing&#xD;
      social security dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this randomized, controlled trial is to compare the effect of traditional&#xD;
      management of newly referred patients in outpatient clinics with assessment through an Early&#xD;
      Assessment Team. The investigators believe that early assessment may have a positive effect&#xD;
      on mental health, quality of life and function. The outcome goals can be summarized as less&#xD;
      use of resources in outpatient clinics and society and better function and life for patients.&#xD;

    <description>Early assessment team (EAT):The patients receive their first assessment by an early clarification team within a few weeks after the team receiving the referral. The team then decides whether further assessment and/or treatment should be given in the general outpatient clinic, and/or whether any other follow-up may be appropriate. In the first meeting the patient preferably meets two therapists, who conduct a semi-structured interview with focus on health and level of functioning. If considered appropriate, the team may offer a short-term intervention.</description>

    <intervention_name>Admission to General psychiatric outpatient clinic</intervention_name>
    <description>Ordinary procedures for admission to an outpatient clinic are followed in accordance with the Norwegian Directorate of Health's national prioritization guide. Referrals are assessed on the basis of severity and placed on a regular waiting list (usually a waiting period of 1-3 months). The patients receive their first personal assessment from a therapist in a general outpatient clinic who takes a position on what is to be initiated and, if necessary, offers further assessment / treatment in accordance with procedures in the outpatient clinics. This is not standardized beyond current practice.</description>
