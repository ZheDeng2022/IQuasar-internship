    <textblock>
      Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has caused pandemic since&#xD;
      outbreak in 2020. Patients with HIV may be at higher risk than those without HIV for&#xD;
      coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). At present, limited data are available on the safety and&#xD;
      immunogenicity of coronavirus vaccine for patients with HIV.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective, single-arm, open-label clinical trial. A total of 200 patients&#xD;
      with HIV infection were included in this vaccination study. All of the patients will further&#xD;
      accept 12 months follow-up study after vaccination. Safety and immunogenicity will be&#xD;
      carefully recorded and detected.&#xD;
