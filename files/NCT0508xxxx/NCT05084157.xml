  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Takotsubo syndrome (TTS) is characterized by severe left ventricular (LV) dysfunction that&#xD;
      gradually recovers, thus leading to the commonly accepted belief that it is a transient and&#xD;
      self-limiting condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histologically, TTS can be accompanied by severe morphological alterations potentially&#xD;
      resulting from catecholamine excess followed by microcirculatory dysfunction and direct&#xD;
      cardiotoxicity. The affected myocardium, however, has a high potential of structural&#xD;
      reconstitution which correlates with the rapid functional recovery. The lack of persistent&#xD;
      morphological changes in TTS has been confirmed by original CMR studies which pointed out&#xD;
      that the acute phase of the disease is characterized only by remarkable myocardial edema with&#xD;
      no evidence of significant late gadolinium enhancement. Indeed, the absence of LGE in TTS&#xD;
      patients has become a common diagnostic criterion in most CMR centers. Although some studies&#xD;
      have challenged this notion by reporting delayed hyper-enhancement in TTS patients, the&#xD;
      intensity and extent of LGE in the acute phase of TTS are less than usually reported in&#xD;
      studies of myocardial infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term clinical and functional consequences of an acute episode of TTS are still&#xD;
      unclear. A recent spectroscopic investigation has shown that long-term (&gt;1 year)&#xD;
      abnormalities in cardiac energetic persist after an acute episode of TTS. Also, a few&#xD;
      patients with residual wall motion abnormality in whom LGE fails to resolve (suggesting the&#xD;
      acute event resulted in frank infarction) have been reported. However, how often persistent&#xD;
      morphologic abnormalities are present after the index episode remains undefined. The&#xD;
      possibility exists that fibrosis was undetected at follow-up CMR studies using conventional&#xD;
      LGE threshold methods due to the fact that myocardial injury is subtler and there are no&#xD;
      confidently recognizable reference regions of normal myocardium. Newer CMR protocols have now&#xD;
      the potential to improve the sensitivity of CMR tissue characterization, especially when&#xD;
      'patchy' fibrosis is present (as it is likely the case of TTS).&#xD;

      Objective of the study The aim of this study is to assess the frequency of long-term (&gt;12&#xD;
      months) morphologic abnormalities at cardiac imaging (e.g. echocardiography and CMR) after an&#xD;
      index episode of TTS, and their possible correlation with presenting features and long-term&#xD;
      outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The registry will enrol consecutive patients with TS who have undergone CMR&#xD;
      either at entry and during follow-up (&gt;12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Registry Design This is a non-interventional, multi-centre, registry of male and female&#xD;
      patients with TTS who undergo follow-up CMR after the index event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale This large global registry focuses on long-term findings in TTS patients. The&#xD;
      registry is observational, and decisions on patient management are determined by the health&#xD;
      care professional and the patient and not by the protocol. Patients are therefore treated&#xD;
      according to normal local practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Source Data: Data will be derived from the patients clinical records according to&#xD;
      specifications outlined in the electronic case report form. This Registry will not undertake&#xD;
      any experimental intervention with patients being treated according to normal local practice.&#xD;
      No additional tests or procedures are required by the protocol. Physicians involved in&#xD;
      initial diagnosis of TTS in patients may transfer or refer the cases to other physicians who&#xD;
      will treat and follow up the patients in the long-term.&#xD;
