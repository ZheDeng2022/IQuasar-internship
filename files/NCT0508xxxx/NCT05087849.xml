      This study will investigate whether injecting genital warts with small quantities of the&#xD;
      Gardasil 9 vaccine has an effect on the warts.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, proof-of-concept research study to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of intralesional nonavalent in the treatment of patients with genital&#xD;
      condylomata. The study will be conducted at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital. The&#xD;
      planned intervention is to provide 10 subjects with at least 3 genital condylomata with&#xD;
      intralesional nonavalent human papillomavirus vaccine (Gardasil 9) at 0 and 4 weeks. Then,&#xD;
      the study subjects will be followed for a further 8 weeks to monitor for change in wart size&#xD;
      and wart number.&#xD;

    <time_frame>to be measured at baseline (week 0) and week 12</time_frame>
    <description>Established tool to measure quality of life with respect to condyloma. Will be administered at baseline and week 12 by study personnel. It comprises 10 items and 2 dimensions. The emotional dimension includes 6 items and the sexual activity dimension includes 4 items. The questions refer to the past 7 days. The higher the score the better the quality of life. The global scoring range was 10-50, ranging from 6 to 30 in the emotional dimensions and from 4 to 20 in the sexual activity dimension.</description>

    <description>Established tool to measure quality of life with any dermatologic disease. Will be administered at baseline and week 12 by study personnel. Consists of 10 questions scored from 0-3. The DLQI is calculated by adding the score of each question, resulting in a maximum of 30 and a minimum of 0. The higher the score, the more quality of life is impaired.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients of all genders aged â‰¥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed clinical diagnosis of genital condylomata with minimum of 3 genital&#xD;
             condylomata, each measuring &gt;3mm&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals who are able to become pregnant will be advised on the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        All individuals who are able to become pregnant will be asked about their reproductive&#xD;
        health, sexual activity (partners, practices, prevention of pregnancy) and be advised that&#xD;
        administration of vaccine during pregnancy is not recommended while data collection to&#xD;
        monitor pregnancy and infant outcomes following exposure to the papillomavirus (9-valent)&#xD;
        vaccine is ongoing. However, based on available data, an increased risk of adverse&#xD;
        pregnancy outcomes, specifically miscarriage or congenital anomalies, has not been observed&#xD;
        following inadvertent administration of the papillomavirus vaccine during pregnancy.&#xD;
        Individuals who are able to become pregnant are advised to contact us immediately and will&#xD;
        not receive any further intralesional vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be asked about pregnancy at time of recruitments. Individuals who&#xD;
             are pregnant or are planning to become pregnant will not be permitted to participate&#xD;
             in the study, as ACOG does not recommend Gardasil 9 during pregnancy. Participants&#xD;
             will be encouraged not to participate in the study if they believe they may become&#xD;
             pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants will be asked about allergic reaction to yeast and vaccine components at&#xD;
             time of recruitment. Subjects with severe allergic reactions to baker's yeast&#xD;
             (Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a vaccine component), or other vaccine components (ie&#xD;
             polysorbate 80, Merck amorphous aluminum hydroxyphosphate sulfate) will not be&#xD;
             permitted to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants' vaccination history will be reviewed at time of recruitment. Patients&#xD;
             who have previously received any prior human papillomavirus vaccine will not be&#xD;
             permitted to participate in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects' medical history and current medications will be reviewed at time of&#xD;
             recruitment. Subjects taking immune suppressive medications (steroids such as&#xD;
             prednisone or dexamethasone, immunosuppressive agents such as methotrexate,&#xD;
             azathioprine, cyclosporine, immunomodulatory agents such as apremilast, or&#xD;
             immunomodulatory biologic agents such as adalimumab, guselkumab or ustekinumab) will&#xD;
             be excluded. Subjects with medical conditions that significantly alter the immune&#xD;
             system, such as known HIV infection, leukemia or lymphoma will be excluded from this&#xD;
             pilot study.&#xD;
