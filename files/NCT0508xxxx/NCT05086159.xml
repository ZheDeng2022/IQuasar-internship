    <textblock>
      This trial compared traditional pain and stress education plus physical therapy to pain&#xD;
      neuroscience education plus physical therapy in individuals with post-traumatic stress and&#xD;
      chronic low back pain.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Veterans and Service Members with low back pain (LBP) will be recruited for this research.&#xD;
      Once Veterans consent to participate in this research, participants will undergo baseline&#xD;
      testing. Next, participants will randomly be assigned to one of two types of education: pain&#xD;
      neuroscience education or traditional biomedical education. Each Veteran will receive 30&#xD;
      minutes of interactive education once a week for 4 weeks, depending on their group&#xD;
      assignment. Following each education session, Veterans will participate in an exercise class&#xD;
      that will last approximately 30 minutes. After the 4 week intervention, Veterans will&#xD;
      complete the same questionnaires and measures as at the beginning of the program. Veterans&#xD;
      will also complete subjective questionnaires at 8 weeks. Finally, healthcare utilization will&#xD;
      be measured for 12 months following the research intervention.&#xD;

    <description>The Brief Survey of Pain Attitudes (SOPA-35) is a valid, reliable, and sensitive questionnaire that measures beliefs about pain across 7 domains. This study was particularly interested in the harm sub-scale to assess whether patient's beliefs that pain means harm changes after the intervention. Each domain is scored from 0-4 with 0 representing &quot;very untrue&quot; and 4 representing &quot;very true.&quot; A higher score for the SOPA-Harm subscale indicates that participants believe that pain is a sign of harm and damage to a greater degree than participants with a lower score on the scale.</description>

    <measure>Lumbar Spine Pain Pressure Threshold (PPT)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>Patients were tested in the prone position with a pillow under their shins to achieve approximately 15 degrees of knee flexion. A research physical therapist applies a digital algometer probe (SBMEDIC Electronics, Sweden) with a gradual increase in force 5 cm lateral to the spinous process of L3 of the most symptomatic side until the participant reported the pressure as painful and pressed a button attached to the algometer. This procedure was performed three times at the low back and averaged to determine the patient's Pain Pressure Threshold with approximately 30 seconds rest between repetitions. Forces are measured in kPA with higher numbers indicating a greater tolerance for pressure and potentially less pain sensitivity.</description>

This program will consist of a 5-10-minute cardiovascular warm-up of walking in place or riding an exercise bike. Next is a 15-minute circuit consisting of 10 different general exercises for 1-minute each. Finally, a 5-minute cool down will consist of light stretching and trunk range of motion exercises. Each exercise will be tailored as easy, medium, or hard depending on the individual patient's tolerance. This program has been shown to be equally as effective as motor control exercises for long-term outcomes in patients with non-specific LBP.</description>
