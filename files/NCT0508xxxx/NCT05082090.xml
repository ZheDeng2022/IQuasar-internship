  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This protocol is designed to study Orthofix regulatory approved and commercially available&#xD;
      spine devices to generate Real World Evidence (RWE) of device safety and performance in the&#xD;
      treatment of patients with spine injuries and/or disorders following the local medical&#xD;
      standard of care. The clinical data generated from this study will support compliance to&#xD;
      global regulatory requirements including but not limited to the European Medical Device&#xD;
      Regulation (EU MDR) for the applicable devices.&#xD;

    <measure>Primary Effectiveness Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Intra-operative to up to 10-years Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in pain measured with Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) or Numeric Rating Scale (NRS): NRS is an 11-point scale for patient self-reporting of pain. Patients rate their current pain intensity at the time of the visit from 0 (&quot;no pain&quot;) to 10 (&quot;worst possible pain&quot;) by selecting a number on a horizontal bar. NRS scores for the evaluation of pain have been categorized as mild (1-3), moderate (4-6), or severe (7-10). VAS scores are recorded by making a handwritten mark on a 10-cm line that represents a continuum between &quot;no pain&quot; and &quot;worst pain.&quot;</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Primary Effectiveness Assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Intra-operative to up to 10-years Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>Improvement in function as measured with Neck Disability Index (NDI) or Oswestry Disability Index (ODI).&#xD;
NDI includes 4 items that relate to subjective symptomatology (pain severity, headache, concentration, sleeping) and 6 items that relate to activities of daily living (lifting, work, driving, recreation, personal care, reading). Each item is scored from 0 to 5, with higher scores corresponding to greater disability. A total NDI score is determined by adding the scores of the individual questions and dividing that total by the maximum possible score (i.e., 50 if all questions are answered) to yield a percentage. Therefore, the NDI score ranges from 0 to 100. The ODI was developed as a specific outcomes tool for subjects suffering from back pain. The questionnaire scores 10 aspects of the subject's home and work life and analgesic use. The disability index is then calculated as a percentage with a high percentage indicating a high level of disability.</description>

    <measure>Secondary Effectiveness Assessments: Quality of Life assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-Operative to up to 10-years Post-Operative</time_frame>
    <description>Quality of Life score measured utilizing PROMIS-29 PROMIS®-29 Profile v2. PROMIS (Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System) is a set of person-centered measures that evaluates and monitors physical, mental, and social health in adults and children. It can be used with the general population and with individuals living with chronic conditions. This instrument is comprised of 8 constructs: Physical Function; Anxiety; Depression; Fatigue; Sleep Disturbance; Ability to Participate in Social Roles and Activities; Pain Interference; and Pain Intensity that closely evaluate the impact of a patient's health on their quality of life</description>
