      WHO recommend to divide AR into 4 subgroups according to the symptom frequency (intermittent&#xD;
      or persistent) and severity (mild or moderate-to-severe). For the persistent&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe AR subgroup, the guideline suggests to treat with intranasal&#xD;
      corticosteroid (INS) plus antihistamines (AH1) for 2-4 weeks. If the symptom is controlled&#xD;
      then degrade the treatment (usually with INS) and maintenance for more than 4 weeks. However,&#xD;
      up to 70% of patients suffering from AR do not follow treatment recommendation, they stopped&#xD;
      medication when they feel better. This behavior always leads to uncontrolled AR, which has&#xD;
      been identified as a high-risk factor of induction and exacerbation of asthma and chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis. A recent survey showed that AR patients prefer to an on-demand treatment&#xD;
      rather than continuous treatment. In general, poor adherence is always a considerable issue&#xD;
      for all long-term treatments. Previous studies have shown that as dosing frequency increases,&#xD;
      the adherence rate decreases. Thus, less medication frequency is an important factor to&#xD;
      optimize the management of chronic diseases including AR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intranasal AH1 can relieve AR symptoms including sneezing, rhinorrhea and nasal itching in 3&#xD;
      to 5 minutes, while INS can inhibit the underlying mucous allergic inflammation and is&#xD;
      recommended as the first-line medication for moderate-to-severe AR. INS combined AH1 have&#xD;
      shown a synergic effect on control AR inflammation and provide rapid AR symptom relief.&#xD;
      Investigators hypothesis that the on-demand administration of INS combined AH1 can achieve&#xD;
      similar AR control level with less dosing frequency as compared to the daily INS maintenance&#xD;
      in controlled moderate-to-severe AR patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background/Significance The prevalence of AR is increasing worldwide. A large number of&#xD;
      studies have shown that AR has a significant adverse impact on the quality of life especially&#xD;
      in the moderate-to-severe AR population. However, as AR is not a fatal disease, only a small&#xD;
      proportion of AR patients will go to hospital to seek professional medical advice. They have&#xD;
      a tendency to do so only when their AR-related symptoms become intolerable, which led to a&#xD;
      dramatic low level of AR control. It is well known that uncontrolled AR has been identified&#xD;
      as a high-risk factor of exacerbation of asthma and chronic rhinosinusitis. In AR patients,&#xD;
      40% will develop asthma and up to 30% will develop chronic sinusitis. Adequate treatment of&#xD;
      AR always help to improve patients' quality of life and also reduce the risk of AR related&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To achieve the goal of AR control, long-term treatment is always needed. AR is an&#xD;
      IgE-mediated inflammatory disease induced by allergen exposure. Our previous study had shown&#xD;
      that more than 90% of AR patients in central China were induced by house dust mite (HDM), a&#xD;
      perennial indoor allergen. HDM exposure leads to persistent allergic inflammation in nasal&#xD;
      mucous and causes periodic exacerbation of AR symptoms. INS is currently the cornerstone&#xD;
      medication to inhibit the allergic inflammation and is recommended as the first-line&#xD;
      medication for moderate-to-severe AR. However, the anti-inflammation effect can only be&#xD;
      achieved after administrate for several days to two weeks. For this reason, the ARIA&#xD;
      guideline suggests to use INS regularly for 2-4 weeks, then step down gradually. In another&#xD;
      side, antihistamine belongs to symptom-relief medication, which has been proven to act within&#xD;
      5min for nasal spray and 30min for oral route. Antihistamine is also recommended as&#xD;
      first-line medication for mild AR patients and combined with INS for moderate-to-severe AR&#xD;
      patients. Our previous studies had shown that if AR patients were treated according to the&#xD;
      current guideline for 15 days, only 72.3% of them were controlled. However, if the treatment&#xD;
      extended to 60 days, more than 95% would achieve AR controlled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low adherence is always a considerable issue for long-term treatment. In asthma patients,&#xD;
      more than 80% of patients taken β2 agonist as needed to relieve their symptom instead of&#xD;
      daily using inhalant corticosteroids. For AR, the adherence to treatment recommendation was&#xD;
      below 30% in the real world. Most AR patients wouldn't take their medication continuously for&#xD;
      14 days as they usually suffered from several episodes of short-term AR symptoms. They have a&#xD;
      strong preference for a treatment which can provide both a rapid onset of action and&#xD;
      clinically-relevant symptom relief.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators will compare the AR control level of on-demand treatment versus&#xD;
      daily maintenance treatment in moderate-to-severe AR patients. If the on-demand treatment can&#xD;
      achieve similar or non-inferior AR control rate as daily maintenance treatment, it will be&#xD;
      very helpful to optimize current management of AR patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary Data A recent study in 150 pollen-induced AR children found that the percentage&#xD;
      of symptom-free-day was in favor of INS on-demand (30%) compared with low dosage INS daily&#xD;
      (22%), although the statistical significance was not achieved. It implied that on-demand&#xD;
      fluticasone propionate treatment was at least as effective as a regular treatment at a lower&#xD;
      dose. The authors concluded that an on-demand INS strategy has the advantage of a lower&#xD;
      overall corticosteroid exposure and less costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two large randomized controlled studies in mild asthma patients (4215 and 3849 patients were&#xD;
      randomized respectively) also shown that budesonide-formoterol used as needed was&#xD;
      non-inferior to twice-daily budesonide with respect to the rate of severe asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations during 52 weeks of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators have validated the Allergic Rhinitis Control Test (ARCT) questionnaire in 255&#xD;
      AR Chinese patients, the ARCT score ≥20 was regard as controlled AR. Investigators also&#xD;
      validated ARCT questionnaire in guiding stepwise treatment in 510 AR patients. Thus, the ARCT&#xD;
      questionnaire will be used to calculate the AR control level in our study. In our randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial, 129 AR patients received INS without dosage adjustment for 60 days, 85.8%&#xD;
      were controlled AR (ARCT score≥20). In a hospital based study, investigators found that only&#xD;
      4.8% of the AR patients were controlled without taken medication or taken medication&#xD;
      occasionally. However, the data could not reflect the real-life situation as usually only the&#xD;
      intolerable symptoms would drive AR patients to the hospital. There is still lack of data of&#xD;
      AR control rate in on-demand treatment patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Design and Methodology Study Design This is an open-labeled, randomized, controlled&#xD;
      clinical study with HDM-related AR which will be conducted in four multicenter in Central&#xD;
      China.. The symptom uncontrolled moderate-severe AR patient were enrolled with ARCT˂20. In&#xD;
      the run-in period, AR patients will be treated with INS plus AH1 twice daily for 2 weeks and&#xD;
      assessed with ARCT questionnaire and Quality-of-Life Questionnaires. If AR is controlled, the&#xD;
      patients will be randomized into on-demand INS combine intranasal AH1 group, on-demand INS or&#xD;
      daily INS maintenance group and treat for 4 weeks, then the treatment will be stopped and the&#xD;
      patients will be followed up for another 8 weeks. During the study period, the patients have&#xD;
      to fill in the diary card every day to record TNSS and daily ARCT every day. During the&#xD;
      run-in period, the treatment and follow-up period, the patients were followed up every 4&#xD;
      weeks in the hospital to finish ARCT, RQLQ and IPQ questionnaires to compare the AR control&#xD;
      and recurrence time among the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population This is a multi-center study. Patients with persistent moderate-to-severe AR&#xD;
      will be enrolled after sign the informed and content form, adolescents need guardian consent.&#xD;

      participating in other clinical trials; (10) patients who are not suitable for this clinical&#xD;
      trial due to other reasons (evaluated by investigators).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Enroll HDM mono-sensitized AR patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diagnosis and differential diagnosis were made according to ARIA. The other related&#xD;
           diseases that may increase nasal symptoms were excluded according to ARIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate ARCT score, RQLQ, and Brief IPQ questionnaire in the baseline. Treat with&#xD;
           intranasal Azelastine and Fluticasone Propionate and re-evaluate ARCT score to assure&#xD;
           ARCT≥20 after 2 weeks, before randomization. During the run-in period the patients need&#xD;
           to complete the daily TNSS and the daily ARCT on-line.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Randomize into On-demand intranasal Azelastine and Fluticasone Propionate group,&#xD;
           on-demand Fluticasone Propionate group or daily intranasal Fluticasone maintenance&#xD;
           group. The patients have to complete the dairy online to record the TNSS and ARCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The pharmacotherapy will be stopped after 4 weeks and the patients will be followed up&#xD;
           for another 8 weeks. During the follow-up period, the patients filled the diary card&#xD;
           every day to recorded TNSS and ARCT. During the treatment and follow-up period, the&#xD;
           patients have to revisit every 4 weeks in the hospital. ARCT, RQLQ and IPQ&#xD;
           questionnaires were filled in to compare the AR control and recurrence time among the&#xD;
           three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Approach and sample size calculation Referring to the relevant literature,&#xD;
      investigators assume the AR control rate of continuous NCS treatment group will be 85% and&#xD;
      the AR control rates of on-demand NCS group and on-demand NCS + AH1 group both will be 75%,&#xD;
      investigators also set the non-inferiority margin value as 10%, and the enrollment ratio as&#xD;
      1:1:1. The sample size of each group is 49, plus 20% drop-out rate, a total of 180 cases are&#xD;
      required in this trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Possible risks and preventive measures Fluticasone propionate nasal spray and azelastine&#xD;
      hydrochloride nasal spray used in this study have been approved and widely used in AR&#xD;
      patients for many years in China. The common local adverse reactions include epistaxis, nasal&#xD;
      cavity and throat dryness, local nasal pain and irritation, bitter taste or nausea, etc.&#xD;
      Systemic adverse reactions are rare. Any adverse events will be recorded and managed by the&#xD;
      investigators according to Good Clinical Practice guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and statistical analysis Data collection: the patients filled in the diary&#xD;
      on-line every day to record the nasal symptom (TNSS) score and ARCT. The symptoms included&#xD;
      nasal itching, sneezing, runny nose and nasal congestion. The scoring criteria were: 0:&#xD;
      asymptomatic, 1: mild, 2: moderate and 3: severe. The ARCT score was used to assess the&#xD;
      control of AR symptoms. During the treatment and follow-up period, the patients were followed&#xD;
      up every 4 weeks on-site. ARCT, RQLQ and IPQ questionnaires were filled in to compare the AR&#xD;
      control and recurrence among the three groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: the primary endpoint was AR control level at 4-week among the treatment&#xD;
      groups. The secondary endpoint included TNSS scores of different treatment groups, AR&#xD;
      recurrence time after treatment, RQLQ and IPQ questionnaire score comparison and adverse&#xD;
      events among different treatment groups. The data of continuous variables were tested for&#xD;
      normality, and the variables in accordance with normal distribution were expressed by mean ±&#xD;
      standard deviation. T test was used to compare the differences between groups; The variables&#xD;
      of non-normal distribution were expressed by median ± quartile interval. Mann Whitney U test&#xD;
      was used to compare the differences between groups; For binary variables, Chi square test was&#xD;
      used to determine the difference between groups. Kaplan Meier survival curve was used to&#xD;
      analyze the recurrence time of AR in different treatment groups. A p value less than 0.05 was&#xD;
      considered statistically significant.&#xD;
