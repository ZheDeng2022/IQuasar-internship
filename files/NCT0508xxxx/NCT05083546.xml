    <textblock>
      Mechanisms that drive addiction to sugar rich foods are a major driving factor in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of obesity, which has become one of the most significant health care burdens.&#xD;
      The molecular underpinnings of these hedonic mechanisms that drive addiction to sugar are&#xD;
      poorly understood. The investigators demonstrated that methylglyoxal (MGO) derived Advanced&#xD;
      Glycation Endproducts (AGEs) enhance food intake especially under a high sugar diet. The&#xD;
      investigators identified a methylglyoxal (MGO) lowering cocktail, Gly-low, a combination of&#xD;
      alpha-lipoic acid, nicotinamide, thiamine, pyridoxamine, and piperine that demonstrates a&#xD;
      multimodal effect influencing many pathways related to aging including calorie restriction.&#xD;
      Glycation lowering (Gly-low) treatment significantly reduces food intake and weight gain in&#xD;
      the db/db mice that lack the leptin receptor. The investigators also extended the lifespan of&#xD;
      C57BL/6 mice fed with these compounds starting when they were 24 months old. Based on these&#xD;
      results, the investigators hypothesized that methylglyoxal (MGO) lowering cocktail of&#xD;
      compounds can be given to adults with obesity, specified as body mass index (BMI) &gt;27, to&#xD;
      lower serum and urinary markers of insulin resistance, lower boy mass index (BMI), and lower&#xD;
      food intake.&#xD;

      The aging population in the United States of America and around the world is expected to put&#xD;
      enormous pressure on the medical system and thus aging remains the biggest challenge for&#xD;
      biomedicine. The current approaches to slow aging or age-related diseases rely on targeting&#xD;
      specific pathways for each indication, whereas the cause of aging is multifactorial. Hence,&#xD;
      developing drugs that can function in a multimodal fashion to engage multiple pathways&#xD;
      involved in aging is likely to be a much more effective approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous studies have demonstrated that combining mutations in the insulin and tOR (target of&#xD;
      rapamycin) pathway can result in a nearly five-fold extension in lifespan. This study&#xD;
      proposes to achieve similar effects pharmacologically. A compound mix has been identified&#xD;
      utilizing glycation lowering (Gly-low) compounds that alter multiple key pathways involved in&#xD;
      aging including the reduction of calorie intake, Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD)&#xD;
      metabolism, inflammation, glycation stress and increased fat burning. Preliminary findings&#xD;
      that have shown significant increases in survival of normal and diabetic mice models fed with&#xD;
      Gly-low confirms the efficacy of multimodal benefits of Glycation lowering (Gly-low)&#xD;
      compounds. Glycation lowering (Gly-low) compounds were chosen based on their ability to&#xD;
      protect neurons against glycation stress and consist of 5 compounds that have been designated&#xD;
      GRAS (generally regarded as safe) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Based on these&#xD;
      results, the investigators hypothesize that methylglyoxal (MGO) lowering cocktail of&#xD;
      compounds can be given to adults with obesity, specified as body mass index body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) &gt;27, to lower serum and urinary markers of insulin resistance, lower body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI), and lower food intake. Successful completion of this innovative project will result in&#xD;
      a cocktail of compounds that can complement ongoing treatments to reduce obesity and enhance&#xD;
      the health and slow age-related diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single center, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial. 100 subjects&#xD;
      will be recruited between the ages of 50 and 70 yrs with a body mass index (BMI)&gt;27. The&#xD;
      participant will take 3 Gly-low supplements in pill form orally by mouth once in the morning.&#xD;
      Baseline measurements in body mass index (BMI) (height and weight), waist circumference, food&#xD;
      intake and dietary behavior (by questionnaire), urine, and serum will be obtained. Body mass&#xD;
      index (BMI) will be measured every 12 weeks. The primary endpoints will be measures of&#xD;
      physical frailty, based on performance and a clinical frailty index, and cognitive&#xD;
      performance based on a cognitive impairment questionnaire, including memory, will be measured&#xD;
      after 6 months and 12 months. Urine and serum will be analyzed every 12 weeks for various&#xD;
      aging and metabolic markers. Patients will also be monitored for side effects or other&#xD;
      compound related issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening data will be reviewed to determine subject eligibility. Subjects who meet all&#xD;
      inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria will be entered into the study.&#xD;
