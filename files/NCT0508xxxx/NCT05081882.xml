  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tobacco use is the leading cause of many preventable diseases, particularly lung cancer.&#xD;
      Based on the national cancer data in 2020, Florida has the highest lung cancer incidence&#xD;
      (18,150 cases) with the most deaths (10,580 deaths) among all the states in the United&#xD;
      States. Unfortunately, around 16% of adults in Florida continue to smoke cigarettes due to&#xD;
      its addictive nature and the limited success of current cessation strategies. Therefore,&#xD;
      there is an unmet and urgent need for novel interventions to improve the success of tobacco&#xD;
      cessation. If such an intervention can reduce tobacco-associated lung carcinogenesis, that&#xD;
      will be more desirable. The ultimate goal of this study is to develop a safe and effective&#xD;
      kava-based intervention to enable tobacco cessation and reduce lung cancer risk, which will&#xD;
      improve the health of Floridians.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the compliance with a daily kava regimen among active smokers who&#xD;
      have no intention to quit smoking. This study will also investigate whether kava use can&#xD;
      reduce tobacco use and dependence, as well as tobacco-associated lung carcinogenesis.&#xD;
