  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An 18-month randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to compare the effect of fixed&#xD;
      dose ferric citrate versus placebo in patients with advanced chronic kidney disease (eGFR ≤20&#xD;
      ml/min/1.73m2) on the composite endpoint of time to initiation of maintenance dialysis or&#xD;
      all-cause mortality.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial is being&#xD;
      conducted to determine the effect of ferric citrate on the time to a composite endpoint of&#xD;
      initiation of maintenance dialysis or all-cause mortality in patients with non-dialysis&#xD;
      dependent, advanced CKD. 1000 subjects will be randomized in 1:1 ratio to receive either&#xD;
      ferric citrate or matching placebo. All subjects will initiate dosing at 2 tablets per meal&#xD;
      or snacks, up to 3 times per day (maximum of 6 tablets per day). The dose of ferric&#xD;
      citrate/placebo will only be adjusted based on safety and/or tolerability. Given the&#xD;
      double-blind design of this trial, investigators will be instructed to not prescribe&#xD;
      commercial Auryxia to either study arm. The study will be considered completed when&#xD;
      approximately 356 patients with events of the primary composite endpoint have accrued. Study&#xD;
      visits during the treatment period are to be conducted as part of routine scheduled clinical&#xD;
      encounters. Standard of care local laboratory results will be collected however no study&#xD;
      specific laboratory tests other than a pregnancy test in women of child-bearing potential&#xD;
      will be required.&#xD;
