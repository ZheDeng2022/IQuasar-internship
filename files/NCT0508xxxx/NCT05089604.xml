  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized open label study in de novo liver transplant recipients that aims to&#xD;
      compare the risk of tacrolimus induced tremors with once daily extended-release formulation,&#xD;
      Envarsus, versus the twice daily immediate-release formulation. Both formulations of&#xD;
      tacrolimus are currently approved for the prevention of rejection in liver transplant&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Purpose: This study is designed to evaluate the incidence and severity of tremors with two&#xD;
      different tacrolimus formulations (LCPT versus IR-TAC) when administered in combination with&#xD;
      mycophenolate and short term corticosteroids in de novo liver transplant (LT) recipients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: In de novo liver transplant recipients, an LCPT-based immunosuppression regimen,&#xD;
      in combination with mycophenolate and short term steroids offers improved neurotoxicity&#xD;
      profile as evidenced by lower incidence and severity of tremors and treatment discontinuation&#xD;
      when compared to an identical regimen using twice-daily immediate-release tacrolimus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: Tacrolimus is the first line immunosuppressive agent in all organ transplantation&#xD;
      and its use is associated with improved patient and graft outcomes. Neurotoxicity including&#xD;
      headaches and tremors are amongst common dose limiting toxicities associated with tacrolimus&#xD;
      early after liver transplantation. Mitigation strategies include dosage reduction or switch&#xD;
      to CSA, both of which can put patient at risk of rejection and other toxicities. LCPT is a&#xD;
      new extended release formulation with improved PK parameters and evidence of improved&#xD;
      tolerability (lower risk of tremors) in renal transplant population. In this study, we will&#xD;
      compare the incidence and severity of tremors associated with IR-TAC, which is currently&#xD;
      standard of care at our institution, with LCPT, which is a new dosage form added to the&#xD;
      hospital formulary. We will be using wearable sensors to assess the severity of tremors.&#xD;
      Furthermore, the objective and systematic documentation of tremor severity during the first 8&#xD;
      weeks after transplantation will provide granular data that will elucidate the natural&#xD;
      history of tacrolimus induced tremors early post liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research design: This is a single centre, prospective, randomized, open label, parallel group&#xD;
      trial in adult de novo liver transplant recipients. Patients will be randomized (1:1) to&#xD;
      either LCPT or IR-TAC, both groups will receive mycophenolate and short term steroids&#xD;
      according to the standard of care protocol. This is a superiority study.&#xD;

    <measure>Immunosuppression medication adherence as assessed by the Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ) at 8 weeks after transplant</measure>
    <time_frame>8 weeks post transplant</time_frame>
    <description>Simplified Medication Adherence Questionnaire (SMAQ) consists of six questions evaluating different aspects of patient adherence, such as forgetfulness, routine and adverse events. SMAQ is a self-reported questionnaire that has been validated in transplant population. Patients are considered adherent if they reply to all questions with an adherent answer in all six SMAQ items. (ie 1-&quot;yes&quot; , 2-4 - &quot;no&quot;, not having missed more than 2 doses during last week or having failed to take the medication on not more than 2 days during the last 3 months.&#xD;
We are measuring SMAQ twice for this study (at 8 weeks and again at 12 months). Based on the literature, transplant patients are more likely to be adherent early after transplantation but they become progressively less adherent with time after transplant. We would like to determine if once daily tacrolimus has any impact on adherence.</description>
