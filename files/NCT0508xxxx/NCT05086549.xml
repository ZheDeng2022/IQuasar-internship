  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to observe changes in various indicators of renal function, such as&#xD;
      proteinuria at different time points: short-term (Week 8), 6 months (Week 26), and a year&#xD;
      (Week 52), in patients with DKD and hypertension, who are given antihypertensives containing&#xD;
      fimasartan, in an actual clinical environment where a variety of patient characteristics are&#xD;
      reflected.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective observational study is conducted in about 5 medical institutions located in&#xD;
      Korea, which are equal to or larger than a hospital, and patients with type 2 diabetic kidney&#xD;
      disease (proteinuria with an ACR of 10 mg/g or higher), who are being administered or plan to&#xD;
      be administered with antihypertensives containing fimasartan for essential hypertension, are&#xD;
      enrolled as the subjects. Each of the subjects shall undergo follow-up for about a year (52&#xD;
      weeks). After explaining the purpose, method, scope of information to be collected, and&#xD;
      procedure of this study to potential subjects, the investigator shall obtain the written&#xD;
      consent for voluntary participation and set the day when the antihypertensive containing&#xD;
      fimasartan is administered as the baseline. If the fimasartan-based antihypertensive&#xD;
      treatment is already ongoing, only the patients within 6 weeks from the baseline shall be&#xD;
      considered as the subjects. In this case, data from between the baseline and the time of the&#xD;
      written consent shall be collected retrospectively. This study is an observational study, and&#xD;
      the drugs which are administered during the study period and the medical procedures shall be&#xD;
      in accordance with the clinical judgment of the investigator. It is a rule that no&#xD;
      unnecessary intervention shall be imposed on the subjects by this study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The scope of data to be collected during this study period is as follows.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic information&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease information (diabetes, hypertension, renal disease, other past medical history&#xD;
           and intercurrent diseases)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical measurements (height and weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic blood pressure measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Laboratory test results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Antihypertensives, hypoglycemic agents, and other concomitant drugs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fimasartan-related adverse drug reactions and serious adverse drug reactions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death information (if applicable)&#xD;
