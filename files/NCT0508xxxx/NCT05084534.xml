  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Refractory ascites is seen in 17% of cirrhotic patients with the 1year mortality rate being&#xD;
      high, upto 20-50% [1]. The pathogenesis of cirrhotic ascites includes release of vasodilatory&#xD;
      molecules like nitric oxide, damage associated molecular pathogens (DAMPs) and pattern&#xD;
      associated molecular pathogens (PAMPs) secondary to bacterial translocation, which causes&#xD;
      splanchnic bed vasodilation resulting in activation of renin-angiotensin and aldosterone axis&#xD;
      causing sodium and water retention. The standard medical therapy for the treatment of ascites&#xD;
      includes sodium restriction to 2mEq/kg/day with diuretics (Spirinolactone 3-6mg/kg/day and&#xD;
      furosemide 0.5-2 mg/kg/day) and therapeutic paracentesis (&gt;50ml/kg/day) with albumin&#xD;
      replacement at 8g/L of ascitic fluid tapped. Refractory ascites is defined as ascites that&#xD;
      cannot be mobilized by sodium - restricted diet (maximum upto 2mEq/kg/day- 88meq=2gm of salt)&#xD;
      and high-dose diuretic treatment (6 mg/kg/day of spironolactone and 2 mg/kg/day of&#xD;
      furosemide) or optimum doses of diuretics cannot be given due to development of&#xD;
      diuretic-induced complications (Sodium &lt;130mEq, AKI as per KDIGO, hypovolemia, hypo&#xD;
      (&lt;3.5meq)/hyperkalemia (&gt;5meq); new onset HE) and recurrent ascites as ascites that has&#xD;
      recurred within a 12 weeks period despite standard treatment. All the children and&#xD;
      adolescents upto 18 years of age with refractory or recurrent ascites will be included in the&#xD;
      study and randomized into 2 groups. One group will receive only standard medical therapy and&#xD;
      other group will receive midodrine and standard medical therapy for 12 weeks. Mean arterial&#xD;
      pressure will be monitored at every OPD visit. At the end of 12 weeks, plasma renin activity,&#xD;
      number of therapeutic paracentesis done, change in serum sodium, estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate and complications will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is complete resolution of ascites, liver transplantation or death before 12 weeks,&#xD;
      midodrine will be stopped.&#xD;

      Aim: To determine the efficacy of midodrine in combination with standard medical therapy in&#xD;
      reduction of refractory or recurrent ascites in children with cirrhosis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the proportion of patients who will achieve partial or complete control of&#xD;
      ascites at 12 weeks after therapy between the two groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of total number of therapeutic paracentesis (&gt;50ml/kg) procedures between the&#xD;
           groups by the end of 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of complete response (elimination of ascites) by 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time taken to achieve complete response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of partial response (persistent ascites not requiring therapeutic&#xD;
           paracentesis) by 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare change in plasma renin activity from baseline to 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in serum sodium from baseline to 4 weeks and 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in eGFR from baseline to 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in MAP at 1 week, 4 weeks and 12 weeks from baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Comparison of proportion of patients with transplant free survival at 12 weeks between&#xD;
           the 2 groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of worsening HE by 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of development of HRS by 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Proportion of patients developing hypertension at 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Frequency of development of adverse effects by 12 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
