  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This randomized trial is set out to compare the postoperative strength preservation capacity&#xD;
      of local infiltration anesthesia (LIA) and pericapsular nerve group (PENG) block after&#xD;
      performing a primary total hip arthroplasty (THA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that LIA represents a superior alternative to PENG block in terms of&#xD;
      strength preservation but providing effective analgesia during the first 24 postoperative&#xD;
      hours after THA. Hence, the trial was designed as a superiority study hypothesizing a&#xD;
      fivefold reduction in quadriceps paresis/paralysis at 3 hours.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who agree to participate in the protocol will be assigned to one group or another&#xD;
      (LIA and PENG) through computationally generated block randomization. Outcome assessors&#xD;
      blinded to randomization will perform all measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All blocks, LIA or PENG, will be performed (or supervised) by one of the co-authors, an&#xD;
      expert orthopedic surgeon or an expert anesthesiologist, respectively. Both blocks will be&#xD;
      executed in the operating room, on the surgical table, under sedation, and with the barrier&#xD;
      that separates the surgical field from the cranial area of the patient to keep the latter&#xD;
      blind to the technique received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo spinal anesthesia using 0.5% bupivacaine (10mg) plus 20 μg of&#xD;
      fentanyl. Both groups will also receive tranexamic acid 1g intravenous (IV), ketoprofen 100mg&#xD;
      IV, and acetaminophen 1gr IV. Propofol sedation guided with a targeted controlled infusion&#xD;
      (TCI) model will be administered in order to obtain an adequate level of sedation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All surgeries will be conducted by the same team of surgeons, performing a posterior approach&#xD;
      technique in the lateral decubitus position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the recovery room, all patients will receive patient-controlled analgesia (morphine bolus&#xD;
      = 1 mg; lockout interval = 8 minutes). On the surgical ward, all subjects will continue to&#xD;
      receive acetaminophen (1 g per os every 6 hours), ketoprofen (100 mg per os every 8 hours) as&#xD;
      well and patient-controlled analgesia (morphine bolus = 1 mg IV; lockout interval = 8&#xD;
      minutes).&#xD;
