      The investigators designed a single center, open-label, prospective study. Adults with active&#xD;
      primary Sjögren's Syndrome will be enrolled, meeting the American College of&#xD;
      Rheumatology(ACR) &amp; European allance of associations for rheumatology(EULAR)(2016) diagnostic&#xD;
      criteria . Tofacitinib 5 mg bd was administered for 6 months to explore its efficacy and&#xD;
      safety. The improvement of clinical and laboratory indexes was evaluated. Changes of immune&#xD;
      cell subsets and cytokines were monitored.&#xD;
