  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pelvic cancer pain is a chronic condition related to the involvement of viscera, pelvic&#xD;
      muscular structures or neural structures by tumor. The superior hypogastric plexus block is a&#xD;
      sympathetic block used to treat pelvic visceral pain that is unresponsive to oral or&#xD;
      parenteral opioids different approaches for superior hypogastric block as transdiscal&#xD;
      approach, classic approach, Posteromedial approach, CT guided approach and ultrasound&#xD;
      anterior approach The ultrasound-guided superior hypogastric plexus neurolysis technique&#xD;
      (anterior approach) is simple to perform. We believe this block can be useful in cancer&#xD;
      patients who are having difficulty in lying prone, because it is a procedure performed in the&#xD;
      supine position and it is less time-consuming. It also avoids the radiation exposure involved&#xD;
      with a computed tomography-guided and fluoroscopy posterior approach.&#xD;

      Aim of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare Fluoroscopic guided transdiscal superior hypogastric block and Ultrasound guided&#xD;
      superior hypogastric block regarding their efficacy to control pelvic pain and&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be described as mean Â±SD or as frequencies (number of cases) and percentages when&#xD;
      appropriate. Comparison of numerical variables between two study groups will be carried out&#xD;
      using parametric and non-parametric t- tests for independent samples. Within group comparison&#xD;
      of numerical variables was carried out using repeated measures ANOVA. P values of less than&#xD;
      0.05 will be statistically significant. All statistical calculations are performed using&#xD;
      statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS, version 23 for Microsoft Windows; SPSS&#xD;
      Inc., Chicago, Illinois, USA)&#xD;

    <description>Patient quality of life SF-36 19 (consists of eight scaled scores, which are the weighted sums of the questions in their section. Each scale is directly transformed into a 0-100 scale on the assumption that each question carries equal weight. The lower the score the more disability. The higher the score the less disability i.e., a score of zero is equivalent to maximum disability and a score of 100 is equivalent to no disability.&#xD;

    <description>Patient lies prone, L5-S1 interspace identified under fluoroscopy, the skin is prepared and sterile drapes are placed after local anesthetic infiltration of the skin the subcutaneous tissue with 2% lidocaine a 20 guage, 15 cm needle with short bevel is inserted at the center of L5- S1 interlaminar space under anteroposterior fluoroscopic vision. The needle is then advanced toward the intervertebral disc. After confirmation, the needle is advanced through the intervertebral disc until it exists at its anterior surface confirmed by administration of 4 ml of soluble contrast media in both lateral and anteroposterior fluoroscopic view. Neurolysis is performed with 8 ml 8 % phenol solution. After neurolysis, 0.5 ml of saline is given to avoid the deposition of phenol within the intervertebral disc material. While withdrawing, the needle cephazoline 50 mg in 1 ml is injected into the disc.</description>

    <description>Patients are placed in the supine position and after sterilization, the low-frequency curved probe is used in the longitudinal axis to visualize the aortic bifurcation and is identified using a longitudinal Ultra-Sound (Phillips Healthcare, Andover, Massachusetts, US). Next, the probe is placed deeply transverse till aorta end and bifurcation seen of iliac vessels once seen we enter out of plane and inject.as it lies in front the vertebral body of the L5 vertebra. Local infiltration with 1% lidocaine is obtained at port of entry 1-1.5 inches below the umbilicus. A 15-cm, 22-G Chiba needle is inserted (out-of-plane) and advanced by avoiding vascular structures until contact with the L5-body. The needle will be withdrawan the 1-2 mm and inject 8 ml 8% phenol in saline. Finally, 0.5 ml of lidocaine is injected during Chiba needle removal</description>
