    <textblock>
      Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the fourth most common cancer and the second leading cause of&#xD;
      cancer death among men and women in the United States (US). The lifetime risk of colorectal&#xD;
      cancer in both men and women in the US is approximately 6%. About 93% of colorectal cancer&#xD;
      (CRC) diagnoses are in patients older than 50 years (Siegel 2014). Randomized controlled&#xD;
      trials show that screening for CRC significantly decreases CRC incidence and mortality&#xD;
      (Schoen 2012, Atkin 2010, Mandel 1999, Mandel 2000). CRC screening has received a Grade A&#xD;
      recommendation from the US Preventive Services Task Force.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the U.S., colonoscopy is the most utilized screening modality for CRC. On a population&#xD;
      basis, screening rates, which were around 40-50%, have now increased to 65%, and a goal to&#xD;
      increase to 80% compliance is being promoted (CDC 2011, CDC 2013, Meester 2015).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adenomatous polyps are the acknowledged precursors of colorectal cancer. Identification and&#xD;
      removal of adenomas is the mechanism by which screening is effective in reducing CRC&#xD;
      incidence and subsequent mortality. &quot;Advanced&quot; adenomas are adenomas which are greater than&#xD;
      or equal to 1 cm, or have a &quot;villous&quot; component (tubulovillous or villous), or have foci of&#xD;
      high grade dysplasia. Advanced adenomas are associated with increased long-term risk of&#xD;
      cancer, even years after colonoscopy (Click 2018). The prevalence of advanced adenomas at&#xD;
      screening colonoscopy is 5-10% (Ferlitsch 2011, Imperiale 2014). Non-advanced adenomas are&#xD;
      adenomas greater than 1 cm with neither villous components nor high grade dysplasia.&#xD;
      Non-advanced adenomas are much more common than advanced adenomas, present in around 30% of&#xD;
      colonoscopy exams (Ferlitsch 2011, Imperiale 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After detection of adenomas, patients are advised to return periodically for surveillance&#xD;
      colonoscopy. Patients with 1-2 non-advanced adenomas are recommended by guidelines to return&#xD;
      in 5 - 10 years for follow-up surveillance colonoscopy (Lieberman 2012). However, there are&#xD;
      no guidelines on how to triage individuals to 5 as opposed to 10 years. Furthermore, there is&#xD;
      limited evidence supporting the effectiveness of surveillance colonoscopy in reducing CRC&#xD;
      incidence. A retrospective study in patients with advanced adenomas demonstrated benefit&#xD;
      (Atkin 2017), but the study was not randomized and did not include patients with 1-2&#xD;
      non-advanced adenomas. The only randomized trial of surveillance colonoscopy was reported in&#xD;
      the early 1990's, when participants were randomized to 3 vs. 1- and 3- year surveillance&#xD;
      (Winawer 1993). No difference in advanced adenoma detection was observed when comparing&#xD;
      participants examined at the two screening intervals, and as a result, guidelines were&#xD;
      modified with participants advised to return every 3 years after adenomatous polyp detection.&#xD;
      The recommended interval for non-advanced adenomas was gradually lengthened to the current&#xD;
      standard, but there is no randomized, controlled data to support that interval. Furthermore,&#xD;
      observational data of surveillance colonoscopy practice in the U.S. demonstrate that&#xD;
      recommended intervals are often not adhered to, and individuals return for repeat testing&#xD;
      well ahead of guideline recommendations (Schoen 2010, Lieberman 2014).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, if anything, retrospective, natural history studies of non-advanced adenomas do&#xD;
      not support the association of non-advanced adenoma with a higher risk of subsequent&#xD;
      colorectal cancer (Atkin 1992, Spencer 1984, Loberg 2014). For example, in a classic study&#xD;
      from the United Kingdom, patients with small rectosigmoid adenomas, even if multiple, did not&#xD;
      have an increased risk of CRC compared to the general population, over a 14-year mean&#xD;
      follow-up time (Atkin 1992). In a recent observational study from Norway, participants with a&#xD;
      low-risk adenoma followed over a median of 7.7 years (maximum 19 years) without subsequent&#xD;
      surveillance colonoscopy, had a lower CRC mortality than the general population (Loberg&#xD;
      2014), implying that although the initial colonoscopy may be protective, subsequent follow-up&#xD;
      colonoscopy was not required. More recently, several studies have reported that individuals&#xD;
      with non-advanced adenomas do not have an increased risk of colorectal cancer compared to&#xD;
      those with no adenomas (Click 2018, Lieberman 2019, Lee 2019).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another recent major development affecting screening is that practitioners of colonoscopy are&#xD;
      now recommended to monitor and insure their adenoma detection rates are high. Data from&#xD;
      Poland (Kaminski 2010) and Kaiser Permanente in California (Corley 2014) have demonstrated&#xD;
      that a higher adenoma detection rate (ADR) is associated with a lower long-term risk of&#xD;
      interval CRC, or cancer occurring after colonoscopy. Our understanding of these observations&#xD;
      is premised on the notion that leaving pre-neoplastic tissue (adenomas) in situ, (such as&#xD;
      what occurs with a lower ADR), increases the chance that an adenoma left behind will&#xD;
      subsequently transform into cancer. The concern over interval cancers has stimulated quality&#xD;
      concerns about the practice of colonoscopy. Guidelines for a recommended ADR at screening&#xD;
      colonoscopy are rising, from the initial targets of 15% in women and 25% in men (Lieberman&#xD;
      2012) to 20% in women and 30% in men or 25% overall. ADRs in clinical studies are now&#xD;
      commonly over 30% and some practitioners report rates exceeding 50%. However, adenomas that&#xD;
      are detected when the ADR is high or as it increases over time are generally small,&#xD;
      non-advanced adenomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current clinical practice favoring colonoscopy-based screening with increased emphasis on&#xD;
      detection of adenomas, most of which will turn out to be small, non-advanced adenomas, will&#xD;
      greatly increase demand for utilization of surveillance colonoscopy exams in the coming&#xD;
      decades. Yet, the evidence for determining the benefit, optimal timing, and recommended&#xD;
      frequency of surveillance colonoscopy is unknown. A randomized, clinical trial to demonstrate&#xD;
      the difference in yield between 5- or 10-year surveillance for participants with non-advanced&#xD;
      adenoma is needed to guide clinical practice. Only a randomized trial will be authoritative&#xD;
      enough to define good clinical practice and directly influence clinical care.&#xD;
