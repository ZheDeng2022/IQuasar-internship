  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study to evaluate how well an online format would work for the first&#xD;
      post-operative visit after a patient undergoes colon and rectal surgery. This online format&#xD;
      is integrated into Epic MyChart. This study aims to determine whether the online format is&#xD;
      feasible and acceptable to patients and surgeons as a standard post-operative visit.&#xD;

      Participants were asked to complete a post-operative survey using an online patient portal,&#xD;
      EPIC MyChart, after elective abdominal colon or rectal resection. Participants were also&#xD;
      asked to do upload a picture of their incisions. Colorectal surgeons reviewed&#xD;
      responses/pictures and communicated concerns/recommendations via the same patient portal. At&#xD;
      the in-person follow-up visit, both patients and colorectal surgeons completed a satisfaction&#xD;
      survey regarding the both visit types.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Age 18 or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Planned/underwent surgery that was performed by a surgeon in the Division of Colon and&#xD;
             Rectal Surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Requires a post-operative follow-up outpatient visit 2-3 weeks from surgery or from&#xD;
             discharge from hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Has access to a smart mobile phone, tablet or computer to access online web interface&#xD;
             for the web-based visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with an Epic MyChart account set up.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Has ability to take photographs of surgical incision or has access to someone who can&#xD;
             take a picture for them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Requires visiting nurse services at discharge from hospital&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Cannot use web-based interface or unable to complete questions online&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cannot read English, speak English, or would require interpreter services. The reason&#xD;
             for excluding these patients is there are not yet MyChart services available in&#xD;
             non-English languages at Umass Memorial. It would not be fiscally possible to acquire&#xD;
             these for a pilot feasibility study. As the MyChart experience is meant to be&#xD;
             completed at home, it would not be possible to provider a medical interpreter in a&#xD;
             non-office or hospital setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Adults unable to consent (adults lacking capacity)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Individuals who are not yet adults (infants, children, teenagers)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prisoners&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Pregnant women&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients undergoing anal surgery&#xD;
