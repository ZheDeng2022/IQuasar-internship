  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite the fact that several efficacious interventions for dental fear exist, it continues&#xD;
      to be among the most common, and least addressed phobias among individuals. This reality is&#xD;
      largely due to dissemination, or lack thereof. Research is needed on how to disseminate and&#xD;
      implement such treatment in a way that recognizes the barriers to accessing and entering&#xD;
      treatment for dental fear. Using a collaborative care approach, the investigators will pilot&#xD;
      test, for feasibility and acceptability, a brief 2-step dental fear intervention. The first&#xD;
      step will be an app intervention for moderate-to-severe dental that can be accessed by&#xD;
      participants on a mobile device. The second step will consist of a one-hour face-to-face CBT&#xD;
      intervention for participants delivered by a mental health professional at their dentist's&#xD;
      office.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Dental fear is among the most common individual phobias, and has devastating effects on oral&#xD;
      and physical health, as well as emotional well-being. The behavioral avoidance associated&#xD;
      with dental fear leads to neglect of prophylactic care, more dental emergencies, increased&#xD;
      pain and suffering for individuals, and greater financial burdens, both for patients and&#xD;
      society at large. Treatment remains inaccessible to the vast majority of fearful patients.&#xD;
      Extremely efficacious brief evidence-based interventions for dental fear have not been&#xD;
      administered outside of the specialty clinics in which they were developed. This is despite&#xD;
      the ubiquitous nature of dental fear and its well-document impact on public health. Further,&#xD;
      none of these existing treatment models can be easily incorporating into dental practices&#xD;
      (due to issues of logistics, credentialed providers, time, financial costs, and disruptions&#xD;
      of workflow).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research is needed on how to disseminate and implement such treatment in a way that&#xD;
      recognizes the barriers to accessing and entering treatment for dental fear. The&#xD;
      investigators propose to pilot test, for feasibility and acceptability, Dental FearLess, a&#xD;
      brief, free, self-directed, computerized intervention for moderate-to-severe dental fear that&#xD;
      can be implemented in the waiting room of dental offices. Patients reporting&#xD;
      moderate-to-severe dental fear after completing Dental FearLess will be offered a follow-up&#xD;
      1-hour session that covers the same content in person. Clearly, the challenge at present is&#xD;
      not how to treat dental fear to reduce the financial and human suffering burden to public&#xD;
      health, but how to disseminate and implement Evidence Based Interventions (EBIs) for dental&#xD;
      fear in a way that recognizes the rewards and barriers in the U.S. healthcare system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stepped-care interventions have demonstrated efficacy for other behavioral and emotional&#xD;
      problems. The investigators aim to test whether such interventions are feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable, for both dentists and patients, for dental fear. If the pilot evaluation shows&#xD;
      promise, it can be tested in larger studies and, if effective, be more widely implemented in&#xD;
      the normal course of dental practice. This could improve uptake and, ultimately, patient&#xD;
      outcomes compared with existing psychosocial interventions for dental fear.&#xD;

    <description>Dental FearLess, is a self-administered psychoeducational intervention that will be accessed by participants via their personal smart device (In other words, this is an online application in which investigators present information about dental procedures. The user selects the procedure on which they would like information and then views a brief video on the selected procedure. It uses evidence-based tools to help participants manage their thoughts, feelings, and behavior related to dental fear to reduce fear during encounters with dental professionals.</description>
