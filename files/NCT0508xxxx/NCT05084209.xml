  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Persons with Parkinson's disease and family care partners are often unprepared to make&#xD;
      difficult, future medical decisions. Earlier conversations about future medical decisions&#xD;
      between persons with Parkinson's disease and family care partners are needed before&#xD;
      communication and cognitive difficulties become severe. In this study, the investigators will&#xD;
      pilot test a novel dyadic intervention to help persons with Parkinson's disease and family&#xD;
      care partners make future medical decisions. The investigators hypothesize the intervention&#xD;
      will be feasible and acceptable among persons with Parkinson's disease and family care&#xD;
      partners.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators are looking for pairs of participants consisting of a person with a diagnosis&#xD;
      of Parkinson's Disease, and a family care partner who is most likely to help make medical&#xD;
      decisions in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this study, pairs will complete a survey to understand how engaged participants are in&#xD;
      discussing future medical decisions, demographics, and the severity of Parkinson's disease.&#xD;
      This survey will take about half an hour. Then, participants will work through a medical&#xD;
      decision making support intervention together. Completing the intervention in-person, on the&#xD;
      phone, or via video conferencing is acceptable. The resources will provide information on&#xD;
      future medical decisions participants may need to make. The intervention is completely online&#xD;
      and will take about 30 minutes to complete. Participants will have 2 weeks to complete the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will call participants a week after enrollment to ask about technical&#xD;
      difficulties completing the intervention, provide assistance with intervention material&#xD;
      navigation as needed, and answer questions about the intervention. Participants will receive&#xD;
      another online survey 2 weeks after enrollment to understand engagement in discussing future&#xD;
      medical decisions, and acceptability of the intervention. The 2 week survey will take about&#xD;
      15 minutes to complete.&#xD;

The resources will include information on medical decisions that may occur in Parkinson's disease, and general medical decisions that anyone may need to make (i.e. choosing a medical decision maker). The resources will also include suggestions on how to discuss these decisions.</description>
