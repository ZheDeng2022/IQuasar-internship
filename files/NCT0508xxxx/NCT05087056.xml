      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      combined meningococcal groups A, B, C, W and Y (MenABCWY) vaccine (GSK3536819A) intended to&#xD;
      protect against invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by all 5 meningococcal&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of participants with solicited administration site events</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) following each vaccination (Vaccines administered at Day 1, Day 721 and Day 1441)</time_frame>
    <description>The solicited administration site events include pain, redness, swelling and induration. Redness, swelling, and induration are summarized according to defined severity grading scales: None (1 to 24mm); Mild (25 to 50mm); Moderate (51 to 100mm); Severe (&gt;100mm). Injection site pain is summarized according to &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with solicited systemic events</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) following each vaccination (Vaccines administered at Day 1, Day 721 and Day 1441)</time_frame>
    <description>The solicited systemic events include fever, headache, nausea, myalgia, arthralgia and fatigue. Fever is defined as body temperature 38.0°C (100.4°F). The preferred location for measuring temperature in this study is the oral route. Solicited systemic events (except fever) are summarized according to &quot;mild&quot;, &quot;moderate&quot; or &quot;severe&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with any unsolicited adverse events (AEs) including all serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal, adverse events of special interest (AESIs) and medically attended AEs</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 30 days (including the day of vaccination) following each vaccination (Vaccines administered at Day 1, Day 721 and Day 1441)</time_frame>
    <description>An unsolicited AE is an AE that was not included in a list of solicited events and must have been spontaneously communicated by a participant/participant's parent(s)/ Legally Acceptable Representative(s) who has signed the informed consent. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in disability/incapacity, is a congenital anomaly/birth defect in the offspring of a study subject or is an abnormal pregnancy outcome. AESIs are predefined AEs of scientific and medical concern specific to the product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate, because such an event might warrant further investigation in order to characterise and understand it. Medically attended AEs are symptoms or illnesses requiring a hospitalisation, or an emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider.</description>
