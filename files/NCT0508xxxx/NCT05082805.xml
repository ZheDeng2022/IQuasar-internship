  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a longitudinal, observational, prospective, multicentre study conducted in France,&#xD;
      among a representative sample of rheumatology doctors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to describe in real life the therapeutic strategy when faced with a&#xD;
      patient with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) or psoriatic arthritis (PsA) who requires initiation&#xD;
      of treatment with biotherapy or targeted therapy. The evolution of the disease and the&#xD;
      possible therapeutic adaptations will then be followed for 2 years.&#xD;
