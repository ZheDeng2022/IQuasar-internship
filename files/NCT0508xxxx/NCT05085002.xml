    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, single-arm, open-label study to evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      lerociclib in combination with standard endocrine therapy in women with HR+/HER2- MBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will consist of either newly diagnosed, treatment naïve women with&#xD;
      HR+/HER2- MBC (1L population) or women with HR+/HER2- MBC who have already progressed on&#xD;
      first line endocrine therapy such as tamoxifen, anastrozole, or letrozole (2L population).&#xD;
      All participants must either be postmenopausal or receiving active ovarian suppression&#xD;
      (goserelin).&#xD;
