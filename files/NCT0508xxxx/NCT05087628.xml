    <textblock>
      The PREVAIL-2 study is designed to assess the safety and potential efficacy of PRV-3279 in&#xD;
      flare prevention in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients with active disease after&#xD;
      amelioration induced by corticosteroid treatment.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study in adult patients with active&#xD;
      SLE. Approximately 100 eligible patients will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio to receive&#xD;
      treatment with either PRV-3279 or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects include male or female adults, 18 to 70 years of age, with a diagnosis of&#xD;
      SLE for at least 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study drug will be administered every 4 weeks for 20 weeks in a double-blind fashion,&#xD;
      followed by an 8-week safety follow-up period.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. A diagnosis of SLE for at least 6 months prior to the Screening visit&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Meet the 2019 European League Against Rheumatism/American College of Rheumatology&#xD;
             (EULAR/ACR) criteria for SLE at Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have moderate to severe disease activity despite stable standard-of-care medication&#xD;
             defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             At screening: hSLEDAI score ≥6 (≥4 points of which must come from non-serological&#xD;
             finding), OR at least one BILAG A or one B score; At randomization: ≥4-point drop in&#xD;
             hSLEDAI, OR one BILAG letter grade improvement in at least one A or B score present at&#xD;
             Screening, and investigator or central adjudication committee (CAC) rating of definite&#xD;
             improvement or major or complete improvement&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Able and willing to stop all lupus treatments, except antimalarials, corticosteroids&#xD;
             (prednisone equivalent ≤ 10 mg), and NSAIDs&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Active lupus nephritis or active central nervous system manifestations of SLE&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Other inflammatory or autoimmune diseases that, in the opinion of the Investigator or&#xD;
             CAC, may confound efficacy evaluations&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Common variable immunodeficiency syndrome or any other clinically significant&#xD;
             immunodeficiency&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Known COVID-19 infection in the 4 weeks before Screening or positive SARS-CoV-2 RNA&#xD;
             test&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Received a live attenuated vaccine within 2 months of Screening, received a non-live&#xD;
             or mRNA vaccine within 2 weeks of Screening, or expecting to receive any vaccine&#xD;
             during the study period&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Any recent infection requiring antibiotics within two weeks of Screening or any recent&#xD;
             infection requiring IV antibiotics or hospitalization within 1 month of Screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Any condition for which, in the opinion of the Investigator or CAC, participation in&#xD;
             the study would not be in the best interest of the patient (e.g., compromise their&#xD;
             well-being) or that could prevent, limit, or confound the protocol-specified&#xD;
             assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Participated in any interventional clinical trial within 42 days prior to Screening or&#xD;
             within five half-lives of the investigational product, whichever is longer&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Received rituximab or equivalent treatment that depletes B cells within 6 months of&#xD;
             Screening unless return of B cells to pre-treatment value or normal range can be&#xD;
             demonstrated.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Received tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, interleukin antagonists, or other&#xD;
             biologics, including belimumab, within 42 days or five half-lives of the agent,&#xD;
             whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Received IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) or IV cyclophosphamide within 2 months, prednisone ≥&#xD;
             100 mg/day for more than 30 days within 2 months, or plasmapheresis within two months&#xD;
             of the Screening visit.&#xD;
