  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a quality improvement initiative with the goal of optimizing heart failure (HF)&#xD;
      patients seen through the outpatient cardiac implantable electronic device clinic at the&#xD;
      University of Ottawa Heart Institute (UOHI). The UOHI device clinic oversees more than 12,000&#xD;
      in-clinic patient visits annually with over 5000 visits for patients with reduced ejection&#xD;
      fraction (EF) and HF. In patients with reduced EF, guideline directed medical therapy&#xD;
      compliance (GDMT) is sub-optimal in real world clinical practice. Considering the most recent&#xD;
      changes to The Canadian Cardiovascular Society heart failure guideline recommendations, the&#xD;
      compliance rate may be even lower than reported rates in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this study is to optimize GDMT through collaboration between the HF clinic, a&#xD;
      HF/arrhythmia nurse practitioner, and application of a nurse run algorithm based pathway to&#xD;
      identify patients suitable for medication optimization and guiding the most responsible&#xD;
      physician (MRP) for their heart failure (PCP, cardiologist or HF physician) through a letter.&#xD;
      The compliance rate will also be re-evaluated to assess improvement in GDMT in this patient&#xD;
      population. GDMT will ensure the greatest chance to improve patient outcomes by reducing&#xD;
      heart failure hospitalizations, emergency room visits, ventricular arrhythmias, implantable&#xD;
      cardioverter defibrillator shocks, clinic visits, and thereby improving patients' quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The goal of this quality improvement initiative is to optimize goal directed medical therapy&#xD;
      compliance (GDMT) in heart failure (HF) patients seen at the University of Ottawa Heart&#xD;
      Institute (UOHI) device clinic. GDMT is reported as low as 45% and a recent Canadian survey&#xD;
      reports estimated compliance as low as 15%. The project will be performed in 3 phases. Phase&#xD;
      1 will aim to establish the rates of GDMT compliance in heart failure patients seen through&#xD;
      the device clinic. The chart of 600 consecutive implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD)&#xD;
      patients will be reviewed to establish the current compliance rate with GDMT in patients with&#xD;
      reduced ejection fraction (EF). In Phase 2, the goal is to optimize GDMT through&#xD;
      collaboration between the HF clinic and a nurse run algorithm based pathway to identify&#xD;
      patients suitable for medication optimization and guiding the most responsible physician&#xD;
      (MRP) for their heart failure (PCP, cardiologist or HF physician) through a letter. The&#xD;
      ultimate goal is to improve the quality of life of patients seen at the institute. In Phase&#xD;
      3, the compliance rate will be re-evaluated every 6 months to assess for improvement in GDMT&#xD;
      in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 1 (establishing baseline medication compliance), the charts of 600 consecutive&#xD;
      ICD patients will be reviewed using PACeART and EPIC databases. Rate of GDMT compliance will&#xD;
      be calculated. For the purposes of this investigation, and in patients with EF &lt; 40% at the&#xD;
      time of ICD clinic visit, GDMT is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. NHYA I and ACE-I/ARB OR ARNI+BB+MRA+SGL2 or&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. NYHA II or above and on ARNI+BB+MRA+SGL2&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACE-I refers to Angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor medication, ARB refers to Angiotensin&#xD;
      II receptor blocker medication, ARNI refers to angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor&#xD;
      medication, BB refers to beta blocker medication, MRA refers to aldosterone receptor&#xD;
      antagonist medication, and SGL2 refers to sodium-glucose cotransporter-2 inhibitor&#xD;
      medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 2 (medication optimization through collaborative work with heart function&#xD;
      clinic, primary cardiologist and device clinic), all patients seen with ICD and reduced EF at&#xD;
      the UOHI device clinic will be given a questionnaire by the clinic assistant. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will be comprised of 2 questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Does ordinary physical activity (i.e. walking to the device clinic, grocery shopping,&#xD;
           etc.) cause palpitation, fatigue, shortness of breath or chest pain? (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Have you been admitted to the hospital for heart failure in the past year? (yes/no)&#xD;
&#xD;
      If patient has answered no to both questions of the survey they will be classified as NYHA I,&#xD;
      all others will be classified as NYHA II or greater. Medication lists will be updated for all&#xD;
      patients by the device clinic nurse in EPIC. Blood pressure and pulse will also be documented&#xD;
      in EPIC by the device clinic nurse for all in-person appointments. A clinical nurse or&#xD;
      physician assistant will review all patient visits for ICD and reduced EF at the UOHI device&#xD;
      clinic, patients not on GDMT (defined above) will have a letter sent to their cardiologist&#xD;
      with recommendations on medication change and required follow up. Those without a&#xD;
      cardiologist will be referred to the heart function clinic at UOHI or general hospital for&#xD;
      medication optimization. Patients will be categorized into 4 groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients on GDMT and at target dose (no action required)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Those on GDMT will continue on the same medication with no change. In patients with EF &lt;&#xD;
           40% at the time of ICD clinic visit, GDMT is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. NHYA I and ACE-I/ARB OR ARNI+BB+MRA+SGL2 or&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. NYHA II or above and on ARNI+BB+MRA+SGL2&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients that require up titration of medication. These patients have been identified as&#xD;
           NYHA II or above and they are not on the target dose of medication. A quality officer&#xD;
           reviews the answers to the questionnaire, their current medications, and if systolic&#xD;
           blood pressure &gt; 100 mmHg. a letter of will be sent to the pts cardiologist and a copy&#xD;
           will be given to the patient regarding medication optimization recommendation and&#xD;
           required follow up. Medication doses and required follow up will be detailed in the&#xD;
           letter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Patient requires a change in medication but has not cardiologist. A referral will be&#xD;
           made by the nurse or physician's assistant to the UOHI heart function clinic for&#xD;
           medication optimization for patients identified as NYHA II or above and require&#xD;
           initiation of ANRI, SGL2, BB, or MRA. Blood requisition will also be given to and&#xD;
           results will be sent to the referred MD. All patients who have their medication&#xD;
           increased or referred to have their medication switched and up titrated through the&#xD;
           heart function medication optimization clinic will have a letter sent to their care team&#xD;
           (cardiologist and family physician) informing them of the referral and change in&#xD;
           medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients already actively followed by the HF clinic will have an appointment made with&#xD;
           their HF cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Phase 3 (re-evaluation), patients will bring the letter from their cardiologist&#xD;
      stating the reason why they were not started on the recommended medication (i.e. renal&#xD;
      function, patient preference, urinary tract infection, low blood pressure, hyperkalemia&#xD;
      etc.). The medication use will be rated every 6 months through EPIC to assess for increase in&#xD;
      medication uptake. In addition, annually 35 (approximately 10% of the ICD implants) randomly&#xD;
      selected ICD patients with reduced ejection fraction from the device clinic will be assessed&#xD;
      regarding GDMT.&#xD;
