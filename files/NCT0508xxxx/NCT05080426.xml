  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of FSST 2.0 (family supportive supervisor training&#xD;
      plus support for use of family and sick leaves) using a randomized control trial design. We&#xD;
      expect the intervention will increase supervisors' family supportive and leave supportive&#xD;
      behaviors, which in turn will increase employees' leave use and decrease employees'&#xD;
      work-family conflict, emotional exhaustion, depressive symptoms, and turnover intentions.&#xD;
      This study will enroll a minimum of 200 managers and 1200 employees across 100 teams.&#xD;
      Managers in the intervention group will complete pre- and post-intervention Workplace&#xD;
      Assessments, 2 online training modules, 1 webinar. A small portion of the managers (8-10)&#xD;
      will participate in the focus group. Managers in the control group and employees in both&#xD;
      groups will complete pre- and post-intervention Workplace Assessments. The post-intervention&#xD;
      Workplace Assessment will be completed 6 months after the intervention. The total duration of&#xD;
      the study is 9 months as the wait list control group will be offered the intervention and&#xD;
      follow up survey after the 6 month trial.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the effectiveness of FSST 2.0 (family supportive supervisor training&#xD;
      plus support for use of family and sick leaves) using a randomized control trial design.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase of the Trial Based on the NIH's definition, the current study is a Phase III&#xD;
           clinical trial, which usually involves several hundred or more human subjects, for the&#xD;
           purpose of evaluating an experimental intervention in comparison with a standard or&#xD;
           controlled intervention or comparing two or more existing treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Type of trial - a randomized-control trial&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization strategy&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Randomization method The current study employs a cluster randomization strategy to&#xD;
                assign organizations to either Condition A (intervention group) or Condition B&#xD;
                (control group) for a few key reasons. First, although only the supervisors will&#xD;
                receive the training, the effectiveness of the training will be assessed at their&#xD;
                employees' levels, thereby needing a nested data structure. Second, cluster&#xD;
                randomization is effective in reducing contamination (Puffer et al., 2005). Third,&#xD;
                when the intervention is offered at a team level, cluster randomization increases&#xD;
                the external validity of the results (Donner &amp; Klar, 2000). Within each&#xD;
                organization, we will use a balanced group randomization strategy such that there&#xD;
                will be an equal number of workgroups/teams/departments in the intervention or&#xD;
                control condition. In the event that there is an odd number of such units, a slight&#xD;
                imbalance (i.e., groups per condition) will be off by one group, which has minimal&#xD;
                impact on statistical power to detect intervention effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Unit of randomization - organization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Allocation ratio - the same number of teams (one supervisor and at least 6&#xD;
                employees) will be recruited in both organization&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Timing of randomization - before the baseline assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The statistician of the study will generate and implement the randomization schema.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Specification of the number of study groups/arms - 2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Duration of the study intervention - 9 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up period - 6 and 9 months after the intervention&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A single site trial - the Purdue University team will implement the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Name and brief description of study intervention FSST 2.0 is a workplace intervention&#xD;
           package designed to increase supervisors' family and leave supportive behaviors and&#xD;
           leave supportive behaviors. The package includes Workplace Assessment tool, 2&#xD;
           30-45-minute online training modules (family-supportive supervisor training and&#xD;
           supervisors' leave supportive behavior training), a webinar, behavior training, and&#xD;
           individualized feedback reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control group The current trial employs a wait-list control group, &quot;whereby participants&#xD;
           will receive the usual care and will later receive the intervention in addition to the&#xD;
           usual care&quot; (Kinser &amp; Robins, 2013, p.2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One or more organization will be randomly assigned to receive the intervention and the other&#xD;
      organization(s) will serve as a wait-list control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mangers in the intervention group will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Complete a baseline online survey. 2. Take the Family Supportive Supervisor Training&#xD;
      online (FSST). 3. Take the Supervisor Support for Leave Use module training online. 4. Track&#xD;
      their behaviors for two weeks 5. Participate in a webinar 7. Complete up to 2 post-training&#xD;
      surveys. 8. 8-10 managers will participate in the focus group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Employees in the control group and employees in both groups will be asked to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. Complete an online survey twice over the course of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The wait list control group will be offered the training after the 6 months trial is over&#xD;
      with a follow up survey.&#xD;
