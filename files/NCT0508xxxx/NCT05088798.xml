  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to provide access to 18F-DOPA PET to patients at Washington&#xD;
      University and assess the utility of 18F-DOPA PET/MRI as a preoperative tool to detect and&#xD;
      localize focal lesions in the pancreas that are causing hyperinsulinism.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorder that&#xD;
      is the most common cause of permanent hypoglycemia in infants and children. More than 50% of&#xD;
      the medically-unresponsive patients have focal disease. Which is characterized by a distinct&#xD;
      region of Beta-cell hyperplasia in the pancreas, due to a somatic loss of a gene that&#xD;
      regulates cell proliferation. Resection of the involved region cures most cases of focal HI.&#xD;
      Therefore, preoperative identification and localization of focal HI lesions is useful for&#xD;
      diagnostic confirmation and surgical guidance of patients with HI that fail pharmacological&#xD;
      therapy and are being considered for surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insulinomas are benign insulin secreting neuroendocrine neoplasms located in the pancreas.&#xD;
      They are the most common cause of endogenous hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia in adults.&#xD;
      Approximately 90% are solitary, benign and &lt; 2cm in diameter and therefore represent a&#xD;
      challenge to localize. The small size of insulinomas makes detection by conventional imaging&#xD;
      techniques such as contrast-enhanced CT (ceCT) and contrast-enhanced MRI challenging. As&#xD;
      surgery appears to be the only available treatment option, it remains very critical to&#xD;
      localize the tumor to facilitate pancreas preserving surgery. Endoscopic ultrasound is well&#xD;
      established in the detection of insulinomas. However, this technique is operator dependent,&#xD;
      invasive, and the visualization of the pancreas tail is not always possible. Therefore better&#xD;
      imaging techniques to detect these lesions are needed for surgical planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Though not FDA approved, noninvasive imaging with 18F-fluoro-L-DOPA (FDOPA) is considered an&#xD;
      integral part of standards of care management to identify focal lesions in CHI and&#xD;
      potentially insulinomas. This is based on the fact that 18F-DOPA is selectively taken up by&#xD;
      neuroendocrine cells, and thus, in focal HI, dense collections of endocrine cells can be&#xD;
      visualized by an experienced radiologist. This study aims to determine if using combined&#xD;
      positron emission tomography and magnetic resonance imaging will better localize the lesions&#xD;
      and help the investigators determine which areas of the pancreas are affected, and assist&#xD;
      with the surgical plan.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with confirmed hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia, diagnosed by elevated insulin&#xD;
             levels during hypoglycemia and/or response to glucagon stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects who failed pharmacological therapy with diazoxide or octreotide.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with signed informed consent by themselves or their parents or legal&#xD;
             guardians.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patient's Endocrinologist has determined that the patient cannot be safely managed&#xD;
             with standard medical therapy (failed) and surgery is recommended to prevent future&#xD;
             episodes of severe hypoglycemia and preserve brain function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any other major illness or condition that in the investigator's judgment will&#xD;
             substantially increase the risk associated with the subject's participation in this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient must not have any contraindication to MRI as evaluated by a standardized MRI&#xD;
             safety questionnaire. If MRI is contraindicated, and patient meets inclusion criteria&#xD;
             and has no other contraindications study will be conducted in PET/CT scanner.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Cases in which surgery will not be considered by parents or guardians.&#xD;
