  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A total of 68 adult and pediatric patients who suffer from at least one discrete partial&#xD;
      thickness thermal burn wound (Grade II) will be recruited. Subjects will be randomized (1:1)&#xD;
      to either PermeaDerm® or Mepilex Ag®. Evaluations will occur at 7, 14 and 21 days with long&#xD;
      term follow-up at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 68 adult and pediatric patients who suffer from at least one discrete partial&#xD;
      thickness thermal burn wound (Grade II) will be recruited from the clinical practices of the&#xD;
      site Principal Investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and/or the Legally Authorized Representative (LAR) as appropriate will be fully&#xD;
      informed regarding the conduct of the clinical trial including all potential risks and&#xD;
      benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Participants must be consented, randomized (1:1) and treated within 72 hours of injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is permissible for a Study Participant to be enrolled if they have more than one burn&#xD;
      wound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If more than one partial thickness burn is treated, the Investigator must indicate prior to&#xD;
      randomization which wound is to be considered for primary analysis. This wound will be called&#xD;
      the Primary Wound and is to be evaluated by a Blinded Assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional partial thickness wounds must be treated with the same product to which the Study&#xD;
      Participant was randomized and will be included in secondary analysis. These wounds are to be&#xD;
      described as Secondary Wounds and are to be evaluated by the Unblinded Assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations will occur at 7, 14 and 21 days with long term follow-up at 6 and 12 months.&#xD;
