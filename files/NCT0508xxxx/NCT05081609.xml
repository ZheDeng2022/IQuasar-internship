  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TransCon IL-2 β/γ is an investigational drug being developed for treatment of locally&#xD;
      advanced or metastatic solid tumors. This is a first-in-human, open-label, Phase 1/2, dose&#xD;
      escalation and dose expansion study of TransCon IL-2 β/γ as monotherapy or in combination&#xD;
      therapy in adult participants with advanced or metastatic solid tumors. Given the unique PK&#xD;
      profile enabled by the TransCon technology, TransCon IL-2 β/γ presents the opportunity to&#xD;
      enhance the therapeutic index of current IL-2 therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IL-2 is a key cytokine that directs the immune system through pleiotropic effects mediated by&#xD;
      promoting expansion of both cytotoxic effector cells and Tregs. TransCon IL-2 β/γ is designed&#xD;
      as a long-acting delivery prodrug of IL-2 β/γ, a potent cytokine signaling molecule, with the&#xD;
      potential to improve the safety and efficacy of IL-2.&#xD;
