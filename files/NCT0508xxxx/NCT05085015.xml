      The subject of the research; Effects of exercise training on cardiometabolic risk factors and&#xD;
      functional capacity in individuals undergoing bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose of the research; Cardiometabolic risk factors, body composition, muscle strength and&#xD;
      endurance, posture, foot sense, physical exercise capacity, balance, pain, exercise benefits&#xD;
      - barriers, exercise self-efficacy, exercise beliefs, to evaluate the effects on body esteem,&#xD;
      body image and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of Research:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical interventions are important in individuals who have undergone bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Intervention programs that include exercise, encourage the change in the lifestyle&#xD;
      of individuals, effectively and accurately reduce post-surgical obesity. Functional Exercise&#xD;
      Training, which can also be used for obesity treatment, consists of stretching, aerobics,&#xD;
      strengthening and balance training. Therefore, it has a positive effect on body systems. In&#xD;
      addition, Home Exercise Training can be used within the scope of obesity treatment. Exercise&#xD;
      is one of the alternative methods by providing the adaptation of the individual to the&#xD;
      exercise. Socio-demographic and physical characteristics of individuals will be recorded.&#xD;
      Laboratory tests will be ordered for cardiometabolic risk factors. Body composition will be&#xD;
      determined by Tanita brand body analysis monitor (MC-780MA). Posture will be evaluated by&#xD;
      photogrammetry technique. Muscle strength assessment will be evaluated by leg, back and hand&#xD;
      dynamometer instrument, muscle endurance tests, sensory assessment by foot sense assessment,&#xD;
      physical capacity with physical exercise capacity tests, balance static and dynamic balance&#xD;
      tests and pain questionnaire. Exercise benefits-barriers will be assessed by Exercise&#xD;
      Benefits Barriers Scale, exercise self-efficacy by Exercise Self-Efficacy Scale. Exercise&#xD;
      beliefs will also be questioned with a questionnaire. Self-esteem will be evaluated for all&#xD;
      groups before and after treatment. The self respect will be evaluated by using the Rosenberg&#xD;
      Self-Esteem Scale, body image with the Body Image Scale, with the quality of life using the&#xD;
      Obesity-Specific Quality of Life Scale.The training will be carried out 3 days a week for 8&#xD;
      weeks, approximately 1 hour. Sufficient number of assessments and exercises will be used for&#xD;
      individuals to become familiar with the equipment and training protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is defined as abnormal or excessive fat accumulation in the body to the extent that&#xD;
      it disrupts health. The prevalence of obesity is increasing day by day in developed and&#xD;
      developing countries. While 600 million of the world population were obese in 2014, this&#xD;
      situation reached 700 million in 2015, and when the trend continues in the same way, it is&#xD;
      thought that more than 3 billion people will have overweight or obesity in 2030. Therefore,&#xD;
      the worldwide prevalence of morbid obesity will increase rapidly. Obesity is a risk factor&#xD;
      especially for cardiovascular disease and causes an increase in mortality and morbidity with&#xD;
      the central accumulation of adipose tissues. It affects the muscle, liver, subcutaneous and&#xD;
      intra-abdominal regions, especially due to intraabdominal and / or visceral fat. As a result,&#xD;
      cardiometabolic complications occur, as it causes physical inactivity, muscle strength and&#xD;
      endurance are affected, posture is affected, physical performance is affected, self-esteem,&#xD;
      body image, health-related quality of life and exercise avoidance occur. It has been reported&#xD;
      that approximately 91% of obese individuals complain of musculoskeletal pain, 69% of them&#xD;
      have back pain and 58% have knee pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the literature is examined, it is seen that conservative therapies such as nutrition,&#xD;
      exercise and drug management are used intensively in the treatment of obesity, more invasive&#xD;
      methods are more prominent today and bariatric surgery is preferred by many people. Studies&#xD;
      emphasize that non-surgical methods fail to achieve permanent success compared to surgical&#xD;
      methods. Obese individuals undergoing bariatric surgery have reported a large diet history&#xD;
      that failed to stop weight gain, starting in adolescence. It has been reported that obese&#xD;
      individuals experience higher levels of symptoms such as stress, anxiety, depression, food&#xD;
      cravings and psychological effects such as lower self-esteem compared to normal weight&#xD;
      individuals, and this situation continuously increases weight gain. For this reason,&#xD;
      bariatric surgery has become increasingly common in the fight for effective weight loss. The&#xD;
      postoperative process in which exercise and lifestyle changes are adopted after bariatric&#xD;
      surgery is important. With the prominence of bariatric surgery in the studies performed, if&#xD;
      weight loss management is not planned well after surgery, weight gain and complications occur&#xD;
      after surgery, and it is seen that the effect of the surgery performed decreases. Weight&#xD;
      recovery in this population also increases the likelihood of the return of obesity-related&#xD;
      comorbidities. Insufficient physical activity and inadequate nutritional support after&#xD;
      surgery cause sarcopenia. Therefore, it is an important anabolic stimulant for the prevention&#xD;
      of muscle protein synthesis and sarcopenia formation, together with adequate nutritional&#xD;
      support, together with early physical activity after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing physical activity, exercise and lifestyle changes are important in maintaining the&#xD;
      weight given during the postoperative period, reducing muscle loss and increasing fat&#xD;
      burning. The purposes of exercise training given in the post-surgery period in obese&#xD;
      individuals are to increase body fat mass loss, protect muscle mass, and improve physical and&#xD;
      mental health. Although there are studies in which exercise training is important following&#xD;
      bariatric surgery, there is insufficient evidence regarding the interventions of different&#xD;
      exercise protocols. Finding the best exercise protocols, increasing body fat mass loss and&#xD;
      preserving muscle mass is important as part of the post-surgical guideline. Studies have&#xD;
      reported that physical exercise is a positive predictor of outcome after bariatric surgery.&#xD;
      Intervention programs that include exercise are reported to effectively reduce obesity and&#xD;
      comorbidity by encouraging individuals to change their lifestyle after such surgery. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that exercise is considered an effective mediator for correcting insulin&#xD;
      resistance, effectively reduces indicators of obesity such as body mass index (BMI) and body&#xD;
      fat percentage, and reduced risk factors for cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, the main&#xD;
      purpose of the study is to evaluate the effects of exercise training on cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors and functional capacity in individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery. There is&#xD;
      no such exercise protocol study conducted in Cyprus. The investigators are of the opinion&#xD;
      that the research is an interesting study in this respect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional Exercise Training is a type of exercise that includes training for stretching,&#xD;
      aerobics, strengthening and balance. Studies on obese individuals have reported a positive&#xD;
      effect on body composition, functional capacity and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Home Exercise Training, on the other hand, is one of the alternative methods of exercise that&#xD;
      maximizes the sustainability of behavioral change by providing adaptation to exercise&#xD;
      throughout life. It is an option that will increase an individual's physical activity&#xD;
      compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence regarding the effectiveness of Functional Exercise Training and Home Exercise&#xD;
      Training in Individuals Undergoing Bariatric Surgery is insufficient and it is necessary to&#xD;
      know and clarify the differences create. It is necessary to clarify whether individuals&#xD;
      continue the exercise in their daily lives and whether the continuity of the effects of the&#xD;
      exercise should be addressed. In this context, the content and effects of the exercise&#xD;
      programs to be applied to individuals who have undergone bariatric surgery are important in&#xD;
      Cyprus for future multifactorial situations and may guide individuals.&#xD;
