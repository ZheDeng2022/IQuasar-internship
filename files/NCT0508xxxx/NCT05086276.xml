      This is a Phase 2, prospective, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose,&#xD;
      multicenter study to evaluate the efficacy of FX-322, administered by intratympanic&#xD;
      injection, in adults with acquired sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous human studies in subjects 18 to 65 years inclusive (FX-322-103, FX-322-201,&#xD;
      FX-322-111) and subjects 66-85 inclusive (FX-322-112) demonstrated that a single dose FX-322&#xD;
      was well tolerated in patients with acquired SNHL with no treatment-related serious adverse&#xD;
      events. Adverse events in these studies were generally common to and associated with the&#xD;
      intratympanic injection procedure with mild and transient discomfort in patients both with&#xD;
      the drug and the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Frequency Therapeutics' Investigators intend to evaluate efficacy with a single dose of&#xD;
      FX-322 in subjects 18 to 65 years inclusive with acquired SNHL.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Documented medical history consistent with acquired, adult onset, sensorineural&#xD;
             hearing loss associated with noise-induced SNHL (NIHL) or idiopathic sudden SNHL&#xD;
             (SSNHL) (documented audiogram at least 6 months prior to screening required).&#xD;
&#xD;
