  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, prospective and controlled clinical trial which will enroll 200&#xD;
      coronary arteriography or percutaneous coronary intervention with 2-4 interventional&#xD;
      cardiologist. The interventional cardiologist performed 100 interventional procedures using&#xD;
      either a new protective device (NPD) or a traditional lead clothing (TLC). The cumulative&#xD;
      dose outside the NPD or TLC and the first operator at each height (110cm, 90cm, 50cm, 10cm)&#xD;
      was measured. The main indicators of the study are the average X-ray shielding efficiency of&#xD;
      the NPD and the TLC at four different heights. The investigators will record all operation&#xD;
      information in this study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the investigators developed a new protection device (NPD) and compared its&#xD;
      effects on the reduction of radiation exposure compared with the traditional lead clothing&#xD;
      (TLC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The NPD (WLXP-006, Yingnuoweite Medical Science and Technology, Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China) is&#xD;
      a floor-standing medical radiation protection device mainly composed of a barrel-like frame&#xD;
      and protective lead rubber (0.5 mm lead equivalent).&#xD;
