  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare self-help lifestyle medicine (LM) delivered by a smartphone app&#xD;
      and booklets in managing depressive symptoms in a Chinese population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a randomised controlled trial. First, informed consent will be obtained from&#xD;
      potential participants. Around 90 eligible participants will be randomly assigned to either&#xD;
      the LM app group, the LM booklet group, and the waitlist control group, in a ratio of 1:1:1.&#xD;
      The app group will receive an app to facilitate lifestyle modification such as video&#xD;
      demonstrations of physical activity, diet recommendations, stress and sleep management. The&#xD;
      booklet group will receive 8 LM booklets with identical content with the LM app. The waitlist&#xD;
      control group will receive access to the app and booklets at the end of the study. The whole&#xD;
      intervention lasts 8 weeks. Participants will also receive 2 messages per week from the&#xD;
      researcher to check and prompt motivation and adherence. Participants will complete&#xD;
      assessment before, immediately after intervention, at one month and 12-week follow up.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As lifestyle plays an important role in the pathogenesis of depression, lifestyle medicine&#xD;
      (LM) emerges as a new way to alleviate depressive symptoms (Sarris &amp; O'Neil, 2016). Booklets&#xD;
      have been shown as an inexpensive and effective delivery modality of lifestyle modification&#xD;
      among individuals with physical conditions (Wong, Chair &amp; Wong, 2017). Meanwhile, a recent&#xD;
      meta-analysis supports the efficacy of mobile applications in improving depressive symptoms&#xD;
      (Linardon, Cujipers, Carlbring, Messer &amp; Fuller-Tyszkiewicz, 2019). Notably, the efficacy of&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention using booklets and app have not been compared. This pilot study can&#xD;
      inform the field about the efficacy of lifestyle intervention using two self-help delivery&#xD;
      modalities and offer new ways to better managing depressive symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomised controlled trial comparing self-help LM delivered by a&#xD;
      smartphone app and booklets in improving depression. For a pilot study, a sample size of 12&#xD;
      per group is recommended (Julious, 2005). Considering an estimation of 20% attrition at the&#xD;
      three assessment time points, the final sample size is 90, with 30 participants in each&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LM booklet group will receive a pocket size 6-page booklet weekly that covers 8 lifestyle&#xD;
      medicine themes including stress, relaxation, diet, exercise, sleep hygiene, worry&#xD;
      management, mindfulness, and positive psychology. Exercises based on cognitive behavioural&#xD;
      therapy and guidance to set and meet short term and long-term goals are featured in the&#xD;
      booklets. The booklet series is reviewed by a panel of experts including clinical&#xD;
      psychologists, psychiatrists, dietitians, physical trainers, and traditional Chinese Medicine&#xD;
      practitioners. The app group will receive access to a mobile app that offers 8 modules with&#xD;
      identical content as the wellness booklets, in addition to videos, relaxation, exercise and&#xD;
      cooking demonstrations, daily challenges and record of goals. The waitlist control group will&#xD;
      receive access to the app and booklets at the end of the study.&#xD;
