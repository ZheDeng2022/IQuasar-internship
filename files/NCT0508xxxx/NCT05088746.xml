    <textblock>
      This is a prospective cohort study describing the difference in terms of percentage of closed&#xD;
      pockets (PPD &lt;5 mm and no BOP) when performing the periodontal re-evaluation at 3-4, 6-8 or&#xD;
      12 months. The trial will follow the recommendations of the Consolidated Standards of&#xD;
      Reporting Trials (CONSORT) statement. The study consists of 7 visits over a period of 15&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 - Baseline -&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Informed consent, medical/dental history and demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record concomitant medications and smoking history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Periodontal assessment by a blind and calibrated examiner, consisting of full mouth PPD,&#xD;
           REC, BOP, PI, mobility and furcation involvement. PPD, REC, PI and BOP will be recorded&#xD;
           at 6 sites per tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standardized peri-apical x-rays for the sites with PPD≥5mm, as per standard of practice&#xD;
           (if not already available within the previous 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intra-oral 3D scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Oral hygiene instructions and demonstration of self-performed oral hygiene measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMs questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Saliva collection and GCF collection from the deepest pockets (maximum of 5 sites)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2 and 3 - NSPT - (and extra visit 3.1 and 3.2 if needed) (within 60 days from baseline)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Update medical/dental history and record adverse events and/or concomitant medications&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  NSPT, consisting in the careful removal of hard and soft deposits with ultrasonic&#xD;
           instruments at infected sites performed by an experienced clinician following the&#xD;
           principles of minimally invasive non-surgical therapy (MINST). A quadrant approach will&#xD;
           be adopted and it will be left to the discretion of the clinician to choose whether to&#xD;
           instrument 1 or 2 quadrants at a time and the length of session visits. Hence, 2 to 4&#xD;
           sessions of NSPT with an interval of 1 week between each other will be performed. During&#xD;
           NSPT, teeth considered hopeless will be extracted as per standard of practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reinforcement of oral hygiene instructions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PROMs questionnaires&#xD;

This means that we are responsible for looking after patient information and using it properly. We will keep identifiable information for 20 years after the study has finished.&#xD;
The only people within the Centro di Odontoiatria who will have access to information that identifies the patients will be people who need to contact them about the research study, and make sure that relevant information about the study is recorded for their care, and to oversee the quality of the study or audit the data collection process. The people who analyse the information will not be able to identify patients and will not be able to find out their name or contact details.</ipd_description>
