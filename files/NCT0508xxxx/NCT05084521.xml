  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether oral famotidine, a histamine type 2&#xD;
      receptor antagonist already widely used with very few side effects in other indications in&#xD;
      children, is effective in reducing endothelial expression of P-selectin in children with&#xD;
      sickle cell disease (SCD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This pilot study will constitute the essential prerequisite for a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing the efficacy of famotidine with that of placebo in the prevention of vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      crises in SCD patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a frequent and severe hemoglobinopathy, considered the first&#xD;
      monogenic disease in the world. It is responsible for chronic hemolytic anemia, painful&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crises secondary to obstruction of the microcirculation by sickled red blood&#xD;
      cells adhering to the vascular endothelium, and progressive organ damage secondary to&#xD;
      ischemia/reperfusion phenomena.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the molecular bases are well known, the pathophysiology is still incompletely&#xD;
      understood and therapeutic options remain limited. We have recently demonstrated an increase&#xD;
      in plasma histamine levels (associated with mast cell activation) in SCD patients,&#xD;
      particularly ≤ 18 years of age, at baseline and even more markedly during vaso-occlusive&#xD;
      crises (Allali, Br J Haematol 2019). In vitro, an increase in the adhesion of red blood cells&#xD;
      of SCD patients to human endothelial cells after stimulation with histamine has been&#xD;
      described, via an increased expression of the adhesion molecule P-selectin. Abolition of this&#xD;
      effect in the presence of famotidine, a histamine type 2 (H2) receptor antagonist, suggests&#xD;
      that histamine is responsible for an increased adhesion mediated by P-selectin via&#xD;
      stimulation of the H2 receptors. Therefore, our hypothesis is that long-term use of oral&#xD;
      antihistamine therapy with famotidine may prevent vaso-occlusion by decreasing P-selectin&#xD;
      expression by endothelial cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to assess the effect of famotidine on P-selectin&#xD;
      expression after 29 days of oral treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the effect of famotidine on the expression of other endothelial activation&#xD;
           markers after 29 days of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the effect of famotidine on biomarkers of hemolysis and inflammation after 29&#xD;
           days of treatment;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the adverse effects of famotidine in a pediatric population suffering from&#xD;
           sickle cell disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The experimental design will be a monocentric, prospective, non-comparative, pilot cohort&#xD;
      study. The population studied will be that of children aged 1 to 17 years and 10 months,&#xD;
      followed at the Necker-Enfants malades hospital for SS or Sβ0 SCD and having presented at&#xD;
      least one vaso-occlusive crisis during the year prior to inclusion. All the children included&#xD;
      will be treated for 29 days with famotidine in oral suspension, at a dosage of 0.5 mg/kg/12h&#xD;
      (with a maximum dose of 80 mg/day, regardless of the patient's weight). Patient recruitment&#xD;
      will take place in the General Pediatrics and Infectious Diseases department/SCD Center of&#xD;
      the Necker-Enfants malades Hospital in consultation or during hospitalization. The selection&#xD;
      visit will take place 3 months before the inclusion visit and the research itself will&#xD;
      comprise 3 visits (D0, D29 and D36/End of study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment will be started on D1, in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the inclusion visit will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  verification of inclusion and non-inclusion criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  obtention of the consent of the 2 parents/legal representative(s) and of the child;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a complete clinical examination;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a biological assessment including a plasma assay of P-selectin, E-selectin, VCAM-1 and&#xD;
           ICAM-1 by ELISA technique, in the research laboratory of Prof. Olivier Hermine (Imagine&#xD;
           Institute), and examinations carried out as part of the usual follow-up for SCD children&#xD;
           in the routine laboratories of the Necker-Enfants malades hospital: complete blood&#xD;
           count, reticulocyte count, C-reactive protein, serum urea, creatinine, and electrolytes,&#xD;
           aspartate and alanine aminotransferase, total and direct bilirubin, gamma-glutamyl&#xD;
           transferase, lactate dehydrogenase, and hemoglobin S/F. A plasma histamine assay will&#xD;
           also be carried out in the immunology laboratory of the Bichat-Claude Bernard hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the follow-up visit at D29, will be carried out:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a questioning on possible symptoms (pain, headache, feeling of dizziness, transit&#xD;
           disorders, etc.) and on adherence to treatment since the inclusion visit (using a&#xD;
           logbook for monitoring tolerance and compliance);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a complete clinical examination identical to that of the inclusion visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a biological assessment identical to that carried out during the inclusion visit (except&#xD;
           for HbS/F assay which will not be performed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Famotidine treatment will be discontinued at the end of this research visit. A phone call is&#xD;
      scheduled 7 days after stopping treatment to monitor the occurrence of adverse events (i.e.&#xD;
      on D36) and will correspond to the end of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various visits will be carried out by the principal investigator or by his collaborators&#xD;
      (registered pediatricians and trained in research from the General Pediatrics and Infectious&#xD;
      Diseases Department/SCD Center).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients to be included will be 30, or 2 to 3 patients/month for 12 months. The&#xD;
      total duration of the research will be 13 months and 1 week:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  selection period: 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of inclusion: 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of participation (treatment + follow-up): 29 + 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of treatment: 29 days (between 26 and 29 days)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study of the effect of famotidine on the expression of P-selectin in children with SCD&#xD;
      will constitute the essential prerequisite for the performance of a randomized clinical trial&#xD;
      comparing the efficacy of famotidine with that of a placebo in the prevention of&#xD;
      vaso-occlusive crises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral antihistamine treatment with famotidine, which is already widely used with very few side&#xD;
      effects in other indications in children, may constitute an inexpensive, original and&#xD;
      innovative therapeutic approach in SCD.&#xD;
