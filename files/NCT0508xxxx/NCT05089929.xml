    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to investigate the use of FLIP topography in patients undergoing&#xD;
      evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). This device allows the clinician to&#xD;
      measure muscle activity in the esophagus during a routine upper endoscopy. The FLIP&#xD;
      topography will be used to help detect movement disorders in the esophagus, and to examine&#xD;
      differences in patient satisfaction between FLIP topography and the standard of care&#xD;
      procedure, high resolution manometry (HRM).&#xD;

      The goal of the proposed research is to evaluate the endoscopic esophageal functional luminal&#xD;
      imaging probe (FLIP) with topography (EndoflipÂ® 2.0, Medtronic, USA) as a pre-operative&#xD;
      diagnostic test to rule out significant esophageal dysmotility in patients with&#xD;
      gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). Currently, the gold standard for pre-operative&#xD;
      motility assessment is high resolution manometry (HRM), a trans-nasal catheter test performed&#xD;
      in an awake patient that can be quite uncomfortable, and some patients cannot tolerate.1&#xD;
      Conversely, Endoflip can provide similar data in a sedated patient at the time of upper&#xD;
      endoscopy, limiting discomfort and streamlining workup. While Endoflip has been used as a&#xD;
      complimentary tool for clinical decision making in major motility disorders, its evaluation&#xD;
      as a potential stand-alone pre-operative test in the GERD population has been limited.&#xD;
      However, if FLIP topography reliably excludes major motility disorders, patients could&#xD;
      proceed with fundoplication without undergoing the additional burden of high resolution&#xD;
      manometry (HRM) testing. Unfortunately, as of now, there are insufficient data available to&#xD;
      justify a change in clinical practice. As a result, FLIP topography has remained relegated to&#xD;
      a purely complimentary role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate this question, the investigators will perform FLIP topography (Endoflip 2.0)&#xD;
      analysis on all patients undergoing routine evaluation for gastroesophageal reflux disease at&#xD;
      the time of their pre-operative EGD. Those patients with repetitive antegrade contractions&#xD;
      (RACs) on FLIP topography will be classified as having normal motility, while any other&#xD;
      pattern will be considered abnormal. All patients will additionally complete a standard&#xD;
      pre-operative reflux evaluation including HRM, Upper GI series (UGI), 48-hour wireless pH&#xD;
      testing, and baseline GERD quality of life surveys. The investigators will then compare the&#xD;
      results of the FLIP topography measurements to the results of the gold standard&#xD;
      high-resolution manometry (HRM) in terms of the ability of the FLIP topography to&#xD;
      differentiate between normal and impaired esophageal function in GERD patients. Subjects will&#xD;
      then be followed through their anti-reflux operations and post-operative outcomes will be&#xD;
      tracked with standardized symptom questionnaires at 1, 2 and 6 months post-operatively to&#xD;
      evaluate for post-operative dysphagia and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that FLIP topography (Endoflip 2.0) in GERD patients will&#xD;
      reliably identify individuals with normal motility, which will predict good outcomes after&#xD;
      anti-reflux surgery. If this proves to be the case, formal high resolution manometry (HRM)&#xD;
      testing would not be necessary prior to proceeding with fundoplication, allowing a paradigm&#xD;
      shift in the pre-operative workup of this large population of patients.&#xD;
