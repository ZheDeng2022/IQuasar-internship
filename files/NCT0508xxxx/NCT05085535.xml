  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research project is part of the process of generating scientific evidence, on whether&#xD;
      the clinical results obtained, in the treatment of the consequences of aging on mobility,&#xD;
      pain and disability, are better if therapeutic exercise programs are added sessions of manual&#xD;
      therapy and training in pain awareness, or on the contrary, do not significantly modify the&#xD;
      effect of exercise programs.&#xD;

      General objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Find out if adding Manual Therapy (MT) sessions to therapeutic exercise programs increases&#xD;
      the efficacy of clinical results for the treatment of ailments derived from aging in older&#xD;
      adults (65 &lt;age &lt;85).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the effects on pain. (hypothesis: MT improves pain outcomes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Assess the effects on physical disability. (hypothesis: MT improves results regarding&#xD;
           physical disability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess the effects on mental disability. (hypothesis: MT improves results regarding&#xD;
           mental disability)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess the effects on the prevention of falls (hypothesis: MT improves the results&#xD;
           regarding the risk of falls)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: It is a study of the randomized clinical trial type, with triple blind.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selection of participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. General criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The sample will be selected from the patients who volunteer to participate in the study,&#xD;
           which will be announced by the media (Radio and / or TV) and meet the inclusion criteria&#xD;
           and not the exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be treated by different therapists, who will be instructed in the&#xD;
           treatments to be performed on the participants, to eliminate the therapist's personal&#xD;
           factor as a contaminating variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be referred to the physiotherapist according to the group assigned by&#xD;
           the randomization process, which will be unknown by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the sample size, the EPIDAT 4.2 or GRANMO 7.12 computer program will be used,&#xD;
      depending on the population and epidemiological data of the Catalunya area, of older adults,&#xD;
      with disabilities and mechanical-degenerative pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the calculation is made based on a Student's t test for independent data, accepting an&#xD;
      alpha risk of 0.05 and a beta risk of 0.20 in a bilateral contrast, 25 subjects would be&#xD;
      required in each group to detect a minimum difference of 20 percentage points. between two&#xD;
      groups, assuming a common standard deviation of 25 points, and a loss to follow-up rate of&#xD;
      0%, following the usual criteria of biostatistics in health sciences (1) and the criteria of&#xD;
      minimal differences between groups previously used in similar pilot studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of loss of subjects in the sample, participants should be replaced by others to&#xD;
      maintain proportions. The definitive calculations will be made with more precision after the&#xD;
      epidemiological study mentioned above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Of all the participants who meet the inclusion criteria and do not have any&#xD;
      exclusion criteria, a number will be assigned, after being randomized through a computerized&#xD;
      process, to distribute each number to the corresponding group. The patient will not know&#xD;
      which group he has been assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analytical procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis by computer processing with SPSS 22.0 Â® program. Performed by a blinded computer&#xD;
      analyst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ethical aspects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, national and international guidelines (code of ethics, Declaration of&#xD;
      Helsinki) will be followed, as well as the legal regulations on data confidentiality (Organic&#xD;
      Law 3/2018 of December 5 on the Protection of Personal Data and guarantee of digital rights&#xD;
      -LOPD-).&#xD;
