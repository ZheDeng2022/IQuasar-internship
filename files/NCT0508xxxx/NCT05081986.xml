  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a modality for probing and altering&#xD;
      brain function in humans non-invasively. The technology relies on the principles of&#xD;
      electromagnetic induction, whereby magnetic fields have an associated electrical field. By&#xD;
      intersecting two magnetic fields safely generated outside the head, one can induce a focal&#xD;
      electrical current where the magnetic fields intersect in the brain, and this can depolarize&#xD;
      cell membranes and impact brain activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A well investigated phenomenon in neuroscience is the principle of long term potentiation&#xD;
      (LTP), and its converse long term depression (LTD), referring to the ability of neurons to&#xD;
      increase or decrease their connection strength in an activity dependent manner. They do this&#xD;
      through modifications to their electrochemical junctions, the synapses. We have previously&#xD;
      used the motor system as a model system to study the impact D-Cycloserine, an NMDA receptor&#xD;
      partial agonist, on synaptic plasticity after TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conventional therapeutic TMS is delivered once daily, however it is increasingly being&#xD;
      delivered multiple times per day in an effort to speed treatment effects. It is unclear how&#xD;
      adjunctive agents would impact these repeated stimulation designs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Does the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor partial agonist D-Cycloserine stabilize motor&#xD;
      plasticity across multiple daily sessions of TMS?&#xD;

      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To recruit 20 participants into a cross-over trial. These participants will complete two&#xD;
           study phases (active and placebo), and will not know whether they are taking a low-dose&#xD;
           d-cycloserine capsule (100mg) or a placebo capsule at each of these phases.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To measure motor evoked potentials (MEP) in the hand in relation to magnetic stimulation&#xD;
           of the motor cortex responsible for this muscle. These will be measured at baseline, and&#xD;
           after receiving rTMS over the motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To deliver intermittent theta-burst rTMS stimulation (TBS) to the FDI region of the&#xD;
           motor cortex.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To measure the magnitude (and associated change from baseline) of the MEPs after rTMS at&#xD;
           a fixed stimulus intensity, and using a range of stimuli to generate a stimulus response&#xD;
           curve.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To repeat iTBS one hour later and measure the impact on MEPs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To measure changes in performance on computerized cognitive tasks following ingestion of&#xD;
           the blinded capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      D-Cycloserine will be purchased from Parsolex and repackaged into 100mg placebo-controlled&#xD;
      capsules by Script Pharmacy in Calgary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. We will recruit 20 participants aged 18-65 through community advertisement, carefully&#xD;
           screened for exclusion factors related to rTMS and DCS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participants will be randomly assigned by random number sequence with allocation&#xD;
           concealment to one of two first arms of the crossover study: a) placebo-DCS 100mg and b)&#xD;
           DCS 100mg-placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Participants will complete the QIDS-SR (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms-Self&#xD;
           Report), the BAI (Beck Anxiety Inventory), and the STAI (State Trait Anxiety Inventory).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Participants will take their blinded capsule at least 1 hour prior to TBS. (we&#xD;
           anticipate that it will take approximately 30 minutes to do steps 5-7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Electromyographic (EMG) electrodes will be positioned over the first dorsal interosseous&#xD;
           (FDI) bilaterally. These are non-invasive electrodes that use an adhesive to stick to&#xD;
           the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Using neuronavigation in conjunction with an atlas brain, the M1 hand strip will be&#xD;
           localized using single pulse TMS (MagPro X100).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Motor evoked potentials are measurements of muscle activation, in this case in response&#xD;
           to TMS stimulation of the brain. We will use single pulse TMS to record the magnitude of&#xD;
           responses. As a baseline, we will collect twenty single-pulse (120% resting motor&#xD;
           threshold (RMT), 0.25Hz) MEPs every 5 minutes for the 15 minutes preceding TBS rTMS. We&#xD;
           will also characterize the stimulus response curve at baseline by delivering single&#xD;
           pulse TMS at stimulus intensities ranging from 100-150% resting motor threshold&#xD;
           presented in random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. TBS rTMS will be applied to the FDI 'hotspot'. TBS consists of 2s trains every 10s.&#xD;
           Trains are composed of 3 pulses at 50Hz, 200ms intervals, 80% RMT. Total time 190s and&#xD;
           600 pulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. After TBS, twenty MEPs will be acquired (single pulse, 120% RMT, 0.25Hz) every 5 minutes&#xD;
           for the first 15 minutes after iTBS. A stimulus response curve will be acquired at 30&#xD;
           minutes and 60 minutes post iTBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. One hour following TBS, a second train of TBS rTMS will be applied to the FDI 'hotspot'.&#xD;
           TBS consists of 2s trains every 10s. Trains are composed of 3 pulses at 50Hz, 200ms&#xD;
           intervals, 80% RMT. Total time 190s and 600 pulses.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. After TBS, twenty MEPs will be acquired (single pulse, 120% RMT, 0.25Hz) every 5 minutes&#xD;
           for the first 15 minutes after iTBS. A stimulus response curve will be acquired at 30&#xD;
           minutes and 60 minutes post iTBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. During one of the breaks in the stimulation procedure, a brief, computerized&#xD;
           neurocognitive assessment will take place after ingestion of the blinded capsule.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. Participants will be asked if they believe they received the study medication or placebo&#xD;
           in this first phase of the crossover trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is study involves a crossover design, therefore after a minimum of 7 days the experiment&#xD;
      will be repeated with the second blinded capsule.&#xD;

    <description>Cognitive function will be assessed using the THINC-it brief cognitive assessment tool. THINC-it includes a summation of four objective cognitive tests and a subjective cognitive questionnaire.&#xD;
The fourth objective cognitive test is called &quot;Trails&quot; and is a version of the Trail Making Test part B (TMT-B). The subject is presented with numbers and letters in circles placed in random array on the screen. The subject must draw a line from one circle to the next in ascending order; however, s/he must alternate the circles with numbers in them and circles with letters in them (ie, 1-A-2-B-3-C etc). The TMT is a timed test and the goal is to complete the tests accurately and as quickly as possible.&#xD;
Total results from the THINC-it assessment indicate cognitive performance compared to healthy age-, sex- and education-matched individuals. Change between the two arms will be assessed.</description>
