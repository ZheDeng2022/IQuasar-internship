  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researcher from UNC Greensboro have partnered with Prevention Strategies and key stakeholders&#xD;
      from the Kingdom of Bahrain to conduct a study using the innovative, engineering-inspired&#xD;
      methodological approach, the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST), to optimize and&#xD;
      evaluate the Peaceful Coexistence and Anti-Extremism middle and high school curricula. No&#xD;
      other curriculum targeting tolerance and/or extremism has been optimized using the&#xD;
      state-of-the-art MOST methodology. The overall goal of the project is that the optimized&#xD;
      versions of Peaceful Coexistence and Anti-Extremism curricula will be used across the Kingdom&#xD;
      of Bahrain and translated for use in other countries to combat the spread of extremism and&#xD;
      intolerance. Additionally, the D.A.R.E. keepin' it REAL (kiR) and D.A.R.E. myPlaybook high&#xD;
      school programs will be evaluated as part of the Peaceful Coexistence and Anti-Extremism&#xD;
      evaluation.&#xD;
