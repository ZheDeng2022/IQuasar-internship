  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Muscular Dystrophies (MD) are a heterogeneous group of diseases characterised by muscle&#xD;
      wasting that lead to progressive loss of function. Although exercise training has been&#xD;
      traditionally neglected to these patients due to concerns regarding muscle damage, research&#xD;
      has shown that exercise therapy is safe and tolerable in this population and can lead to&#xD;
      potential gains in endurance and muscle strength, as well as other patient-reported outcomes&#xD;
      such as health-related quality of life.Therefore, in this study, the investigators aim to&#xD;
      examine the feasibility, tolerability and safety as well as the effects of a 12-week,&#xD;
      exercise-training program in patients with MD on functional capacity, muscle strength, and&#xD;
      health-related quality of life.&#xD;
