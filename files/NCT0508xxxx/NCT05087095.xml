    <textblock>
      To identify potential adaptations of the managing cancer and living meaningfully (CALM)&#xD;
      intervention that will be required for service members, Veterans, their beneficiaries, and&#xD;
      civilian cancer metastasis to the brain (bMET) populations.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The first study is a single-arm, mixed-methods, Phase IIa, proof-of-concept trial to inform&#xD;
      CALM adaptations for service members (SMs), Veterans, their beneficiaries, and civilians with&#xD;
      bMET. Upon completion of the Phase IIa trial, a 2-year multi-arm randomized Phase IIb Pilot&#xD;
      Trial will be conducted.&#xD;

    <description>Exit interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed verbatim via Dragon Software. A co- investigator and a second independent coder will separately review each transcript to identify common themes and develop a coding framework of free responses.

    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) is a 9-item self-report inventory measures depressive symptoms. Derived from the validated full Patient Health Questionnaire, the PHQ-9 asks participants to rate frequency of their depressive symptoms over the previous two weeks using a 4-point Likert scale, ranging from 0 (not at all) to 3 (nearly every day). Total scores (summing all items) range from 0-27. Guidelines for score interpretation suggest: 0-5 minimal depression, 5-9 mild depression, 10-14 moderate depression, 15-19 moderately severe depression, and &gt;20 severe depression.</description>

    <description>Death and Dying Distress Scale (DADDS). The DADDS is a validated measure of death anxiety in patients with advanced cancer. The 15-item scale includes items about distress related to the dying process, running out of time, and the impact of one's death on loved ones. The items are scored on a six-point Likert scale: 0 (not distressed) to 5 (extreme distress). Moderate death anxiety is defined by Death and Dying Distress Scale scores between 25 and 46, and severe death anxiety is defined as scores &gt;47.</description>

Item scores are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 80.</description>

The TAPS-2 is a brief assessment adapted from the Alcohol, Smoking, and Substance Involvement Screening Tool (ASSIST)-Lite104 including 3-4 yes/no questions for each class of substances assessing level of use, dependence, and concern from others. Cut-off for problematic substance use is 1+ and for substance use disorder is 2+.</description>
