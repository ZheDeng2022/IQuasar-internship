  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Supplements containing goldenseal, a perennial herb native to North America, have&#xD;
      consistently ranked among the top 20 highest selling natural products throughout the last&#xD;
      decade. Goldenseal products are marketed as licensed natural health products in Canada and as&#xD;
      dietary supplements in the United States. Natural products made from dried roots of the&#xD;
      goldenseal plant are purported to have therapeutic value and are used to self-treat a range&#xD;
      of medical complications, including the common cold, allergic rhinitis, and digestive&#xD;
      disorders, such as diarrhea and constipation. Based on a previous clinical study, goldenseal&#xD;
      have been shown to precipitate pharmacokinetic interactions with metformin in healthy&#xD;
      volunteers. This follow-up study aims to evaluate the goldenseal-metformin interaction in&#xD;
      type 2 diabetic patients. Results from this proposed clinical study will (1) characterize the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic interaction between the botanical dietary supplement goldenseal and&#xD;
      anti-diabetic drug metformin, (2) provide evidence-based recommendations to mitigate drug&#xD;
      interaction risks, and (3) contribute to the development of a comprehensive strategy for&#xD;
      effectively assessing other potential natural-product drug interactions.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patient groups, including those afflicted with cardiovascular disease, cancer, HIV/AIDS,&#xD;
      hepatitis C, and diabetes, often supplement their prescribed pharmacotherapeutic regimens&#xD;
      with herbal and other natural products, raising concern for adverse interactions. Unlike for&#xD;
      drug-drug interactions, rigorous, harmonized guidelines for assessing the risk of natural&#xD;
      product-drug interactions do not exist. The NCCIH-funded Center of Excellence for Natural&#xD;
      Product Drug Interaction (NaPDI) Research was established in September 2015. The mission of&#xD;
      the NaPDI Center is to provide leadership in the identification, evaluation, and&#xD;
      dissemination of potential clinically meaningful pharmacokinetic natural product-drug&#xD;
      interactions. Goldenseal is one of four high priority natural products selected by the NaPDI&#xD;
      Center for further evaluation for drug interaction potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent clinical study completed by researchers at the NaPDI center showed that a&#xD;
      well-characterized, adulterant- and contaminant-free goldenseal product administered to 16&#xD;
      healthy volunteers (3 g daily by mouth for 6 consecutive days) resulted in a significant&#xD;
      decrease (23%) in metformin systemic exposure [area under the plasma concentration-time curve&#xD;
      (AUC)] with no change in half-life or renal clearance. Based on these clinical observations,&#xD;
      along with complementary in vitro data, the current working hypothesis is that goldenseal&#xD;
      interacts with intestinal organic cation transporter 1 to alter metformin disposition. These&#xD;
      observations may have clinical implications for diabetic patients, as metformin is the&#xD;
      first-line treatment and most prescribed anti-diabetic medication for type 2 diabetes. The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to assess the potential for goldenseal to alter the&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics and clinical effects of standard metformin treatment in well-controlled&#xD;
      adult type 2 diabetic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transporter inhibition represents an understudied mechanism of natural product-drug&#xD;
      interactions. The proposed clinical study will be the first of its kind to evaluate whether&#xD;
      such pharmacokinetic interactions can potentially affect clinical outcomes. The knowledge&#xD;
      gained from these efforts will ultimately build upon a systematic framework for effectively&#xD;
      studying other transporter-mediated natural product-drug interactions.&#xD;

    <description>Twenty type 2 diabetic subjects (10 men, 10 women) will be administered a single dose of midazolam (0.5 mg) intravenously via a peripherally inserted catheter in conjunction with their daily oral administration of metformin.
