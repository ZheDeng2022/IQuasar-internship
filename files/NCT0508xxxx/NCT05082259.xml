  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-centre Phase I dose finding and proof-of-concept study of the combination of&#xD;
      ASTX660 together with Pembrolizumab with expansion cohorts testing preliminary efficacy in&#xD;
      immune-refractory cancers, triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), cervical cancer, and&#xD;
      glioblastoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In contrast to the existing studies combining first-generation cIAP1/2 selective Smac&#xD;
      mimetics with immune check point inhibitors, the ASTEROID Phase I clinical trial will be the&#xD;
      first trial utilising triple cIAP1/2 and XIAP blockade by ASTX660 as a strategy to maximise&#xD;
      immunogenic cell death and the generation of an efficient adaptive immune response. ASTX660&#xD;
      is not simply being used to repeat the data already being acquired with other first&#xD;
      generation Smac mimetics. In contrast, we will investigate more in depth the mechanisms by&#xD;
      which ASTX660 elicits its therapeutic effects both on tumour and on the host immune system.&#xD;
      This will be critical to determine the best strategy to pursue in future later stage tumour&#xD;
      specific trials of IAP antagonists in combination with immunotherapy, and to ensure&#xD;
      appropriate molecular stratification biomarkers for the greatest benefit to patients.&#xD;

    <description>Increasing doses of ASTX660 in combination with a fixed dose of pembrolizumab to establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of ASTX660 and Pembrolizumab when given in combination in patients with advanced solid tumours.&#xD;
escalating doses of ASTX660 will be investigated in combination with a fixed dose of Pembrolizumab (200mg). ASTX660 administration will follow a 7 day on / 14 day off pattern (ie dosing for 7 consecutive days leading up to administration of the immune check-point inhibitors). Therefore in Cycle 1, ASTX660 will be given alone from Day 1 to Day 7, followed by a 14 day break, then taken again in Cycle 2 . Each cycle will run for a period of 21 days, with ASTX660 taken always on Days 1 to 7 and Pembrolizumab given always on Day 8.&#xD;
Up to 4 dose levels of ASTX660 will be explored.</description>

The treatment schedule will be the same as that for Part A, i.e. each cycle will be 21 days-long. Pembrolizumab will always be administered on D8 of every cycle. ASTX660 will be taken daily on Days 1-7.&#xD;
Part B will be split into 3 cohorts; Cohort B1, Cohort B2 and Cohort B3.&#xD;
