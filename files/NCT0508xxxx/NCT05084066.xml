      This study aims to evaluate whether remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) daily for 28 days&#xD;
      reduces the symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery disease&#xD;
      (PAD). The study evaluates the effect of RIPC on patients' total walking distance (TWC),&#xD;
      initial claudication distance (ICD), and time to relief of claudication (TRC). In addition,&#xD;
      the trial investigates the effect of RIPC on different arterial functional characteristics&#xD;
      and low molecular weight metabolites in serum and affected skeletal muscle.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A research hypothesis is that repeated remote ischemic preconditioning (RIPC) daily for 28&#xD;
      days reduces the symptoms of intermittent claudication in patients with peripheral artery&#xD;
      disease (PAD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators plan to conduct a randomized controlled trial. Clinically stable patients&#xD;
      with PAD and intermittent claudication are randomly allocated to receive a repeated RIPC or&#xD;
      sham for 28 days. An automated device generates RIPC. One cycle of RIPC consists of 4 cycles&#xD;
      of 5-min upper limb ischemia followed by 5-min reperfusion (lasting a total of 35 minutes).&#xD;
      The participant places the device on his upper arm and presses the &quot;Start &quot;button, starting&#xD;
      the intervention. The intervention occurs at rest in the participant's home environment. The&#xD;
      first intervention takes place in the research center, where the research assistant teaches&#xD;
      the participant how to use the device. In the sham group, a RIPC imitation is performed. The&#xD;
      sham device has the same sound and light effects as the active device; the only difference is&#xD;
      that the pressure in the cuff does not increase, so ischemia does not occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization is performed using blocks. Each block has 2-4 subjects. Subjects are divided&#xD;
      according to smoking status (active smoker yes/no) and age (≥ 65 years or &lt; 65 years old).&#xD;
      Randomized letters (whether the subject will go into the experimental group or the sham&#xD;
      group) are placed in opaque envelopes, which are opened right before the first intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will visit the research center twice. During the first visit, they fill in the&#xD;
      VASCUQOL-6 questionnaire to evaluate their symptoms and health-related quality of life. In&#xD;
      addition, the investigators collect participants' blood and urine samples, measure their&#xD;
      arterial stiffness parameters and assess symptom-free and maximal walking distance on a&#xD;
      treadmill. The investigators will take a skeletal muscle biopsy from the first ten&#xD;
      participants in each group using a tiny percutaneous needle biopsy (TPNB) technique to&#xD;
      measure low molecular weight metabolites in affected skeletal muscle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These steps are repeated on the second visit (after 28 days of intervention). After data&#xD;
      collection is completed, a statistical analysis is performed to evaluate whether RIPC&#xD;
      improves participants' maximal walking distance, arterial stiffness, and metabolic&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

    <description>An automated device performs four 5-minute episodes of upper limb ischemia in which the cuff pressure in the experimental group remains at 200 mmHg for 5 minutes, causing and ensuring ischemia. Ischemic episodes alternate with 5-minute reperfusion. The intervention lasts a total of 35 minutes. The participant places the device on his upper arm and presses the &quot;Start&quot; button, starting the intervention. The intervention takes place at rest in the patient's home environment daily for 28 days. During the first visit to the research center, the research assistant teaches the participant how to use the device. The device measures the patient's blood pressure at the start of the intervention. If the patient's blood pressure is above 200 mmHg, the device will not perform the intervention.</description>
