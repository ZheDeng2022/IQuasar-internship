  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      iSpecimen aims to create a clinical partner network of hospitals, laboratories, academic&#xD;
      institutions, and other healthcare organizations (&quot;institutions&quot;) capable of providing&#xD;
      researchers and educators (&quot;researchers&quot;) with annotated biospecimens for use in biomarker&#xD;
      discovery and validation; diagnostic test and instrumentation development and validation;&#xD;
      therapeutics development; other medical research including the impact that various specimen&#xD;
      collection and handling methods and conditions have on research results; and in education&#xD;
      such as researcher or physician training (collectively &quot;research&quot;).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The level of involvement for each network institution will vary based on the type of specimen&#xD;
      to which they have access (e.g. biofluids, tissues and/or cells) and the category of&#xD;
      collection (remnant specimens that were originally collected for clinical testing and/or&#xD;
      specimens specifically collected for research) in accordance with the institution's elected&#xD;
      preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In most cases, potential participants will be identified and approached upon presenting for&#xD;
      clinical care or recruited specifically for the study using outreach programs. If additional&#xD;
      screening activities are required to determine eligibility criteria, the potential&#xD;
      participant may be presented with the opportunity to participate in these activities as part&#xD;
      of the study. These screening activities will be minimal risk in nature and are described&#xD;
      further below. Should potential participants meet screening criteria, they may then be asked&#xD;
      to provide biospecimens according to current research needs. Individual participants or&#xD;
      groups of participants may be sought according to specific clinical, lifestyle, and/or&#xD;
      demographic characteristics. The providers of these samples may be healthy participants or&#xD;
      participants with a medical condition of interest to the research community but regardless,&#xD;
      all specimens collected under this protocol (whether for screening purposes and for&#xD;
      distribution to researchers) will qualify as minimal risk activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biospecimens may be distributed to researchers at academic institutions, hospitals, clinical&#xD;
      and government laboratories, and corporations including diagnostic, medical device,&#xD;
      biopharmaceutical and biotechnology companies. The types of research studies and testing that&#xD;
      may be performed using the biospecimens will be varied, and it is not possible to provide a&#xD;
      description of all potential studies. Some researchers may perform genetic testing on the&#xD;
      specimens, some may use the specimens to develop cell lines, and some may cryopreserve the&#xD;
      specimens for many years, awaiting a research use. The specimens may also be used for&#xD;
      educational purposes, such as training lab techs on the proper testing of samples or&#xD;
      physicians on the proper reading of stained slides. The iSpecimen consent forms will indicate&#xD;
      a broad scope of possible research and educational uses and activities.&#xD;

        iSpecimen will specify the population for screening and biospecimen collection, based on&#xD;
        current research requests submitted to iSpecimen by researchers. All potential participants&#xD;
        whose diagnoses, demographic profile, and/or clinically indicated care are consistent with&#xD;
        the specified criteria for the collection will be considered eligible to participate.&#xD;
