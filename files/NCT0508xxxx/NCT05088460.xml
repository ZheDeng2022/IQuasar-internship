  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Two cohorts are being studied based on leptin levels. Cohort A is composed of patients with&#xD;
      baseline leptin &lt;8.0 ng/mL and Cohort B is composed of patients with baseline leptin 8.0 to&#xD;
      ≤20.0 ng/mL&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objectives will be evaluated for patients in Cohort A only:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of REGN4461 on fasting triglycerides (TG) in patients with&#xD;
           elevated baseline fasting TG&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of REGN4461 on hyperglycemia in patients with elevated baseline&#xD;
           Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary objectives of the study will be evaluated for Cohort B and for the&#xD;
      combined set of Cohorts A plus B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of REGN4461 on fasting TG levels in patients with&#xD;
           hypertriglyceridemia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of REGN4461 on glycemic control in patients with hyperglycemia&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following secondary objectives of the study will be evaluated for Cohorts A and B&#xD;
      separately, and for the combined set of Cohorts A plus B:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of REGN4461 on liver fat in patients with hepatic steatosis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the effect of REGN4461 on hunger&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate safety and tolerability of REGN4461&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the concentration profile of REGN4461 over time&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess immunogenicity to REGN4461&#xD;
