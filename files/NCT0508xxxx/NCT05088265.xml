  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is observational, designed to collect real world use and safety data for those&#xD;
      using the Bigfoot Unity Diabetes Management System for 6 months. Participants will be those&#xD;
      with a prescription to use the Bigfoot Unity System. Medical practices prescribing Bigfoot&#xD;
      Unity and Sponsor representatives will provide information about the study to current users&#xD;
      and individuals considering initiation of the Bigfoot Unity System. During the course of the&#xD;
      study, participants will be asked to use the Bigfoot Unity System in accordance with the&#xD;
      prescription provided by their healthcare professional (HCP).&#xD;

    <description>The Bigfoot Unity System is a wirelessly connected set of hardware and software that is intended for use by people with diabetes mellitus who use disposable insulin pens for self-injection of insulin. Bigfoot Unity consists of the Abbott FreeStyle Libre 2 Sensor, two durable insulin pen caps (one each for specific rapid-acting and long-acting insulin pens) and an iOS-specific mobile App.</description>
