  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to test the following hypotheses in a randomized controlled trial of&#xD;
      post-partum women with a history of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) that will be followed&#xD;
      up for up to 4 years:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Post-partum pregnancy is ideal for behavioural modification and adopting a healthy&#xD;
           lifestyle. Using the continous glucose monitoring (CGM) sensor and an exercise tracker&#xD;
           will promote self-motivation and awareness by positive reinforcement and behavioural&#xD;
           changes to improve diet, control body weight and increase physical activity in this&#xD;
           group of post-partum women who are at high risk for developing Type II Diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The use of the continous glycose monitoring (CGM) sensor and exercise tracker will&#xD;
           motivate women to modify their dietary food intake and physical activity over time,&#xD;
           reducing their cardiovascular risk factors for developing metabolic syndrome by lowering&#xD;
           their baseline blood pressure, BMI, reducing their waist circumference and body fat&#xD;
           mass, glycaemic levels and fasting lipids within the targeted healthy range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. There will be an increase in the quality adjusted life years (QALYs) gained based on&#xD;
           improvements in HbA1C and other proximal outcomes at the end of the trial.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The increased incidence of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) resulting from increased&#xD;
      insulin resistance has become a major health concern. GDM affects 5-10% of pregnant women in&#xD;
      Europe, while the prevalence in Asian populations is significantly higher at approximately&#xD;
      15-20%. There is a need for early postpartum intervention strategies beginning soon after&#xD;
      birth, but yet there are limited of such intervention studies conducted in Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial and hospital-based study. A total of 300 post-partum&#xD;
      women who attended KK Women's and Children's Hospital (KKH) for antenatal consultation and&#xD;
      were diagnosed with GDM using International association of diabetes and pregnancy study&#xD;
      groups (IADPSG) guidelines at KKH, with a BMI range from 20-40, and physically fit to&#xD;
      participate in moderate intensity walking will be approached for prospective recruitment.&#xD;
      These subjects will be followed-up to determine if they will have normal oral glucose&#xD;
      tolerance test (OGTT) results at 6 weeks postpartum. If all the inclusion criteria is met,&#xD;
      these women will be recruited into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruited women will be randomly allocated to the intervention or control group. Those&#xD;
      placed in the intervention group, which will also be known as the Wearable Care Group, will&#xD;
      receive both a continous glucose monitoring (CGM) and an exercise tracker which will be a&#xD;
      FitBit watch. Those placed in the control group, which will also be known as the Scheduled&#xD;
      Care Group will receive standard medical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to both the control (Scheduled Care Group) and the intervention group&#xD;
      (Wearable Care Group) will be followed up in the specialist outpatient clinics with a total&#xD;
      of 7 visits for up to 4 years. Various testing will be carried out at relevant time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected through questionnaires and clinical measurements. The questionnaires&#xD;
      include socio-economic factors, a quality of life questionnaire, maternal diet, medical&#xD;
      histories, lifestyle factors, health status, and home environment. Bio-physical measurements&#xD;
      will be obtained from anthropometric measurements of participants, human biological materials&#xD;
      such as blood, are collected from the participants at their follow-up time points with the&#xD;
      I-HIPS study upon their consent.&#xD;
