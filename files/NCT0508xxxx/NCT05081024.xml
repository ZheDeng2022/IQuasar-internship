  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study measures the levels of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in patients with stage II-III&#xD;
      rectal cancer before, during, and after treatment to find out if the presence or absence of&#xD;
      ctDNA in patient's blood using the Signatera test can be used to gauge how different&#xD;
      treatments may affect rectal cancer. ctDNA is DNA from the rectal cancer that is circulating&#xD;
      in the blood. The purpose of this study is to understand if the way rectal tumors respond to&#xD;
      standard treatment can be associated with varying levels of ctDNA.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the percentage of participants that achieve complete clinical response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess circulating tumor deoxyribonucleic acid (ctDNA) status among participants&#xD;
      receiving total neoadjuvant therapy (TNT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess molecular residual disease (MRD i.e., ctDNA status). III. To assess the rate of&#xD;
      transabdominal surgery. IV. To assess the rate pathological complete response after surgery.&#xD;
      V. To assess the rate of watch and -wait (W&amp;W) after TNT. VI. To assess disease-free survival&#xD;
      (DFS). VII. To assess overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To characterize ctDNA clearance or non-clearance patterns during TNT. II. To correlate&#xD;
      ctDNA levels with a participant's pathological features. III. To preliminary assess the&#xD;
      prognostic performance of ctDNA levels in relation to participant's clinical outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo collection of blood samples at baseline (before any neoadjuvant therapy),&#xD;
      every 2 months while undergoing TNT, and then every 3 months for up to 3 years after&#xD;
      completion of TNT. Patients' medical records are also reviewed. Patients may undergo&#xD;
      collection of tissue sample if an archival tissue sample is not available.&#xD;
