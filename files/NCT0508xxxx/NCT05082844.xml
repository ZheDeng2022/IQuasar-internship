    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to document the clinical-radiological results from the case series of&#xD;
      patients surgically treated for rotator cuff lesions from 2009 to 2020 at the Rizzoli&#xD;
      Orthopaedic Institute Shoulder-Elbow Department.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      110 patients surgically treated for rotator cuff lesions from 2009 to 2020 will be included&#xD;
      in a retrospective-prospective and interventional study with clinical and radiological&#xD;
      evaluation at follow-up of at least 12 months.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Constant score</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 12 months after cuff rotator lesion surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The constant score is the most commonly used questionnaire for evaluating treatment outcomes of shoulder disorders. It's the scoring system recommended by the European Society of Shoulder and Elbow Surgery (SECEC / ESSE). It has the advantages of including pain score, functional assessment, range of motion, and strength measures. A high score corresponds to a great quality of function</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Visual Analog Scale (VAS):</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 12 months after cuff rotator lesion surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Analogue scale represented by a line of 10 cm length, ranging from &quot;absence of pain&quot; to &quot;the worst imaginable pain &quot;</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Simple Shoulder Test (SST)</measure>
    <time_frame>At least at leat 12 months after cuff rotator lesion surgery</time_frame>
    <description>SST test consists of 12 questions about physical functioning with dichotomous response options (yes or no). Scores range from 0 (worst) to 100 (best) and are reported as the percentage of items answered in the affirmative by the patient</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Short Form-12 (SF-12):</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 12 months after cuff rotator lesion surgery</time_frame>
    <description>SF-12 serves as a generic indicator of quality of life and assesses the individual's subjective perception of health, understood as biopsychosocial well-being. Through 12 of the 36 questions of the original questionnaire, the SF-12 investigates 8 different aspects related to health status: physical activity, role limitations due to physical health, emotional state, physical pain, perception of general health status, vitality, social activities and mental health; the synthesis of the total scores allows to build two synthetic indices, a physical health index (PCS-12) and a mental health index (MCS-12). The lower the score of the two indices, indicatively below 20 points, the greater the level of disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Treatment opinion post- surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 12 months after cuff rotator lesion surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Patient satisfaction with their post-surgery recovery status will be assessed.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Magnetic Resonance Imaging</measure>
    <time_frame>At least 12 months after cuff rotator lesion surgery</time_frame>
    <description>Magnetic Resonace Imaging will be carried for evaluating a possible plica retraction.</description>
