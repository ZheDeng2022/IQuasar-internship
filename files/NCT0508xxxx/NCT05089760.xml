  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neonatal sepsis remains one of the most important cause of mortality and morbidities in&#xD;
      China. This study will establish a prospective registral cohort of all infants with&#xD;
      culture-proven neonatal sepsis in Chinese NICUs participating in the Chinese Neonatal Network&#xD;
      (CHNN). The microbiology, antimicrobial resistance patterns and neonatal outcomes will be&#xD;
      described in detail for this cohort.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All infants with culture-proven sepsis in NICUs of CHNN will be enrolled in the study.&#xD;
      Detailed data on microbiology, resistance pattern, neonatal mortality and morbidities will be&#xD;
      collected and described. Risk factors for multi-resistant bacteria infections and for&#xD;
      sepsis-related mortality will be identified.&#xD;

    <description>This is a prospective observational cohort study. The purpose of the study was to compare the incidence of mortality, complications, and other outcomes between infants with multi-resistant bacteria sepsis and infants with sepsis caused by non-multi-resistant bacteria, and compare the incidence of complications and other outcomes between infants with sepsis-related death and infants who survive.</description>
