    <textblock>
      Immune nephritis is a chronic glomerular disease originating in the kidney caused by various&#xD;
      etiologies.Clinically, secondary chronic kidney damage caused by systemic diseases such as&#xD;
      diabetes, systemic lupus erythematosus and gout is named after its primary disease, such as&#xD;
      diabetic nephropathy and lupus nephritis. Autoimmune diseases only show local pathological&#xD;
      damage, but more often systemic lesions. If not diagnosed and treated in time or poorly&#xD;
      controlled, a risk of disability or even death as the course of the disease progresses.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that B cells can present their own antigens to autoimmune T cells to&#xD;
      promote the release of inflammatory factors, or they can differentiate into plasma cells to&#xD;
      release autoantibodies, and play an important role in the occurrence and progression of&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases. In recent years, it has become a major research focus to deplete B cells&#xD;
      in patients or inhibit B cell function. This research focuses on CAR-T cells killing B cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current research progress, our center intends to conduct research on the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of CD19/BCMA CAR-T cells in the treatment of refractory systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus.&#xD;
