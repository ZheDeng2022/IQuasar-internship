  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, reactogenicity and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      candidate CMV recombinant protein subunit (CMVsu) vaccine consisting of a combination of&#xD;
      glycoproteins B (gB) and pentamer antigens adjuvanted, regardless of baseline CMV&#xD;
      sero-status. This FTiH study will be conducted in healthy adults 18 to 50 years of age, in&#xD;
      which the 4 dose levels of the vaccine will be administered in a step-wise dose escalation&#xD;
      manner, based upon safety adjudication.&#xD;
