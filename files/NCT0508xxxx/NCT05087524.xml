    <textblock>
      This is a study of the BinaxNOW Covid-19 Ag Card as a method to rapidly identify SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      infection in asymptomatic children, teachers, and other school staff for exclusion. 240&#xD;
      students and 80 teachers in the Madison Metropolitan School District (MMSD) will be enrolled&#xD;
      and can expect to be on study for up to 8 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose and research goal of this project is to understand how the virus&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 is spread in the K-8 setting, decrease secondary cases of COVID-19, improve&#xD;
      attendance and educational opportunities for children, teachers and other school staff, and&#xD;
      decrease time away from work for parents (with threat of loss of employment and other&#xD;
      benefits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that prompt diagnostic testing for SARS-CoV-2 in symptomatic&#xD;
      children and twice weekly surveillance of asymptomatic children (with appropriate exclusion&#xD;
      of children with positive tests) will be effective as a strategy to achieve maximum&#xD;
      attendance in school and minimal disruption of the associated workforce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 1: Determine feasibility of using BinaxNOW COVID-19 cards for surveillance of infection&#xD;
      with SARS-CoV-2 in teachers, other school staff, and school children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims are to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if it is feasible to obtain nasal samples to be used with the BinaxNOW COVID-19 for&#xD;
           diagnosis of COVID-19 in children or teachers/other school staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  if it is feasible to obtain nasal samples twice weekly to be used with BinaxNOW COVID-19&#xD;
           for surveillance of infection with SARS-CoV-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The specificity of positive tests for SARS-CoV-2 obtained for diagnosis or surveillance&#xD;
           compared to traditional PCR diagnostic testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STEP 2: Determine effectiveness of prompt diagnostic testing and twice weekly surveillance&#xD;
      for SARS-CoV-2 among children and school faculty/staff to reduce the rate of positive cases&#xD;
      (symptomatic) of COVID-19 in an elementary school setting resulting in an ultimate decrease&#xD;
      in absenteeism for students and an increase in attendance for their parents at the workplace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a record of the pilot study (STEP 1).&#xD;

    <description>Participants will agree to the performance of nasal swabs samples to be used for diagnosis or screening. Samples will be obtained by research staff in the school setting. MMSD has obtained a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) waiver for collection of samples. When there is a positive test, a saliva sample will be collected for testing with a standard polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method. The standard PCR samples will be processed at UW Clinical Laboratory.</description>

    <intervention_name>BinaxNOW Ag Card</intervention_name>
    <description>A nasal swab specimen is collected from the participant, 6 drops of extraction reagent from a dropper bottle are added to the top hole of the swab well. The participant sample is inserted into the test card through the bottom hole of the swab well, and firmly pushed upwards until the swab tip is visible through the top hole. The swab is rotated 3 times clockwise and the card is closed, bringing the extracted sample into contact with the test strip. Test results are interpreted visually at 15 minutes based on the presence or absence of visually detectable pink/purple colored lines.</description>
