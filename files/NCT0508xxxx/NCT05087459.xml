  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is one of the most common malignant tumors in the world,&#xD;
      accounting for the second leading cause of cancer death in China.Surgical treatment of&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma is the most important means for long-term survival of patients with&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma, including hepatectomy and liver transplantation.Chronic liver&#xD;
      disease caused by hepatitis B infection is the main pathogenic factor of liver cancer in&#xD;
      China. Meanwhile, nearly 80% of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma are complicated with&#xD;
      cirrhosis, and the incidence of thrombocytopenia in patients with cirrhosis is reported to be&#xD;
      as high as 78%.Many previous studies have found that thrombocytopenia is closely related to&#xD;
      perioperative outcome of hepatocellular carcinoma.The purpose of this study was to evaluate&#xD;
      the efficacy and safety of avatripopa in the treatment of thrombocytopenia in patients with&#xD;
      primary hepatocellular carcinoma undergoing elective hepatectomy and its effect on&#xD;
      perioperative outcome.&#xD;

      The indicators included changes in platelet count before and after drug treatment and&#xD;
      operation, the nature and amount of postoperative drainage (ascites), duration of indwelling&#xD;
      drainage tube, intraoperative blood loss, perioperative complications, length of hospital&#xD;
      stay, etc.After comprehensive consideration of all perioperative indicators, we selected the&#xD;
      total amount of drainage (ascites) multiple days after surgery as the primary outcome.&#xD;
