  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the past century, there have been major advances in unilateral cleft-lip repair&#xD;
      techniques toward the method's modern form. The first documented cleft-lip repair involved&#xD;
      simple freshening and approximation of the cut cleft edges, followed by the use of curved&#xD;
      incisions to allow lengthening of the lip. Straight-line closure repairs were used in the&#xD;
      early 1900; however, straight-line closures had the disadvantage of creating a vertical scar&#xD;
      contracture, leading to notching of the lip. This led to the development of several methods&#xD;
      in the mid-twentieth century that are grouped as quadrangular flaps, triangular flaps, and&#xD;
      rotation-advancement techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The two basic techniques that are most commonly used for unilateral cleft lip (UCL) closure&#xD;
      are the Tennison-Randall and the Millard rotation_advancement techniques. both techniques&#xD;
      address the importance of repositioning the lip muscle (orbicularis oris) in the correct&#xD;
      anatomic orientation for optimal aesthetic and functional outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ultimate goal of cleft lip surgery is to achieve a perfectly symmetrical lip and nose. It&#xD;
      has been shown that for the general population, the more symmetrical the face, the more&#xD;
      attractive the face is. The appearance and symmetry of the nasolabial region is also seen as&#xD;
      one of the most important characteristics when evaluating the results of any facial surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of treatment outcome is vital to evaluate the success of cleft management and the&#xD;
      degree of improvement, especially in the present age of evidence-based medicine where&#xD;
      treatment guidelines for best practice are becoming an integral part of contemporary clinical&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The good goal of cleft lip repair is a symmetrical and balanced lip with minimal scar&#xD;
      restoring the natural contours of the face, as well as correcting functional anatomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives To evaluate the quantitative (anthropometric) assessment of modified Millard&#xD;
      technique in comparison to Tennison_ Randall technique in unilateral cleft lip (ucl) repair.&#xD;

    <description>In the modified Millard technique, points (nasal and Vermilion border points) and lines (rotational and advancement flap lines and mucosal lines) were drawn. Then, we cut the submucosal layer and created three flaps: advancement flap, rotational flap, and c flap. The orbicular muscle was dissected and freed from the columellar base on the non-cleft side and from the alar base on the cleft side. Using a vicryl 5-0, we sutured the anterior nasal floor; then, using vicryl 4-0, we sutured the alar base and muscle. Using vicryl 6-0, we sutured top of philtral column with point a, the peak of Cupid's bow, and tip of c flap with alar base. The suturing of mucosal lip was carried out using a vicryl 5-0.</description>

    <description>In the Tennison-Randall technique, points (nasal and Vermilion border points) and lines (Skin triangle flap lines and mucosal lines) were drawn. Then, we cut the submucosal layer and created equilateral triangle flap and releasing incision. The orbicular muscle was dissected and freed from the columellar base on the non-cleft side and from the alar base on the cleft side. The suturing of the anterior nasal floor, alar base, and muscle followed the same principles of the modified Millard technique. The cutaneous repair was done by suturing the top of philtral column, the peak of Cupid's bow, point a, the line between the top of philtral column and the peak of Cupid's bow with b-8 and 3-a with b-a.</description>
