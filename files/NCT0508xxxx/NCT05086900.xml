    <textblock>
      This study aims to develop and validate the first set of patient-reported outcome measures&#xD;
      for recurrent urinary tract infection (UTI): the Recurrent UTI Symptom Scale and the&#xD;
      Recurrent UTI Impact Questionnaire. These tools could be used in clinical practice, clinical&#xD;
      trials and research to gather an insight into a patient's perspective of their recurrent UTI&#xD;
      symptom severity and its impact on their life, as well as determining any possible&#xD;
      improvement or other change in their condition due to interventions (e.g. antibiotic&#xD;
      treatment).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infection (UTI) is a highly prevalent infection, most frequently affecting&#xD;
      females. Recurrent UTI, a chronic condition defined as experiencing two or more UTIs in six&#xD;
      months or three or more in twelve months, is associated with significant symptom burden and&#xD;
      lowered quality of life. In addition to this personal impact, the effects span more widely to&#xD;
      issues such as increased healthcare costs, work absenteeism, and antimicrobial resistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are currently no validated patient-reported outcome measures to assess recurrent UTI&#xD;
      symptoms and impact. These measures are much needed to encourage a more patient-centred&#xD;
      approach to recurrent UTI treatment and care, which could be especially important given&#xD;
      evidence that current routine testing approaches, and thus treatment approaches, are not&#xD;
      sufficient alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This mixed-methods study aims to consult both clinicians and patients in order to develop and&#xD;
      validate the first set of patient-reported outcome measures for recurrent UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Concept elicitation Conduct a literature review and examine the findings of an&#xD;
      international qualitative study exploring the experience of over 2,000 people living with&#xD;
      recurrent UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Initial development and item generation Develop draft questionnaire items,&#xD;
      instructions, and scale response options in line with current healthcare guidance and&#xD;
      conclusions from Phase I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Modified Delphi method with 10-20 expert clinicians Screen the draft&#xD;
      questionnaires by two rounds of a modified Delphi method, assessing item and instruction&#xD;
      clarity and relevance for recurrent UTI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Use qualitative comments, content validity indices, and consensus scores to refine existing&#xD;
      items, and remove or add new ones where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV: Cognitive interviews with 25-30 patients Conduct one-to-one cognitive interviews&#xD;
      using a think aloud and verbal probing procedure to verify the content validity and clarity&#xD;
      of the new measures from the patient's perspective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Summarise and analyse the interview transcripts using the Questionnaire Appraisal System and&#xD;
      content analysis, used to refine the measures before Phase V.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase V: Two-part online pilot with 100+ patients Conduct a cross-sectional survey in which&#xD;
      participants complete the new recurrent UTI measures and comparable existing standardised&#xD;
      measures for each subscale (e.g. UTI Symptom Assessment). Participants will complete this&#xD;
      twice, 24 hours apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Verify the psychometric properties of the new measures, including exploratory factor&#xD;
      analysis, internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and criterion validity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optimise the measures for clinical and research purposes based on these analyses.&#xD;
