  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to examine the clinical effects of lozenges containing three&#xD;
      extracellular matrix-degrading enzymes on dental plaque accumulation and removal, prevention&#xD;
      of gingivitis, and oral microbiome composition after professional tooth cleaning, as compared&#xD;
      to a placebo lozenge without enzymes. Two different concentrations of the enzymes will be&#xD;
      tested, to investigate a potential dose-dependent effect of the enzymes. Furthermore, safety&#xD;
      of the enzyme lozenge will be assessed by clinical evaluation of the oral mucosa. The null&#xD;
      hypothesis is that treatment with enzyme-containing lozenges does not affect plaque&#xD;
      accumulation as compared to a placebo control.&#xD;
