      The purpose of this research is to determine the effectiveness of using human Umbilical Cord&#xD;
      (UC) allograft to help improve return to erectile function and bladder control in patients&#xD;
      following robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP).&#xD;

      Participation in this study will involve MLG (Multi-Layered Perinatal Tissue Allograft)&#xD;
      allografdt, which is implanted during the surgery. This allograft is currently FDA approved&#xD;
      and used for several type of surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MLG is processed from tissue according to the American Association of Tissue Banks (AATB)&#xD;
      standards, and is regulated as a cell, tissue, or cellular or tissue-based product (HCT/P)&#xD;
      under Section 361 of the Public Health Service Act. The grafts are distributed by Samaritan&#xD;
      Biologics, LLC; an FDA-registered tissue bank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MLG allograft will be placed on each neurovascular bundle (NVB) bilaterally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MLG is supplied as sterile sheets having dimensions of 2cm x 2cm and a thickness of&#xD;
      approximately 0.8-1.0mm thick.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants receiving MLG will have it placed around the neurovascular bundle. Placement of&#xD;
      the graft should not take over 5 minutes of time to impact overall surgical time length&#xD;
      significantly.&#xD;
