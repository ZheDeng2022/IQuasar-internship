    <description>Phase Ib (Explored the appropriate dose of Parsaclisib in combination with chidamide)&#xD;
Parsaclisib is taken orally every day continuously, at approximately the same time every day, without food restriction, once a day.&#xD;
Chidamide is taken fixed 20mg twice a week with an interval of no less than 3 days, and taken 30 minutes after breakfast.&#xD;
Phase II:&#xD;
Induced treatment: Received the initial dose of Parsaclisib determined in Phase Ib within the first 8 weeks.&#xD;
Maintain treatment: 2.5mg orally every day continuously, at approximately the same time every day, without food restriction, once a day.&#xD;
Chidamide is taken fixed 20mg twice a week with an interval of no less than 3 days, and taken 30 minutes after breakfast.</description>

    <description>Phase Ib: Parsaclisib is taken orally every day continuously, at approximately the same time every day, without food restriction, once a day. This stage follows the traditional &quot;3+3&quot; model. Parsaclisib is set at 10 mg/day, 15 mg/day, 20 mg/day 3 dose groups, starting from 10 mg/day, each group included 3 subjects. The final dose determined at this stage will be used in the Phase II study.&#xD;
Phase II: Induced treatment: Received the initial dose of Parsaclisib determined in Phase Ib within the first 8 weeks (including the treatment received in Phase Ib).&#xD;
Maintain treatment: 2.5mg orally every day continuously, at approximately the same time every day, without food restriction, once a day until disease progression, death or unacceptable toxicity developments. The maximum treatment time of Parsaclisib is no more than 2 years.</description>
