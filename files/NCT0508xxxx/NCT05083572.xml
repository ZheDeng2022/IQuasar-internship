  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Dysbiosis of the gut microbiome has been recognized to underlie the pathogenesis of various&#xD;
      gastrointestinal conditions. Probiotics are known to exert beneficial effects on gut health&#xD;
      and have great potential for use as microbiome interventions for gastrointestinal and&#xD;
      metabolic diseases. While it is widely known that probiotic bacteria favourably alter the&#xD;
      intestinal microflora balance, their other mechanisms of action have not been systematically&#xD;
      characterized. The ability of probiotics to modulate dysbiosis may lead to reduced levels of&#xD;
      endotoxaemia and oxidative stress. In this study, the investigators propose to examine the&#xD;
      effects of 4-week VSL#3 treatment on the gut microbiome and bacterial translocation in&#xD;
      healthy Asian volunteers with and without colonic lavage or antibiotic treatment. The study&#xD;
      will also examine the same outcome parameters 4 weeks upon cessation of the product. The&#xD;
      findings derived from the study will provide valuable insights into the microbiota changes&#xD;
      associated with colonic lavage or antibiotic treatment, and the use of probiotic (VSL#3).&#xD;
      This has important clinical implications in designing treatment strategies in clinical&#xD;
      practice such as the use of VSL#3 as microbiome interventions with antibiotics which are&#xD;
      known to induce Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea, as well as in the therapeutic&#xD;
      management of various diseases associated with dysbiosis.&#xD;

      This will be a randomized controlled, partially-blinded study with four study arms to (i)&#xD;
      examine the effect of VSL#3 on the gut microbiome with and without colonic lavage, (ii) with&#xD;
      and without antibiotic treatment, (iii) compare the gut microbiome after natural recovery and&#xD;
      with VSL#3 treatment following colonic lavage, and (iv) evaluate the efficacy of VSL#3 in&#xD;
      reducing bacterial translocation and oxidative stress.&#xD;
