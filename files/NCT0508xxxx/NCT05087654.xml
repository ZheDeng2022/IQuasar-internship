      Aging societies are of public health concern worldwide. It is critical to develop strategies&#xD;
      that harness technology to enhance older adults' mental health. This study aimed to explore&#xD;
      the effects of a combination of three-dimensional virtual reality (3D VR) and hands-on&#xD;
      horticultural activities on the mental health of community-dwelling older adults. Used a&#xD;
      quasi-experimental design. A total of 62 community-dwelling older adults were recruited. The&#xD;
      members of the experimental group participated in an 8-week intervention program.&#xD;
      Participants of both groups completed before-and-after intervention measurements for outcome&#xD;
      variables that included perceived self-esteem, depression, isolation, mastery and achievement&#xD;
      motives, which were analyzed using the generalized estimating equation (GEE). This study&#xD;
      found beneficial effects of a combination of 3D VR and hands-on horticultural activities on&#xD;
      community-dwelling older adults' mental health.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-esteem</measure>
    <time_frame>about three months</time_frame>
    <description>Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale consists of 14 items and each item is scored on a Likert-type scale that ranges from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree), with higher scores indicating a higher level of self-esteem.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>about three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of the Geriatric Depression Scale was used, which has a total of 15 items. All items were answered as either yes (1) or no (0). The total raw scores ranged from 0 to 15, with a higher score indicating a higher level of depression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived isolation</measure>
    <time_frame>about three months</time_frame>
    <description>A short-form scale of perceived isolation was used to measure isolation. Each item was scored on a Likert-type scale from 1 (never) to 4 (often), with higher scores indicating a higher level of perceived isolation.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Perceived mastery</measure>
    <time_frame>about three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Chinese version of the Perceived Mastery Scale with a total of 7 items was used. Each item was scored on a Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree). The total raw score ranged from 7 to 28, with a higher score indicating a higher level of perceived mastery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Achievement motives</measure>
    <time_frame>about three months</time_frame>
    <description>The Achievement Motives Scale (AMS) consists of two kinds of motives, referred to as Motive to Achieve Success, (MAS) and Motive to Avoid Failure (MAF). A short-form scale with 10 items was used to measure achievement motives, with 5 items each for MAS and MAF. Each item was scored on a Likert-type scale from 1 (strongly agree) to 4 (strongly disagree).</description>
