  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial studies how well EMBr Wave technology works in reducing hot flashes in women with&#xD;
      a history of breast cancer. Hot flashes are a common symptom experienced by menopausal women.&#xD;
      The standard treatment for hot flashes is hormone replacement therapy, however hormone&#xD;
      replacement therapy cannot be used in women with a history of, or active, breast cancer. EMBr&#xD;
      Wave is a personal heating and cooling device worn on the wrist. EMBr Wave may help reduce&#xD;
      hot flash severity in women with a history of breast cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the feasibility of using EMBr Wave technology in women with a history of&#xD;
      breast cancer who are experiencing bothersome hot flashes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the preliminary efficacy of EMBr Wave in reducing hot flash severity and&#xD;
      frequency in women with a history of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To identify in what ways EMBr Wave has the greatest potential efficacy, such as reduction&#xD;
      in vasomotor symptoms (VMS) severity, frequency, duration, sense of control, or self-esteem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To estimate effect sizes to inform power calculations for a future phase III trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients utilize the EMBr Wave device for 4 weeks, then crossover to arm B for 4&#xD;
      weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive no treatment for 4 weeks, then crossover to arm A for 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Feasibility will be evaluated primarily with respect to device usage. The proportion of patients who wear the device for at least 8 hours between 8:00 am and 8:00 pm for at least 22 days will be estimated using the entire sample and a 95% Jeffreys interval for binomial proportions will be computed.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Feasibility will be evaluated secondarily with respect to patient satisfaction. The mean patient satisfaction scores for each Likert-type question and proportion of patients reporting satisfaction scores at or above 7 will be estimated in the entire sample and compared between sequence groups at the 5% significance level (two-sided).Rated on a 10-point Likert scale with 10 being most satisfied or most effective.</description>
