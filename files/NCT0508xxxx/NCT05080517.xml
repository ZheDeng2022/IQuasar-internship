  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In 2017, cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) were the leading cause of death worldwide. Most&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases can be prevented by changing risk behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CVDs are distributed within a population along a socio-economic gradient. This is true within&#xD;
      a country, but also between countries with different income levels. People living in a&#xD;
      high-income country have better CVD health status than those living in a low-income country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have shown that community-based primary prevention of cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      can be effective. Other studies have shown that champions positively influence the&#xD;
      implementation of health promotion strategies at the community level. These champions are&#xD;
      people in the community who contribute to the implementation of new health programs by&#xD;
      involving their local networks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPICES project (Scaling-up Packages of Intervention for Cardiovascular disease prevention&#xD;
      in selected sites in Europe and Sub-Saharan Africa) is an international study that aims to&#xD;
      implement and evaluate a community-based cardiovascular disease prevention and control&#xD;
      program. It involves 5 low, middle and high income countries, including populations in urban,&#xD;
      semi-rural and rural areas. The study focused on four sets of interventions: health&#xD;
      promotion, cardiovascular risk profiling, management and self-management and follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In France, the territory of Central West Brittany (CWB) was chosen to participate in the&#xD;
      SPICES project because of the vulnerability of its population to cardiovascular disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is in this context that a type 1 hybrid study is being set up in the CWB territory as part&#xD;
      of the SPICES project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the quantitative part of the protocol (NCT03886064), a randomized controlled trial took&#xD;
      place simultaneously to evaluate the effectiveness of a behavior change program led by&#xD;
      community champions. Resident volunteers were selected based on their non-laboratory&#xD;
      Interheart score. Those with a moderate risk were included in the trial. They were then&#xD;
      distributed at random to an intervention group and a control group. The control group&#xD;
      received minimal counseling. Those in the intervention group were brought together in support&#xD;
      groups, with follow-up by champions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a type 1 hybrid trial, qualitative data on implementation are gathered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This qualitative study will seek understand why participants in the SPICES project staying&#xD;
      and/or stopping, from the point of view of champions A qualitative approach using&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews and focus groups was used. The objective is to explore maintaining&#xD;
      and/or stopping participants in the SPICES project, from the point of view of champions&#xD;

    <description>Explore the correlations between the identified factors and the personality traits of the champions. The major personality traits of the accompanying citizens will be evaluated according to the Big Five Inventory 10 questionnaire (BFI-10). The BFI-10 is a 10-item scale measuring the Big Five personality traits Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Openness. The scale was developed based on the 44-item Big Five Inventory (BFI-44; John, Donahue, &amp; Kentle, 1991; Rammstedt, 1997) and designed for contexts in which respondents' time is severely limited.</description>
