  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the clinical characteristics and management purseued for atrial fibrillation in a&#xD;
      tertiary care center of Pakistan. We aimed at looking baseline characteristics and associated&#xD;
      co-morbid conditions and primary diagnosis associated with atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      It is a retrospective observational study done at Aga Khan University Hospital, Karachi,&#xD;
      Pakistan, which is a tertiary care teaching hospital with a cardiology and cardiac surgery&#xD;
      center. Aga Khan Hospital is one of the main referral health centers in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by Aga Khan University ethical review committee (ERC No. #&#xD;
      2019-1008-2905).We reviewed hospital record files of 651 patients including both males and&#xD;
      females, admitted in Aga Khan University Hospital from 1st July 2018 to 31st December 2018,&#xD;
      who were found to have atrial fibrillation as a primary or associated diagnosis. Diagnosis of&#xD;
      atrial fibrillation was confirmed on a 12 lead ECG. Fifteen patients were excluded who did&#xD;
      not have electrocardiographic evidence of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For all patient, demographic information including age and gender, reason of admission and&#xD;
      duration of arrhythmia were noted from the written medical records. Comorbidities were&#xD;
      tabulated including: diabetes mellitus, hypertension, coronary artery disease, heart failure,&#xD;
      cardiomyopathy, valvular heart disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and&#xD;
      hyperthyroidism. Echocardiographic data were reviewed for left atrial (LA) dimension, LA&#xD;
      volume index and left ventricular (LV) systolic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were labeled as Diabetic if they had HbA1c of &gt;6.5gm/dl or they were already on&#xD;
      treatment for diabetes mellitus. Hypertension was defined as average of two readings of&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure of ≥140mmHg or diastolic blood pressure of ≥90mmHg or patients&#xD;
      already taking antihypertensive medications. Coronary artery disease was defined as ≥50%&#xD;
      stenosis in at least one of the epicardial coronary arteries. Cardiomyopathy was defined as&#xD;
      left ventricular ejection fraction of ≤50% Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was defined&#xD;
      as forced expiratory volume in 1st second to forced vital capacity ratio of &lt;70% of the&#xD;
      predicted value. Patients were labeled hyperthyroid if they have low serum TSH and high serum&#xD;
      concentration of free T4 or T3 as per laboratory reference range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients were followed from the time of inclusion to the time of discharge or till&#xD;
      inpatient death. Hemodynamic parameters including heart rate and blood pressure were recorded&#xD;
      at the time of inclusion for patients with known atrial fibrillation and at the time of onset&#xD;
      of arrhythmia for those with new onset atrial fibrillation. Patients' treatment record were&#xD;
      reviewed for medications. Complications related to atrial fibrillation or its treatment were&#xD;
      recorded.&#xD;
