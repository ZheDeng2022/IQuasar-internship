  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to compare the effectiveness of Cervical Stabilization and&#xD;
      Oculomotor Exercises in addition to the classical physiotherapy on pain severity, cervical&#xD;
      joint position sense, posture, cervical joint range of motion, strength and endurance of deep&#xD;
      cervical flexor muscles, static and dynamic balance, neck awareness, functional disability&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction in individuals with chronic neck pain. When the literature is&#xD;
      examined, there is no study comparing the effectiveness of cervical stabilization and&#xD;
      oculomotor exercises in individuals with chronic neck pain. However, it has also attracted&#xD;
      our attention that a progressive and dynamic program was not followed in studies stating the&#xD;
      oculomotor exercise program. In this sense, The study is important in terms of both comparing&#xD;
      the effects of these 3 treatments and presenting a progressive and dynamic exercise protocol&#xD;
      to the literature.&#xD;

      The Participants included in the study will be divided into 3 groups. Participants in Group 1&#xD;
      will receive cervical stabilization exercises in addition to the classical physiotherapy&#xD;
      program, individuals in Group 2 will receive oculomotor exercises in addition to the&#xD;
      classical physiotherapy program, and only the classical physiotherapy program will be applied&#xD;
      to group 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation, hotpack, classical massage and&#xD;
      stretching/posture exercises will be given to participants within the scope of the Classical&#xD;
      Physiotherapy program. In addition to the classical physiotherapy program, the participants&#xD;
      in the 1st and 2nd groups will be given exercises that gradually increase in difficulty&#xD;
      level, 3 days a week, for a total of 8 weeks, under the control of a physiotherapist.&#xD;
      Participants in the 3rd group will be given only classical physiotherapy. At the same time,&#xD;
      stretching and posture exercises will be performed under the control of a physiotherapist.&#xD;

    <measure>Cervical Joint Position Sense</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Cervical Joint Position Sense at the end of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Joint Position Sense of flexion-extension, right-left rotation and right-left lateral flexion movements of the cervical region will be evaluated. A laser marker will be used to perform the assessment. The target angle for cervical flexion, extension and right-left rotation joint position sense measurement is 30°, and 20° for right-left cervical lateral flexion. Measurements will be made with eyes open and eyes closed. Before the JPS evaluations, the method will be explained to the individuals in detail and a sufficient number of trials will be made before the tests. Considering that fatigue may affect the results, all individuals will be warned not to forcefully move their neck and back muscles before the measurement. In order to prevent proprioceptive input, they will be asked to come in comfortable clothes that do not wrap around the neck on the day of their evaluation.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Cervical Joint Range of Motion</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Cervical Joint Range of Motion at the end of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Inclinometer (Baseline Bubble Inclinometer) will be used to evaluate the joint range of motion of the cervical region. Measurements of cervical flexion, extension and right-left lateral flexion will be made in sitting position, and right and left rotation measurements will be made in supine position.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Strength and Endurance of the Deep Cervical Flexor Muscles</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Strength and Endurance of the Deep Cervical Flexor Muscles at the end of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Craniocervical flexion test (CCFT) is used to evaluate the activation and static endurance of the deep flexor muscles of the cervical region. The test will be performed using Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback (Chattanooga Stabilizer). The patient will be positioned in the supine position, with the cervical region in neutral position and the biofeedback pressure unit will be placed in the suboccipital space. The pressure cell will be inflated to 20 mmHg. Then, the individual will be instructed to perform a posterior tilt movement by increasing the pressure at 5 different levels (22, 24, 26, 28 and 30 mmHg.), Following the monitor of the device. After teaching the movement, the person will be asked to perform 10 contractions lasting 10 seconds at each level. The person will move to the next level after each successful attempt.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Static Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Static Balance at the end of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Stork balance test will be used in the evaluation of static balance. While one side is standing on one foot, the individual places the other foot on the inside of the knee on which she/he is standing. She/he places his hands on the waist and, with the signal of the physiotherapist, raises the heel of the supporting leg from the ground. She/he tries to maintain this position as long as he can stand with his eyes open . After the trial, She/he will be told to take this position three times with his eyes open and the holding times will be recorded. The best score of the recorded times will be taken.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Dynamic Balance</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Dynamic Balance at the end of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>It will be evaluated using the Y balance test. The reach distance in the anterior, posteromedial and posterolateral transport directions will be recorded. People will be asked to reach the furthest point with the other foot while trying to maintain balance with the dominant foot on the wooden platform while the hands are on the waist. 3 repetitions of reaching out in 3 directions will be recorded.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Neck Awareness</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Neck Awareness at the end of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Fremantle Neck Awareness Questionnaire will be used to assess neck awareness. Fremantle Neck Awareness Questionnaire is a 9-item questionnaire that evaluates neck perception, attention and proprioceptive awareness of individuals with chronic neck pain. The first 3 questions of the questionnaire, which evaluates awareness in 4 dimensions, evaluate attention, the fourth and fifth questions evaluate proprioceptive perception, and the sixth, seventh and ninth questions evaluate how the neck is perceived as shape and size relative to its body. The eighth question was interpreted as 'negligence'. The questions of the Likert-type questionnaire are between 0 and 4 points, meaning 0=Never, 1=Rarely, 2=Sometimes, 3=Often, 4=Always. The total score is 36. A high score indicates decreased awareness of the neck.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Functional Disability</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from Functional Disability at the end of 8 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Neck Disability Index (BDI) will be used to evaluate the functional disability of the neck. The questionnaire assesses how much neck pain associated with problems in the cervical region affects the individual in daily life and how much it interferes with the individual's daily work. The index consists of 10 items, 4 items evaluating subjective symptoms such as pain intensity, headache, concentration, sleep, and 6 items evaluating daily life activities such as personal care, lifting loads, reading, working life, driving, and leisure activities. Scoring is done between 0-5. The individual is asked to mark the answer that best fits him. If the total score obtained in the index is between 0-4, it is classified as no disability, between 5-14 as mild disability, between 15-24 as moderate disability, between 25-34 as severe disability and above 35 points as total disability.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Patient Satisfaction</measure>
    <time_frame>End of eight weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The Global Perceived Impact (GAE) questionnaire will be used to assess the extent to which individuals benefit from treatment after treatment. This questionnaire is used to evaluate the extent to which individuals benefit from treatment after treatment. Individuals are asked to rate between 1 (very much improved) and 9 (very much worsened) to the question 'How have your complaints changed compared to the time before your treatment?'. Scale scores were, in order, 1-very much improved, 2-very much improved, 3-moderately improved, 4-slightly improved, 5-unchanged, 6-slightly worsened, 7-moderately worsened, 8-very much worsened, 9-very much worsened. is in the form. Scoring will be done once at the end of the treatment.</description>

    <description>First of all, patients will be taught correct craniocervical flexion movement without activation of superficial muscles in different positions (supine, prone, crawling, sitting, standing). The program will be continued by asking to maintain the cranio-cervical flexion position during all movements. In order to gain dynamic stabilization, unilateral, bilateral, contralateral, ipsilateral and reciprocal extremity movements will be added to the program together with craniocervical flexion movement. Resistance will be added to the exercises as control of the movement is achieved. The exercises will progress from static to dynamic, from stationary floors to moving floors, from simple movements to complex movements.</description>
