    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of trazodone as compared to&#xD;
      quetiapine and placebo, in the management of ICU delirium in adult (&gt;=18 years old) surgical&#xD;
      ICU patients. The investigators will compare outcomes such as delirium incidence and&#xD;
      duration, in-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), ICU LOS,&#xD;
      mechanical ventilator days, complications, adverse effects, rescue medication use, delirium&#xD;
      symptom severity, sleep duration, and sleep quality among participants receiving trazodone,&#xD;
      quetiapine, or placebo. The investigators hypothesize participants receiving trazodone will&#xD;
      have a shorter duration of delirium, decreased delirium severity, and improved sleep quality&#xD;
      compared to participants receiving quetiapine and placebo.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, double-blind randomized, placebo-controlled pilot trial comparing&#xD;
      trazodone, quetiapine, and placebo for the treatment of ICU delirium in adult patients&#xD;
      admitted to the surgical ICU at Keck Hospital of the University of Southern California.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the effectiveness of several medications&#xD;
      (trazodone, quetiapine and placebo) used for the treatment of ICU delirium, and their effects&#xD;
      on patient outcomes. Since the incidence of ICU delirium is high and has profound negative&#xD;
      ramifications on survival, long-term outcomes, cognitive function, in addition to placing a&#xD;
      heavy burden on the healthcare system resources and costs, effective delirium treatment&#xD;
      strategies are desperately needed. Trazodone is a medication that has promise in delirium&#xD;
      treatment, but there is currently insufficient literature to recommend its routine use. The&#xD;
      investigators' main objective is to determine if trazodone is an effective and safe treatment&#xD;
      option for the management of ICU delirium, and if it results in shorter delirium duration and&#xD;
      improved outcomes compared to participants receiving quetiapine and placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be screened for study eligibility daily on rounds throughout the study&#xD;
      period. Patients eligible for the study will be asked for written informed consent (signed by&#xD;
      either the patient or the surrogate decision maker) after admission (even if the patient does&#xD;
      not have delirium), or at any point during the ICU course (patient may or may not have a&#xD;
      delirium diagnosis at the time of consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
      ICU nurses will assess all patients for delirium at least every 12 hours, using the CAM-ICU&#xD;
      tool , in accordance with the standard of care in the surgical ICU (that is, this assessment&#xD;
      would be performed regardless of the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who have written informed consent, have a diagnosis of delirium (CAM-ICU positive)&#xD;
      that requires pharmacological intervention as determined by the attending intensivist, and&#xD;
      meet all inclusion criteria and have no exclusion criteria, will be randomized to receive&#xD;
      either trazodone, quetiapine, or placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratification/Randomization Scheme: Patients who are enrolled in the study, meet&#xD;
      randomization inclusion criteria, and have no exclusion criteria, and require a medication&#xD;
      intervention for the treatment of ICU delirium, as determined by the attending ICU physician,&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of three study arms: 1. Trazodone; 2. Quetiapine or; 3. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled patients will be randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to the Trazodone, Quetiapine, or&#xD;
      placebo groups. Randomization will be stratified on age (&lt; vs. ≥65) and delirium severity and&#xD;
      occur in blocks, with block size not revealed to investigators. An independent statistician&#xD;
      from the USC Clinical and Translational Science Institute (CTSI), will generate a&#xD;
      randomization list and import it to REDCap prior to study initiation. Upon confirmation of&#xD;
      informed consent, trial eligibility and completion of the baseline assessment, the patient&#xD;
      will be randomized to one of the study arms using the REDCap randomization module.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon randomization, an automated email notification will be sent to the un-blinded pharmacist&#xD;
      (who is not part of the study team), who securely accesses the randomization module on REDCap&#xD;
      and will prepare numbered supplement bottles according to the randomization list. The&#xD;
      pharmacist will assign and dispense the drug to the ICU nurse who is administering the drug&#xD;
      (and is blinded to the medication). The rest of the study team (PIs, co-PIs, research&#xD;
      assistants, ICU nurses) will be blinded to the therapy being received and they will be&#xD;
      blinded to the randomization and allocation process on REDCap as well, as the allocation and&#xD;
      randomization files will be blinded and securely kept under passcode protection by the&#xD;
      independent pharmacist. The patients will not know which study medication they are receiving.&#xD;
      USC Plaza Pharmacy will prepare the study medications and packaging prior to study&#xD;
      initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Medication Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be standardized method delineating how to begin dosing the study medication, and&#xD;
      how to adjust the dose and frequency as needed. Additionally, there will be standardized&#xD;
      tapering protocol, so there is consistency among all participants. Furthermore, there will be&#xD;
      a standardized rescue medication protocol in place, should patients who are receiving&#xD;
      placebo, or having break through delirium despite intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics/Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determination of sample size: As this is a pilot study, a total sample size of 30 (10 per&#xD;
      treatment group) over an enrollment period of 1 year is estimated to be recruited based on&#xD;
      feasibility. As the primary goal of this pilot study is to identify a signal for treatment&#xD;
      efficacy, sample size considerations are based on the precision (i.e., 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval) with which key trial parameters can be estimated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Baseline descriptive statistics: Baseline characteristics of the study population will be&#xD;
      presented by treatment group using conventional descriptive statistics methods, including&#xD;
      proportions for categorical variables and means and standard deviations or medians and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges for continuous variables, as appropriate based on the data distribution.&#xD;
      Comparisons of baseline variables will be performed between treatment groups by one-way&#xD;
      Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) for continuous variables and chi-square or Fisher's exact tests&#xD;
      for categorical variables, as appropriate. If a statistically significant difference is found&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05) in the ANOVA models, pairwise treatment comparisons will be performed using Tukey's&#xD;
      multiple comparison adjustment. Assumptions of the ANOVA model will be tested including 1)&#xD;
      normality of model residuals, 2) homogeneity of variance, and 3) independence of observations&#xD;
      and if not met, the non-parametric equivalent Kruskal-Wallis test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Analysis of primary endpoints: The primary outcome is the duration of ICU delirium measured&#xD;
      in days. Differences in the duration of delirium between treatment groups will be analyzed by&#xD;
      Poisson regression or negative binomial regression if there is evidence of over-dispersion.&#xD;
      Patients with delirium episodes lasting less than one day will be classified as zero days.&#xD;
      All models will include the randomized group and randomization stratification variables as&#xD;
      independent variables. Model coefficients for each treatment group will be exponentiated to&#xD;
      give the estimated rate ratio of each treatment comparison, with 95% confidence intervals.&#xD;
      The referent group for treatment group comparisons will be the placebo group (i.e., comparing&#xD;
      trazodone to placebo, and quetiapine to placebo). The pairwise comparison of trazodone to&#xD;
      quetiapine will also be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Analysis of secondary endpoints: Binary secondary endpoints include the proportion of&#xD;
      patients with in-hospital mortality, 28-day mortality, who experience complications, and who&#xD;
      use rescue medications. The proportion in each treatment group will be compared univariately&#xD;
      by the chi-square or Fisher's exact test and in a multivariable model by binary logistic&#xD;
      regression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional secondary endpoints include the length of hospital stay, length of ICU stay, and&#xD;
      duration of mechanical ventilation (if applicable). These outcomes will be analyzed as&#xD;
      described in the &quot;analysis of primary endpoint&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial outcomes that are measured daily (delirium severity measured by CAM-S, nightly sleep&#xD;
      duration (hours), number of times awoken at night, and sleep quality (Richards Campbell Sleep&#xD;
      Questionnaire) will be compared among treatment groups using generalized linear mixed effects&#xD;
      models (GLMMs). Normally distributed continuous outcomes will use a normal random outcome&#xD;
      with an identify link function; count outcomes (e.g., number of times awoken) will use a&#xD;
      Poisson random variable with a log link function. For each model, the primary independent&#xD;
      variables will be randomized treatment group and randomization stratification variables.&#xD;
      Assessment time (day of assessment, from day 0 to 14) will be treated as indicator variables.&#xD;
      The main effect of treatment will estimate the mean of the outcome among treatment groups&#xD;
      over the treatment period. An interaction term of treatment-by-day will be used to estimate&#xD;
      treatment group means (with SEs and confidence intervals) by intervention day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Analysis of safety measures: Numbers and percentages of adverse events and serious adverse&#xD;
      events will be cross-tabulated and summarized descriptively by treatment group. No formal&#xD;
      statistical analysis will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Populations for analysis: The full analysis dataset will be based on an intention-to-treat&#xD;
      (ITT) principle and will be comprised of all study participants who have been randomized to&#xD;
      any of the 3 treatment groups. Analysis will be based on the original intervention,&#xD;
      regardless of actual intervention received.&#xD;
