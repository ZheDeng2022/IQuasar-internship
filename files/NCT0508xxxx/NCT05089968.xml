  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In December 2019, a new pandemic emerged, the COVID-19 disease caused by a SARS-Cov-2 virus.&#xD;
      One of the most common symptoms of COVID-19 is mainly respiratory failure and patients&#xD;
      requires assistance by mechanical ventilation. Ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) is a&#xD;
      risk of this assistance. Since the beginning of the pandemic, Standard of care have evolved&#xD;
      with new data. The prevalence of these VAPs seems significantly higher in the population of&#xD;
      patients with ARDS COVID-19 (40-50%) and their ecology seems to have evolved over time,&#xD;
      particularly in terms of bacterial resistance. Investigators want to describe and compare&#xD;
      this evolution of bacterial and fungal ecology as well as identify potential risk factors&#xD;
      that may be associated with these changes in ecology during different waves.&#xD;
