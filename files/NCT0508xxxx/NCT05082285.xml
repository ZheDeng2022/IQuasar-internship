      The purpose of this study is to assess the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of the&#xD;
      combined meningococcal groups A, B, C, W and Y (MenABCWY-2Gen) vaccine intended to protect&#xD;
      against invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) caused by all 5 meningococcal serogroups, in&#xD;
      healthy infants 2 months of age (MoA) at enrolment.&#xD;

    <measure>Percentage of participants with solicited administration site events</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination (vaccines administered on Day 1 and 61 and Day 301)</time_frame>
    <description>The solicited administration site events include tenderness, erythema, induration and swelling.</description>

    <time_frame>During the 7 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination (vaccines administered on Day 1 and 61 and Day 301)</time_frame>
    <description>The solicited systemic events include fever, irritability/fussiness, loss of appetite, drowsiness, vomiting and diarrhoea. Fever is defined as temperature &gt;38.0°C/100.4°F. The preferred location for measuring temperature will be axillary.</description>

    <measure>Percentage of participants with any unsolicited adverse events (AEs), including all medically attended adverse events (MAEs), serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal, and adverse events of special interest (AESIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>During the 30 days (including the day of vaccination) after each vaccination (vaccines administered on Day 1 and 61 and Day 301)</time_frame>
    <description>Unsolicited AEs includes any AE reported in addition to those solicited during the clinical study. Also, any 'solicited' symptom with onset outside the specified period of follow-up for solicited symptoms is reported as an unsolicited adverse event. MAEs are defined as symptoms or illnesses requiring a hospitalization, or an emergency room visit, or visit to/by a health care provider. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that results in death, is life-threatening, requires hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization or results in disability/incapacity. AESIs are predefined (serious or non-serious) AEs of scientific and medical concern specific to the product or program, for which ongoing monitoring and rapid communication by the investigator to the sponsor can be appropriate, because such an event might warrant further investigation in order to characterize and understand it.</description>
