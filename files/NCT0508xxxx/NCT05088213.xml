    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) was the first line choice for the management of renal&#xD;
      calculi larger than 20 mm. A relative large tract of 24-30Fr was widely used in standard PCNL&#xD;
      (sPCNL), which was believed to bring tract-related bleeding. In order to reduce the risk of&#xD;
      tract-related bleeding, Chinese urologists used 18Fr mini-tract in the PCNL procedures, which&#xD;
      was well known as minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy (mini-PCNL). In an&#xD;
      international multi-centre randomized controlled trail (RCT) , mini-PCNL and sPCNL was&#xD;
      compared in the management of 2-4cm kidney stones, the stone free rate (SFR) in mini-PCNL was&#xD;
      equal to that of sPCNL. However, since the tract was smaller, the postoperative pain in&#xD;
      mini-PCNL was less, the postoperative recovery was faster, and the hospital stay was shorter.&#xD;
      Recently, professor Guohua Zeng developed enhanced super-mini-PCNL (eSMP) technique. When&#xD;
      compared to traditional mini-PCNL, suction mini-PCNL using 18Fr suction sheath increased the&#xD;
      stone removal efficiency and reduced the renal pelvic pressure. While in the present regard,&#xD;
      whether suction mini-PCNL play an more efficent and safe role in the management of 2-4cm&#xD;
      kidney stones was worthy of further study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, the investigators would like to have an international multi-centre RCT to certify our&#xD;
      hypothesis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      To certify the efficency and safety of suction mini-PCNL for the management of 2-4cm kidney&#xD;
      stones, an international multi-centre RCT was conducted with the comparision of suction&#xD;
      mini-PCNL and sPCNL. Investigators plan to do an international multi-centre randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial (RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are 22 hospitals included in this study, including The First Affiliated Hospital of&#xD;
      Guangzhou Medical University, Aceves of Wake Forest University Medical Center, University&#xD;
      College London Hospital, San Paolo Hospital, University of Milan, Örebro University, San&#xD;
      Bassiano Hospital, Vicenza, Italy, ALAMIRI Hospital, SABAH ALAHMAD Urology Center, Kuwait,&#xD;
      Biruni University Medical School, İstanbul, Turkey, Jose R. Reyes Memorial Medical Center,&#xD;
      Manila, Philippines, Military Medical Academy, The First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui Medical&#xD;
      University, The First Affiliated Hospital of Chongqing Medical University, Affiliated&#xD;
      Hospital of Zunyi Medical University, The First Affiliated Hospital of Nanchang University,&#xD;
      Renmin Hospital of Wuhan University, Xiangtan Central Hospital, Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan&#xD;
      University, The Jiangxi Provincial People's Hospital, Affiliated Hospital of Guangdong&#xD;
      Medical University, The First people's Hospital of Foshan, Zhuhai people's Hospital,&#xD;
      Nanxishan Hospital of Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study endpoints were stone free rate (SFR) and operation time, while the&#xD;
      secondary study endpoints were lithotripsy time, hemoglobin drop, transfusion, postoperative&#xD;
      fever and other complications, postoperative pain and hospital stay, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be started at August,2021 and ended at August ,2023.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reported SFR following suction mini-PCNL and sPCNL was 83% and 86%，respectively. The&#xD;
      hypothesis was that, the SFR following suction mini-PCNL was higher, or at least not lower&#xD;
      than sPCNL. As a bilateral test, α=0.05, test efficiency 1-β=80%, the minimum sample size of&#xD;
      each group was determined as n=437. When considered the unfavorable factors, such as&#xD;
      withdrawal, n=480 in each group was required, thus the sample size would be 960. In the&#xD;
      alternative plan, the sample size was calculated based on the operation time. The reported&#xD;
      operation time of suction mini-PCNL and sPCNL for the management of 2-4 cm kidney stones was&#xD;
      45±10 and 35±10 min, respectively. The hypothesis was that, the operation time of suction&#xD;
      mini-PCNL was not significantly longer than that of sPCNL. As a bilateral test, α=0.05, the&#xD;
      test efficiency 1-β =80%, the non-inferiority test cutoff value for comparing two groups of&#xD;
      means was taken as 12, n=310 was calculated for each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample demand in the second plan was lower than the first plan according to SFR, thus the&#xD;
      sample size was finally determined as 960.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central randomized allocation method was adopted to arrange cases to the sub-centrres.&#xD;
      According to the previous daily PCNL procedure volume in each centre, the number of cases in&#xD;
      each centre was matched according to the proportion. Ethics committee approval was obtained&#xD;
      at each site and informed consent was taken from each patient. A balanced randomization&#xD;
      method was used to generate a random number table to each package, so as to ensure a well&#xD;
      balance in each centre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality control A standard operating procedure (SOP) was made and approved by the principal&#xD;
      investigator of each center. Routine monitoring visits to all centers were carried out every&#xD;
      month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients received standard preoperative evaluation, including detailed medical history,&#xD;
      physical examination, compete blood count, urinary analysis, midstream urine culture, serum&#xD;
      creatinine, electrolyte biochemical tests, coagulation profiles, blood-borne disease&#xD;
      screening, non-contrast CT, plain radiography (kidney ureter bladder, KUB), plain chest&#xD;
      radiograph, electrocardiogram etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with positive preoperative urine culture should be treated with suitable antibiotics&#xD;
      based on the culture sensitivity result for at least 7d before standard-PCNL/suction&#xD;
      mini-PCNL. Patients who have negative urine culture should receive a single dose of broad&#xD;
      spectrum antibiotic prophylaxis in 30mins prior to the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The potential patients were recruited 3 day before the operation, and the detailed study&#xD;
      protocol, the rights and interests of the subjects were informed. Finally, the patients who&#xD;
      obtained the written informed consent were enrolled into the present study. The choice of&#xD;
      operation mode was based on the corresponding number from the random number table at the time&#xD;
      of patients signed the consent, &quot;0&quot; as the standard-PCNL group, &quot;1&quot; as the suction mini- PCNL&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures was under general anesthesia. After retrograde ureteral catheterization with a&#xD;
      5Fr open-ended catheter, patients were turned to prone position. Under ultrasonography/X-ray&#xD;
      guidance, experienced urologists made the puncture into target calyx with an 18-gauge coaxial&#xD;
      needle, then 0.035-inch guide-wire was inserted. Fascial dilators were used for the dilation,&#xD;
      and the tract was established 18/24Fr by under fluoroscopy guidance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For suction mini-PCNL, 18Fr suction sheath (Weili, China) was inserted, and 12Fr&#xD;
      mini-nephroscope was used, kidney stones was fragmented by pneumatic lithotriptor (LithoClast&#xD;
      Master, Switzerland) or Ho:YAG laser（0.8-1.0W*20-30Hz）, and stone fragments was sucked out&#xD;
      with the suction sheath.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For standard-PCNL, 24-30Fr sheath was inserted, and 20Fr nephroscope (Richard Wolf, Germany)&#xD;
      was used, kidney stones was disintegrated and sucked out by ultrasonic-lithotripter&#xD;
      (LithoClast Master, EMS, Switzerland or ShockPluse-SE, Olympus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the later stage of the procedure, fluoroscopy was performed to detect the residual stone.&#xD;
      Further attempt was made to remove all stone. Double-J stent and/or nephrostomy tube was&#xD;
      inserted. Tubeless PCNL was feasible if there was no residual stones, no bleeding, no&#xD;
      collecting system perforation nor no ureteral obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the stone fragments was collected and the volume of removing stones was evaluated. Stone&#xD;
      compositon analysis was obtained. Complete blood count, electrolyte biochemical tests, were&#xD;
      performed at 8:00 the next morning after surgery. KUB was required on the 2nd postoperative&#xD;
      day to evaluate the stone, stent and tube status. If the stones was completely removed, no&#xD;
      additional procedures was needed, no severe bleeding was noted, the nephrostomy tube was&#xD;
      removed and patients were discharged. If the residual fragments was≧ 4mm, any information&#xD;
      concerning needs for auxiliary treatment should be recorded, including the size of residual&#xD;
      stones, the auxiliary treatment and finial outcome. NCCT was requirted to evaluate the final&#xD;
      SFR on postoperative one month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection and definitions of parameters The characteristics of patients and clinical&#xD;
      outcomes were recorded according to the pre-established case report form (CRF). Surgical&#xD;
      outcomes were predicted preoperatively according to the S·T·O·N·E nephrolithometry. Puncture&#xD;
      guidance（Sonography/X ray/combination）, tract location（lower, middle, upper pole and&#xD;
      supracostal or subracostal）, tract number, lithotripsy tool, tube and setnt (nephrostomy&#xD;
      tube, JJ stent or tubeless). Operation time was defined as the time from puncture to the&#xD;
      placement of the nephrostomy tube. Lithotripsy time was defined as the time for lithotripsy&#xD;
      only. Hospital stay was defined as days between the surgery date and discharge date.&#xD;
      Bruggrmann Comfort Scale (range: 0-5): 0, persistent pain; 1, severe pain while deep&#xD;
      breathing or coughing; 2, mild pain while deep breathing or coughing; 3, no pain while deep&#xD;
      breathing; 4, no pain while coughing. (Ren C et al. Medicine (Baltimore). 2015&#xD;
      Aug;94(32):e1348.). Visual Analogue Scale (range: 1-10): 0, no pain; 1-3, mild; 4-6,&#xD;
      moderate; 7-9, severe; 10, excruciating pain. (Reed MD, Van Nostran W. J Clin Pharmacol. 2014&#xD;
      Mar;54(3):241-4.). Postoperative fever was defined as armpit temperature≥38℃. SIRS was&#xD;
      diagnosed in patients who met two or more of the following clinical findings: ① body&#xD;
      temperature higher than 38℃ or lower than 36℃;② heart rate higher than 90 beats per minute; ③&#xD;
      respiratory rate greater than 20 breaths per minute or PaCO2 less than 32mm Hg; ④ a white&#xD;
      blood cell count higher than 12,000 per mm 3 or lower than 4,000 per mm3. Urosepsis was&#xD;
      diagnosed with SOFA scores. Complications of all patients were recorded according to modified&#xD;
      Clavien classification system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) 22.0 was used for statistical analysis.&#xD;
      Continuous data was recorded as mean ± standard deviation. Normally distributed data was&#xD;
      analyzed with Student's t test, while non-normally distributed data was analyzed with&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test. Categorical data was reported as n (%), and compared with the χ2 test or&#xD;
      Wilcoxon rank sum test. p &lt; 0.05 was regarded as statistically significant.&#xD;
