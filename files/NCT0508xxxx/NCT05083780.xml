  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the 8th most prevalent cancer in Korea, and its 5-year overall survival&#xD;
      rate has shown less than 10% due to its dismal prognosis. To date, the only curative&#xD;
      treatment of pancreatic cancer is surgical resection. However, about 60% of patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer have been diagnosed as a locally advanced unresectable or metastatic&#xD;
      disease at diagnosis owning to its difficulty in the early detection of cancer. The 5-year&#xD;
      survival rate has been reported to be less than 25% even with surgical resection. Considering&#xD;
      the high rate of metastasis and recurrence, systemic chemotherapy is essential to prolong&#xD;
      survival. Therefore, Using AI platforms of RAPTOR (RNA expression-based Anti-symmetrical&#xD;
      Pairing Tool for On-demand Response) and ReDRUG (Restoration using the drug for targeting&#xD;
      unbalanced gene) developed by Oncocross, Chlorphenesin carbamate, and Hydroxychloroquine were&#xD;
      discovered as candidate drugs having anti-metastatic effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of hydroxychloroquine and chlorphenesin&#xD;
      carbamate in combination with mFOLFIRINOX in patients with inoperable locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
