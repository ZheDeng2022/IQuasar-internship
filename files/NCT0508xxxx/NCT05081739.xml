      The study objective is to demonstrate that rejection surveillance of heart transplant&#xD;
      recipients with Prospera dd-cfDNA is non-inferior to rejection surveillance with&#xD;
      endomyocardial biopsy and histology in the first post-transplant year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Subjects will be enrolled into the study while on the transplant waiting list prior to heart&#xD;
      transplantation. All subjects will follow the center's standard of care surveillance schedule&#xD;
      from transplant through 4 post-transplantation. EMB during this phase is expected to occur&#xD;
      roughly weekly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio 30 days (± 7 days) post-transplant to Prospera&#xD;
      surveillance (Study Group) versus EMB surveillance (Control Group, standard clinical care).&#xD;
      Rejection surveillance (Prospera testing in the Study Group and EMB in the Control Group)&#xD;
      will be performed at times corresponding to the institutional standard of care schedule for&#xD;
      rejection surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Group: Prospera Surveillance (300 Subjects) Subjects will undergo Prospera testing at&#xD;
      times corresponding to the institution's graft surveillance schedule. Prospera test results&#xD;
      will be provided to the clinical team. Prospera cfDNA level &lt; 0.15% will be interpreted as&#xD;
      negative and a surveillance EMB will be omitted. Prospera cfDNA ≥ 0.15% will be followed by&#xD;
      EMB. A for-cause EMB can be done per the clinical team's discretion at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group: EMB Surveillance (standard of care) (300 Subjects) Subjects will undergo&#xD;
      surveillance EMB per the institution's standard clinical care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For subjects in both groups, research blood samples will be obtained at the time of each&#xD;
      Prospera or EMB surveillance visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study central laboratory or central review will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Central pathology review (all EMBs in both Groups)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Central testing of DSA (at randomization and months 6 and12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Echocardiography review (at randomization and months 12 for echocardiography component&#xD;
           of primary endpoint)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study intervention will be during the first 12 months post-transplant.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is a composite endpoint defined as the first occurrence of one or more of the following events after transplant:&#xD;
Treated rejection with graft dysfunction and/or graft dysfunction requiring treatment with pulse dose steroids, monoclonal antibodies, plasmapheresis, and/or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg)&#xD;
Treated rejection without graft dysfunction&#xD;
Graft dysfunction&#xD;
Re-transplantation&#xD;
Death&#xD;
Clinical endpoints are defined as follows:&#xD;
Rejection: ISHLT ACR Grade ≥ 2R or AMR Grade ≥ pAMR1&#xD;
Graft dysfunction: LVEF decline &gt;10% from baseline and &lt; 50% absolute LVEF by echocardiography&#xD;
Re-transplantation: being listed for re-transplant or being re-transplanted</description>

    <description>Subjects will undergo Prospera testing in accordance with the institution's Control Group EMB surveillance standard of care schedule, which is expected to be approximately every other week months 2 and 3, then monthly through months 4 through 6, then every 1-3 months during months 7 through 12. Prospera test results will be provided to investigators. Prospera cfDNA level &lt; 0.15 % will be interpreted as negative, and screening EMB will be omitted. EMB will be performed for cfDNA level ≥ 0.15 %. At any time, the clinical team may perform for cause EMB for standard clinical indications (e.g., evidence of graft failure) as per the treating team's discretion. Additional research blood samples will be collected for research purposes; the results of testing performed on research samples will not be provided to investigators.</description>
