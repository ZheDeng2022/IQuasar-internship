    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter observational study of peripheral neuropathies patients aiming at&#xD;
      characterizing multi-muscle synergy and at assessing the effectiveness of a rehabilitation&#xD;
      program driven by multi-muscle synergy organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study can be divided in two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1 will included peripheral neuropathies patients and healthy age-matched subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral neuropathies patients will be assessed with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neurological assessment formalized via Total Neuropathy Score-clinical version (TNSc©)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nerve conduction studies&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Impact of PN on patients' quality of life using Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional status using Functional Independence Measure (FIM)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peripheral neuropathies patients and healthy age-matched subjects will receive a postural&#xD;
      evaluation recording during three different postural tasks (quiet standing, voluntary sway&#xD;
      and shoulder flexion):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  centre of pressure (COP) displacement of force platform;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  surface muscle activation using electromyography (EMG) of 13 muscle on the right side of&#xD;
           the body (tibialis anterior, soleus,gastrocnemius lateralis-medialis, biceps femoris,&#xD;
           semitendinosus, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis and medialis, tensor fasciae latae,&#xD;
           lumbar and thoracic erector spinae and rectus abdominis).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 will included only peripheral neuropathies patients. Participants will be assessed at&#xD;
      baseline, after a 20 session 2-3/w program of physical therapy and at a follow up of 3&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The evaluations of the first phase will be implemented with evaluation of mobility and&#xD;
      balance using Six Minute Walking Test (6MWT), Mini Balance Evaluation System Test&#xD;
      (MiniBESTest) and Timed Up and Go test (TUG).&#xD;

    <measure>Evaluation of multi-muscle synergy organization using Synergy Index (SI)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after the 20th session of the rehabilitation program, follow up at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Multi-muscle Synergy Index (SI) are new measurements of postural stability and a proxy of multi-muscle coordination. Synergy has been defined as a neural organization of a large set of effectors (e.g., muscles) providing stability of salient performance variables (e.g., center of pressure, COP). Within this framework, SI has been introduced, reflecting the relative amount of inter-trial variance that does not affect a performance variable.</description>

    <measure>Evaluation of change in Anticipatory Synergy Adjustments (ASA)</measure>
    <time_frame>At baseline, after the 20th session of the rehabilitation program, follow up at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>ASAs represent changes in an index of a multi-muscle synergy stabilizing the coordinate of the center of pressure (COP). Such changes may be seen in young, healthy persons about 200-300 ms prior to the action initiation.</description>

    <time_frame>At baseline, after the 20th session of the rehabilitation program, follow up at 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation of balance using Mini Balance Evaluation System Test (MiniBESTest). Each item is scored on a 0-4 scale; the scores are summed to obtain a total score of 28. The item are divided in four sessions: anticipatory, reactive postural control, sensory orientation, dynamic gait.</description>

    <description>Evaluation of quality of life using the Short Form Health Survey 36 (SF-36). It is a self-report measure of functional health and well-being. The SF-36 questionnaire consists of eight scales yielding two summary measures: physical and mental health. The physical health measure includes four scales of physical functioning (10 items), role-physical (4 items), bodily pain (2 items), and general health (5 items). The mental health measure is composed of vitality (4 items), social functioning (2 items), role-emotional (3 items), and mental health (5 items).</description>

    <description>Evaluation of level of disability using Functional Independence Measure (FIM). It is an 18-item, seven-level, ordinal scale intended to be sensitive to changes over the course of a comprehensive inpatient medical rehabilitation program.It includes measures of independence for self-care, including sphincter control, transfers, locomotion, communication, and social cognition.</description>
