  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pragmatic, single center, feasibility pilot cluster randomized trial with embedded&#xD;
      individual randomization to evaluate implementation strategies to increase the use of&#xD;
      evidence-based practices to reduce upper gastrointestinal bleeding risk in patients using&#xD;
      combination antithrombotic therapy (including warfarin) and that are managed by the Michigan&#xD;
      Medicine anticoagulation monitoring service.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Assignment to one of two clinician-level implementation strategies will be done at the cluster level according to the identity of the clinician to be contacted. Clinicians will be randomized 1:1 to receive either clinician notification (CN) or clinician notification + nurse facilitation (CN+NF). Patients within each clinician cluster will also be individually randomized to receive a patient activation guide or to a usual care arm.&#xD;
There are 2 arms for each group (patients and clinicians).</intervention_model_description>

    <description>An anticoagulation clinic nurse sends a templated letter to the patient's clinician and identifies the patient as high risk for upper GI bleeding, summarizes options for medication optimization (e.g., discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy or initiation of a proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection), provides a link to guidance on evidence-based use of antiplatelet therapy, and asks that the clinician manage any medication changes.&#xD;
In this arm, patients receive no additional interventions beyond that provided during treatment as usual.</description>

    <description>An anticoagulation clinic nurse sends an individualized letter to the patient's clinician which identifies the patient as high risk for upper GI bleeding and summarizes options for medication optimization (e.g., discontinuation of antiplatelet therapy or initiation of a proton pump inhibitor for gastroprotection), but in addition includes a summary of the patient's history of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and a concise guidance summary on appropriate use of antiplatelet therapy for relevant indications. The anticoagulation nurse will assist with order entry for any new medications and also provide education on medication changes to the patient upon request by the clinician.&#xD;

Patient Activation:&#xD;
An anticoagulation clinic nurse sends the patient an 8-page written guide, either through the patient portal or by mail. The guide provides education on upper GI bleeding risk and encourages patients to talk with their clinician about medication changes to reduce their bleeding risk.</description>
