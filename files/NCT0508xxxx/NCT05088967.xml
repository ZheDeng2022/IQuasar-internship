      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the neoadjuvant therapy efficacy of IBI110 in&#xD;
      combination with sintilimab versus sintilimab based on pathologic complete response (pCR)&#xD;
      rate in stage IIB (primary tumor &gt; 4 cm ) to IIIB (N2 only) subjects with radically&#xD;
