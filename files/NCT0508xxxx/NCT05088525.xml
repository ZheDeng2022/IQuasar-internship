  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Meniscal root tears have been recently recognized to be one of the most common causes for the&#xD;
      progression of arthritis in relatively young patients. The purpose of the study will be to&#xD;
      assess if the addition of a transtibial peripheral stabilization suture helps to decrease&#xD;
      both meniscal extrusion and if it helps to decrease the progression of osteoarthritis of the&#xD;
      medial compartment of the knee in the early timeframe postoperatively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Studies have reported that the most common reason why patients require total knee&#xD;
      arthroplasty before the age of 60 is a neglected or meniscectomized medial meniscus root&#xD;
      tear. Overall, it has been noted that meniscal root repairs are cost effective and that the&#xD;
      outcomes of meniscus root repairs are demonstrating patients have a significant improvement&#xD;
      of their preoperative symptoms up to several years after surgery. Because most centers have&#xD;
      only been preforming meniscus root repairs over the last five to ten years, we are now&#xD;
      starting to recognize why some of the repairs do not function as well as others. The number&#xD;
      one reason appears to be due to a postoperative meniscus extrusion. Meniscus extrusion has&#xD;
      been seen in up to 50% of postoperative patients, and biomechanical studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      that the cushioning effect of the medial meniscus does not function as well when there is a&#xD;
      meniscus extrusion present. New biomechanical studies have demonstrated that the addition of&#xD;
      a peripheral stabilization suture at the far posteromedial aspect of the medial tibial&#xD;
      plateau helps to hold the meniscus better in the joint and that it also results in a&#xD;
      significant decrease in load on the medial compartment. However, clinical studies are lacking&#xD;
      to date as to whether a peripheral stabilization suture may or may not improve the protected&#xD;
      function of the medial meniscus, decreased extrusion, and potentially lead to a less amount&#xD;
      of progression of osteoarthritis in the medial compartment of the knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this study strives to both assess the ability of a meniscus root repair to slow&#xD;
      down the progression of arthritis of the medial compartment of patients with a 7-Tesla MRI&#xD;
      scanner and also to concurrently assess the ability of the usage of a transtibial peripheral&#xD;
      stabilization suture to decrease or eliminate meniscal extrusion. The importance of this&#xD;
      study is that if the peripheral stabilization suture is noted to both decrease the&#xD;
      progression of arthritis and also to decrease the meniscus extrusion, it will be a&#xD;
      significant step forward in the treatment of these complex meniscal tears.&#xD;

    <description>VR-12 includes 12 original question items from the VR-36. The questions in this survey correspond to seven different health domains: general health perceptions, physical functioning, role limitations due to physical and emotional problems, bodily pain, energy/fatigue levels, social functioning and mental health. Answers are summarized into two scores, a Physical Component Score (PCS) and a Mental Component Score (MCS) which then provides an important contrast between the respondents' physical and psychological health status.
