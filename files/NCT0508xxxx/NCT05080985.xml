  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is planned to be a single-center randomized, prospective double-blind study and&#xD;
      includes patients who planned to be done unilateral MRM (modified radical mastectomy)&#xD;
      operation in Istanbul University Istanbul Faculty of Medicine. The objective of this study is&#xD;
      to compare postoperative analgesic efficacies of TPVB (thoracic paravertebral block) and ESPB&#xD;
      (erector spinae plane block) performed under ultrasound (USG) guidance after MRM. Primary&#xD;
      outcome of this study is postoperative 24-hour morphine consumption whereas secondary&#xD;
      outcomes were planned as the comparison of changes in hemodynamic parameters and numeric&#xD;
      rating pain score (NRS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 86 patients were randomized into TPVB (Group P) and ESPB (Group E) by using closed&#xD;
      envelopes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients in the operating room has same anesthetic management under standard monitoring&#xD;
      modalities. Prior to regional technique, mild sedation was achieved with midazolam (1-2 mg)&#xD;
      and fentanyl (50 mcg). Both blocks were performed under ultrasonography guidance from the&#xD;
      level of T4 vertebra with a linear probe (5MHz; GE Healthcare, Wauwatosa, Wis, USA) using&#xD;
      longitudinally out-of-plane technique by an anesthesiologist. A 22-gauge, 50 mm insulated&#xD;
      stimulating needle was used.By using reference points of C7 and T7, spinous processes of&#xD;
      thoracic vertebras were marked. 10% povidone iodine was used for skin antisepsis. USG probe&#xD;
      was longitudinally placed at the level of T4. Staff anesthesiologist had to visualize of&#xD;
      adjacent muscles, transverse process (TP) and pleura.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For ESPB; confirmation of the needle position was achieved with spread of 2 ml saline between&#xD;
      the deep fascia of the erector spinae muscle and the TP. After negative aspiration 20 ml&#xD;
      0.375% bupivacaine was injected with appropriate distribution of LA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For TPVB; the needle was advanced passing over superior costotransverse ligament and target&#xD;
      space was confirmed by the downward displacement of pleura after the administration of 2 ml&#xD;
      0.9% NaCl. After negative aspiration, 20 ml 0.375 % bupivacaine was injected with appropriate&#xD;
      distribution of local anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular puncture, haematoma, neuraxial injury and pneumothorax were defined as block&#xD;
      complications and should be noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 minutes after the block achieved, pinprick test was performed on both mid-axillary and&#xD;
      midclavicular lines from T1 to T12 (0 there is sensation, 1 decreased sensation, 2 there is&#xD;
      no sensation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthesia induction was unique for all patients with 0.03 mg kg-1 midazolam, 0.5 mcg kg-1&#xD;
      fentanyl, 2 mg kg-1 propofol and 0.6 mg kg-1 rocuronium. Maintenance was achieved with&#xD;
      sevoflurane of 1 minimum alveolar concentration in a mixture of 40% O2 and 60% N2O. As a&#xD;
      component of multimodal analgesia, paracetamol (1 gr) was applied to all patients before skin&#xD;
      incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hemodynamic data were recorded throughout surgery. An increase more than 20% from baseline in&#xD;
      mean arterial pressure (MAP) was defined as inadequate analgesia and was treated with bolus&#xD;
      fentanyl (50 mcg). Hypotension was described with a decrease more than 20% in MAP and treated&#xD;
      with ephedrine bolus. Bradycardia was determined with a heart rate (HR) less than 50 beats&#xD;
      min-1 and treated with atropine. At the end of surgery, the patients were extubated in&#xD;
      operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesia was achieved with IV morphine via Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA)&#xD;
      for 24 hours (0.01 mg kg-1 h-1 basal infusion, 1 mg bolus, 20 minutes lock-out time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative follow-up included hemodynamic variables as well as pain scores and morphine&#xD;
      consumption. Adequate analgesia at rest (static) and at moving of the arm interpreted as&#xD;
      45-90 degree abduction (dynamic) was investigated with Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) at 30th&#xD;
      minute and 1st, 4th, 6th, 12th, 24th hours postoperatively. When NRS was 4 and higher,&#xD;
      tramadol should be administered as rescue analgesic. In case of insufficient pain control at&#xD;
      30th minute, dermatomal analgesia should be assessed for both mid-axillary and midclavicular&#xD;
      lines from T1 to T8 by pinprick test (0 there is sensation, 1 decreased sensation, 2 there is&#xD;
      no sensation). Morphine consumption was evaluated at same study times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications were determined as sedation assessed by Ramsey scale, postoperative nausea-&#xD;
      vomiting (PONV) assessed with the four-point categorical scale (0=no PONV, 1=mild nausea,&#xD;
      2=severe nausea or vomiting once, and 3=vomiting more than once). Severe vomiting should be&#xD;
      treated in a multimodal way and excluded from the study (category 2,3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Staff anesthesiologist responsible for operative course did not contribute in analgesia&#xD;
      assessment, nor in other postoperative follow-up. Other investigators who were blinded to&#xD;
      operative management, collected postoperative data.&#xD;
