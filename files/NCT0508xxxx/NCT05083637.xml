      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Burden:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Globally, an estimated 14.3 million under-5 children are severely malnourished. Two-thirds of&#xD;
      them live in Asian countries, including Bangladesh. Acute malnutrition is an underlying cause&#xD;
      of nearly half of global deaths in under-5 children despite standardized rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocols. It is also associated with high relapse rates following discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Knowledge Gap:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malnourished children suffer from deficiencies of several essential nutrients. Studies showed&#xD;
      that malnourished children had lower serum carnitine levels and demonstrated its role in the&#xD;
      rate of weight gain in children with severe acute malnutrition (SAM). The consequences of&#xD;
      nutritional impairment can be perilous if carnitine deficiency is coupled with Environmental&#xD;
      Enteric Dysfunction (EED). Recent evidence confirms that EED is characterized by secondary&#xD;
      carnitine deficiency in children. Carnitine deficiency leading to EED may cause childhood&#xD;
      growth faltering and impaired cognitive development. However, evidence on carnitine status&#xD;
      and its consequences in relation to EED in diarrheal children with SAM is very limited in&#xD;
      Bangladesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relevance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Such lack of information regarding the role of L-carnitine in improving the rate of weight&#xD;
      gain in malnourished children susceptible to EED is an obstacle in limiting the relapse and&#xD;
      adverse consequences of SAM in diarrheal children living in resource-limited countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: L- carnitine supplementation for 15 days in children with SAM will improve the&#xD;
      rate of weight gain and biomarkers of EED&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To investigate the role of L-carnitine supplementation on the rate of weight gain among&#xD;
           the children with SAM&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To investigate the role of L-carnitine supplementation on the duration of the hospital&#xD;
           stays&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To examine the role of L-carnitine supplementation on EED biomarkers, for instance,&#xD;
           myeloperoxidase (MPO), neopterin (NEO), alpha-1 anti-trypsin (A1AT), kynurenine:&#xD;
           tryptophan (KT) ratio, and citrulline in children with SAM&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This study will be a double-blinded, placebo-controlled randomized clinical trial&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be done in the Dhaka Hospital at icddr,b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigator will enroll diarrheal children with SAM aged 9-24 months of&#xD;
      both genders attending longer stay units (LSU).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study duration: 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening, Consenting, and Baseline Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research staff ( Field Research Assistant) will screen all the participants within the&#xD;
      defined age groups according to the eligibility criteria (Detailed inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are provided separately below). Then research staff will explain the study in&#xD;
      detail, answer any questions from the parent(s), and invite the parent(s) to enroll the child&#xD;
      in the study. If the parent(s) are interested in volunteering in the study, the designated&#xD;
      staff will proceed to consent consisting of a thorough review of the written consent form in&#xD;
      a manner appropriate for the child's parents' literacy level. Prior to signing the consent&#xD;
      form, parent(s) will have an opportunity to ask any questions about the study participants&#xD;
      fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be brought to the study physician for clinical&#xD;
      assessment. If the parent(s) are not sufficiently literate to read and/or sign the consent&#xD;
      form, consenting and fingerprint signature will be obtained in the presence of a witness who&#xD;
      is not associated with the study. The child's parent(s) will be provided with a copy of the&#xD;
      signed consent form. Upon signing a written informed consent, the participant will be&#xD;
      enrolled by the study physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be assigned to the intervention or the control arm using permuted block&#xD;
      randomization method with concealment to ensure that the allocation is not made before the&#xD;
      participant has given their consent and joined the study. A random allocation sequence will&#xD;
      be generated using a computerized random allocation system for permuted block randomization&#xD;
      to ensure comparable allocation numbers at certain equally spaced points in the sequence of&#xD;
      patient assignments. A parallel type of randomization will be used. Reasonably large blocks&#xD;
      with variable block sizes will be constructed to reduce the predictability. Random assignment&#xD;
      will be prepared in advance by an independent researcher from icddr,b, who has no involvement&#xD;
      with the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometric measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the measurements will be taken at enrollment and each day when the participants will&#xD;
      receive intervention/placebo. Trained staff will take all the measures as per the standard&#xD;
      operating procedures (SOPs) and keep records in standard CRFs. The Seca weighing scale will&#xD;
      be used for weight measurement in kg, and the Seca length board will be used for length&#xD;
      measurement in cm. And mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) will be measured in cm using a&#xD;
      non-stretch tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will be given to the child along with the standard of treatment at the&#xD;
      nutritional rehabilitation unit (NRU). Detailed information about the investigational product&#xD;
      is provided separately below. Children will be monitored daily by trained physicians for any&#xD;
      side effects/adverse events (such as nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, rash, urticaria, or any&#xD;
      significant changes in clinical status). If any adverse events are observed, children will be&#xD;
      treated using appropriate management practices at Dhaka Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological sample collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will collect blood, stool, and urine from the participants at enrolment and&#xD;
      at the end of the nutrition intervention. Overall, 5 ml of whole venous blood will be&#xD;
      collected aseptically from each of the participants as per the SOPs. The blood biomarkers&#xD;
      that will be tested in this study are L-carnitine, Citrulline, KT Ratio, C-reactive protein&#xD;
      (CRP), and Alpha-1-acid glycoprotein (AGP). CRP is an acute-phase protein and can be detected&#xD;
      during infection. Increased level of AGP in serum indicates systemic tissue injury,&#xD;
      inflammation, and infection. Both Citrulline and KT ratios indicate EED in children. The&#xD;
      stool will be collected to investigate the concentrations of MPO, NEO, and A1AT in the fecal&#xD;
      samples. The investigators will measure L-carnitine levels in the urine samples of each&#xD;
      participant. All the assays will be done at icddr,b.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laboratory Investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will measure L-carnitine levels in plasma and urine and EED biomarkers in&#xD;
      every enrolled patient. Pre and post-test will be done. The pre-test will be on the first day&#xD;
      of enrolment, and the post-test will be on the 15th day after the completion of&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is estimated considering the primary outcome variable. For the primary&#xD;
      objective, the investigators have considered an intervention study in Turkey. The study&#xD;
      discovered that the mean difference between the rate of weight gain in malnourished children&#xD;
      after L-carnitine supplementation was 2.4 (The weight was measured in kg) with a standard&#xD;
      deviation of 4.3. Setting the level of confidence at 95% (Z1-α =1.645) and the study power at&#xD;
      80%, the estimated sample size is 49 participants in each group with a 10% attrition rate.&#xD;
      So, the total sample size for this study will be 98.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be entered into the pre-tested case record forms (CRFs) using Statistical Package&#xD;
      for the Social Sciences (SPSS 20.0 version) and finally cleaned with a repeated check. Data&#xD;
      will be presented using frequency with percentages for categorical variables. Mean with&#xD;
      standard deviation will be used for symmetrical continuous variables. Median with&#xD;
      interquartile range will be used for asymmetrical numeric variables. To know the outcome of&#xD;
      the intervention in our study children bivariate, crude analyses of the association will be&#xD;
      done that will involve Chi-square or Fisher's exact test for comparing differences in&#xD;
      proportion and t-tests for numeric variables between the groups. Nonparametric continuous&#xD;
      data will be analyzed by Mann-Whitney U-test. Results from all children will be included in&#xD;
      the analysis of the study on an intention-to-treat basis. Data from children withdrawn&#xD;
      because of failure to respond, or voluntary dropouts will be included in the analysis up to&#xD;
      the time of withdrawal. A supplementary analysis excluding the children withdrawn may also be&#xD;
      done. A probability of less than 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.&#xD;
