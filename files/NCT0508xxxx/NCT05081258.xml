  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Orofacial clefts are the second most common birth deformity and vary in etiology and&#xD;
      phenotype, e.g. isolated cleft palate, cleft lip or cleft lip palate. Especially newborns&#xD;
      with unilateral complete cleft lip and palate (UCLP) present severe facial asymmetries auch&#xD;
      as a broad and flat ala of the nose, a deviation of the columella and the philtrum to the non&#xD;
      cleft side. Since postnatal asymmetries can even remain after surgical lip closure in a&#xD;
      alleviated shape, therapeutic presurgical orthodontic approaches to improve symmetrie of the&#xD;
      nose and to achieve ideal conditions for lip surgery are essential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Presurgical orthodontic treatment for newborns with UCLP start within the first days after&#xD;
      birth to separate oral and nasal cavitiy, to improve breathing and feeding and to regulate&#xD;
      growth of the maxillary segments using passive appliances (passive Alveolar Molding (pAM)).&#xD;
      An advanced and widely spread concept is the Nasoalveolar Molding (NAM) by Grayson, which was&#xD;
      first introduced in 1993 as a palate plate combined with a nasal stent as a non-invasive&#xD;
      presurgical appliance to stimulate growth of the nose and use the postnatal potential to&#xD;
      modulate the nasal cartilage. The aim of the NAM therapy is to reduce nasal width, to reduce&#xD;
      deviation of the columella to the non cleft side and to increase nostril height. However, due&#xD;
      to inhomogeneous study designs and results, so far only a slightly positive effect using NAM&#xD;
      therapy could be detected and prospective, randomized clinical trials are necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to analyse and to compare the effects of pAM versus NAM treatment in&#xD;
      newborns with UCLP in the first year of life. The following parameters will be analysed on&#xD;
      defined study time points: nostril width, nasal morphology, cleft width, maxillary growth,&#xD;
      statical and dynamical facial asymmetries and facial perception.&#xD;

Asymmetries are the distances (mm) of the corresponding Points, which would be 0mm in perfect symmetry.&#xD;
The following points will be placed: S = Superciliar Point, Exocanthion; Endocanthion; Zygion; Glabella; Nasion; Pronasale; Subnasale; Pogonion; Subalare; Alare; Cheilion; Labrale superius; Labrale inferius; Crista philtri and Lip Points (median, lateral, corresponding points).</description>

    <description>Facial perception will be rated using 3 pictures photographs / processed photographs of each newborn with UCLP within the first weeks after birth, after insertion of first appliance and until surgical lip closure (without NAM appliance, with NAM appliance, without cleft processed using photoshop). The pictures will be rated from laypersons using a 10-point-rating scale ranging from 1 to 10.&#xD;
1 = highest attractiveness (greatest positive emotional valance) 10 = least attactiveness / Aversion (greatest negative emotional valence).</description>
