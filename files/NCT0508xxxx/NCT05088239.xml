      Background: There is no consensus on the duration of prophylactic antibiotics for autologous&#xD;
      breast reconstruction after mastectomy. We try to standardize prophylactic antibiotics use&#xD;
      during breast reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric perforator flap following&#xD;
      mastectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: This retrospective case series involved 108 patients who underwent immediate breast&#xD;
      reconstruction with deep inferior epigastric perforator flap in Ditmanson Medical Foundation&#xD;
      Chia-Yi Christian Hospital between 2012 and 2019. Patients were divided into three groups&#xD;
      based on prophylactic antibiotic duration: 1 day, 3 days and &gt;7 days for patients with drains&#xD;
      Data were analyzed between January and April, 2021.&#xD;
