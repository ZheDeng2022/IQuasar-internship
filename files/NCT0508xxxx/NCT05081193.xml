      Previous studies of high dose testosterone therapy given intramuscularly to men with&#xD;
      metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer suggest that high serum levels of testosterone&#xD;
      may be required for clinical response. This injection regimen was given as one dose of 400mg&#xD;
      injection every 28 days, which initially produces high serum testosterone levels but these&#xD;
      levels drop to a varying degree in some men over the 28-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this 30 patient trial will analyze the effects of oral testosterone therapy in men with&#xD;
      metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer taken on a schedule of seven days of oral&#xD;
      testosterone therapy followed by seven days of no therapy for a twenty-eight day cycle. This&#xD;
      therapy will be given for three 28 day cycles consecutively followed by radiographic scans to&#xD;
      evaluate the metastatic disease. Patients will be allowed to continue on this therapy until&#xD;
      the patients show signs of radiographic progression. If the patients show signs of&#xD;
      radiographic progression after the first three cycles, the patients will stop taking the oral&#xD;
      testosterone therapy and begin taking enzalutamide therapy. Enzalutamide therapy will be&#xD;
      taken for three 28 day cycles, then radiographic scans will be taken. If there are no signs&#xD;
      of radiographic progression, patients can continue to take enzalutamide therapy for an&#xD;
      additional 3 cycles while on study. Patients with continued PSA or objective response will&#xD;
      come off study but continue on enzalutamide as standard of care therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will help the investigators to understand if treating these men with the highest&#xD;
      FDA approved dose of oral testosterone therapy will achieve similar and sustained high levels&#xD;
      of serum testosterone that will produce similar or enhanced therapeutic response to the&#xD;
      therapy when compared to the serum testosterone levels found in the previous injection&#xD;
      therapy trials.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Metastatic prostate cancer is a highly significant disease that claims the lives of&#xD;
      approximately 30,000 American men each year. Androgen Deprivation Therapy (ADT) is initially&#xD;
      very effective but is never curative as all men eventually develop castrate resistant&#xD;
      prostate cancer (CRPC). A major factor driving resistance is the ability of prostate cancer&#xD;
      (PCa) cells to adapt to the chronic low androgen conditions by upregulating androgen receptor&#xD;
      (AR) activity through overexpression, gene amplification and expression of truncated,&#xD;
      transcriptionally active AR variants that lack the ligand-binding domain. Persistent&#xD;
      signaling through AR makes CRPC sensitive to more potent inhibition of AR by abiraterone&#xD;
      acetate or second generation anti-androgens such as enzalutamide. Yet these therapies have a&#xD;
      limited duration of benefit prior to development of resistance, often through further&#xD;
      increase in AR levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While this marked upregulation of AR can drive resistance, the investigators have&#xD;
      demonstrated that it also creates a therapeutic vulnerability to exposure to high levels of&#xD;
      androgen. However, the investigators have also found that sustained exposure of CRPC to&#xD;
      supraphysiological levels of androgens results in downregulation of AR and acquired&#xD;
      resistance to this therapy. Therefore the investigators have developed a therapy called&#xD;
      Bipolar Androgen Therapy (BAT) in which testosteronecypionate 400 mg IM is administered every&#xD;
      28 days to result in cycling from supraphysiological (&gt;1500 ng/dL) to near-castrate levels.&#xD;
      The rationale for cycling was that high serum T would kill high AR expressing CRPC while low&#xD;
      serum T would prevent adaptation to high T and kill low AR expressing CRPC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date the investigators have treated approximately 250 men with BAT across four completed&#xD;
      studies in asymptomatic men with CRPC. The key findings have been that BAT: (a) could be&#xD;
      safely administered; (b) did not produce symptomatic disease progression; (c) produced&#xD;
      sustained PSA and objective responses in approximately 30-40% of patients; (d) re-sensitized&#xD;
      and prolonged response of patients to subsequent antiandrogen therapy. While ADT for advanced&#xD;
      PCa often produces debilitating sexual and metabolic side effects, another highly significant&#xD;
      feature of this approach is that BAT can make men feel remarkably better by decreasing&#xD;
      fatigue, increasing physical activity and restoring libido and sexual function. BAT also&#xD;
      produced favorable effects on body composition by increasing skeletal muscle mass and&#xD;
      decreasing subcutaneous and visceral fat. Thus, incorporation of BAT into the treatment&#xD;
      paradigm has the potential to improve the quality of life and well-being of PCa patients and&#xD;
      minimize the morbidity from the metabolic sequelae produced by androgen ablative therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The studies performed to date demonstrate the safety and efficacy of high dose T in men with&#xD;
      metastatic CRPC who are progressing on androgen ablative therapy. The investigators' limited&#xD;
      data suggests that high serum levels of T may be required for clinical response. This high&#xD;
      level has is achieved through intramuscular (IM) administration of testosterone cypionate at&#xD;
      the highest FDA-approved dose of 400 mg every 28 days. This regimen initially produces high&#xD;
      serum T levels but these levels drop to a varying degrees approaching near castrate levels in&#xD;
      some men over a 28-day cycle. To date, the investigators have not tested whether more rapid&#xD;
      cycling of serum T would produce similar or improved therapeutic response in this patient&#xD;
      population. Additional issues with IM testosterone are (1) it requires patients to come to&#xD;
      hospital every 28 days for injection, (2) has highly variable pharmacokinetics, (3) can cause&#xD;
      physical discomfort from IM injections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently two novel oral testosterone (OT) agents were developed for the treatment of male&#xD;
      hypogonadism. Historically, an oral option for testosterone replacement therapy was&#xD;
      unavailable because of risks of liver toxicity, including cholestasis and jaundice,&#xD;
      associated with earlier developed 17-alpha-alkylated oral analogs. These novel oral agents&#xD;
      feature specialized formulations that avoid adverse hepatic effects. In clinical trials, both&#xD;
      oral agents produced no significant adverse effects on liver function tests. The&#xD;
      investigators have formed a collaborative partnership with Clarus Therapeutics, the makers of&#xD;
      Jatenzo, an oral lipoprotein-coated testosterone undecanoate (OT) formulation that was&#xD;
      FDA-approved in December 2019 as T-replacement therapy. Published pharmacokinetic data&#xD;
      demonstrate that OT can produce supraphysiologic serum T levels when administered at the&#xD;
      highest FDA-approved dose. Therefore, the investigators' hypothesis is that OT, given at the&#xD;
      highest FDA approved dose, will achieve more homogeneous and sustained supraphysiologic&#xD;
      levels of serum T that will produce similar or enhanced therapeutic response. To avoid&#xD;
      adaptation of CRPC to this sustained level of T, the investigators will utilize a dosing&#xD;
      schedule of 1 week-on, 1 week-off.&#xD;
