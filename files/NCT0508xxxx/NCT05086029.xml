      This study aimed to investigate median nerve hypervasculatitation in psoriatic arthritis&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome(CTS), a type of median nerve neuropathies, is the most common&#xD;
      peripheral nerve entrapment syndrome. Most cases are idiopathic but CTS can be associated&#xD;
      with rheumatologic disorders. There isn't any gold standard technique in diagnosis of CTS.&#xD;
      Electrodiagnostic studies (EDS) are usually performed to confirm diagnose, to differentiate&#xD;
      other diseases or to detect severity. But EDS have some disadvantages such as EDS are time&#xD;
      consuming, uncomfortable, may require interventional procedures, can not directly assess the&#xD;
      anatomy of the median nerve and its surrounding structures. For these reasons, the use of&#xD;
      ultrasonography (US) in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome has been investigated for a&#xD;
      long time. Most of them focused on the cross-sectional area(CSA) of median nerve. Fewer&#xD;
      studies have investigated the vascularity of the median nerve. But there is conflict results&#xD;
      because conventional Doppler techniques may fail to show small vessels or slow blood flow.&#xD;
      Superb microvascular imaging (SMI) is a new ultrasound technology that can diferentiate blood&#xD;
      flow signals from artifacts by using a new algorithm. In carpal tunnel syndrome&#xD;
      hypervasularitation of median nerve has showed by SMI. To our best knowledge, there isn't any&#xD;
      study assessing median nerve hypervascularity by using SMI in PsA. So we aimed to investigate&#xD;
      median nerve hypervasculatitation in psoriatic arthritis (PsA) patients with CTS or without&#xD;
      CTS by using SMI, then compare them with normal people.&#xD;
