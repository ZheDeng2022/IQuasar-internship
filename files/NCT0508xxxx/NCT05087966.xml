    <textblock>
      The overarching goal of this study is to develop a suicide prevention program for&#xD;
      sexual-and-gender-minority youth and emerging adults. After development of the intervention&#xD;
      program, an open phase trial will be conducted to test its feasibility, acceptability, and&#xD;
      preliminary impact on three intervention targets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death among all U.S. citizens, and is the 2nd leading&#xD;
      cause of death among youth and emerging adults between the ages of 15 and 34. Moreover, U.S.&#xD;
      representative data indicate increasing trends in suicide attempts and death by suicide. In&#xD;
      addition to the immense psychological burden experienced by the family and friends of&#xD;
      individuals who attempt and complete suicide, the costs of death by suicide and suicide&#xD;
      attempts in 2013 were estimated at $93.5 billion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group that is particularly vulnerable to suicide is sexual and gender minorities (SGMs).&#xD;
      SGM is an umbrella term used to describe individuals who identify as non-exclusively&#xD;
      heterosexual (e.g., gay, lesbian, bisexual) and/or as transgender/non-binary (e.g., identify&#xD;
      as a gender different from their birth sex). Extant research consistently notes substantial&#xD;
      mental health disparities among SGMs in comparison to their heterosexual and cis-gender&#xD;
      counterparts. In 2017, in the U.S., 23% of sexual minority youth reported one or more suicide&#xD;
      attempts (in the past 12 months) vs. 5.4% of heterosexual youth. This disparity has also been&#xD;
      noted in a meta-analysis of population-based longitudinal studies, with sexual minority&#xD;
      adolescents and emerging adults reporting 2.26 increased odds of suicide attempts compared to&#xD;
      their heterosexual counterparts. Prevalence of lifetime suicide attempts among gender&#xD;
      minorities is also substantially elevated compared to the general population, with 45% of&#xD;
      18-24-year-old transgender individuals reporting history of one or more suicide attempts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these substantial health disparities in suicide among SGM youth/emerging adults, no&#xD;
      known suicide prevention programs exist for this highly vulnerable population. Given this&#xD;
      crucial gap in the literature, the proposed study will adapt and test a patient navigation&#xD;
      (PN) intervention for SGM youth/emerging adults designed to target mechanisms (i.e.,&#xD;
      decreasing thwarted belongingness and increasing suicide-related coping skills) that&#xD;
      theoretically underlie suicide. The proposed intervention will integrate a single-session,&#xD;
      empirically supported, suicide prevention intervention (Safety Planning Intervention; SPI)&#xD;
      with PN services (PN+SPI). The patient navigator will deliver the SPI and continue frequent&#xD;
      contact for the purpose of providing motivational enhancement, problem-solving, reinforcing&#xD;
      coping strategies, and connecting participants to social support and mental health resources&#xD;
      (e.g., SGM-specific support groups within the community). This study will accomplish the&#xD;
      following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To adapt and test an integrated PN+SPI designed to reduce suicide attempts&#xD;
      among SGM youth and emerging adults. In this open-phase trial (N = 30), within-person changes&#xD;
      in thwarted belongingness and suicide-related coping skills will be tested. It is&#xD;
      hypothesized that PN+SPI participants will display decreases in thwarted belongingness and&#xD;
      increases in suicide-related coping skills. Feasibility and acceptability of the PN+ SPI&#xD;
      intervention will also be assessed.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>A broad recruitment strategy will be used to recruit participants within the greater San Diego. Potential participants will be requested to contact study personnel via email or telephone. A trained member of the study team will contact each potential participant to explain the study, obtain verbal consent for pre-enrollment screening, and conduct the screening process. For those who meet screening criteria, a trained member of the study team will provide more information about the study and engage in an informed consent process at an in-person appointment. Following informed consent, participants will complete self-report questionnaires and clinician-based interviews in person. At baseline, 3-month, and 6-month follow-ups, participants will be asked to complete measures of suicidal coping and thwarted belongingness. At the 3- and 6-month follow-up, satisfaction with mental health services and satisfaction with interpersonal relationship with patient navigator will be assessed.</intervention_model_description>
