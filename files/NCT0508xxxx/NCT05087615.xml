  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-operative nausea and vomiting (PONV) is one of the leading causes of patient morbidity&#xD;
      after laparoscopic bariatric surgeries. A wide variety of complications related to PONV has&#xD;
      been described, such as prolonged length of stay (LOS) in hospital, unnecessary readmissions,&#xD;
      delay in oral intake, and bad experience for patients. Although several antiemetic regimens&#xD;
      have been tried so far in different studies, the incidence of PONV is not significantly&#xD;
      lowered, and it seems that it is impossible to totally eliminate it. On the other hand, the&#xD;
      implementation of Enhanced Recovery After Surgery (ERAS) has greatly reduced the incidence of&#xD;
      PONV and LOS. Therefore, a combination of ERAS and multiple antiemetic regimens is currently&#xD;
      used to reduce the incidence of PONV. Nevertheless, the optimal regimen has not been found&#xD;
      yet, and many trials are conducting to find out the best antiemetic regimen. In this&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial, we compare four different combined and single regimens alongside&#xD;
      the implementation of ERAS to show which regimen is more effective.&#xD;

      After being approved by Iran National Committee for Ethics in Biomedical Research&#xD;
      (IR.SBMU.MSP.REC.1399.784), a randomized clinical controlled trial was started with 130&#xD;
      patients in five groups. All the patients were proper candidates for laparoscopic bariatric&#xD;
      surgeries, and structured informed consent was obtained from all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the operations were performed by board certified advanced laparoscopic surgeons in a&#xD;
      minimally invasive educational center. All bariatric surgery was performed in our&#xD;
      standardized institutional protocols as well as preoperative and postoperative care. Sleeve&#xD;
      Gastrectomy (SG) surgeries were performed by using 44Fr Tubes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To calculate the sample size in the clinical trial, we used the ANCOVA method with web-based&#xD;
      tools. Twenty-six patients were estimated for each group. Patients were divided into five&#xD;
      groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1: Patients who did not receive any antiemetic during hospitalization (NA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 2: Patients receiving metoclopramide alone (MA). Group 3: Patients who received&#xD;
      ondansetron only. (OA) Group 4: Patients receiving a combination of metoclopramide and&#xD;
      ondansetron (MO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 5: Patients who received granisetron alone (GA). All patients were undergone ERAS&#xD;
      protocols. In cases where the patient had PONV (including Group 1), intravenous&#xD;
      Metoclopramide 0.2mg (Stat and BiD) was used as a rescue antiemetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To reduce the incidence of bias and confounding factors, all anesthetics and antiemetics used&#xD;
      were provided from the same brand for each drug (see Appendix).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe or moderate gastritis or duodenitis on esophagogastroduodenoscopy were&#xD;
      excluded from the study, but patients with mild gastritis or positive rapid urease test on&#xD;
      endoscopy, were treated for two weeks with three drugs of pentazole, amoxicillin, and&#xD;
      metronidazole, and if the respiratory urease test was negative, they were included in the&#xD;
      study and in refractory cases of H. Pylori, they were excluded. According to the American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, patients with severe respiratory or&#xD;
      cardiovascular problems (ASA III or higher) or a history of gastric or small bowel surgery&#xD;
      were also excluded. Patients who underwent simultaneous cholecystectomy with bariatric&#xD;
      surgery were also excluded.&#xD;
