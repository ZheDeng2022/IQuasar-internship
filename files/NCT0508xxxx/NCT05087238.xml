  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the present interdisciplinary research program is to develop and evaluate a&#xD;
      disease-specific cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) protocol to increase quality of life (QoL)&#xD;
      and reduce symptom burden in patients with Premature Ventricular Contractions (PVC).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will be recruited in collaboration with arrythmia specialist units in Stockholm and&#xD;
      through advertisement in local newspapers and social media. All patients giving informed&#xD;
      consent will be screened thoroughly by the research nurse and a psychologist before included&#xD;
      by the study cardiologist. 20-30 patients that meet eligibility criteria will be included and&#xD;
      receive 8-10 sessions of cognitive behavior therapy during 8-10 weeks. Due to the current&#xD;
      Covid-19 pandemic, treatment will be delivered face-to face through a secure digital&#xD;
      platform. The psychologist delivering the treatment will have direct access to the study&#xD;
      cardiologist during treatment. Follow-up at 3 and 6 months.&#xD;
