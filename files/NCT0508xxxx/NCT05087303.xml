  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how the use of two different types of&#xD;
      telemedicine (distance medical care) can address barriers to receiving comprehensive sickle&#xD;
      cell care, and whether care can be improved. Aim 1: Adapt two telemedicine models (i.e.,&#xD;
      hub-and-spoke; direct-to-consumer) for use with children with SCD using caregiver input from&#xD;
      our preliminary K12 work. Aim 2: Demonstrate the feasibility of the telemedicine models&#xD;
      developed in Aim 1 as the models undergo successive stakeholder refinement during use in&#xD;
      actual clinical care. Aim 3: Evaluate the effectiveness of the refined models from Aim 2 in a&#xD;
      pre/post study by assessing (a) process of care measures, (b) provider satisfaction, (c)&#xD;
      caregiver/patient-centered outcomes, and (d) clinical outcomes and healthcare utilization.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must be between 0 to 21 years old with Sickle Cell Disease and receive care&#xD;
             at the Riley Hospital for Children Comprehensive Sickle Cell Disease clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The family must be willing to receive their care using the telemedicine model&#xD;
             available to them based on the location of their primary residence.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TeleSCD model participants must live within 1 hour of the pre-identified telemedicine&#xD;
             sites, while VirtualSCD model participants must live within the city limits of the&#xD;
             pre-identified area.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If a patient receives chronic transfusion therapy, they will not be eligible to&#xD;
             participate, as our telemedicine models will not support this.&#xD;
