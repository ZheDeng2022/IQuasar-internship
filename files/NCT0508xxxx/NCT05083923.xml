  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of this study are to determine the safety and tolerability of DRF&#xD;
      administered for up to 24 weeks in adult East Asian participants with RMS (Part 1) and to&#xD;
      determine the safety and tolerability of DRF administered for up to 48 weeks in adult East&#xD;
      Asian participants with RMS (Part 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic(s) (PK) of DRF&#xD;
      metabolites (monomethyl fumarate [MMF] and 2-hydroxyethyl succinimide [HES]) following&#xD;
      multiple doses of DRF in a subset of adult East Asian participants with RMS (Part 1).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical investigation participant administered a pharmaceutical product and that does not necessarily have a causal relationship with this treatment. An AE can therefore be any unfavorable and unintended sign, symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal (investigational) product, whether or not related to the medicinal (investigational) product. An SAE is any untoward medical occurrence that at any dose results in death, in the view of the investigator, places the participant at immediate risk of death (a life-threatening event), requires inpatient hospitalization or prolongation of existing hospitalization, results in persistent or significant disability/incapacity, results in a congenital anomaly/birth defect or is a medically important event.</description>

    <measure>Part 1: Number of Participants with Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) Events</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Week 24</time_frame>
    <description>The C-SSRS is an interview-based rating scale to systematically assess suicidal ideation and suicidal behavior. C-SSRS assesses whether participant experiences any of the following 1. completed suicide, 2. suicide attempt (response of &quot;yes&quot; on &quot;actual attempt&quot;), 3. preparatory acts toward imminent suicidal behavior (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;aborted attempt&quot;, &quot;interrupted attempt&quot;, &quot;preparatory acts or behavior&quot;), 4. any suicidal behavior or ideation, suicidal ideation (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;wish to be dead&quot;, &quot;non-specific active suicidal thoughts&quot;, &quot;active suicidal ideation with methods without intent to act or some intent to act, without specific plan or with specific plan and intent&quot;), 5. self-injurious behavior, no suicidal intent (&quot;yes&quot; on &quot;has participant engaged in non-suicidal self-injurious behavior&quot;).</description>
