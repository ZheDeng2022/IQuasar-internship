  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Hong Kong, approximately half of the kindergarten children have dental caries (tooth&#xD;
      decay) and the majority (&gt;90%) of the decayed teeth were left untreated. There is a need to&#xD;
      generate clinical evidence for designing an effective dental caries prevention programme for&#xD;
      preschool children in Hong Kong. The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness&#xD;
      of 38% silver diamine fluoride (SDF), 5% sodium fluoride (NaF) varnish and placebo control in&#xD;
      preventing dentine cavitated caries in primary molars in preschool children when applied&#xD;
      semi-annually over 30 months. Around 770 preschool children attending Grade 1 in selected&#xD;
      kindergartens will be invited to participate in this clinical trial. Only generally healthy&#xD;
      children with written parental consent will be included. At baseline, clinical examination&#xD;
      will be conducted in the kindergarten to assess the tooth and oral hygiene status of the&#xD;
      included children. After the baseline examination, the children will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      one of the following three study groups and the occlusal (biting) surfaces of their primary&#xD;
      molars will receive the corresponding interventions: Group A - semi-annual topical&#xD;
      application of 38% SDF; Group B - semi-annual application of 5% NaF varnish; and Group C -&#xD;
      semi-annual application of placebo control with tonic water. Clinical examination of the&#xD;
      study teeth in the children will be conducted every 6 months after the baseline to assess the&#xD;
      outcome of the intervention. The primary outcome is whether cavitated dentine caries lesion&#xD;
      is found in the treated occlusal tooth surface. The null hypothesis tested is that there is&#xD;
      no difference in the effectiveness of semi-annual application of 38% SDF and that of 5% NaF&#xD;
      varnish versus placebo control in preventing dentin occlusal caries in primary molars of&#xD;
      preschool children. The results of the proposed study will provide evidence to strengthen or&#xD;
      refute the recommendation regarding the use of SDF for preventing occlusal caries in primary&#xD;
      molars. The study findings will be valuable for guiding decision-making among dental&#xD;
      practitioners and health policymakers on whether SDF should be complemented in a school-based&#xD;
      caries prevention program.&#xD;
