      This study aimed to investigate the effect of oral stimulation and a supplemental nursing&#xD;
      system on the time to full maternal breastfeeding and sucking success in preterm infants. The&#xD;
      sample consisted of 70 preterm babies. Oral motor stimulation and a supplemental nursing&#xD;
      system were applied to the preterm infants in the experimental group, while no intervention&#xD;
      was applied to those in the control group.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Oral motor stimulation (OMS) and The supplemental nursing system (SNS)</intervention_name>
    <description>OMS and an SNS were applied to preterm infants in the experimental group. Oral stimulation intervention provides assisted movement to activate muscle contraction and provides movement against resistance to build strength. The cheeks (internal and external), lips, gums, tongue, and palate were stimulated by finger-stroking following the protocol. OMS consisted of intra (oral region) and peri-oral stimulation (around the oral region). The OMS was administered three times a day by a nurse, from the day of initiation of oral feeding to the day of independent oral feeding 15 minutes before the feeding schedule. A bottle/container was filled with breast milk before the process and given to the baby via SNS while the baby was holding the mother's breast. The SNS consists of a syringe/container and a feeding catheter. One end of the feeding probe is inside the syringe/container, while the other end of it is fixed to the mother's nipple using plaster.</description>
