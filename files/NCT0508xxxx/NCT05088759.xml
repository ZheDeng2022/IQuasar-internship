      A 400-patient U.S.-based single-center Quality Improvement Initiative in the form of a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial focused on the feasibility of implementation of this electronic&#xD;
      alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA) based on LDL-C values. The 400 patients will be comprised of 200&#xD;
      in the &quot;Hospitalized Patient Cohort&quot; and 200 in the &quot;Outpatient Clinic Cohort.&quot; The&#xD;
      allocation ratio will be 1:1 for an electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA) notification versus&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the striking failure to achieve evidence-based and guideline-recommended low-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) targets and widespread underutilization of effective&#xD;
      LDL-lowering therapies, including ezetimibe and PCSK9 inhibitors, even among highest risk&#xD;
      patients, a heavy, unmitigated burden of cardiovascular risk persists, is addressable, and&#xD;
      demands novel strategies. An alert-based computerized decision support (CDS) strategy&#xD;
      addressed successfully a similar unmet need in cardiovascular medicine: the failure to&#xD;
      prescribe antithrombotic therapy in atrial fibrillation patients at high-risk for stroke&#xD;
      (Piazza G, et al. Eur Heart J. 2020 Mar 7;41(10):1086-1096). This alert-based CDS strategy&#xD;
      tripled appropriate antithrombotic prescriptions in this vulnerable patient population. The&#xD;
      alert reduced the odds of myocardial infarction (MI) at 90 days by 87% (OR 0.13; 95% CI&#xD;
      0.04-0.45) and cerebrovascular events or systemic embolism at 90 days by 88% (OR 0.12; 95% CI&#xD;
      0.0-0.91). Alert-based CDS effectively overcame barriers to guideline-directed therapy,&#xD;
      integrating numerous clinical trials and evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, failure&#xD;
      to identify at-risk patients, and educational gaps in strategies for stroke prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The crisis in the failure to achieve guideline-directed LDL-C targets demonstrates similar&#xD;
      clinical obstacles, suggesting that a CDS approach could be effective for optimizing lipid&#xD;
      management. The following single-center, 400-patient, randomized controlled trial of an EPIC&#xD;
      Best Practice Advisory (BPA; alert-based computerized decision support tool) aims to increase&#xD;
      guideline-directed utilization of appropriate LDL-lowering therapies in undertreated&#xD;
      inpatients and outpatients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including&#xD;
      those with recent acute coronary syndrome (ACS). The study will evaluate this CDS&#xD;
      intervention in both patient populations in parallel to gain insight into the impact of&#xD;
      different settings on this approach and to better position implementation of this strategy in&#xD;
      our own health systems and other clinical settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: A 400-patient U.S.-based single-center Quality Improvement Initiative in the&#xD;
      form of a randomized controlled trial focused on the feasibility of implementation of this&#xD;
      electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA) based on LDL-C values. The 400 patients will be&#xD;
      comprised of 200 in the &quot;Hospitalized Patient Cohort&quot; and 200 in the &quot;Outpatient Clinic&#xD;
      Cohort.&quot; The allocation ratio will be 1:1 for an electronic alert-based CDS (EPIC BPA)&#xD;
      notification versus no notification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Patients eligible for enrollment will be drawn from two populations with&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), including those with recent acute coronary&#xD;
      syndrome (ACS): hospitalized patients (inpatients) and clinic patients (outpatients).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inpatient Cohort: All patients ≥ 18 years old and admitted to the BWH Cardiovascular Medicine&#xD;
      Service with a diagnosis (primary or secondary), medical history entry, or problem list entry&#xD;
      of ASCVD (acute coronary syndromes, a history of MI, stable or unstable angina, coronary or&#xD;
      other arterial revascularization, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or peripheral arterial&#xD;
      disease) will be identified by the EPIC BPA. Those with a most recent (within 1 year) or&#xD;
      current LDL-C value greater than 80 mg/dL (allowing for a 10% difference between goal LDL-C&#xD;
      and current measurement) who are on a statin but not on ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitor will&#xD;
      be potentially eligible for randomization. Any patients with no recent LDL-C measurement&#xD;
      within the year prior to randomization will have an alert issued to their providers with&#xD;
      recommendation for checking a lipid panel, which would be standard-of-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outpatient Cohort: All patients ≥ 18 years old and seen in the BWH Watkins Cardiovascular&#xD;
      Medicine Clinic with a diagnosis (primary of secondary) or problem list entry of ASCVD will&#xD;
      be identified by the EPIC BPA. Those with a most recent (within 1 year) or current LDL-C&#xD;
      value greater than 80 mg/dL (allowing for a 10% difference between goal LDL-C and current&#xD;
      measurement) who are on a statin but not on ezetimibe and/or PCSK9 inhibitor will be&#xD;
      potentially eligible for randomization. Any patients with no recent LDL-C measurement within&#xD;
      one year will have an alert issued to their providers with recommendation for checking a&#xD;
      lipid panel, which would be standard-of-care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The study team will devise a program to run within the EPIC Electronic Health&#xD;
      Record (EHR) that will identify patients with ASCVD who are hospitalized on the BWH&#xD;
      Cardiovascular Medicine Service or seen in the BWH Watkins Cardiovascular Medicine Clinic and&#xD;
      have a most recent (within 1 year) or current LDL-C value greater than 80 mg/dL and are on a&#xD;
      statin but not an PCSK9 inhibitor. In these patients who subsequently randomly assigned to&#xD;
      the alert-based CDS strategy, an on-screen electronic alert will prompt the responsible&#xD;
      inpatient provider (inpatient cohort) or the cardiologist of record for the clinic visit&#xD;
      (outpatient cohort) as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. All patients whose LDL-C is not less than 70 mg/dL and not taking a maximally tolerated&#xD;
           statin dose will prompt a recommendation for statin intensification&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. All patients whose LDL-C is within 20% of 70 mg/dL and who are on a maximally tolerated&#xD;
           statin dose but not on ezetimibe or PCSK9 inhibitor will receive a prompt for adding&#xD;
           ezetimibe&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. All patients whose LDL-C is greater than 20% of goal, and on a maximally tolerated&#xD;
           statin (±ezetimibe) but not on PCSK9 inhibitor will receive a prompt for initiating&#xD;
           PCSK9 inhibitor&#xD;
&#xD;
      The alert-based CDS will consist of an on-screen electronic dialogue box that will notify the&#xD;
      clinician that the patient is at increased risk for cardiovascular events and is not at LDL-C&#xD;
      goal according to current evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. The clinician will&#xD;
      have the opportunity to proceed to an order template through which ezetimibe or a PCSK9&#xD;
      inhibitor can be prescribed. The clinician could also elect to learn more about current&#xD;
      evidence-based clinical practice guideline recommendations for LDL targets. Finally, the&#xD;
      clinician could elect to proceed without ordering more intensive lipid-lowering therapy or&#xD;
      reading the guidelines but would have to provide a rationale for not prescribing ezetimibe or&#xD;
      a PCSK9 inhibitor.&#xD;
