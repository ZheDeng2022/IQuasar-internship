             rheumatologic, psychiatric, genitourinary, or metabolic disturbances&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had major illness or surgery (example, requiring general anesthesia) within 12 weeks&#xD;
             before screening, or will not have fully recovered from illness or surgery, or has&#xD;
             surgery planned during the time the participant is expected to participate in the&#xD;
             study or within 21 weeks after the last dose of study intervention administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        Part 2:&#xD;
&#xD;
