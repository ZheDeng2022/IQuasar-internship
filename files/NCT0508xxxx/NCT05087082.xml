    <textblock>
      This project will be part of a larger, 'virtual hospital-at-home' (vHaH) project called&#xD;
      Influenz-er. vHaH is a care model designed to deliver medical care in the home, as a&#xD;
      substitute for a continued inpatient hospital admission. An underlying rationale for the&#xD;
      development of vHaH is that, by avoiding the hospital environment, fragile and older persons&#xD;
      may experience high-quality care that is associated with fewer complications, and higher&#xD;
      treatment satisfaction for patients and their families1. Various versions of home-hospital&#xD;
      models have been implemented during the COVID-19 pandemic crisis, but in many situations out&#xD;
      of need and so far, only very limited documented experience from sound research approaches is&#xD;
      available in the medical literature. This project will be a clinical feasibility study, which&#xD;
      will be used to guide the framing and design of the final telemedicine supported vHaH model&#xD;
      of epidemic patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of Influenz-er, is to develop and implement a novel telemedicine monitoring&#xD;
      and communication model, that will enable safe admission of epidemic patients in their homes.&#xD;
      We will implement this novel model in the safest possible way, and exclusively offer the vHaH&#xD;
      model to patients conventionally admitted with COVID-19 illness for at least 24 hours.&#xD;
      Conversion to vHaH admission will only be effectuated after a medical infectious disease&#xD;
      doctor has assessed the patient ready to continue the hospital admission safely from home,&#xD;
      under continued monitoring and treatment responsibility by the hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on a Cochrane review this innovative alternative to conventional hospitalization, is&#xD;
      expected to benefit patients who will remain in the comfort of their own homes2. This model&#xD;
      could potentially increase patient and next of kin quality of life and treatment&#xD;
      satisfaction, decrease risks of nosocomial complications and increase availability of&#xD;
      emotional support from next of kin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hospital based Virtual Epidemic Center (VEC) will be the center of the project, from where&#xD;
      medical staff will monitor and communicate with patients admitted at home. Vital parameters&#xD;
      and patient reported outcomes will be collected using a smart phone/tablet-based app. All&#xD;
      data will be collected and processed in an algorithm to predict the impact of changes on&#xD;
      disease severity. Algorithm and direct patient data will be displayed in real-time at the&#xD;
      hospital in the VEC, allowing medical staff to continuously monitor their patients. In&#xD;
      addition, daily virtual ward rounds conducted by staff in the VEC and when relevant by&#xD;
      medical doctors (MD) from specialties of relevance to the patients' illness(es) will ensure&#xD;
      close communication and relevant clinical assessments. An outgoing medical team consisting of&#xD;
      nurses and medical doctors (MD), will perform in-person patient evaluations, administer&#xD;
      medication and perform other required daytime routine medical tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Influenz-er project governance structure consists of a Steering Committee with&#xD;
      representation by the project partners Nordsjællands Hospital, University of Southern Denmark&#xD;
      and Innovation Fund Denmark, an international Advisory Board and a national Consulting Group.&#xD;
      Head of Clinical Research at Nordsjællands Hospital, Professor Thea Kølsen Fischer is&#xD;
      principle investigator and project manager. The project team includes clinical experts with&#xD;
      expertise within management of COVID-19 as well as health economic senior experts, PhD&#xD;
      students, administrative research and innovation coordinators and health tech developers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this feasibility study is to investigate and analyze relevant factors for&#xD;
      admitting adult patients with COVID-19 in a vHaH model, including patient-, next of kin-,&#xD;
      clinical- and organizational outcomes, to ascertain the likelihood of completing the vHaH&#xD;
      model successfully.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolment Potential study patients will be identified by the general healthcare staff of the&#xD;
      hospital COVID-19 ward, after a minimum of 24 hours of observation and conventional care, in&#xD;
      order to ensure that the patients are in a stable phase of the disease. The healthcare staff&#xD;
      of the hospital COVID-19 ward will be trained in, and instructed to, recognize potential&#xD;
      eligible patients and subsequently inform the attending study personnel in the VEC. Study&#xD;
      personnel will then assess the patients in the ward. The patients will receive oral and&#xD;
      written information regarding the study and will be asked if they can identify a next of kin&#xD;
      as a primary informal caregiver. Primary informal caregivers can be anyone and does not&#xD;
      necessarily have to live with the patients or be the person who spends most time with the&#xD;
      patients. The patients are not required to identify a primary informal caregiver in order to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Patients with children in their household are not necessarily&#xD;
      excluded, as the guidelines mention how to accommodate kids in the household. Current&#xD;
      guidelines regarding self-isolation of SARS-CoV-2 positive individuals given by the Danish&#xD;
      government will be applicable for patients admitted at home and their primary informal&#xD;
      caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patients do identify a primary informal caregiver this person will be contacted and&#xD;
      the oral and written information regarding the study, will be repeated for the identified&#xD;
      primary informal caregivers. Study consent is obtained electronically via REDCap from&#xD;
      patients and primary informal caregivers (if any) who are still interested in participating&#xD;
      after having received information regarding the study. This is followed by the generation of&#xD;
      an inclusion-ID for each via REDCap. To ensure that identified primary informal caregivers&#xD;
      are taken into consideration, it is a requirement that both patients and primary informal&#xD;
      caregivers agree to participate in the study. The study patients must accept that primary&#xD;
      informal caregivers have the rights to terminate the HaH-admission and demand the conversion&#xD;
      of the HaH-admission to a conventional hospital admission at any time. If potential study&#xD;
      patients do not accept this term it will be considered as an exclusion criterion and the&#xD;
      patients will not be considered eligible for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, the patients will be formally assessed for inclusion, in accordance with&#xD;
      inclusion- and exclusion criteria. Included patients and primary informal caregivers (if any)&#xD;
      will get a formal study-ID each. Study patients will receive and install the study app on a&#xD;
      compatible device and the study personnel will ensure that study patients are educated in the&#xD;
      basic functionality of the app.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who do not meet the inclusion criteria will be either permanently or temporarily&#xD;
      excluded and will retain their inclusion-ID. Age, gender and the reason of exclusion will be&#xD;
      noted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first set of biometric data will be obtained within the hospital, assisted by the staff&#xD;
      in order to secure the proper usage of the equipment. Furthermore, study patients will be&#xD;
      equipped with a direct phone number for the VEC, which they can use to contact the personnel&#xD;
      in the VEC independently from the app. All study patients are instructed to contact 112 in&#xD;
      the case of a medical emergency requiring immediate medical assistance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study patients will be instructed to measure and upload biometrical data (body&#xD;
      temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiratory frequency, oxygen saturation, blood&#xD;
      glucose) at a frequency specified by the attending Medical Doctor (MD) in accordance with&#xD;
      medical assessment, according to standard hospital early warning score (EWS)-screening. The&#xD;
      glucose monitoring frequency will be decided according to the local guidelines. Furthermore,&#xD;
      patients will be instructed to complete and upload the self-assessment questionnaire along&#xD;
      with all biometric uploads using the app. Study patients with controlled comorbidities such&#xD;
      as diabetes will be monitored and treated as per usual according to local applicable&#xD;
      guidelines, and medical specialists will be available for collegial sparring as is the case&#xD;
      during a conventional hospitalization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The app will notify the study patients when it is time to upload a new set of biometrical and&#xD;
      self-assessed data and notify upcoming planned virtual ward rounds. Adjustments to&#xD;
      surveillance level will be communicated directly to study patients by attending personnel in&#xD;
      the VEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After all relevant information has been confidently delivered and the app has been&#xD;
      successfully installed, the study patients will be admitted at home by the VEC MD on duty.&#xD;
      All study patients will be offered a free transfer home. If the study patients are still&#xD;
      dependent on supplemental oxygen this will be installed in their home prior to the home&#xD;
      admission, and the patients and their relatives will receive thorough instructions in how to&#xD;
      use the oxygen equipment as well as how to behave with oxygen equipment at home.&#xD;
