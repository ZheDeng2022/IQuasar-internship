      As efforts to control malaria are stalling, and malaria is particularly severe in children&#xD;
      U2, it is imperative for countries in Africa with areas of moderate-to-high malaria&#xD;
      transmission to implement IPTi through the EPI, with IPTi given with additional EPI contacts&#xD;
      to the currently recommended 3 doses, including those in the second year of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MULTIPLY project goal is to improve child survival by decreasing malaria and anaemia&#xD;
      burden, as well as vaccine-preventable diseases. Inequities in access will be addressed by&#xD;
      delivering the intervention -IPTi-, through the EPI, including mobile-outreach clinics to&#xD;
      facilitate access of hard-to-reach populations facing socio-economic and/or geographic&#xD;
      barriers. All of this will maximise the delivery and uptake of IPTi to achieve the full&#xD;
      potential and effectiveness of the intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The African region continues to bear the largest burden of malaria morbidity with more than&#xD;
      215 million malaria cases (94% of the total) in 2019 [1]. The majority of these cases&#xD;
      occurred in children under 5 years of age (U5), who also bore the highest mortality burden&#xD;
      with 67% of all malaria deaths (over 274,000 children) [1]. It is estimated that about 24&#xD;
      million children, most of them U5, had P. falciparum infection in 2018 in sub-Saharan Africa&#xD;
      (SSA) [2].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest World Malaria Report indicates that, although the incidence of malaria cases in&#xD;
      sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has declined from 2000 to 2019, these gains have stalled in recent&#xD;
      years [1]. Importantly, the age pattern of severe malaria disease and death has not changed;&#xD;
      it is still children under 2 years of the age (U2) that bear the brunt. Even in&#xD;
      low-to-moderate malaria transmission settings, where older children suffer most malaria&#xD;
      episodes, infants have the highest mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decades, little changes have been introduced in the armamentarium to prevent&#xD;
      malaria in children exposed to the infection that mostly rely on the use of&#xD;
      insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). However, despite the wide distribution of ITNs only 52% of&#xD;
      pregnant women and children slept under an ITN in 2019 [1]. In the last decade a renewed&#xD;
      interest and drive in the use of drugs to prevent malaria led the WHO policy recommendation&#xD;
      in 2012 advise seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) in areas of highly seasonal malaria&#xD;
      transmission [3]. Over the last years, SMC has been increasingly deployed not only in the&#xD;
      initially recommended malaria transmission areas, but also in other endemic settings that do&#xD;
      not necessarily meet the agreed criteria for SMC implementation. As the evidence suggests,&#xD;
      the currently used malaria control strategies are insufficient to achieve a significant&#xD;
      reduction in the malaria burden of disease and death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010, the WHO recommended IPTi for malaria control in children living in areas with&#xD;
      moderate-to-high malaria transmission where resistance to sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) is&#xD;
      low, defined as prevalence of a specific (K540E) resistance-causing gene mutations of 50% or&#xD;
      less in the malaria parasite [4]. IPTi consists of the administration of a full therapeutic&#xD;
      course of SP (whether or not parasites are present) through the Expanded Programme on&#xD;
      Immunisation (EPI) at defined intervals corresponding to routine vaccination contacts at 10&#xD;
      weeks of age with diphtheria, tetanus toxoids and pertussis (DTP)2, 14 weeks with DTP3, and 9&#xD;
      months of age with measles immunisation [4].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite that IPTi has been shown to be safe and efficacious in reducing clinical malaria,&#xD;
      anaemia and hospital admissions, and to be highly cost-effective since it is delivered&#xD;
      through the EPI and uses an inexpensive antimalarial drug SP (0.17 USD / tablet), it has not&#xD;
      been implemented to date except in Sierra Leone [5-7]. Reasons for this are unclear although&#xD;
      a generalised overoptimistic perception that malaria was under control in many endemic&#xD;
      countries, together with poorly supported evidence that IPTi would spread parasite resistance&#xD;
      to SP, may be some of the reasons for impeding its implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For too long malaria control has relied on vertical approaches, carried out by a sense of&#xD;
      urgency that we could not wait until health systems would develop in endemic countries and&#xD;
      thus, new parallel delivery systems would need to be created. Integrated Child Care&#xD;
      Management, SMC and ITNs built on that approach. Unlike these activities, IPTi builds on the&#xD;
      concept of using an existing and effective delivery platform, the EPI, integrating health&#xD;
      services, which is essential to sustainability and equity and a fundamental component of&#xD;
      Universal Health Coverage, a flagship of WHO, and will contribute to the Global Technical&#xD;
      Strategy for Malaria 2016-2030, &quot;Pillar 1. Ensure universal access to malaria prevention,&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment&quot; [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Sierra Leone, IPTi was introduced in four districts in 2017, followed by its national&#xD;
      scale-up in 2018. Undoubtedly, the IPTi programme in Sierra Leone represents a unique&#xD;
      opportunity to learn lessons that may apply to other countries where this strategy would be&#xD;
      implemented. According to a recent report from the MOH of Sierra Leone, at 9 months of age&#xD;
      only a third (32.2%) of the infants had received the three recommended IPTi doses, and of the&#xD;
      52.2% of the children who received the measles vaccination at 9 months of age, only 36.4% of&#xD;
      them also received the third dose of IPTi. Thus, even where IPTi is implemented nationwide&#xD;
      there are important challenges that need to be addressed to optimise the coverage and the&#xD;
      impact of this malaria control strategy, and efforts need to be made to strengthen the supply&#xD;
      of, and demand for, EPI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A frequent concern regarding the use of an antimalarial drug especially if given as&#xD;
      monotherapy is the potential development of parasite resistance. The fact that IPTi with SP&#xD;
      is only given to a small proportion of individuals, together with the reduction in malaria&#xD;
      episodes resulting from the intervention, and that SP is no longer the first-line&#xD;
      antimalarial drug in endemic countries, make the likelihood of developing parasite resistance&#xD;
      associated to IPTi to below [9]. Moreover, mathematical models predict that IPTi is unlikely&#xD;
      to shorten the useful life of the drug or to significantly affect the spread of highly&#xD;
      resistant parasites in areas where partial resistance to SP is already established [10, 11].&#xD;
      However, to provide advance warning of increases in drug resistance that may indicate&#xD;
      considering replacing SP to an alternative drug for IPTi, implementation of the intervention&#xD;
      should be accompanied by monitoring of drug-resistance in some sentinel areas of the country&#xD;
      [10]. In Sierra Leone for instance, after one year of national IPTi implementation, there was&#xD;
      no evidence of increasing resistance to SP [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prophylactic effect of IPTi provides protection for up to 6 weeks in infants. Therefore,&#xD;
      in the currently recommended IPTi scheme, infants are exposed to the infection for about 4&#xD;
      months during a critical period of high susceptibility to harmful effects of the infection.&#xD;
      Exploiting additional opportunities to administer IPTi to children in their first years of&#xD;
      life could be of great public health interest. In settings where vitamin A deficiency is a&#xD;
      public health problem WHO recommends vitamin A supplementation, habitually done through the&#xD;
      EPI scheme starting at 6 months of age, at 6 months intervals; thus, the addition of IPTi at&#xD;
      6, 12, 15 and 18 months of age to vitamin A administration would improve malaria prevention&#xD;
      during a critical time in the first year of life and expand it into the second. Moreover, the&#xD;
      integration of these two interventions might help increase the coverage of vitamin A&#xD;
      supplementation, which ranges between 53%-57% in sub-Saharan Africa, and importantly will&#xD;
      help reduce the prevalence of anaemia in young children by combining the effect of malaria&#xD;
      prevention and of vitamin A on increasing haemoglobin levels [13]. Additionally, in recent&#xD;
      years the inclusion of a booster dose of measles immunisation in the EPI, between 15-18&#xD;
      months of age, also offers the opportunity of further expanding malaria protection in the&#xD;
      second year of life using IPTi. This is particularly relevant given that severe malaria cases&#xD;
      are more prevalent between 1 and 3 years of age in high and moderate transmission areas [14,&#xD;
      15]. By integrating IPTi with EPI contacts, and conducting a social and behaviour change&#xD;
      communication (SBCC) campaign to inform the community of the importance of EPI, and the&#xD;
      malaria protection afforded by IPTi delivered at the EPI, the demand for EPI is likely to be&#xD;
      increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential adverse effects on the serological response to immunisation of the concomitant&#xD;
      administration of SP with routine vaccines were assessed previously demonstrating that there&#xD;
      is no negative effect [16]. Additionally, no evidence of adverse interactions between vitamin&#xD;
      A and SP concomitant administration exist.&#xD;
