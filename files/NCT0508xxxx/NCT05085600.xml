  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic neck pain is described as pain located between the occiput and the third thoracic&#xD;
      vertebra that persists for more than 3 months. Chronic neck pain is one of the biggest&#xD;
      musculoskeletal health problem in industrialized countries, representing 14.6% of all such&#xD;
      problems today. 50% of the adult population will experience cervical pain at some point&#xD;
      during the year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to compare the effectiveness of a single exercise session with&#xD;
      manual therapy techniques of the upper cervical spine against a single exercise session in&#xD;
      patients with chronic neck pain and upper cervical spine dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment will be applied by 1 therapist with orthopedic manual therapist (MT)-specialist&#xD;
      training and more than 10 years of MT experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measurements will be cervical mobility and cervical pressure pain&#xD;
      threshold. Intensity of pain will be also used as secondary outcome measure. These&#xD;
      measurements shall be taken before and immediately after the relevant intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Group After the baseline assessments, patients will performed the cervical&#xD;
      stabilization exercise, and will taught to perform the contraction of deep neck flexor muscle&#xD;
      activity with the help of the Stabilizer Pressure Biofeedback Unit (Chattanooga, USA) in&#xD;
      supine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, progress will continued in the exercise of the contraction of deep neck flexor&#xD;
      muscles in other positions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The progression of the exercises will be adapted to each patient, depending on their&#xD;
      evolution. Firstly, exercises will undertaken in the supine and standing positions; once&#xD;
      these positions will be mastered, the exercises progressed to asymmetric positions with&#xD;
      cervical bending and/or rotation toward each patient's most symptomatic side. Also, no pain&#xD;
      will be allowed in the positions. Exercises were always carried out without pain, because&#xD;
      pain can be an inhibitor of muscle contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Exercise (E) group will carried out one 20-minute session, composed of 2 blocks of 10&#xD;
      repetitions, holding each exercise for 10 seconds, a 40-second rest between each repetition&#xD;
      and 2 minutes between blocks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Manual Therapy + Exercise Group The MT + E group will carried out 20-minute sessions led by&#xD;
      an experienced physical therapist. In the first 5 minutes, muscle techniques will be&#xD;
      performed to prepare the tissue of the upper cervical spine before applying joint techniques.&#xD;
      In the next 15 minutes, manipulation (high velocity low amplitude) and / or mobilization&#xD;
      techniques of the upper cervical spine, including the C2-3 segment, will be combined with&#xD;
      cervical exercise. The MT techniques were applied depending on the clinical findings in each&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;

    <description>Mobility in the inferior cervical region will be evaluated in a sitting position with the back vertical and resting on the backrest of the chair with a CROM device (floating compass; Plastimo Airguide, Inc, Buffalo Groove,IL). Flexion, extension, right and left side-bending and right and left rotation will be measured. Three measurements will be made for each movement, and the result will be the mean of the three measurements.</description>

    <measure>Active range of motion mobility in the upper cervical region (º)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline(immediately before intervention) and post intervention (immediately after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Flexion rotation-test will be used to measure the upper rotation, predominantly at C1-2. To perform this test, the subjects position themselves in the supine position and the evaluator passively will take the patients cervical spine to its maximum flexion and then will rotated the head to the right and left side with the occiput resting against the evaluator's abdomen. The movement will stopped at whichever situation occurs first, either the subject presents symptoms, or the evaluator reaches the end of the range of motion and finds a firm end feel. A CROM device will be used too, and three measurements will be performed for each movement, with the result being the mean of the three measurements</description>

    <measure>Pressure Pain Threshold (Kpa)</measure>
    <time_frame>Change between baseline(immediately before intervention) and post intervention (immediately after intervention)</time_frame>
    <description>Cervical pressure pain threshold (PPT) will be measured using a digital algometer (Somedic AB Farsta, Somedic SenseLab AB, Sweden) with a round surface area of 1 cm2, and pressure will be applied at the rate of 1 kg/cm2/s perpendicular to the skin. With the subject supine, PPT will be assessed over 6 points bilaterally with a 10-second rest between each measurement: first metacarpal joint, upper trapezius muscle, elevator of scapula, C5-6 zygapophyseal joint, C2-3 zygapophyseal joint, and suboccipital muscles. Patients will be instructed to press the button of the digital algometer at the precise moment that pressure sensation changed to pain. The mean of 3 trials will be calculated over each point and used for analysis.</description>
