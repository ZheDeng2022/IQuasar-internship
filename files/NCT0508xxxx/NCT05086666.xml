      This study is an open-label, Phase 1b/2 clinical study. In the Phase 1b study, the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of AZD4547 in patients with advanced solid tumors will be evaluated, the PK of&#xD;
      oral AZD4547 in Chinese patients and the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) will be determined,&#xD;
      and the antitumor activity will be preliminarily assessed. In the Phase 2 study, the efficacy&#xD;
      of AZD4547 at the recommended dose in patients with locally advanced or metastatic urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma with FGFR2/3 gene alterations (including mutations and/or fusions) will be&#xD;
      evaluated, and the safety, tolerability, and PK of AZD4547 will be further evaluated.&#xD;
