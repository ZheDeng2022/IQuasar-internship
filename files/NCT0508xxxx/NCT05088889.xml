  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study we aim to test the efficacy of a combined and novel approach including&#xD;
      induction chemotherapy (per standard of care) followed by SBRT and maintenance ipililumab +&#xD;
      nivolumab in the first line setting of stage IV PDAC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytotoxic chemotherapy followed by hypofractionated radiotherapy will sensitize pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer to immunotherapy consisting of combined PD-1 and CTLA4 blockade. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      direct targeting of the pancreatic cancer cells by chemotherapy and hypofractionated&#xD;
      radiotherapy is necessary for initial anti-tumor response. Furthermore, the combination of&#xD;
      immunotherapy as a maintenance strategy will have profound anti-tumor efficacy in this&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications of hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved response rate above historical controls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lengthened progression-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Improved overall-survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that baseline markers of immune activation such as Tumor Infiltrating&#xD;
      Lymphocytes and CD8+ lymphocytes will correlate with response to ipililumab + nivolumab and&#xD;
      that responders will have distinct tumor immune phenotype as determined by&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry and gene expression profiling compared to nonresponders.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single arm, single institution study, which aims to evaluate the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of combination therapy with radiosurgery nivolumab and ipilimumab as a maintenance&#xD;
      regimen following first line induction chemotherapy in patients with metastatic pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chemotherapy will be administrated for a minimum of 4 cycles. Patients who have not&#xD;
      progressed on chemotherapy will receive SBRT to one primary/metastatic tumor, followed by&#xD;
      ipilimumab (1mg/kg every six weeks) + nivolumab (360mg every three weeks). After a further 8&#xD;
      weeks patients will be assessed for response; responders will continue ipilimumab + nivolumab&#xD;
      until disease progression, non-responders will receive very low dose radiation to metastatic&#xD;
      sites (this will only be allowed once) prior to continuing ipilimumab + nivolumab until&#xD;
      disease progression. Immunotherapy will be continued until disease progression or up to 24&#xD;
      months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study rationale Overall rational in Brief Although there is evidence for that the immune&#xD;
      system plays an active role in pancreatic cancer, until now checkpoint inhibitors have yet to&#xD;
      demonstrate efficacy in this population. We hypothesize that combining irradiation along with&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibition in a patient population demonstrating stable disease in a first line&#xD;
      setting will be a novel approach towards the treatment of pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Combining Nivolumab and Ipilimumab The roles of CTLA-4 and PD-1 in inhibiting&#xD;
      antitumor responses are largely distinct. Whereas CTLA-4 is thought to regulate T-cell&#xD;
      proliferation early in the immune response, primarily in lymph nodes, PD-1 suppresses T cells&#xD;
      at a later stage in the immune response, primarily in peripheral tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical data indicate that the combination of PD-1 and CTLA-4 receptor blockade may&#xD;
      improve antitumor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encouraging response rates for the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab have been&#xD;
      demonstrated in several types of cancer such as melanoma, renal cell carcinoma, and non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to toxicity concerns regarding the combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab, several&#xD;
      different doses and schedules were evaluated in a phase 1 study as first-line therapy in&#xD;
      patients with advanced NSCLC (CA209012). This study identified an alternative schedule with&#xD;
      an acceptable tolerability profile (28% grade 3-4 toxicity) and encouraging activity (31%&#xD;
      overall response rate) - nivolumab 360 mg/kg every 3 weeks plus ipilimumab 1 mg/kg every 6&#xD;
      weeks, and has therefore been adopted in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for Combining Radiosurgery with anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 High-dose radiation (such&#xD;
      as used in stereotactic radiation body therapy - SBRT) induces DNA damage and cell death.&#xD;
      Radiation alone appears to induce a systemic immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biologic rationale behind the strategy is that radiation will cause release of&#xD;
      immunogenic tumor-antigens from dying tumor cells, which will be processed by cells of the&#xD;
      adaptive immune system, eventually promoting tumor-specific targeting of the tumor by the&#xD;
      immune system. Success of this strategy will hopefully induce and augment the rarely seen&#xD;
      abscopal effect. One possible explanation is that radiation alone rarely induces a rich&#xD;
      immune infiltrate into the dying tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation dose and fractionation schedules for optimal synergy between radiotherapy and&#xD;
      immunotherapy are not well defined. Three fractions of 8 Gy has been successfully combined&#xD;
      with anti-CTLA-4 therapy in mice, and has emerged as a popular regimen for radiation -&#xD;
      immunotherapy trials, and has therefore been adopted in this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population Estimated accrual - 10 patients. The patients for the study will be&#xD;
      identified from the pancreatic cancer clinics at Sheba Medical Center with advanced&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer (stage IV) in the first-line setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 17 patients will be initially evaluated in the first line setting. We estimate&#xD;
      that approximately 50-60% will not progress at three months and they will continue to receive&#xD;
      the study treatment. Only the non-progressors who receive SBRT and combination immunotherapy&#xD;
      will be evaluated in the ITT population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT PLAN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic radiosurgery Simulation will be performed in accordance with the target lesion&#xD;
      location, with 3D or 4D CT as appropriate. Three fractions of 8 Gy, treated on alternate days&#xD;
      (in exceptional circumstances, may treat on consecutive days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab and Ipilimumab Nivolumab administered IV over 30 minutes at a dose of 360mg every 3&#xD;
      weeks. Ipilimumab administered IV over 30 minutes at 1 mg/kg every 6 weeks following the&#xD;
      administration of nivolumab. On the day of infusion, nivolumab is to be administered first.&#xD;
      Ipilimumab will start at least 30 minutes after completion of the nivolumab infusion.&#xD;
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab will be continued until the progression of disease, discontinuation&#xD;
      due to toxicity, withdrawal of consent, or study closure. In any event medication will not be&#xD;
      continued beyond 24 months. Subjects may discontinue only ipilimumab and continue treatment&#xD;
      with nivolumab if certain circumstances are met. Treatment beyond initial investigator&#xD;
      assessed RECIST v1.1 defined progression 2 is permitted if the subject has investigator&#xD;
      assessed clinical benefit and is tolerating nivolumab and ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Low dose irradiation at first progression At time of 1st progression, at physician's&#xD;
      discretion, a single fraction of low dose irradiation (2Gy) will be given to the metastatic&#xD;
      lesions. These patients will continue with immunotherapy - Nivolumab and Ipilimumab in&#xD;
      accordance with treatment protocol. Approximately one week prior to irradiation a simulation&#xD;
      scan will be required. The extent of the low radiation field will depend on the number and&#xD;
      location of the metastases, as well as the feasibility and safety of the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the absence of treatment delays due to adverse event(s), treatment may continue until one&#xD;
      of the following criteria applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Second disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intercurrent illness that prevents further administration of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable adverse event(s)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient decides to withdraw from the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient non-compliance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Termination of the study by sponsor&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The drug manufacturer can no longer provide the study agent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In any event medication will not be continued beyond 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-Up After removal from study treatment patients will return to the clinic&#xD;
      for a short-term FU visit 28 days after the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First long term FU should be performed 100days after the last dose of study drug, and every&#xD;
      90 days thereafter, until death, termination of the study or withdrawal of consent, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. In addition, patients in survival follow-up will be contacted following the&#xD;
      data cut-off for the primary analysis and all subsequent survival analyses to provide&#xD;
      complete survival data. These contacts should generally occur within 7 days of the data cut&#xD;
      off.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients who start the study treatments should be followed up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  information may be obtained via telephone contact, patient's notes, or public records.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If the site becomes aware that a patient has died prior to the final analysis, data&#xD;
           should be completed at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients who discontinue treatment prior to progression should continue to have RECIST&#xD;
           assessments (every 8 weeks from starting study treatment), until confirmed objective&#xD;
           disease progression, as defined by RECIST 1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose Delay Criteria: Tumor assessments for all subjects should continue as per protocol even&#xD;
      if dosing is delayed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab and ipilimumab administration should be delayed for the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade ≥ 2 non-skin, drug-related adverse event, except for fatigue and laboratory&#xD;
           abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade ≥ 3 skin drug-related AE&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade ≥ 3 drug-related laboratory abnormality with the following exceptions for&#xD;
           lymphopenia, AST, ALT, or total bilirubin or asymptomatic amylase or lipase:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 lymphopenia does not require a dose delay&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If a subject has a baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin that is within normal&#xD;
                limits, delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 2 toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If a subject has baseline AST, ALT, or total bilirubin within the Grade 1 toxicity&#xD;
                range, delay dosing for drug-related Grade ≥ 3 toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any Grade ≥ 3 drug-related amylase or lipase abnormality that is not associated&#xD;
                with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis does not require dose&#xD;
                delay. The Principal Investigator should be consulted for such Grade ≥ 3 amylase or&#xD;
                lipase abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any AE, laboratory abnormality or inter-current illness which, in the judgment of the&#xD;
           investigator, warrants delaying the dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects receiving ipilimumab in combination with nivolumab that have drug-related toxicities&#xD;
      that meet the criteria for dose delay, should have both drugs (ipilimumab and nivolumab)&#xD;
      delayed until retreatment criteria are met. Exceptions apply to the retreatment criteria&#xD;
      after dose delay of ipilimumab and nivolumab for Grade ≥ 3 amylase and lipase abnormalities&#xD;
      that are not associated with symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and that are&#xD;
      attributed to ipilimumab alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rescheduling&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab may be delayed until the next planned ipilimumab dose if the next ipilimumab&#xD;
           dose is scheduled within the next 12 days. This will permit periodic ipilimumab dosing&#xD;
           to be synchronized with nivolumab dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab should be dosed at the specified interval regardless of any delays in&#xD;
           intervening nivolumab doses. However, in order to maintain periodic synchronized dosing&#xD;
           of ipilimumab and nivolumab, the dosing days of nivolumab and ipilimumab may be adjusted&#xD;
           within the permitted +/- 5 day window, as long as consecutive nivolumab doses are given&#xD;
           at least 12 days apart. Ipilimumab may be delayed beyond the 5 day window if needed to&#xD;
           synchronize with the next nivolumab dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If an ipilimumab dose is delayed beyond 6 weeks from the prior ipilimumab dose, then&#xD;
           subsequent ipilimumab doses should rescheduled to maintain the 6 week interval between&#xD;
           consecutive ipilimumab doses. Ipilimumab may not be resumed sooner than 6 weeks (+/-&#xD;
           5days) after the prior ipilimumab dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A dose delay of ipilimumab which results in no ipilimumab dosing for &gt; 12 weeks requires&#xD;
           ipilimumab discontinuation, with exceptions as noted in study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose delay of nivolumab which results in treatment interruption of &gt; 6 weeks requires&#xD;
           treatment discontinuation, with exceptions as noted&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose reductions There will be no dose reductions for nivolumab or ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria to Resume Dosing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may resume treatment with nivolumab and/or ipilimumab when the drug-related AE(s)&#xD;
      resolve(s) to Grade ≤ 1 or baseline, with the following exceptions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects may resume treatment in the presence of Grade 2 fatigue.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who have not experienced a Grade 3 drug-related skin AE may resume treatment in&#xD;
           the presence of Grade 2 skin toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with baseline Grade 1 AST/ALT or total bilirubin who require dose delays for&#xD;
           reasons other than a 2-grade shift in AST/ALT or total bilirubin may resume treatment in&#xD;
           the presence of Grade 2 AST/ALT OR total bilirubin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects with combined Grade 2 AST/ALT and total bilirubin values meeting&#xD;
           discontinuation parameters should have treatment permanently discontinued.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug-related pulmonary toxicity, diarrhea, or colitis must have resolved to baseline&#xD;
           before treatment is resumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For Nivolumab: Subjects with persistent Grade 1 pneumonitis after completion of a&#xD;
           steroid taper over at least 1 month may be eligible for retreatment if discussed with&#xD;
           and approved by the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subjects who received systemic corticosteroids for management of any drug-related&#xD;
           toxicity must be off corticosteroids or have tapered down to an equivalent dose of&#xD;
           prednisone ≤ 10 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic hormone&#xD;
           replacement may resume treatment after consultation with the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In general, subjects who meet criteria to resume ipilimumab will also have met criteria&#xD;
           to resume nivolumab, so it should be feasible to synchronize dosing of both drugs when&#xD;
           resuming ipilimumab. In order to facilitate this, the dosing days of nivolumab and&#xD;
           ipilimumab may be adjusted within the permitted +/- 5 day window, as long as consecutive&#xD;
           nivolumab doses are given at least 12 days apart.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  One exception to note is when ipilimumab and nivolumab doses are delayed due to drug&#xD;
           related Grade ≥ 3 amylase or lipase abnormalities not associated with symptoms or&#xD;
           clinical manifestations of pancreatitis. If the investigator assesses the amylase or&#xD;
           lipase abnormality to be related to ipilimumab and not related to nivolumab, nivolumab&#xD;
           may be resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade &lt; 3 but&#xD;
           ipilimumab may only be resumed when the amylase or lipase abnormality resolves to Grade&#xD;
           1 or baseline. Investigator attribution of this toxicity to the ipilimumab dosing must&#xD;
           be clearly noted in the subject's medical chart. The Principal Investigator should be&#xD;
           consulted prior to resuming nivolumab in such subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nivolumab Treatment Discontinuation Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond to&#xD;
           topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within the re-treatment period&#xD;
           OR requires systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade ≥ 2 drug-related pneumonitis or interstitial lung disease that does not&#xD;
           resolve to dose delay and systemic steroids (also see Pulmonary Adverse Event Management&#xD;
           Algorithm).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 3 drug-related bronchospasm, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction,&#xD;
           regardless of duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 3 non-skin, drug-related adverse event lasting &gt; 7 days, with the following&#xD;
           exceptions for uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis, neurologic&#xD;
           toxicity, hypersensitivity reactions, infusion reactions, endocrinopathies, and&#xD;
           laboratory abnormalities:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 drug-related uveitis, pneumonitis, bronchospasm, diarrhea, colitis,&#xD;
                neurologic toxicity, hypersensitivity reaction, or infusion reaction of any&#xD;
                duration requires discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 drug-related endocrinopathies adequately controlled with only physiologic&#xD;
                hormone replacement do not require discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 drug-related laboratory abnormalities do not require treatment&#xD;
                discontinuation except:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3 drug-related thrombocytopenia &gt; 7 days or associated with bleeding requires&#xD;
                discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Any drug-related liver function test (LFT) abnormality that meets the following&#xD;
                criteria require discontinuation (also see Hepatic Adverse Event Management&#xD;
                Algorithm):&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  AST or ALT &gt; 5-10 x ULN for &gt; 2 weeks&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Any Grade 4 drug-related adverse event or laboratory abnormality, except for the&#xD;
           following events, which do not require discontinuation:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 4 neutropenia ≤ 7 days&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 4 lymphopenia or leukopenia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Isolated Grade 4 amylase or lipase abnormalities that are not associated with&#xD;
                symptoms or clinical manifestations of pancreatitis and decrease to &lt; Grade 4&#xD;
                within 1 week of onset. The Principal Investigator should be consulted for Grade 4&#xD;
                amylase or lipase abnormalities&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Isolated Grade 4 electrolyte imbalances/abnormalities that are not associated with&#xD;
                clinical sequelae and are corrected with supplementation/appropriate management&#xD;
                within 72 hours of their onset&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 4 drug-related endocrinopathy adverse events such as adrenal insufficiency,&#xD;
                ACTH deficiency, hyper- or hypothyroidism, or glucose intolerance, which resolve or&#xD;
                are adequately controlled with physiologic hormone replacement (corticosteroids,&#xD;
                thyroid hormones) or glucose controlling agents, respectively, may not require&#xD;
                discontinuation after discussion with and approval from the Principal Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Dosing delays lasting &gt; 6 weeks that occur for non-drug-related reasons may be&#xD;
                allowed if approved by the Principal Investigator. Periodic study visits to assess&#xD;
                safety and laboratory studies should also continue every 6 weeks or more frequently&#xD;
                if clinically indicated during such dosing delays.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any adverse event, laboratory abnormality, or intercurrent illness which, in the&#xD;
           judgment of the Investigator, presents a substantial clinical risk to the subject with&#xD;
           continued ivolumab dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If discontinuation criteria are met for ipilimumab but not for nivolumab, treatment with&#xD;
      nivolumab may continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab Treatment Discontinuation Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any Grade ≥ 2 drug-related uveitis or eye pain or blurred vision that does not respond&#xD;
           to topical therapy and does not improve to Grade 1 severity within 2 weeks OR requires&#xD;
           systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
      Treatment Beyond Disease Progression 2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be permitted to continue on nivolumab and ipilimumab for treatment beyond&#xD;
      initial RECIST v1.1 defined PD as long as they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Investigator-assessed clinical benefit and no rapid disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Subject is tolerating study treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stable performance status&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment beyond progression will not delay an imminent intervention to prevent serious&#xD;
           complications of disease progression (e.g., CNS metastases) A follow-up scan should be&#xD;
           performed within 4 weeks ±5 days of original PD to determine whether there has been a&#xD;
           continued progression of disease. Subsequent scans should be performed every 8 weeks&#xD;
           until further progression is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment should be discontinued permanently upon further progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EVENTS: LIST AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AEs will be graded and recorded throughout&#xD;
      the trial and during the follow-up period according to NCI CTCAE Version 5.0. Toxicities will&#xD;
      be characterized in terms regarding seriousness, causality, toxicity grading, and action&#xD;
      taken with regard to trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying the adverse event:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any inflammatory event, especially those that may respond to steroids, should be considered a&#xD;
      possible adverse event. Most such events cannot be identified on physical examination. It&#xD;
      should be appreciated that patients may not report these symptoms, or may present to other&#xD;
      specialists, who may give inappropriate treatment, e.g potent anti-diarrheal to control a&#xD;
      resistant diarrhea. Furthermore, physicians should be aware that some side effects may appear&#xD;
      many weeks after treatment initiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early diagnosis and treatment intervention for inflammatory events can help prevent the&#xD;
      occurrence of complications, such as GI perforation. Toxicities related to GI (diarrhea and&#xD;
      colitis) and skin (rash and pruritus) are the most common inflammatory events reported in&#xD;
      studies with ipilimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of both Nivolumab+ipilimumab results in a safety profile with similar types&#xD;
      of AEs as either agent alone, but in some cases, with a greater frequency. In general, dose&#xD;
      delays and observation are adequate for low-grade AEs. For moderate- and high-grade AEs,&#xD;
      immunosuppression with corticosteroids should be utilized. Once the AE has begun to improve,&#xD;
      corticosteroids can be tapered over approximately 3 weeks to 6 weeks (depending on the&#xD;
      severity of the AE). The management of AEs considered related to any combination treatment is&#xD;
      similar to the management of AEs caused by either agent alone and utilizes the same safety&#xD;
      management algorithms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients should be assessed for signs and symptoms of enterocolitis, dermatitis, neuropathy,&#xD;
      and endocrinopathy; and clinical chemistries (including liver function and thyroid function&#xD;
      tests) should be evaluated at baseline and at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of management of adverse event Aside from very mild side effects, the first step&#xD;
      should be to hold all study immunotherapies. Early intervention with steroids is to be&#xD;
      considered in the majority of cases, followed possibly by re-starting the study therapeutic&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During evaluation of a suspected immune-mediated AE, all efforts should be made to rule out&#xD;
      neoplastic, infectious, metabolic, toxic, or other etiologic causes. Serological,&#xD;
      immunological, imaging, and occasionally biopsy with histology (e.g., biopsy-proven&#xD;
      lymphocytic) data may be used to support the diagnosis of an immune-mediated toxicity or&#xD;
      support an alternative cause of the AE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, for severe immune-mediated AEs, nivolumab and/or ipilimumab should be permanently&#xD;
      discontinued, and systematic high-dose corticosteroid therapy should be initiated. For&#xD;
      moderate immune-mediated AEs, ipilimumab should be held or delayed, and moderate-dose&#xD;
      corticosteroids should be considered. Upon improvement, corticosteroids should be tapered&#xD;
      gradually over at least 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The causal relationship to study drug is determined by a physician and should be used to&#xD;
      assess all adverse events (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of Serious Adverse Event Serious events include, but are not limited to, intensive&#xD;
      treatment in an emergency room or at home for allergic bronchospasm; blood dyscrasias or&#xD;
      convulsions that do not result in hospitalization.) Potential drug induced liver injury&#xD;
      (DILI) is also considered an important medical event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Suspected transmission of an infectious agent via the study drug is an SAE. Although&#xD;
      pregnancy, overdose, cancer, and potential drug induced liver injury (DILI) are not always&#xD;
      serious by regulatory definition, these events must be handled as SAEs. Any component of a&#xD;
      study endpoint that is considered related to study therapy should be reported as SAE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE: The following hospitalizations are not considered SAEs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a visit to the emergency room or other hospital department &lt; 24 hours&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  elective surgery, planned prior to signing consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  routine health assessment requiring admission for baseline/trending of health status&#xD;
           (eg, routine colonoscopy).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical/surgical admission other than to remedy ill health and planned prior to entry&#xD;
           into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission encountered for another life circumstance that carries no bearing on health&#xD;
           status and requires no medical/surgical intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission for administration of anticancer therapy in the absence of any other SAEs&#xD;
           (applies to oncology protocols)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting All SAEs must be collected that occur during&#xD;
      the screening period and within 100 days of the last dose of study drug. Subjects, who are&#xD;
      randomized and never treated with study drug, must have SAEs collected for 30 days from the&#xD;
      date of randomization. If applicable, SAEs that relate to any later protocol-specified&#xD;
      procedure (eg, a follow-up skin biopsy) must be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator should report any SAE that occurs after these time periods and that is&#xD;
      believed to be related to study drug or protocol-specified procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An SAE report should be completed for any event where doubt exists regarding its seriousness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the investigator believes that an SAE is potentially related to the conditions of the&#xD;
      study (such as withdrawal of previous therapy or a complication of a study procedure), the&#xD;
      relationship should be specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAEs, whether related or not related to study drug, and pregnancies must be reported to BMS&#xD;
      (or designee) within 24 hours of awareness of event. SAEs must be recorded on the SAE Report&#xD;
      Form; pregnancies on a Pregnancy Surveillance Form. Paper forms are to be transmitted via&#xD;
      email or confirmed facsimile (fax). In addition, the local IRB will be informed per local&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If only limited information is initially available, follow-up reports are required. (Note:&#xD;
      Follow-up SAE reports should include the same investigator term(s) initially reported.) If an&#xD;
      ongoing SAE changes in its intensity or relationship to study drug or if new information&#xD;
      becomes available, a follow-up SAE report should be sent within 24 hours to BMS (or designee)&#xD;
      using the same procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All SAEs should be followed to resolution or stabilization. The Investigator will request&#xD;
      from BMS the SAE reconciliation report and include the BMS protocol number every 3 months and&#xD;
      prior to data base lock or final data summary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonserious Adverse Event Collection and Reporting The collection of non-serious AE&#xD;
      information should begin following the subject's written consent to participate in the study&#xD;
      And should be followed to resolution or stabilization of the adverse event to grade 1, or&#xD;
      reported as SAEs if they become serious. Follow-up is also required for nonserious AEs that&#xD;
      cause interruption or discontinuation of study drug and for those present at the end of study&#xD;
      treatment as appropriate. All AEs must be recorded on the CRF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All nonserious adverse events are to be collected continuously during the treatment period&#xD;
      and for a minimum of 28 days following the last dose of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnancy Investigator must immediately notify BMS of Pregnancy event and complete and&#xD;
      forward a Pregnancy Surveillance Form within 24 hours of awareness of the event and in&#xD;
      accordance with SAE reporting procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the rare event that the benefit of continuing study drug is thought to outweigh the risk,&#xD;
      the pregnant subject may continue study drug after a thorough discussion, if allowed by local&#xD;
      regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protocol-required procedures for study discontinuation and follow-up must be performed on the&#xD;
      subject unless contraindicated by pregnancy (eg, x-ray studies). Other appropriate pregnancy&#xD;
      follow-up procedures should be considered if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up information regarding the course of the pregnancy, including perinatal and neonatal&#xD;
      outcome and, where applicable, offspring information must be reported on the Pregnancy&#xD;
      Surveillance Form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Men receiving nivolumab and who are sexually active with women of childbearing potential will&#xD;
      be instructed to adhere to contraception for a period of 7 months after the last dose of&#xD;
      nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to collect any pregnancy surveillance information from the female partner, the&#xD;
      female partner must sign an informed consent form for disclosure of this information.&#xD;
      Information on this pregnancy will be collected on the Pregnancy Surveillance Form and&#xD;
      reported to BMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overdose An overdose is defined as the accidental or intentional administration of any dose&#xD;
      of a product that is considered both excessive and medically important. All occurrences of&#xD;
      overdose must be reported as SAEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential Drug Induced Liver Injury (DILI) All occurrences of potential DILIs, meeting the&#xD;
      defined criteria, must be reported as SAEs .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential DILI is defined as: ALT or AST elevation &gt; 3 times upper limit of normal (ULN) AND&#xD;
      Total bilirubin &gt; 2 times ULN, without initial findings of cholestasis (elevated serum&#xD;
      alkaline phosphatase), AND No other immediately causes of AT elevation and&#xD;
      hyperbilirubinemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hepatic AE management algorithm has been established (and is indicated in the protocol).&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE STUDIES During IO therapy Blood, Stool and Saliva samples for correlative study&#xD;
      will be taken cycle 1 Day 1 of and every 8 weeks thereafter. Biopsies of the disease lesion&#xD;
      will be obtained prior to start of treatment and at 8 weeks. Specific permission will&#xD;
      therefore be included in the consent form. Local regulations for tissue banking and storage&#xD;
      will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fresh biopsy specimens from disease lesion during screening (preferably, at site of SBRT) and&#xD;
      at 8 weeks imaging assessment are mandatory. Optional tissue biopsy will be requested at&#xD;
      progression. (For patients that have stopped treatment for other reasons than PD, tissue&#xD;
      biopsy will be requested at the time of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, Tissue samples will be submitted from existing archived biopsy (diagnostic&#xD;
      specimen), if available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study populations will include safety and efficacy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Safety Population will include all subjects who receive at least 1 dose of ipilimumab,&#xD;
           nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy population will include all subjects in the Safety Population with at least 1&#xD;
           recorded post-baseline disease assessment Statistical methods will be primarily&#xD;
           descriptive in nature. Categorical variables will be summarized using numbers and&#xD;
           percentages. Continuous variables will be summarized by total number (n), mean, standard&#xD;
           deviation, median, and range (minimum and maximum).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Event rates will be summarized, and Kaplan-Meier estimates for PFS and OS may also be&#xD;
      provided where sample size is adequate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety data, including vital signs, laboratory test results, physical examinations, and&#xD;
      adverse events (AEs), will be summarized by dose and assessment time points, as appropriate.&#xD;
      Change from baseline will be included in summary tables for laboratory, and vital sign&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;

             they are stable (without evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks&#xD;
             prior to the first dose of trial treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned&#xD;
             to baseline), have no evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using&#xD;
             steroids for at least 7 days prior to trial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has an active autoimmune disease requiring systemic treatment within the past 3 months&#xD;
             or a documented history of clinically severe autoimmune disease, or a syndrome that&#xD;
             requires systemic steroids or immunosuppressive agents. Subjects with type I diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, skin disorders (such as vitiligo, psoriasis, or alopecia) not requiring&#xD;
             systemic treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external&#xD;
             trigger are permitted to enroll. Subjects that require intermittent use of&#xD;
             bronchodilators or local steroids, e.g., inhaled or topical steroids, at a dose of&#xD;
             less than the equivalent of 10mg prednisone daily, would not be excluded from the&#xD;
             study. Subjects with hypothyroidism stable on hormone replacement or Sjorgen's&#xD;
             syndrome will not be excluded from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has evidence of interstitial lung disease or active, non-infectious pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or is receiving systemic steroid therapy or any&#xD;
             other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of trial&#xD;
             treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has a known history of Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) (HIV 1/2 antibodies).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known active Hepatitis B (e.g., HBsAg reactive) or Hepatitis C (e.g., HCV RNA&#xD;
             [qualitative] is detected).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has known psychiatric or substance abuse disorders that would interfere with&#xD;
             cooperation with the requirements of the trial (chronic pain management medications&#xD;
             should not exclude study participation).&#xD;
