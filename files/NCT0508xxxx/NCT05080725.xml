  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn more about how exercise and protein supply affect&#xD;
      swallow muscles. Twenty healthy older adults will be recruited from local community centers,&#xD;
      physician offices, and retirement communities via flyers. Participants will complete 16&#xD;
      sessions of standard of care swallowing exercises 2 times per week for 8 weeks. All sessions&#xD;
      will be conducted via Zoom. During each session, a series of swallow exercises will be&#xD;
      performed following a demonstration from a trained speech-language pathologist. Participants&#xD;
      will be referred to NYU Langone Health or White Plains Hospital, for a videofluoroscopic&#xD;
      swallowing study, acoustic pharyngometry and measures of hand grip strength before and after&#xD;
      the treatment protocol. Patients will be able to select their preferred site for swallow&#xD;
      study completion. Results will inform the relationship between swallow exercises and&#xD;
      pharyngeal muscles. All devices and exercises are established as safe and effective and are&#xD;
      FDA approved.&#xD;

      The natural next step in this program of research is to investigate interventions for&#xD;
      reversing pharyngeal sarcopenia with the ultimate goal of developing novel therapeutic&#xD;
      strategies to address this pervasive clinical issue. The exercise science literature suggests&#xD;
      that sarcopenia in the limb muscles can be reversed through a combination of rigorous&#xD;
      exercise and adequate levels of dietary protein. The innovative multi-disciplinary protocol,&#xD;
      PEPP (Pharyngeal Exercises Plus Protein), combines pharyngeal swallowing exercises selected&#xD;
      for their known activation of the pharyngeal muscles with daily supplemental protein drinks.&#xD;
      The research lab had documented successful improvements to swallowing physiology and&#xD;
      pharyngeal sarcopenia in a pilot series of 5 older women using PEPP. However the research was&#xD;
      abruptly halted due to both ethical and feasibility challenges posed by the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic. In response to these challenges, this study is seeking to establish the feasibility&#xD;
      and effectiveness when the PEPP intervention is delivered using telehealth (telePEPP).&#xD;

    <description>TelePEPP sessions will be conducted twice per week by a Speech Language Pathologist and/or graduate student clinician, on the study team. This clinician will deliver the intervention from the NYU Voice Center using the web conferencing software Webex (institutional license) on a Dell desktop computer with a 3.1 GHz intel core processor and high definition camera. Each exercise set will include 40 repetitions (10 reps of effortful swallows, tongue hold swallows, effortful pitch glides and maximal posterior tongue presses). All exercises are widely-adopted by clinicians as standard of care exercises. The number of sets will be gradually increased as tolerance builds [2 sets in week 1, 3 sets in week 2, 4 sets in weeks 3+].</description>
