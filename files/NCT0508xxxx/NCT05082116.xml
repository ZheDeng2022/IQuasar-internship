  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study investigates how well the medicine called turoctocog alfa pegol (N8-GP) works in&#xD;
      previously treated Chinese patients with severe haemophilia A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be treated with N8-GP. This is a medicine that doctors can already&#xD;
      prescribe in other countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The medicine will be injected into a vein (intravenous injections) and blood samples will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will last for about 7-8 months. Participants will have between 8 and 15 visits to&#xD;
      the clinic and possibly a number of phone calls with the study doctor.&#xD;
