    <textblock>
      This is an open label, single centre pharmacological and safety study to define the safety&#xD;
      and pharmacokinetics of ModraDoc006/r in a weekly dosing schedule in patients with impaired&#xD;
      liver function who might have benefit from a weekly docetaxel regime. The safety of&#xD;
      ModraDoc006 in combination with ritonavir for the patients with mild and moderate impaired&#xD;
      liver function will be evaluated with a dose escalation design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Oral administration of (anticancer) drugs has many advantages above intravenously&#xD;
      administered compounds for patients. A major obstacle for development of an oral docetaxel&#xD;
      formulation is the observed poor bioavailability of the drug after oral administration. This&#xD;
      was efficiently improved in several pre-clinical and early clinical studies by&#xD;
      co-administration of the CYP3A4 inhibitor ritonavir and by development of a new oral&#xD;
      formulation of docetaxel (ModraDoc006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, treatment with ModraDoc006/r (i.e. oral docetaxel as tablets of 10 mg combined&#xD;
      with a ritonavir dose of 100 mg) has been evaluated in several clinical trials at the NKI. In&#xD;
      these trials, patients have been treated with ModraDoc006/r for a duration of up to 72 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Commonly observed toxicities of ModraDoc006/r in the phase I trials were nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      diarrhea and fatigue, mostly being of CTC (Common Toxicity Criteria) grade 1-2 severity and&#xD;
      usually not interfering with the therapy. Frequently occurring toxicities of intravenously&#xD;
      administered docetaxel, such as neutropenia, hypersensitivity reactions and peripheral&#xD;
      polyneuropathy have rarely been observed with ModraDoc006/r.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The established recommended dose for further treatment with ModraDoc006/r is 30mg ModraDoc006&#xD;
      (combined with 100mg ritonavir) in the morning and 20 mg ModraDoc006 (combined with 100 mg&#xD;
      ritonavir) in the afternoon, as a bidaily weekly schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired hepatic function The primary goal of this study is to explore the safety and&#xD;
      pharmacokinetics of ModraDoc006/r in patients with mild or moderate liver impairment in order&#xD;
      to be able to give appropriate and practical dose recommendations in daily clinical practice.&#xD;
      According to the recommendations of the EMA and FDA guidelines, the Child-Pugh classification&#xD;
      will be used in this study to define different classes of severity of liver impairment.&#xD;
      However, patients with Child-Pugh class C score will not be included in the study, because of&#xD;
      the expected poor performance status and survival and expected increased toxicity related to&#xD;
      severely impaired organ function, for whom the use of ModraDoc006/r is considered&#xD;
      contra-indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will receive oral docetaxel (as ModraDoc006 10 mg tablets) and ritonavir (100 mg&#xD;
      tablet) once- or bi-daily, once a week in a fasted condition. After the end of the study&#xD;
      period of twelve weeks patients will go off study and will immediately be offered the&#xD;
      opportunity to embark on the roll over protocol N17DEX. This will ensure fully that the&#xD;
      patient will receive ModraDoc006/r in the best interest without limitations.&#xD;
