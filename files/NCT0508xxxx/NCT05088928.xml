      The purpose of the study is to describe the safety and efficacy outcomes of a cohort of ICU&#xD;
      patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease treated with therapeutic dose Apixaban for&#xD;
      COVID-19 at a tertiary public health care setting.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an increased risk of Venous and Arterial thromboembolism in COVID-19 infection. The&#xD;
      main reason being that the novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 induces hyperinflammation and&#xD;
      subsequently immunothrombolism which is wide spread in the body. The angiotensin converting&#xD;
      enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is utilized by the virus to infect the host, is present&#xD;
      throughout the human body organs and endothelial cells. Thrombotic microangiopathies are the&#xD;
      consequence of this direct endothelial invasion of the virus and widespread endothelial&#xD;
      inflammation. Consequently, pervasive dysfunction of the endothelium and apoptosis is seen&#xD;
      primarily due to the host immune response and release of pro inflammatory cytokines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A hypercoagulable state is therefore seen due to the shift in the vascular equilibrium&#xD;
      towards a vasoconstrictive and inflammatory response, promoting a microvascular derangement&#xD;
      and dysfunctions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although this pathological response is not unique to the COVID-19 disease, the systemic&#xD;
      coagulopathies observed due to this novel virus are noted to be slightly distinct. These&#xD;
      include the increased risk of mortality with the increased level of D-Dimers in nearly 50% of&#xD;
      the patients . While mild prolongation of Prothrombin time and thrombocytopenia are not noted&#xD;
      to be important predictors of the severity of the disease or its adverse outcomes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      In COVID-19 patients, the International Society on Thrombosis and Hemostasis (ISTH). criteria&#xD;
      for Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) is seldom met, despite the indication by the&#xD;
      typical triad of thrombin time prolonged, decreased platelet counts and increased D-dimer&#xD;
      levels .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation is low grade, the fibrinolytic system is&#xD;
      activated and endogenous tissue plasminogen is released because of the pathogenic&#xD;
      inflammation-causing endothelial cell injury and thrombotic angiopathies of the microvascular&#xD;
      system. This also contributes to the increased mortalities due to high D-Dimer levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      WHAT IS KNOWN?&#xD;
&#xD;
      As high as 69% of COVID-19 patients under Critical Care have been reported to experience the&#xD;
      incidence of complication related to thromboembolism .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the use of unfractionated heparin (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) as&#xD;
      anticoagulation prophylaxis has been observed with beneficial results in decreasing COVID-19&#xD;
      mortalities, however, there are reports of high incidences of thromboembolic complications&#xD;
      despite the prophylaxis too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although prophylactic therapeutic anti coagulation has been reported with reduced incidences&#xD;
      of venous thromboembolism (VTE) , a study has shown almost similar incidence of bleeding in&#xD;
      the anticoagulation prophylaxis group as compared to the group which did not receive any&#xD;
      anticoagulation (3 versus 1.9%, p = 0.20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the link between COVID-19 related coagulopathies and mortalities has been established,&#xD;
      it is of paramount importance to establish the optimal strategy. When compared to classical&#xD;
      anticoagulants including Unfractioned Heparin, the comparatively newer salt of Apixaban&#xD;
      belonging to the Direct Oral Anti Coagulants (DOACs) class, has been reported to have&#xD;
      decreased rate of unwanted bleeding incidences, lower requirement of regular lab monitoring,&#xD;
      fewer drug-drug interactions, increased pharmacokinetic (PK) and pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      predictability and better efficacy .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to these advantages particularly the more predictable dose-response curve of Apixaban,&#xD;
      its use has markedly increased in many generalized settings in hospitals since its approval.&#xD;
      Apart from this, it is also being started in the Critical Units of COVID-19 and continued&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RELEVANCE, IMPORTANCE AND APPLICABILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators had particular interest in Apixaban in the COVID-19 setting because of the&#xD;
      easy twice daily dosing regime, decreased need of regular lab monitoring, decreased room&#xD;
      congestion, decreased medical staff exposure and consequently decreased need of Personal&#xD;
      Protective Equipment among others. Nevertheless, the anti-inflammatory effects of Apixaban by&#xD;
      decreasing plasma induced superoxide productions, are comparable to Unfractioned Heparin and&#xD;
      Low Molecular Weight Heparin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH GAP IDENTIFIED:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite these numerous purported benefits, to the best of the investigators' knowledge, there&#xD;
      are no published reports describing the clinical outcomes of apixaban use in critically ill&#xD;
      ICU patients with severe COVID-19 , in Pakistan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE OF STUDY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As such, the purpose of this study is to describe the safety and efficacy outcomes of a&#xD;
      cohort of ICU patients with severe COVID-19 respiratory disease treated with therapeutic dose&#xD;
      apixaban for COVID-19 at a tertiary public health care setting.&#xD;
