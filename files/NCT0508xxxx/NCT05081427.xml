      This study is a prospective, observational, single-center, short-term cross-sectional study&#xD;
      to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of a set of specified MRI quantitative&#xD;
      biomarkers.&#xD;

      NIMBLE is a comprehensive, five-year collaborative effort to standardize, compare, validate,&#xD;
      and advance the regulatory qualification of imaging and circulating biomarkers to diagnose&#xD;
      and stage nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH), and to predict and assess response to&#xD;
      therapeutic intervention (https://fnih.org/what-we-do/biomarkers-consortium/programs/nimble).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to assess the repeatability and reproducibility of a set of&#xD;
      specified MRI quantitative biomarkers. The imaging biomarkers will cover an array of methods&#xD;
      that could be applicable to non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD), including liver fat,&#xD;
      liver stiffness, corrected T1 relaxation time and body composition assessments. The data&#xD;
      collected will be used to inform a decision of which of these biomarkers has sufficient&#xD;
      precision to be advanced to NIMBLE Stage 2.&#xD;

        This prospective cross-sectional study will enroll subjects 18 years or older with&#xD;
        suspected or confirmed diagnosis of NAFLD. Based on protocol-specified FIB-4 values, about&#xD;
        one-third are expected to have low, one-third to have intermediate, and one-third to have&#xD;
        high likelihood of advanced fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The study will use an interim analysis, adaptive MRI protocol, and adaptive sample size. It&#xD;
        is anticipated that up to a total of 48 subjects will be enrolled and complete imaging&#xD;
        protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
        General health status: Patients with suspected or confirmed diagnosis of NAFLD and no&#xD;
        contraindications for an MRI exam.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Adult (age ≥ 18 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected NAFLD based on:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior biopsy ≤ 36 months consistent with NAFLD; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical and laboratory data ≤ 3 months before enrollment consistent with NAFLD:&#xD;
             abnormal ALT (&gt;30 U/L for men, &gt; 19 U/L for women) without other common causes such as&#xD;
             HCV, HBV AND meets criteria or ATP III criteria (2005 revision) for metabolic syndrome&#xD;
             with any 3 of the 5:&#xD;
&#xD;
             i. Waist circumference (WC) &gt; 102 cm (M) or &gt; 88 cm (F) ii. Fasting glucose ≥ 100&#xD;
             mg/dL or Rx iii. TG ≥ 150 mg/dL or Rx iv. Elevated blood pressure (SBP ≥ 130 mmHg or&#xD;
             DBP ≥ 85 mmHg) v. Reduced HDL-C &lt; 40 mg/dL (M) or &lt; 50 gm/dL (W)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able and willing to participate, including maintaining steady-state: diet, physical&#xD;
             activity, alcohol use, medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Classifiable into one of the following enrollment categories by FIB-4 (ALT, AST,&#xD;
             platelets, date of birth) collected at screening visit if not available already within&#xD;
             3 months prior:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Low likelihood of advanced fibrosis: FIB-4 ≤ 1.3 (about one-third of enrolled&#xD;
             subjects, minimum 20%, maximum 45%);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intermediate likelihood of advanced fibrosis: 1.3 &lt; FIB-4 &lt; 2.67 (about one-third of&#xD;
             enrolled subjects, minimum 20%, maximum 45%);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High likelihood of advanced fibrosis: FIB-4 ≥ 2.67: (about one-third of enrolled&#xD;
             subjects, minimum 20%, maximum 45%).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Liver disease other than NAFLD&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Excess alcohol consumption (≥ 2 units/day for women and ≥ 3 units/day for men)&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Current diagnosis of drug induced liver injury&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Receiving drug or placebo in treatment trial now or within 30 days&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Other factors that in the judgment of the PI might preclude study completion&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Women who state they are pregnant. Women who state they are pregnant will be excluded&#xD;
             in an abundance of caution, since pregnancy might increase intra-abdominal pressure&#xD;
             which in turn might affect the assessment of the different-day reproducibility&#xD;
             coefficient of MRI and VCTE measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with active implants such as pacemakers or defibrillators or any other&#xD;
             contraindication to MRI or VCTE scanning.&#xD;
