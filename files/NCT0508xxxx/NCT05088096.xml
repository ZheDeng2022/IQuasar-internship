      A reliability and validity study for the cross culturally adapted and translated version of&#xD;
      Upper limb musculoskeletal index questionnaire into Urdu language. This can be used for the&#xD;
      reporting of upper limb musculoskeletal disorders including hand, shoulder and arm&#xD;
      pathologies, carpel tunnel syndrome, osteoarthritis etc.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upper limb functional disorders are quite common among Pakistani population due to high&#xD;
      demands of work either manual or using technologies, so these disorders are also of great&#xD;
      matter of interest. Therefore, for evaluations, diagnosis and for better treatment, a&#xD;
      subjective questionnaire is required and hence, ULFI is a commonly used outcome measure for&#xD;
      upper limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been previously translated into many languages i.e. in native languages of respective&#xD;
      countries for better understanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upper limb functional index (ULFI) is originally in English language and much of the&#xD;
      Pakistani population is Urdu speaking. That is why it is required to translate the ULFI&#xD;
      questionnaire in Urdu language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Translation guidelines from Beaton and colleagues followed. The patients with upper limb&#xD;
      musculoskeletal disorders will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedure started after the approval from institution review board committee&#xD;
      with reference no. IRB-UOL-FAHS/882/2021. Data were collected from the patients after taking&#xD;
      consent from them. Data collected on their first visit and second reading taken after 1 week,&#xD;
      after that treatment will be given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reliability:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ULFI-Urdu will be applied two times by a physiotherapist to determine test-retest&#xD;
      reliability. On the first day of assessment the physiotherapist will collect demographic data&#xD;
      and patients will answer ULFI-Urdu. For intra-rater reliability, ULFI-Urdu will be reapplied&#xD;
      48 hours later. Between two assessments, no treatment will be provided to minimize clinical&#xD;
      differences. The first visit of the patient will be comprised of complete assessment along&#xD;
      with the completion of outcome measures and upon his/her second visit the patient outcome&#xD;
      measures will be completed before giving any treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validity:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Construct validity will be assessed by determining pearson correlation between ULFI-Urdu and&#xD;
      DASH, ULFI-Ur and SF-12 Ur questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin measure of sampling adequacy will be used to assess for factor&#xD;
      analysis and the Barlett test of sphericity, to ensure sampling adequacy. Reliability will be&#xD;
      assessed with Cronbach alpha, split half test and test-retest method. Floor and ceiling&#xD;
      effects will be determined by calculating the rate of participants that obtained the lowest&#xD;
      (0) or highest (80) scores and will be considered present if more than 15 % of the&#xD;
      participants achieved the highest or lowest score. Validity will be assessed by explanatory&#xD;
      factorial analysis of the ULFI scores obtained at the first meeting. Principal components&#xD;
      analysis will be performed with varimax rotation if it will be necessary. The number of&#xD;
      potential factors will be suggested by scree plot, Eugen value cut-off &gt;1.0, and 10 %&#xD;
      variance. Convergent and divergent validity will be assessed with correlation between pain at&#xD;
      rest, activity, DASH score, stiffness, physical function, total score and ULFI score.&#xD;
