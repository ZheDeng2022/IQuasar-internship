  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      TERABio Ltd. has developed a rapid screening tool intended to determine if a tested&#xD;
      individual is COVID-19-free (Negative to COVID-19).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of the pilot is to perform a localized validation to the TERA Bio Tests by TERA Bio&#xD;
      Station(s). Success Criteria: Clearing at least 80% of the healthy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot duration: approx. 6-10 work weeks long.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Population Requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Male and Female, age ≥ 18 years old, whose COVID-19 virus infection status is known and&#xD;
      verified for at least the last 24 hours (prior to the TERA.Bio test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a minimum of 300 tested Positive individuals and a minimum of 700&#xD;
      Negative individuals, tested during the 24 hours prior to the TERA.Bio test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional PCR tests on specific individuals, based on their symptomatic status and/or their&#xD;
      PCR's CT value may be required be done 3 days after taking the breath test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that each day will contain both Positive and Negative individuals in a similar&#xD;
      ratio to the overall expected one (30%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Test Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A staff member will explain to the tested individual about the test and will hand him an&#xD;
      informed consent form. The tested individual will review and sign the consent form and return&#xD;
      it to the staff member. The individual must sign the informed consent form in order to&#xD;
      participate in the pilot testing. The individual's breath sample is then taken by blowing&#xD;
      three times into a disposable TERATube. Thereafter, the tube is sealed, sterilized, and&#xD;
      scanned by the TERA Bio Station for analysis of its bio-chemical spectral signature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blind Test objectives and method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following data analytics of the previous phase and once achieving sufficient testing, a blind&#xD;
      test may be performed to validate the accuracy of the TERA.Bio test. The blind test will&#xD;
      include 60 individuals from which 30 must be Positive for COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blind test's tested individuals will be tested in the exact way the pilot testing was&#xD;
      performed and with RT-PCR with the exact same CT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TERA.Bio's team will conduct the breath tests scanning and decoding procedure without&#xD;
      obtaining the RT-PCR results in-advance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TERA.Bio team will send predictions for each tested individual (suspected\negative) to&#xD;
      the pilot manager and primary investigator after ALL pilot participants have been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RT-PCR results will then be sent to the TERA.Bio team. The two parties will compare the&#xD;
      results obtained from the TERA Bio Station to the results from the RT-PCR.&#xD;
