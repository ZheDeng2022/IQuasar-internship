  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of a molecular&#xD;
      drug-sensitivity test-guided individualized shorter all-oral regimen composed of 4-5&#xD;
      anti-tuberculosis drugs recommended by WHO in RRTB patients for 9-12 months in real-world&#xD;
      practice, in some high RR-TB burden province of China. This study hopes to form a clinical&#xD;
      pathway of all oral short-term treatment based on the guidance of rapid molecular drug&#xD;
      sensitivity that can be popularized in China, and update the Chinese guidelines of RR-TB&#xD;
      treatment management.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This trial is a multi-centre prospective observational cohort study. The purpose of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate an individualized 9-12 month all-oral regimen in RRTB patients confirmed&#xD;
      by phenotypic or molecular rifampicin sensitivity test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 3000 participants with a shorter all-oral regimen and receiving clinical care at&#xD;
      study sites will be estimated. Drug resistance to RIF, FQs, SLIDs, INH, Eto and PZA was&#xD;
      evaluated before enrollment. After screening for eligibility, treatment regimen is&#xD;
      individually designed in this trial by responsible physicians at study sites based on&#xD;
      radiological, clinical, bacteriological as well as drug sensitivity test results. Candidate&#xD;
      anti-TB drugs are BDQ, LZD, FQs, Cs, Cfz, Z, Dlm and INH. Follow-up visits are conducted&#xD;
      monthly until end of treatment. After end of treatment, follow-up visits were conducted every&#xD;
      3 months for the first 6 months and then every 6 months until 24 months after&#xD;
      discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate end of treatment outcomes. Favorable outcomes include&#xD;
      cured and treatment completed. Unfavorable outcomes include treatment failed, lost to&#xD;
      follow-up and died.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to assess the median time to sputum culture conversion, frequency&#xD;
      of and time to relapse and frequency of recurrence-free survival. Safety evaluations&#xD;
      performed are the routine lab tests, blood glucose, hearing, vital signs, electrocardiograph&#xD;
      (ECG), reporting of adverse events, physical examinations and chest CT. Adverse events will&#xD;
      be monitored and promptly managed during the whole treatment course.&#xD;
