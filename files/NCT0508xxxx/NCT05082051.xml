  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Phase 1a/1b single and multiple ascending dose study of oral CDX-7108 in healthy adult&#xD;
      subjects and a single dose proof-of-concept study of oral CDX-7108 in subjects with exocrine&#xD;
      pancreatic insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      No clinical studies have yet been performed with CDX-7108 and its effects in humans are&#xD;
      unknown. This is the first-in-human (FIH) study of CDX-7108, which aims to assess the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK) of escalating single and multiple oral doses of CDX-7108&#xD;
      in healthy adult subjects and to evaluate the pharmacodynamics of a single dose of oral&#xD;
      CDX-7108 in a proof-of-concept (POC) study in subjects with exocrine pancreatic insufficiency&#xD;
      (EPI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an integrated 3-part study to investigate the safety, tolerability, PK, and PD of&#xD;
      CDX-7108. The Parts A and B are randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled dose escalation&#xD;
      parts to investigate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity, and PK of CDX-7108 after&#xD;
      single and multiple oral dose administration in healthy adult subjects. Part C is a&#xD;
      randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose, 2-way crossover part to assess POC&#xD;
      of CDX-7108 in terms of PD as well as its safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity in&#xD;
      subjects with EPI. The study will commence with Part A (single ascending dose [SAD] study)&#xD;
      and will progress to Part B (multiple ascending dose [MAD] study), and Part C (POC study)&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. Subject has any clinically significant abnormalities at Screening in rhythm,&#xD;
             conduction or morphology of the resting ECG and any clinically significant&#xD;
             abnormalities in the 12-lead ECG, as considered by the Investigator, that may&#xD;
             interfere with the interpretation of QTc interval changes including abnormal ST-T wave&#xD;
             morphology.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subject has prolonged QTcF &gt;450 msec for male subjects or &gt;470 msec for female&#xD;

&#xD;
         13. Treatment with any investigational drug or device/treatment within the 30 days or 5&#xD;
             half-lives of the drug (whichever is longer) prior to the administration of IP.&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Known allergy or adverse reaction history to any component of the CDX-7108 oral dose&#xD;

&#xD;
         15. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;
             pulmonary, cardiovascular, hepatic, psychiatric, neurologic, or allergic disease&#xD;
             (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies&#xD;
             and childhood asthma) at time of Screening or IP administration, that in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator may put the subject at greater safety risk, influence response to&#xD;
             study drug, or interfere with study assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
         16. Current or chronic history of GI disorders or conditions interfering with normal GI&#xD;
             anatomy or function. Examples include GI bypass surgery, partial or total gastrectomy,&#xD;

             barbiturates, benzodiazepines, methadone, and methamphetamines) and alcohol (breath&#xD;
             test). However, there is the option to re-screen once during the Screening period at&#xD;
             the discretion of the Investigator or delegate in the case of a positive result at&#xD;
             Screening for a prescribed medication, eg, codeine.&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Subject has any clinically significant abnormalities in hematology, coagulation,&#xD;
             clinical chemistry, or urinalysis at Screening as judged by the Investigator,&#xD;
             including aspartate aminotransferase (AST) or ALT &gt;1.5 times above the ULN. Repeat&#xD;
             measurements are allowed at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed medication in the 2 weeks preceding the first&#xD;
             dose of IP. EXCEPTION: Subjects who have received approved vaccines (including&#xD;
             approved COVID-19 vaccines) may be allowed if these vaccines are taken no less than 72&#xD;
             hours prior to the IP dose at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Part C (Proof-of-Concept Study)&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Evidence or history of clinically significant hematological, renal, endocrine,&#xD;

             (including drug allergies, but excluding untreated, asymptomatic, seasonal allergies&#xD;
             and childhood asthma) at time of Screening or IP administration, that in the opinion&#xD;
             of the Investigator may put the subject at greater safety risk, influence response to&#xD;
             study drug, or interfere with study assessments. NOTE: Subjects with treated diabetes&#xD;
             secondary to CP or pancreatectomy are allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Subject has any clinically significant abnormalities in hematology, coagulation,&#xD;
             clinical chemistry, or urinalysis at Screening as judged by the Investigator,&#xD;
             including AST or ALT &gt;1.5 times above the ULN, or cholesterol or triglycerides &gt;400&#xD;
             mg/dL. Repeat measurements are allowed at the discretion of the Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Current or chronic history of GI disorders or conditions interfering with normal GI&#xD;

&#xD;
         23. Use of any prescribed or nonprescribed medication potentially interfering with gastric&#xD;
             pH, intestinal motility, or fat absorption, including herbal and dietary supplements&#xD;
             and antacids; these medications shall be stopped for a minimum of 5 times their&#xD;
             half-life before IP administration if, in the opinion of the Investigator, this does&#xD;
             not represent a risk for the subject's wellbeing. EXCEPTIONS:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Histamine H2 receptor antagonists, PPI, insulin, analgesics, and chronic pain&#xD;
             medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Oral contraceptives, paracetamol, or multivitamins. Subjects who have received&#xD;
             approved vaccines (including approved COVID-19 vaccines) may be allowed if these&#xD;
             vaccines are taken no less than 72 hours prior to the IP dose at the discretion of the&#xD;
             Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Use of antibiotics within 8 days before the Pancreo-Lip breath test at Screening or&#xD;
