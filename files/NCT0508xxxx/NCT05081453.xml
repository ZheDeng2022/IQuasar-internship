      Joint dysplasias consist of alterations in the normal development of a joint. In these cases,&#xD;
      the formation of the normally congruent joint surfaces is altered, producing functional&#xD;
      abnormalities that, depending on the degree of dysplasia, can lead to a spectrum of clinical&#xD;
      manifestations ranging from complete dislocation, subluxations, severe instabilities, and&#xD;
      ultimately early osteoarthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most studied joint dysplasia is developmental dysplasia of the hip (CDD) where the head&#xD;
      of the femur and the acetabulum present different degrees of malformation, giving rise to a&#xD;
      non-congruent joint. The clinical spectrum of manifestations of this pathology varies from a&#xD;
      complete dislocation to milder forms of dysplasia that can manifest in childhood, youth or&#xD;
      adulthood as early osteoarthritis, sometimes requiring multiple interventions for its&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early detection methods for CDD include: the identification of prenatal risk factors&#xD;
      (intrauterine position, family history, first-born…), exploration through specific maneuvers,&#xD;
      and confirmation by imaging tests such as ultrasound at birth. The early treatment of CDD&#xD;
      consists of the application of a Pavlik harness whose purpose is to keep the newborn in a&#xD;
      full-time position (frog position) in which the head of the femur remains completely&#xD;
      congruent with the acetabulum, allowing the dysplasia to be reversed in early ages. Thanks to&#xD;
      these early detection methods and its early treatment (with minimal adverse effects), many of&#xD;
      these clinical alterations that previously went unnoticed have been prevented, and whose late&#xD;
      treatment involves surgeries with a degree of invasiveness inversely related to the time of&#xD;
      detection of DDC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The knee is another joint susceptible to developing dysplasia. The most frequent dysplasia of&#xD;
      the knee joint involves the femoropatellar joint (FP) formed by the patella and the femoral&#xD;
      trochlea. Its normal function is vital to be able to flex and extend the leg since the&#xD;
      patella acts as a lever arm increasing the strength of the quadriceps. Therefore, it is a&#xD;
      joint subjected to high tensile forces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the normal knee in extension, the concave patella is located in the most proximal part of&#xD;
      the femur without having any contact with the convex femoral trochlea. As the knee is bent,&#xD;
      the patella runs into the deep femoral groove (normal groove angle 135º), which acts as&#xD;
      containment and allows it to slide distally as the knee is bent further. It is in these knee&#xD;
      flexion positions, more than 90º, where there exist more tensional forces between both&#xD;
      articular surfaces.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Developmental trochlear femoral dysplasia (DTFD), therefore, consists of the abnormal&#xD;
      development of both articular surfaces resulting in a non-congruent joint. However, unlike&#xD;
      CDD, it is not detected early since it generally manifests in adolescence in the form of&#xD;
      recurrent dislocations with minimal trauma in severe cases. Recurrent patellar dislocations&#xD;
      are a serious and complex problem for both the patient and the surgeon since in adolescence&#xD;
      it is not possible to reverse DTFD and surgeries to generate a normal trochlear groove&#xD;
      (trochleoplasty) can have catastrophic results generating disability and lameness for life in&#xD;
      a not inconsiderable percentage of patients. Milder forms of dysplasia that do not appear in&#xD;
      adolescence produce instabilities or subluxations and alterations in the patellar tracking&#xD;
      that trigger recurrent knee pain and often end up producing early osteoarthritis in young&#xD;
      patients. The treatment of this type of patient is also not very rewarding and sometimes they&#xD;
      require surgeries at an early age with poor results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fact that DTFD manifests itself late during adolescence, has biased the scientific&#xD;
      community to focus its efforts on research related to the surgical treatment of this&#xD;
      pathology and not on its prevention at an early age, as is the case with DDC. However, more&#xD;
      recent studies are focusing their objectives on the early detection and etiological analysis&#xD;
      of this structural anomaly in order to prevent it. Specifically, investigators conducted a&#xD;
      study in newborns with early ultrasound in order to identify risk factors related to PRDD.&#xD;
      These investigators concluded that the intrauterine breech position at birth was 45 times&#xD;
      more likely to develop DTFD than the cephalic position.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the etiology of DTFD is not clear, more and more studies point to the idea that the&#xD;
      lack of a mechanical stimulus by the patella in the femoral sulcus causes both articular&#xD;
      surfaces not to develop normally. According to a study that developed an experimental study&#xD;
      in newborn rats resecting the patella, the morphological development of the femoral trochlea&#xD;
      is influenced by its abnormal mechanical stress. This hypothesis has also been reinforced by&#xD;
      the work of other investigators where, in an experimental study in growing rabbits, they&#xD;
      observed the development of DTFD in those rabbits in which they produced a permanent patella&#xD;
      dislocation (avoiding the contact of the patella on the femoral trochlea). These findings&#xD;
      would also justify those previously described by where it was observed that those newborns in&#xD;
      a breech position with their legs extended (in extension, the patella is located proximal to&#xD;
      the femoral groove and does not exert the mechanical stimulus necessary for normal groove&#xD;
      development) had a higher incidence of DTFD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These investigations support the hypothesis that the absence of mechanical stimulation of the&#xD;
      patella on the femoral trochlea leads to an alteration in its development, producing DTFD.&#xD;
      This situation led two different researchers to carry out different studies in order to find&#xD;
      out whether in those cases with DTFD, dysplasia could be reversed by returning the mechanical&#xD;
      stimulus of the patella to the trochlea. A study demonstrated that dislocation and subsequent&#xD;
      reduction of the patellofemoral joint could reverse DTFD in growing rabbits and other&#xD;
      investigators showed that realignment surgery could remodel the dysplastic trochlea at very&#xD;
      young ages in a human clinical study after an eleven-year follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These findings suggest that it is possible to identify DTFD early in newborns with risk&#xD;
      factors using ultrasound and that there is the possibility of modeling the dysplastic&#xD;
      trochlea if the necessary mechanical stimulation is achieved by the patella. However,&#xD;
      although there is evidence that this situation can be reversed, so far no clinical study has&#xD;
      been developed in neonates with DTFD to assess the effect of different interventions.&#xD;
      Currently, it is more than known that keeping the knee at 90º of flexion is when there are&#xD;
      greater contact forces between the patella and the trochlea. As in DDC, this position could&#xD;
      be maintained in newborns with DTFD by using a harness, with the intention of achieving&#xD;
      constant and permanent mechanical stimulation of the patella on the dysplastic trochlea that&#xD;
      allows modeling the dysplastic groove. during the early growth phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That is why the investigators propose the development of a randomized, double-blind clinical&#xD;
      trial with the aim of early identification by ultrasound of newborns with risk factors for&#xD;
      the development of DTFD and subsequently evaluate the result of treatment with a harness that&#xD;
      maintains the knee at 90º flexion for two months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis under study is based on the fact that early identification and treatment of&#xD;
      DTFD in newborns using a harness could model the dysplastic trochlea and prevent this&#xD;
      malformation and its consequences in the short and long term, as is the case with DDC.&#xD;
