    <measure>Change from baseline (day 1) in Motor disease society- Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale Part III total score for the patient in the &quot;off-state&quot; (without L-dopa for previous eight hours)</measure>
    <time_frame>measured on day 1, 2, 3, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale Part III total score is the cumulative score of a 33 question assessment of disease impact on patient's ability to move, with each part scored on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being no effect of disease and 4 being severe disease. a total score of 0 indicates no disease and a total score of 132 indicates the most severe disease</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in the length of time during which L-dopa therapy is ineffective in reducing motor symptoms of disease (OFF time)</measure>
    <time_frame>off time will be measured/recorded every day from day 2 to day 27</time_frame>
    <description>The total sum of time in which a patient self categorizes themselves as in the &quot;off&quot; state determined by diary entries. 0 hours is the minimum/best score, which indicates continuous L-dopa-like activity for the 24 hour period. 24 hours is the worst score and indicates that there was no L-dopa-like benefit at any time during the 24 hour period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in average Motor disease society- Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale Part III total score measured over the course of 8 hours after taking L-dopa and/or NE3107</measure>
    <time_frame>measured on day 1, 2, 3, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>An average score will be calculated from assessments of the Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale Part III total score, which is the cumulative score of a 33 question assessment of disease impact on patient's ability to move, with each question scored on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being no effect of disease and 4 being severe disease. a total score of 0 indicates no disease and a total score of 132 indicates the most severe disease. Scores will be collected several times during the eight hours following L-dopa and/or NE3107 administration.</description>

    <measure>Motor disease society- Unified Parkinson's disease rating scale Part I total score</measure>
    <time_frame>measured on day 1, 2, 3, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>the cumulative score of a 13 question assessment of disease impact on patient's cognitive impairment, with each question scored on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being no effect of disease and 4 being severe disease. a total score of 0 indicates no disease and a total score of 42 indicates the most severe disease. This test asks about the impact of disease on cognition, but does not directly measure cognitive capability.</description>

    <time_frame>measured on day 1, 2, 3, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>the cumulative score of a 13 question assessment of disease impact on patient's Motor Aspects of Experiences of Daily Living, with each question scored on a scale of 0-4, with 0 being no effect of disease and 4 being a severe effect. a total score of 0 indicates no disease and a total score of 42 indicates the most severe disease.</description>

    <measure>Change from baseline in the length of time during which L-dopa-like effects are felt by the patient</measure>
    <time_frame>baseline and day 1, 2, 3, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The total sum of time in which a patient self categorizes themselves as in the &quot;on&quot; state, with or without dyskinesia determined by diary entries. 0 hours is the minimum/worst score, which indicates no L-dopa-like activity for the 24 hour period. 24 hours is the best score and indicates that there was no L-dopa-like benefit at any time during the 24 hour period.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline in L-dopa induced dyskinesia measured with the abnormal involuntary movement scale (AIMS)</measure>
    <time_frame>AIMS will be measured during the 8 hour period of observation on Day 1, 2, 3, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>AIMS is a 12-item clinician-rated scale to assess severity of dyskinesias (orofacial movements and extremity and truncal movements) in patients taking L-dopa. Questions assess the overall severity, incapacitation, and the patient's level of awareness of the movements, and distress associated with them. Questions are scored from 0 (no symptom) to 4 (severe). the minimum total score of 0 indicates no dyskinesia and the maximum total score of 48 indicates severe dyskinesia.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>change from baseline in time to onset of L-dopa-like activity</measure>
    <time_frame>measured on Day 1, 2, 3, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>Length of time from L-dopa administration to beginning of L-dopa activity producing &quot;on-state&quot;. Patient self assessment of the time L-dopa-like activity begins after L-dopa administration. A decrease in the time to onset may shorten the time in the off-state and be considered a patient benefit. An increase in time to onset may lengthen time in the off-state and be considered a general worsening of response to treatment.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Non-Motor Symptom Assessment Scale for Parkinson Disease (NMSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured on Day 1, 2, 3, 14, and 28</time_frame>
    <description>The Non-Motor Symptoms Scale (NMSS) is a 30-item rater-based scale to assess a wide range of non-motor symptoms in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The NMSS measures the severity and frequency of non-motor symptoms across nine dimensions. The scale can be used for patients at all stages of PD. For each question, scores of severity (0 to 3, with 0 being none and 3 being major source of distress) and frequency (1 to 4, 1= rarely and 4 = very frequent) are recorded and the product of the two calculated. The sum of the products yields the overall score. The minimum total score of 0 indicates no non-motor symptoms and the maximum score of 360 indicates severe disease.</description>
