  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Maintaining adequate physical activity (PA) and regularly exercising are very important to&#xD;
      promote the good physical and mental health of the elderly. According to the transtheoretical&#xD;
      model (TTM) framework, previous research studies have formulated many strategies to promote&#xD;
      exercise behaviors, such as incentive strategies, combines municipal resources and links up&#xD;
      with the referral of primary care institutions, or including patients in the decision-making&#xD;
      process about exercise choices to enable patients to have greater autonomy. In addition, in&#xD;
      terms of the strategic aspects of achieving goals, competitive incentives are also an&#xD;
      effective strategy. Therefore, this study aims to find out the effects of the community-based&#xD;
      physical fitness exercise course, which is given according to TTM, on improving functional&#xD;
      fitness and exercise persistence of the older adults.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a single group trial, according to the pre-test result of the exercise stage of the change questionnaire, they were divided into the maintenance phase group (MP, N=15) and under the maintenance phase group (MPb, N=15). All subjects joined the community-based physical fitness exercise course for 24 weeks. To quantify the effect of this intervention method on functional fitness and exercise persistence of the elderly, this study analyzed the related exercise behavior changes of MPb and MP elderly.</intervention_model_description>

    <measure>Exercise stage of change questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>basal, 12, 24 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>Exercise Change Stage Short Question Form is a 5 item scale. It has only one question, used to categorizes individuals into one of the five stages of change: (1) Precontemplation (2) Contemplation (3) Preparation (4) Action (5) Maintenance.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE)</measure>
    <time_frame>basal, 12, 24 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>PASE is used to assess the physical activity level of elderly individuals, the factors affecting the activity level, the relationship between physical activity and health profile. The minimum and maximum score that can be obtained from the scale is 0 and 400.The higher score indicates better level of physical activity.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Exercise Self-efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>basal, 12, 24 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Exercise Self-efficacy Scale measures an individual's perceived ability to overcome various obstacles to perform physical activity, with higher scores indicating more confidence in performing the exercise.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>basal, 12, 24 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The Outcome Expectations for Exercise Scale contains 9 statements rated by participants using a 5-point Likert scale from 1 &quot;Strongly Disagree&quot; to 5 &quot;Strongly Agree&quot;. It can help identify older adults with low outcome expectations for exercise.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Physical Activity Survey</measure>
    <time_frame>basal, 12, 24 weeks follow up</time_frame>
    <description>The physical activity survey is measured according to the PASE items. It is calculated by the frequency value (hours per day in the one-week reporting period) for low-intensity, medium-intensity, high-intensity, and muscle strengthening exercise. The higher score indicates the more time spent on the physical activity at each level.</description>
