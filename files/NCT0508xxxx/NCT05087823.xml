  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess sample collection conditions for various dietary&#xD;
      challenges (fat, sugar, and mixed) and determine the optimal fasting and post-meal sample&#xD;
      collection time points for future studies on a larger group of individuals. Study&#xD;
      participants will attend three study visits where they take part in lipid, glucose, and mixed&#xD;
      meal challenges. At each of the three visits, participants will provide venous blood samples&#xD;
      and a urine sample before consuming the test meal and will provide 6 additional venous finger&#xD;
      blood samples post-meal.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the leading killer of Americans, accounting for more than&#xD;
      800,000 deaths each year. A vital step in reducing the number of heart disease-related deaths&#xD;
      in the U.S. is to identify those at probable risk. The Clinical Chemistry Branch (CCB) in the&#xD;
      Division of Laboratory Sciences (DLS) at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)&#xD;
      has developed advanced analytical methods for assessing the risk for lipid metabolism related&#xD;
      diseases, including CVD. This comprehensive analytical method measures levels of protein and&#xD;
      lipid constituents of lipoprotein size and density classes (e.g. high-density lipoprotein&#xD;
      (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL)) in blood. The&#xD;
      analytical method uses asymmetric flow-field flow fractionation (AF4) to separate lipoprotein&#xD;
      classes (HDL, LDL, VLDL) in serum or plasma into size fractions, and in each fraction&#xD;
      quantifies over 50 CVD-linked biomarkers by isotope dilution tandem mass spectrometry. The&#xD;
      CCB plans to apply the measurement of this wide array of biomarkers in future epidemiologic&#xD;
      investigations of CVD. These studies have the potential to expand the number of&#xD;
      diagnostically relevant CVD risk factors that currently are limited to cholesterol and&#xD;
      triglyceride measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there is limited information about how the CVD-linked biomarkers measured with the&#xD;
      CCB's method are affected by blood collection conditions and the fasting/non-fasting state of&#xD;
      individuals. Furthermore, lipid metabolism is very dynamic and the absolute levels of&#xD;
      biomarkers are strongly affected by each individual's diet, lifestyle, gender, age, and&#xD;
      physiology. Thus, assessing biomarkers related to lipid metabolism is most effective in a&#xD;
      pre- and post-test comparison (i.e. fasting vs. after a test meal) with controlled lipid and&#xD;
      carbohydrate content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves three different meal challenges on three separate days with approximately&#xD;
      two weeks in between. The first meal challenge will involve the consumption of a standardized&#xD;
      mixture of dietary fats (lipid challenge), the second meal challenge will be a sugar&#xD;
      sweetened beverage (glucose challenge) and the third meal challenge will be a nutrition shake&#xD;
      (mixed meal challenge). At each of the three visits, each individual will provide both venous&#xD;
      and finger-prick blood samples and a urine sample before consuming the test meal (in a&#xD;
      fasting state) and 6 additional venous and finger-prick blood samples post-meal at described&#xD;
      intervals. Each study visit will last approximately 8 hours.&#xD;

    <measure>Change in high-density lipoprotein (HDL) Size</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Minute 15, Minute 30, Hour 1, Hour 2, Hour 4 and Hour 6 during study visits 1, 2, and 3 (up to 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>HDL concentration size profiles for each time-point will be determined for each of the three meal challenges. HDL is considered to be anti- atherogenic because of its ability deplete excess cholesterol accumulating necrotic cores and repair arterial lesions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) Size</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Minute 15, Minute 30, Hour 1, Hour 2, Hour 4 and Hour 6 during study visits 1, 2, and 3 (up to 6 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>LDL concentration size profiles for each time-point will be determined for each of the three meal challenges. LDL is considered to be atherogenic because it is likely to be trapped inside the intima of blood vessels and arteries and initiate inflammatory response, foam-cell formation, and smooth muscle cell proliferation, leading to development necrotic cores, lesions, plaques and their eventual rupture. Elevated LDL has been thought to contribute to atherosclerotic events, however, research has also observed coronary events occurring in individuals with LDL levels in the acceptable range.</description>
