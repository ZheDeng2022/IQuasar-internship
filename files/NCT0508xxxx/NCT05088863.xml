      A survey designed to examine how consumers adapt their diet in response to health claim&#xD;
      messaging.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      384 participants will be recruited to participate (n=32/group) ensuring equal numbers based&#xD;
      on gender (men and women), income (low and medium-high), and age (18-35, 36-55, &gt;56 years).&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to prepare a 3-day food record representative of their current&#xD;
      dietary intake. Participants will then be told, &quot;Health Canada has approved the following&#xD;
      health claim: 40g of ground flaxseed per day has been shown to help lower cholesterol, which&#xD;
      is a risk factor for heart disease.&quot; Without any further guidance, participants will then be&#xD;
      asked to modify their diet to achieve 40g per day of flaxseeds for the following 2 weeks.&#xD;
      They will be asked to prepare another 3-day food record so we can see if/how their diet&#xD;
      changed. At the end of the 2-week period, participants will be asked if they were successful&#xD;
      with the changes and what barriers they faced in implementing these changes. This survey will&#xD;
      be accomplished remotely with informed consent and communication with participants happening&#xD;
      over the phone or videoconference. Participants will mail the food records to clinical trial&#xD;
      staff. Analysis of food records will identify the food choices used to achieve dietary&#xD;
      change, if these changes altered nutrient intake compared to their usual diet and if they&#xD;
      were able to achieve the target laid out (ie. 40g flaxseed per day). A questionnaire will be&#xD;
      used to identify barriers to implementation of dietary change (ie. price, availability,&#xD;
      sensory aspects of food, ease of preparation).&#xD;
