    <textblock>
      This study was a retrospective cohort study of patients to assess the early insights into&#xD;
      real-world safety among wet AMD patients initiating brolucizumab. Evidence was generated to&#xD;
      describe their patient characteristics and clinical outcomes. The study was conducted using&#xD;
      the IRIS Registry.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      IRIS Registry EHR data from patients with wet AMD who initiated brolucizumab were analyzed in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identification period of the index date (index period): The patients fulfilling the selection&#xD;
      criteria was identified&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Index date: Defined as the date of the earliest brolucizumab injection&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study Period: The period from the first patient eye exposure to brolucizumab to the last&#xD;
           follow-up recorded&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-index period: The period 36 months prior to the index date. Data within 36 months&#xD;
           prior to the index date will be used to assess baseline characteristics.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-index period: The period 180 days after the index date&#xD;
