  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The fear of oral surgeries is mostly dedicated to pain and swelling in the following days. It&#xD;
      is not surprising, that it is of high interest to do anything to reduce these consequences.&#xD;
      Maybe this is a reason, why using platelet concentrates in oral health rehabilitation has&#xD;
      become common in the last couple of years. Less swelling, less pain, quicker healing. The&#xD;
      aims of the present study are to determine the effect of a platelet rich fibrin on&#xD;
      postsurgical inflammatory complications and patient-centred outcomes and perceptions, in&#xD;
      patients undergoing third molar extractions by split mouth technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      25 medically healthy adults will be assigned to one of 2 groups (1 test- and 1 control&#xD;
      group). This means due to the split mouth technique patients undergo a third molar extraction&#xD;
      twice. The first time the patient will be randomly assigned to the test- or control group and&#xD;
      the second time the patient will be in the other group (test or control group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test groups socket will be filled with a PRF (platelet-rich fibrin)-Clot before suturing&#xD;
      the wound during third molar surgery. As well, a blood count and coagulations values will be&#xD;
      determined. The control group will be operated conventionally. Swelling will be measured at&#xD;
      day 1, 3 and 7 post surgery by CBCT (cone-beam computed tomography) facial scan. Subjects&#xD;
      will be examined clinically by examiners at the seventh day after surgery for postoperative&#xD;
      complications. In addition, Visual analogue scores (VAS) on pain, swelling and bleeding will&#xD;
      be obtained from the patients from day 0 through day 7. The present study will answer an&#xD;
      important clinical question with regards to the recommendation of platelet-rich fibrin usage&#xD;
      to prevent post-operative complications with third molar surgery and to recommend a&#xD;
      platelet-rich fibrin, if required.&#xD;

Scans will be superimposed and compared with Romexis software. Manual measurement: Lines between lateral corner of the eye- jaw angle, Tragus- outer Mouth corner, Tragus-Pogonion will be measured in mm and be compared pre-surgical and at day 1, 3, 7 and 14 post-surgical.</description>
