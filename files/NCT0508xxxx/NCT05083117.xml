  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a multiregional, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2 study in&#xD;
      patients with confirmed symptomatic COVID-19, designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      efficacy, and PK of XW001 (IL-29 analog) inhalation solution. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate whether treatment with XW001 reduces the likelihood of worsening disease in patients&#xD;
      with severe COVID-19. Hospitalized patients on oxygen therapy by mask or nasal prongs&#xD;
      (WHO-OSCI score 4) will be enrolled.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Treatment arm patients will receive inhaled XW001 1 mg and placebo arm patients will receive&#xD;
      volume-matching placebo 1 mL, once daily, using a commercially available nebulizer for up to&#xD;
      14 days. Treatment should be continued until discharge or progression to score 6 or higher&#xD;
      but maximum up to 14 days. Dosing must be started within 48 hours of hospitalization. In&#xD;
      addition, both the treatment groups will receive SoC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a pilot in the development phase and comprising approximately 120&#xD;
      patients. An independent, external Data Monitoring Committee (DMC) will review all the&#xD;
      preliminary clinical data available, including safety, tolerability, efficacy, and PK for the&#xD;
      first 20 patients. The decision to recruit the subsequent 100 patients will solely depend on&#xD;
      safety and tolerability.&#xD;
