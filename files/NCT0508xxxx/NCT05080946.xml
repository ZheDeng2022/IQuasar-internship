&#xD;
          -  Histology confirmed, or clinical suspicion of, invasive epithelial ovarian, fallopian&#xD;
             tube, or peritoneal carcinoma. Must be grade 2 or 3. Serous, endometrioid, or&#xD;

          -  Planned for neoadjuvant chemotherapy (platinum-based doublet with taxane +/- anti-VEGF&#xD;
             antibody) for at least 3 but no more than 5 cycles followed by an interval debulking&#xD;
             surgery. [Note: this study evaluates response while on neoadjuvant treatment. The&#xD;
             final collection of specimen and questionnaire is at the time of surgery and immediate&#xD;
             post-operative state. Therefore, there are no eligibility criteria related to&#xD;
             treatment in the adjuvant setting (e.g., intraperitoneal treatment) and adjuvant&#xD;
             therapy should proceed as the physician deems appropriate.]&#xD;
