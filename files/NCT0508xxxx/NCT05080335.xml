  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will conduct a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing two different&#xD;
      educational approaches on the healthcare of transgender and gender expansive (TGE) youth.&#xD;
      Finding best practices to educate healthcare providers and the community at large stand to&#xD;
      make an impact on the mental health of TGE youth by helping them feel more welcome and better&#xD;
      understood by the communities in which they live.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are to evaluate two educational interventions: 1) The inclusion of a video&#xD;
      clip component of two TGE youth (Video [V] vs No video [N]) into a one-hour didactic; and 2)&#xD;
      The delivery of the same didactic content by a cis- [C] vs a trans-gender [TG] woman.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a randomized control trial (RCT) of equal allotment to one of four parallel&#xD;
      didactic conditions. The investigators will randomly assign participants to one of the four&#xD;
      teaching conditions: 1) Trans Video [TV]; 2) Trans No video [TN]; 3) Cis Video [CV]; and 4)&#xD;
      Cis No video [CN]. Participants will complete a baseline assessment (PRE) before the start of&#xD;
      the didactic but delivered in the four different ways described above. This design will help&#xD;
      the investigators make comparisons across video use (yes/no), about type of presenter&#xD;
      (trans/cis), and about the interaction of the two approaches. For the 'no video' conditions&#xD;
      (TN, CN), the didactic will not include the videos until after completion of the POST&#xD;
      assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design will ensure that all participants will receive the exact same didactic&#xD;
      content during whichever session they attend. All participants will then receive a follow&#xD;
      questionnaire two weeks later (2WK POST) to assess content retention.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Attitudes toward Transgender Men and Women (ATTMW) scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Before / after viewing videos (within 10 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>Attitudes toward Transgender Men and Women (ATTMW; Billard, 2018) is a scale to measure transphobia attitudes. It is a 24-item scale consisting of two similar but non-identical 12-item subscales, one for transgender males (ATTM), and one for women (ATTW). In this study, the study team will assign only one of the two subscales, according to the condition that subjects as randomly assigned to: those viewing the transgender adolescent male will be assigned to the ATTM; those to the female, to the ATTW. The results of both subscales are compatible with each other and can be merged into a single ATTMW score. Each of the items is a statement on which participants are asked to rate their agreement on a 7-point Likert-type scale: from 1 (strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Higher scores indicate greater anti-transgender prejudice, while lower scores indicate less prejudice.&#xD;
The first 9 items are the same for the ATTM and ATTW. Items 10-12 are unique for each of the two scales.</description>

    <measure>Change in transgender attitudes: feelings thermometer</measure>
    <time_frame>Before / after viewing videos (within 10 minutes)</time_frame>
    <description>This study will utilize a scale called feelings thermometer, modeled after Norton and Herek, 2013:&#xD;
&quot;Using a scale from zero to 100, please tell us your personal feelings toward each of the following groups of friends, teachers, or colleagues. As you do this task, think of an imaginary thermometer. The warmer or more favorable you feel toward the group, the higher the number you should give it. The colder or less favorable you feel, the lower the number. If you feel neither warm nor cold toward the group, rate it 50.&quot; To familiarize respondents with the response format, they will be first presented with thermometers for &quot;Men in general&quot; and &quot;Women in general,&quot; with each respondent rating her or his own sex first. Next, they rate different gender groups (transgender males, transgender females). Higher ratings (maximum 100) indicate warmer, more favorable feelings toward the target whereas lower ratings (minimum 0) indicate colder, more negative feelings.</description>
