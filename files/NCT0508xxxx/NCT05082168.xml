  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Capnodynamic monitoring has the potential to offer continuous and non-invasive measurements&#xD;
      of heart and lung function in patients requiring ventilation in an intensive care setting.&#xD;
      Since mechanical ventilation with full patient synchronization is commonly used in ICU,&#xD;
      capnodynamic monitoring can be immediately embedded in clinical care and compared to current&#xD;
      methods of monitoring cardiac output, lung volumes and oxygen delivery. This observational&#xD;
      study will explore capnodynamic monitoring in mechanically ventilated patients with a range&#xD;
      of cardiorespiratory compromise.&#xD;

      This study aims to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. compare the estimation of cardiac output (CO) using the capnodynamic method (COEPBF)&#xD;
           with contemporary reference methods;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. compare the estimation of mixed venous oxygen saturation (SmvO2) with invasively&#xD;
           obtained blood gas analyses;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. generate observational data on end-expiratory lung volume (EELV) when ventilator&#xD;
           settings, and in particular PEEP, are changed;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. combine 1-3 to provide a physiological construct of cardiorespiratory function&#xD;

    <description>In patients fully synchronized with mechanical ventilation, the capnodynamic method calculates the effective pulmonary blood flow, the end-expiratory lung volume and estimates the mixed venous oxygen saturation. The capnodynamic method uses short inspiratory or expiratory pauses to induce small changes in CO2 concentration the enable the mole balance to be resolved for the capnodynamic equation:&#xD;
ELV x [(FACO2(n)-FACO2(n-1)] = delta(n) x EPBF [CvCO2(n)] - VTCO2.</description>
