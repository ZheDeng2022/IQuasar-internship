  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are three research questions: (1) whether the Primary Care Intervention for PTSD (PCIP)&#xD;
      improves health outcomes; (2) whether and how the PCIP can be sustainably delivered via&#xD;
      telehealth; and (3) how PCIP compares to trauma focused cognitive behavioral therapy and&#xD;
      treatment as usual (TAU) participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mixed methods randomized feasibility trial of the protocol will be measured by the RE-AIM&#xD;
      framework (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) (n=45 patients and&#xD;
      their care givers). We will collect data on patient, caregiver, and clinic staff&#xD;
      participation, retention, and satisfaction (Reach and Adoption), change in hypothesized&#xD;
      treatment mechanisms and symptoms (Effectiveness), and facilitators and barriers to&#xD;
      intervention delivery and fidelity (Implementation). We will,&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the reach and adoption of the protocol by analyzing quantitative data on patient&#xD;
           and clinic staff participation, retention, and satisfaction;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Explore the effectiveness of the protocol through medical record review, quantitative&#xD;
           assessments at baseline and post-treatment, and semi-structured qualitative interviews&#xD;
           at baseline and post-treatment to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Evaluate the implementation of the screening and intervention protocol with&#xD;
           post-intervention semi-structured qualitative interviews to assess facilitators and&#xD;
           barriers to intervention delivery, quantitative fidelity scales, observation of&#xD;
           screening, and review of intervention audio recordings to assess fidelity to the&#xD;
           protocol and intervention process.&#xD;

    <description>Nine TF-CBT components exist which are summarized by the acronym &quot;PRACTICE&quot;. &quot; These components are contained within three phases that are typically provided in equal length. Three phases exist as follows:&#xD;
Phase 1: Stabilization Skills Phase 2: Trauma Narration and Processing Phase 3: Consolidation&#xD;
Conjoint child-parent sessions to enhance communication about the child's trauma experiences and general parent-child communication&#xD;
Enhancing safety and future development to address these issues. During each TF-CBT session, the therapist meets for about half of the session with the child and about half of the session with the parent or caregiver (during the conjoint sessions, most of the session is spent with the child and parent together).</description>
