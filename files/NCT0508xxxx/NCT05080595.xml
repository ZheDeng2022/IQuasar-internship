      We propose a rideshare-supported intervention that leverages a partnership with Lyft Health,&#xD;
      a HIPAA-secured logistics solution that enables us to provide reliable and efficient&#xD;
      transportation for patients. Lyft rides will be provided to patients for any&#xD;
      transplant-related medical visits, including but not limited to clinic visits with transplant&#xD;
      providers, laboratory testing, and imaging/procedural testing that need to be performed as&#xD;
      part of the routine evaluation process and prior to waitlisting for transplant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transportation barriers are often cited as barriers to healthcare access, leading to delays&#xD;
      in care, non-compliance, and lower health outcomes. We hypothesize that access to&#xD;
      transportation is a key modifiable social determinant that, if intervened upon, will lead to&#xD;
      improvements in equitable access to the liver transplant waitlist (and transplant) for&#xD;
      underserved liver transplant candidates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose a rideshare-supported intervention that leverages a partnership with Lyft Health,&#xD;
      a HIPAA-secured logistics solution that enables us to provide reliable and efficient&#xD;
      transportation for patients. Lyft rides will be provided to patients for any&#xD;
      transplant-related medical visits, including but not limited to clinic visits with transplant&#xD;
      providers, laboratory testing, and imaging/procedural testing that need to be performed as&#xD;
      part of the routine evaluation process and prior to waitlisting for transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 is to ascertain the prevalence of transportation barriers among liver transplant&#xD;
      candidates and describe the sociodemographic and clinical characteristics of this population.&#xD;
      Aim 2 is to pilot a randomized controlled trial of the needs-based app-supported&#xD;
      transportation assistance program (TAP-LT) intervention. We will also assess preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy, feasibility, patient acceptability, and cost of the intervention. We will conduct a&#xD;
      prospective observational survey study (Aim 1) and pilot randomized controlled trial (Aim 2)&#xD;
      at a single liver transplant program (Keck Liver Transplant Program at Keck Medical Center).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the interventional trial, we will have three arms (Figure 2). Participants who report&#xD;
      transportation barriers will be randomized 1:1 to either TAP-LT intervention or usual care&#xD;
      (no transportation resources or assistance provided). Additionally, participants who report a&#xD;
      reliable source of transportation will be included as a secondary control. In this pilot&#xD;
      trial, we will enroll 20 participants in each of the three arms. We anticipate initiation of&#xD;
      recruitment within 2 months of study approval, recruitment over approximately 6 months, with&#xD;
      6-12 months of intervention and follow-up with the goal of at least 90 days of follow-up&#xD;
      after the end of intervention period for all recruited participants. The target population is&#xD;
      adult liver transplant candidates who do not have a reliable source of transportation for&#xD;
      their healthcare-related visits and needs. We will include adult patients who are eligible&#xD;
      for liver transplantation and attend an initial outpatient evaluation visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the proportion of liver transplant candidates who report barriers to&#xD;
      transportation. We will compare sociodemographic and clinical characteristics stratified by&#xD;
      transportation status using Chi-square or t-test/Kruskal-Wallis as appropriate. Predictors of&#xD;
      transportation barriers will be assessed with univariate and multivariate logistic&#xD;
      regression. The primary outcome (time to listing for transplant waitlisting) will be a&#xD;
      time-to-event outcome and we will examine the effect of the TAP-LT intervention with&#xD;
      intention-to-treat Fine and Gray competing risk regression based on treatment arm. Secondary&#xD;
      outcomes will be compared using Chi-square or t-test/Kruskal-Wallis as appropriate.&#xD;
