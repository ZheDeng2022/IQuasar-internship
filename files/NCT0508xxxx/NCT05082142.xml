  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to assess if there is a significant difference in same day discharge&#xD;
      rates after Holmium Laser Enucleation of the Prostate (HoLEP). The investigators attempt to&#xD;
      perform HoLEP as a same-day discharge (SDD) procedure, but at Northwestern Memorial, the SDD&#xD;
      rate is currently approximately 60%. The limiting factor in SDD is hematuria. Tranexamic acid&#xD;
      (TXA) is a clot promoting drug that is commonly used by orthopedic, cardiac and obstetric&#xD;
      surgeons to prevent bleeding. The primary outcome will be to assess if there is a difference&#xD;
      in SDD rates in those who receive TXA vs. those who do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will assess bleeding complications (defined as unplanned ED visit/clinic&#xD;
      visit/procedure/admission related to bleeding, clot retention, clot evacuation, need for&#xD;
      perioperative transfusion) between participants who receive TXA vs. those do not. The study&#xD;
      will also assess differences in perioperative complications associated with TXA including but&#xD;
      not limited to: deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, cerebrovascular events, between&#xD;
      the groups. The study will also assess for the duration of postoperative hematuria between&#xD;
      groups as well as differences in operative times between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate that there may be up to a 25% increase in SDD rates in those who&#xD;
      receive TXA vs. those who do not.&#xD;

      On the day of the surgery, the treatment assigned to the participant will be determined by&#xD;
      chance, like flipping a coin. One arm will undergo the HoLEP procedure while receiving 1g TXA&#xD;
      IV intraoperatively. The second arm will undergo the HoLEP procedure without receiving TXA IV&#xD;
      intraoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery, participants will receive weekly surveys via text message or email asking them&#xD;
      to report any instances of difficulty urinating or blood in the urine. These surveys will&#xD;
      continue for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 days after surgery, participants will come in for a standard clinical follow up&#xD;
      appointment where they will be asked to complete a questionnaire about bleeding complications&#xD;
      and symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      12 weeks after surgery, participants will come in for their 12-week follow up and will be&#xD;
      assessed for benign prostate hyperplasia (BPH) symptoms and their urine flow rate will be&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
