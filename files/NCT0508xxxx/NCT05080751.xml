  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) is used for a group of techniques in which there is a&#xD;
      combination of a cognitive approach and a set of behavioral procedures. The basic principle&#xD;
      of CBT can be described as follows: emotional and behavioral responses, as well as&#xD;
      motivation, are not directly influenced by situations, but by the way in which these&#xD;
      situations are usually processed. The worker is any person who has a work activity,&#xD;
      regardless of being inserted in the formal or informal market. And, nightshift work, due to&#xD;
      its wide application and demand, for technical, social and economic reasons is a topic of&#xD;
      great relevance today. However, it can lead to health risks, both in biological and&#xD;
      psychological functioning, among other emotional problems, causing greater propensity to&#xD;
      stress, anxiety crisis and emotional tiredness. In the food and nutrition units, where the&#xD;
      organization of work is strongly guided by Taylorist-Fordist principles, structured based on&#xD;
      routines, technical standards and organization charts for the meals production, giving&#xD;
      attention and dedication to the behaviors and habits of employees, become some strategies for&#xD;
      maintaining and improving motivation for work and quality of life in this environment.&#xD;
      Objective: to evaluate the effects of an intervention to change eating behavior on the&#xD;
      perception of quality of life and eating habits of night workers in food and nutrition units.&#xD;
      Method: This is a research project, involving a systematic review (study I) and a clinical&#xD;
      trial (study II). The systematic review aim to investigate whether there is a difference in&#xD;
      eating behavior between workers, the one that works during the day and the other at night.&#xD;
      The second study will consist of two groups; one control and one intervention. The research&#xD;
      will consist on a web-based strategies, with two evaluative moments, before and after&#xD;
      intervention. To assess the eating behavior outcome, the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire&#xD;
      (DEBQ) will be used; for eating practices, the Self-Applicable Scale for Food Assessment will&#xD;
      be included, according to the Recommendations of the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population.&#xD;
      For analysis of quality of life, the WHOQOL-Bref, short version of the WHOQOL-100 instrument,&#xD;
      will be used.&#xD;

      The clinical trial will be a blind randomized study, in order to contemplate the objectives.&#xD;
      This study, which will be fully conducted online, the individuals surveyed (1: 1) will&#xD;
      receive, or group intervention, with behavioral cognitive strategies to change eating&#xD;
      behavior, or group intervention without the problematization proposed for the change, just&#xD;
      working on the transmission of knowledge about healthy lifestyle.The study presents two&#xD;
      evaluative moments (before and after the intervention), by filling out questionnaires, which&#xD;
      will be used to assess the change in eating behavior. Participants, by their own adherence to&#xD;
      the study, will use digital platforms for electronic questionnaires - qualtrics, and for the&#xD;
      materials, an interactive electronic mural, padlet (padlet.com). The sample will consist of&#xD;
      night workers employees (night and early morning shifts), only women, that work in food and&#xD;
      nutrition units. The recruitment of participants will take place from the invitation sent to&#xD;
      multiple food and nutrition units, in the southern region of Brazil (states of Paraná, Santa&#xD;
      Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul). Workers with less than 3 months working in the unit and on&#xD;
      the night shift will be excluded from the sample; as well as interns, under 18 and pregnant&#xD;
      women. Poorly completed or incomplete questionnaires will be also excluded from the sample.&#xD;
      To obtain a power of 80% and error α = 5%, with an estimated sample loss of 20% in a total of&#xD;
      2 groups, the minimum number for each group is 29 investigated, totaling 58 individuals. For&#xD;
      the sample calculation, the program SISA (Simple Interactive Statistical Analysis) was used.&#xD;
      A sociodemographic questionnaire; a health diagnosis questionnaire; a self-applicable scale&#xD;
      for Food Assessment; the Dutch Eating Behavior Questionnaire (DEBQ) and the WHOQOL- Bref will&#xD;
      be used in this research. Employees who accept the invitation to participate in the study&#xD;
      will receive a link to answer an online questionnaire, prepared by the Qualtrics platform.&#xD;
      This questionnaire will allow to evaluate the inclusion criteria for the research. For those&#xD;
      who not gets to participate in the study, will be invited to visit, through the indication of&#xD;
      the website and social networks of the research group (@pevspucrs), the educational&#xD;
      materials, such as e-books and planners.Those employees to be included will receive a welcome&#xD;
      message to the study, and at the same time, read and sign the Informed Consent Form (ICF),&#xD;
      which will also be available online. Reaching the required sample size, the groups will be&#xD;
      randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be per cluster (will be performed according to the workplaces of the&#xD;
      employees to be included in the study). This type of randomization strengthens the blinding&#xD;
      of research. The locations (food units) will be randomized using the Random Allocation&#xD;
      Software, version 2.0 in two groups: Control Group (CG) and Intervention Group (IG).The first&#xD;
      task for both groups, before the intervention, will be to complete those questionnaires:&#xD;
      sociodemographic questionnaire; anamnesis with anthropometric information; the&#xD;
      Self-Applicable Scale for the Assessment of Food, according to the Recommendations of the&#xD;
      Food Guide for the Brazilian Population; the Dutch Questionnaire to assess Eating Behavior&#xD;
      and the WHOQOL-Bref, to assess quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As soon as everyone is completely filled in, the intervention process will begin.The online&#xD;
      intervention it will be in asynchronous modality way. Members will self-manage activities.&#xD;
      Materials for the sessions, such as videos, presentations (canva, mentimeter), infographics&#xD;
      and icons, for sending tasks, will be available on an electronic wall (padlet).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention program materials will be available every week, during all the six (06)&#xD;
      sessions for each groups. At the end of the intervention, one week after the last session,&#xD;
      the participants completed those questionnaires again. And after three months, from the&#xD;
      second stage of filling in the instruments, the employees will answer the questionnaires&#xD;
      again, in order to verify whether the effect of the intervention has been maintained. Data&#xD;
      will be entered in the MS Excel application. The database will be imported into the&#xD;
      statistical software Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) IBM version 22.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables, for the purposes of statistical analysis, will be the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Body Mass Index: eutrophy, overweight, obesity and severe obesity;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Socioeconomic class: A, B1, B2, C1, C2 and D-E.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Self-Applicable Scale for the Assessment of Food, according to the Recommendations of&#xD;
           the Food Guide for the Brazilian Population: dimensions, such as the choice of food,&#xD;
           ways of eating, domestic organization and planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Quality of Life: quality of life domains to be assessed are: physical, psychological,&#xD;
           social relations and the environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Eating Behavior: domains through the DEBQ questionnaire to be evaluated are: restricted&#xD;
           food, emotional food and external food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome: eating behavior, which will be assessed through the Dutch Questionnaire for&#xD;
      the Assessment of Eating Behavior (DEBQ) and the assessment of eating practices, by the&#xD;
      Self-Applicable Scale for Food Assessment, according to the Recommendations of the Food Guide&#xD;
      for the Brazilian Population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome: quality of life. For the ethical aspects of the research, this study has&#xD;
      already been submitted and approved by the PUCRS research ethics committee, under the&#xD;
      registration number 44556321.5.0000.5336.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the whole study will be done online, the risks known for participating in the research are&#xD;
      attributed to some uncomfortables moments, like answering the various questionnaires, or due&#xD;
      to the time dedicated for the questions, and also due to participate in some activity, such&#xD;
      as the delivery of a task. If the participant does not feel comfortable during the&#xD;
      intervention, will be possible to stop participating at any time during the research. In&#xD;
      addition of uncomfortables moments, it is possible that the internet connections fail or show&#xD;
      a certain slowness, or that the participant will have doubts on how to save their answers. In&#xD;
      the IC, there will be guidance on how to proceed in these cases.The possible benefits of&#xD;
      participating in the research can be the diagnosis of the nutritional status, that will be&#xD;
      delivered individually, and the probable benefits already indicated in the scientific&#xD;
      literature by the change in eating behavior.&#xD;
