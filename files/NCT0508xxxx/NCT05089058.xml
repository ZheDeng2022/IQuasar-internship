  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intrusive memories are sensory memories of a traumatic event(s) that spring to mind&#xD;
      involuntarily, evoke strong emotions, and disrupt functioning in daily life. Previous&#xD;
      research has demonstrated that a brief cognitive intervention can prevent the development of&#xD;
      intrusive memories as well as reduce the number of intrusive memories of long-standing&#xD;
      trauma. Initial pilot work (using case studies) with women in Iceland indicates that the&#xD;
      intervention is acceptable and feasible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This exploratory pilot trial will compare remote delivery of the intervention (i.e. brief,&#xD;
      digitally delivered imagery-competing task intervention, n = 12) to an attention-placebo&#xD;
      control condition (i.e., brief, digitally delivered relaxation exercise task; n = 12). We&#xD;
      will explore whether (relative to the control condition) the intervention: (i) reduces the&#xD;
      number of intrusive memories (primary outcome), and (ii) improves other symptoms and&#xD;
      functioning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is funded by the OAK foundation (OCAY-18-442) and the Strategic Research and&#xD;
      Development Program: Societal Challenges in Iceland (200095-5601).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The proposed study will involve a brief intervention (c. 2 guided sessions with the&#xD;
      researcher; options for up to 6 additional booster sessions) delivered digitally and remotely&#xD;
      (i.e., not physically in-person), and with initial guided support (remotely delivered) from a&#xD;
      researcher. Participants will be asked to fill out a diary indicating the number of intrusive&#xD;
      memories they experienced, along with self-report questionnaires, at baseline (i.e., one week&#xD;
      prior to commencement of the intervention), week 1 (week after the second&#xD;
      intervention/control session), week 5 (primary outcome; 5 weeks from the second&#xD;
      intervention/control session), and at 1-, 3- and 6-months follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring will be performed by a clinical trial unit to verify that the study is conducted&#xD;
      and data are generated and documented in compliance with GCP and the applicable regulatory&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potentially eligible participants for this pilot study will be identified using data&#xD;
      collected in the SAGA cohort study (an epidemiological study of trauma among Icelandic&#xD;
      women).&#xD;

The other question is open-ended: &quot;How have the intrusive memories affected your ability to function in your daily life in the past week?&quot;). We will also explore whether there is a link between the content of participants' intrusive memories and specific domains of functioning - in open-ended discussion and using questions (asked at baseline) such as: &quot;Are there any specific activities that you would like to do, but avoid because they are linked to your intrusive memories?&quot; and (asked at follow-ups, after the intervention/control task) &quot;Since starting the study, are there any specific activities that you used to avoid (due to your intrusive memories), but now do more often?&quot;</description>
