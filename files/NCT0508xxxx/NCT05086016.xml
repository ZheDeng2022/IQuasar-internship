  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the clinical investigation is to access device performance and the initial&#xD;
      clinical safety and effectiveness of the Minima Stent in neonates, infants, and young&#xD;
      children requiring intervention for common congenital vascular stenosis (i.e., coarctation of&#xD;
      the aorta and/or pulmonary artery stenosis) who are indicated for treatment.&#xD;
