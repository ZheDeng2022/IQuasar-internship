  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to evaluate the efficacy of a brief psychoeducational intervention&#xD;
      to improve quality of life in patients with lung cancer who are transitioning from active&#xD;
      treatment to surveillance.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of a brief psychoeducational&#xD;
      intervention relative to a control condition for improving quality of life in patients with&#xD;
      lung cancer who are transitioning from treatment to surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, participants will complete survey questions and will be randomly assigned to&#xD;
      receive a 5-session program or a 1-session program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is expected that about 100 people will take part in this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The American Lung Association is supporting this research by providing funding for the&#xD;
      research study.&#xD;

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>Approximately 6 weeks after the patient's cancer treatment is complete, participants in the intervention arm will proceed to receive up to 5 study sessions (approximately weekly, ~50 minutes each) with a trained interventionist focused on psychoeducational topics. This arm was designed to enhance patient skills to address key concerns during the transition from treatment to surveillance, using a cognitive-behavioral approach. Sessions will be based on an intervention manual.</description>

    <description>At approximately 6 weeks after treatment completion (as defined by our eligibility criteria), control patients will attend one study session (~50 minutes) with a study clinician. This session is designed to control for patient access and connection to psychosocial resources as recommended in recent work.</description>
