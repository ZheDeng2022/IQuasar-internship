    <textblock>
      This study is a double-blind randomized clinical trial in Diabetic patients (type 2) over 18&#xD;
      years of age who have diabetic macular edema with involvement of the central 1 millimeter&#xD;
      (central macular thickness is more than 300 Î¼m) and BCVA 20/30 or less who visit the retina&#xD;
      clinic of Labbafinejad Hospital Are studied. (In patients with bilateral macular edema, only&#xD;
      one eye is included in the study.) Complete ocular examinations (including best corrected&#xD;
      visual acuity - anterior segment - intraocular pressure - dilated pupil funduscopy with&#xD;
      severity of diabetic retinopathy), optical coherence tomography (OCT), EDI-OCT( Enhanced&#xD;
      Depth Imaging Optical Coherence Tomography ) - as well as Optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      angiography (OCTA ) are performed for all patients at baseline. Blood tests are also taken&#xD;
      from patients for fasting blood sugar and HbA1C. Patients are then randomly divided into two&#xD;
      groups. The first group is treated with injections of 1.25 mg of intravitreal bevacizumab&#xD;
      monthly for 3 months (months 0, 1 and 2) with topical drops of Timolol twice a day and&#xD;
      Dorzolamide twice a day. For the second group (control group), 3 injections of 1.25 mg of&#xD;
      intravitreal bevacizumab monthly with artificial tears (twice a day as a placebo) are&#xD;
      prescribed. Patients in both groups are visited 1 month after the third basic intravitreal&#xD;
      bevacizumab (IVB) injection and complete ophthalmology examinations are performed and central&#xD;
      thickness of macula is recorded based on the patient's OCT as well as the need for IVB&#xD;
      re-injection. EDI (Enhanced Depth Imaging)-OCT and OCTA are performed again for all patients.&#xD;
