      Prospective, multicenter, unblinded study to evaluate outcomes of the Lapiplasty® Procedure&#xD;
      using the Lapiplasty® Mini-Incision™ System for patients in need of hallux valgus surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 200 subjects will be treated in this study at up to 20 clinical sites. Patients 14&#xD;
      years through 58 years with symptomatic hallux valgus will be eligible to participate based&#xD;
      on the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in the study protocol.&#xD;

      Prospective, multicenter, unblinded study to evaluate outcomes of the Lapiplasty® Procedure&#xD;
      using the Lapiplasty® Mini-Incision™ System for patients in need of hallux valgus surgery:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To determine radiographic recurrence of hallux valgus and the timing of failure&#xD;
           following hallux valgus correction with the Lapiplasty® Procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine whether the Lapiplasty® Procedure effectively corrects anatomical alignment&#xD;
           of the 1st metatarsal and sesamoids in all three planes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess whether early weight-bearing after the Lapiplasty® Procedure affects the union&#xD;
           rates or causes loss of 3-plane correction.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To evaluate the quality of life and pain scores following the Lapiplasty® Procedure.&#xD;
