    <textblock>
      With increased availability and use of cannabis by older adults aged ≥ 50 years, a rigorous&#xD;
      evaluation of the benefits and risks of cannabis use in these individuals is necessary. Our&#xD;
      proposed project will investigate whether older adults who initiate cannabis use after the&#xD;
      age of 50 are at an increased risk of fall and what are the underlying mechanisms. We will&#xD;
      measure motor and cognitive function in older cannabis users and nonusers and we will use&#xD;
      positron emission tomography to determine brain activity and how it is associated with fall&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The prevalence of cannabis use has increased significantly in recent years among US adults&#xD;
      aged 50 years and older. With increased availability and use of cannabis by older adults, a&#xD;
      rigorous evaluation of the benefits and risks of cannabis use in these individuals is&#xD;
      necessary. Aging is characterized by physiological and social changes that make older adults&#xD;
      vulnerable to chronic disease and geriatric conditions, including cognitive impairment and&#xD;
      falls. Unintentional falls are a common event for older adults and a major cause of morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality linked with a decline in functional status and disability. Moreover, falls and&#xD;
      cognitive impairment are a &quot;well-known couple&quot;; as older adults with moderate to severe&#xD;
      cognitive impairment have a higher risk of falls, with an annual incidence of around 60-80%,&#xD;
      which is twice the rate of cognitively normal older adults. Impaired cognitive function is an&#xD;
      effect of cannabis use, and there is increasing evidence that those effects may persist later&#xD;
      in life. Therefore, the physiological effects of chronic cannabis use may further increase&#xD;
      falls in older adults via alterations in gait and cognition. Studies have shown reduced&#xD;
      neural activity in the frontal brain networks and associations with increased fear of falling&#xD;
      in older adults. It is also known that in regular cannabis users, the effects of cannabis may&#xD;
      have an impact on cognitive-motor skills and brain mechanisms that modulate coordinated&#xD;
      movement. The goal of this application is to investigate the neural correlates of fall risk&#xD;
      and cognitive and motor function in individuals who initiate drug use after the age of 50. We&#xD;
      will use FDG-PET to determine brain activity. Fall risk and cognitive/motor function will be&#xD;
      assessed with the measures from the NIH Toolbox and a fall risk model. Our central hypothesis&#xD;
      is that older chronic cannabis users are at a higher fall risk than older non-users, which is&#xD;
      associated with reduced cerebral FDG uptake. These results are expected to provide critical&#xD;
      and timely data to the public and health professionals regarding the effects of self-directed&#xD;
      cannabis use on increased fall risk and if clinicians need to assess cannabis use when&#xD;
      determining fall risk and deciding prevention strategies.&#xD;
