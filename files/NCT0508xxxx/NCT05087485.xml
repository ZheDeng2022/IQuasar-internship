  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators hypothesize that the introduction of basic science explanations within the&#xD;
      instructional design of case-based training in visual diagnostics will improve students'&#xD;
      learning curves, retention, and retrieval of knowledge/skill following a washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a group of medical students with limited dermatological training, what is the effect of&#xD;
      integrating biomedical causal explanations of visual criteria during a prolonged case-based&#xD;
      skin cancer training program in visual pattern recognition when compared with an identical&#xD;
      instructional design without biomedical explanations? How will the displacement of students'&#xD;
      cognitive resources from practicing pattern recognition towards understanding the pattern,&#xD;
      affect their learning behavior, learning curve (accuracy and time per diagnosis), and&#xD;
      retrieval of pattern recognition skills following a washout period?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The above-mentioned research questions will be tested through a randomized trial with an&#xD;
      allocation ratio of 1:1. All participants will be trained in skin cancer diagnostics through&#xD;
      a mobile application that offers simulation training and learning through written modules&#xD;
      about the various differential diagnoses. Approximately half of the participants will be&#xD;
      subject to a written content that displays the dermoscopic visual criteria without an&#xD;
      explanation while the remaining half will be subject to the dermoscopic criteria + an&#xD;
      explanation of the underlying cause. The training program consists of 500 training cases, a&#xD;
      14 day wash-out period, and a final training session of 100 cases.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ensuring that medical students and novice physicians become good diagnosticians remains at&#xD;
      the core of medical education. For more than six decades academics and clinicians have sought&#xD;
      an understanding of the most successful diagnostic reasoning strategies and how to educate&#xD;
      future physicians in these strategies. Research has revealed that most diagnosticians apply a&#xD;
      mix of pattern recognition, deductive backward reasoning, i.e. searching for symptoms or&#xD;
      signs that justify a tentative diagnosis, and inductive forwards reasoning strategies, i.e.&#xD;
      analyzing the most probable diagnosis based on signs and symptoms. There is some evidence in&#xD;
      support of novice clinicians being more prone towards deliberate deductive and inductive&#xD;
      diagnostic reasoning strategies while experienced clinicians generally rely more on pattern&#xD;
      recognition. Unlike novices, experts generally identify the most likely diagnosis based on&#xD;
      pattern recognition, followed by deliberate and often unconscious deductive reasoning, aimed&#xD;
      at justifying or ruling out the identified tentative diagnosis/-es. The dual-process theory&#xD;
      offers an explanation for this two-step reasoning strategy, dividing human cognition into two&#xD;
      systems; the intuitive system 1 (pattern recognition) and the deliberate and analytic&#xD;
      deductive/inductive system 2. Pattern recognition (system 1) is immediate, often very&#xD;
      accurate, and requires minuscule resources although it has been criticized widely for being&#xD;
      prone to unconscious heuristic biases. The deliberate system 2 processes are slower and&#xD;
      require significantly greater cognitive resources than system 1 processes. System 2 processes&#xD;
      are generally considered less prone to unconscious biases, although several findings suggest&#xD;
      otherwise. Most people prefer to apply the efficient and non-strenuous system 1 whenever&#xD;
      possible, and only active system 2 processes when absolutely necessary. Unfortunately,&#xD;
      pattern recognition (system 1) in a diagnostic setting relies on domain-specific experience,&#xD;
      which is generally unavailable for novice physicians that therefore rely on the significantly&#xD;
      more demanding system 2 operations during diagnostics. Several authors argue that educators&#xD;
      should consider teaching or promoting pattern recognition if possible as it enables accurate,&#xD;
      efficient, and less demanding diagnostics. Realistic and extensive pattern recognition&#xD;
      training is possible within medical specialties that rely mainly on visual processing such as&#xD;
      pathology, radiology, and dermatology. Large case libraries with annotated x-rays, pathology&#xD;
      slides, or dermoscopic images can be made readily available for practice, enabling students&#xD;
      to attain strong mental representations of the relevant differential diagnoses before&#xD;
      initiating their clinical careers. There is extensive literature on how to facilitate the&#xD;
      development of strong mental representations through pattern recognition training. Although&#xD;
      identification of bone fracture types, cellular abnormalities, and skin conditions is&#xD;
      important, additional knowledge retrieval and processing is necessary in order to provide&#xD;
      patients with the correct treatment regime. Artificial intelligence and trained pigeons (yes,&#xD;
      pigeons) handle image diagnostics impressively well, with several authors reporting&#xD;
      accuracies on par with expert clinicians. However, unlike expert clinicians, machines and&#xD;
      pigeons are currently unable to retrieve one or more complex precompiled diagnosis-specific&#xD;
      scripts or schemas from long-term memory based on subtle diagnostic cues, followed by a&#xD;
      deliberate analysis of the most likely diagnosis and appropriate treatment action. Illness&#xD;
      script theory attempts to explain this incredible memory retrieval and processing operation&#xD;
      through a simple framework. Illness scripts are defined as mental representations or schemas&#xD;
      of an illness or disease that contains enabling conditions, i.e. demographics and medical&#xD;
      history, consequences, i.e. the symptoms and presentations of the illness/disease, and&#xD;
      faults, i.e. the biomedical explanation for consequences and enabling conditions. When an&#xD;
      experienced physician recognizes a certain pattern of enabling conditions, consequences, and&#xD;
      faults it activates and retrieves one or more illness scripts from long term memory,&#xD;
      unlocking all of the knowledge stored within that script, including the physiology of the&#xD;
      disease and interrelated scripts (differential diagnoses). Little is known concerning the&#xD;
      formation and consolidation of illness scripts during medical and clinical training but there&#xD;
      is increasing evidence in favor of combining the underlying physiology and anatomy (faults)&#xD;
      with demographics (enabling conditions) and symptoms (consequences) within the instructional&#xD;
      material of educational interventions in medicine. An underlying conceptual understanding of&#xD;
      the medical condition's causal mechanisms seems to help trainees consolidate and inter-link&#xD;
      their illness scripts, resulting in faster and more accurate script activation and&#xD;
      utilization. When causal mechanisms or &quot;the biomedical science&quot; is included in standard&#xD;
      instructional designs for internal medicine, containing clinical manifestation of the&#xD;
      disease, students perform significantly better, especially on delayed tests and transfer&#xD;
      tests. Similar positive effects on diagnostic performance have been observed when &quot;extended&quot;&#xD;
      basic science descriptions that explain the underlying sociological and behavioral causal&#xD;
      mechanisms are integrated within the instructional design for complex medical conditions that&#xD;
      include a combination of social, somatic, and psychological problems. Student's immediate and&#xD;
      retained diagnostic performance and transfer of knowledge improves if biomechanical visual&#xD;
      analogies of the causal mechanisms are introduced within the description of the causal&#xD;
      mechanisms. The positive effect of integrating biomedical science is best harnessed when it&#xD;
      is intermixed with classic curricula describing clinical manifestations of diseases. The&#xD;
      positive effects from classic textbook diagnostics on written cases also translate towards&#xD;
      visual diagnostics, e.g. dental radiology, and the underlying conceptual knowledge of&#xD;
      procedural skills, e.g. lumbar puncture. Integrating the causal explanations for visual&#xD;
      criteria used in visual diagnostics increases both the immediate and long-term diagnostic&#xD;
      performance of students. The improvement in diagnostic performance associated with&#xD;
      integrating biomedical science has been found to be resilient against speed-accuracy&#xD;
      tradeoffs, which indicates that a strong representation of &quot;faults&quot; within an illness script&#xD;
      increases diagnosticians' ability to rapidly and accurately activate the script. Although&#xD;
      basic science explanations seem to translate across the various medical modalities it is&#xD;
      important to note that visual diagnostics varies significantly from remaining diagnostic&#xD;
      modalities. When experienced dermatologists examine a skin lesion they immediately form a&#xD;
      global impression generating one or more tentative diagnoses that are usually very accurate.&#xD;
      Subsequently, they engage in a backward reasoning strategy attempting to find features that&#xD;
      justify or reject their tentative diagnosis. The global impression is a result of intuitive&#xD;
      system 1 operations while the deliberate analysis of differential diagnoses and feature&#xD;
      search is deliberate system 2 operations. Although experts from remaining clinical&#xD;
      specialties such as internists, neurologists, and cardiologists rely heavily on pattern&#xD;
      recognition their assessments are based on input (symptoms, medical history, laboratory&#xD;
      tests, etc.) that are gathered deliberately, requiring a larger degree of system 2 processes&#xD;
      early in the diagnostic reasoning process. Investigators theorize that this difference in the&#xD;
      &quot;point in time&quot; where pattern recognition is used by the various diagnostic specialties&#xD;
      should be reflected in the education of the various specialties. Based on these reflections,&#xD;
      the optimal educational intervention for clinicians that rely mainly on visual processing&#xD;
      (dermatology, pathology, and radiology) ought to be case-based training with direct visual&#xD;
      feedback coupled to a curriculum with a concise and relevant instructional design. The&#xD;
      formerly mentioned studies show that integrating basic science within such an instructional&#xD;
      design improves the diagnostic accuracy and transfer of knowledge to similar disease&#xD;
      categories. However, former studies in visual diagnostics have failed to establish whether&#xD;
      improved performance following the integration of basic sciences improves clinicians' pattern&#xD;
      recognition, deliberate feature search strategy, or both. The educational interventions&#xD;
      within these studies have been short and included less than 3 training cases per diagnosis,&#xD;
      which investigators of this trial consider low in regards to the formation of mental&#xD;
      representations for the visual classification of diseases (pattern recognition). Finally,&#xD;
      former studies have not examined the effect of integrating basic science within the&#xD;
      instructional design of training interventions for visual diagnostics and its effect on&#xD;
      learning behavior (total duration and the number of times accessing instructional material),&#xD;
      learning curves (formation of mental representations), and skill/knowledge retrieval.&#xD;
      Investigatorsors hypothesize that the introduction of basic science explanations within the&#xD;
      instructional design of case-based training in visual diagnostics will improve students'&#xD;
      learning curves, retention, and retrieval of knowledge/skill following a washout period. To&#xD;
      our knowledge, there are no previous studies that elaborate the effect of integrating&#xD;
      biomedical explanations for visual criteria in a prolonged case-based educational&#xD;
      intervention aimed at training students' pattern recognition skills. Acknowledging that&#xD;
      learning may differ when focusing on novice and more advanced learners and that immediate&#xD;
      performances do not always predict long-term learning outcomes, this is an important research&#xD;
      gap to fill.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a group of medical students with limited dermatological training, what is the effect of&#xD;
      integrating biomedical causal explanations of visual criteria during a prolonged case-based&#xD;
      skin cancer training program in visual pattern recognition when compared with an identical&#xD;
      instructional design without biomedical explanations? How will the displacement of students'&#xD;
      cognitive resources from practicing pattern recognition towards understanding the pattern,&#xD;
      affect their learning behavior, learning curve (accuracy and time per diagnosis), and&#xD;
      retrieval of pattern recognition skills following a washout period?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as a randomized controlled trial with an allocation ratio of 1:1.&#xD;
      Enrolled participants must be actively enrolled at the Faculty of Health and Medical&#xD;
      Sciences, University of Copenhagen, and have passed exams in basic histopathology and&#xD;
      cellular physiology. Exclusion criteria are former training in dermoscopy or skin cancer&#xD;
      diagnostics in general. A minimum of 60 students will be recruited. All participants are&#xD;
      required to download a mobile application (Dermloop) containing the educational material.&#xD;
      During sign-up participants will be asked to fill out information concerning their&#xD;
      demographics, enter a six-digit trial code and sign a digital consent. Upon registration,&#xD;
      participants will automatically be randomly allocated to the basic science or feature group.&#xD;
      During the study all participants will complete four steps (see figure):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-test&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Digital training session in skin cancer diagnostics concentrated on seven differential&#xD;
           diagnoses (nevi, melanoma, seborrheic keratoses/solar lentigo, basal cell carcinoma,&#xD;
           dermatofibromas, and vascular lesions) that span 7 days. Instructional material differs&#xD;
           between the two study groups. The basic science group will have access to modules that&#xD;
           describe the characteristic visual criteria for each diagnosis and their underlying&#xD;
           histopathological cause. The feature group will read identical descriptions of the&#xD;
           visual criteria without an explanation of the underlying causal mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retraining session&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Retention test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-test consists of 12 randomly sampled items (generalizability coefficient of 0.7) from&#xD;
      a test item library (n= 25 items) with established validity evidence for skin cancer&#xD;
      diagnostics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital training session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The session consists of an introduction and presentation of six diagnoses (nevi, melanoma,&#xD;
      seborrheic keratoses/solar lentigo, basal cell carcinoma, dermatofibromas, and vascular&#xD;
      lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction The introduction includes a short written introduction about skin cancer&#xD;
      diagnostics and the six diagnoses that will be included in the educational intervention.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to briefly read through the various dermoscopic criteria that are&#xD;
      characteristic of the seven diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Case-based practice&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to practice on 500 skin lesions within 7 days. The training&#xD;
      consists of quizzes with direct feedback. Participants will be asked to diagnose skin lesions&#xD;
      based on the age and gender of the patient, a clinical image, a dermoscopic image, and the&#xD;
      location of the skin lesion. Participants will receive immediate feedback following their&#xD;
      choice of diagnosis. The feedback consists of their diagnosis, the correct diagnosis, access&#xD;
      to the instructional design of both diagnoses, and an ability to toggle between the images&#xD;
      and location. Each quiz is 10 cases long and the distribution of diagnoses is random across&#xD;
      each quiz, but with an overall distribution across 100 cases of:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diagnosis distribution:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melanoma 20% Nevi 20% Seb. K./ Lentigo Solaris 20% Dermatofibroma 10% Basal cell carcinoma&#xD;
      10% Hemangioma 10% Squamous cell carcinoma. 10%&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retraining session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 14 day wash-out period, all participants will be asked to access the&#xD;
      application and practice on another 100 cases within two days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retention test:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seven days after the retraining session has been concluded participants will be asked to&#xD;
      answer a retention test. The retention test consists of 12 randomly sampled items&#xD;
      (generalizability coefficient of 0.7) from the same test item library (n= 25 items) used for&#xD;
      the pre-test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Slope and plateau (if reached) of the initial learning curve (accuracy and time per&#xD;
      diagnosis) Slope and plateau (if reached) of a secondary learning curve (accuracy and time&#xD;
      per diagnosis) following a washout period&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time spent reading instructional material Number of times that the instructional material has&#xD;
      been accessed Change in performance from pre-test to retention test.&#xD;
