      The SPRING project intends to develop a social assistance robot, called ARI, capable of&#xD;
      interacting with several users (patients, families) in noisy and busy hospital environments&#xD;
      to inform, guide and entertain them and to support care workers in these environments. The&#xD;
      AP-HP researchers participating in the SPRING project wish to evaluate human-robot&#xD;
      interactions in a day care hospital and in particular the acceptability and the uses of the&#xD;
      robot.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Elderly people suffering from neurocognitive disorders require multimodal support (social,&#xD;
      medical, associative) in which Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) could intervene in order to&#xD;
      improve the physical and psychological well-being of elderly people and maintain their&#xD;
      quality of life. SARs are social entities capable of interacting with their users in a&#xD;
      variety of contexts (informational, recreational, educational). These robots also offer&#xD;
      promising possibilities for accompanying care workers in their support of people with&#xD;
      neurodegenerative diseases. However, up to date, these robots are not sufficiently&#xD;
      sophisticated to engage in satisfactory social interactions with human beings and lead to&#xD;
      their adoption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The SPRING study is a non-interventional study that does not include objectives for improving&#xD;
      health or patient care. It is an exploratory study targeting five use cases with a social&#xD;
      robot and three populations of care hospital users (patients, informal or family caregivers&#xD;
      and professionals). No follow-up of the participants is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of SPRING is to study the acceptability of socially assistive robots among&#xD;
      three actors in a hospital service: patients, informal or family caregivers and&#xD;
      professionals. The secondary objectives are to study a) the usability of the ARI robot among&#xD;
      day care hospital's users which is necessary to understand the efficiency of using the robot&#xD;
      in this context; b) the organisational impact of the robot on the operation of the service&#xD;
      among day care hospital's professionals ; c) the ethical questions generated by the presence&#xD;
      of the robot with the participants that will allow us to extend our understanding of the&#xD;
      determinants of the rejection or adoption of new technologies in the hospital context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this non-interventional and exploratory research, the ARI robot will be tested in the&#xD;
      waiting room of a day care hospital in a geriatric hospital regarding five use cases&#xD;
      (1/welcoming patients and family members to the hospital, 2/ providing a reminder how to&#xD;
      follow sanitary gestures for the prevention of virus transmission, 3/providing patients an&#xD;
      assistance to prepare for the medical consultation that will follow during the day, 4/&#xD;
      providing orientation and guidance in relation to the location (hospital) and the services&#xD;
      available (toilets, cafeteria, elevators, etc.) and 5/Providing entertainment to patients and&#xD;
      families during the waiting time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and their family caregivers meet the robot only once. They answer questionnaires and&#xD;
      participate in semi-structured interviews after interacting with the robot. Evaluations&#xD;
      target the acceptability, usability and ethical issues raised by the presence of a robotic&#xD;
      agent in support of care teams.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The professionals included in the study meet the robot several times according to their&#xD;
      professional obligations (hospital practitioners are not present every day at the day care&#xD;
      hospital and can choose when to interact with the robot). They will be invited to participate&#xD;
      in two focus groups, one before the introduction of the robot and the other one at the end of&#xD;
      the study. At the end of the study, the investigators will offer them to fill in&#xD;
      questionnaires and participate in semi-structured interviews. The evaluations proposed to the&#xD;
      professionals deal with questions of acceptability, usability, organisational impact of the&#xD;
      robot's presence, and ethical issues related to its presence in the day care hospital.&#xD;

        The population includes the 3 categories of actors attending the day care hospital:&#xD;
        patients, their carers (family or close carers) and professionals. The investigators will&#xD;
        consider all the actors who are likely to interact with the ARI social robot, including&#xD;
        people who are not formally part of the patients' care pathway, but whose presence is&#xD;
        important to their care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The individuals included will have various profiles, from a demographic, sociological and&#xD;
        clinical point of view. The patients and their carers mainly live in the Paris region.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients mainly consult the day care hospital for memory problems, but are likely to&#xD;
        display associated cognitive, behavioural or physical problems.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>The robot will process audio-visual data, using object, body and face localisation technologies as well as multi-microphone sound localisation to track objects and people and map the dynamics of its environment. The robot will also analyse facial features in order to decipher the emotional states of participants and trigger appropriate behaviour. However, the robot will not perform any profiling as defined by General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR): it will not process the data it collects in order to individualise or categorise a person. Furthermore, the robot's memory will be erased every night.</ipd_description>
