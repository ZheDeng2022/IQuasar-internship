      The treatment of systemic mastocytosis has two main axes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control of mast cell activation symptoms and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The control of proliferation (accumulation) of mast cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no standard treatment and no treatment has a marketing authorization for the&#xD;
      treatment of monoclonal indolent mastocytosis.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Mastocytosis is an orphan disease related to the accumulation and / or the proliferation of&#xD;
      abnormal mast cells in different tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In adults, a classic distinction is made between isolated cutaneous forms (10 to 15%) and&#xD;
      systemic forms (85 to 90%).&#xD;
