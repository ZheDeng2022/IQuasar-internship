  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Even when treated with methadone or buprenorphine maintenance, many people with opioid use&#xD;
      disorder (OUD) continue to experience craving. Among both users of heroin and users of&#xD;
      prescription opioids, mounting evidence shows that craving predicts return to use and&#xD;
      undermines existing treatments for OUD, thus, the development of new interventions to reduce&#xD;
      craving is a priority for addressing the opioid crisis (NIH HEAL Initiative Research Plan,&#xD;
      2019). Deficits in executive functioning, particularly working memory, are a central&#xD;
      mechanism that undermines the ability to inhibit craving. Laboratory studies in non-clinical&#xD;
      samples show that engaging in working memory tasks before or during a craving induction&#xD;
      increases the ability to resist craving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This suggests that people with OUD may benefit from engaging in working memory tasks at the&#xD;
      specific moment when craving occurs. Although previous research shows that working memory&#xD;
      &quot;training&quot; does not improve clinical outcomes in OUD, these studies have not delivered&#xD;
      training at the moment that craving actually occurs in daily life. Thus, engaging in working&#xD;
      memory tasks at the moment that craving occurs could presumably help individuals with OUD to&#xD;
      manage this persistent symptom, but this has not been tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further, studies using Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) methods show that people with&#xD;
      OUD can accurately track moment-to-moment fluctuations in craving in their daily lives,&#xD;
      suggesting that it may be feasible to deliver interventions for craving in the moment when&#xD;
      craving is reported. This study will test the efficacy of embedding a mobile cognitive&#xD;
      intervention into an EMA design in people with OUD. Using the NIH Stage Model of Intervention&#xD;
      Development, Stage 1A of this project will optimize a working memory intervention based on&#xD;
      iterative feedback from a sample of people with OUD (n = 20), in preparation for a Stage 1B&#xD;
      trial using a randomized design. In this trial, participants with OUDs (n = 60) will complete&#xD;
      a two-week EMA study in which they complete smartphone-based assessments of craving five&#xD;
      times daily. When craving is reported, a mobile application containing the working memory&#xD;
      intervention will activate. Half of the participants will complete the intervention, while&#xD;
      half will complete a control task. At the conclusion of the trial, participants will be&#xD;
      granted unrestricted access to the intervention during a feasibility phase. Outcomes include&#xD;
      change in momentary craving, change in working memory performance, and feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability, including use of the intervention during follow-up. Substance use will also be&#xD;
      assessed. This project supports the applicant's goal of leveraging cognitive mechanisms to&#xD;
      conduct treatment development research for OUD. The applicant will receive training in the&#xD;
      etiology and treatment of OUD, craving, mobile intervention development and human-centered&#xD;
      design of interventions, and analysis of intensive longitudinal data. With its emphasis on&#xD;
      modifying cognitive processes at the moment of craving, using mobile devices in patients'&#xD;
      daily lives, this project has the potential to reveal new pathways for addressing a&#xD;
      significant predictor of relapse in OUD.&#xD;
