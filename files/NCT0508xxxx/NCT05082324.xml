  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Physical inactivity is the leading cause of preventable death in developed countries, ahead&#xD;
      of smoking. It is responsible for 5.3 million (9%) of the 57 million deaths worldwide in 2008&#xD;
      and 10% of deaths in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Encouraging regular physical activity in the general population is a public health priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cardiorespiratory capacity, measured during an exercise test, expressed as maximal oxygen&#xD;
      consumption (VO2 max) or Metabolic Equivalent Task (MET) = oxygen consumption at rest [3.5&#xD;
      ml/kg/min], is an excellent indicator of individual exercise capacity and is increased by&#xD;
      regular physical activity (PA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Any gain in cardiorespiratory capacity of 1 MET is accompanied by a 12% reduction in&#xD;
      mortality whether the subjects are free of any cardiovascular pathology or have a chronic&#xD;
      pathology, regardless of their age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As physical activity is an integral part of the management of many diseases, it seems&#xD;
      essential to evaluate specific protocols oriented towards the maintenance or development of&#xD;
      strength or endurance, or even mixed protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PAPS 53 (Physical Activity and Health Pathway), set up in Mayenne, responds to the demand&#xD;
      for prescription of adapted physical activity. It is a 3-month program with 2 one-hour sports&#xD;
      sessions per week (30 minutes of endurance and 30 minutes of muscle strengthening).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The National Sport and Health Strategy 2019-2024 expert group recommends better defining the&#xD;
      characteristics of physical activity (intensity, frequency, etc.) to determine the effect&#xD;
      (dose-response) on different at-risk populations and according to the type of pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators proposed to study by comparison the VO2 max values obtained during the two&#xD;
      exercise tests (at inclusion and after 3 months of physical activity program). The hypothesis&#xD;
      is that, after completion of the PAPS program, the VO2 max value of a patient will be&#xD;
      significantly increased.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group is represented by the patients who have not yet followed the adapted&#xD;
      physical activity program. The intervention group is therefore composed of the same patients.&#xD;
      The aim is to compare the same group of eligible patients, before and after having followed&#xD;
      the &quot;PAPS 53&quot; protocol&#xD;
