  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postpartum haemorrhage (PPH) remains an important cause of maternal morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      and it accounts for approximately 25% of all deaths worldwide. Drugs such as oxytocin,&#xD;
      carbetocin, misoprostol, prostaglandin F2a and methylergonovine have been tested for bleeding&#xD;
      control during and after cesarean section. Oxytocin is the most widely used agent for the&#xD;
      prevention of postpartum hemorrhage.The primary aim of this study is to reduce the mean blood&#xD;
      loss during cesarean section.In this study, we planned to compare perop and postoperative&#xD;
      blood loss levels by giving oxytocin alone to the 1st group, oxytocin and intrauterine&#xD;
      misoprostol to the 2nd group, and carbetocin to the 3rd group of patients who were randomly&#xD;
      divided into 3 groups.In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy of oxytocin,&#xD;
      misoprostol and carbetocin in preventing uterine blood loss during cesarean section.&#xD;

      Our prospective, randomized controlled study was conducted at the Department of Obstetrics&#xD;
      and Gynecology of Bezmialem University Hospital between July and November 2021. The study&#xD;
      protocol was approved by the Ethical Committee of the Medical Faculty of Bezmialem&#xD;
      University. Written informed consent was obtained from all patients. We included a total of&#xD;
      156 women between 18 and 40 years of age who underwent a primary CS or old 1 CS under spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia at term single pregnancy with an American Society of Anesthesiology physical&#xD;
      status of I or II. This trial was designed and reported according to the Consolidated&#xD;
      Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients included in this study were randomly divided into three groups by random&#xD;
      allocation using a computer-generated random number. Group I: Oxytocin(Synpitan forte®; Deva&#xD;
      Pharma, Istanbul, Turkey) (n = 52 )( the oxytocin infusion consisting of 20 IU dissolved in&#xD;
      500 mL of normal 0.9 % sodium chloride solution and infused at a rate of 125 mL/h was&#xD;
      administered immediately after clamping the umbilical cord). Group II: (n =52) oxytocin plus&#xD;
      intrauterine misoprostol (Synpitan forte®; Deva Pharma, Istanbul, Turkey) (the oxytocin&#xD;
      infusion was administered immediately after clamping the umbilical cord and misoprostol&#xD;
      tablet (400 mg) was placed into uterine cavity at the fundus after delivery of the placenta&#xD;
      and swabbing the cavity. Group III: (n =52) 100-mg carbetocin (Synpitan forte®; Deva Pharma,&#xD;
      Istanbul, Turkey) was intravenously administered immediately after birth of the baby. All&#xD;
      surgeries were performed by the same team of two surgeons.. The collected data were age,&#xD;
      prepregnancy body mass index (BMI), gravida, parity, indication of CS, gestational age at&#xD;
      birth, Apgar scores at 1 and 5 min, birth weight, neonatal intensive care unit (NICU)&#xD;
      admission, the preoperative hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations, the change in the&#xD;
      hemoglobin and hematocrit concentrations (difference between preoperative and postoperative&#xD;
      levels), operating time, intraoperative blood loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to compare the efficacy of oxytocin, misoprostol and carbetocin in&#xD;
      preventing uterine blood loss during cesarean section.&#xD;
