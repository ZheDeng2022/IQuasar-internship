  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted to assess the efficacy, pharmacodynamic (PD), safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and immunogenicity of RGB -14- P compared to US-licensed Prolia® in&#xD;
      participants with postmenopausal osteoporosis, in a comparative manner.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double-blind, multicentre, multiple fixed-dose, 2-arm parallel-group&#xD;
      study that includes 2 periods as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Main period (52 weeks), consists of Treatment Period 1 (26 weeks) and Treatment Period 2&#xD;
           (26 weeks). On Day 1 of Treatment Period 1, prior to dosing, participants will be&#xD;
           randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive either RGB-14-P or Prolia®.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Transition Period: consists of Treatment Period 3 (26 weeks). On Day 1 of Treatment&#xD;
           Period 3 (Week 52), a subset of participants who received Prolia® during the Main Period&#xD;
           will be re-randomized 1:1 to receive either a dose RGB-14-P or Prolia® in a&#xD;
           double-blinded manner. A subset of participants continuing in the Transition Period who&#xD;
           received RGB-14-P during the Main Period will continue to receive a dose of RGB-14- P&#xD;
           but will also follow the randomization procedure to maintain blinding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the study drugs on 2 occasions (Weeks 0 and 26), on Day 1 of&#xD;
      Treatment Periods 1 and 2. Participants continuing to the Transition Period will receive the&#xD;
      study drugs on a third-occasion (Week 52), Day 1 of Treatment Period 3. One Treatment Period&#xD;
      will take 6 months (26 weeks, 183 days).&#xD;
