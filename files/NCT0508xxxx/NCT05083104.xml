      At the beginning of 2020, coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) was declared a pandemic of&#xD;
      international concern and an unprecedented challenge for country-specific health care&#xD;
      systems. The clinical feature of the disease is very wide and ranges from minor unspecified&#xD;
      symptoms (such as fever, dry cough, and diarrhea) to severe pneumonia, lung insufficiency,&#xD;
      and death. Fall in respiratory insufficiency needing mechanical ventilation, or in multiple&#xD;
      organ failure occurs in 5% of the infected patients, mainly according to age and&#xD;
      comorbidities. Coronaviruses are important pathogens in humans that can cause diseases&#xD;
      ranging from the common cold to more severe and even fatal respiratory infections. Since the&#xD;
      outbreak of the novel COVID-19 caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2&#xD;
      (SARS-CoV-2) in December 2019 in Wuhan, China, more than 2 million cases have been diagnosed&#xD;
      globally to date and the number is still growing rapidly . Patients infected with COVID-19&#xD;
      develop from mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia&#xD;
      associated with multi-organ failure .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the people who contracted COVID-19 presented with mild symptoms (80.9%), then severe&#xD;
      (13.8%), and finally critical (4.7%). Most of the confirmed cases were between the ages of 30&#xD;
      and 70 (86.6%), diagnosed in Hubei (74.7%), with an overall fatality rate of 2.3%, and 0.3%&#xD;
      in health workers. The case fatality rate for critical cases was 49.0%. Patients with&#xD;
      underlying diseases had much higher fatality rates than patients with no underlying diseases&#xD;
      (10.5% for cardiovascular disease, 7.3% for diabetes, 6.3% for chronic respiratory disease,&#xD;
      6.0% for hypertension, 5.6% for cancer, and 0.9% for none).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In clinical practice, coagulation dysfunction is commonly found in COVID-19 patients, and the&#xD;
      symptoms range from mild disorders of coagulation indicators to disseminated intravascular&#xD;
      coagulation (DIC). The exact etiology of COVID-19-associated coagulopathy is unclear, diverse&#xD;
      and multifactorial, and may include direct attack by the SARS-CoV-2 on vascular endothelial&#xD;
      cells, cytokine storm-mediated inflammation-coagulation cascades, hypoxia, and complication&#xD;
      with sepsis. Coagulation dysfunction or thrombocytopenia is closely associated with the&#xD;
      severity and poor prognosis in COVID-19 patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, coagulopathy was reported widely present in severe SARS-CoV-2 infected patients,&#xD;
      and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) developed in the majority of non-survivors .&#xD;
      In particular, COVID-19 has been shown to exert significant effects on the hematopoietic&#xD;
      system and hemostasis . Studies have emphasized that patients diagnosed with COVID-19 are&#xD;
      susceptible to hypercoagulation and thrombotic events. Microvascular thrombosis has been&#xD;
      observed in autopsies performed on patients .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent observations suggest that respiratory failure in coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID 19)&#xD;
      infections are not caused by the development of the acute respiratory distress syndrome&#xD;
      (ARDS) alone, but that microvascular thrombotic processes may contribute, also. One of the&#xD;
      most significant poor prognostic signs in those patients is the development of coagulopathy .&#xD;
