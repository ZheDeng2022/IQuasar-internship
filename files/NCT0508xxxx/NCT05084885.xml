  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This application involves a multi-stage study with the ultimate goal of developing an online&#xD;
      treatment service for problem gamblers. We will recruit up to 100 problem gamblers, and offer&#xD;
      problem gambling treatment services to them entirely over the internet. The program will be&#xD;
      evaluated based on uptake, experience of the participants, and pre-test vs post-test&#xD;
      differences in gambling and well-being.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Disordered gambling is now recognized as a behavioral addiction. Although the physical&#xD;
      consequences of the disorder are very mild, the financial and emotional costs can be&#xD;
      enormous. This application involves a multi-stage study with the ultimate goal of developing&#xD;
      an online treatment service for problem gamblers. This project was originally designed to&#xD;
      take place over a three-year period but has been condensed into two. Part one was scoping&#xD;
      review, which does not require REB approval. Part two involved focus groups with service&#xD;
      providers and people experiencing gambling problems. Part three will gather some general&#xD;
      population information by including questions of the OSDHUS and CAMH monitor. Part four&#xD;
      Involved key informant interviews, and part five would be the development and evaluation of a&#xD;
      pilot online treatment service. This application deals with part five of the overall project,&#xD;
      Parts two and four were conducted as 025-2017. In this study, we will recruit up to 100&#xD;
      problem gamblers, and offer problem gambling treatment services to them entirely over the&#xD;
      internet. The program will be evaluated based on uptake, experience of the participants, and&#xD;
      pre-test vs post-test differences in gambling and well-being.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in Gambling frequency as measured by self reported frequency on 12 different types of gambling.</measure>
    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Level of gambling frequency measured using self reported frequency on 12 types of gambling. Lower levels of gambling frequency after 12 months would be a positive outcome. We will focus on the most frequent game play out of the 12. The range is from 0 (none) to 7 (everyday) with higher numbers indicating more frequent gambling.</description>

    <time_frame>Change from baseline to 3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Gambling problems are measured using PGSI (Ferris &amp; Wynne, 2001). Each of the 9 item is measured on a 4 point scale from never (0) to almost alwasys (3). The total ranges from 0 to 27. Higher scores indicate more gambling problems; Lower scores at followup would be a positive outcome. Total scores form 3 to 7 indicate moderate gambling problems; scores 7 or higher indicate severe gambling problems.&#xD;
