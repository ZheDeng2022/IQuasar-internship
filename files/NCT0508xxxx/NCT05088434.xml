      The double-blinded placebo-controlled study compares the effect of fecal microbiota&#xD;
      transplantation vs. Anaerobically Cultivated Human Intestinal Microbiota (ACHIM) or placebo&#xD;
      (own feces) on manipulating the gut microbiota in patients with diarrhea-predominant&#xD;
      irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Fecal transplantation (FMT), the infusion of a fecal preparation from a healthy donor into&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract of another human being is capable of altering the gut microbiome&#xD;
      of the new host. There is speculation that human faeces from a healthy donor may constitute&#xD;
      the ideal &quot;probiotic&quot;, thus suggesting FMT as a treatment option for conditions where an&#xD;
      altered microbiota has been detected, including irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) .&#xD;
      Anaerobically Cultivated Human Intestinal Microbiota (ACHIM) is an alternative way to&#xD;
      manipulate gut microbiota instead of FMT. ACHIM suspension is a natural ecosystem of normal&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria cultivated and propagated regularly in the laboratory (in vitro). After&#xD;
      20 years of cultivation ACHIM has retained the same rich biodiversity as the original stool&#xD;
      sample, originating from a healthy donor in 1995. ACHIM can restore the ecological balance of&#xD;
      the gut when it has been disturbed (dysbiosis) e.g. after antibiotic treatment. ACHIM has&#xD;
      until now been given to over 400 patients (most of them suffering from recurrent Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile infection) without any serious side effects being observed. Microbiological tests&#xD;
      have shown that ACHIM is a well-balanced functional microbiota, and contains the major&#xD;
      bacterial phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Actinobacteria .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, in the present study aims at comparing these methods safety and efficacy in relieving&#xD;
      symptoms in patients with IBS. Given the ethical concerns of unknown and long-term adverse&#xD;
      effects of FMT therapy, only patients with moderate to severe symptoms will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of this open pilot study was to compare these two gut manipulating methods&#xD;
      (FMT and ACHIM) in IBS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aims were as follows;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate and to compare the safety and efficacy of FMT and ACHIM suspension in&#xD;
           relieving symptoms in patients with IBS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate and to compare the FMT and ACHIM on quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the detailed characterisation of microbial community composition (by means of&#xD;
           16S rRNA profiling) and determination of the kinetics of changes following FMT and ACHIM&#xD;
           vs. placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Participants and sample size In a blind study, patients who meet the Rome III&#xD;
      criteria for IBS with moderate to severe abdominal symptoms will be included. The patients&#xD;
      will be randomised in three groups for receiving either FMT, ACHIM suspension or placebo (own&#xD;
      feces), and they will be followed for 12 weeks with regard to efficacy and safety parameters,&#xD;
      as well as analysis of faecal samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donor screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Donors of fecal flora are healthy individuals living in the same household as the patients.&#xD;
      All donors are screened before donation for previous exposure to contagious infectious&#xD;
      agents. Screening of blood included serologic testing for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis&#xD;
      C, HIV, Epstein-Barr virus and cytomegalovirus. All donor stool samples are cultured for&#xD;
      enteric bacterial pathogens and screened for viruses and parasites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures Suspension of fresh feces from a close family member for FMT or ACHIM will&#xD;
      be instilled into the duodenum via an endoscope. This route of administration has been safe&#xD;
      in all studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Faeces transplantation protocol: Fresh stool samples are obtained immediately before&#xD;
           FMT. 60 ml of sterile 0.9% N-saline are added to a stool specimen with a weight of ~30 g&#xD;
           and homogenized manually. Screened from the patients' view, 40 ml of faeces-suspension&#xD;
           are instilled through the work channel of a gastroscope into the lower part of the&#xD;
           duodenum, and thereafter flushed with 60 ml of sterile 0.9% N-saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ACHIM transplantation protocol: The ACHIM suspension (ACHIM Biotherapeutics, Sweden) is&#xD;
           given through the work channel of a gastroscope into the lower part of duodenum, and&#xD;
           thereafter flushed with 60 ml of sterile 0.9% N-saline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool samples will be collected twice before study (week - 4 and -0-1), then after week&#xD;
           1, 4 and 12 and after 6 months. Donor feces for FMT will also be collected. Fresh frozen&#xD;
           dry stool is sampled at all time points, aliquoted and stored at -80 degrees (&lt;24 hours&#xD;
           from production to delivery).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Microbial DNA analyses: Microbiota analysis was performed using the Genetic Analysis&#xD;
           (GA) mapâ„¢ DysbiosisTest (Genetic Analysis AS, Oslo, Norway). The GA-test is based on&#xD;
           regular molecular biology techniques, comprising fecal sample homogenization and&#xD;
           mechanical bacterial cell disruption; combined with chemical cell lysis; automated total&#xD;
           bacterial genomic DNA extraction using magnetic beads; 16S ribosomal ribonucleic acid&#xD;
           (rRNA) polymerase chain reaction (PCR) DNA amplification covering the variable regions&#xD;
           V3-V9; probe labelling by single nucleotide extension; hybridisation to complementary&#xD;
           probes coupled to magnetic beads; and signal detection using BioCode 1000A 128-Plex&#xD;
           Analyzer (Applied BioCode, Santa Fe Springs, California, USA). A Dysbiosis Index (DI)&#xD;
           above 2 (maximum 5) indicate a microbiota that differs from the reference group (DI 1-2:&#xD;
           non-dysbiosis, DI 3: moderate, DI 4-5: severe dysbiosis).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood samples (Complete blood count, kidney and liver function tests) and urine&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Symptom and quality of life assessment: Gastrointestinal symptoms, bowel habits and&#xD;
           quality of life will be recorded during a 12 week follow up period, at day 0, weeks 1,&#xD;
           4, 12 and 28 for symptom and quality of life assessment. The patients are asked to&#xD;
           report the severity of global IBS symptoms and each of the symptoms (diarrhoea,&#xD;
           bloating, flatulence and pain) during the preceding week, using a four-point scale (0 =&#xD;
           none, 1 = mild, 2 = moderate, 3 = severe). IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) contains&#xD;
           5 questions that are rated on a 100-point visual analogue scale (VAS) (the severity of&#xD;
           abdominal pain, the frequency of abdominal pain, the severity of abdominal distension,&#xD;
           dissatisfaction with bowel habits, and interference with quality of life). The score&#xD;
           ranging is from 0 to 500, with a higher score indicating the worse condition (scores &lt;&#xD;
           175 represent mild IBS symptoms, 175 - 300 represents moderate severity, &gt; 300 represent&#xD;
           severe IBS). A decrease of 50 points on the IBS-SSS has been shown to correlate with&#xD;
           improvement in clinical symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short form of Nepean Dyspepsia Index (SF-NDI) will be used to evaluate quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal analysis of microbiota composition will be performed with repeated measures&#xD;
      ANOVA (for alpha diversity and bacterial abundances). If non-normal data, arcsine square root&#xD;
      transformation or a nonparametric test will be used. Original donor and recipient stool&#xD;
      microbiota will be compared (measures of alpha diversity and abundances of taxa) at baseline&#xD;
      and at each recipient stool sampling time point using nonparametric or parametric methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long experience has been gained during the past years at Haukeland University Hospital in&#xD;
      performing FMT for treatment-resistant Cl. difficile enterocolitis and have developed an&#xD;
      extensive program for identifying safe donors of faeces for FMT. Over the years, no serious&#xD;
      side effects have occurred. The subset of IBS patients who are eligible for the study are&#xD;
      typically patients with a heavy symptom burden, with few treatment alternatives. Therefore,&#xD;
      the balance of safety concerns versus possibility of symptom improvement is considered to be&#xD;
      positive, and will stress the importance of collecting safety data on FMT and ACHIM before&#xD;
      this treatment is becoming more widely used.&#xD;
