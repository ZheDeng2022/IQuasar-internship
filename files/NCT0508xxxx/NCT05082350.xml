  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A controlled clinical intervention study is proposed to determine the effect of black garlic&#xD;
      consumption on biomarkers of cardiovascular function and associated pathologies in a healthy&#xD;
      population at risk for cardiovascular disease. Black garlic is the result of a fermentation&#xD;
      process of common white garlic in which the temperature and humidity are kept constant over a&#xD;
      long period of time. Black garlic is particularly rich in phenolic compounds such as&#xD;
      S-allylcysteine or S-allyl-mercaptocysteine, with antioxidant action. It also provides&#xD;
      vitamin C and other valuable antioxidant substances such as flavonoids.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A parallel, controlled clinical trial will be performed to assess the effect of garlic on&#xD;
      mild hypercholesterolemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will conducted in two groups of volunteer: healthy and at cardiovascular risk&#xD;
      (hypercholesterolemic subjects), consuming black garlic, with each individual acting as its&#xD;
      own control. The study will have a total duration of 18 weeks, divided in two stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 1: basal or washout stage of 2 weeks, in which volunteer follow their usual diet&#xD;
           with restrictions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stage 2: intervention stage of 16 weeks, in which volunteer consume black garlic Sixty&#xD;
           healthy volunteers (men and women) between 40-65 years old and BMI between 24.9-29.9&#xD;
           kg/m2 will be recruited. From the total of volunteer, 30 will correspond to the Healthy&#xD;
           Group, which should have total blood cholesterol levels less than 200 mg/dL and&#xD;
           LDL-cholesterol less than 135 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other 30 volunteers correspond to the Cardiovascular Risk Group, which should have total&#xD;
      cholesterol levels between 200-300 mg/dL and LDL-cholesterol levels between 135-175 mg/dL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other inclusion criteria established for all volunteers are: no acute or chronic pathology,&#xD;
      (except hypercholesterolemia for the risk group), no taking drugs, hormones or dietary&#xD;
      supplements, no smoking, no pregnancy, no vegetarianism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has been approved by the Ethical Committee of Catholic University of Murcia (UCAM)&#xD;
      and will be carried out in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of Human Studies.&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place at various Health Centers and at UCAM. All participants will be&#xD;
      informed on the characteristics of the study and, after signing the informed consent, a&#xD;
      routine analysis will be requested to classify the volunteer in the healthy or cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid bias due to gender, the number of women and men recruited in both groups will be&#xD;
      balanced. The size of the study population has been estimated taking total blood cholesterol&#xD;
      level as the main variable and taking into account that the study design is randomized and&#xD;
      parallel. Considering a statistical power of 80%, a statistical significance level of 5% (one&#xD;
      tail), a standard deviation of 6.5, aiming to estimate a difference of 2.5, the number of&#xD;
      volunteers required is 25 for each group, rising to 30 in anticipation of dropouts. This&#xD;
      number, being two study groups, will allow obtaining results with statistical significance in&#xD;
      other biochemical parameters that would be determined as secondary variables of the study and&#xD;
      that would inform on the effect of black garlic consumption on cardiovascular function and&#xD;
      associated dysfunctions (inflammation, hypertension, endothelial function, diabetes, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After an initial washout (basal) stage common to all groups, in which the volunteers will&#xD;
      consume their usual diet with restriction in the consumption of fresh garlic and garlic&#xD;
      products, the intervention will start, with the consumption of black garlic for 12 weeks.&#xD;
      Volunteers will be provided with black garlic and they will ensure that no other type of&#xD;
      garlic or culinary seasoning is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary and physical activity questionnaire according to the &quot;Global Physical Activity&#xD;
      Questionnarie (GPAQ)&quot; will be compiled in order to collect information on habits and&#xD;
      lifestyle, as well as to ensure the compliance of food restrictions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, visits will be scheduled on the first day and last day of each stage. The&#xD;
      subjects will come to the Unit on fasting conditions and will provide the first morning&#xD;
      urine. Blood sample will be taken, plasma aliquoted and stored at -80°C until analysis.&#xD;
