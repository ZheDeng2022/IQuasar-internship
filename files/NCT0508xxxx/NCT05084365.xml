  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Parkinson's disease (PD) is a second common neurodegenerative disease. More than 6 million&#xD;
      individuals worldwide have Parkinson disease. No disease-modifying pharmacologic treatments&#xD;
      are available. Current medical treatment is symptomatic, focused on improvement in motor (eg,&#xD;
      tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia) and nonmotor (eg, constipation, cognition, mood, sleep) signs&#xD;
      and symptoms. Accumulating evidence suggests the important role for inflammation and&#xD;
      oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of PD. Sulforaphane extracted from broccoli sprout is an&#xD;
      agent with potent anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. Previous studies suggested&#xD;
      sulforaphane is useful in dopaminergic neuron survival. In this study, the investigator&#xD;
      attempts to evaluate the efficacy and safety of sulforaphane in PD patients.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will recruit 100 PD patients, and then these patients will be randomized to&#xD;
      sulforaphane group or placebo group (50 patients per arm) for 24 weeks clinic trial.&#xD;
      Participants will receive 24 weeks of either sulforaphane or placebo per day, in addition to&#xD;
      the existing treatment. Baseline assessments include demographics, a comprehensive medical&#xD;
      history, anthropometric measurements (weight and height), physical examination, and lab work.&#xD;
      The motor symptoms and cognitive function will be assessed by the Unified Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
      Rating Scale (UPDRS) and MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery #MCCB#, respectively, at&#xD;
      baseline, week 12 and week 24. The cranial MRI is examined at baseline and repeated at week&#xD;
      24. The primary outcomes will be the cognitive function improvement. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      include motor symptoms, biological data, MRI, safety and tolerability. During the study&#xD;
      period, safety index including blood routine, liver and kidney function and adverse reactions&#xD;
      report will be recorded.&#xD;
