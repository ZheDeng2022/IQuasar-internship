  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multi-site, randomized pragmatic trial being conducted at three diverse&#xD;
      sites. The study, called the Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START), will evaluate&#xD;
      whether a collaborative care team increases the use of two interventions-medication for&#xD;
      opioid use disorder (MOUD), and opioid use disorder (OUD) focused discharge planning-among&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with OUD, and improves linkage to follow-up care relative to usual&#xD;
      care. The START consists of an addiction medicine specialist and a care manager who will use&#xD;
      evidence-based tools to decrease barriers to MOUD and engage patients with post-discharge OUD&#xD;
      care. A total of 414 patients will be randomized from Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los&#xD;
      Angeles, the University of New Mexico Hospital in Albuquerque, and Baystate Health in&#xD;
      Springfield, Massachusetts to receive either START or usual care, stratifying by prior MOUD&#xD;
      exposure and site.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the past decade, hospitalizations for OUD nearly doubled. Patients admitted to the&#xD;
      hospital with an underlying OUD rarely receive evidence-based treatment for OUD while&#xD;
      hospitalized. MOUD is not commonly initiated in the hospital, and patients are seldom linked&#xD;
      to outpatient treatment after discharge. Hospitalized patients with OUD who do not initiate&#xD;
      MOUD or receive linkage to post-discharge treatment are at high-risk of continued misuse,&#xD;
      delays in care, future overdose and costly readmission. This study identifies the inpatient&#xD;
      hospital stay as a key opportunity to initiate MOUD and link patients with follow-up care for&#xD;
      OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Substance Use Treatment and Recovery Team (START) is an intervention that adapts the&#xD;
      principles of collaborative care to the hospital setting. Prior studies have demonstrated the&#xD;
      effectiveness of collaborative care in outpatient settings for patients with opioid and&#xD;
      alcohol use disorders, and a series of reports have demonstrated the feasibility and&#xD;
      potential efficacy of hospital based consultative teams for substance use disorders. START&#xD;
      uses team based, multi-faceted interventions (ie: motivational interviewing, medication&#xD;
      treatment, OUD-focused discharge planning), measurement-based care, and patient registries to&#xD;
      increase delivery of evidence-based care. The goal of START is to facilitate initiation of&#xD;
      MOUD during the inpatient stay and link patients to appropriate post-discharge care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The START study is a multi-site, randomized trial that will evaluate the intervention&#xD;
      improves MOUD initiation and linkage to follow-up care among hospitalized patients with OUD.&#xD;
      A total of 414 patients will be randomized from three geographically diverse hospitals&#xD;
      (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, the University of New Mexico Hospital in&#xD;
      Albuquerque, and Baystate Health in Springfield, Massachusetts) to receive either START or&#xD;
      usual care, stratifying by prior MOUD exposure and site. The study builds on a pilot&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial conducted at Cedars-Sinai by testing the intervention at three&#xD;
      geographically distinct locations, thus increasing generalizability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the aims of the research are achieved, the investigators will learn whether this model of&#xD;
      care increases OUD treatment delivery in general medical hospitals, and decreases the&#xD;
      downstream effects of untreated OUD. If effective, this translational model also can be used&#xD;
      to increase uptake of evidence-based practices for other substance use and behavioral health&#xD;
      disorders.&#xD;
