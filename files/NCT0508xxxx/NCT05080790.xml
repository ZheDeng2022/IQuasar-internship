      Dinutuximab beta was designed to bind to neuroblastoma cells and other cancer cells that&#xD;
      express the GD2 antigen, such as STS/LMS cells, and it is believed that this binding &quot;labels&quot;&#xD;
      the cells an makes them a better target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, γδ T cells can safely be expanded in-vivo using intravenous zoledronic acid and&#xD;
      subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients with different types of solid tumors [Dieli et&#xD;
      al., 2007; Pressey et al., 2016].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is supposed that combination treatment using dinutuximab beta, zoledronic acid and IL-2 is&#xD;
      more effective than their use in isolation. The already-established safety profiles of these&#xD;
      agents make testing of the combination in GD2 positive cancers such as GD2 expressing LMS&#xD;
      both rational and feasible [Fisher et al., 2015].&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) are a heterogeneous group of malignancies characterized by both&#xD;
      their relatively low incidence and their poor prognosis, encompassing more than 60 distinct&#xD;
      diagnoses. Leiomyosarcoma (LMS), together with liposarcoma, is one of the most frequent&#xD;
      sub-types amongst STS and accounts for up to 25% of all newly diagnosed STS [Guo et al.,&#xD;
      2015].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The absence of definite causative risk factors for LMS, whether genetic, epigenetic or&#xD;
      environmental, make this disease particularly difficult to understand and difficult to treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Classically, soft-tissue sarcomas (STS) have been treated as a single disease and with LMS as&#xD;
      one of the most frequent sub-types the results with conventional therapies have been rather&#xD;
      disappointing, especially in the advanced setting. The use of novel therapeutic approach such&#xD;
      immunotherapy has also not yielded the same success compared to other tumor entities, whereas&#xD;
      the heterogeneity of this malignancy certainly plays a role.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current immunotherapy trials mostly use monoclonal antibodies to target those molecules or&#xD;
      interactions, that essentially &quot;take the brakes off&quot; the immune system. If the underlying&#xD;
      immune response however is poor, simply taking the brakes off will be insufficient. In tumors&#xD;
      that do not trigger a sufficient immune response, it might be an advantages strategy to try&#xD;
      make the tumor a better target and thus trigger a better antitumor immune response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Strategies that incorporate the tumoricidal properties of gammadelta T cells (γδ T cells)&#xD;
      represent a promising immunotherapeutic strategy for treatment of solid malignancies&#xD;
      including neuroblastoma (NB) [Dieli et al., 2007]. An evaluation of pooled data from 132&#xD;
      published in vitro experiments shows a consistent improvement in the cytotoxicity of γδ T&#xD;
      cells in the presence of antitumor antibodies. Immunotherapy using γδ T cells alone shows&#xD;
      promising clinical activity, but there is a strong preclinical rationale for combining this&#xD;
      treatment modality with cancer-targeting antibodies to augment its efficacy [Fisher et al.,&#xD;
      2014].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dinutuximab beta was designed to bind to neuroblastoma cells and other cancer cells that&#xD;
      express the GD2 antigen, such as STS/LMS cells, and it is believed that this binding &quot;labels&quot;&#xD;
      the cells an makes them a better target.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, γδ T cells can safely be expanded in-vivo using intravenous zoledronic acid and&#xD;
      subcutaneous interleukin-2 (IL-2) in patients with different types of solid tumors [Dieli et&#xD;
      al., 2007; Pressey et al., 2016].&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is supposed that combination treatment using dinutuximab beta, zoledronic acid and IL-2 is&#xD;
      more effective than their use in isolation. The already-established safety profiles of these&#xD;
