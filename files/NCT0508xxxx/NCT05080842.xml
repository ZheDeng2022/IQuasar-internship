  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial is evaluating a drug called AC682 in participants with estrogen receptor&#xD;
      positive/human epidermal growth factor 2 negative (ER+/HER2-) locally advanced or metastatic&#xD;
      breast cancer. The main goals of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Find the recommended dose of AC682 that can be given safely to participants&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the side effects of AC682&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about pharmacokinetics of AC682&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Learn more about the effectiveness of AC682&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I, first in human, open-label dose-escalation study of AC682, an orally&#xD;
      available estrogen receptor degrader, given as a single agent.&#xD;
