  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a pilot study to test how a growing-up formula (GUF) compares to a common nutritional&#xD;
      supplement (NS), which is regularly used to help toddlers (ages 12-36 months) gain weight.&#xD;
      This study will look at whether GUF helps to increase solid food intake for children who are&#xD;
      thought to be &quot;picky eaters&quot; and see the effects on growth compared with the NS. To date, it&#xD;
      is not clear if GUFs help to increase intake of solid foods. Participants will be placed into&#xD;
      one of the two study arms: Enfagrow (GUF) or Pediasure (standard NS).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Healthy toddlers 12-36 months of age with mild malnutrition will be defined by at least one&#xD;
        of the following indicators:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Weight-for-length z-score between -1.0 and -1.9 for children less than 2 years of age&#xD;
             using the WHO growth standards; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. BMI z-score between -1 to -1.9 for children between 2 and 3 years of age using the CDC&#xD;
             growth standards; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Middle upper-arm circumference (MUAC) z-scores between -1 to -1.9 using the WHO growth&#xD;
             references; or&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Percentage of median ideal body weight of 80-89% (using the 50th percentile of the&#xD;
             aforementioned growth standards).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toddlers currently on or with history of tube feeding or with chronic health&#xD;
             conditions that influence eating (e.g., food allergies, genetic disorders or&#xD;
             developmental disabilities, oral motor difficulties that require sensory or feeding&#xD;
             therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toddlers who were born at less than 34 weeks gestation, as they may have lingering&#xD;
             feeding challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toddlers with gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) requiring medications or&#xD;
             hydrolyzed formula or any type of esophageal disorders will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toddlers with a history of infant reflux will not be excluded. The PI will make this&#xD;
             distinction after a detailed history and record review.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Families who do not speak English or Spanish in the home.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toddlers with suspected malabsorption or conditions that increased metabolic demands&#xD;
             such as congenital heart defects.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Toddlers who have a diagnosed allergy to cow's milk.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The PI will use their clinical discretion to ascertain patient eligibility.&#xD;
