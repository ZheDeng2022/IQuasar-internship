  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study looked at whether regular physical activity can influence sleep duration, sleep&#xD;
      quality and/or anxiety in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and&#xD;
      idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The link between exercise and sleep has already been observed in the literature, but the&#xD;
      impact of exercise on sleep is poorly understood. The question is how important is the&#xD;
      influence of regular physical activity on sleep, anxiety and depression in patients with COPD&#xD;
      or IPF.&#xD;

      Patients will be selected in two ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Intervention group: patients with COPD or idiopathic fibrosis following rehabilitation&#xD;
           program in our center, who meet the inclusion criteria will be invited to participate in&#xD;
           the survey and answer the questionnaires during the first week and again eight weeks&#xD;
           after the start of the rehabilitation program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Control group: patients with COPD or idiopathic fibrosis who do not perform any regular&#xD;
           physical activity will be invited to participate in the survey and answer the&#xD;
           questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaires are validated and the time allowed for completion is 45 minutes. The&#xD;
      questionnaires will assess sleep quality, anxiety and symptoms of depression.&#xD;

    <measure>Changes in sleep quality - sleepiness</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be assessed by the questionnaire &quot;Epworth Sleepiness Scale&quot;. A score between 0-5 indicates &quot;lower normal daytime sleeping&quot;; between 6-10 &quot;higher normal daytime sleepiness; 11-12 &quot;mil excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;; 13-15 &quot;moderate excessive daytime sleepiness&quot; and 16-24 &quot;severe excessive daytime sleepiness&quot;.</description>

    <measure>Changes in sleep quality - insomnia</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be assessed by the questionnaire &quot;Insomnia Severity Index &quot;. A scale is used to rank each item, where &quot;0&quot; means &quot;no problem&quot;, &quot;1 - mild problem&quot;, &quot;2 - moderate&quot; &quot;3 - severe&quot; and &quot;4 very severe problem&quot;. The total score is interpreted as absence of insomnia (0-7); sub-threshold insomnia (8-14); Moderate insomnia (15-21); and severe insomnia (22-28).</description>

    <measure>Changes in sleep quality - &quot;Morningness&quot; or &quot;eveningness&quot; types</measure>
    <time_frame>2 minutes</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality will be assessed by the questionnaire &quot;Morningness - Eveningness Questionnaire &quot;.

    <description>Back pain will be assessed by &quot;Oswestry Disability Index&quot;. It gives a subjective percentage score of level of function (disability) in activities of daily living in those rehabilitating from low back pain.&#xD;
The score goes to 0 to 100 describing the level of disability. The higher the score, the greater the severity of disability.</description>
