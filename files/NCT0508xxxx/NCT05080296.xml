  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The diagnosis of Parkinson's disease (PD) relies mainly on clinical observation of the&#xD;
      patient, looking for the three characteristic symptoms and sometimes remains a real&#xD;
      challenge. Machine Learning (ML) algorithms could help to diagnose PD early and differentiate&#xD;
      idiopathic PD from atypical Parkinsonian syndromes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, the work of Castillo-Barnes' team provided a set of imaging features based&#xD;
      on morphological characteristics extracted from DaTSCAN® or Ioflupane (iodine-123-labeled&#xD;
      radiopharmaceutical) single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans to discern&#xD;
      healthy participants from participants with Parkinson's disease in a balanced set of SPECTs&#xD;
      from the &quot;Parkinson's Progression Markers Initiative&quot; (PPMI) data base.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The team of Shabii et al, evaluated the classification performance of Parkinson's patients&#xD;
      and normal controls when semi-quantitative indicators and shape features obtained on the&#xD;
      dopamine transporter (DAT) by Ioflupane (123I-IP) single-photon emission computed tomography&#xD;
      (SPECT) are combined as a machine learning (ML) feature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AI-based methods can improve diagnostic assessments. Several dopaminergic imaging studies&#xD;
      using AI have reported accuracy of up to 90% for the diagnosis of PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These automated approaches use machine learning methods, based on textural analyses, to (i)&#xD;
      differentiate PD and healthy subjects, (ii) differentiate PD and vascular parkinsonism, and&#xD;
      (iii) distinguish between different forms of atypical parkinsonism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A study conducted in 2 centers using a linear support vector machine (SVM) model&#xD;
      discriminated patients with PD and healthy subjects with an accuracy of 82.5%.This&#xD;
      performance is similar to visual assessment by nuclear physicians A linear SVM model based on&#xD;
      voxel values of statistical parametric images was able to differentiate PD from vascular&#xD;
      parkinsonism with an accuracy of 90.4%. The Nancy team has extensive experience in the&#xD;
      detection of PD in SPECT and SPECT/CT scans with Ioflupane or DaTSCAN™&#xD;
