  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Cross-education describes the transfer of motor performance to the opposite limb following&#xD;
      unilateral training and is primarily explained by adaptations within the brain. The mirror&#xD;
      training hypothesis suggests that illusionary mirror visual feedback may augment the&#xD;
      cross-education of strength to the untrained, contralateral limb. The purpose of this project&#xD;
      is to examine how the use of illusionary mirror visual feedback shapes the neuromuscular&#xD;
      adaptations that occur for both limbs during unilateral (single-limb) strength training. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that mirror training will augment the level of cross-education for the&#xD;
      untrained arm.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent empirical evidence shows a heightened level of strength transfer with the use of&#xD;
      illusionary mirror visual feedback, but this was shown for the small muscles of the wrist&#xD;
      during isokinetic training. It is unknown if larger, multi-joint muscles respond favorably to&#xD;
      mirror training in practical settings. A randomized controlled study design will allocate&#xD;
      approximately 20 participants into two groups. One group will perform unilateral strength&#xD;
      training with illusionary mirror visual feedback (Mirror) and the other will perform the same&#xD;
      unilateral strength training but without a mirror (No-Mirror). The intervention will involve&#xD;
      four weeks of unilateral strength training performed twice weekly at high intensities&#xD;
      (&gt;80%1RM).&#xD;
