      Study Objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the safety of osimertinib treatment continuation during irradiation therapy for&#xD;
      palliation or oligoprogressive disease by assessment of grade 3-5 AEs during and after&#xD;
      concomitant osimertinib and irradiation of tumor sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the efficacy of osimertinib treatment continuation during irradiation therapy for&#xD;
      palliation or oligoprogressive disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate Quality of Life during and after irradiation therapy and concomitant&#xD;
      osimertinib.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Many patients with advanced lung cancer require palliative irradiation of metastases to&#xD;
      relieve symptoms and prevent local complications. In addition, guidelines recommend local&#xD;
      treatment (including radiation) for oligoprogression during TKI treatment. Clinicians are&#xD;
      faced with the decision whether to continue TKI therapy during irradiation, a practice for&#xD;
      which there is little data, or to interrupt the oral treatment for the duration of radiation,&#xD;
      which may lead to progression of non-irradiated lesions. For erlotinib and gefitinib there is&#xD;
      some data indicating that cranial irradiation as well as stereotactic body irradiation may be&#xD;
      carried out safely without discontinuing or interrupting the TKI treatment. Although some&#xD;
      small case series report on a PFS benefit with irradiation during osimertinib treatment,&#xD;
      there is very limited data on the safety of osimertinib during irradiation, and no&#xD;
      evidence-based recommendations around stopping osimertinib for irradiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis is that osimertinib can be continued without interruption during irradiation&#xD;
      of individual tumor lesions in the setting of oligoprogressive NSCLC in stage IV, or for the&#xD;
      palliation of local symptoms.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Provision of written informed consent prior to any study specific procedures,&#xD;
             including screening evaluations that are not SOC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Age â‰¥ 18 years at time of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Histologically confirmed stage IV NSCLC&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Ongoing or planned osimertinib treatment according to marketing authorization (first&#xD;
             line treatment of tumor positive for a common or uncommon EGFR mutation, or later line&#xD;
             treatment of tumor positive for EGFR T790M mutation, assessed according to local&#xD;
             standard. First line therapy is defined as therapy used to treat advanced disease.&#xD;
             Each subsequent line of therapy is preceded by disease progression. A switch of an&#xD;
             agent within a regimen in order to manage toxicity does not define the start of a new&#xD;
             line of therapy. Experimental therapies when given as separate regimen are considered&#xD;
             as separate line of therapy. Maintenance therapy following platinum doublet-based&#xD;
             chemotherapy is not considered as a separate regimen of therapy.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Clinical indication for palliative radiotherapy of one or more lesions, either for&#xD;
             local symptom control of primary tumor or metastasis, or for oligoprogressive&#xD;
             metastasis, with conventional or stereotactic strategy. Radiotherapy of metastatic&#xD;
             sites can be for bone, solid organ or soft-tissue lesions; initial size of brain&#xD;
             metastases should be &lt; 3 cm. Lung lesions should be no more than 5 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Life expectancy â‰¥12 weeks&#xD;

             a negative pregnancy test and not be breast-feeding prior to start of dosing if of&#xD;
             child-bearing potential or must have evidence of non-child-bearing potential by&#xD;
             fulfilling one of the following criteria at screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Post-menopausal defined as aged more than 50 years and amenorrheic for at least&#xD;
                  12 months following cessation of all exogenous hormonal treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women under 50 years old would be considered postmenopausal if they have been&#xD;
                  amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal&#xD;
                  treatments and with LH and FSH levels in the post-menopausal range for the&#xD;

             effective contraception. Men who are azoospermic do not require contraception.&#xD;

             study, including hospital visits for treatment and scheduled follow-up visits and&#xD;
             examinations.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Negative COVID-19 test within 1 week prior to starting irradiation if clinically&#xD;
             required by current regional COVID-19 outbreak situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational&#xD;
             (non-interventional) clinical study, or during the follow-up period of an&#xD;
             interventional study.&#xD;
&#xD;

             conditions (e.g., hormone replacement therapy) is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Any unresolved toxicities from prior therapy greater than grade I (exception:&#xD;
             alopecia, grade 2 neuropathy) which in the investigator's opinion would jeopardise&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol or worsen during irradiation&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Cardiac side-effects of osimertinib not sufficiently improved by dose reduction as&#xD;
             suggested by the label/ German &quot;Fachinformation&quot;.&#xD;

&#xD;
          8. Major surgery (as defined by the Investigator) within 4 weeks prior to starting the&#xD;
             study; patients must have recovered from effects of preceding major surgery. Note:&#xD;
             Local non-major surgery for palliative intent (e.g., surgery of isolated lesions) is&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Any clinically important abnormalities in rhythm, conduction or morphology of&#xD;
                  resting ECG e.g. complete left bundle branch block, third degree heart block and&#xD;

             hypertension and active bleeding diatheses, which in the investigator's opinion makes&#xD;
             it undesirable for the patient to participate in the trial or which would jeopardise&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol, or active infection including hepatitis B, hepatitis C&#xD;
             and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Screening for chronic conditions is not&#xD;

                  carrier state).&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Refractory nausea and vomiting, chronic gastrointestinal diseases, inability to&#xD;

             effective birth control from screening to 4 months after the last dose of osimertinib&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Patients who are unable to consent because they do not understand the nature,&#xD;
             significance and implications of the clinical trial and therefore cannot form a&#xD;
             rational intention in the light of the facts [Â§ 40 Abs. 1 S. 3 Nr. 3a AMG]&#xD;
