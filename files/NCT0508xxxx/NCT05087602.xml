    <textblock>
      Malignant melanoma (MM) is one of the most malignant tumors. It is easy to metastasize at an&#xD;
      early stage, has a high mortality rate, and its incidence is increasing year by year. This&#xD;
      study aims to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the combined application of Anlotinib&#xD;
      Hydrochloride Capsules and Toripalimab in the treatment of unresectable stage III and stage&#xD;
      IV acral malignant melanoma confirmed by pathology.&#xD;
