  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a first-in-human, Phase I study to assess the safety of ProAgio in participants&#xD;
      with advanced solid tumor malignancies including pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic cancer is the third leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. The&#xD;
      median overall survival for patients with metastatic disease who are receiving the most&#xD;
      effective combination of chemotherapy regimens remains less than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ProAgio has been evaluated in nonclinical pharmacology, safety pharmacology, pharmacokinetic&#xD;
      (PK), and toxicity studies. It has demonstrated efficacy at treating pancreatic cancer and&#xD;
      prolonging survival in mice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ProAgio is being developed for intravenous (IV) administration. All participants will receive&#xD;
      ProAgio until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or withdrawal from study. Subjects&#xD;
      in the dose escalation cohorts who will be administered ProAgio at doses ranging from 3.2 to&#xD;
      36.8 mg/kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the dose escalation phase, an expansion cohort of patients with advanced&#xD;
      nonendocrine pancreatic adenocarcinoma will be administered ProAgio at the maximum tolerated&#xD;
      dose (MTD) from the dose escalation phase. The expansion cohort will comprise 16 subjects,&#xD;
      divided into two blocks (n=8 each) of patients who agree to have optional pre and&#xD;
      post-treatment biopsies, and those who decline the optional biopsies.&#xD;

             study drug. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her&#xD;
             partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician&#xD;
             immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability of subject to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Participants who are receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of significant, uncontrolled concomitant diseases which could affect&#xD;
             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including but not limited&#xD;

             uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, unstable angina, significant cardiovascular disease&#xD;
             (such as New York Heart Association Class III or IV cardiac disease) and/or&#xD;
             psychiatric illness/social situations within 12 weeks that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known diagnosis of a chronic neurologic disorders (such as multiple&#xD;
             sclerosis, Huntington's disease, Parkinson's disease, or uncontrolled epilepsy) which&#xD;

             of neurologic toxicity caused by the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or nursing women are excluded from this study because ProAgio is an agent&#xD;
             with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an&#xD;
             unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;

             the last 14 days. For dose escalation cohort only: Participants with any known CNS&#xD;
             metastases are excluded. Those with symptoms suggestive of possible CNS metastases&#xD;
             (such as new headaches) must undergo brain MRI as part of screening.&#xD;
&#xD;

             documented evidence of effective treatment and/or cure with undetectable viral load.&#xD;
