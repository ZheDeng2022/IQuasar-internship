  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      the SARS-CoV2 pandemic has led to a major reorganization of the French Hematology and stem&#xD;
      cell transplant departments since march 2020. Since the allogeneic stem cell transplant&#xD;
      cannot be delayed especially when patients with hematological malignancies are in a fragile&#xD;
      remission, risking relapse at any time, the necessity to maintain safe hematopoietic stem&#xD;
      cell (HSC) donations from match unrelated or family donors appears rapidly mandatory during&#xD;
      the pandemic period. To increase the safety of voluntary donations, a SARS-CoV2 Polymerase&#xD;
      Chain Reaction test has been recommended to donors by regulatory agencies. However, due to&#xD;
      the lack of homogeneity of care at European level, some countries do not require SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      testing in asymptomatic donors. In this case, the test is performed on additional EDTA tube&#xD;
      accompanying the graft on arrival or in the case of a missing tube (not collected or&#xD;
      forgotten), on few milliliters of the HSC graft. This circuit had the consequence of forcing&#xD;
      the clinicians to wait for the test result before starting the patient's conditioning&#xD;
      regimen. The graft being already collected and received at the transplant center, and the&#xD;
      conditioning regimen lasting on an average of 5 days, this resulted in its conservation&#xD;
      during this minimum period and therefore its freezing by the associated cell therapy unit.&#xD;
      However, this practice has so far been exceptional regarding allogeneic transplants, which&#xD;
      are primarily freshly infused to ensure to the recipient the highest viability and&#xD;
      functionality of stem cells. Since the entire freezing-thawing and washing process may impact&#xD;
      cell viability and delay the patient's aplastic recovery, this study aimed to analyze the&#xD;
      results of one year of allogeneic transplants infused after freezing in terms of graft&#xD;
      quality after thawing and clinical consequences.&#xD;
