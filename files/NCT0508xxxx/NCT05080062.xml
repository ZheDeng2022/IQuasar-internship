    <textblock>
      Requirements and functional Schedule also calen Demand Ability Protocol (DAP) is an&#xD;
      intervention that has been tested and found useful in occupational health service. The&#xD;
      intervention aims to strengthen the collaboration between Health care, employers and&#xD;
      employee. The intervention is based on a structured interview about the employers demands at&#xD;
      work. This intervention (DAP) will in the present study be evaluated in pain rehabilitation&#xD;
      both qualitatively and quantitatively.&#xD;

      Description of the intervention: Demand and Ability Protocol Demand and Ability Protocol&#xD;
      (DAP) is an intervention linked to the International Classification of Functioning,&#xD;
      Disability and Health, and is based on the Dutch Functional Ability List and knowledge about&#xD;
      disability in working life (Brouwer et al, 2002). The intervention has been further developed&#xD;
      and modified in Norway and is primarily used in occupational health care services for&#xD;
      collaboration between an employee and his or her immediate manager (Engbers &amp; Furuland,&#xD;
      2006).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention consists of a structured conversation between the patient and his immediate&#xD;
      manager under the guidance of licensed medical staff (in this case REKO) with knowledge of&#xD;
      the requirements of the patient's work and his/her current functional ability. The&#xD;
      intervention takes about 90 minutes excluding preparation time for REKO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DAP consider the following domains; 1) mental and cognitive ability, 2) basic skills and&#xD;
      social ability, 3) tolerance for physical conditions, 4) ability to work dynamically, 5)&#xD;
      ability to work statically and 6) to be able to work certain times.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the above domains, a structured review is made of the balance between requirements&#xD;
      and function in current work in order to identify possible adaptations and measures at the&#xD;
      workplace. During the intervention, the work requirements and the patient's function/ability&#xD;
      are identified on a three-point scale and in domains where the rating of requirements and&#xD;
      function/ability does not match, there is thus an imbalance, and here adjustments or changed&#xD;
      tasks may be relevant to consider increasing work ability and reducing sick leave. The&#xD;
      intervention concludes with a summary of the situation and joint development of appropriate&#xD;
      measures/adaptations to promote the patient's RTW. This is documented on a form, which is&#xD;
      signed by both the patient and the manage&#xD;
