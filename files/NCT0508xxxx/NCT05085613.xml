  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study seeks to assess the efficacy of educational messages to correct misperceptions.&#xD;
      People hold a number of misperceptions that are relevant to public health, including&#xD;
      misperceptions regarding COVID vaccines. Some people incorrectly think the COVID vaccines&#xD;
      authorized by FDA are not safe or effective. These misperceptions can reduce adherence to&#xD;
      public health recommendations and result in continued spread of COVID. This study will test&#xD;
      if humor and different types of framing increase the efficacy of messages to correct&#xD;
      misperceptions about FDA's authorized coronavirus vaccine safety and effectiveness. The&#xD;
      frames tested will include: framing the vaccine as a way to boost economic recovery and&#xD;
      framing the vaccine as a way to increase freedom to choose how to behave. The addition of&#xD;
      humor will also be tested. Message efficacy will be measured via improved accuracy of beliefs&#xD;
      after being exposed to the message. In other words, participants will be asked how safe and&#xD;
      effective FDA authorized COVID vaccines are before seeing a message, then they will see a&#xD;
      message about why the COVID vaccines are safe and effective, and then they will again be&#xD;
      asked how safe and effective they think the vaccines are. This study will also assess the&#xD;
      accuracy of inferential beliefs. This will be accomplished by asking participants questions&#xD;
      about other vaccines that either are or are not authorized by FDA. If participants have&#xD;
      understood the messages and updated their mental models of how FDA evaluates vaccines, they&#xD;
      should be able to infer if other vaccines are safe and effective based on their FDA&#xD;
      authorization status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Participants who are exposed to A.) a message with humor, B.) a message with an economic&#xD;
      recovery fame, or C.) a message with a freedom frame will be more likely to increase their&#xD;
      agreement with the statement that the FDA will only authorize coronavirus vaccines that are&#xD;
      safe and effective after message exposure than participants exposed to the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Participants who are exposed to A.) a message with humor, B.) a message with an economic&#xD;
      recovery fame, or C.) a message with a freedom frame will agree more strongly with the&#xD;
      statement that the FDA approved flu vaccine is safe and effective after message exposure than&#xD;
      participants exposed to the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3. Participants who are exposed to A.) a message with humor, B.) a message with an economic&#xD;
      recovery fame, or C.) a message with a freedom frame will agree more strongly with the&#xD;
      statement that the ResVax vaccine, which was not approved by the FDA for the treatment of&#xD;
      RSV, is a safe and effective after message exposure than participants exposed to the control&#xD;
      condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H4. Participants who are exposed to A.) a message with humor, B.) a message with an economic&#xD;
      recovery fame, or C.) a message with a freedom frame will be more likely to increase&#xD;
      behavioral intentions to get an FDA authorized COVID vaccine after message exposure than&#xD;
      participants exposed to the control condition.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Model Description: Participants will be randomized to view one of four messages. The control message explains why people are hesitant to accept the FDA authorized COVID vaccines are safe and effective and how they are evaluated. Arm 2 additionally includes consequent framing regarding economic recovery (e.g. &quot;If everyone gets vaccinated, we can keep schools, stores, and other businesses open so more Americans can keep working and supporting their families.&quot; With a picture of an &quot;open for business&quot; sign), arm 3 includes consequent framing regarding freedom to behave as one chooses (e.g. &quot;Everyone getting vaccinated is the key to freedom! A vaccine can give us the freedom to hang out with friends, shop, and worship together again safely.&quot; With a picture of an American flag), and arm 4 includes humor (e.g. &quot;Unfortunately, everyone getting vaccinated means leaving the house again.&quot;).</intervention_model_description>
