      Healthcare-associated infections often have multiple etiologies, of which cleanliness of&#xD;
      hospital surfaces can play a large role. This is perhaps most important in the operating&#xD;
      room, where a sterile environment is paramount to decreasing the burden of hospital-acquired&#xD;
      morbidity and surgical site infections. Contaminated hospital surfaces greatly contribute to&#xD;
      the transmission of healthcare associated pathogens, including methicillin-resistant&#xD;
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus spp (VRE), and Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile Surgical site infections (SSIs) are infections that occur after surgery in the part&#xD;
      of the body where the surgery took place and account for about 14-20% of all&#xD;
      hospital-acquired (nosocomial) infections. Some are superficial, involving only the skin,&#xD;
      while others are more serious and can involve tissues under the skin, organs, or implanted&#xD;
      material. Factors causing SSIs are known to be multifarious. Superficial SSIs are most often&#xD;
      associated with environmental factors, such as environmental contamination by fungi and&#xD;
      bacteria, surface contamination, humidity, differential pressure and temperature of the OR,&#xD;
      while factors that determine deep and organ/space SSIs are more often associated with patient&#xD;
      characteristics (age, sex, transfusion, nasogastric feeding and nutrition, as measured by the&#xD;
      level of albumin in the blood), type of intervention and preoperative stay .&#xD;
&#xD;
      SSIs continue to be a major problem in modern medicine, with both individual and economic&#xD;
      consequences. They are the most frequent nosocomial infections in low- and middle-income&#xD;
      countries, affecting up to one third of patients who have undergone a surgical procedure,&#xD;
      while in high-income countries they are the second most frequent type .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contaminated surfaces and fomites are considered an important reservoir of (multi-resistant)&#xD;
      microorganisms in hospitals. Therefore, cleaning of the environment is important for reducing&#xD;
      bacterial spread, controlling antimicrobial resistance and improving patient .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Air quality in ORs should be assessed during microbiological commissioning of new ORs and&#xD;
      whenever required thereafter. OR ventilations are very much variable from country to country,&#xD;
      within a country and even within a hospital as per requirement and availability. Ventilation&#xD;
      systems are classified as conventional plenum ventilation (CV), laminar flow ventilation&#xD;
      (LAF), wall mounted air conditioners and free-standing air conditioners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial monitoring of ORs (and also of other controlled environments, such as recovery&#xD;
      rooms) is therefore essential to obtain representative estimates of the bioburden of the&#xD;
      environment. It includes quantitation of the microbial content of room air, compressor air&#xD;
      that enters the critical area, surfaces, equipment, sanitization containers, floors, walls&#xD;
      and personnel garments and also the search for Legionella pneumophila in the water systems.&#xD;
      Information gathered from the data compiled and analysed can then be useful in the&#xD;
      investigation of the source of the contamination and the subsequent adoption of preventive&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The assessment of the cleanliness of surfaces in hospitals is mostly conducted by visual&#xD;
      inspection. This method is not sensitive and subjective and therefore unreliable. Recently, a&#xD;
      more objective technique was introduced to measure biological contamination. This technique&#xD;
      is based on the measurement of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a molecule that is present in&#xD;
      all organic cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Traditional microbiological techniques are the most commonly used methods to evaluate&#xD;
      hygienic quality, but they require specific skills, long execution and analysis times and are&#xD;
      therefore unsuitable for routine monitoring. In the last decade alternative methods for&#xD;
      assessing environmental cleanliness have been proposed, including the adenosine triphosphate&#xD;
      (ATP) bioluminescence assay,based on the measurement of levels of ATP present on an&#xD;
      environmental surface. Bioluminescence test exploits the chemiluminescence properties of&#xD;
      luciferin-luciferase reagent, which reacts with any ATP residue present on a substrate,&#xD;
      emitting light and measuring the presence of organic matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The air Sampler is a high-performance instrument that is based on the principle of the&#xD;
      Andersen air sampler, which aspirates air through a perforated plate. The resulting airflow&#xD;
      is directed onto a 90 mm Petri dish containing agar. For each air sample collection, the air&#xD;
      Sampler equipment is placed on a firm support at about 1 m above the ground, the perforated&#xD;
      lid is opened by rotating to the right and cleaned with isopropanol. Next, a closed 90 mm&#xD;
      Petri dish filled with agar isplaced on top of the dish support, the lid was taken off the&#xD;
      Petri dish, the air Sampler perforated lid is closed, the angle of the sampling head is&#xD;
      adjusted and the equipment is programmed to aspire 500 L of air (flow rate of 100L/min).&#xD;
      After the collection cycle, the sampling head is opened and the Petri dish is closed with the&#xD;
      Petri dish cover and placed in the cooler to later be transported to the laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microbial monitoring of ORs (and also of other controlled environments, such as recovery&#xD;
      rooms) is therefore essential to obtain representative estimates of the bioburden of the&#xD;
      environment. It includes quantitation of the microbial content of room air, compressor air&#xD;
      that enters the critical area, surfaces, equipment, sanitization containers, floors, walls&#xD;
      and personnel garments and also the search for Legionella pneumophila in the water systems.&#xD;
      Information gathered from the data compiled and analysed can then be useful in the&#xD;
      investigation of the source of the contamination and the subsequent adoption of preventive&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then research has provided evidence of the importance of establishing environmental&#xD;
      monitoring programs to control and maintain an aseptic hospital environment, especially in&#xD;
      operating rooms.&#xD;
