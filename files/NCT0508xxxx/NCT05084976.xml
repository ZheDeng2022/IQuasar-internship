  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study involves conducting a telephonic or in person survey regarding parental perception&#xD;
      and attitudes about vaccinating the respective &quot;technology dependent&quot; child with the COVID 19&#xD;
      vaccination. &quot;Technology dependent&quot; includes tracheostomy dependence, artificial ventilator&#xD;
      dependence and non invasive mechanical ventilation dependence. This population is vulnerable&#xD;
      since most patients have underlying lung disease, chronic respiratory failure and require&#xD;
      respiratory equipment to assist with breathing. &quot;Technology dependent&quot; patients are&#xD;
      particularly vulnerable to respiratory infections and are considered high risk for developing&#xD;
      severe COVID 19 illness. Despite this population's high risk for morbidity and mortality from&#xD;
      respiratory viral infections, the investigator hypothesize that 50% of the parents are still&#xD;
      vaccine hesitant.&#xD;

      Vaccinating the population is the next step in combating COVID 19 pandemic however there&#xD;
      continues to be vaccine hesitancy. Vaccine hesitancy is the indecision of consenting to&#xD;
      vaccination (Dosanjh, 2021) and is not a new phenomenon. The most recent example is the&#xD;
      reemergence of measles in the United States prior to the COVID 19 pandemic. Anti-vaccine&#xD;
      groups have spread messages of conspiracy theories, myths and misperceptions, questions about&#xD;
      the speed of vaccine development and long term side effects in the media which also&#xD;
      attributes to COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy (Khubcandani et al, 2021).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children infected with COVID 19 typically have mild symptoms of the disease. Risk factors&#xD;
      associated with severe disease are neonatal age group, male gender, lower respiratory tract&#xD;
      disease and pre-existing medical conditions. Children who use chronic home mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation are considered a high-risk group for developing severe COVID 19 infection&#xD;
      (Vasconcello-Castillo et al., 2020). These children have various diagnoses and pathologies&#xD;
      such as neuromuscular disease, sleep disorders and chronic lung disease. These patients&#xD;
      require continuous use of ventilatory support in the home and are at high risk for&#xD;
      respiratory infections and mortality. Most of these patients need advanced nursing care and&#xD;
      special respiratory equipment to prevent hospitalization such as manual chest physiotherapy,&#xD;
      mechanical ex-sufflator device, chest vest device and increased ventilator support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently the FDA approved of Pfizer's COVID 19 vaccine in ages 12 and older. It is&#xD;
      anticipated that by fall 2021 the Pfizer COVID 19 vaccine will be approved by the FDA for&#xD;
      children ages 2 and older. Vaccinating children will help decrease transmission of COVID 19,&#xD;
      contribute to community immunity and allow kids go back to camps this summer and back to&#xD;
      in-person school more safely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the chronic home mechanical ventilation population is at risk for developing severe&#xD;
      COVID 19 disease, the investigator would hypothesize that most parents are ready and willing&#xD;
      to vaccinate their children. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the parental perception&#xD;
      of COVID 19 vaccine in pediatric patients with &quot;technology dependence&quot; and identify the&#xD;
      barriers to vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surveys are collected and barriers are identified, vaccine counseling will be provided&#xD;
      by a provider (nurse practitioner or physician). Vaccine safety, efficacy, side effects will&#xD;
      be reviewed with the parents.&#xD;
