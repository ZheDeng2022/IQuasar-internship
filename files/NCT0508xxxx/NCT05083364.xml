  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of AROC3-1001 is to evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics and/or&#xD;
      pharmacodynamics in adult healthy volunteers (HVs) and in adult patients with paroxysmal&#xD;
      nocturnal hemoglobinuria (PNH) and adult patients with complement-mediated renal disease (C3&#xD;
      Glomerulopathy [C3G] and IgA Nephropathy [IgAN]). In Part 1 of the study, HVs will receive a&#xD;
      single dose of ARO-C3 or placebo. In Part 2 of the study, adult patients with PNH or C3G/IgAN&#xD;
      will receive 2 open-label doses of ARO-C3. Dose levels in Part 2 will be determined based on&#xD;
      cumulative safety and pharmacodynamic data from Part 1.&#xD;
