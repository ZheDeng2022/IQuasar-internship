  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pacients who use mechanical ventilation (MV) need to pass weaning, a interruption process of&#xD;
      ventilatory support. To predict this outcome, several scores have been developed, however,&#xD;
      fail index in weaning and extubation remains high. The objective of this study is to evaluate&#xD;
      the effect of ExPreS - Extubation Predictive Score - on rates of successful extubation. By a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial, this reseach will take place in ICUs of several hospitals.&#xD;
      Therefore, it is expected that a difference between devices to predict extubation sucess&#xD;
      exists and, because ExPreS is a protocol that evaluates different parameters related to many&#xD;
      organs and systems, it presents a better capacity of predicting extubation sucess in MV&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

      1. OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1 General To evaluate the effect of ExPreS - Extubation Predictive Score - on rates of&#xD;
           successful extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2 Specific To compare sucess predctive capacity of ExPreS over standard protocol of&#xD;
           the place of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To identify sucess and failure rate of extubation in 48 hours according applied&#xD;
           protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To compare MV time and extubation sucess rate between patients who perform spontaneous&#xD;
           breathing trial (SBT) in T-ayre and the ones with PSV mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. PARTICIPANTS SELECTION The sample will be formed by admitted pacients in ICUs of&#xD;
           participating institutions, on MV for more than 24 hours. The inclusion criteria are&#xD;
           pacients admitted in ICU that are more than 18 years and in MV for more than 24 hours.&#xD;
           The assignature of the free and informed consent form by a family member or responsable&#xD;
           adult is necessary. The exclusion criteria are death before SBT, tracheostomy,&#xD;
           self-extubation, accidental extubation and absence of signature of informed consent. The&#xD;
           pacient who fails extubation and needs reintubation will not be randomized.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. RANDOMIZATION Pacients that meet criteria for initiation of MV weaning - improvement in&#xD;
           the condition that caused the respiratory failure; a partial pressure of arterial oxygen&#xD;
           higher than 60mmHg, with fraction of inspired oxygen lower than 0.4, and positive&#xD;
           end-expiratory pressure of 5 cm of water or less; hemodynamically stable (without or low&#xD;
           dose of vasopressors, absence of decompensated coronary insufficiency or arrhythmias&#xD;
           with hemodynamic repercussion); patient's ability to initiate an inspiratory effort;&#xD;
           absence of a significant acid-base imbalance, tolerate PSV mode with PEEP of 3-5 and&#xD;
           pressure over the PEEP of 7 cmH2O with adequate ventilation (volume of 6 ml/kg and RR Ëƒ&#xD;
           35/min) - will fit the conditions and be randomized and submitted to SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The randomization will be executed in the program www.random.org and, for allocation&#xD;
           concealment, generated numbers will be placed in seald and opaque envelopes with the&#xD;
           previously defined nomenclature for each group: group I (T-ayre and standard protocol)&#xD;
           and group II (T-ayre and ExPreS protocol). The envelopes will be numbered and placed in&#xD;
           sequence. Therefore, evaluator and researchers are prevented from choosing the group to&#xD;
           witch the individual will be assigned. Only one person will be responsible for opening&#xD;
           the envelope and informing in witch group he or she was assigned to.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. INTERVENTION Pacients will be assigned to different interventions according to each&#xD;
           group. The failure criteria on SBT will be the same for all groups: agitation, anxiety,&#xD;
           decreased level of consciousness, respiratory rate higher than 35/min and/or acessory&#xD;
           muscle use, oxygen saturation measured by pulse oxymetry lower than 90% with fraction of&#xD;
           inspired oxygen lower than 0.4 more than 0.5, heart rate higher than 140 bpm or an&#xD;
           increase higher than 20% of the basal, systolic blood pressure (SBP) lower than 90 mmHg&#xD;
           or higher than 180 mmHg or presenting arrhythmia after the intiation of SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On gruop I (T-ayre and standard protocol), SBT must begin with the pacient in T-ayre,&#xD;
           oxygen support that is proprotional to the fraction of inspired oxygen in invasive&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation (IMV), during 30 minutes. If the pacient does not show any sign&#xD;
           of SBT failure, the rapid shallow beathing index (RSBI) will be calculated and pacients&#xD;
           with RSBI lower than 105 L/min will be extubated, meanwhile pacients with RSBI higher&#xD;
           than 105 L/min will return to MV for at least 24 hours until the perfomance of a new&#xD;
           SBT.&#xD;
&#xD;
           On group II (T-ayre and ExPreS protocol), the pacient will be submitted to the SBT with&#xD;
           T-ayre, with oxygen support that is proprotional to the fraction of inspired oxygen in&#xD;
           IMV, during 30 minutes. If the pacient does not show any sign of SBT failure, ExPreS&#xD;
           will be calculated. If punctuation is lower than or equal to 44, it indicates weaning&#xD;
           failure and the pacient mjust return to MV for 24 hours at least. Punctuation between 45&#xD;
           and 58 must be evaluated if the pacient presents chronic obstructive pulmonary desease&#xD;
           (COPD), obesity or heart desease. In this case, non invasive ventilation (NIV) should be&#xD;
           scheduled or the weaning must be continued if there isn't any risck factors. Punctuation&#xD;
           higher than or equal 59 indicates that the pacient can be extubated.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pacients of both groups will be submitted to evaluation of ariway permability by the&#xD;
           cuff leak teste. Pacients with a difference higher than 10% between the inspiratory and&#xD;
           expiratory tidal volume are able to extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. OUTCOMES The primary outcome in both groups is extubation success in 48 hours. To be&#xD;
           considered positive, the pacient must remain without the need of returning to MV for 48&#xD;
           hours at least and can't deppend on NIV on the next 48 hours after the extubation. The&#xD;
           secondary outcomes are reintubation, IMV length of stay, ICU length of stay, hospital&#xD;
           length of stay and in hospital mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. RESEARCH INTRUMENTS The instruments for data collection are forms elaborated by the&#xD;
           researchers. The form choice will be made by randomization, that will happen after 24&#xD;
           hours of MV with endotracheal tube, following inclusion and exclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. DATA ANALYSIS Collected data will be tabulated on Microsoft Excel program and the&#xD;
           statistic analysis will be made on IBM SPSS statistics, v25 and GraphPad Prism 6&#xD;
           programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. ETHICAL ASPECTS This project was forwarded to the research comission of hospital&#xD;
           institution of interest for authorization of research performance and to the Research&#xD;
           Ethics Comittee of Unoesc and it was approved by number 4.524.592 (CAAE&#xD;
           39925920.0.0000.5367). It will follow ethical principles of the Resolution number&#xD;
           466/2021, of the Nacional Health Council. The research will have commitment wih data'&#xD;
           privacy and confidentiality, by preserving the anonymity of the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is classified as low risk for research participants, causing little discomfort&#xD;
      for the pacient, that is justified by the benefit expected. None intervention or intentional&#xD;
      modification on physiological or psychological and socials variables of individuals that&#xD;
      joined the study will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The benefits of participating are indirect for pacients, although, by the evidence of better&#xD;
      outcome, the study proposes better testing of protocols, witch will contribute for the&#xD;
      elaboration of strategies to reach a better extubation sucess.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consent to join the study will be formalized by the signature of free and informed&#xD;
      consent form, that will be given in two copies, one for the familiar member or responsible&#xD;
      individual and one for the researchers, according to Resolution 466/2021, of the Nacional&#xD;
      Health Council To keep all individuals' safety, precautionary measures for COVID-19&#xD;
      transmission will be adopted. Hands will be sanitized with alcohol 70% as enterring the&#xD;
      institution, before and after enterring the ICU and before document manipulation. Masks will&#xD;
      be used all the time.&#xD;
