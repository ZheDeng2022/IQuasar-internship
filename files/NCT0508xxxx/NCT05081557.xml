  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atopic dermatitis (AD; also known as atopic eczema) is an inflammatory skin disease. The&#xD;
      safety and effectiveness of upadacitinib for AD has been well-documented in previous studies,&#xD;
      however, important information is missing on the use patterns and outcomes with upadacitinib&#xD;
      in a real-world setting. Therefore, the purpose of this observational study is to help inform&#xD;
      real-world usage patterns regarding the safety and effectiveness and duration of response of&#xD;
      upadacitinib in adolescent and adult AD participants &gt;=12 years old in the real-world&#xD;
      setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upadacitinib is an approved drug being developed for the treatment of AD. Around 975&#xD;
      adolescent and adult participants who are prescribed upadacitinib for the treatment of AD in&#xD;
      routine clinical practice will be enrolled worldwide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive oral upadacitinib as prescribed by their physician. Data from these&#xD;
      participants will be collected for approximately 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be no additional burden for participants in this trial compared to their standard&#xD;
      of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the course of the study at a hospital&#xD;
      or clinic and will be asked to provide additional information by questionnaire at each visit.&#xD;

    <description>vIGA-AD is a validated assessment instrument used in clinical studies to rate the severity of AD globally. A 5-point scale is used to measure the severity of disease at the time of the investigator's evaluation of the participant ranging from 0 - Clear (no inflammatory signs of atopic dermatitis (no erythema, no induration/papulation, no lichenification, no oozing/crusting). Post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and/or hypopigmentation may be present.) to 4 - Severe (marked erythema (deep or bright red), marked induration/papulation, and/or marked lichenification.</description>

    <time_frame>Up to Approximately 24 months</time_frame>
    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) are each assessed for severity by the investigator on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement is assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk (including the genital area), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks), and converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%). The EASI score ranges from 0-72 points with an MCID of 6.6 points. Published score bands: clear (0), almost clear (0.1-1.0), mild AD (1.1-7.0), moderate AD (7.1-21.0), severe AD (21.1-50.0), very severe AD (50.1-72.0).</description>

    <description>The ADCT is a validated patient self-administered instrument designed to assess AD control status in adult and adolescent patients (12 years and older). Six AD symptoms and impacts are evaluated over the past week including overall severity of symptoms, days with intense episodes of itching, intensity of bother, problem with sleep, impact on daily activities, and impact on mood or emotions. Each item is scored 0-4. The sum of the 6 item scores form the ADCT total score (range 0-24). A higher score indicates lower AD control. A score of ≥7 indicates that the patient is not in control. The threshold for meaningful within-person change is estimated to be 5 points.</description>

It consists of 10 questions assessing impact of skin diseases on different aspects of subject's QoL over the prior week. Each item is scored on a 4-point scale: 0 = not at all/not relevant; 1 = a little; 2 = a lot; and 3 = very much. Item scores (0 to 3) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 30.

    <description>The ADCT is a validated patient self-administered instrument designed to assess AD control status in adult and adolescent patients (12 years and older). Six AD symptoms and impacts are evaluated over the past week including overall severity of symptoms, days with intense episodes of itching, intensity of bother, problem with sleep, impact on daily activities, and impact on mood or emotions. Each item is scored 0-4. The sum of the 6 item scores form the ADCT total score (range 0-24). A higher score indicates lower AD control. A score of ≥7 indicates that the patient is not in control. The threshold for meaningful within-person change is estimated to be 5 points.</description>

    <description>The EASI is a validated measure used in clinical practice and clinical trials to assess the severity and extent of AD. Four AD disease characteristics (erythema, thickness [induration, papulation, edema], scratching [excoriation], and lichenification) are each assessed for severity by the investigator on a scale of &quot;0&quot; (absent) through &quot;3&quot; (severe). In addition, the area of AD involvement is assessed as a percentage by body area of head, trunk (including the genital area), upper extremities, and lower extremities (including the buttocks), and converted to a score of 0 to 6. In each body region, the area is expressed as 0, 1 (1% to 9%), 2 (10% to 29%), 3 (30% to 49%), 4 (50% to 69%), 5 (70% to 89%), or 6 (90% to 100%).

For purposes of clinical estimation, the total surface of the palm plus five digits is assumed to be approximately equivalent to 1%. Measurement of the total area of involvement by the investigator is aided by imagining if scattered plaques were moved so that they were next to each other and then estimating the total area involved. Published score bands: 0% (clear), 0.1-15.9% (mild), 16.0-39.9% (moderate), 40-100% (severe).</description>

Item scores (0 to 4) are added to provide a total score range of 0 to 28. The total score reflects disease-related morbidity, and differentiates between &quot;clear/almost clear&quot; (0-2 points), &quot;mild&quot; (3-7 points), &quot;moderate&quot; (8-16 points), &quot;severe&quot; (17-24 points) and &quot;very severe&quot; (25-28 points) AD.

    <description>The Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Index for Atopic Dermatitis (WPAI-AD) is a validated instrument used to measure loss of productivity at work and impairment in daily activities over the past 7 days. The questionnaire includes four items: absenteeism, presenteeism, overall work impairment, and activity impairment, that range from 0% to 100%, with higher values indicating greater impairment. While absenteeism represents the percentage of work time missed due to AD, presenteeism represents the percentage of impairment while at work due to AD. Overall work impairment represents the total percentage of work time missed due to either absenteeism or presenteeism (since those are mutually exclusive). Activity impairment represents the percentage of impairment during daily activities other than work. The 4 items are all evaluated using an 11-point Likert-type scale from 0 (no effect) to 10 (completely prevented), and the scores are multiplied by ten to arrive at a percentage.</description>
