  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      We aimed to divide the healthy individuals aged between 18-45 years, included in our study,&#xD;
      into three groups as bilateral, unilateral-right and unilateral-left Auricular Vagus Nerve&#xD;
      Stimulation (VSS). We planned to examine the effects of vagal nerve stimulation applied to&#xD;
      each group with superficial EMG and EEG measurements before and after.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auricular vagus nerve stimulation has effects on cerebral activity. Therefore, this effect&#xD;
      will be evaluated with EEG. In addition, whether there is a secondary peripheral effect will&#xD;
      be examined by EMG method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes to be detected in EEG and EMG in healthy individuals may give an idea about the use&#xD;
      of auricular vagus nerve stimulation in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In our study, healthy individuals between the ages of 18-45, who do not have any chronic&#xD;
      diseases and who do not have to use any medication regularly will be included in all three&#xD;
      groups. Due to the superficial EMG measurement method we used, those who have orthopedic&#xD;
      problems in the upper extremity (shoulder, elbow, wrist and fingers) or have a history of&#xD;
      surgical operation in the upper extremity, however, any systemic disease such as diabetes,&#xD;
      gout, chronic kidney failure, rheumatoid arthritis, thyroid diseases individuals will be&#xD;
      excluded from the study in all three groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Superficial EMG measurement will be made with BIOPAC EMG (Biopac systems, Santa Barbara, CA,&#xD;
      USA). Dominant and non-dominant wrist extensor muscle electromyography will be performed with&#xD;
      the BIOPAC (Biopac Systems, Santa Barbara, CA, USA) electromyography device and hand grip&#xD;
      strength wiil be measured simultaneously with the hand dynamometer of the same device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single channel will be used for electromyography measurement , which was taken via surface&#xD;
      electrodes (Ag-Cl) over the extensor wrist muscle; the ulnar styloid process will be selected&#xD;
      for the ground electrode. Electrodes on the muscle will be placed about 0.5 cm apart. The&#xD;
      measurement will be taken in the standard measurement position of the hand dynamometer, with&#xD;
      0° shoulder flexion, 0° shoulder abduction, 90° elbow flexion and forearm in the midline&#xD;
      position, in the sitting position, during for 5 seconds of maximum grip.The measurement will&#xD;
      be repeated 3 times and root mean square (RMS) calculations will be made with the MATLAB&#xD;
      software.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bioelectrical activity of the brain will be measured with the EMOTIV EPOC+ EEG device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Auricular Vagus Nerve Stimulation will be performed with a device called VAGUSTIM. Auricular&#xD;
      Vagus Nerve Stimulation will be performed for 20 minutes with a frequency of 10 Hz and a&#xD;
      pulse width of 300 µs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We are planning to examine the effects of vagal nerve stimulation, which we will apply to&#xD;
      each group using different methods, by examining the effects of vagal nerve stimulation&#xD;
      before and after the superficial EMG and EEG measurements as well as the first test and post&#xD;
      test measurement in each group, and at the same time, we are planning to evaluate the results&#xD;
      we obtained by comparing the results between the groups in all three groups.&#xD;
