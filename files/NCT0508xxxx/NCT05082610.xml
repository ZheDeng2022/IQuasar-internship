      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center, first-in-human, two-stage (Part 1: dose&#xD;
      escalation and Part 2: dose expansion) study evaluating multiple doses and schedules of&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) administered HMBD-002, with or without pembrolizumab, in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors (i.e., locally advanced and unresectable, or metastatic).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center study whose principal phase 1 stage objective&#xD;
      is to determine the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of the anti-VISTA monoclonal antibody&#xD;
      (mAb) as a single agent and combined with the anti-PD-1 mAb pembrolizumab in subjects with&#xD;
      advanced solid malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the phase 2 stage, the antitumor activity of HMBD-002 alone or combined with pembrolizumab&#xD;
      will be evaluated in patients with triple negative breast cancer (TNBC), non-small cell lung&#xD;
      cancer (NSCLC) and a wide range of other malignancies known or documented to express VISTA.&#xD;
