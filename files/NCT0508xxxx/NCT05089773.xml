  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transposition of the great arteries (TGA) is a complex cyanotic congenital heart disease and&#xD;
      patients suffer from a high mortality rate within one year of age without appropriate&#xD;
      management. The therapeutic effect of arterial switch operation (ASO) is satisfactory with&#xD;
      low surgery mortality of 2-5%, and thus, has become the treatment of choice for surgical&#xD;
      correction of d-TGA. Outcomes of ASO in TGA in china are rare. This is a retrospective study&#xD;
      reporting the outcomes of ASO in TGA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transposition of the Great Arteries (TGA) is a relatively rare congenital heart disease and&#xD;
      surgical treatment in China was developed in recent 20 years. The outcomes of arterial switch&#xD;
      operation (ASO) in TGA in China have not been reported before. This study was designed to&#xD;
      offer the experience of surgical treatment of TGA in two major pediatric heart centers&#xD;
      affiliated in national children's medical center in China. In this retrospective study, a&#xD;
      total of 1281 patients diagnosed with TGA received ASO treatment in Fudan Children's Hospital&#xD;
      and Shanghai Children's Medical Center were recruited. Medical records and follow-up data of&#xD;
      patients were complete. Patient characteristics and clinical data were obtained through&#xD;
      review of the medical records, preoperative echocardiography and cardiac catheterization&#xD;
      data, operative notes, and follow up reports. Description of the anatomy was confirmed on the&#xD;
      preoperative echocardiogram, with clarification from the operative note as needed. Anatomy of&#xD;
      the coronary arteries were collected based on the surgical notes. Perioperative data included&#xD;
      aorta cross clamping time, cardiopulmonary bypass time and the application of Lecompete&#xD;
      maneuver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Early postoperative complications are defined as delayed sternal closure, active bleeding&#xD;
      after surgery, pulmonary artery stenosis, coronary artery re-transplantation, residual&#xD;
      ventricular septal defect with significant shunt, atrioventricular block, extracorporeal&#xD;
      membrane oxygenation support, cardiac arrest, necrotizing enterocolitis and diaphragmatic&#xD;
      eventration. Hospital death was defined as death occurred before discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up results included echocardiography, cardiac CTA, cardiac catheterization, and&#xD;
      angiography. Echocardiographic assessment included color, continuous wave, and pulse wave&#xD;
      Doppler date for all valves. Peak pressure gradient of 20mmHg was considered to be stenotic&#xD;
      for neoaortic and pulmonary valve. Redo-procedure was defined as any kind of cardiovascular&#xD;
      intervention after the ASO procedure including surgery or catheter-based procedure. The&#xD;
      indication for reintervention of pulmonary or suprapulmonary stenosis was peak pressure&#xD;
      gradient over 40mmHg. Pressure gradient across the LVOT or aortic valve over 50 mmHg was the&#xD;
      indication for reintervention. Late death was defined as death occurred during follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationships between preoperative and perioperative factors and hospital mortality were&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

    <description>The ASO is a procedure that emerged as an anatomically as well as physiologically appropriate solution to the transposition of the great arteries. The aorta and pulmonary artery are detached from their native roots and reattached to the opposite root; thus, the pulmonary root becomes the neo-aorta, and the aortic root becomes the neo-pulmonary artery.&#xD;
The coronary arteries are transplanted from the aorta/neo-pulmonary artery to the pulmonary artery/neo-aorta.</description>
