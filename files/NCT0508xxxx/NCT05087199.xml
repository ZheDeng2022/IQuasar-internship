      This study aims to assess the clinical presentation, radiological patterns and outcome of&#xD;
      COVID-19 infection in patients with chronic pulmonary disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inter-relationship between the severity of COVID-19 infection and chronic pulmonary diseases.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The COVID-19 pandemic has led to many difficulties with the diagnosis and routine management&#xD;
      of chronic pulmonary diseases such as COPD, Bronchial asthma, ILD and Bronchiectasis as well&#xD;
      as raising concerns about the management and outcomes for patients with these diseases who&#xD;
      develop COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although there is conflicting evidence on whether patients with chronic respiratory diseases&#xD;
      are more susceptible to COVID-19, these patients exhibit a more severe presentation and&#xD;
      higher mortality compared with those without chronic respiratory diseases.&#xD;
