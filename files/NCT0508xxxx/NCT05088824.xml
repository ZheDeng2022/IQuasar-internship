  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One of the most significant subjects studied in abdominal wall surgery is inguinal hernia.&#xD;
      Its management is very codified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main factors evaluating efficient hernia surgery are not only the rate of complications&#xD;
      (recurrence and groin pain essentially) but also cost and time to return to normal&#xD;
      activities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Desarda technique is a non-mesh technique described first in 2001. This surgical technique&#xD;
      uses a flap of external oblique aponeurosis in place of a mesh. Its singularity remains its&#xD;
      low cost, no use of mesh, and less extensive dissection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mesh repair has its own limitations; it is unphysiological as mesh is used. Chronic inguinal&#xD;
      pain, seroma formation, foreign body sensation, risk of mesh infection are common&#xD;
      complications and not recommended in strangulated hernias and extra cost involved by the mesh&#xD;
      itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It involves use of undetached strip of external oblique aponeurosis to strengthen the&#xD;
      posterior wall of the inguinal canal which is based on the physiological principles. This is&#xD;
      a physiological repair and is tension free, can be used in strangulated hernia. Recurrence&#xD;
      and complication rates equal to or less than Lichtenstein's repair. It's a simple procedure,&#xD;
      early ambulation and less time of hospital stay, low cost for the patient as mesh is not used&#xD;
      and most importantly no question of mesh related complications such as mesh rejection,&#xD;
      infection, migration and foreign body sensation and chronic groin pain which is comparatively&#xD;
      low in this procedure.&#xD;

        A prospective clinical trial will be conducted on 30 patients diagnosed with oblique&#xD;
        inguinal hernia . The study population will go for hernia repair by Desarda technique .&#xD;
&#xD;
        The treatment will be herniorrhaphy. All the patients will be followed up after the 1st&#xD;
        week, 1st month, 3 month and after 6 month . The efficacy and adverse effects will be&#xD;
        compared by statistical analysis.&#xD;
