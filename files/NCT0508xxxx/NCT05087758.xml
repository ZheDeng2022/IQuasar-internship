  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, a novel placental membrane product Matrion™ (LifeNet Health, Inc., Virginia&#xD;
      Beach, VA) will be used as a treatment for subjects with diabetic foot ulcers. Matrion is&#xD;
      composed of placental membrane derived from donated human birth tissue containing both the&#xD;
      innermost amniotic layer and the outermost chorionic layer. Matrion is minimally processed&#xD;
      and disinfected using a proprietary decellularization technology that safely renders the&#xD;
      placental membrane acellular for its intended surgical applications.&#xD;
