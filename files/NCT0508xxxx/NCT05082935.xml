  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The global SARS-CoV-2 pandemic that causes the severe respiratory illness COVID-19 is the&#xD;
      worst health crisis that the United States has faced in a century. Although this highly&#xD;
      contagious virus has infected millions of Americans already, the disease burdens are&#xD;
      disproportionately born by historically underserved populations such as Latinx communities.&#xD;
      In Oregon, 13% of the population that is Latinx represents approximately 25.7% of COVID-19&#xD;
      cases and are burdened with more than twice the cases per 100,000 individuals compared to&#xD;
      non-Hispanic Oregonians (10,677 versus 4,616, respectively). Furthermore, only 54.9% of&#xD;
      eligible Latinx Oregonians are vaccinated compared to the 76.2% statewide vaccination rate.&#xD;
      An urgent need exists to reach Oregon's Latinx community to prevent SARS-CoV-2 transmission&#xD;
      and increase vaccine acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this study is to implement a Promotores de Salud behavioral health&#xD;
      intervention to increase the reach, access, uptake, and impact of testing and vaccination in&#xD;
      Latinx communities in Oregon. This project will fully integrate with the National institutes&#xD;
      of Health (NIH) Rapid Acceleration of Diagnostics (RADx) consortium and its Coordination and&#xD;
      Data Collection Center (CDCC). The study team will add testing venues based on feedback from&#xD;
      the Oregon Health Authority (OHA) and our county and community partners to test if a&#xD;
      &quot;partner-optimized venue placement strategy&quot; yields more Latinx individuals tested than&#xD;
      placement of sites based upon residential density used in the ongoing testing in Phase I of&#xD;
      this study (Clinical Trial ID: NCT04793464). In addition, evaluation of the Promotores de&#xD;
      Salud intervention held during testing events will test whether culturally competent&#xD;
      education results in greater use of strategies that reduce transmission of COVID-19 at the&#xD;
      community and individual level and increases the number of individuals who choose to be&#xD;
      vaccinated, as a function of fidelity of the intervention. Over time, this project will help&#xD;
      communities institutionalize optimal local testing frameworks supported by University of&#xD;
      Oregon laboratory facilities for testing capacity, technical support for testing logistics,&#xD;
      and collection of data on health behaviors, testing rates, and sustainability. The resulting&#xD;
      structures and systems will be poised for future scale-up to other vulnerable communities&#xD;
      and/or for other public health purposes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will test, compare, and determine if targeted placement of testing events at&#xD;
      venues identified each month as viable by the Oregon Health Authority, Community Based&#xD;
      Organizations, and our community partners (&quot;partner-optimized venue placement strategy&quot;) will&#xD;
      increase the number of Latinx individuals who get tested. All testing events will receive the&#xD;
      Promotores de Salud intervention, which includes Spanish/English bilingual community health&#xD;
      workers (i.e., promotores) from the local communities delivering health information to&#xD;
      everyone attending testing events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Promotores will deliver the Promotores de Salud intervention and promote strategies that are&#xD;
      effective in mitigating the spread of COVID-19. They will also emphasize the continued&#xD;
      importance of preventive strategies given the increasing availability of vaccines and&#xD;
      addressing vaccine hesitancy. This health information will be shared at testing events via&#xD;
      brief verbal interactions and printed materials (i.e., brochures and infographics). The&#xD;
      intervention will also specifically address logistical challenges associated with vaccination&#xD;
      uptake (e.g., lack of transportation, language barriers, and difficulty locating vaccination&#xD;
      opportunities), which are additional factors driving vaccine hesitancy among Latinx&#xD;
      communities. The Promotores de Salud intervention was designed to build relationships with&#xD;
      Latinx community members and facilitate trust.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the proportion of Latinx community members tested at each site, the investigators&#xD;
      will use de-identified health information from a patient registry provided to the study by&#xD;
      the University of Oregon's (UO) COVID-19 clinical genomics laboratory, who are processing the&#xD;
      tests. The investigators anticipate engaging a greater proportion of Latinx community&#xD;
      members, relative to overall county demographics, at the testing events. The investigators&#xD;
      also expect to enroll more proportionally more Latinx individuals as these events, relative&#xD;
      to Phase I events. The overall study population is expected to be 75% Hispanic and 25%&#xD;
      non-Hispanic, with 87% of individuals identifying as White in both ethnic groups and the&#xD;
      remaining 13% identifying as African American, Asian, Pacific Islander, American&#xD;
      Indian/Alaska Native, or more than one race. The investigators anticipate testing&#xD;
      approximately 100 people per month, across 11 months and 24 events, for a total of 1,100&#xD;
      individuals tested. To assess health behaviors, a subset of adult participants at each&#xD;
      testing event will be invited to participate in a research survey, administered at testing&#xD;
      (baseline) and again 30 days later (T2). Of the 1,100 individuals tested, the team&#xD;
      anticipates that 50% will choose to participate in the research survey for a total of 550&#xD;
      individual participants. Survey data from baseline to T2 will be used to examine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the promotores intervention, as a function of intervention fidelity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quality Assurance, Data Checks, Source Data Verification, Data Dictionary, and Standard&#xD;
      Operating Procedures: Data and biospecimens will be collected in-person at testing sites,&#xD;
      requiring direct interaction with participants. In order to report SARS-CoV-2 infection&#xD;
      results back to each participant, name, date of birth, and contact information are collected.&#xD;
      To fulfill reporting requirements to the Oregon Health Authority, county of residence and zip&#xD;
      code are also collected for each person tested. Data used to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      intervention will involve aggregate variables derived from data collected as part of the&#xD;
      diagnostic testing procedure and will be aggregated at the level of the testing site (e.g.,&#xD;
      tests performed, race and ethnicity percentages, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the collection of SARS-CoV-2 samples, testing facilitators will guide participants in the&#xD;
      self-collection process. For anterior nares, participants are instructed to place the nasal&#xD;
      swab about 1cm into their nostril and rotate it, making contact with the nasal membrane for&#xD;
      10 seconds, then repeating the process with the same swab in the other nostril. Testing site&#xD;
      staff can assist participants who have low dexterity or physical impairments in sample&#xD;
      collection. In case of an injury during sample collection, the partnering community&#xD;
      organization staff will direct the participant to the appropriate medical resources. Samples&#xD;
      will be placed into sterile barcoded vials (1 ml Matrix, barcoded screw-cap tubes) that each&#xD;
      contain 500 microliters (μl) of DNA/RNA Shield. Each Matrix tube will then be closed tightly&#xD;
      and will be placed in a standard plastic laboratory microcentrifuge tube rack with eight rows&#xD;
      and twelve columns (8-by-12 rack with 96 positions). This rack will then be externally&#xD;
      decontaminated by brief submersion in accelerated hydrogen peroxide (H202). Each 96-position&#xD;
      microcentrifuge tube rack will then be labeled and placed in a sterile temporary container&#xD;
      with an icepack. At the end of the day all racks will be transported to the COVID-19 clinical&#xD;
      genomics Laboratory at UO, ensuring that they will arrive no longer than 48 hours after&#xD;
      collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each 96 well collection plate will next proceed to molecular processing using the standard,&#xD;
      FDA approved Thermo Fisher TaqPath or Diacarta Quantivirus analysis protocols, which are&#xD;
      similar nucleic acid amplification tests (NAAT). All steps of this approved protocol will be&#xD;
      followed exactly, including the appropriate reagents, volumes, inclusion of appropriate&#xD;
      positive and negative controls and the software analysis system and parameters. Hamilton&#xD;
      liquid handling robots (Hamilton, Microlab VANTAGE 2.0) are used to aliquot from 96 tube&#xD;
      matrix racks and for subsequent qPCR amplification. All laboratory assays and reporting will&#xD;
      be automated through the use of barcodes, robotics, 96 and 384 well qPCR machines, and the&#xD;
      use of a fully HIPAA and CAP3 compliant Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) built&#xD;
      by L7 informatics (https://l7informatics.com/), which organizes and relays information from&#xD;
      lab instruments to secure databases. The results for each sample, and associated metadata,&#xD;
      are then associated with each assigned barcode and can then be disseminated, as appropriate,&#xD;
      to the Oregon Health Authority, the appropriate county health department, and the individual.&#xD;
      Test results will be available within 48 hours and no later than 4 days to the individual&#xD;
      and/or the health authority. After testing occurs, researchers will have access to aggregate,&#xD;
      community-level (e.g., counts and prevalence rates), de-identified data prepared by the data&#xD;
      managers in collaboration with the UO's CLIA clinical genomics laboratory. The data will&#xD;
      include three protected health identifiers: site zip code, participant zip code, and testing&#xD;
      date. It will also include demographic data this is not protected health information such as&#xD;
      age range, race, and ethnicity. These data will be used to assess outreach activities aimed&#xD;
      at increasing participation of Latinx community members in SARS-COV-2 testing. The primary&#xD;
      outcome for this aspect of the study is site-level testing rates of Latinx individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Assessment, Plan for Missing Data, Statistical Analysis Plan: To test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that partner-optimized venue placement (Phase II) yields more Latinx individuals&#xD;
      tested than placement of sites based upon residential density (Phase I), analyses will employ&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness research approaches (CER) using a clustered quasi-experimental&#xD;
      comparison of our implementation outreach. These analyses comprise two study arms to compare&#xD;
      the number of Latinx tested between top-performing Phase I sites (census geo-located venue&#xD;
      placement) contrasted with Phase II (partner-optimized venue placement). The primary outcome&#xD;
      for partner-optimized venue placement will be the number of Latinx tested specified as a&#xD;
      generalized linear multilevel count of test samples collected, nesting events over time&#xD;
      within site locations. To address internal validity threats to the quasi-experimental design,&#xD;
      study investigators will employ propensity score matching procedures for all pooled data&#xD;
      analyses comparing the two conditions. Primary analyses are powered to detect medium effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the hypothesis that accurate and culturally tailored information delivered by&#xD;
      promotores at testing events will result in individual level outcomes, study investigators&#xD;
      will evaluate whether implementation fidelity of the Promotores de Salud health intervention&#xD;
      will improve testing, reduce vaccination hesitancy, and increase vaccine acceptance and&#xD;
      improve health literacy. Social determinants of testing and vaccination analyses will focus&#xD;
      on the contextual determinants of pre-post change in the likelihood of vaccination, repeated&#xD;
      testing for those unvaccinated, and reduced vaccine hesitancy. Analyses will focus on&#xD;
      within-intervention group pre-post change specified as linear mixed models for vaccine&#xD;
      hesitancy and generalized linear mixed models for testing counts and vaccine acceptance.&#xD;
      These analyses are powered to detect small to moderate effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two primary sources of missing data are expected, item non-response and attrition over time.&#xD;
      For dropout, investigators will conduct standard attrition analyses to compare baseline&#xD;
      characteristics between attriters and completers. They will consider propensity score&#xD;
      matching procedures and complier average causal effects models to address substantial&#xD;
      differences. For item non-response and scale score development, investigators will require&#xD;
      70% of scale items be present for scoring. They will test whether scale level data are&#xD;
      missing completely at random (MCAR) within waves and then across waves. If data are not MCAR,&#xD;
      under assumptions of missing at random (MAR, i.e., data are not dependent on missing values&#xD;
      of the intervention response variable), investigators will employ one of two recommended&#xD;
      approaches for SEM, full information maximum likelihood (FIML) or multiple imputation (MI).&#xD;
      Although these approaches can be problematic when data are non-ignorable missing, they are&#xD;
      still recommended for handling missingness, particularly with covariates associated with&#xD;
      attrition. Both methods provide more efficient standard errors than listwise or pairwise&#xD;
      deletion, or mean substitution. Should missing data or attrition be associated with&#xD;
      covariates, investigators will include appropriate covariates in hypothesis testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, data will be collected in accordance with Tier 1 &quot;common data elements&quot; from the&#xD;
      national Duke Coordination and Data Collection Center (CDCC). The CDCC directly assists each&#xD;
      individual RADx-UP project to optimize engagement, outreach, testing strategies, and to&#xD;
      facilitate co-learning opportunities between and among RADx-UP projects. Key outcome data and&#xD;
      the testing procedures for obtaining the sample, analysis platform, analysis procedures, and&#xD;
      test resulting will be collected and represented in a consistent manner for harmonization&#xD;
      across the consortium, integrated with test reporting requirements under the Coronavirus Aid,&#xD;
      Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act).&#xD;
