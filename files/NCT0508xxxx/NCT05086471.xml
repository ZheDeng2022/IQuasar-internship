      This study uses a comparative method to evaluate the performance of the NaviCam SB capsule&#xD;
      endoscope system in comparison to the PillCam SB3 capsule system for the diagnosis of small&#xD;
      bowel diseases.&#xD;

      This study adopts a prospective and self-controlled design. The subjects are adult patients&#xD;
      (≥18 years old) who have symptoms of small bowel disease or suspected GI bleeding; Subjects&#xD;
      swallow two types of SB capsules approximately 40 minutes apart in a randomized order. During&#xD;
      the capsule endoscopy, the doctor can view the small bowel images taken by the capsules in&#xD;
      real time. This study adopts a method of independent image reading in the participating&#xD;
      centers. Two physicians of digestive endoscopy respectively review the images captured by the&#xD;
      experimental capsule and the control capsule for normal versus abnormal findings, type of&#xD;
      findings and categorization (lesions, polyps, bleeding, etc.), capsule transit time, reading&#xD;
      time, and image quality.&#xD;
