  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients 1 to 8 years of age, American Society of Anesthesiologist score 1 and 2, planned for&#xD;
      elective, one day surgery: inguinal hernia repair, hydrocele surgery, testis retention&#xD;
      surgery, varicocele and phimosis surgery, and parents or legal guardians will be asked to&#xD;
      sign written informed consent for participation in the study. Exclusion criteria will be:&#xD;
      confirmed propofol allergies, mitochondrial disease, disease of lipid and carbohydrate&#xD;
      metabolism, neurological disorders, treated psychiatric comorbidities, hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be randomly assigned to two groups: one in which manually controlled&#xD;
      propofol infusion will be used (MC group) and the other with target controlled infusion (TC&#xD;
      group). After anesthesia induction depth of anesthesia during surgery will be measured using&#xD;
      bispectral index (BIS), continuously. As a part of routine monitoring noninvasive blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring will be measured, and recorded in three time points, as well as heart&#xD;
      rate. Time will be measured from the moment when propofol infusion was stopped till tracheal&#xD;
      extubating.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Prospective, randomized controlled study will be done at the University Children's Clinic.&#xD;
      For the study ethical board approval was requested. Pediatric patients, planned for elective,&#xD;
      one day surgery, requiring intubation with signed informed consent will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to two groups First in which manually controlled propofol infusion will be used (MC group)&#xD;
      and the other with target controlled infusion (TC group).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be premedicated half an hour before anesthesia induction with midazolam&#xD;
      orally in dose of 0.5mg/kg body weight. Intravenous cannula will be placed 20-30 minutes&#xD;
      later, and participants will receive atropine in dose of 0,02mg/kg intravenously, and&#xD;
      fentanyl 1mcg/kg intravenously. In the MC group participants will receive propofol bolus&#xD;
      2.5-3 mg/kg, for anesthesia induction and anesthesia maintenance will be done according to&#xD;
      the Mc Farlan scheme. In TC group Pedfusor model will be used, with target concentration for&#xD;
      anesthesia induction of 4 mcg/kg body weight and anesthesia maintenance of 3 mcg/kg. In all&#xD;
      participants remifentanil in dose of 0.4mcg/kg/min will be used as analgesic, and&#xD;
      cisatracurium 0.15mg/kg was muscle relaxant, for anesthesia induction. At the end of surgery,&#xD;
      before remifentanil infusion is stopped, all patients will receive 0.5 mg/kg of ketorolac. If&#xD;
      BIS values are out of the40-60 range during anesthesia, in MC group infusion rate will be&#xD;
      changed and in TC group set plasma concentration (Cp) will be corrected. In case of heart&#xD;
      rate increase or decrease for more than 20% compared to initial values, speed of remifentanil&#xD;
      infusion will be decreased or increased, respectively. All participants will have standard&#xD;
      monitoring during anesthesia: percutaneous saturation, end tidal concentration of carbon&#xD;
      dioxide measurement, three channel electrocardiography, noninvasive blood pressure&#xD;
      monitoring, and continuous BIS measurement. Propofol infusion will be stopped 5 minutes&#xD;
      before expected end of surgery, and remifentanil infusion will be stopped at the end of&#xD;
      surgery. Time will be measured from the moment when propofol infusion was stopped till&#xD;
      tracheal extubating.&#xD;
