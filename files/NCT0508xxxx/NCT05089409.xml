  <brief_summary>

      The study is designed to evaluate the Safety, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of ATB1651 in&#xD;
      participants with mild to moderate onychomycosis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Onychomycosis (also known as tinea unguium) is a contagious infection of toe nails by fungal&#xD;
      organisms including dermatophytes, yeast, and molds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is phase 1, first in human, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, MAD study&#xD;
      designed to assess the safety, tolerability, and PK of ATB1651 when administered in&#xD;
      participants with mild to moderate onychomycosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study consists of 2 parts. In both parts, participants will receive multiple doses of&#xD;
      ATB1651 applied to 1 affected great toenail and the remaining toenails (affected or not)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A: Participants will be enrolled into 1 of 3 cohorts and randomized to receive either&#xD;
      ATB1651 or placebo at a ratio of 2:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 2 additional cohorts may be added at the discretion of the Sponsor and Safety&#xD;
      Monitoring Committee, if deemed necessary&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B: Participants will be randomized within a single cohort to receive either ATB1651 or&#xD;
      placebo at a ratio of 4:1&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 18 participants enrolled in part A, 30 participants in part B&#xD;

             both) affected great toenail(s) as determined by visual inspection after the nail has&#xD;
             been trimmed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. The combined thickness of the distal nail plate at the associated hyperkeratotic nail&#xD;
             bed is less than 3 mm.&#xD;
