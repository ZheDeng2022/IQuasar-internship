    <description>Patients will perform two PET-MRI scans: (1) during cluster period and (2) during pain-free remission period. Scans during cluster periods will aim to acquire data before, during and after crisis. Sumatriptan 6mg will be injected subcutaneously under PET-MRI camera to relieve patient pain.</description>

    <description>Patients will performed PET-MRI scans. A first 30 minutes acquisition will be performed at time=60min after injection. A second 75 minutes acquisition will be performed at time=150min. Each scans will contain functional dynamic [18F]F13640 PET acquisition, anatomical and functional MRI images acquisition and pain evaluation using a score visual analogic scale.</description>
