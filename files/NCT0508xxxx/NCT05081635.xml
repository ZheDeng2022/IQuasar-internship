  <brief_summary>

      The objective of this study is to generate expert consensus statements on the definitions of&#xD;
      success and failure and its influencing factors in Post-graduate medical education.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A study will be performed using a e-Delphi process with Portuguese expert panel to generate&#xD;
      recommendation statements related to the definitions of success and failure in Post-graduate&#xD;
      medical education and its influencing factors and to determine the level of agreement for&#xD;
      each statement from the panel as a whole. The following topics will be covered:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Success in Post-graduate medical education: definition, influencing factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Failure in Post-graduate medical education: definition, influencing factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Management Consensus is achieved through iterative rounds of survey and revision to the&#xD;
           statements until a pre-determined level of agreement is met (75% agreement).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: planning and evidence review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Series of planning sessions with study investigators&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Literature is reviewed/summarized&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initial statements will be developed based on Round 1 results. Round 1 will be composed&#xD;
           of 4 open-ended questions&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Survey to achieve consensus&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Survey, based on the initial statements developed on Round 1 results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At least 2 additional rounds of review (remote rounds using an online platform) will be&#xD;
           held to achieve consensus on each topic of interest and finalize consensus statements&#xD;
