    <textblock>
      This is a single-group treatment, phase IV, open label study to assess the mobilization&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of plerixafor in combination with G- CSF in male and female participants&#xD;
      from 18 to 75 years of age with multiple myeloma for autologous transplantation. Study&#xD;
      Duration-Screening-up to 30-day. Intervention and CD34+cells apheresis up-to 8 day. A follow&#xD;
      up for 30 days (+7 days) post last dose of plerixafor, or the initiation of ablative&#xD;
      chemotherapy, or the first dose of G-CSF administration in rescue procedure, whichever occurs&#xD;
      earlier. Study duration up to 75 days. For treatment phase visit frequency daily.&#xD;
