  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, the non-communicable diseases are increasing at an alarming rate in which the&#xD;
      cardiovascular diseases and Diabetes Mellitus (DM) are predominantly common in lower middle&#xD;
      income countries. According to Center of Disease Control and Prevention, Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      (DM) is the 7th leading cause of mortality in United States that may leads to visual&#xD;
      deficits, limb amputations, and organ failure. The prevalence of diabetes in the last few&#xD;
      decades has increased along with obesity. According to World Health Organization (WHO) the&#xD;
      world wide prevalence of DM has increased up to 422 million people and out of this majority&#xD;
      lived in the low-and middle income countries. Almost 1.6 million of death is directly&#xD;
      attributed to diabetes. According to International Diabetic Foundation, by the end of 2040,&#xD;
      DM will affect up to 642 million of the world population. In Pakistan, WHO reported that 12.9&#xD;
      million patients (10% of the population) have diabetes, 9.4 million patients have diagnosed&#xD;
      diabetes, and 3.5 million have not been diagnosed. On the contrary, 38 million people have&#xD;
      prediabetes (20.5% women and 15.9% men). Another research has shown that Pakistan is ranked&#xD;
      on 7th out of 10 countries with Type II diabetes and will be 4th by 2030. Moreover, about&#xD;
      120,000 people in Pakistan have been reported to die each year as the result of type II&#xD;
      diabetes and relative complicated diseases. The keystone of diabetes management includes&#xD;
      pharmacological management and changes in the lifestyle that includes physical activity and&#xD;
      diet. Regular exercises not only improve the cardiovascular fitness but also help in&#xD;
      improving the regulation of blood glucose there by enhance insulin signaling, improved&#xD;
      vascular function and blood lipids, as well as reduced low-grade inflammation, and weight&#xD;
      loss. Researchers suggested that physical activity can boost insulin sensitivity for patients&#xD;
      with type II diabetes and help to reduce high blood glucose levels. During exercise, the&#xD;
      intake of oxygen can increase up to 20 times and is greatly increased in working muscles.&#xD;
      However, receptivity to perform exercises among general population is poor; mainly due to&#xD;
      substantial commitment of time associated in performing these exercises. As a passive&#xD;
      interference, therefore, Whole-body vibration (WBV) was introduced. Vibration training&#xD;
      elevates, energy utilization and increases the blood flow of periphery. Hence the current&#xD;
      study was focused on examining the effects of WBV on HbA1c and Fasting Blood Sugar (FBS) in&#xD;
      type II diabetic patients.&#xD;

      A double-blinded randomized controlled trial was conducted among type-II diabetic patients;&#xD;
      aged 40-70 years recruited between April 2019 to May 2020 using simple random sampling&#xD;
      technique's envelope method from a primary care center of Karachi. All the participants were&#xD;
      initially screened by two certified diabetes educators and certified health fitness&#xD;
      programmers. Participants were given informed consent prior to intervention, their voluntary&#xD;
      participation and understanding of the protocol was ensured prior to the commencement of&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who met the inclusion criteria were assigned by computer-generated number into&#xD;
      two groups A and B (n=15) in each group. Group A was provided with Whole Body Vibration (WBV)&#xD;
      for twelve weeks whereas Group B (control group) was instructed to continue their medications&#xD;
      and dietary plan. The outcome measure of the study was FBS and HbA1c.&#xD;

    <description>The study protocol of WBV includes twelve weeks of whole-body vibration training provided to the Type 2 diabetic patients. It was recommended to all participants that they follow their regular diet and medication during the training. Two sets of six 1-minute vibration squats were designed with 20 seconds of rest, 3 times weekly for a duration 12 weeks (total workout time 36 minutes a week), using a vertical vibration machine. The six static positions consisted of (a) a deep squat position (knee angle 900) (b) an elevated squat position (knee angle 1250) (c) an elevated squat position (with elevated heels) (d) a slight knee flexion1 (hand straps with shoulder bending) (e) a slight knee flexion (hand straps with shoulder abduction) and (f) a slight knee flexion 3 (hand straps with elbow flexion). The training load steadily increased from the initial vibration of 30 Hz and the platform amplitude was raised from 2 mm at week 1 to 40 Hz and from 4 mm at week 5 to the completion of training.</description>
