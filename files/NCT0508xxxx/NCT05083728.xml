  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The data of calibrated CT-scans will be used for the Finite Element Analysis (FEA) analysis&#xD;
      for SMR Short Stem in identified hospitals in EU and US as developers of the project and for&#xD;
      further research, upon subject acceptance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In particular, the Quantitative Computer Tomography (QTC)/Finite Element Analysis (FEA) model&#xD;
      of the assembly consisting of the shoulder and the orthopaedic implant allows detailed&#xD;
      analyses including:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  assessment of micromotion at the bone-implant interface, to predict osseointegration;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  comparison of strains/stresses between the intact bone tissue and the bone with the&#xD;
           implant in order to predict the stress shielding phenomenon.&#xD;

    <time_frame>&lt;24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>To perform the Finite Element Analysis (FEA), the following data will be requested:&#xD;
Shoulder calibrated CT-scan&#xD;
Date of calibrated CT-scan execution&#xD;
Subject's year of birth&#xD;
Subject's sex&#xD;
Subject's weight&#xD;
Subject's height&#xD;
Subject's ethnicity</description>

    <description>Clinicians are free to choose the adult subjects in whom a non-contrast calibrated CT-scan will be performed as a part of routine clinical care. The decision to order a noncontrast CT-scan of the shoulder must be made prior to, and independently from, the decision to enroll the patient.</description>

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        The eligible patient population for this study will include all patients who require a&#xD;
        noncontrast CT as a part of their clinical care. The effective number of cases included&#xD;
        will depend on the availability and quality of calibrated CT-scan imaging data necessary to&#xD;
        perform FEA as detailed in the selection criteria.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Subjects (males and/or females) must be â‰¥ 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Subjects are willing and able to provide written informed consent for collection of&#xD;
             the data; if a patient has already completed and performed the calibrated CT-scans as&#xD;
             per standard clinical practice, the subject may be contacted to offer participation in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Adult patients who will undergo noncontrast CT scanning of the shoulder as part of&#xD;
             routine preoperative planning for shoulder arthroplasty will be eligible to&#xD;
             participate in the study and receive a calibrated CT scan of the shoulder. The&#xD;
             decision to undergo CT scan will be made independently of study participation; only&#xD;
             patients who require a CT scan of the shoulder for clinically necessary reasons are&#xD;
             eligible to participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Pregnancy or lactation; 2. Subjects who have fracture of the affected shoulder; 3.&#xD;
             Subjects who have had prior surgery on the affected shoulder that resulted in metal&#xD;
             implants, including but not limited to:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Partial or total shoulder joint replacement;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Open reduction internal fixation of fracture;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior rotator cuff repair with metal implants; 4. Local or systemic infection; 5.&#xD;
             Persistent acute or chronic osteomyelitis; 6. Focal vascular or neurologic diseases&#xD;
             affecting the concerned limb; 7. Metabolic disorders or systemic diseases that&#xD;
             substantially affect bone quality, including the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Renal osteodystrophy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Osteoporosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Osteomalacia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Osteopetrosis 8. Bone tumors involving the shoulder girdle; 9. Local or disseminated&#xD;
             neoplastic diseases; 10. Severe deformity including malunion, nonunion, excessive bone&#xD;
             loss that would result in improper virtual implant positioning;&#xD;
