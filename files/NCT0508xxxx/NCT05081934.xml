  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Substance abuse and criminal behavior are increasing among adolescents in Sweden. The Swedish&#xD;
      National Board of Institutional Care, SiS, provides institutional care on basis of the&#xD;
      Swedish laws Care of Young Persons (Special Provisions) Act, LVU, Care of Substance Abusers&#xD;
      (Special Provisions) Act, LVM, Secure Youth Care Act, LSU. Treatment is provided at locked&#xD;
      youth residential homes. The Adolescent Community Reinforcement Approach, A-CRA, an&#xD;
      empirically supported substance use treatment, promotes long-term abstinence, increases&#xD;
      social stability and decreases depression and other co-morbid psychiatric problems. However,&#xD;
      A-CRA has mostly been delivered and evaluated within outpatient care. It is unclear whether&#xD;
      A-CRA is as effective when delivered in compulsory care where many adolescents with severe&#xD;
      substance use disorder and criminal behavior receive treatment. This study is the first part&#xD;
      of a larger project with the overall objective to evaluate and adjust A-CRA to the compulsory&#xD;
      care provided at National Board of Institutional Care (Statens institutionsstyrelse, SiS) for&#xD;
      justice-involved youth. The aim of this first part is to examine feasibility, acceptability&#xD;
      and preliminary effects of A-CRA when provided in institutional care (SiS). Furthermore, to&#xD;
      explore experiences of undergoing and delivering A-CRA in the institutional setting. Data&#xD;
      collected from this study will be used for improvement of a coming full scale randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial planned for 2022. Expected results are that A-CRA is feasible in the&#xD;
      institutional environment, that A-CRA is perceived as helpful and acceptable by therapists&#xD;
      and adolescents, that planned procedures are feasible and data collection and recruitment&#xD;
      works satisfactorily.&#xD;

      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability and&#xD;
      preliminary effects of the empirically supported treatment A-CRA when adjusted to, and&#xD;
      delivered in, the institutional care of SiS. Furthermore, to increase pro-social&#xD;
      behavior/attitudes and psychological flexibility, to improve mental health and to decrease&#xD;
      criminal behavior and substance abuse in youth suffering from substance use disorder and/or&#xD;
      disruptive behaviors. This study consists of a qualitative and a quantitative part 1)&#xD;
      semi-structured interviews with adolescents and therapists involved in treatment to explore&#xD;
      experiences 2) a pilot study to evaluate acceptability, feasibility and preliminary effects&#xD;
      of A-CRA. Treatment type and dose (number of sessions received and length of sessions) are&#xD;
      registered to enable future analyzes. Acceptability (perceived helpfulness and&#xD;
      comprehensibility) is measured using a 7-point Likert-scale, ranging from 1 (not at all&#xD;
      helpful) to 7 (very helpful).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents are randomized to either standard care alone or standard care with the addition&#xD;
      of A-CRA. Standard care is defined as the interventions and treatments adolescents are&#xD;
      usually offered and undergo in institutional care. These are Motivational Interviewing, MI,&#xD;
      Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, CBT, Aggression Replacement Therapy, ART or Acceptance and&#xD;
      Commitment Therapy, ACT. This will be further specified and registered in the initial phase&#xD;
      of the study, in collaboration with SiS. Randomization takes place at the individual level&#xD;
      with even allocation to the groups. Quantitative measurements take place before, during and&#xD;
      after treatment as well as follow up once a month for six months. Potential adverse events&#xD;
      will be collected after treatment completion using open questions.&#xD;

    <description>12-14 weekly sessions of A-CRA, a behavioral treatment for youth suffering from substance use disorder and co-occurring problems. The average time for a placement within SiS is for boys 5,9 months and for girls 4,5 months. To further adjust A-CRA to the closed institutional care, frequency of sessions may be increased to twice a week. This is to facilitate maintaining of focus in treatment and closely follow treatment progress. Treatment consists of 18 procedures that aim to reduce problematic behaviors and increase constructive behaviors. Example of procedures are functional analysis of substance use behavior, functional analysis of prosocial behavior, increasing prosocial activities, drink/drug refusal, relapse prevention, anger management and caregiver sessions. Procedures are combined and tailored to youth individual goals and needs.</description>
