  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Gonadal veins embolization (GVE) with nitinol or platinum coils is widely used in the&#xD;
      treatment of PeVD caused by the valvular incompetence of gonadal, parametrial, and uterine&#xD;
      veins. Most authors report a high efficacy of this technique in reducing blood flow through&#xD;
      the gonadal veins (GV) and relieving symptoms of the disease. In the Society for Vascular&#xD;
      Surgery (SVS) and American Venous Forum (AVF) guidelines, GVE is considered the standard of&#xD;
      treatment for PeVD with a grade of recommendation 2B, due to the moderate quality of&#xD;
      evidence. Moreover, other studies report about wide variability in the GVE outcomes, in terms&#xD;
      of pelvic venous pain (PVP) elimination, persistence or intensification of pain after GVE,&#xD;
      and coil migrations and protrusions. It is known that 6% to 32% of patients do not achieve&#xD;
      significant pain relief after the procedure. The most studies of GVE in the treatment of PeVD&#xD;
      are characterized by only a statement of the fact of any complication without investigating&#xD;
      the causes of its development. At the same time, it is well known that it is a thorough study&#xD;
      of complications that makes it possible to avoid failures in the future, to improve the&#xD;
      therapeutic technique, or to abandon its use altogether.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, it is planned to conduct a retrospective analysis of patients' database, who&#xD;
      have undergone gonadal veins embolization with nitinol coils.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to describe and study all side-effects and complications following&#xD;
      embolization of gonadal veins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective cohort study included 150 patients with PeVD who were treated by gonadal&#xD;
      veins coil embolisation at the Savelyev University Surgical Clinic of the Pirogov Russian&#xD;
      National Research Medical University in the period from 2000 to 2020. Patient informed&#xD;
      consent was not required due to the retrospective nature of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: the presence of symptoms and signs of PeVD (pelvic venous pain,&#xD;
      dyspareunia, discomfort/heaviness in the hypogastric region, vulvar varicosities); reflux in&#xD;
      the gonadal, parametrial, uterine veins according to duplex ultrasound and ovarian&#xD;
      venography; and gonadal veins coil embolization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: the presence of nutcracker and May-Thurner syndromes, confirmed by&#xD;
      multiplanar renal and pelvic venography; open, endoscopic, or hybrid interventions on the&#xD;
      gonadal and iliac veins or pelvic organs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of PeVD was verified by transvaginal and transabdominal DUS, multiplanar&#xD;
      computed tomographic venography, ovarian venography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients who have undergone embolization of gonadal veins with coils were collected in a&#xD;
      special database. The data includes parameters that can provoke complications, such as&#xD;
      weight, duration of surgery and hospitalization, pain level before and after procedures, and&#xD;
      others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gonadal vein embolization with coils:&#xD;
&#xD;
      GVE was performed under local anesthesia with 5.0-10.0 mL of 0.5% lidocaine solution with a&#xD;
      patient under intravenous sedation. For the left GV embolization, the transfemoral approach&#xD;
      was used, while for the right or both GV embolization, the transjugular approach was used.&#xD;
      The vein puncture was performed under ultrasound guidance. The 5F multipurpose angiographic&#xD;
      catheters (Cordis; USA), standard 'moving core' J .035&quot; guidewire, and an angled hydrophilic&#xD;
      guidewire (Radiofocus; Terumo Corp., Japan) were used. For the GV occlusion, the pushable&#xD;
      0.035&quot; standard stainless steel coils (Gianturco; William Cook, Bjæverskov, Denmark) and&#xD;
      0.035&quot; coils made of Inconel with interwoven long collagen fibrils (MReye; Cook Medical Inc.,&#xD;
      Bloomington, USA) were used. The diameter of coils was 8-12 mm, and the length was 10-20 cm.&#xD;
      When selecting the coil size, the principle of 20% coil oversizing relative to the GV&#xD;
      diameter was used in order to avoid coil migration in the conductive veins and pulmonary&#xD;
      artery. After embolization, the control ovarian venography was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of the gonadal vein embolization complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of GVE were graded according to the Society for Interventional Radiology (SIR)&#xD;
      Adverse Event Classification System as follows: A - No therapy, no consequences; B - Nominal&#xD;
      therapy, no consequence; includes overnight admission for observation only; C - Requires&#xD;
      therapy, minor hospitalization (&lt; 48 h); D - Requires major therapy, unplanned increase in&#xD;
      level of care, prolonged hospitalization (&gt; 48 h); E - Permanent adverse sequelae; F - Death.&#xD;
      Minor complications include classes A and B, and major complications include classes C to F.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Complications of gonadal vein embolization with coils included:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hematoma / bleeding at the access point;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thrombosis of non-targeted pelvic veins (parametric, uterine, internal iliac veins);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postembolization syndrome;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Protrusion of coils;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Migration of coils;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Allergic reactions to contrast agent or nickel. Complications of gonadal vein&#xD;
           embolization with coils were assessed within 1-30 days and 12 month after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Change in the diameter of the pelvic veins&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The diameter of the pelvic veins was measured using duplex ultrasound. [Time Frame: At&#xD;
           baseline and 1-12 months after pelvic vein intervention.]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Change in the duration of pelvic venous reflux Pelvic venous reflux was measured using&#xD;
           duplex ultrasound. Reflux duration of more than 1 s was considered pathological.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Time Frame: At baseline and 1-12 months after pelvic vein intervention.]&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Postprocedural pain The visual analogue scale is a line 10 cm long. Each centimeter&#xD;
      corresponds to 1 point: 0 points - no pain, 10 points - maximum pain. Higher scores on the&#xD;
      scale correspond to poorer results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      [Time Frame: 1 day, 5 days, 1 and 12 months after the intervention on the pelvic veins.] •&#xD;
      Pelvic vein thrombosis Pelvic vein thrombosis was detected using duplex ultrasound. [Time&#xD;
      Frame: 1 and 5 days after the intervention on the pelvic veins]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Pre-specified Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Complications of anesthesia Hematoma, vascular damage, pulmonary complications. [Time&#xD;
      Frame: 1 and 5 days after the intervention on the pelvic veins]&#xD;
