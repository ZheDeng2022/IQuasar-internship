      The study's objective is to assess whether CAM methods are feasible and beneficial in the&#xD;
      WSRH setting; to assess stress (using the Perceived Stress Scale-14 and using BioSquares™),&#xD;
      anxiety (using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale), depression (using the Patient&#xD;
      Health Questionnaire-9 scale), pain (using the Wong-Baker FACES scale), and vital signs using&#xD;
      a multidisciplinary complementary approach with Heartfulness Meditation, Conscious Breathing,&#xD;
      and Emotional Freedom Technique - the CAM practices for this study; and, to assess and&#xD;
      compare the above scores for each participant just prior to and immediately after each&#xD;
      treatment session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypothesizes that using CAM modalities in the WSRH is both feasible and beneficial&#xD;
      in that patient population; the patients receiving the CAM modalities of treatment will show&#xD;
      an improvement in the above-mentioned scores compared to participant scores prior to the&#xD;
      intervention; and there may also be an improvement in patients' vital signs following the&#xD;
      intervention of CAM practices.&#xD;

      Acute inpatient rehabilitation programs mainly focus on improving the physical wellbeing of&#xD;
      the patients with physical and occupational therapies. While these may also have an impact on&#xD;
      the mental and emotional wellbeing of the patients, there is not much available as therapies&#xD;
      for mental and emotional wellbeing in these patients. In this study, the investigators wish&#xD;
      to assess the impact of a structured CAM model practice for patients in rehabilitation&#xD;
      program. These services will be offered through trained professionals. Depression and&#xD;
      anxiety, stress, sleep, vital signs such as heart rate, blood pressure and pain scores will&#xD;
      be studied within the period of study.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study is a pilot designed to assess the quality of experience of patients measured through standardized assessment forms and objective parameters such as vital signs including blood pressure and heart rate. Participants will be compared with their own data for each intervention.&#xD;
This will be a prospective pilot pre-post study for the duration of eight weeks, or as long as required to obtain 30 participants. If, prior to the study, measurements of blood pressure and heart rate; pain scale ratings; and anxiety, depression and stress scale scores in patients show an overall improvement when compared to the same information taken after the completion of eight week weeks, then it can be concluded that these CAM methods are feasible and beneficial in the rehab setting.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Measurement of anxiety using the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 scale. The GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21, with 0 to 4 indicating minimal anxiety, 5 to 9 indicating mild anxiety, 10 to 14 indicating moderate anxiety, and 15 to 21 indicating severe anxiety</description>

    <description>Measurement of depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9. PHQ-9 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 27, with 1 to 4 indicating minimal depression, 5 to 9 indicating mild depression, 10 to 14 indicating moderate depression, 15 to 19 indicating moderately severe depression, and 20 to 27 indicating severe depression.</description>

    <description>Measurement of perceived stress using Perceived Stress Scale 14 can range from 0 to 40 with higher scores indicating higher perceived stress. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress; scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress; and scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>

Skin temperature will change the color of the square. Black is temperature of 79 degrees Fahrenheit and indicates tenseness. Red is temperature of 74 degrees Fahrenheit and indicates nervousness. Green is temperature of 87 degrees Fahrenheit and indicates calmness. Blue is temperature of 791 degrees Fahrenheit and indicates a relaxed state.</description>

    <description>During the Conscious Breathing session, participants will be asked to sit comfortably and with gently closed eyes.

    <description>During the Heartfulness Meditation session, participants will be asked to sit comfortably and with gently closed eyes. Starting with the feet and working towards the head, participants will be asked to relax each part of the body. Then participants will focus on the heart and imagine it filled with light and love. Participants will sit in this relaxed state for a few minutes to allow all stress and cares to be released.</description>

    <description>During the Emotional Freedom Technique session, participants will be asked to tap lightly on several acupressure points while saying a variety of statements regarding pain, anxiety, depression or stress. As participants tap on the acupressure points, participants will repeat phrases of affirmation and acceptance, and also talk through how pain, anxiety, depression or stress may cause distress but can learn to release these feelings. participants will be given a picture of where each of the acupressure points lie on the face, chest or head, and will also be given a script of what to say while tapping on each acupressure point. In addition, participants will be given a description of what each acupressure point &quot;means&quot; - its associated organ and what emotion that point helps to release.</description>
