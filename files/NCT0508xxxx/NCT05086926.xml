  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain on the lateral side of the hip is a common condition in general practice, however there&#xD;
      is limited evidence on how to best manage the condition. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the feasibility of a combined treatment before comparing this treatment in a larger&#xD;
      clinical trial. For the present study 20 patients with lateral hip pain will be invited to&#xD;
      receive a corticosteroid injection in the lateral hip prior to performing our exercise&#xD;
      program for 8 weeks. After 4 weeks we will do a short interview to get feedback on the&#xD;
      exercise program. After 8 weeks we will evaluate the acceptability of the combined treament.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral hip pain or greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS) is pain on the outside of the&#xD;
      hip due to tendon pathology of the hip abductor tendons. The incidence in primary care has&#xD;
      been reported to be 1.6-3.3 per 1000 patients per year. At present, there is no&#xD;
      evidence-based guidelines for the treatment of GTPS in primary care. The investigators of the&#xD;
      present study have developed an exercise protocol that is planned be evaluated in a future&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial in combination with a corticosteroid injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate feasibility of a home exercise program with the&#xD;
      addition of a corticosteroid injection in patients with GTPS in general practice. The primary&#xD;
      aim is to evaluate patient acceptability of 1) performing our exercise program 2) performing&#xD;
      exercises after receiving a corticosteroid injection. The secondary aim is to obtain feedback&#xD;
      from patients through qualitative interviews to be able to refine the exercise intervention&#xD;
      after the study is completed. If the combined treatment is found feasible, it is planned to&#xD;
      evaluate the effect in a large randomized controlled trial in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is a mixed methods feasibility study. The participants are patients with&#xD;
      GTPS that will receive a combined treatment of one corticosteroid injection in the lateral&#xD;
      hip and a home exercise program, which is to be performed for a period of eight weeks. The&#xD;
      acceptability of the combined intervention will be evaluated after 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RECRUITMENT OF PARTICIPANTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with GTPS will be recruited from general practice and a private rheumatology&#xD;
      practice. Patients will be considered for inclusion if they present to their practitioner&#xD;
      with self-reported lateral hip pain. The project manager will make a screening of eligibility&#xD;
      by telephone. Those not excluded based on this screening, will be invited to a clinical&#xD;
      examination where final eligibility is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ENDPOINTS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline is at the clinical examination. One week from baseline there will be a short phone&#xD;
      contact to the participants in order to clarify any questions related to the exercise&#xD;
      program. No data will be obtained at this point. At 4 weeks there will be a phone interview&#xD;
      which also serves as a booster session where the participants are encouraged to maintain&#xD;
      their exercise routine. At 8 weeks there will be a physical visit where the participants will&#xD;
      hand in their exercise diaries and complete the final questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRITERIA OF FEASIBILITY:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To conclude that the combined treatments are feasible, ≥ 75% of patients must rate the&#xD;
      treatment as 'acceptable'. If any participant drops out after the injection, they will be&#xD;
      dichotomized as &quot;not acceptable&quot;. A minimum of 15/20 training diaries must be handed in at&#xD;
      8-weeks follow-up. Based on the returned training diaries, ≥ 75% of participants need to&#xD;
      complete ≥ 20/28 possible training sessions. A training session will be considered completed&#xD;
      if the participant has performed at least one set of each exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case the combined treatments do not prove feasible according to this set of criteria, it&#xD;
      is planned to refine the intervention based on feedback from the interviews and evaluate with&#xD;
      a small group of patients for a shorter period of time.&#xD;

    <description>Corticosteroid injection:&#xD;
The project manager will give the participants one injection with cortisone and lidocaine in the lateral hip at baseline. The procedure will be performed aseptically.&#xD;
Home exercise program:&#xD;
The exercise programis based on previous literature and expert opinions that has been synthesized in a Delphi study conducted by our research group. The exercise program consists of three body weighted strength exercises, that are to be performed every second day for a period of 8 weeks. Exercise instructions will be available as a handout and online with video instructions. The corticosteroid injection usually causes a flare-up in pain with a duration of up to 48 hours. Participants will be instructed to begin the exercises as soon as possible after this flare-up has settled.</description>
