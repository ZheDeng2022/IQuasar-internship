  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate the bioavailability in fasting male and/or non-pregnant and non-&#xD;
      breast feeding female subjects of 1 capsule formulation containing Oseltamivir Phosphate 75&#xD;
      mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be performed at a single site with 36 subjects. Participants will take 1&#xD;
      capsule of the test product and reference product in 2 periods and 2 sequences (either test&#xD;
      after reference or reference after test). There will be a washout of at least 2 days between&#xD;
      each study period.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is to investigate the relative bioavailability of&#xD;
      Oseltamivir Phosphate 75 mg of 1 capsule formulations with Oseltamivir Phosphate 75 mg and to&#xD;
      demonstrate bioequivalence of both formulations in terms of rate and extent of absorption:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Test Product: Product manufactured by Laboratorios Silesia S.A.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Reference Product: Tamiflu [Trademark], product of Roche Pharma AG, Switzerland.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 90% confidence intervals for the intra-subject coefficient of variation (Test versus&#xD;
      Reference Product) for the main pharmacokinetic parameters area under the plasma&#xD;
      concentration-time curve from time zero to time t (AUC0 0-t) and from time zero to infinite&#xD;
      (AUC0 0-∞), and maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for total Oseltamivir Phosphate will be&#xD;
      determined. Participants will be confined in the study site for approximately 68 hours during&#xD;
      the entire study (for 10 hours pre-dosing and for 10 hours post dosing in period II) during&#xD;
      which pharmacokinetic (PK) blood samples will be obtained. 20 blood samples will be taken up&#xD;
      to 10 hours after the administration in each period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The washout period between the two study periods will be at least 2 days. The samples from&#xD;
      each participant will be analyzed with validated LC-MS/MS method for estimation of&#xD;
      Oseltamivir in plasma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety objective is to evaluate the tolerability of both formulations in subjects by&#xD;
      collecting adverse events.&#xD;
