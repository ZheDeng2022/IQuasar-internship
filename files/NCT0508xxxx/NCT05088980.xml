  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Aged appearance is often caused by an infraorbital hollowing, which is characterized as a&#xD;
      sunken appearance of the eye that results in the casting of a dark shadow over the nasal&#xD;
      lower eyelid, giving a fatigued appearance. This study will assess how safe and effective&#xD;
      JUVEDERM VOLBELLA with Lidocaine is in correcting infraorbital hollowing in adult&#xD;
      participants in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VOLBELLA with Lidocaine is an investigational product being developed for the correction of&#xD;
      infraorbital hollowing. Participants are randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups, called treatment&#xD;
      arms. Each group receives a different treatment. There is a 1 on 4 chance that participants&#xD;
      will be assigned to control group. Around 160 adult participants seeking correction of&#xD;
      infraorbital hollowing will be enrolled at approximately 6 sites across China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in treatment group will receive VOLBELLA with Lidocaine injections on Day 1 and&#xD;
      followed for 12 months. Participants in control group are followed for 3 months. Participants&#xD;
      in Control group can opt to receive VOLBELLA with Lidocaine injection after completion of 3&#xD;
      months and followed for 9 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There may be higher treatment burden for participants in this trial compared to their&#xD;
      standard of care. Participants will attend regular visits during the study at a hospital or&#xD;
      clinic. The effect of the treatment will be checked by medical assessments, blood tests,&#xD;
      checking for side effects and completing questionnaires.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants seeking improvement of infraorbital hollowing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has Moderate or Severe infraorbital hollowing for each eye as assessed by the&#xD;
             evaluating investigator (i.e., both eyes must qualify but do not need to have the same&#xD;
             score).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Treating Investigator (TI) considers the participant's anatomy to be amenable to&#xD;
             improvement to an Allergan Infraorbital Hollows Scale (AIHS) grade of 0 or 1 (None or&#xD;
             Minimal).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able, as assessed by the TI, and willing to follow study instructions (including&#xD;
             compliance with the safety diary) and likely to complete all required study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to complete effectiveness self-assessments without the use of glasses (contact&#xD;
             lens use is acceptable if they will be used for all participant self-assessments).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has experienced trauma to the infraorbital area within 12 months before enrollment or&#xD;
             has residual deficiencies, deformities, or scarring in the periorbital or cheek areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active or recurrent inflammation or infection in either eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has active autoimmune disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has history of anaphylaxis or allergy to lidocaine (or any amide-based anesthetics),&#xD;
             hyaluronic acid (HA) products, or Streptococcal protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has received botulinum toxin treatment above the subnasale within 9 months before&#xD;
             enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has changes in use of over-the-counter or prescription oral or topical, anti-wrinkle&#xD;
             products above the subnasale within 30 days before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current enrollment in an investigational drug or device study or participation in such&#xD;
             a study within 30 days of entry into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has tattoos, piercings, or scars that would interfere with visual assessment of the&#xD;
             infraorbital hollows.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  TI's discretion based on participant's safety and/or study integrity (the participant&#xD;
             has a condition or is in a situation that, in the TI's opinion, may put the&#xD;
             participant at significant risk, may confound the study results, or may interfere&#xD;
             significantly with the participant's participation in the study, such as clinically&#xD;
             significant abnormal lab testing results as judged by TI).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Directly or indirectly involved in the conduct and administration of this study as an&#xD;
             investigator, subinvestigator, study coordinator, or other study staff member;&#xD;

             residing with one of the above persons involved directly or indirectly in the study;&#xD;
             or enrolled in the study at another clinical site.&#xD;
