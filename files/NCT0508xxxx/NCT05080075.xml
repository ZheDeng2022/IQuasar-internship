      In this study, the investigators will be performing intra-articular platelet rich plasma&#xD;
      (PRP) injections for patients experiencing pain related to osteoarthritis of the knee. The&#xD;
      investigators will be following clinical outcomes, and how they relate to concentrations of&#xD;
      the PRP samples as well as following opioid and emergency room utilization pre and&#xD;
      post-injection.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Osteoarthritis is the most common form of arthritis and results in pain and stiffness in the&#xD;
      affected area and, depending on the joint, can lead to difficulty with mobility as well as&#xD;
      with performing basic activities of daily living. Conservative management of this condition&#xD;
      includes physical therapy, activity modification, bracing, medications, and corticosteroid&#xD;
      injections. When conservative treatment measures have failed, patients are often left with a&#xD;
      choice between surgery, specifically total knee arthroplasty, and long-term pain medications,&#xD;
      including opioid medications. In the midst of the opioid epidemic, physicians are seeking&#xD;
      non-opioid alternatives for treating pain when other conservative treatments have failed. One&#xD;
      such alternative treatment option is an intraarticular platelet rich plasma (PRP) injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of PRP is to stimulate the body's existing regenerative capabilities. Since it is&#xD;
      known that platelets play a key role in the body's natural healing processes, multiple&#xD;
      clinical trials have been conducted to determine if injecting the affected joint with a&#xD;
      platelet rich sample of their own blood promotes healing and thus improves pain and function&#xD;
      for patients suffering from osteoarthritis. The studies involving PRP have yielded some&#xD;
      promising outcomes, however much remains unknown about maximizing outcomes using this&#xD;
      technology and a clear and defined protocol for this intervention does not yet exist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to clarify some of the factors that affect clinical outcomes, such as&#xD;
      platelet and cell concentrations (both in a serum sample and in the centrifuged PRP sample)&#xD;
      and patient demographics. Determining if higher platelet counts in the serum sample are&#xD;
      associated with better outcomes could potentially be used to prognosticate patient outcomes&#xD;
      and candidacy for the procedure. The investigators are examining if PRP injections reduce the&#xD;
      costly utilization of emergency room care and use of opioid pain medications before and after&#xD;
      the procedure. The investigators are correlating how specific PRP cell and substance&#xD;
      concentrations (platelet, monocytes, etc.) affect clinical outcomes as well. Ultimately, our&#xD;
      hope is that this study will contribute to the growing evidence that PRP is a safe and&#xD;
      effective treatment option for debilitating knee osteoarthritis, that it can improve pain and&#xD;
      function and reduce opioid use and emergency room utilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study takes place at the University of Toledo Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation&#xD;
      outpatient clinic. 50 subjects is the minimum required to answer the aims of this study but&#xD;
      100 will be the target number for this study over the course of one year. Members of the&#xD;
      study will be recruiting patients by informing physicians in the area about the study and&#xD;
      requesting referrals to the clinic for anyone that might meet criteria and expresses interest&#xD;
      in the study (focusing on orthopaedics, rheumatology, internal medicine and family medicine).&#xD;
      Study members will also be sending out brochures to inform local health care providers as&#xD;
      well as the surrounding public about the study, and information on how to arrange a clinic&#xD;
      visit to evaluate candidacy. Brochures may be sent in the form of paper copies, FAX or email&#xD;
      with an attached brochure. Additionally, the investigators will be informing patients already&#xD;
      established with providers from our clinics about the study. These patients may be contacted&#xD;
      at any of the physicians' sites of service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients meeting criteria, including documented knee osteoarthritis and associated pain, will&#xD;
      have pre and post intra-articular PRP injection visits where information will be gathered for&#xD;
      future analysis. The patient will initially be asked to come in to the Physical Medicine and&#xD;
      Rehabilitation clinic after expressing interest in being a part of the study. During that&#xD;
      initial visit, the patient will be given the initial screening form with inclusion criteria&#xD;
      and exclusion criteria and it will be determined if they are a candidate for the study. If&#xD;
      they do meet the criteria for inclusion, they will then be informed of the risks and benefits&#xD;
      of the study as well as what would be required of them should they choose to enroll. The&#xD;
      patient will then be given the consent form. If the patient signs the consent form and would&#xD;
      like to join the study, the investigators will schedule a follow-up visit which will include&#xD;
      the injection. At that visit, the patients who are physically able to bear children will be&#xD;
      screened for pregnancy with a urine pregnancy test. Once the pregnancy tests are confirmed&#xD;
      negative, they, along with all other patients, will be given the initial surveys to fill out&#xD;
      including a review of their past medical history, the Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain score&#xD;
      questionnaire, and the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis Index (WOMAC)&#xD;
      questionnaire. Once the patients have filled these all out, they will undergo a blood draw of&#xD;
      approximately 60 mL of their blood. Some of this sample will then be sent up to a lab where a&#xD;
      complete blood count will be run. The remaining portion of the sample will be used for&#xD;
      preparation of the platelet-rich plasma (PRP) using the Tortland Protocol developed by Paul&#xD;
      Tortland, DO. After centrifugation, the PRP will be loaded into a syringe to be injected into&#xD;
      the patient's knee. During preparation of the PRP, small samples will be obtained from the&#xD;
      whole blood, PRP, and concentrated PRP while in the biosafety cabinet and analyzed for&#xD;
      quantification of the cell types present and for characterization of the platelets&#xD;
      (activation status, functionality assays). All immunology lab space stated on this protocol&#xD;
      is BSL2 certified for use of untested human blood products. Once the concentrated PRP is&#xD;
      obtained it will be brought back to the clinic for the injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the patient is waiting for the platelet-rich plasma to be prepared, the Timed-Up-and-Go&#xD;
      (TUG) test will be performed in the clinic to assess the patient's baseline functional&#xD;
      ability prior to receiving the injection. Within 1 hour of the patient providing the sample&#xD;
      of blood, the platelet-rich plasma sample will be brought back down from the lab. At that&#xD;
      time, the patient will be brought to an exam room and the platelet-rich plasma injection will&#xD;
      be performed on the affected knee under ultrasound-guidance. A trained physician will perform&#xD;
      the injection using a 2.5 inch, 22-gauge needle and freeze spray will be used as a topical&#xD;
      anesthetic for the 4-6 mL injection of platelet-rich plasma into the affected knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-procedure, the patient will be contacted to set-up a 4 week, 3 month, 6 month, and 1&#xD;
      year follow-up appointment at which time they will be brought back into the Physical Medicine&#xD;
      and Rehabilitation clinic. At the 4 week appointment, the patient will be filling out a&#xD;
      post-injection survey to explain if they experienced any adverse effects from the injection.&#xD;
      In addition, the patient will have the opportunity at this appointment to ask any questions&#xD;
      or voice any concerns that may have come up after the injection. At the 3 month, 6 month, and&#xD;
      1 year appointments, the patients will fill out post-injection surveys (Post-Injection&#xD;
      Medical Survey) regarding Emergency Department and opioid medication utilization since the&#xD;
      injection as well as updated VAS pain score and WOMAC questionnaires. The patient will also&#xD;
      have the TUG test performed again during these appointments. After the 1 year follow-up, the&#xD;
      patient will no longer be followed for purposes of this study. It is important to note that&#xD;
      only treating physicians and nurses, medical students obtaining consent, and medical&#xD;
      assistants rooming patients will see identifiable information. All other study related data&#xD;
      or information will be de-identified using a number system. All study personnel will be&#xD;
      informed that information, included protected health information, is confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results from the follow-up appointment will be compared to the patient's baseline results&#xD;
      using the key code to match the de-identified information. These will results will all be&#xD;
      compiled into the data collection spreadsheet. Descriptive statistics will be used to&#xD;
      summarize the patients' clinical scores by demographic variables. Repeated measures ANOVA&#xD;
      will be used to test for changes in VAS pain score, Timed Up and Go, Opioid utilization,&#xD;
      Emergency Room Utilization and WOMAC questionnaires over time.&#xD;
