      Evaluate the safety and effectiveness of Echo-Focusing using Exablate Neuro as a tool for&#xD;
      treating patients with treatment-refractory neurologic and psychiatric disorders.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The objective of the proposed study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      Echo-Focusing using Exablate Neuro as a tool for treating patients with treatment-refractory&#xD;
      neurologic and psychiatric disorders. Safety will be determined by an evaluation of the&#xD;
      incidence and severity of procedure-related complications from the treatment day visit&#xD;
      through the 12-month post-treatment time point, although events that are not procedure or&#xD;
      device related will be also captured and recorded. Clinical efficacy will be determined using&#xD;
      standard clinical metrics, appropriate for the patient's condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypotheses tested include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exablate ablation with Echo-Focusing can be safely performed in patients suffering from&#xD;
           treatment-resistant psychiatric illness and essential tremor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Echo-Focusing will allow for more efficient (faster) treatments, which require less&#xD;
           energy (measured in Joules), as compared to published data from Exablate thalamotomy99&#xD;
           and Exablate-capsulotomy100 performed without Echo-Focusing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Lesion appearances following Exablate ablation with Echo-Focusing will be similar in&#xD;
           radiographic appearance to those created without Echo-Focusing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Patients who undergo Exablate ablation with Echo-Focusing will demonstrate similar rates&#xD;
           of clinical improvement from those seen after non-Echo-Focusing ablation.&#xD;

    <description>Clinical efficacy will be assessed by evaluating change in quality of life per the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (QLESQ-SF). This 16-item self-report rating inventory measures the degree of enjoyment and satisfaction experienced by subjects in various areas of daily functioning (scale 1 to 5). A higher total score correlates with greater satisfaction. The survey will be collected before and after treatment at day 1 and months 1, 3, 6, and 12 to determine any effect and its change over time.</description>
