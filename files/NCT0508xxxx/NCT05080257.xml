      This study aims to&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To study the prognostic value of LUS in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the relation between Lung Ultrasonography Score and disease severity in&#xD;
           COVID-19 Patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the relation between Lung Ultrasonography Score and mortality in COVID-19&#xD;
           patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At the end of 2019, the COVID-19 pandemic broke out in Wuhan, China, and within few months&#xD;
      -in March 2020- it was declared a pandemic by the WHO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As of September 15th ,2021, there have been 226,844,344 confirmed cases of COVID-19,&#xD;
      including 4,666,334 deaths, reported to WHO (1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the prevalence of COVID-19 and the financial burden it puts on the healthcare system,&#xD;
      the use of a simple, affordable and reliable imaging modality was necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main idea in this research will be evaluating the value of Lung Ultrasonography Score in&#xD;
      predicting the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 pneumonia and investigate the presence of&#xD;
      a relation between the Lung Ultrasonography Score and patients' prognosis and mortality (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Currently, Lung ultrasound had sensitivity 86%, specificity 71.6%, NPV 81.7%, and PPV&#xD;
           77.7%. The LUS had an area under the curve of 0.84 (95% CI 0.78, 0.90). When including&#xD;
           examinations visualizing twelve lung areas, lung US had sensitivity 90.9% and&#xD;
           specificity 75.6%, with NPV 87.2% and PPV 82.0% and an area under the curve of 0.89 (95%&#xD;
           CI 0.83, 0.96). (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In COVID-19 patients admitted in ED, LUS was a good predictor of death, ICU admission,&#xD;
           and endotracheal intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Our main strategy will be enrolling patients admitted to the chest department's&#xD;
           isolation unit, conduct clinical examination, laboratory investigations and imaging and&#xD;
           conduct chest ultrasonography and calculate the Lung Ultrasonography Score of the&#xD;
           patients and create a correlation between the Lung Ultrasonography score and their&#xD;
           prognosis and mortality.&#xD;
