    <textblock>
      REFINE-lung will test whether reduced pembrolizumab dose frequency after 6 months of standard&#xD;
      treatment is safe and effective. Patients treated with 1st line pembrolizumab who are&#xD;
      progression free and otherwise planning to continue therapy at 6 months will be initially&#xD;
      randomised to control 6 weekly versus interventional 12 weekly therapy. If an interim&#xD;
      analysis shows that the 12 weekly treatment is no less effective, subsequent patients will&#xD;
      also be randomised to 9, 15 and 18 weekly treatment frequency arms. Patients who progress on&#xD;
      a reduced frequency arm will be offered re-escalation to standard 6 weekly therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy with pembrolizumab targeting the T cell inhibitory PD-1 receptor has&#xD;
      significantly improved outcomes in advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Approximately&#xD;
      3600 new patients are treated in the 1st line setting per year in England alone and up to 25%&#xD;
      remain on 6 weekly pembrolizumab for 2 years. However, pharmacological and clinical trial&#xD;
      data suggest current frequent dosing for 2 years result in overtreatment. Indeed,&#xD;
      pembrolizumab remains bound to its target receptor for up to 100 days following a single dose&#xD;
      and studies in multiple tumour types have found no relationship between dose and patient&#xD;
      outcome. Moreover, anti-PD1 treated patients who respond but discontinue therapy either as&#xD;
      planned after 2 years, or earlier because of toxicity, can either remain in remission and/or&#xD;
      be sensitive to re-challenge with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REFINE-lung will test whether reduced pembrolizumab dose frequency (9, 12, 15, 18 weeks)&#xD;
      after 6 months of standard treatment is safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This UK study represents a unique opportunity to determine whether pembrolizumab dose&#xD;
      frequency can be safely reduced in NSCLC, resulting in significant cost benefits to the NHS&#xD;
      and globally, in addition to enhanced patient QoL associated with fewer hospital attendances&#xD;
      and reduced toxicity.&#xD;
