    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hypertension may develop in premature newborn infants due to impaired lung&#xD;
      development. The diagnosis of this disease can actually be made with interventional methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we evaluated the importance of echocardiographic examination and blood&#xD;
      laboratory tests in diagnosing this disease.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia diagnosis was done by the same neonatologist according to the&#xD;
      criteria published by the American National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 2001.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic data of patients like: birth weight, gender, gestational age; neonatal morbidity&#xD;
      like: surfactant administration, PDA and its treatment, duration of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      diuretic usage, intraventricular hemorrhage and its grade, necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)&#xD;
      and its severity, any surgical procedures and late-onset sepsis were recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover; maternal and perinatal risk factors like presence of chorioamnionitis, maternal&#xD;
      hypertension and administration of antenatal steroids were also recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiography:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Echocardiographic measurements were performed with a GE Vivid-7 pro equipped with a 3-7 MHz&#xD;
      for 2-dimensional and color flow Doppler mapping by the same pediatric cardiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigations were done in parasternal long, short axis, four chamber, five chamber views&#xD;
      using M mode and Doppler wave. Two-dimensional measurements were done according to the&#xD;
      guidelines of American Society of Echocardiography. M mode views were obtained in parasternal&#xD;
      long axis by putting cursor between mitral valve and apical to tips of the MV leaflets.&#xD;
      Ejection fraction and end diastolic or end systolic volumes were calculated using the&#xD;
      Teicholtz (Teich) method. Estimated Pulmonary artery systolic pressure can be determined by&#xD;
      using the modified Bernoulli equation: 4V2, where V is the maximum velocity of the tricuspid&#xD;
      valve regurgitation jet, measured by continuous wave Doppler, added to the estimated right&#xD;
      atrial pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The echocardiography parameters showing pulmonary hypertension are tricuspid velocity, mean&#xD;
      pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), pulmonary vascular resistance, pulmonary acceleration time,&#xD;
      pulmonary velocity time integral, fraction of area changes of Right ventricle (RV), RV&#xD;
      myocardial performance index (TEI). Severe pulmonary hypertension affects not only RV but&#xD;
      also LV systolic functions. Therefore we measured Left Ventricle (LV) eccentricity index and&#xD;
      LV TEI parameters in order to see whether they were affected in patients w BPD and PHT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) can be measured using Tricuspid Velocity (m/s) and&#xD;
      Velocity Time IntegralRVOT (cm) PVR (Wood units) = 10 × (TRV/VTIRVOT) + 0.16. Here, a&#xD;
      TRV/VTIRVOT&lt;0.2 corresponds approximately to a PVR of &lt;2 Wood Units [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Left Ventricular Eccentricity index (EI), measured at end-systole and end-diastole, from the&#xD;
      parasternal short axis 2D image at the mid-papillary muscle level. The formula (EI=D2/D1) was&#xD;
      used where D1 is the ventricular diameter perpendicular to the interventricular septum&#xD;
      bisecting D2: the diameter parallel to the interventricular septum [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      RV systolic dysfunction occurs in PHT and shown by RV Fraction of Shortening (FS), tricuspid&#xD;
      annular plane systolic excursion (TAPSE) and Inferior vena cava distensibility index.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inferior vena cava distensibility index is calculated by measuring the Dmax and Dmin of IVC&#xD;
      from the subcostal view, and IVCDI exceeding 18% has been reported to be predictive of fluid&#xD;
      responsiveness in adults, and it is often extrapolated in children as well.&#xD;
      IVCDI=Dmax-Dmin/Dmin [10].&#xD;
&#xD;
      First echocardiograms were performed at 36 to 38 weeks' post-menstrual age (PMA) for&#xD;
      screening later repeated at 1, 3, 6 months after the first echocardiogram. Measurements were&#xD;
      made during 3 consecutive cycles and mean values were used in statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary hypertension diagnosis was done according to presence of at least one of the&#xD;
      following criteria [11]: 1) the velocity of tricuspid valve regurgitation of ≥3 m/s in the&#xD;
      absence of pulmonary stenosis or 2)estimated right ventricular systolic pressure (RVSP)&#xD;
      greater than 40 mm Hg, or RVSP/systemic systolic blood pressure greater than 0.5, any 3)&#xD;
      cardiac shunt with bidirectional or right-to-left flow, 4) flat or left-deviated&#xD;
      interventricular septal configuration and right ventricular hypertrophy with chamber&#xD;
      dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum Biomarkers:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Serum biomarkers like kallistatin, NT-ProBNP, gelsolin, homocysteine, cystatin C levels were&#xD;
      measured only in the beginning of the study and not repeated in the following controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Serum Kallistatin Levels Blood for kallistatin level was taken to the tubes centrifuged&#xD;
           at 4000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. The serum was kept at -80°C as frozen until required.&#xD;
           Kallistatin levels were determined by ELISA (R&amp;D Systems, Inc. Minneapolis, USA) as&#xD;
           previously described [12].&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Plasma NT-ProBNP Levels Five ml blood sample was drawn from both patient and control&#xD;
           groups for N terminal pro Brain natriuretic peptide (NT-ProBNP). Blood samples were&#xD;
           centrifuged at +4°C and 1500 rpm for 5 minutes. Plasma part of the upper phase was taken&#xD;
           in to another tube for NT-ProBNP calculation. Samples were preserved at -80°C till the&#xD;
           study date. Later on, they were studied with ELISA method using Biomedica N-terminal pro&#xD;
           BNP commercial kits (NT- ProBNP enzyme immuno assay kit Biomedica, Bratislava, Slovakia)&#xD;
           and Elecsys® 1010 aoutoanalyzer (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Results were&#xD;
           expresses as fmol/ml (1fmol/ml=16.1pg/ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serum Gelsolin Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Venous blood samples of the healthy individuals and patients were drawn on admission.&#xD;
           The blood samples were immediately placed in sterile etylene diamin tetra asetic acid&#xD;
           test tubes and centrifuged at 2000-3000 rpm for 20 minutes at 4°C to collect plasma.&#xD;
           Plasma was stored at -80°C until assayed. The concentration of gelsolin in plasma was&#xD;
           analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay using commercial kits (Hangzhou&#xD;
           Eastbiopharm Co., Ltd, Hangzhou, Zhejiang, China) in accordance with the manufacturer's&#xD;
           instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Plasma Homocysteine Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Plasma Homocysteine was measured using an auto-biochemical analyzer (AU5800, Beckman&#xD;
           Coulter Company, U.S.A.) by the enzymatic method. This method uses the S-adenosyl&#xD;
           homocysteine (SAH) hydrolase reaction principle, in which SAH is hydrolyzed by&#xD;
           hydrolytic enzymes into adenosine and Homocysteine; adenosine is immediately hydrolyzed&#xD;
           into ammonia and hypoxanthine, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) is converted&#xD;
           to NAD by ammonia and glutamic dehydrogenase. The concentration of Homocysteine in the&#xD;
           sample is proportional to the NADH transformation rate. The detection reagents were&#xD;
           provided by DiaSys Diagnosis System GmbH (Shanghai) Co., Ltd.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Serum Cystatin-C Levels:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cystatin C levels were determined with an immune nephelometry method on an ProSpec analyzer&#xD;
      (BN ProSpec, Siemens, Frimley, United Kingdom) using latex enhanced particles coated with&#xD;
      anti-cystatin C antibodies. The reference values for young healthy persons range from 0.53 to&#xD;
      0.95 mg/l. The coefficient of variation was 1.8% within one run and 2.0% during&#xD;
      reproducibility tests. Freezing and long-term storage up to 25 years has a small impact on&#xD;
      stability of cystatin C [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was approved by the local research Ethics Committee. All the parents were informed&#xD;
      written consent were taken from each of them about participating in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Standard Concurrent User V 25 (IBM&#xD;
      Corp., Armonk, New York, USA). Continuous variables were expressed either as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation or median 25th-75th percentiles. Distribution of numerical data is evaluated by&#xD;
      Shapiro Wilk normality test Q -Q graphics. Categorical variables were expressed as counts,&#xD;
      proportions, and percentages. A Kruskal-Wallis test was used to determine whether or not&#xD;
      there is a statistically significant difference between the medians of three or more&#xD;
      independent groups with non-parametric values. If statistical significance was detected&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.05) Post Hoc Analysis - Tukey test was performed for pairwise comparisons. For the&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis of a dependent group; Friedman test was used.&#xD;
