    <textblock>
      This study consists of 2 parts: Dose Escalation Part 1 and Dose Expansion Part 2. The Dose&#xD;
      Escalation Part 1 will evaluate the safety and tolerability of Avelumab in combination with&#xD;
      Lenvatinib and determine the recommended Avelumab and Lenvatinib dose for expansion. Dose&#xD;
      Expansion Part 2 will assess the efficacy of Avelumab in combination with Lenvatinib by&#xD;
      Progression-free Survival in participants with pre-defined primary central nervous system&#xD;
      (CNS) tumors.&#xD;
