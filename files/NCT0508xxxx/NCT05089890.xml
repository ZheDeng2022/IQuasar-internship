      This is a prospective, open, single-centre, exploratory clinical investigation with a primary&#xD;
      objective of studying the binding of bacteria and fungi from hard-to-heal wounds to the&#xD;
      surface of DACC-coated dressings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects suffering from hard-to-heal wounds who are due to start using a dressing from the&#xD;
      Sorbact range will be recruited at one investigation site in Sweden. The subjects will be&#xD;
      divided into three groups by dressing type and there will be 10 subjects in each group, i.e.,&#xD;
      10 subjects will be treated with Sorbact® Compress, 10 subjects will be treated with Sorbact®&#xD;
      Gel Dressing, and 10 subjects will be treated with Sorbact® Ribbon Gauze. The dressings will&#xD;
      be used in accordance with their respective IFU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation is designed to have a treatment period of 14 days with no&#xD;
      additional follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three visits are planned for each subject, including a screening/baseline visit at the clinic&#xD;
      and two further visits to the study clinic.&#xD;
