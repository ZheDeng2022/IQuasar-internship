  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objective of this study is to adapt and test the feasibility of an 8-week motivational&#xD;
      interviewing mHealth intervention, Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption (TRAC), to&#xD;
      reduce alcohol use among rural adolescent and young adult (AYA) cancer survivors during&#xD;
      post-treatment survivorship.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of this study, the feasibility data gathered will inform a definitive randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial of TRAC-AYA to test the efficacy of the adapted intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this study, the investigators will adapt and pilot an existing mHealth intervention&#xD;
      (TRAC) to reduce alcohol use among rural AYAs as part of a randomized controlled trial. TRAC&#xD;
      includes weekly phone sessions with an interventionist and incorporates smartphones for daily&#xD;
      self-monitoring of alcohol use. Upon enrollment, participants will be randomized into either&#xD;
      the intervention (TRAC) arm or control (education and daily self-monitoring) arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Researchers will conduct the study in Kentucky, which leads the nation in cancer incidence&#xD;
      and mortality, has a higher incidence of AYA cancers compared to other states, is 40% rural,&#xD;
      and encompasses over 100 medically underserved areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data used for this study were collected from a study (PI: Lauckner, K01AA02530)&#xD;
      testing the TRAC intervention with people living with HIV/AIDS, which has shown promising&#xD;
      preliminary results, with high feasibility, acceptability, and encouraging preliminary&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

    <measure>Enrollment</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>The primary feasibility outcome is enrollment, with a goal of 60% of eligible AYAs approached enrolling in the study. A higher percentage of individuals who enroll in the study indicate the intervention is accessible to the target population.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Retention</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>One of the secondary feasibility outcomes is retention, with a goal of 60% of study participants completing follow-up. A higher percentage of individuals completing follow-up indicates a greater degree of acceptability of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Intervention adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>One of the secondary feasibility outcomes is intervention adherence, with a goal of 70% of participants completing the program and attending 60% of intervention sessions; with 70% completing the alcohol monitoring. Higher percentages across each of these indicate a greater degree of acceptability of the intervention.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Daily drinking</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 8-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured using participants' self-reported alcohol use on a 4-item survey. This will assess whether any alcohol was consumed, the number of drinks, time since last drink, and plans to drink later in the day. Higher reports of daily drinking indicate greater consumption of alcohol.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Blood alcohol content</measure>
    <time_frame>Daily for 8-12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the BACTrack Mobile Pro breathalyzer, with results being sent to the study team via mobile app. Higher blood alcohol content indicates greater consumption of alcohol.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-intervention (8-12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the PROMIS SF Alcohol 7a, which is a 7-item questionnaire used to assess alcohol use over the past 30 days.&#xD;
Raw scores can range from 7-35. All PROMIS measures can be converted to T-scores, in which the raw score is rescaled into a standardized score with a mean of 50 of standard deviation of 10. A higher T-score indicates more alcohol use in the past 30 days.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Overall Health</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-intervention (8-12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This will be measured using the PROMIS-29 plus 2 v2.1, a 31 item scale which provides an overall profile of health with sub-scales (i.e., physical function, depression, anxiety, ability to participate in social roles/activities, sleep disturbance, fatigue, pain interference, pain intensity).&#xD;
All PROMIS measures can be converted to T-scores, in which the raw score is rescaled into a standardized score with a mean of 50 of standard deviation of 10. A higher T-score indicates more of the concept being measured, which scores calculated separately for each of the subscales.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Self-efficacy</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-intervention (8-12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Self-efficacy will be measured using the PROMIS Self-efficacy SF 4a, a 4-item assessment of overall confidence in one's ability to solve problems and cope.&#xD;
Scores can range from 4-16. All PROMIS measures can be converted to T-scores, in which the raw score is rescaled into a standardized score with a mean of 50 of standard deviation of 10. A higher T-score indicates higher self-efficacy.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Personal control over alcohol use</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-intervention (8-12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured using the Personal Control Scale, which consists of 15 items and assesses personal control over drinking in the past 90 days (at baseline; past 60 days for post-intervention), and perceived control over one's current drinking. Scores can range from 0-60. Higher scores on this scale indicate participants' perceiving to have a greater degree of personal control over their drinking.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol negative consequences</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-intervention (8-12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured using the PROMIS SF Alcohol Use-Negative Consequences 7a, which is a 7-item scale that assesses perceived negative consequences of using alcohol in the past 30 days (e.g. unreliable, social problems, judgement).&#xD;
Raw scores can range from 7-45. All PROMIS measures can be converted to T-scores, in which the raw score is rescaled into a standardized score with a mean of 50 of standard deviation of 10. A higher T-score indicates a higher degree of perception of negative consequences surrounding alcohol use in the past 30 days.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Alcohol positive consequences</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-intervention (8-12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS adult Alcohol Use - Positive Consequences item bank assesses positive personal outcomes of alcohol use over the past 30 days. These items cover physical (e.g., improved sleep, increased sexual desire), mental (e.g., happiness, creativity, positive self-image), and social (e.g., comfort around others, ease in talking to others) consequences of drinking.&#xD;
Raw scores can range from 7-45. All PROMIS measures can be converted to T-scores, in which the raw score is rescaled into a standardized score with a mean of 50 of standard deviation of 10. A higher T-score indicates a higher degree of perception of positive consequences surrounding alcohol use in the past 30 days.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Tobacco use</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This outcome will be measured using the Cancer Patient Tobacco Use Questionnaire (core items), which is a 4-item survey that assesses participants' lifetime and current tobacco use. This questionnaire is not scored.</description>
  </other_outcome>
  <other_outcome>
    <measure>Emotional support</measure>
    <time_frame>Measured at baseline and post-intervention (8-12 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>Social support will be measured using the PROMIS Emotional Instrumental Support V2. This consists of 12 items, and assesses perceived emotional support and instrumental support (e.g. help with tasks).&#xD;
Raw scores can range from 12-60. All PROMIS measures can be converted to T-scores, in which the raw score is rescaled into a standardized score with a mean of 50 of standard deviation of 10. A higher T-score indicates a higher degree of emotional support.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>TRAC: Tracking and Reducing Alcohol Consumption</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The TRAC intervention focuses on increasing motivation and building skills to reduce alcohol use and involves 8, 30-minute sessions with an interventionist. Session 1 is done via video chat to build rapport. Sessions 2-8 are done via phone.&#xD;
Participants will complete smartphone-based self-monitoring of alcohol use. Each morning, participants complete a mobile survey indicating if they drank the previous day and if so, how many drinks they had. Surveys will be programmed using REDcap and sent via a link in the reminder text message. Additionally, participants will be prompted at a random time between 5-11pm and asked to complete a breathalyzer reading using a mobile app to determine blood alcohol content (BAC). If safety concerns are identified (e.g., BAC ≥0.30; blackouts), the interventionist will refer the AYA to a licensed provider with expertise in substance use treatment.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Control</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>Participants in the control group will receive educational materials regarding alcohol consumption and strategies for reducing their use (materials available from American Cancer Society and NCI Alcohol and Cancer Factsheet). They will also participate in smartphone monitoring of alcohol use on the same schedule as participants in the intervention group. This will allow us to compare daily alcohol use data between the two conditions and evaluate the added component of weekly counseling in TRAC.</description>
