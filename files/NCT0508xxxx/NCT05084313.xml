  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effects of several manual therapy techniques on&#xD;
      autonomic nervous system and to compare it with other groups in the study such as heart rate&#xD;
      variability bio-feedback group and the control group. The measurements will take place right&#xD;
      before and after the intervention to evaluate the effects of one single intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All the patients will be clearly informed and will be included in the present study after&#xD;
      their informed consent. The autonomic nervous system (ANS) will be evaluated using&#xD;
      bio-sensors such as Photoplethysmography (PPG) and Galvanic skin response (GSR). The&#xD;
      measurements will take place once for an individual. There will be three groups consisted of&#xD;
      manual therapy, bio-feedback and control groups. Non-invasive cranial and visceral techniques&#xD;
      will be applied on the manual therapy group. The bio-feedback group will get an intervention&#xD;
      consisting of deep-paced breathing to increase cardiac harmony.The control group will rest&#xD;
      for the same amount of time as other interventions to distinguish whether the changes are&#xD;
      related to intervention. After given consent, the participant will be assigned randomly to&#xD;
      one of three groups. All the participants will be subjected to baseline measurement of the&#xD;
      abovementioned metrics prior to intervention. All the interventions will take place in a&#xD;
      controlled setting. After baseline measurement, the participant will take one of the three&#xD;
      interventions which will take 30 minutes. After the data for each person is captured via&#xD;
      sensors, it will be stored on a personal computer for further analysis and interpretation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to investigator's hypothesis, bio-feedback group will show signs of sympathetic&#xD;
      withdrawal and parasympathetic dominance and that manual therapy group will also show same&#xD;
      autonomic shift too.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>There are three groups in the study, two of which includes interventions and one group constitutes the control group. The participants will be randomized into groups with a sealed envelope. There is only one session of the allocated intervention for the particular participant, since the study aims to measure acute effects of cranial and visceral manual therapy on autonomic nervous system parameters.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>This group of patients will receive manual therapy techniques to harmonize vegetative nervous system. PPG and GSR will be recorded during the intervention. The techniques consist of suboccipital decompression, rib raising, diaphragm, larynx and mediastinum mobilisation, sternocleidomastoid muscle fascial release and occipito-mastoid suture release. All intervention is planned to take approximately 20 minutes.The group will include 40 healthy individuals.</description>

    <description>Patients in this group will do slow paced breathing while getting visual and auditory feedback about their ppg and heart rate variability in a sitting position. The patients will be able to cease the session in case of feeling uncomfortable. The main purpose will be that the individuals should breath 6 breaths per minute to increase respiratory sinus arrhythmia which is also reflected at PPG waveforms and in reduction in GSR. The group will include 40 healthy individuals.</description>
