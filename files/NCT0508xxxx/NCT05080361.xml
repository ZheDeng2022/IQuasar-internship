  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Very little data are published on the safety of a rechallenge with a BRAF inhibitor or&#xD;
      combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitor (BRAFi and MEKi) after an adverse event (AE). This&#xD;
      study aimed at identifying the recurrence rate of the same AE after a BRAFi +/- MEKi&#xD;
      rechallenge in patients with cancer and the factors associated to the recurrence.&#xD;

      This is an observational, cross-sectional, pharmacovigilance cohort study. AEs were extracted&#xD;
      from safety reports from the World Health Organization database VigiBaseÂ®, to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety of a rechallenge with a BRAF inhibitor or combination of BRAF and MEK inhibitor (BRAFi&#xD;
      and MEKi) after an adverse event (AE) in patients with cancer.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is the rate of recurrence of the same AE after a BRAFi+/- MEKi rechallenge among informative rechallenges The recurrence rate will be obtained by dividing the number of cases with an AE recurrence by the number of informative rechallenges and will be expressed as a percentage</description>

    <description>Across baseline characteristics (initial adverse event, cancer indication, age, sex). Measurements are the Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities preferred terms for adverse events and cancer indications, the Anatomical and Therapeutical Class for drugs. Age is categorized (18-45, 45-64, 65-74, &gt; 75y.o.), sex (male, female).&#xD;
The recurrence is defined as a second occurrence of an initial adverse event after the treatment was reintroduced. It is a dichotomous outcome.&#xD;
Data will be analyzed through a regression model, so as to determinate which of these covariates are associated with a higher recurrence rate.</description>
