  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Skeletal Class III is a challenging problem that is confronting orthodontists in their&#xD;
      everyday orthodontic practice. The prevalence of this malocclusion varies globally among and&#xD;
      within populations with the greatest incidence among Asian countries. It was reported that&#xD;
      Class III malocclusion represents 3.98% and 5.93% of malocclusions in mixed and permanent&#xD;
      dentitions respectively. Among Egyptians, the prevalence of Class III malocclusion during&#xD;
      mixed dentition was found to be 5.9 % according to the sample studied by Fsifis et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different skeletal components contribute to the development of the classic Class III with&#xD;
      convex or straight profiles. These components are either maxillary retrognathism, mandibular&#xD;
      prognathism relative to other craniofacial structures, or even a combination of them.&#xD;
      According to the sample studied by Ellis and Macnamara, they found 65% to 67% of skeletal&#xD;
      Class III was due to maxillary skeletal retrusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The growth and severity of the sagittal skeletal discrepancy dictate the possible treatment&#xD;
      modalities. On one hand, Growth modification is indicated in individuals who have not reached&#xD;
      the growth spurt yet. On the other hand, cessation of growth leaves only orthodontic&#xD;
      camouflage and orthognathic surgery as treatment options, the severity of the anteroposterior&#xD;
      discrepancy and dental compensation determine which of them gives the best clinical results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common approach for the treatment of growing Class III patients with maxillary&#xD;
      retrognathism is the facemask (FM) accompanied by rapid maxillary expansion (RME). RME was&#xD;
      claimed to open the midpalatal suture and affect the other nine sutures adjacent to the&#xD;
      maxilla. Accordingly, it is said to facilitate the orthopedic effect of the facemask.&#xD;
      However, a meta-analysis concluded that treatment with facemask with or without RME is&#xD;
      clinically effective with a nonsignificant difference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forces from protraction facemask are applied to dental structures so, it has side effects as&#xD;
      mesial movement and extrusion of maxillary molars, proclination of upper incisors,&#xD;
      retroclination of mandibular incisors, backward rotation of the mandible, and increase in the&#xD;
      lower facial height. These side effects might be desirable or undesirable according to the&#xD;
      clinical situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Maximizing skeletal effects and minimizing dental effects will reduce the tendency for&#xD;
      relapse and might be a desirable clinical outcome. For this purpose, in 1985 Kokich et al&#xD;
      used ankylosed canines as a form of absolute anchorage for maxillary protraction. The advent&#xD;
      of temporary anchorage devices (TADs) led to many reports with skeletally anchored maxillary&#xD;
      protraction, Singer et al, Enacar et al, Hong et al, and Kircelli et al.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was followed by several studies applying facemask to miniplates at the zygomatic&#xD;
      buttress, lateral nasal wall, and miniscrews (MS) in the zygomatic buttress, or in the&#xD;
      palate. Consequently, the present study will be directed to evaluate the effects of&#xD;
      skeletally anchored maxillary protraction.&#xD;
