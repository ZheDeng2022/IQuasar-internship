      The investigators objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of hematoma block&#xD;
      compared to intravenous regional anesthesia (Bier block) during closed reduction of distal&#xD;
      radius fractures. Distal radius fractures represent one of the most commonly treated skeletal&#xD;
      injuries in the US. Achieving a fracture reduction that restores anatomy of the distal radius&#xD;
      is of paramount importance. Reductions that re-establish anatomical parameters can prevent a&#xD;
      patient from requiring operative intervention for the fracture, eliminating the risks as well&#xD;
      as costs that are inherent in undergoing surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous regional anesthesia (IVRA) or 'Bier block' is an effective technique used to&#xD;
      provide anesthesia to the distal extremity. IVRA involves venous infiltration of a local&#xD;
      anesthetic with concomitant use of a tourniquet to restrict infiltration solely to the&#xD;
      intended extremity. Hematoma block involves local infiltration of local anesthetic directly&#xD;
      into the site of a hematoma to provide analgesia. Both IVRA and hematoma blocks can be used&#xD;
      to provide analgesia during a variety of procedures including fracture manipulation and&#xD;
      reduction, but there is a paucity of data regarding the possible superiority of one means of&#xD;
      analgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, only a few comparative studies has been performed regarding the use of these two&#xD;
      analgesia methods. Numerous investigators have conducted studies evaluating these two methods&#xD;
      of analgesia; but these studies were of relatively poor quality, are older (prior to 1995) or&#xD;
      did not individually look at all radiographic parameters that are important to orthopedic&#xD;
      surgical providers when determining if a distal radius fracture needs surgery, particularly&#xD;
      ulnar variance and articular step-off or gapping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators institution is one of the few in the country that utilizes bier blocks,&#xD;
      performed by orthopedic residents, for most closed reductions in the emergency department.&#xD;
      This quality makes the investigators institution uniquely qualified and motivated to perform&#xD;
      the proposed investigation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerns regarding the implementation of the Bier block surround its' safety profile,&#xD;
      including possible increased risk of carpal tunnel, and in more severe cases, seizures or&#xD;
      cardiac arrest. Despite the frequency with which we manage distal radius fractures, our&#xD;
      experience has been that the major complication profile of this technique is minimal. Other&#xD;
      studies have supported the notion that catastrophic complications are rare and the most&#xD;
      common &quot;complication&quot; is tourniquet pain. These studies are limited by their nature in that&#xD;
      anesthesia or emergency medicine providers performed the Bier blocks, while in most instances&#xD;
      having the orthopaedic provider perform the block as well as the reduction is more efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard of care for most institutions is to perform a closed reduction of distal radius&#xD;
      fracture with general conscious sedation or a local hematoma block. The investigators&#xD;
      standard of care is to perform Bier blocks as the investigators believe it results in a more&#xD;
      anatomic reduction, due to better analgesia and patient comfort during the procedure, thus&#xD;
      allowing for more aggressive yet tolerable manipulation. Improved reduction quality may&#xD;
      result in less conversion from closed management in a cast to surgical intervention which has&#xD;
      direct impact on the patients being treated as well as on the health care system at large.&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that there is both better analgesia and fracture reduction&#xD;
      with use of Bier block compared to hematoma block.&#xD;
