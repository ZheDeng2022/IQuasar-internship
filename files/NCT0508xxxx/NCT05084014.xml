    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial, 44 participants selected based on inclusion criteria&#xD;
      from physical therapy department of Surriya Azeem Surgical Hospital, Pattoki. Participants&#xD;
      randomly recruited into two groups, 22 in deep stripping group receiving deep stripping with&#xD;
      conventional physical therapy and 22 in kneading group receiving kneading with conventional&#xD;
      physical therapy. Pain, range of motion and functional mobility are the primary outcomes&#xD;
      measured by numeric pain rating scale, universal goniometer and lower extremity functional&#xD;
      scale. Data collected at the baseline, at the 6th session, and the 12th session.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In this randomized controlled trial, 44 individuals with knee osteoarthritis (II-III grade of&#xD;
      Kellgren-Lawrence scale) pre-diagnosed by an orthopedic, were assessed for eligibility from&#xD;
      the physical therapy department of Surriya Azeem Surgical Hospital, Pattoki. Participants&#xD;
      with any other musculoskeletal disorder, cognitive problem and receiving any treatment within&#xD;
      the past three months were excluded from the study. The participants were randomly recruited&#xD;
      into two groups with 22 participants in each group. Group A received deep stripping along&#xD;
      with conventional physiotherapy and group B received kneading along with conventional&#xD;
      physiotherapy. Both the deep stripping and kneading technique applied on the quadriceps&#xD;
      muscle group, hamstring muscle group and around the knee joint. Data collected by a blinded&#xD;
      assessor at the baseline, at the 6th session, and the 12th session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures were pain (measured by Numeric Pain Rating Scale), range of motion (measured&#xD;
      by Universal Goniometer), and functional mobility (assessed by Lower Extremity Functional&#xD;
      Scale). After collecting the data, normality of the data will be entered and analyzed in&#xD;
      Statistical Package for the Social Sciences and than the statistical test will be applied to&#xD;
      compare the within group analysis and between group analysis.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from the baseline in Numeric pain rating scale at 2nd and 4th week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2nd week, 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>It is the simplest and most commonly used numeric scale in which the individual rates the pain from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst pain) 0 = no pain, 1-3 = mild pain, 4-6 = moderate pain, 7-10 = severe pain</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Universal Goniometer at 2nd and 4th week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2nd week, 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>the range of motion (flexion and extension) measured by using Universal Goniometer. For the range of motion, Universal Goniometer was used. It is an instrument made up of plastic material; it has a moveable arm, stationary arm and a fulcrum. The range of motion of the knee joint in extension and flexion was measured. The normal knee flexion range is 0⁰-130⁰ and the extension range is 130⁰-0⁰.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline in Lower Extremity Functional Scale at 2nd and 4th week</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 2nd week, 4th week</time_frame>
    <description>For functional mobility Lower Extremity Functional Scale is used. This questionnaire contains 20 questions about the ability of a person to carry out his/her daily routine tasks. Every question has 5 options 0 = Extreme difficulty or unable to perform an activity&#xD;
= Quite a bit of difficulty&#xD;
= Moderate difficulty&#xD;
= a little bit of difficulty&#xD;
= no difficulty. The participant's score was interpreted at the end by adding all the scores of 20 questions, categorizing them into very high function, moderate function, mild function and very low function</description>
