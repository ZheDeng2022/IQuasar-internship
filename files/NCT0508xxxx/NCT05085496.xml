      This phase I trial tests the safety and side effects radiotherapy in combination with&#xD;
      atezolizumab in treating patients with cutaneous squamous cell cancer that has spread to&#xD;
      nearby tissue or lymph nodes (locally advanced) and can be removed from surgery (resectable)&#xD;
      or cannot be remove by surgery (unresectable). Stereotactic body radiation therapy uses&#xD;
      special equipment to position a patient and deliver radiation to tumors with high precision.&#xD;
      This method may kill tumor cells with fewer doses over a shorter period and cause less damage&#xD;
      to normal tissue. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as atezolizumab, may help&#xD;
      the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells&#xD;
      to grow and spread. Giving radiotherapy in combination with atezolizumab may help improve&#xD;
      outcomes for remission (cancer that is under control) than taking either treatment&#xD;
      separately.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the safety profile of combination of atezolizumab + radiation therapy (RT) in&#xD;
      borderline resectable or unresectable cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Determine pathologic response after neoadjuvant atezolizumab + RT. II. Determine clinical&#xD;
      response (via imaging and clinical exam) postoperatively (if surgically resectable) or at&#xD;
      post-treatment biopsy (if not surgically resectable), and 3 months following the completion&#xD;
      of surgery or RT (if not surgically resectable).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Define the toxicity profile associated with the treatment protocol. IV. Assess&#xD;
      short-term quality-of-life associated with the treatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare immune checkpoint molecule (e.g. PD1, PD-L1, TIM3, TIGIT, etc.) expression&#xD;
      intensity within tumor cells and immune cells in the tumor microenvironment, as well as&#xD;
      immune cell subset infiltration patterns including T cells before and after atezolizumab +&#xD;
      stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) by multiplex immunohistochemistry (or&#xD;
      immunofluorescence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To evaluate the impact of tumor molecular features on immune response and treatment&#xD;
      outcome using next generation targeted deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA)&#xD;
      sequencing of pre-treatment tumor tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To compare changes in circulating immune cell subsets in peripheral blood by RNA-based&#xD;
      T-cell receptor (TCR)-sequencing and immunophenotyping by flow cytometry (or&#xD;
      immunophenotyping by single-cell RNA sequencing), and correlate changes with response,&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, and toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To evaluate circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) levels before start of treatment and&#xD;
      immediately prior to surgery/repeat biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergo SBRT on days 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 of cycle 1. Beginning 1-2 days after SBRT,&#xD;
      patients also receive atezolizumab intravenously (IV) on day 1. Treatment repeats every 3&#xD;
      weeks for 3 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study, patients are followed up every 12 weeks for 24 months.&#xD;
