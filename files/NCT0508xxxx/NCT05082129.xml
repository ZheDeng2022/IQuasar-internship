  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Constipation in children is a common problem. Managing these children is difficult, partly&#xD;
      because they do not respond to laxatives and partly because their bowel problem cannot be&#xD;
      defined. A &quot;gut transit time&quot; test can add information to help choose the best therapy but&#xD;
      this is often not carried out because of the unsuitable radiation dose involved in the&#xD;
      current methods such as X-ray. A new Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) method to measure gut&#xD;
      transit time using inert mini-capsules, the size of small pine nuts, has recently been&#xD;
      developed and successfully trialled during a feasibility study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This main multicentre study will trial the mini-capsules in 436 paediatric constipation&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A fully powered, multi-centre, open label, pragmatic Randomised Controlled Trial (RCT) to&#xD;
      test the use of the TransiCap MRI visible capsules to inform treatment selection and whether&#xD;
      this leads to a change in rate of &quot;treatment success&quot; at 12 months after diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two study arms will include 436 young patients that present at secondary or tertiary care&#xD;
      with constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will receive the TransiCap MRI Visible Capsules and the MRI scans at&#xD;
      presentation, but only the participants in the intervention arm will have the results of&#xD;
      their scan shared with the standard care team immediately. The intervention arm will&#xD;
      therefore receive treatment which is informed by the TransiCap MRI transit time test. The&#xD;
      participants in the control arm will instead receive standard care not informed by&#xD;
      theTransiCap MRI visible capsules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the scans will be shared with the standard care team after the patient's&#xD;
      follow up of 12 months is complete. All participants will receive the TransiCap MRI visible&#xD;
      capsules and the MRI scans&#xD;

    <description>The intervention will consist of young patients with constipation presenting at secondary and tertiary care with intractable constipation. They will undergo the MRI gastrointestinal transit test (TransiCap). Their results will be shared with the patients after both MRI scans are preformed and results calculated. Their treatment selection will therefore be informed by the TransiCap results.</description>

    <description>The control arm will consist of young patients with constipation presenting at secondary and tertiary care with intractable constipation. They will undergo the MRI gastrointestinal transit test (TransiCap). The patients will undergo 2 MRI scans but their results will be shared with the patients after 12 months has elapsed. They will receive standard care treatment not informed by the TransiCap results.</description>

    <intervention_type>Device</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>TransiCap</intervention_name>
    <description>The TransiCap device consists of small, completely inert mini-capsules that, once ingested, can be imaged inside the gastrointestinal tract using MRI, thereby creating a new MRI alternative to the radiopaque marker X-ray test to measure gut transit. The MRI mini- capsules are visualised in the gut using a single fat, water, in-phase and out-of-phase scan.</description>
