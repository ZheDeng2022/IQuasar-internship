  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of food allergy in the western world is a growing health problem. The majority&#xD;
      of reactions are caused due to oral exposure to the known food allergen. However, there are&#xD;
      reports about allergic symptoms after exposure to the allergenic food by contact and/ or&#xD;
      inhalation. Most of those reports are subjective without an objective report of healthcare&#xD;
      professionals. There are only a few prospective studies that observed objectively the&#xD;
      &quot;reliability&quot; of those subjective reports. The estimated chance for systemic allergic&#xD;
      reaction due to skin prick test with fresh food is 0.008%, and even then it will not cause&#xD;
      anaphylaxis that will need epinephrine use. That evidence is in concordance with our&#xD;
      experience. Even with all the information gathered, a study that examines the chance of&#xD;
      systemic reaction after skin contact with the allergenic food is still missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, lately, researchers start to examine the influence of food allergy on the&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) of allergic children and their parents. As expected, all studies show&#xD;
      negative effects on QOL. The major concern of the parents is from random exposure and severe&#xD;
      allergic reaction due to contact with the allergenic food. As far as the investigators know,&#xD;
      no study examined the influence of supervised contact with allergenic food on the fear of the&#xD;
      child and his parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to evaluate the risk for a systemic allergic reaction after skin exposure to&#xD;
      allergenic food in children with known food allergy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of food allergy in the western world is estimated at 8% and is constantly&#xD;
      raising. The majority of reactions are caused due to oral exposure to the known food&#xD;
      allergen. However, there are reports about allergic symptoms after exposure to the allergenic&#xD;
      food by contact and/ or inhalation. Most of those reports are subjective without an objective&#xD;
      report of a healthcare professional. There is one description of a 16-year-old boy with cow's&#xD;
      milk allergy (CMA), who developed anaphylaxis from skin exposure to small amount of cow's&#xD;
      milk under the supervision of a healthcare professional. There are only a few prospective&#xD;
      studies that observed objectively the &quot;reliability&quot; of those subjective reports. In 2003,&#xD;
      Simonte SJ et al examine 30 children with known peanut allergy of which 19 reported past&#xD;
      reactions after contact/ inhaled exposure to peanuts. They did a supervised exposure to&#xD;
      contact and inhalation of peanut butter. They reported only local skin reactions such as&#xD;
      redness (10%), itching (17%), and wheal and flare (7%) with no systemic reactions. Other&#xD;
      studies examine the allergic reactions to skin contact with peanuts and also did not report&#xD;
      on systemic reactions. In one of the studies they examine the allergic reaction to skin&#xD;
      contact in 330 children allergic to peanuts and only 41% had a local reaction with no&#xD;
      systemic reactions. In the second study, the investigators did the accepted skin prick test&#xD;
      (SPT) with peanut and immediate skin application food test (I-SAFT) with peanut butter in 84&#xD;
      children. The investigators did not observe systemic allergic reactions. Only one study&#xD;
      examined allergic reactions after contact with cow's milk in children with CMA. The aim of&#xD;
      this study was to compare the skin reaction of children with CMA with and without atopic&#xD;
      dermatitis (AD). The investigators did not report systemic reactions also. There are few&#xD;
      cases reports that described systemic allergic reaction during SPT, all cases were with fish&#xD;
      allergy. A large study examined reactions to SPT with fresh food on 1,138 allergic patients.&#xD;
      The investigators have shown that the chance of systemic allergic reaction is 0.008%, and&#xD;
      none of the cases needed epinephrine. They review other 15 studies and did not find evidence&#xD;
      to systemic reaction after SPT except for one study that reported a 0.005% prevalence of&#xD;
      systemic reaction to follow SPT with fresh food in infants younger than 6 months of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      That evidence is in concordance with the investigators experience. Until today, the&#xD;
      investigators did not see the systemic reaction after SPT in children with food allergies.&#xD;
      Even with all the information gathered, a study that examines the chance of systemic reaction&#xD;
      after skin contact with the allergenic food is still missing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, lately, researchers start to examine the influence of food allergy on the&#xD;
      quality of life (QOL) of allergic children and their parents. As expected, all studies show a&#xD;
      negative effect on QOL. The major concern of the parents is from random exposure and severe&#xD;
      allergic reaction due to contact with the allergenic food. As far as the investigator know,&#xD;
      no study examined the influence of supervised contact with allergenic food on the fear of the&#xD;
      child and his parents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims primarily - to evaluate the risk for a systemic allergic reaction after skin&#xD;
      exposure to the allergenic food in children with known food allergies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      secondary - 1. To evaluate the QOL of the parents (and children over 8 years) before and&#xD;
      after the contact with the allergenic food.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: 500 children with known food allergy and 100 children without food allergy as a&#xD;
      control group. Simultaneously to the regular skin prick tests, a patch test sticker with the&#xD;
      allergenic food will be placed on the forearm for 15 minutes. The parents will fill quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaire before the tests, a week later, and 2 months later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      expected results - No allergic reaction will occur after the patch test other than mild local&#xD;
      reaction. the level of anxiety will be reduced after the tests.&#xD;
