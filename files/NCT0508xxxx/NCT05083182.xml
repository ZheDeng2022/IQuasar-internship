  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and efficacy of&#xD;
      ustekinumab in juvenile psoriatic arthritis (jPsA).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Juvenile psoriatic arthritis is a complex, chronic, progressive, debilitating musculoskeletal&#xD;
      disease with significant remaining medical need. There is a need for medications which have a&#xD;
      similar efficacy profile and a well-characterized safety profile relative to currently&#xD;
      available (though mostly off-label) anti-tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) inhibitors&#xD;
      for jPsA patients with active disease. STELARA (ustekinumab) is a fully human immunoglobulin&#xD;
      G1 kappa monoclonal antibody which binds with high affinity to the p40 subunit common to both&#xD;
      interleukin (IL)-12 and IL 23 preventing IL-12/23p40 binding to the IL 12 Rb1 cell surface&#xD;
      receptor shared by both cytokines. Through this mechanism of action, ustekinumab effectively&#xD;
      neutralizes IL-12 T helper 1- and IL-23 T helper 17-mediated cellular responses. This study&#xD;
      consists of Screening period (up to 6 weeks), Treatment period (up to 52 weeks) and a final&#xD;
      safety visit at Week 68. The total duration of the study is up to 68 weeks.&#xD;
