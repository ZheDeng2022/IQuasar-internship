    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of The Basic Body Awareness Therapy (BBAT)&#xD;
      in addition to conventional physiotherapy on pain, body awareness, disability, sleep quality,&#xD;
      quality of life in patients diagnosed with chronic low back pain (CLBP). Therefore, a total&#xD;
      of 28 patients with CLBP will be included in the study, and will be divided into two groups:&#xD;
      BBAT group and control group. The control group will receive conventional physiotherapy&#xD;
      consisting of stretching and strengthening exercises, stabilization exercises and&#xD;
      electrotherapy. The BBAT group will receive postural alignment exercises, breathing exercises&#xD;
      and cognitive exercises in addition to conventional physiotherapy. We hypothesized that BBAT&#xD;
      in addition to conventional physiotherapy will be more effective improving the symptoms in&#xD;
      patients with CLBP.&#xD;

    <measure>Oswestry Disability Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>The Oswestry Disability Index (ODI) is the gold standard, valid and reliable outcome measurement tool for assessing functionality in patients with low back pain. For 10 different functional activities, there are 6 different answers for which the patient does not know the score equivalent. Each activity is scored between 0 (functional level adequate) and 5 (severe limitation). The measurement result is expressed over the total score and the ratio of the score to the total maximum score is determined as a percentage. 0-20% minimal disability, 21-40% moderate disability, 41-60% severe disability, 61-80% bedridden, 81-100% completely bedridden or interpreted as exaggerating their situation. The minimal clinical significance level is accepted as 10%, changes occurring less than this rate are considered as measurement error.</description>

    <measure>Functional Rating Index Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>The Functional Rating Index (FRI) is a valid and reliable method that evaluates the functionality and the decrease in functions caused by low back pain. FRI evaluates the functional level in 10 different domain (sleep, personal care, travel, work, etc.) that may be affected due to low back pain. FRI is a scale in which each item is scored between 0 (no pain, no restriction while doing the activity) and 4 (totally dependent, need someone else's help). Maximum score of FRI is 40 which indicates that the patient can easily perform functional activities.</description>

    <measure>New York Posture Analysis Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>The New York Posture Analysis (NYPA) will be used to assess patients' posture. NYPA consists of 13 items that evaluate the static posture of the body from the lateral and posterior aspects, and each item is given a score of five (5) if the person has a correct posture, three (3) if the posture is moderately impaired, and one (1) point if there is a severe deterioration. . The posture score that the patient will receive is one of 25 different scores ranging from 13 to 65, and a higher score indicates better posture. Standard evaluation criteria developed for this test were determined as &quot;very good&quot; if the total score is ≥45, &quot;good&quot; if 40-44, &quot;moderate&quot; if 30-39, &quot;poor&quot; if 20-29, and &quot;poor&quot; if ≤19.</description>

    <measure>Pain Level assessed by McGill Pain Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>The McGill Pain Scale Short Form, which is a valid and reliable method used to evaluate pain, consists of three parts. In the first part, there are 15 descriptive word groups. Of these, 11 evaluate the sensory dimension of the pain, and 4 evaluate the perceptual dimension. These descriptors are rated on an intensity scale from 0 to 3 (0= none, 1= Mild, 2=Moderate, 3= Excess). In the first part of the scale, a total of 3 pain scores are obtained: sensory pain score, perceptual pain score and total pain score. In the second part of the form, there were five word groups ranging from &quot;mild pain&quot; to &quot;unbearable pain&quot; to determine the severity of the patient's pain. In the third part, the current pain intensity of the patient was evaluated using a visual comparison scale.</description>

    <measure>Sleep Quality assessed by Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>Sleep quality of patients will be evaluated using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), a valid and reliable assessment tool. The PSQI consists of 7 components that assess subjective sleep quality, sleep latency, sleep duration, habitual sleep efficiency, sleep disturbances, use of sleep medication, and loss of daytime functionality. Some of the components consist of a single item, while others consist of groupings of several items. Each item is evaluated between 0 and 3 points. It is accepted that a total scale score of 5 and above indicates poor sleep quality. The sum of these 7 component scores gives the overall index score. The total score is between 0-21. A high total score indicates poor sleep quality.</description>

    <measure>Quality of Life assessed by Short Form-12</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>The Health Scale Short Form-12 (SF-12), which is a valid and reliable tool, will be used to assess patients' quality of life. The SF-12 scale evaluates 8 sub-dimensions as physical function, physical role difficulty, social function, pain, mental health, emotional role difficulty, vitality, general perception of health, and 2 areas, mental health and physical health, which is a combination of these dimensions. Considering the last month, the patient scores some of the items between 1 and 3, some of them between 1 and 5, and the sum of the scores for 8 sub-dimensions and 2 domains separately is expressed as %. A higher percentage indicates a better quality of life.</description>

    <measure>Beck Depression Inventory Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) will be used to evaluate the depression status of the patients. BDI is a valid and reliable scale with 21 items, each of which can be scored between 0 (minimal) and 3 (severe hopelessness). The patient answers this scale himself, thinking about the last week. The sum of the scores of the items represents the scale score, and this score ranges from 0 to 63. 0-9 points are interpreted as minimal depression, 10-16 points as mild depression, 17-29 points as moderate depression and 30-63 points as severe depression.</description>

    <measure>The Body Awareness Scale Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>Body Awareness Questionnaire is a valid and reliable scale that measures body awareness of individuals for different situations (illness, cold, change in energy level, etc.). It consists of a total of 18 items, each of which can be scored between 1 (completely true for me) and 7 (not true for me at all).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>The Awareness: Body Chart Score</measure>
    <time_frame>5 mins</time_frame>
    <description>The Awareness: Body Chart (ABC) is a newly developed, valid and reliable scale used to evaluate individuals' body awareness. ABC divides the human body into 51 separate regions and grades each of them separately. It does this by painting with colors, not by grading with numbers. In this coloring, orange is interpreted as &quot;I can perceive in great detail&quot;, yellow as &quot;I can perceive clearly&quot;, green as &quot;I can perceive&quot;, blue as &quot;I can perceive vaguely&quot; and black as &quot;I cannot perceive&quot;. The evaluator then converts these colors to numerical values from 5 to 1, respectively (for example, orange = 5). If the patient feels pain using a red felt-tip pen, he marks the area and rates the pain intensity between 0 and 100. A high ABC score of the patient means good awareness, while a high pain score means severe pain.</description>
