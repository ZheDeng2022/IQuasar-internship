  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single-center, prospective, open-label, randomized controlled clinical study,&#xD;
      and the purpose of this study was to compare the pathological complete response rate (PCR) of&#xD;
      patients with locally advanced rectal cancer treated with short-course radiotherapy&#xD;
      sequential Tislelizumab combined with CapeOX (group A) versus short-course radiotherapy&#xD;
      sequential CapeOX (group B). A total of 100 patients with locally advanced rectal cancer will&#xD;
      be enrolled in the study. These patients were randomly assigned to the experimental group&#xD;
      (group A) and the control group (group B) in a ratio of 1:1.&#xD;

      Subjects in group A will be treated according to the following treatment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard SCRT: A total radiation dose of 25 Gy was delivered in 5 fractions (from day 1 to 5)&#xD;
      Sequential treatment period: After resting for 5 days following completion of SCRT, patients&#xD;
      were treated with Tislelizumab (days 11, 33, 55, 77) and neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CapeOX&#xD;
      (days 11 to 25, 33 to 47, 55 to 69, and 77 to 91).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery: Total mesorectal excision will be performed between day 98 and 105, i.e., between 1&#xD;
      to 2 weeks after completion of Sequential treatment) Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy:&#xD;
      Chemotherapy will be started 4-6 weeks after surgery, and the adjuvant regimen was CapeOX for&#xD;
      2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in group B will be treated according to the following treatment plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard SCRT: A total radiation dose of 25 Gy was delivered in 5 fractions (from day 1 to 5)&#xD;
      Sequential treatment period: After resting for 5 days following completion of SCRT, patients&#xD;
      were treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy with CapeOX (days 11 to 25, 33 to 47, 55 to 69,&#xD;
      and 77 to 91).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgery: Total mesorectal excision will be performed between day 98 and 105, i.e., between 1&#xD;
      to 2 weeks after completion of Sequential treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy: Chemotherapy will be started 4-6 weeks after surgery,&#xD;
      and the adjuvant regimen was CapeOX for 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary endpoint of the study is Pathological complete response rate(PCR ) assessed by&#xD;
      the blind independent review committee (BIRC), defined as the absence of viable tumour cells&#xD;
      in the resected primary tumour specimen and all sampled regional lymph nodes (ypT0N0)&#xD;
