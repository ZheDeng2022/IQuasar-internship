    <textblock>
      Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) is caused by nerve entrapment in the&#xD;
      abdominal wall. Recently de Weerd and Weum have suggested lumbar cutaneous nerve entrapment&#xD;
      syndrome (LUCNES) as a name for a similar condition in the lower back. DIRT can potentially&#xD;
      be used to identify the locations of perforators, thereby also indirectly identifying the&#xD;
      location of nerve entrapment in ACNES and LUCNES, when a point of maximal pain corresponds to&#xD;
      a hot spot. This study evaluates the location of hot spots on DIRT in relation to tender&#xD;
      points and perforators visualized with CT angiography and color Doppler. In the ACNES&#xD;
      patients, DIRT performed with a low-cost smartphone thermal camera will be compared to DIRT&#xD;
      with a professional thermal camera to evaluate the usefulness of low-cost equipment to&#xD;
      visualize the point of nerve entrapment.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (ACNES) is caused by nerve entrapment in the&#xD;
      abdominal wall. The entrapment is believed to occur at the exit point of the sensate nerve&#xD;
      through the anterior fascia of the rectus abdominis muscle. The diagnosis is mainly based on&#xD;
      patient history and clinical examination. Pain relief after local anaesthesia may support the&#xD;
      diagnosis. Often patients go through many diagnostic procedures to exclude other possible&#xD;
      causes of abdominal pain. In such, ACNES is often an exclusion diagnosis. Recently Weum and&#xD;
      de Weerd published an article describing perforator-guided treatment of ACNES using botulinum&#xD;
      toxin serotype A (BTA). Based on anatomical knowledge and clinical experience, they used&#xD;
      color Doppler ultrasound (CDU) to visualize the vascular structures called perforators that&#xD;
      accompany the nerves at the exit points through the anterior rectus fascia. They noticed that&#xD;
      accurate placement of the needle at this exit point triggered the same pain as caused by&#xD;
      ACNES. Their earlier publications on dynamic infrared thermography (DIRT) in perforator&#xD;
      mapping show that the locations of perforators can be visualised as hot spots on the&#xD;
      abdominal skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on their experimental and clinical experience, they found that lower back pain might be&#xD;
      caused by nerve entrapment, similar as seen in ACNES. In a pilot study using CDU, they found&#xD;
      that the point of maximal pain, as marked by the patient, corresponded with the exit point of&#xD;
      a perforator through the lumbar fascia. Knowledge from the use of a lumbar artery perforator&#xD;
      flap makes it very likely that the sensate nerve accompanies these perforator vessels.&#xD;
      Recently de Weerd and Weum have suggested lumbar cutaneous nerve entrapment syndrome (LUCNES)&#xD;
      as a name for this condition. DIRT can potentially be used to identify the locations of these&#xD;
      perforators, thereby also indirectly identifying the location of nerve entrapment, when a&#xD;
      point of maximal pain corresponds to a hot spot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although DIRT has been used in several patients as an adjunct to support the diagnosis of&#xD;
      ACNES, there are no studies that have systematically evaluated the use of DIRT in the&#xD;
      diagnosis of ACNES or LUCNES. If DIRT could contribute to confirm the diagnosis ACNES or&#xD;
      LUCNES, such would be valuable for clinicians as well as patients. Today, ACNES is often a&#xD;
      diagnosis made by excluding other causes of pain. If DIRT can be used a reliable technique in&#xD;
      the diagnosis of ACNES and LUCNES, such would be of great psychological value to the patients&#xD;
      and may contribute to reduced health care costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General practitioners are often the first health care providers that see patients with&#xD;
      abdominal wall pain and lower back pain. Reliable perforator mapping with DIRT has until&#xD;
      recently only been possible with expensive professional thermography equipment. Low-cost&#xD;
      thermography cameras for smartphones are now available. If these cameras can provide reliable&#xD;
      information on the location of perforators, and thereby also the location of nerve&#xD;
      entrapment, general practitioners and other clinicians could use DIRT as a diagnostic tool&#xD;
      for this patient group without expensive professional thermography equipment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim and hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the usefulness of DIRT in the diagnostics of ACNES and&#xD;
      LUCNES, as well as evaluating if inexpensive smartphone thermal cameras are equally reliable&#xD;
      as professional thermography equipment in the diagnostics of ACNES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: DIRT is a reliable tool to support the diagnosis of ACNES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: DIRT is a reliable tool to support the diagnosis of LUCNES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: Smartphone thermal cameras are equally reliable as professional thermography&#xD;
      equipment in the diagnosis of ACNES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited on a voluntary basis from the list of patients referred to the&#xD;
      outpatient clinic at the department of plastic surgery, University hospital of North Norway&#xD;
      (UNN), with the diagnosis ACNES or LUCNES. Only patients above the age of 18 years, that are&#xD;
      not pregnant, with no history of allergic reactions to iodine contrast media, reduced renal&#xD;
      function or kidney disease will be included. Based on clinical experience and previous&#xD;
      research on perforator mapping, we estimate that 25 patients from each group will provide&#xD;
      reliable data to evaluate the usefulness of DIRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to mark the location of maximal pain on their abdominal wall&#xD;
      (ACNES) or lower back (LUCNES) with a permanent marker before arrival at the outpatient&#xD;
      clinic. DIRT will be performed simultaneously with professional thermography equipment and a&#xD;
      smartphone thermal camera, using the protocol described by Weum and de Weerd. Afterward the&#xD;
      point of maximal pain will be marked with a plastic marker taped to the skin, before CTA is&#xD;
      performed in the arterial phase. ACNES patients are examined in the supine position, and&#xD;
      LUCNES patients in the prone position. The student will perform CDU to evaluate if the point&#xD;
      of maximal pain corresponds with a perforator exiting the muscle fascia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients recruited are referred to ultrasound-guided injection with BTA. If CDU reveals&#xD;
      that the point of maximal pain corresponds to the exit point of a perforator, the student&#xD;
      will perform an ultrasound-guided injection of BTA around the perforator at the exit point.&#xD;
      The student will collect data about pain related to needle placement and injection of BTA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All data will be analyzed with respect to the reliability of DIRT, both with professional&#xD;
      equipment and smartphone thermal camera, to identify the location of nerve entrapment. As&#xD;
      DIRT only provides indirect information on the point of nerve entrapment, the findings from&#xD;
      DIRT will be compared with the findings from both CTA and CDU, which are imaging modalities&#xD;
      that are able to visualize these exit points accurately. As an indicator of the usefulness of&#xD;
      DIRT, the student will also evaluate the effect of BTA on the pain reported by patients three&#xD;
      weeks after the procedure using a VAS score and quality of life assessment compared with data&#xD;
      collected before the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As all patients have been referred for ambulatory treatment at UNN, clinical data will be&#xD;
      stored in the electronic patient journal. Findings from the imaging modalities will be stored&#xD;
      in the RIS and PACS system at the department of radiology. Following approval by the data&#xD;
      protection officer at UNN, depersonalized data will be stored at secure research server and&#xD;
      used for later analysis. Data will be stored for seven years after publication and then&#xD;
      deleted.&#xD;
