  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PQ-421a-002 (Helia) is an open-label, extension study to evaluate the safety, tolerability&#xD;
      and efficacy of QR 421a administered via intravitreal (IVT) injection in one or both eyes, in&#xD;
      subjects â‰¥ 18 years of age with RP due to mutations in exon 13 of the USH2A gene, for an&#xD;
      anticipated period of 24 months, or until provision of continued treatment by other means is&#xD;
      available, provided the subject's benefit-risk determination remains positive.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      PQ-421a-002 is an open-label, extension study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      efficacy of QR-421a in subjects with RP due to mutations in exon 13 of the USH2A gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that have participated in QR-421a clinical studies, including study PQ-421a-001,&#xD;
      will be given the opportunity to enroll into this extension study for continued dosing,&#xD;
      provided the subject's benefit-risk assessment is positive, or for additional follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator, in consultation and agreement with the Medical Monitor, will decide on&#xD;
      subject's enrollment upon assessment of subject's benefit-risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QR 421a will be first administered to the fellow eye (as defined in the preceding study), and&#xD;
      will be repeated every 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of the study eye (as defined in the preceding study) can commence 3 months (9&#xD;
      months for subjects from study PQ-421a-001) after the treatment of the fellow eye has been&#xD;
      initiated and will be repeated every 6 months as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Investigator, in consultation and agreement with the Medical Monitor, will decide on&#xD;
      dosing of both eyes. Continued subject treatment in this study will be pursued provided that&#xD;
      the benefit-risk balance is positive for the individual subject, as discussed and agreed upon&#xD;
      with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same safety monitoring protocol and efficacy assessments will apply to both eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline functional and structural measurements for the study eye will be those from the&#xD;
      preceding QR-421a study. Baseline functional and structural measurements for the fellow eye&#xD;
      will be those from the Screening /Day 1 visit of the current study.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Principal Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 1. Subjects who have participated in a preceding QR-421a study and who may derive&#xD;
        benefit from continued treatment with QR 421a, and/or continued follow up, as assessed by&#xD;
        the Investigator, in consultation and agreement with the Medical Monitor&#xD;
&#xD;
        Principal Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Presence of any significant ocular or non-ocular disease/disorder (or medication&#xD;
             and/or laboratory test abnormalities) which, in the opinion of the Investigator and&#xD;
             with concurrence of the Medical Monitor, may either put the subject at risk because of&#xD;
             participation in the study, may influence the results of the study, or the subject's&#xD;
             ability to participate in the study. This includes but is not limited to a subject who&#xD;
             has uncontrolled cystoid macular edema (CME) in the treatment eye. CME is permissible&#xD;
             if stable for 3 months (with or without treatment). Past CME is permissible if&#xD;
             resolved for more than 1 month.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Safety issue during preceding QR-421a study that may compromise subject safety when&#xD;
             continued dosing, as determined by the Investigator, and in consultation with the&#xD;
             Medical Monitor.&#xD;
