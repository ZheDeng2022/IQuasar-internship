  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this study is to investigate effects of Lu AG06466 on seizure activity&#xD;
      after increasing daily doses during 4 weeks in participants with an implanted responsive&#xD;
      neurostimulation system.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This crossover study consists of 2 treatment periods, each of 29 days duration. On Day -1 of&#xD;
      treatment period 1, eligible participants will be randomized (1:1) to a sequence of&#xD;
      treatments (either Lu AG06466-placebo or placebo-Lu AG06466).&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) up to Day 29 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Episode Starts&quot; consists of brief bursts or epileptiform activity, predefined by the investigator for each individual participant, which the neurostimulator detects and reacts to. The episode starts are mostly composed of brief interictal epileptiform events but also include a smaller number of electrocorticographic (ECoG) seizure onsets.</description>

  <primary_outcome>

    <time_frame>Baseline (Day -1) up to Day 29 of each treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>&quot;Long Episodes&quot; are abnormal events detected by the neurostimulator that do not return to baseline ECoG activity within a predefined period of time, typically 30 to 60 seconds. These often correspond to ECoG seizures.</description>

             seizures (history of persistent seizures refractory to 2 or more anti-epileptic drugs&#xD;
             [AEDs]), with seizures from all foci represented in the implanted RNS electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant is required to have a continuous period of at least 2 months with&#xD;
             constant RNS detection and stimulation settings as well as stable AED (that is, 60&#xD;
             days with no dose adjustments of more than 25%) as determined by medical history and&#xD;
             the Patient Data Management System (PDMS).&#xD;

&#xD;
        Key Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has the RNS System implanted in other regions than the epileptic foci&#xD;
             such as the thalamus.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has a RNS System with anticipated generator change in the coming 6&#xD;
             months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has less than 7 long episodes and/or more than 20% variability in week&#xD;
             to week rate during the prospective baseline period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The participant has or has had any clinically significant immunological,&#xD;
             cardiovascular, respiratory, metabolic, renal, hepatic, gastrointestinal,&#xD;
             endocrinological, haematological, dermatological, venereal, neurological (apart from&#xD;
             epileptic diagnosis), or psychiatric disease or other major disorder, which in opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator may influence efficacy or safety aspects in the study.&#xD;
