  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 1 in 500 pregnant women require non-obstetric surgery. Surgical care for the&#xD;
      pregnant woman raises concern for complications adversely affecting pregnancy outcomes. The&#xD;
      most common reason for surgery is acute appendicitis followed by gallbladder disease. Despite&#xD;
      the common incidence of non-obstetric surgery among pregnant women, little is known regarding&#xD;
      fetal outcome and the impact of laparoscopic interventions versus traditional open&#xD;
      procedures. Even less is known about the role of non-operative management of general surgical&#xD;
      disease in the pregnant population. However, fetal outcome is not compromised by emergency&#xD;
      general surgery condition interventions.&#xD;

      Approximately 1 in 500 pregnant women require non-obstetric surgery. Surgical care for the&#xD;
      pregnant woman raises concern for complications adversely affecting pregnancy outcomes. The&#xD;
      most common reason for surgery is acute appendicitis followed by gallbladder disease. Despite&#xD;
      the common incidence of non-obstetric surgery among pregnant women, little is known regarding&#xD;
      fetal outcome and the impact of laparoscopic interventions versus traditional open&#xD;
      procedures. Even less is known about the role of non-operative management of general surgical&#xD;
      disease in the pregnant population. However, fetal outcome is not compromised by emergency&#xD;
      general surgery condition interventions. The primary objective of this study is to establish&#xD;
      best practices for management of pregnant patients requiring emergency non-obstetric general&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective multi-center observational study of pregnant women and their&#xD;
      fetus/neonate (birth to 30 days) with acute general non-obstetric surgical diseases,&#xD;
      including those undergoing operative and non-operative management. Data collected will be&#xD;
      purely observational and involve no study-based therapeutic interventions or alterations in&#xD;
      patient care. The patients will be managed per institutional standard of care. Data&#xD;
      collection will occur in the following format:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Initiated upon admission for general surgery until discharge for that admission&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Upon the birth of the child&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-delivery of the child, through that admission until discharged, for a maximum of 30&#xD;
           days post- delivery All of the data will be collected from the medical record, as long&#xD;
           as the subject's providers utilize EPIC. Otherwise, an approved member of the research&#xD;
           team may need to contact the patient via telephone to obtain access to their non-EPIC&#xD;
           record.&#xD;
