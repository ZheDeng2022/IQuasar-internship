  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers are looking for a better way to treat heart failure, a condition in which the&#xD;
      heart does not pump blood as well as it should. Heart failure can happen in both adults and&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study treatment, vericiguat, is already available for doctors to give to adults who have&#xD;
      heart failure. It works by increasing the activity of an enzyme called soluble guanylate&#xD;
      cyclase (sGC). The sGC enzyme helps regulate the heart and blood circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current form of vericiguat is a tablet that releases the &quot;active substance&quot; immediately.&#xD;
      The &quot;active substance&quot; is the part of the drug that works in the body to treat the condition.&#xD;
      Vericiguat is currently only available as a treatment for adults. Researchers think&#xD;
      vericiguat could help treat children with heart failure, but think it will be easiest for&#xD;
      them to take a liquid treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study is planned to find out how well vericiguat works in children who have a&#xD;
      specific type of heart failure. Before researchers can give vericiguat to children, they must&#xD;
      first study different doses and ways of taking vericiguat in adults. In this study, the&#xD;
      researchers will study a new liquid form of vericiguat in adults. This form is also known as&#xD;
      the &quot;pediatric formulation&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the researchers want to find out how the new pediatric formulation of&#xD;
      vericiguat moves into, through, and out of the body compared to the currently approved tablet&#xD;
      form for adults. The researchers also want to find out if eating food affects the new&#xD;
      pediatric formulation differently than the current tablet form of vericiguat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include about 36 healthy white male participants aged between 18 and 45 years&#xD;
      old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this study, the participants will all take 4 different treatments in different orders.&#xD;
      They will take:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a high dose of vericiguat in the new pediatric formulation, with food&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a high dose of vericiguat in the new pediatric formulation, without food&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a low dose of vericiguat in the new pediatric formulation, with food&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a dose of the currently available tablet form, with food While taking each study&#xD;
           treatment, the participants will stay at the study site for 4 days. There will be a&#xD;
           break of at least 10 days between each treatment. Overall, the participants will be in&#xD;
           this study for about 11 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, the participants will:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have blood and urine samples taken&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  have their overall health and heart health checked&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  answer questions about how the new pediatric formulation tastes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  answer questions about any adverse events they are having An adverse event is any&#xD;
           medical problem that a participant has during a study. Doctors keep track of all adverse&#xD;
           events that happen in studies, even if they do not think the adverse events might be&#xD;
           related to the study treatments.&#xD;
