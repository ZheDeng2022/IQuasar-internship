      The present application proposes to study the role the composition of the pediatric CF airway&#xD;
      microbiota plays in frequent pulmonary exacerbations in pediatric CF patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to accomplish this goal the dynamics of the composition of the CF airway microbiota&#xD;
      in two distinct subsets of pediatric patients with CF will be characterized, those with&#xD;
      frequent pulmonary exacerbations and clinically stable children. Clinical measures of&#xD;
      pulmonary function, patient reported symptoms, sleep quality, and antibiotic usage will be&#xD;
      recorded, and these findings will be correlated with the lung microbiota data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This strategy promises to identify the key characteristics of the pediatric CF microbiota,&#xD;
      which can in turn be used as noninvasive markers to identify those patients at a higher risk&#xD;
      for experiencing repeated pulmonary exacerbations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute pulmonary exacerbations cause significant morbidity in the lives of children with&#xD;
      cystic fibrosis (CF). As the etiologies of exacerbations continue to be defined,&#xD;
      characterizing the role of the pulmonary microbiota in chronic infection and inflammation&#xD;
      provides an opportunity for insight into the pathophysiology of CF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This point is particularly true for a subset of pediatric CF patients with severe disease and&#xD;
      frequent exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present application proposes to test the overall hypothesis that the composition of the&#xD;
      pediatric CF airway microbiota plays an etiologic role in frequent pulmonary exacerbations in&#xD;
      pediatric CF patients. To address the working hypothesis, next-generation sequencing based&#xD;
      16S rRNA sequencing will be undertaken to dissect the microbiome of pediatric CF patients&#xD;
      subject to frequent pulmonary exacerbations, relative to the microbiome in clinically stable&#xD;
      CF patients. This strategy promises to more specifically and definitively identify the key&#xD;
      characteristics of the pediatric CF microbiota that are associated with the occurrence of&#xD;
      exacerbations. Record clinical measures of pulmonary function, patient reported symptoms,&#xD;
      sleep quality, and antibiotic usage, and correlate these findings with the lung microbiota&#xD;
      data. This insight would in turn provide noninvasive biomarkers to identify those patients at&#xD;
      a higher risk for experiencing repeated pulmonary exacerbations, which over the long-term&#xD;
      significantly compromise lung function.&#xD;

        For the &quot;Pulmonary Exacerbation Cohort,&quot; recruitment will be of cystic fibrosis pediatric&#xD;
        patients with 3 or more hospital admissions with an admitting diagnosis of pulmonary&#xD;
        exacerbation, requiring IV antibiotics, within the 12 month period prior to study&#xD;
        enrollment, irrespective of race or ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This cohort will be matched with a &quot;Clinically Stable Disease Cohort&quot; which is matched by&#xD;
        age, gender and CF genotype, irrespective of race or ethnicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Ages recruited will be children, adolescents and young adults with Cystic Fibrosis from age&#xD;
        0-22 years.&#xD;
