  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Endometriosis is a type of chronic inflammatory gynecological disease, mainly took place in&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity. In order to investigate the possible correlation between microbes and&#xD;
      endometriosis, the investigators planed to perform 16S rDNA amplicon sequencing, metagenomic&#xD;
      sequencing and metabolomic sequencing of paired samples derived from feces, cervical mucus,&#xD;
      blood and peritoneal fluid.&#xD;
