    <textblock>
      The present study aims to compare the differential effects of a mindfulness-based&#xD;
      intervention (MBI) and physical exercise (PE) on different stress and health variables by&#xD;
      self-reports. A randomized controlled trial of three groups is proposed, with pretest,&#xD;
      posttest and four follow-ups at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months that would be developed among the&#xD;
      employees of two large multinationals.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Work and workplace related problems are common sources of stress. Work-related stress is&#xD;
      associated with a decrease in productivity, greater absenteeism, accidents and injuries,&#xD;
      mental illness, greater errors, and poor performance, among others, which involve significant&#xD;
      financial costs. Therefore, it is crucial to find coping strategies that are effective in&#xD;
      reducing such stress. Probably, the most appropriate strategies, for their real possibilities&#xD;
      of implementation, for their easy execution, low cost and for the empirical support they&#xD;
      have, are mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) and physical exercise (PE). Both types of&#xD;
      practices have shown beneficial effects for physical health, mental health and psychological&#xD;
      well-being in general. Different investigations have compared the implementation of MBI and&#xD;
      PE, both combined and separately, with interesting results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the interactive effects of group x time, the intragroup&#xD;
      changes and the differences between groups, in the different moments (pretest, posttest, 1,&#xD;
      2, 3 and 6-months follow-up) on general health, stress, affective job satisfaction, recovery,&#xD;
      work performance, and positive and negative affect in the three groups considered; an MBI, an&#xD;
      aerobic PE program and an inactive control / waiting list (LE) condition will be contrasted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to evaluate the trend and linear patterns in the change trajectory&#xD;
      in the three groups during the eight weeks of intervention on fatigue, psychological&#xD;
      distancing, sleep, work stress, and attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial of three groups is proposed, with pretest, posttest and four&#xD;
      follow-ups at 1, 2, 3 and 6 months that would be developed among the employees of two large&#xD;
      multinationals (N ≥ 150).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary dependent variables considered are: 1) recovery experiences; 2) perceived stress;&#xD;
      3) general health; 4) affective job satisfaction; 5) individual work performance; and 6)&#xD;
      positive and negative affects. The secondary dependent variables considered are daily states&#xD;
      of: 1) fatigue, 2) psychological distancing, 3) quality of sleep; 4) work stress; and 5)&#xD;
      attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sociodemographic data will be collected at baseline (age, gender, level of education, number&#xD;
      of economically dependent persons, type of contract, type of working day (split/continuous),&#xD;
      workstation type, seniority in the organization, seniority in current position and&#xD;
      teleworking modality).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators identified two candidate covariates: 1) pharmacological treatment that can&#xD;
      influence the psychological state (measured with two alternatives, use / non-use of&#xD;
      anxiolytics, hypnotics and other psychotropic drugs); 2) Baseline state of stress and work&#xD;
      stress (measured using a single item scale, Likert scale from 1 to 5, 1 being very low and 5&#xD;
      very high)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention program is structured for 8 weeks, during which the two intervention groups&#xD;
      will carry out their recovery strategy (IBM or EF), starting and increasing the practice 5&#xD;
      minutes every two weeks (weeks 1 and 2, 15 minutes; weeks 3 and 4, 20 minutes; weeks 5 and 6,&#xD;
      25; weeks 7 and 8, 30 minutes). The control group will continue as usual. Record will be&#xD;
      taken of recovery strategies that workers perform naturally and spontaneously, and will be&#xD;
      compared to strategies guided by interventions, as those the investigators propose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that this study is a quasi-pioneering initiative because of its&#xD;
      theme, uses a robust methodology, and will have an important scientific-technical impact. The&#xD;
      importance of the topic addressed in terms of health and business productivity is associated&#xD;
      with important contributions in terms of knowledge transfer to companies and society in&#xD;
      general.&#xD;
