  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the effects of a low energy, high protein tube feeding&#xD;
      formula on body weight in tube fed patients who are obese. It will also assess study formula&#xD;
      tolerance as well as impact of the study formula on lean body mass, blood pressure, blood&#xD;
      sugar and lipids.&#xD;

    <intervention_type>Dietary Supplement</intervention_type>
    <intervention_name>Peptamen Intense VHP, Nestl√© Health Science, Switzerland</intervention_name>
    <description>An enteral formula containing hydrolyzed whey protein, maltodextrin, long-chain triglycerides, medium chain triglycerides (MCT), vitamins and minerals.
