  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A group of 24 healthy volunteers are challenged one or three times with 20 male Schistosoma&#xD;
      mansoni cercariae to investigate whether this leads to protection and to identify potential&#xD;
      correlates of protection&#xD;

          2. Subject has adequate understanding of the procedures of the study and agrees to abide&#xD;
             strictly thereby.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is able to communicate well with the investigator, is available to attend all&#xD;
             study visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject will remain within Europe (excluding Corsica) during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject agrees to refrain from blood and plasma donation to Sanquin or for other&#xD;
             purposes throughout the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. For female subjects: subject agrees to use adequate contraception and not to&#xD;
             breastfeed for the duration of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has signed informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Any history, or evidence at screening, of clinically significant symptoms, physical&#xD;
             signs or abnormal laboratory values suggestive of systemic conditions, such as&#xD;
             cardiovascular, pulmonary, renal, hepatic, neurological, dermatological, endocrine,&#xD;
             malignant, haematological, infectious, immune-deficient, (severe) psychiatric and&#xD;
             other disorders, which could compromise the health of the volunteer during the study&#xD;
             or interfere with the interpretation of the study results. These include, but are not&#xD;
             limited to, any of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  body weight &lt;50 kg or Body Mass Index (BMI) &lt;18.0 or &gt;35.0 kg/m2 at screening;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  positive HIV, hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus screening tests;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  the use of immune modifying drugs within three months prior to study onset&#xD;
                  (inhaled and topical corticosteroids and oral anti-histamines exempted) or&#xD;
                  expected use of such during the study period;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of malignancy of any organ system (other than localized basal cell&#xD;
                  carcinoma of the skin), treated or untreated, within the past 5 years;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  any history of treatment for severe psychiatric disease by a psychiatrist in the&#xD;
                  past year;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  history of drug or alcohol abuse interfering with normal social function in the&#xD;
                  period of one year prior to study onset.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. The chronic use of any drug known to interact with praziquantel, artesunate or&#xD;
             lumefantrine metabolism (e.g. phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, primidone,&#xD;
             dexamethasone, rifampicin, cimetidine, flecainide, metoprolol, imipramine,&#xD;
             amitriptyline, clomipramine, class IA and III anti-arrythmics, antipsychotics,&#xD;
             antidepressants, macrolides, fluoroquinolones, imidazole- and triazole antimycotics,&#xD;
             antihistamines). Because lumefantrine may cause extension of QT-time, chronic use of&#xD;
             drugs with effect on QT interval will result in exclusion from study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. For female subjects: positive urine pregnancy test at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Any history of schistosomiasis or treatment for schistosomiasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Positive serology for schistosomiasis or elevated serum CAA at screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Known hypersensitivity to or contra-indications (including co-medication) for use of&#xD;
             praziquantel, artesunate or lumefantrine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Being an employee or student of the department of Parasitology or Infectious diseases&#xD;
             of the LUMC.&#xD;
