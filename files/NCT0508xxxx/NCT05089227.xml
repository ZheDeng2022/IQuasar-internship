  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) is a rare autoimmune disease (incidence &lt;1/100,000&#xD;
      population) responsible for the destruction of red blood cells by the host immune system,&#xD;
      notably through the action of autoantibodies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apart from complications related to anemia, the occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in&#xD;
      this population is frequent, estimated at 20-27%. The risk of VTE is highest during the&#xD;
      period of hemolysis, especially during the first 3 months after the diagnosis of AIHA. This&#xD;
      risk is 7.5 [4.7; 12.0] times greater than in the general population. No clinical predictive&#xD;
      factor for VTE was identified and the usual factors (cancer, previous VTE, bed rest &gt;3 days,&#xD;
      surgery, age &gt;70 years, heart or respiratory failure, myocardial infarction, stroke, obesity,&#xD;
      hormone replacement therapy) were not considered. Several biological risk factors have been&#xD;
      suggested (depth of anemia, bilirubin level, leukocyte count, antiphospholipid antibodies)&#xD;
      but have not been confirmed in other studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIHA is therefore a risk factor for VTE in its own right, and the National Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Care Protocol (NDCP) recommends the implementation of VTE prevention during acute hemolysis&#xD;
      (Grade C). However, the value of this prophylaxis has never been prospectively evaluated and&#xD;
      its duration is empirical. In practice, low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is generally used&#xD;
      during &quot;flare-ups&quot; of AIHA (diagnosis and relapse) in hospitalized patients, but is rarely&#xD;
      continued beyond the hospital phase when VTE also occurs in ambulatory patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, we hypothesize that prolonged preventive anticoagulation during the 12-week risk period&#xD;
      following diagnosis or relapse of AIHA could decrease the incidence of VTE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In orthopedic surgery, this strategy has been proven to decrease VTE from 50% to 10-15%. In&#xD;
      certain high-risk medical situations, prolonged prophylaxis with apixaban has been shown to&#xD;
      decrease the occurrence of VTE from 10.2% to 4.2% in solid cancers4 and from 4-11% to 2% in&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
