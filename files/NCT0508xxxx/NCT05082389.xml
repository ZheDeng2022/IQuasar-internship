      Specialised outpatient palliative care (German: Spezialisierte ambulante Palliativversorgung,&#xD;
      abbreviation: SAPV) aims to support incurably ill or dying people spending their last&#xD;
      lifetime at home. Furthermore, a major goal is to prevent unnecessary hospital admissions.&#xD;
      However, they occasionally occur for various reasons. This project aims to explore predictors&#xD;
      of readmission in terms of structural factors as well as family caregivers' psychological&#xD;
      distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Identification of structural predictors and caregiver reported predictors for hospital&#xD;
           readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identification of psychological liabilities of nursing relatives.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Developing a concept to support nursing relatives.&#xD;

      1. Background Specialised outpatient palliative care (German: Spezialisierte ambulante&#xD;
           Palliativversorgung, abbreviation: SAPV) aims to support incurably ill or dying people&#xD;
           spending their last lifetime at home if possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At the same time unnecessary hospital readmissions should be prevented. However, they&#xD;
           occasionally occur for various reasons. Due to an analysis of own data including 81&#xD;
           patient of our institution we found the following structural factors influencing&#xD;
           hospital readmissions: On average there are 1.3 hospital admissions per patient while&#xD;
           receiving palliative care. The quality of home-based care is one factor for hospital&#xD;
           readmission. Especially patients´ high symptom burden as well as caregivers´ report of&#xD;
           depression and anxiety lead to unplanned hospital readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Former studies show a major impact of psychosocial pressure of relatives, for example&#xD;
           sadness, sorrows, and exhaustion). High scores of distresses seem to correlate with a&#xD;
           higher number of unfulfilled needs. About one third of the nursing relatives reached&#xD;
           high scores concerning anxiety and depression. Moreover, an elevated level of resilience&#xD;
           relates to a positive opinion of health, better social support, and a decreased rate of&#xD;
           depressions of patients who suffer from metastasised oncological diseases. Life quality&#xD;
           of nursing relatives is not only decreased in a psychological way but in all parts of&#xD;
           life and is influenced by spiritual well-being and by the relation of the patient and&#xD;
           the nursing person. The relevance of stable relationship between familiar and&#xD;
           professional helpers is also described by Roen and his colleagues.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods This study is designed as a single-arm, single institution, non-randomized&#xD;
           observational study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study aim is to investigate structural, and caregiver reported reasons for&#xD;
      hospital readmission. Burden and needs for support of informal caregivers that lead to a&#xD;
      failure of ambulatory care should be identified. Afterwards experts will develop strategies&#xD;
      to improve the identified factors and therefore reduce the number of unnecessary hospital&#xD;
      readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.1 Primary goal Are there any structural or caregiver reported factors influencing hospital&#xD;
      readmission during concomitant care by SAPV?&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2 Secondary goals To explore the burden and supportive-care needs experience informal&#xD;
      caregivers caring for patients with an incurable and progressive disease at home? Which&#xD;
      concepts can be developed to improve pressures and needs for support of nonprofessional&#xD;
      caregivers during the patients´ palliative care?&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3 Patients This study aims to include consecutively 240 patients of our institution's&#xD;
      specialized outpatient palliative care team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.4 Primary and Secondary endpoints Primary outcome is the number of unplanned admissions. An&#xD;
      unplanned admission is defined as any hospital stay not being previously planned as part of&#xD;
      intended treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include structural data taken from the patients´ medical records.&#xD;
      Furthermore, four validated questionnaires will be administered to obtain family caregiver&#xD;
      reported factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  quality of life (WHOQOL BREF (WHO | WHO Quality of Life-BREF (WHOQOL-BREF), n.d.)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  psychological distress (NCCN Distress Thermometer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  depression (Health Questionnaire depression module 9- item scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a non-standardized questionnaire identifying the burden of relatives caused by&#xD;
      the SARS-CoV-2-pandemia is administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following structural data concerning the informal caregiver will be evaluated: age, sex,&#xD;
      relationship to the patient, amount of care, educational background, and actual working&#xD;
      situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following structural data concerning the patient will be registered: age, sex, diagnosis&#xD;
      justifying imbursement of palliative care, duration of palliative care, hospital admissions&#xD;
      during SAPV, support by informal caregivers, level of care, use of home-based services, home&#xD;
      hospice, reason for hospital admissions, concomitant cancer therapy, data concerning the&#xD;
      hospital admission, place of discharge. Information will be collected from the patients´&#xD;
      medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nurses of SAPV will answer surprise questions monthly: There will be one surprise question&#xD;
      concerning patients´ death and another one concerning the probability of hospital&#xD;
      readmission.&#xD;
