  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a newly&#xD;
      developed MesoCellA-Ortho tissue-engineered advanced therapy medicinal product in adult&#xD;
      patients suffering with osteoarthritis and additionally burdened with other civilisation&#xD;
      diseases such as type 2 diabetes and/ or obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The active substance of MesoCellA-Ortho consists of in vitro expanded autologous human&#xD;
      adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem/ stromal cells (AT-MSCs) resuspended in carrier&#xD;
      solution for intraarticular injections for individual patents.&#xD;

      To evaluate safety, tolerability and clinical efficacy of a MesoCellA-Ortho product, the&#xD;
      active substance of MesoCellA-Ortho consisting of 20 mln in vitro expanded autologous human&#xD;
      adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem/ stromal cells (AT-MSCs) will be intraarticularly&#xD;
      administrated in adult patients with osteoarthritis and additionally burdened with other&#xD;
      civilisation diseases such as type 2 diabetes and/ or obesity. Hyaluronic acid (HA) will be&#xD;
      used as a Control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety and clinical outcome of the treatment will be evaluated during 6 months of&#xD;
      followup, considering patient's subjective pain level and evaluation of the improvement of&#xD;
      knee joint function.&#xD;

    <measure>Nature, incidence and severity of adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The measure of safety used in this study are routine clinical procedures. They include a close vigilance for, and stringent reporting of selected local and systemic reactions, adverse events including serious adverse events.&#xD;
After 4th rehabilitation visit to study termination, only AEs of special interest and serious adverse events (SAEs), AEs leading to withdrawal from the study and concomitant medications used to treat adverse events will be collected. The AEs of special interest related directly to the state of the knee after intraarticular administration will be: excessive warming of the knee, pain, suffusion, hematoma, knee locking, decrease ROM.&#xD;
The prevalence, duration and severity of AEs of special interest will be additionally analyzed in the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Numerical Rating Scale (NRS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 and Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The numerical scale is one of the most commonly used pain scales in medicine. The NRS consists of a numeric version of the visual analog scale. It is labeled from 0 to 10, with 0 being &quot;no pain&quot; and 10 being &quot;the worst pain imaginable&quot;. This scale can help guide the diagnostic process, track the progression of the pain, and more.&#xD;
Patients will report intensity of pain only in knee subjected to the treatment in the study.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in joint swelling</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 and Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Evaluation the joint swelling during physical examination by 4-items scale: none, mild, moderate, severe. Joint swelling will be assessed only knee subjected to the treatment in the study.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the 36-Item Short Form Survey (SF-36)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>SF-36 is an oft-used, well-researched, self-reported measure of health. The SF-36 is often used as a measure of a person or population's quality of life. It comprises 36 questions which cover eight domains of health: 1) limitations in physical activities because of health problems; 2) limitations in social activities because of physical or emotional problems; 3) limitations in usual role activities because of physical health problems; 4) bodily pain; 5) general mental health (psychological distress and well-being); 6) limitations in usual role activities because of emotional problems; 7) vitality (energy and fatigue); 8) general health perceptions.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 and Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS). It holds 42 items in 5 separately scored subscales; Pain, other Symptoms, Function in daily living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation (Sport/Rec), and knee-related Quality of Life (QOL)&#xD;
The five patient-relevant subscales of KOOS are scored separately: Pain (nine items); Symptoms (seven items); ADL Function (17 items); Sport and Recreation Function (five items); Quality of Life (four items). A Likert scale is used and all items have five possible answer options scored from 0 (No Problems) to 4 (Extreme Problems). Scores are transformed to a 0-100 scale, with zero representing extreme knee problems and 100 representing no knee problems as common in orthopaedic assessment scales and generic measures.&#xD;
Only knee subjected to treatment will be evaluated by KOOS survey.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in the International Knee Documentation Committee (IKDC 2000)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 3 and Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Change in IKDC Questionnaire score. The questionnaire looks at 3 categories: symptoms, sports activity, and knee function. The symptoms subscale helps to evaluate things such as pain, stiffness, swelling and giving-way of the knee. Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function The transformed score is interpreted as a measure of function such that higher scores represent higher levels of function and lower levels of symptoms. A score of 100 is interpreted to mean no limitation with activities of daily living or sports activities and the absence of symptoms.&#xD;
Only knee subjected to treatment will be evaluated by IKDC 2000 survey.</description>

    <measure>Change in cartilage morphology</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Cartilage morphology on MRI. Change in the modified Outerbridge (Modified Outerbridge classification of cartilage defects) classification. It is based on grading cartilage lesions, in which lesions are graded: 0 - normal cartilage, 1 - signal intensity alterations with an intact surface of the articular cartilage compared with the surrounding normal cartilage, 2 - partial thickness defect of the cartilage, 3 - fissuring of the cartilage to the level of the subchondral bone, 4 - exposed subchondral bone.&#xD;
Only knee subjected to treatment will be evaluated by MRI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in cartilage T2 relaxation time mapping in MRI</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>Measurement of relaxation time (measured in milliseconds, ms) in selected ROIs (Region of Interest) in both medial and lateral femoral and tibial condyle. There will be: 6 ROIs in medial femoral condyle, 6 ROIs in lateral femoral condyle, 4 ROIs in medial tibia, and 4 ROIs in lateral tibia.&#xD;
Only knee subjected to treatment will be evaluated by MRI.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Changes in bone marrow edema-like lesions (BMLs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>
    <description>The occurrence of bone marrow edema-like lesions (BMLs) in MRI will be checked. If bone marrow edema-like lesion is present then measurements of width and length (mm) in: medial femoral condyle, lateral femoral condyle, medial tibia, lateral tibia will be performed.&#xD;
Only knee subjected to treatment will be evaluated by MRI. It is hypothesized that the size of BMLs should decrease in second MRI.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in weight distribution on stable platform</measure>
    <time_frame>Month 6 Follow-up</time_frame>

Minimum, maximum and average weight-bearing value (measured in kilograms, kg) of the left and right lower extremity will be recorded.&#xD;
