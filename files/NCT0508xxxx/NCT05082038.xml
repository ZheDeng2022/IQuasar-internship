    <textblock>
      Nuvo Tapered IF (internal hexagonal connection) and CF (conical connextion) Implants were&#xD;
      designed for the the oral functional rehabilitation using dental implants, allowing for&#xD;
      treatment of patients with different bone qualities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to confirm the long-term safety and clinical performance of implants&#xD;
      and abutments of Nuvo IF and CF in daily dental practice setting, by means of prospective&#xD;
      collection of clinical data in randomized clinical trial using these devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Devices will be used , according to manufacturer indications in the IFU. Patients will be&#xD;
      followed for 36 months after implant loading.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study protocol was reviewed and approved by an Ethics Committee (CE) in Brazil. The&#xD;
      sample will be prospectively selected and will consist of 18 patients, presenting 18 years of&#xD;
      age or more, complete edentulism, who qualify for mandibular rehabilitation by means of&#xD;
      full-arch prostheses supported by two Nuvo Tapered IF implants and two Tapered CF implants&#xD;
      .Informed consent in writing will be obtained from each patient participating in the study&#xD;
      prior to any study related procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before study site activation, the implants of each patient in the study will be randomly&#xD;
      allocated (allocation ratio 1:1), so that each patient receives two implants from each group,&#xD;
      on each side of the mandibular arch (Group IF: Tapered Implants with internal hexagonal&#xD;
      connection; Group CF: Tapered Implants with conical connection). A blocked randomization list&#xD;
      will be generated, where the sequence within block corresponds to the quadrant each group of&#xD;
      implants shall be inserted (1:right quadrant; 2: left quadrant). The Randomization List will&#xD;
      be kept by the Sponsor in the Trial Master File. Although this study is not blinded, access&#xD;
      to the randomization list will not be available to the study centers or to the subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment provided to the subjects will be the responsibility of an appropriately qualified&#xD;
      dental practitioners (principal investigator and coinvestigator) to provide the relevant&#xD;
      patient care under clinical study conditions, In the mandible, four implants will be placed&#xD;
      under local anesthesia and with adequate bone bed preparation, as recommended by the&#xD;
      manufacturer, being two Tapered IF implants on one side and two Tapered CF implants on the&#xD;
      other, according to the established by the randomization results. The implants will be placed&#xD;
      at preferably in an axial position for the medial implants and distally angled for the distal&#xD;
      ones, depending on bone availability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately after implant placement, the final insertion torque shall be recorded. The&#xD;
      selection of the prosthetic component and loading protocol (late or immediate) shall be&#xD;
      conducted according to the need of each subject and to the manufacturer's instructions (IFU).&#xD;
      Thus, implant immediate loading may be performed (at the discretion of the surgeon) when all&#xD;
      implants present primary stability of at least 35 N.cm. Maxillary rehabilitation will be&#xD;
      performed by means of confection of muco-supported dentures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data concerning the studied variables (mandibular rehabilitation) will be collected following&#xD;
      the procedures and assessments plan by fulfilling the Case Report Form (CRF), in the&#xD;
      following stages: First visit (Screening); TP - Implants placement; T0 - Implant loading; T6,&#xD;
      T12, T24 and T36 - 6, 12, 24 and 36 months, respectively, thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panoramic radiographs, lateral cephalometric radiographs and computed tomography (CT) scans&#xD;
      will be obtained from the region of interest prior to surgery, for the surgical planning.&#xD;
      Additionally, standardized digital periapical radiographs will be taken in a usual daily&#xD;
      practice frequency, as determined by the investigator: after implants placement (TP -&#xD;
      immediately or within 1 week after implant placement) and during the post-operative stages&#xD;
      (T0, T6, T12, T24 and T36) to assess the osseointegration process, changes in peri-implant&#xD;
      bone level as well as prosthetic settlement and integrity.&#xD;
