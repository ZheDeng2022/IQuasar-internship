  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, multi-center, open-label, dose-escalation and expansion study to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and tolerability, PK, pharmacodynamic, and early signal of anti-tumor&#xD;
      activity of MDNA11 alone or in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor in patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study drug, MDNA11, is a selective IL-2 preferentially activating effector T cells (na√Øve&#xD;
      CD8+ T-cells) and NK cells responsible for killing cancer cells, with minimal or no&#xD;
      stimulation of the immunosuppressive Tregs. It is designed to potentially enhance host immune&#xD;
      response and fusion to albumin increases the half-life further avoiding frequent dosing&#xD;
      required with rhIL-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at approximately 12 clinical sites following regulatory authority&#xD;
      and institutional review board / independent ethics committee (IRB/ IEC) approval and&#xD;
      completion of informed consent. The study will be conducted in two parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sequential Dose Escalation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Dose Expansion in monotherapy as well as with an immune checkpoint inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 80 patients will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor assessment by CT/MRI will be performed every 12 weeks and will continue until&#xD;
      documented disease progression. Treatment may continue for up to 1 year, or until treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation criteria are met. Patients can withdraw from participation at any time.&#xD;
