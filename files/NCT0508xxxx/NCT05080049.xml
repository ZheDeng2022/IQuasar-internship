  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anemia is very common in intensive care patients, affecting approximately two-thirds of&#xD;
      patients on admission, with a mean admission hemoglobin (Hb) level of 11.0 g/dl. The severity&#xD;
      of anemia is associated with increased morbidity and mortality. Its pathophysiology is&#xD;
      complex, involving blood loss (from repeated blood sampling, invasive procedures, surgical&#xD;
      interventions, etc.) and inflammation. The latter is responsible for a decrease in endogenous&#xD;
      erythropoietin (EPO) production and a decreased bone marrow response, which can be very&#xD;
      prolonged (half of the patients discharged from ICU with anemia are still anemic at 6 months&#xD;
      of discharge, with low levels of EPO, compared to the observed Hb levels). On this basis,&#xD;
      several randomized clinical trials (RCTs) evaluating the effect of EPO on the transfusion&#xD;
      rate in this population were performed in the 1990s-2000s. The authors showed a modest&#xD;
      reduction in blood transfusion, which was not considered clinically relevant in view of the&#xD;
      cost of EPO at that time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since then, meta-analyses evaluating the benefits and risks of EPO in intensive care patients&#xD;
      suggest a positive impact of EPO on mortality. The largest, including 34 studies (and 930,470&#xD;
      patients) reports a reduction in the relative risk of mortality of 0.76, 95% CI [0.61 -&#xD;
      0.92]. Beyond the reduction in red blood cell transfusions, the benefit of EPO could be&#xD;
      directly due to its erythropoietic effect (correction of anemia) and/or its&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory/anti-apoptotic properties. Based on this literature, the French critical&#xD;
      care societies have recently recommended the use of EPO. However, the European Society of&#xD;
      Intensive Care Medicine (ESICM) recently recommended against the use of EPO, based on the&#xD;
      same literature, but suggested that the benefit of EPO should be evaluated. Indeed, the main&#xD;
      obstacle to recommending the use of EPO seems to be economic, whereas the arrival on the&#xD;
      market of biosimilar molecules has significantly reduced these costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of the trials on EPO in critical care patients (and included in the meta-analyses) are&#xD;
      quite old (about 15 years) and none of them had mortality as primary endpoint. In addition,&#xD;
      transfusion practices and the quality of blood products have changed significantly over the&#xD;
      years. In this context of disagreement on the recommendations for the use of EPO in these&#xD;
      patients, but of potential benefit on mortality, there is an urgent need to evaluate whether&#xD;
      EPO decreases mortality in adult anemic patients admitted to intensive care. However,&#xD;
      calculation of the number of patients needed to evaluate the benefit of EPO on mortality in&#xD;
      this population yields a number of patients to be included of the order of 1800-2000&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before considering the implementation of a multicenter study involving such a large number of&#xD;
      patients, a pilot study evaluating the feasibility and inclusion capacity for such a study&#xD;
      seems indispensable according to the latest CONSORT recommendations.&#xD;

    <description>Patients receive a subcutaneous injection of 40,000 IU of erythropoietin alfa, repeated weekly until Day 28 (if the hemoglobin level is &lt;12 g/dl and the patient remains hospitalized).&#xD;
The study treatments are administered by an open-label nurse. In both groups, before each injection, iron deficiency (defined as reticulocyte Hb &lt;29 pg, or hepcidin &lt;41 µg/L, or ferritin &lt;100 µg/L, or ferritin &lt;300 µg/L with transferrin saturation &lt;20%) is treated with intravenous iron infusion (depending on the product available at the center). A restrictive transfusion strategy is recommended as long as the patient remains in the ICU, according to recent recommendations.&#xD;
Six visits are scheduled: V1 for inclusion and the first injection, V2 at Day 7(±2 days) for the second injection, V3 at Day 14(±2 days) for the third injection, V4 at Day 21(±2 days) for the fourth injection, V5 at Day 28(±2 days) for the fifth injection.</description>
