  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to compare overall survival (OS) of sacituzumab&#xD;
      govitecan-hziy (SG) versus docetaxel in participants with advanced or metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC) with progression on or after platinum-based chemotherapy and&#xD;
      anti-programmed death protein 1 (PD-1)/ programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) immunotherapy&#xD;
      received either in combination or sequentially.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either SG or docetaxel.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, Up to 30 Months</time_frame>
    <description>The NSCLC-SAQ is a patient reported outcome measure with seven items assessing five symptom concepts of NSCLC: cough, pain, dyspnea, fatigue, and appetite. Each item is rated using a five-point verbal rating scale from &quot;No &lt;symptom&gt; At All&quot; to &quot;Very severe &lt;symptom&gt;&quot; or from &quot;Never to Always,&quot; corresponding to a score of 0 to 4. The sum of all 5 domain scores will be computed, if any scores are missing, a total score will not be computed. The total score ranges between 0 and 20 with higher scores indicating more severe symptoms.</description>
