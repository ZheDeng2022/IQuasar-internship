      Introduction: The progress of stroke recovery is slow and enduring. If stroke survivors are&#xD;
      not properly managed to facilitate their rehabilitation after discharged from hospital, their&#xD;
      risk for recurrence after an index stroke will be very high. Globally, nurse-led post-acute&#xD;
      stroke clinics have been developed to provide tertiary care services to support stroke&#xD;
      survivors. While synthesized evidence supports the idea that the post-stroke services&#xD;
      delivered by nurses in the clinic can improve the functional ability and reduce the&#xD;
      readmission rate, shortcomings of these services such as compulsory traveling time and cost,&#xD;
      long waiting time at the clinic, and the pandemic situation limit the clinic utilization by&#xD;
      stroke survivors. Telecare consultation is a new modality aiming to provide a new healthcare&#xD;
      access experience to the public, though how it can be applied in nurse-led clinic and what&#xD;
      effects it can bring about on post-stroke survivors has not been reported.&#xD;

      The aim of this pilot study is to determine the feasibility and effectiveness of telecare&#xD;
      consultation in nurse-led post-acute stroke clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method: The present pilot study adopts a one-group pre-test post-test design. The potential&#xD;
      subjects will be recruited from the clinic in Queen Elizabeth Hospital if they are (1) having&#xD;
      a confirmed diagnosis of stroke within 1 month before enrolment, (2) referred to nurse-led&#xD;
      post-acute stroke clinic, (3) aged 18 or above, (4) cognitively competent with a score â‰¥ 22&#xD;
      in the Montreal Cognitive Assessment Hong Kong version, (5) living at home before and after&#xD;
      discharged from the acute stroke unit, and (6) having a smartphone or living with family&#xD;
      member who has a smartphone. The participants will receive two tertiary stroke care&#xD;
      consultations provided by stroke nurses via telecare in 2 months. The outcome measures&#xD;
      include feasibility (reasons for refusal and drop-out, acceptance and satisfaction of both&#xD;
      the advanced practising nurses and their patients towards the program), and effectiveness&#xD;
      (degree of disability after stroke, activity of daily living, instrumental activity of daily&#xD;
      living, health-related quality of life, depression). Data will be collected at pre- (T1) and&#xD;
      post- (T2) intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discussion: The findings of this pilot study can provide a preliminary evidence on the use of&#xD;
      telecare consultation in the nurse-led post-acute stroke clinic including its feasibility and&#xD;
      effectiveness on both providers and patients. When gaps are identified, they could be&#xD;
      adjusted to help develop and design a definitive, large-scale randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

    <description>Two tertiary stroke care consultations will be provided by stroke nurses via telecare in 2 months. Consultation content includes provide education on modifying stroke-specific risk factors, disseminate self-management knowledge, reinforce the importance of medication compliance, revise the blood and investigation results, and co-design and follow-up on mutually agreed rehabilitation goals with the subjects. When necessary, the nurse will also refer the stroke survivors to multidisciplinary team members according to the referral guidelines. The nurse will also encourage the patients' family and/or informal caregivers to participate in the consultations.</description>
