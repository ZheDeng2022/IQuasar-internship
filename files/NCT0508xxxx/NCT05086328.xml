    <textblock>
      In a Flemish sample of parents of children with psychiatric problems, this study evaluates&#xD;
      the effect of a parent group training based on nonviolent resistance on family functioning,&#xD;
      parenting variables and mental states of the parents, pre- and post-training.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nonviolent Resistance (NVR) is an intervention method for families and teams that are&#xD;
      suffering from helplessness and hopelessness. By empowering individuals through specific&#xD;
      focus points and techniques, they can re-establish their role as authority figures for the&#xD;
      child. The child, exhibiting dangerous and/or coercive behavior, can feel reconnected and&#xD;
      guided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous research has shown that parents score higher on General family functioning,&#xD;
      Affective reactions and affective involvement, and Role definitions, but not Behavioral&#xD;
      control, Problem solving and Communication. Positive effects were visible at a follow up&#xD;
      moment, three months later. Parents reported significantly lower on anxiety for the&#xD;
      aggression of their child, the self-efficiency about parental capacities and received social&#xD;
      support. General parenting stress diminished significantly. A control group showed no such&#xD;
      significant changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants with specific problems and waiting to be admitted in the residential ward at the&#xD;
      study location can receive pre-care, in the form of a parental group training based on NVR.&#xD;
      In six two weekly sessions, combined with intermediate telephone support and home&#xD;
      assignments, parents are involved in important parent-child-oriented aspects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will evaluate the effect of the training in a Flemish sample, focusing on family&#xD;
      functioning, parenting variables and reflective functioning of the parents, pre- and&#xD;
      post-training. T1 is at the time between invitation to participate and the first session; T2&#xD;
      is in the first week after the last session (T1 + 12 to 14 weeks); T3 is at three months&#xD;
      after the last session; T4 is at six months after the last session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following primary outcomes are expected after the parent group:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More behavior and mental states pointing towards NVR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More use of adequate emotion regulation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less behavioral problems in the child&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes are expected, according to previous research measuring indirect effects of&#xD;
      NVR treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More adequate attunement to child&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More cohesion and structure in the family&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  More adequate parenting behavior&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Less stress and burdening for parents&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also expect parents with a more secure attachment style to benefit more&#xD;
      (T2) and longer (T3 and T4) from the training.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline mean scores in four domains of Nonviolent Resistance as measured with the Parental Anchoring Scale (Flemish version)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 baseline = 1 to 2 weeks before first session; T2 = T1 + 12 to 14 weeks; T3 = T2 + three months; T4 = T2 + six months</time_frame>
    <description>The Parental Anchoring Questionnaire (Flemish version = OAFS) measures Presence, Self-Control, Social Support, and Structure, on a 7-point scale. High scores mean more Nonviolent Resistance.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline mean scores in child behavior as measured with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 baseline = 1 to 2 weeks before first session; T2 = T1 + 12 to 14 weeks; T3 = T2 + three months; T4 = T2 + six months</time_frame>
    <description>The CBCL is a general questionnaire measuring internalizing and externalizing behavior of the child as perceived by the parents, using a 3-point scale. High scores mean more problems.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline mean scores in emotion regulation as measured with the Emotion Regulation Questionnaire (ERQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 baseline = 1 to 2 weeks before first session; T2 = T1 + 12 to 14 weeks; T3 = T2 + three months; T4 = T2 + six months</time_frame>
    <description>The ERQ measures Reappraisal and Suppression as two distinct mechanisms to deal with emotional problems. Reappraisal is related more with healthy coping. A 7-point scale leads to scores pointing to high Reappraisal and high Suppression.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline mean scores in attunement to the child as measured with the Parental Reflective Functioning Scale (PRFQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 baseline = 1 to 2 weeks before first session; T2 = T1 + 12 to 14 weeks; T3 = T2 + three months; T4 = T2 + six months</time_frame>
    <description>The PRFQ measures reflective functioning or mentalizing, a process essential in developing a secure attachment and positive attunement to the child. There are three subscales with a 7-point scale: Pre-mentalizing (PM), Certainty about Mental States (CMS), and Interest and Curiosity in Mental States (IC).</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline mean scores in family functioning as measured with the Questionnaire for Family Functioning (VGFO)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 baseline = 1 to 2 weeks before first session; T2 = T1 + 12 to 14 weeks; T3 = T2 + three months; T4 = T2 + six months</time_frame>
    <description>The VGFO measures Basic care, Education, Social contacts, Youth experiences (of parents), and the Partner relationship, each on a 5-point scale.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline mean scores in parental burden as measured with the Parental Burden Questionnaire (OBVL)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 baseline = 1 to 2 weeks before first session; T2 = T1 + 12 to 14 weeks; T3 = T2 + three months; T4 = T2 + six months</time_frame>
    <description>The OBVL measures possible sources of burden for parents in five scales: Parent-child relationship, Parenting competency, Depressed mood (of the parent), Role restriction, Health complaints, all on a 4-point scale. Higher scores mean more burden for the parents.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change from baseline mean scores in parental behavior as measured with the Short Scale for Parental Behavior (VSOG)</measure>
    <time_frame>T1 baseline = 1 to 2 weeks before first session; T2 = T1 + 12 to 14 weeks; T3 = T2 + three months; T4 = T2 + six months</time_frame>
    <description>The VSOG measures five different types of parental behavior on a 5-point scale: Positive engagement, Setting/teaching rules, Material rewarding, Punishing, and Physical punishment.</description>
