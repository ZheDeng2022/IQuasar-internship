      This study aimed to investigate relationship between CTS diagnosis with electrodiagnostic&#xD;
      studies and median nerve's cross-sectional area measered by US and MRI in PsA patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) is a type of entrapment neuropathy, caused by compression of the&#xD;
      median nerve in the carpal tunnel at the wrist1. It accounts for about 90% of all entrapment&#xD;
      neuropathies. But there is no gold standard technique for diagnosing CTS. Electrodiagnostic&#xD;
      studies (EDS) are generally used in differential diagnosis because the symptoms may be&#xD;
      difficult to interpret. Unfortunetely EDS has some limitations. The factors can limit EDS are&#xD;
      that it is not comfortable for patients and physicians, may require interventional&#xD;
      procedures, need patient cooperation, provide limited information on the etiology of CTS,&#xD;
      time consuming, and can not be used in some patient groups such as patients with&#xD;
      dermatological contraindications. Recent years, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and&#xD;
      ultrasonography (US) have facilitated the diagnosis of CTS. The median nerve cross-sectional&#xD;
      area (CSA) measured by US or MRI has been found to be associated with CTS. However, there are&#xD;
      studies with conflicting results regarding the median nerve CSA in patients with rheumatic&#xD;
      diseases. Psoriatic arthritis (PsA), a kind of rheumatic disease, occurs in up to 30% of&#xD;
      people with psoriasis and can have serious debilitating effects on the peripheral joints,&#xD;
      spine, tendon insertions, and fingers. To our knowlage, any study didn't assess MRI&#xD;
      measurements of median nerve CSA in PsA patients. In this study we aimed to assess CTS's US&#xD;
      and MRI findings in patients with PsA and compare them healty controls.&#xD;
