  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to evaluate participants' experience and satisfaction&#xD;
      during the awake deep brain stimulation (DBS) procedure. Normally, the neurologist will ask&#xD;
      the participant questions and also ask the participant to perform tasks during surgery.&#xD;
      During this time, the neurologist will be talking to the participant and the participant will&#xD;
      be responding by answering questions or participating with the tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For some study participants, there will be one small change made to the typical way the&#xD;
      neurologist conducts this evaluation. The study staff will then ask the study participants&#xD;
      about their experience with the neurologist's evaluation. The subject will not be told what&#xD;
      part of the evaluation is changed for the study, until after they have responded to the&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All participants scheduled for a DBS phase I surgery will be contacted via telephone in the&#xD;
      days prior to their scheduled surgery to discuss the possibility of study participation. This&#xD;
      will be done to give the participant time to consider study participation in order to avoid&#xD;
      delays the morning of surgery. The morning of surgery the participant will be approached in&#xD;
      pre-operative holding room to discuss participation in the study and if amenable sign consent&#xD;
      for participation. This discussion will inform the participant that minor changes are being&#xD;
      made in an attempt to improve the participant experience, but limited information will be&#xD;
      shared to reduce potential bias that might result from the participant knowing what is being&#xD;
      studied.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The neurologist will wear the mask type assigned by randomization for the duration of involvement in the surgery. At the conclusion of the neurologist's interaction with the participant, the participant will be asked a series of questions to evaluate the communication experience. This step will be performed by another member of the study team (not the participating neurologist) who will read from the questionnaire and record the participant's responses. During questioning, the neurologist will step out of the operating room to reduce potential bias from the participants answering subjective questions in front of the neurologist.</intervention_model_description>
