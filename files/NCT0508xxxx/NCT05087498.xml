  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a trial that evaluates the efficacy of autologous cord blood mononuclear cells&#xD;
      infusion as a prevention therapy for complications of very premature infants. In this&#xD;
      single-center clinical trial, 30 pairs of twins neonates less than 32 weeks are included.&#xD;
      They are randomly divided into ACBMNC infusion group and (placebo) group. The primary outcome&#xD;
      is the rate of complications at 36 weeks of postmenstrual age or discharge home. The&#xD;
      secondary outcomes will include respiratory support duration, frequence of incubate, use of&#xD;
      glucocorticoid, pulmonary surfactant and blood, duration of hospitalization and long term&#xD;
      outcomes after two years follow up post infusion.&#xD;

      Study design and settings:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blinded, single-center trial. A&#xD;
      total of 30 pairs of monozygotic twins fulfilling the eligibility criteria will be enrolled.&#xD;
      Subsequently, one baby of each twin will be randomly divided into the ACBMNC infusion group&#xD;
      or control (placebo) group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial treatment methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Soon after the preterm infant was deliveried, written consent was signed by the parents, and&#xD;
      autologous cord blood infusion was applied to the baby in addition to routine treatment.&#xD;
      Those assigned to the ACBMNC group received an infusion of ACBMNC . Those in control group&#xD;
      received an infusion of a placebo solution. Informed consent before birth is signed. Preterm&#xD;
      infants in the ACBMNC infusion group will have their umbilical cord blood collected after&#xD;
      birth, and then their umbilical cord blood will be separated through Guangdong Province&#xD;
      umbilical cord blood Bank to obtain mesenchymal stem cells. Within 24h after birth, ACBMNC&#xD;
      group received an infusion of mesenchymal stem cells timely, while control (placebo) group&#xD;
      received an infusion of a placebo solution which is normal saline with the same volume. Cell&#xD;
      dose for all patients was targeted at 5×107 cells per kilogram.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>In this prospective, randomized controlled double-blind clinical trial, 30 pairs of monozygotic twins less than 32 weeks are enrolled, in which one of each twin is randomly assigned to receive intravenous autologous cord blood mononuclear cells infusion (5×107cells/kg) or placebo ( normal saline) within 24 hours after birth.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Outcomes Assessor)</masking>
    <masking_description>A hospital ethics committee reviewed the study data during the trials. None of them were involved in the study or aware of the treatment-group assignments of the infants. Only nurses and physicians staff conducted the infusion were aware of the treatment assignment, and these individuals had no contact with the staff who collected and analyzed the patients data. The parents are not aware of the assignment. This study is double-blinded.</masking_description>
