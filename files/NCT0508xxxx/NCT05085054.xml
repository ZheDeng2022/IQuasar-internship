      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of neoadjuvant targeted&#xD;
      therapy followed by surgery in participants with advanced non-small cell lung cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) accounts for a high proportion of lung cancer&#xD;
      cases. Targeted therapy improve the survival in these patients, but acquired drug resistance&#xD;
      will inevitably occur. If tumor downstaging is achieved after targeted therapy, could&#xD;
      surgical resection before drug resistance improve clinical benefits for patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC? Here, the investigators conducted a clinical trial showing that for patients&#xD;
      with advanced driver gene mutant NSCLC who did not progress after targeted therapy, salvage&#xD;
      surgery (SS) could improve progression-free survival (PFS).&#xD;

    <description>Participants treated with targeted therapy without progression and radiological confirmation of tumor downstaging (≤stage IIIA) by PET-CT followed by salvage surgery were enrolled into the group of targeted therapy plus salvage surgery.&#xD;
The molecular targeted agents used in our study included osimertinib (80 mg, once a day) . Salvage surgery was defined as surgical intervention based on standard operation (lobectomy plus lymphadenectomy) of NSCLC for advanced patients who initially had no surgical indications, but achieved significant downstaging (≤stage IIIA) without progression after targeted therapy.&#xD;
Targeted therapy was continued after salvage surgery until progression.</description>
