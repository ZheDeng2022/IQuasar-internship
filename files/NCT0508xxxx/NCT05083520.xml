  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Classical immunomodulatory drugs (IMiDs) like thalidomide and its second- and&#xD;
      third-generation analogues lenalidomide, pomalidomide, avadomide (CC-122), and iberdomide&#xD;
      (CC-220) have constantly emerged to new therapeutic areas. Originally developed as a sedative&#xD;
      and banned in 1961 for its teratogenic effects when used during pregnancy, thalidomide and a&#xD;
      number of newly developed analogues are approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma (MM),4&#xD;
      erythema nodosum5 and myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) Thalidomide was used as a treatment for&#xD;
      morning sickness from 1957 until 1961 but was withdrawn from the market after it was&#xD;
      discovered that it caused birth defects. Because of their pleiotropic and especially&#xD;
      anti-angiogenic properties, IMiDs have further been reported effective in many off-label&#xD;
      indications as for Hodgkin's lymphoma, light chain-associated (AL) amyloidosis, and acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drug thalidomide binds to cereblon and changes which substrates can be degraded by it,&#xD;
      which leads to an antiproliferative effect on myeloma cells and possibly the teratogenic&#xD;
      effect on fetal development. The idea that cereblon modulation is responsible for the&#xD;
      teratogenic activity of thalidomide in the chick and zebrafish was cast into doubt due to a&#xD;
      2013 report that pomalidomide (a more potent thalidomide analog) does not cause teratogenic&#xD;
      effects in these same model systems even though it binds with cereblon more strongly than&#xD;
      thalidomide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cereblon (CRBN) is a substrate receptor of the E3 ubiquitin ligase complex. Several key&#xD;
      findings suggest diverse roles of CRBN, including its regulation of the large-conductance&#xD;
      calcium- and voltage-activated potassium (BKCa) channels, regulation of thalidomide-binding&#xD;
      proteins, and mediation of lenalidomide treatment in multiple myeloma. Recent studies also&#xD;
      indicate that CRBN is involved in energy metabolism and negatively regulates AMP-activated&#xD;
      protein kinase signaling. Recent studies also indicate that CRBN is involved in energy&#xD;
      metabolism and negatively regulates AMP-activated protein kinase signaling. Mice with genetic&#xD;
      depletion of CRBN are resistant to various stress conditions including a high-fat diet,&#xD;
      endoplasmic reticulum stress, ischemia/reperfusion injury, and alcohol-related liver damage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are different drugs that have an immunomodulating effect, such as thalidomide analogs,&#xD;
      and are used in various situations. Some of the diseases in which the immune system plays a&#xD;
      role in its etiology are Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Acute Lung Injury (ALI),&#xD;
      septic shock, and sepsis. In cases of lung injury such as sepsis, septic shock, ARDS, ALI,&#xD;
      the immune system is over-activated and as a result, the immune system cells damage the own&#xD;
      tissue of the lung. To break this mechanism, immunomodulatory drugs are used in intensive&#xD;
      care in the treatment of these diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no publication regarding the role of Cereblon in the mechanism of action of these&#xD;
      immunomodulatory drugs used in intensive care. In these intensive care diagnoses (sepsis,&#xD;
      ARDS, ALI), there is no publication showing the correlation between the severity of the&#xD;
      disease and Cereblon protein. Other laboratory parameters are used to estimate the effects&#xD;
      (mortality and morbidity) of these diseases on the patient. At the end of the investigators&#xD;
      study, the investigators think that the Cereblon gene can be used in this estimation of&#xD;
      mortality or morbidity.&#xD;
