  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients undergoing ACL repair with hamstring autograft frequently develop significant post&#xD;
      operative pain at the hamstring grafting site. This pain is within the distribution of a&#xD;
      commonly used regional nerve block, the Interspace between the popliteal artery and capsule&#xD;
      of the knee (iPACK). The investigators plan to randomize consenting patients to either&#xD;
      receiving a SHAM injection of normal saline or to an interventional group of long acting&#xD;
      local anesthetic (Ropivacaine) injected in the popliteal fossa between the popliteal artery&#xD;
      and capsule of the knee (iPACK). Both groups of patients will receive standard of care with&#xD;
      respect to perioperative pain management, which includes a preoperative adductor canal nerve&#xD;
      block and preoperative acetaminophen administration. Dual primary endpoints of postoperative&#xD;
      pain scores and mean postoperative opioid use will be retrieved and compared between groups.&#xD;
      Additional secondary endpoints will be PACU length of stay, PACU opioid use, POD1 opioids&#xD;
      use, and POD1 pain scores (best, worst, average).&#xD;

    <masking_description>The patient will not know which group they are in as they will be injected with either SHAM or Intervention group, which the pharmacy will create. As a result, the anesthesiologist performing the injection and the intraoperative anesthesiologist will also not know if the patient received a SHAM or intervention injection. This will also apply to the PACU nurse. The person performing the data analysis will know which patients received the intervention, as this is required for data analysis.</masking_description>
