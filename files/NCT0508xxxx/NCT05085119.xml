  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The ORI™ or Oxygen Reserve Index (Masimo, Irvine, CA, USA) is a non-invasive monitoring&#xD;
      system for measuring oxygen reserve. It is a digital sensor (almost identical to the SpO2&#xD;
      sensor) which allows an analysis of the absorption of arterial, venous and capillary&#xD;
      components. The measured index, unitless, ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 for moderate hyperoxia&#xD;
      levels: from 100 to 200 mmHg. It can alert the clinician to a drop in oxygen stores via the&#xD;
      drop in SvO2 before a drop in SpO2 is observed. We propose to carry out a study to elucidate&#xD;
      correlation between ORI™ and PaO2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pulse oximetry or SpO2 is the standard and mandatory monitoring of oxygenation during&#xD;
      mechanical ventilation of intensive care and operating theatre patients. Its use is based on&#xD;
      the difference in infrared and red light absorptions of oxyhaemoglobin and reduced&#xD;
      haemoglobin. The calculation of the absorption percentage takes into account the pulsatility&#xD;
      of the signal, reflecting the arterial component, while eliminating the continuous signal,&#xD;
      reflecting the venous component. It is then considered that SpO2 is a reflection of SaO2, or&#xD;
      arterial oxygen saturation. Oxygen exists in two forms in the arterial circulation: dissolved&#xD;
      (PaO2) or bound to haemoglobin (SaO2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the sigmoidal shape of the oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curve, SpO2 is a late&#xD;
      marker of arterial hypoxaemia. Indeed, SpO2 only starts to decrease after a marked drop in&#xD;
      PaO2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypoxaemia is a frequent situation, both in the operating theatre during the period of&#xD;
      securing the airway, intra-operatively, or post-operatively, after extubation, on episodes of&#xD;
      alveolar hypoventilation, such as atelectasis. In intensive care units, it can occur in&#xD;
      injured lungs with various aetiologies (infectious, inflammatory, cardiac, etc). It is an&#xD;
      independent predictive factor of mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exposure of patients to high hyperoxia (FiO2&gt;0.7), over a long period of time, can lead to&#xD;
      pulmonary endothelial damage (due to the formation of reactive oxygen species, ROS),&#xD;
      denitrogenation atelectasis, and possibly a systemic inflammatory cascade. It is currently&#xD;
      suggested that hyperoxia may also have a haemodynamic impact, with a fall in cardiac output&#xD;
      and peripheral vasoconstriction, particularly in healthy volunteers and patients with cardiac&#xD;
      decompensation. However, hyperoxia is a frequent situation during the perioperative period as&#xD;
      it provides safety and a potential oxygen reserve in case of adverse events: hemodynamic&#xD;
      degradation, cardiac arrest, extubation...&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ORI™ or Oxygen Reserve Index (Masimo, Irvine, CA, USA) is a non-invasive monitoring&#xD;
      system for measuring oxygen reserve. It is a digital sensor (almost identical to the SpO2&#xD;
      sensor) which allows an analysis of the absorption of arterial, venous and capillary&#xD;
      components. The measured index, unitless, ranges from 0.00 to 1.00 for moderate hyperoxia&#xD;
      levels: from 100 to 200 mmHg. It can alert the clinician to a drop in oxygen stores via the&#xD;
      drop in SvO2 before a drop in SpO2 is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is little literature on ORI™. A previous study showed a poor correlation between ORI™&#xD;
      (ranging from 0.24 to 0.55) and PaO2, which ranged from 100 to 150 mmHg, respectively. The&#xD;
      company, Masimo, has recently made a change in its algorithm, allowing it to re-calibrate its&#xD;
      sensor. However, no new correlation research has been conducted. We therefore propose to&#xD;
      carry out a new test phase.&#xD;
