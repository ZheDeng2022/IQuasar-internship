  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, single center, double blind, randomized, crossover feasibility study&#xD;
      of oral ketamine versus placebo for the treatment of anxiety in patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer currently receiving or within 12 weeks of receiving cancer targeted therapy. The&#xD;
      primary objective is to determine the feasibility of enrolling subjects and treatment&#xD;
      adherence. The secondary objectives are to describe the safety and tolerability. Exploratory&#xD;
      objectives are to assess the effect of ketamine/placebo on Depression, Anxiety, Physical&#xD;
      Function, Pain Interference, Pain Intensity, Fatigue, Sleep Disturbance, and Ability to&#xD;
      Participate in Social Roles and Activities as measured by PROMIS Anxiety Short Form 7a and&#xD;
      the PROMIS-29 Profile v2.1 of Patient Reported Outcomes, as well as changes in circulatory&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines, blood glutamine levels, and other biomarkers of anxiety and/or&#xD;
      depression.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Due to the objectives of the study, the identity of test and control treatments will not be known to investigators, research staff, or subjects. The following study procedures will be in place to ensure double-blind administration of study treatments.&#xD;
Access to the randomization code will be strictly controlled&#xD;
Packaging and labeling of test and control treatments will be identical to maintain the blind The research pharmacist will manage the investigational agent. The blind will be maintained through the effort of the research pharmacist and the pharmacy. Unblinding will only occur when it is deemed medically necessary. The date and reason for breaking the blind will be documented.</masking_description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To investigate the tolerability of oral ketamine in patients with pancreatic cancer and anxiety, which will be measured by patient-reported Ketamine Adverse Symptom Checklist and Impact scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>This is a self-report tool that provides patient rating (none, mild, moderate, severe) of 33 potential side effects of ketamine. The Adverse Symptom Checklist (ASC) is scored 0 (none), mild (1), moderate (2), and severe (3 points). This scale also asks patients to quantify side effect interference in daily activities, also scored the same way (Min value 0, Max Value 3). Therefore, the total score for the ASC has Min value 0, Max 102 where total higher scores mean a worse outcome. The ASC responses will be dichotomized (frequency: 0%-25% vs &gt;25%; intensity: none, mild vs moderate, or greater; burden: none to mild impairment vs moderate or greater impairment) and will be descriptively summarized by each treatment arm at each assessment time point.</description>
