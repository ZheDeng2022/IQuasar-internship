      The purpose of this study is to collect blood specimens from individuals post infection or&#xD;
      post vaccination over time to assess COVID19 Immunity.&#xD;

      The DxTerity COVID-19 Immunity Assessment Collection Mailer Kit contains the DxCollect&#xD;
      MicroCollection Device (MCD) Serology fingerstick blood collection device packaged as a home&#xD;
      collection kit, designed for collection and shipment of fingerstick blood back to DxTerity&#xD;
      CLIA (Clinical Laboratory Improvements Amendment) certified laboratory for testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical performance of the collection device for use with anti-SARS-CoV-2 antibody tests&#xD;
      will be evaluated for use with cPASS™ anti-SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody detection kit&#xD;
      (EUA 201427).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples may also be used for assessing immunity or protection post COVID-19 vaccination.&#xD;
