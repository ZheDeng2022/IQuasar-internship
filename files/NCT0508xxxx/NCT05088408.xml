  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The high energy nutritional supplement Resource® Energy is approved for human nutritional&#xD;
      support in various clinical conditions, yet it has been used off-label to alleviate the&#xD;
      effects of hunger during bowel preparation for colonoscopy. Its impact in mucosa&#xD;
      visualization quality and hunger alleviation is unknown. The product is liquid and nutritious&#xD;
      but it is not transparent, thus it is conceivable that it could alleviate the discomfort of&#xD;
      hunger during the preparation but possibly compromising mucosa visualization. In this study,&#xD;
      participants who will undergo a colonoscopy (requested for an explicit medical indication)&#xD;
      will take two bottles of the nutritional supplement during the usual bowel preparation. The&#xD;
      quality of mucosal visualization and the participants opinion regarding satiety and product&#xD;
      tolerance during bowel preparation will then be analysed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The high energy nutritional supplement Resource® Energy is approved for human nutritional&#xD;
      support in various clinical conditions. However, it has been recommended by pharmacists to&#xD;
      reduce hunger during bowel preparation for colonoscopy, without any medical prescription or&#xD;
      recommendation as there is no scientific evidence regarding this use. Its impact in the&#xD;
      quality of mucosal visualization during colonoscopy and in relieving hunger is unknown, thus&#xD;
      requiring research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dietary supplement is liquid and nutritious, each serving consisting of 200 mL containing&#xD;
      carbohydrates 42 g, lipids 10 g, proteins 11.2 g and fiber &lt; 1 g, totalling 303 kcal. It is&#xD;
      thus conceivable that it can mitigate the discomfortable feeling of hunger during bowel&#xD;
      preparation, but because it is not transparent it could possibly hamper mucosa visualization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and fifty control patients (with clinical indication for undergoing colonoscopy)&#xD;
      will undergo bowel preparation as usual with the standard of care polyethylene glycol 3350 in&#xD;
      4 litres of water (Klean-Prep®): one day before the colonoscopy with no ingestion of solid&#xD;
      foods, possibly with ingestion of clear liquids with or without sugar (such as tea or other&#xD;
      transparent beverages without pulp, but not milk, yogurt, broth or gelatine), and with&#xD;
      ingestion of 275,84 g (4 sachets) of polyethylene glycol 3350 in 4 litres of water in 3 to 4&#xD;
      hours (250 mL every 15 minutes), starting at 18:00; in the day of the exam the patients can&#xD;
      drink the same clear liquids with or without sugar until 4 hours before the colonoscopy,&#xD;
      which will be carried out in the morning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and fifty patients (with clinical indication for undergoing colonoscopy) will&#xD;
      undergo bowel preparation as usual and take two servings of Resource® Energy Apricot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will be asked about feelings of hunger or side effects of bowel preparation and&#xD;
      colonoscopy (nausea, vomits, abdominal pain, abdominal discomfort, abdominal pressure,&#xD;
      abdominal bloating, syncope, blood in stool, sleep disturbance, work absenteeism) in a scale&#xD;
      from 0 to 10, before and after the colonoscopy. This scale is often used to assess appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopic mucosa visualization quality will be assessed in all patients using the Boston&#xD;
      Bowel Preparation Scale, which is the most thoroughly validated and recommended scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical comparison will the be performed between both groups, regarding colonoscopic&#xD;
      mucosa visualization and side effects and sensations experienced, such as hunger.&#xD;
