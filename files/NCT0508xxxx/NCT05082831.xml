  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      HST003 is a human extracellular matrix designed for injection into the subchondral bone&#xD;
      following microfracture surgery by an injection into the interstices created by the surgical&#xD;
      awl and filling the full defect to help restore-regenerate hyaline cartilage to a pre-injury&#xD;
      state. In this Phase 1/2 clinical trial, we will be addressing the knee joint in conjunction&#xD;
      with microfracture surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HST003 is human extracellular matrix secreted by human dermal fibroblasts under hypoxic&#xD;
      conditions. The various matrix proteins produce a combination structural scaffold in addition&#xD;
      to the natural secreted glycoproteins such as lubricin, fibronectin, laminins, hyaluronic&#xD;
      acid, and collagens - all critical components of cartilage, particularly hyaline cartilage.&#xD;
      This Phase 1/2 study will help design additional studies to support FDA approval for the use&#xD;
      of HST003 in focal cartilage defects in the knee resulting from recent traumatic injury.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HST003 belongs to a new class of natural human matrix components geared toward cartilage&#xD;
      regeneration. The bulk of this purified hECM is structural collagens, actin, and tubulin, but&#xD;
      it also contains structural glycoproteins. HST003 is a physiological scaffold to support the&#xD;
      infiltration of autologous mesenchymal stem cells to regenerate cartilage, and preferably&#xD;
      hyaline cartilage. The safety of HST003 is supported by preclinical data, which show that&#xD;
      hECM is nontoxic, noncytotoxic, nongenotoxic, non-irritant, non-sensitizing, and&#xD;
      non-pyrogenic. The preclinical data summary is contained in the Investigator Brochure (IB)&#xD;
      including biocompatibility data. A description of the manufacture, chemistry, efficacy, and&#xD;
      preclinical safety of HST003 is also provided in the IB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The comparator in this study will be microfracture surgery alone, the current standard of&#xD;
      care. Microfracture treatment is a single-stage arthroscopic procedure that is minimally&#xD;
      invasive and has limited surgical morbidity (see surgical ICF for standard microfracture).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is an Intervention Model where all patients who are identified/confirmed candidates for microfracture surgery will be enrolled to receive the microfracture surgery (standard of care). Ten (10) patients will be randomized to receive the study intervention (HST003). HST003 will be injected into the microfracture defects (interstices) and fill the remainder of the defect to the cartilage margin following surgery. The primary purpose of the study is to compare the two groups: microfracture surgery + HST003 as compared to the microfracture surgery only group.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>Patients will be randomized on the treatment day (Visit 2 per Schedule of Activities below) to undergo microfracture surgery with or without HST003 injection into the interstices and defect post-microfracture procedure. Each clinical site will have a study drug dispenser who will be responsible for randomizing the patient via the IWRS and will know whether the patient will be receiving HST003 or not, maintaining the blinding until the surgeon is approaching the end of the procedure.</masking_description>

    <measure>Assessment of joint pain equal to or lesser than microfracture alone, and equal or greater function, as measured using the KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 168 (week 24, Visit 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The KOOS (Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score) questionnaire will be completed at Screening (only questions 5-9 of the pain sub-form) and at Day 0 (before surgery), 42, 84, 168 and 365. Change from baseline in the KOOS pain sub-score will be compared between the study and control groups to test the hypothesis that use of HST003 in arthroscopic microfracture surgery is associated with an equal or lesser pain score than control. The questionnaire has five separately scored subscales: Pain, Function in Daily Living (ADL), Function in Sport and Recreation, Other Symptoms, and Knee-Related Quality of Life (QOL). Each question is assigned a score (0-4) and a normalized score is calculated for each subscale (100 indicates no symptoms and 0 indicates extreme symptoms). Higher scores represent higher/better levels of function.</description>

    <measure>Assessment of joint pain equal to or lesser than microfracture alone, and equal or greater function, as measured using the validated IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 168 (week 24, Visit 8)</time_frame>
    <description>The IKDC (International Knee Documentation Committee) questionnaire will be completed at Day 0 (before surgery), 42, 84, 168, 365 and 730. Change from baseline in the IKDC score will be compared between the study and control groups to test the hypothesis that use of HST003 in arthroscopic microfracture surgery is associated with an equal or greater knee function score than control. Scores are obtained by summing the individual items, then transforming the crude total to a scaled number that ranges from 0 to 100. This final number is interpreted as a measure of function with higher scores representing higher levels of function. A score of 100 is interpreted to mean no limitation with activities of daily living or sports activities and the absence of symptoms.</description>

    <description>Assessment of joint pain equal to or lesser than microfracture alone, and equal or greater function, as measured using the Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Arthritis Index (WOMAC) questionnaire between baseline and Month 6. The WOMAC measures five items for pain (score range 0-20), two for stiffness (score range 0-8), and 17 for functional limitation (score range 0-68). Lower scores represent more pain, stiffness, and function values.</description>

    <description>Presence of new hyaline or fibrous cartilage formation within the repaired defects as visualized by MRI at Day 168 (week 24, Visit 8) and Day 365 (week 52, Visit 9), comparing microfracture with HST003 to microfracture alone. The change in the volume of cartilage defect filling (as per MOCART) equal or more than 10 pts is a positive outcome. The cartilage filling is measured in point scale of 0-20.</description>

    <description>Investigator assessment of functional Range of Motion (ROM) including overall strength in the knee from baseline at Day 84, Day 168, and Day 365. Normal range of motion for Flexion is 0 to 130 degrees and for Extension is 0 to 5 degrees. Greater than 10 degrees difference would be considered good/positive outcome. Pain-free ROM, beyond what was previously captured prior to treatment and is also compared to the uninjured/untreated knee).</description>

    <measure>An independent central radiology reviewer from the Image Analysis Group (IAG) will read the MRIs, blinded. The reviewer's scores will be used in the efficacy assessment.</measure>

    <description>Minimum Joint Space Width (mJSW) will be performed using IAG's Dynamika's computer aided functionality. The software will recognize the contour of the bone on X-ray and place landmarks to measure the Joint Space Width of medial and lateral joint spaces (in mm). The change in mJSW will be assessed automatically and confirmed by an experienced radiologist. Observed changes in mJSW, which are beyond the measurement error (&gt;0.13 mm; Depuis et al. OAC 2003) will be considered positive / desirable.</description>

    <description>A radiologist will assess the cartilage quality using dGEMRIC (Delayed gadolinium enhanced MRI of cartilage). MR image will be used to draw four Regions of Interest's (ROI's) of cartilage only. The map showing changes in Gd-enhanced T1-weighted (T1Gd) will be created. The average T1 of each ROI, and of all ROI's combined will be used to compare the glycosaminoglycan content in the different knee compartments in the two groups. The lower mean T1Gd of the ROIs is desired outcome.</description>

    <description>Participant assessment of Activities of Daily Living (ADL). The KOOS ADL sub score is calculated as the mean score of the individual items (A1-A17) divided by 4 (the highest possible score for a single answer option) and multiplied by 100.
