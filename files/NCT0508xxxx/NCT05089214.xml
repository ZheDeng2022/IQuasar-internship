    <textblock>
      This study is about the assessment of two oral telemedecine tools compared to an intra oral&#xD;
      clinical examination used as a reference among elderly persons living in nursing home. Our&#xD;
      hyposthesis is that the diagnostic performance of the two devices will be similar.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main goal of the study is to assess the performances of two intra-oral cameras compared&#xD;
      to an intra oral clinical examination to detect at least one decayed tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of this study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
      At patient's level:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the performances of two intra-oral cameras types compared to an intra oral&#xD;
           clinical examination for detecting each of the following conditions: (i) at least one&#xD;
           filled tooth, (ii) at least one missing tooth, (iii) gingivitis, (iv) an abscess, (v)&#xD;
           dental plaque and (vi) calculous&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the concordance between each intra oral cameras and the intra oral clinical&#xD;
           examination in the evaluation of the number (i) of decayed teeth, (ii) filled teeth and&#xD;
           (iii) missing tooth&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. From video acquisitions of each intra oral cameras, to assess the inter-observer&#xD;
           concordance for the diagnostic of each dental pathologies (presence of at least one&#xD;
           decayed tooth, filled or missing) and periodontal (presence of gingivitis, abscess,&#xD;
           dental plaque or scale)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. From video acquisitions of each intra oral cameras, to assess the inter-observer&#xD;
           agreement of the number of teeth: (i) decayed, (ii) filled and (ii) missing&#xD;
&#xD;
           At tooth level :&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To assess the performances of two intra-oral cameras types compared to an intra oral&#xD;
           clinical examination for detecting each of the following conditions: (i) a cavity, (ii)&#xD;
           a filled tooth and (iii) missing tooth&#xD;
&#xD;
           In all patients :&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To assess patient's feelings about the use of each intra oral cameras&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. To compare the time required for video acquisitions between each of intra oral cameras&#xD;
&#xD;
      For patients with dental or periodontal pathologies observed during the intra oral&#xD;
      examination:&#xD;
&#xD;
      8 To assess, 2 months after initial evaluation, the proportion of patients attended dental or&#xD;
      periodontal care and for which an appointment with a dentist has been scheduled&#xD;
