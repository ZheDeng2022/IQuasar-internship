  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to develop methodology to monitor flux in the citric acid cycle in brain via 13C&#xD;
      nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy at 7 Tesla.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to establish a protocol to 13C-label (from 13C-glucose) several physiological&#xD;
      molecules: glucose, lactate, pyruvate and derived compounds. All of these molecules can&#xD;
      undergo oxidation in the citric acid cycle. The intent is to study the 13C labeling pattern&#xD;
      of these molecules in control and G1D subjects to determine if downstream products (such as&#xD;
      13C bicarbonate or 13C glutamate) due to oxidation in the mitochondria can be detected in&#xD;
      brain or in blood by NMR analysis. While inside the instrument, the subjects may also undergo&#xD;
      a 7T MR exam to correlate spectroscopy with brain structure.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Adolescents and adults with previously documented diagnosis of Glut1 Deficiency with&#xD;
             diagnosis genetically confirmed or confirmed by PET scan of the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Ages 16 to 65&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Persons with dental fillings, dental crowns, and short (max.4 cm) dental retainer&#xD;
             wires can be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. People or patients with uncontrolled seizure disorder, defined as grand mal (not&#xD;
             absence) seizure in the preceding 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Pregnant females will be excluded. A serum or urine pregnancy test will be&#xD;
             administered to all females of child bearing potential within 24 hours of&#xD;
             administration of the tracer and MRI scan. The pregnancy test will be communicated in&#xD;
             person by the study PI. Positive results in subjects 17 years old or younger will be&#xD;
             disclosed to parent/guardian only.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with typical implanted orthopedic metal in bone may be considered for&#xD;
             inclusion in a 7T scan providing the implant is not within the volume of the radio&#xD;
             frequency coil. The PI and the AIRC Medical Director will discuss each case and&#xD;
             determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Persons with ICD, pacemakers, neurostimulators and other such devices will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Persons with claustrophobia are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Persons with questionable ferrous implants, bullets, BB's, and shrapnel will be&#xD;
             excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects who are not fluent in English will be excluded because immediate cooperation&#xD;
             and the ability to respond to instructions from the investigators are necessary.&#xD;
