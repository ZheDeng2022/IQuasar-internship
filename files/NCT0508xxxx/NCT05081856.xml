  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      in this study, it was aimed to examine the effect of the modular carrying system on the&#xD;
      outcomes of care in the mobilization of patients with a chest tube. The population of the&#xD;
      study consisted of patients followed in Yedikule Chest Diseases, and Thoracic Surgery&#xD;
      Training and Research Hospital between October 2019 and January 2021, and the sample&#xD;
      consisted of 83 patients who met the inclusion criteria. The study was performed with the&#xD;
      intervention group (n=37) mobilized with the Modular medical equipment carrying vehicle and&#xD;
      the control group (n=46) mobilized with the routine application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Within the scope of the study, a Modular medical equipment carrying vehicle was developed by&#xD;
      the researchers to ensure the safe and comfortable mobilization of patients with chest tube&#xD;
      and additional medical equipment. This vehicle has been designed to maintain the level of the&#xD;
      chest tube during mobilization and to prevent it from tipping over.Patients in the&#xD;
      intervention group were mobilized with the help of this Modular medical equipment carrying&#xD;
      vehicle for 20 minutes at least 6 times a day. Patients in the control group were mobilized&#xD;
      at least 6 times a day for 20 minutes with clinical routine practice.&#xD;
