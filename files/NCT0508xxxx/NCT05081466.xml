  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hip fracture is a common serious injury in older women that reduces quality of life and can&#xD;
      lead to premature death. In the United Kingdom, hip fractures are estimated to account for&#xD;
      1.5 million hospital bed days used per year due to long hospitalisation and rehabilitation&#xD;
      periods post-surgery, costing the National Health Service over Â£1 billion per year. Diet can&#xD;
      affect bone health and risk of hip fracture, with varying risks in women on specific diets,&#xD;
      and specific foods and nutrients playing more important roles than others. Vegetarians may be&#xD;
      at a greater risk of hip fracture than meat-eaters, and those who don't consume enough&#xD;
      protein could be at a greater risk than those with adequate intakes. This research aims to&#xD;
      investigate which dietary factors (and in what quantities) might predispose United Kingdom&#xD;
      women to a greater risk of hip fracture, and which factors may be protective. The purpose of&#xD;
      this study is to better understand the role of diet in reducing hip fracture risk in United&#xD;
      Kingdom women. The research will use existing dietary and lifestyle data from the United&#xD;
      Kingdom Women's Cohort Study and hospital records of hip fractures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Hip fracture is an increasingly prevalent global health condition that increases&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Previous observational studies have shown potential for risk&#xD;
      reduction through diet modification, but associations between many dietary factors and hip&#xD;
      fracture incidence are uncertain, and evidence in United Kingdom populations is limited.&#xD;
      Therefore, this study aims to assess associations between diet and hip fracture incidence in&#xD;
      the United Kingdom Women's Cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research plan and methods: The investigators will utilise dietary and lifestyle data from the&#xD;
      United Kingdom Women's Cohort which recruited 35,372 middle-aged women between 1995-1998.&#xD;
      This data has been linked with Hospital Episode Statistics to provide hip fracture data of&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cox regression models will be applied to explore potential associations between dietary&#xD;
      factors and hip fracture incidence. Dietary factors will be modelled both as categorical and&#xD;
      continuous so that models can be fit comparing the risk of hip fracture between categories of&#xD;
      intakes and per increment increase in exposure intake (linear dose-response). Cubic splines&#xD;
      will be used to model non-linear associations for dietary intake of fruits, vegetables, tea,&#xD;
      and coffee since previous research has suggested possible non-linear associations for these&#xD;
      variables.&#xD;
