  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a global multicenter designed Phase II/III clinical trial. The objectives of&#xD;
      Phase II stage are to evaluate the safety and immunogenicity of recombinant two-component&#xD;
      COVID-19 vaccine (CHO cell) (ReCOV) in adults, 300 participants plan to be enrolled. The&#xD;
      objectives of Phase III stage are to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of&#xD;
      ReCOV in adults, estimate 20001 participants. Two-dose intramuscular vaccination schedule (21&#xD;
      days interval) will be applied in both Phase II and Phase III stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase I study of ReCOV was initiated in June 2021 in New Zealand. This is a first in&#xD;
      human (FIH) study to evaluate the safety, reactogenicity, and immunogenicity of 2 ascending&#xD;
      doses of ReCOV vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Phase II stage is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial. About 300&#xD;
      participants aged 18 years and older (participants ≥ 60 years old will account for about 15%)&#xD;
      who do not have known Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) or COVID-19 vaccination history&#xD;
      will be randomized into recombinant two-component COVID-19 vaccine (ReCOV) group (40 μg) or&#xD;
      placebo group in a ratio of 2:1. Accordingly, 200 participants will receive 40 μg ReCOV and&#xD;
      100 participants will receive matching placebo, respectively. Participants will be stratified&#xD;
      by age (18-59 years, ≥ 60 years), study country and status of Severe acute respiratory&#xD;
      syndrome coronavirus 2(SARS-CoV-2) antibody at baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III stage is a global multicenter, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      cross-over design to evaluate the efficacy, safety, and immunogenicity of ReCOV in adults&#xD;
      aged 18 years and older who do not have known history of COVID-19 or COVID-19 vaccination&#xD;
      history.The primary analysis will be performed when 151 endpoint cases have been observed.&#xD;
      One Interim analysis(IA) will be conducted when 66.7% of the total target number of endpoint&#xD;
      cases (101 endpoint cases) have been achieved. If the Interim analysis (IA) has demonstrated&#xD;
      success of the protection or if the target number of cases have been achieved (whichever&#xD;
      occurs first), the Period 2 could be initiated accordingly. In Period 2, the participant will&#xD;
      be blindly exchanged to receive the alternative interventions, i.e., who have received&#xD;
      placebo in Period 1 will be vaccinated with ReCOV on Day 0 and Day 21 in Period 2, while&#xD;
      those have received ReCOV in Period 1 will receive placebo with the same schedule. All&#xD;
      participants and study investigators will remain blinded throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an efficacy-immunogenicity subgroup to evaluate the immunogenicity including&#xD;
      the immune persistence. The efficacy-immunogenicity subgroup will account for about 7% of the&#xD;
      total number of participants. Approximately the first enrolled 1400 participants will be&#xD;
      included in the efficacy-immunogenicity subgroup.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For reactogenicity visits, participants will be observed for 30 minutes after each&#xD;
      vaccination at study site for collecting solicited or unsolicited (Adverse events)AEs.&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to record solicited AEs within 7 days after each vaccination. At 7&#xD;
      days after the 2nd immunization, each participant needs to submit the subject diaries to&#xD;
      study site on the same day. For safety visits, participants need to record unsolicited AEs&#xD;
      from the 1st dose to 28 days after the 2nd vaccination. From the 1st dose to 6 months (180&#xD;
      days) after the 2nd vaccination, the occurrence of SAEs and AESIs(Adverse event of special&#xD;
      interest) will be monitored.&#xD;
