      Multi-cohort exploratory prospective study. Participation in the ALCINA 4 study does not&#xD;
      change the standard management of the patient, including the treatments administered. A&#xD;
      sampling schedule will be set up for each cohort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the clinical context studied and the biomarkers studied and/or sought, the&#xD;
      timing of blood samples will vary between cohorts. There may be up to 4 samples taken per&#xD;
      patient for up to 12 or 18 months. If a specific tumor sample is required, it will be&#xD;
      collected only once during the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ALCINA 4 study is a prospective biological cohort study based on the analysis of&#xD;
      circulating tumour biomarkers obtained by blood sampling, with comparison - if necessary -&#xD;
      with tumour material obtained by biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Circulating tumour biomarkers in blood have been the subject of much research for several&#xD;
      decades, leading to the development in the 1980s of serum protein markers still in use today&#xD;
      (CA15.3, ACE, CA125...). In the last decade, research has focused on circulating tumour cells&#xD;
      (CTCs), circulating endothelial cells (CECs) and more recently on the detection of&#xD;
      circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA) and exosomes (or microvesicles). While ctDNA seems to have a&#xD;
      very promising future, other circulating elements such as microRNA are also part of what&#xD;
      can/will be studied from a simple blood sample. Broadly speaking, the potential clinical&#xD;
      interests of these circulating biomarkers are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  diagnostic (diagnosis of cancer, or especially diagnosis of genetic mutations present in&#xD;
           a known cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  prognostic (to adapt the intensity of treatment to the expected outcome of the patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  predictive of the efficacy of targeted therapies (according to the mutational profile of&#xD;
           the cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study mechanisms of resistance during treatment . The multiplicity of these potential&#xD;
           blood biomarkers is matched by a large number of detection techniques, for example for&#xD;
           CTCs or ctDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The major new challenge in research on circulating biomarkers is to replace molecular&#xD;
      analyses on tumour tissue obtained by biopsy (e.g. the search for somatic cancer mutations)&#xD;
      by a simple blood sample (&quot;liquid biopsy&quot;). This objective, which is technologically possible&#xD;
      in the very short term and particularly interesting - both medically (for patients) and&#xD;
      economically - requires the comparison of data from blood markers with those from tumour&#xD;
      tissue samples. Furthermore, there is an important trend to combine several levels of&#xD;
      analysis together (e.g. ctDNA and serum protein markers) to refine the performance of blood&#xD;
      tests.&#xD;

    <description>Detecting residual disease after surgery is absolutely crucial in oncology, as this detection could allow the personalisation of post-operative treatments based on the presence of residual disease.&#xD;
The laboratory wishes to develop a new technique for the detection of circulating tumour DNA, based on the recognition of translocation fragments in circulating DNA by shallow whole genome sequencing. This is an original approach, which to our knowledge has not been tested so far with the envisaged bioinformatics approach and could potentially be more sensitive than the techniques currently used to detect residual disease after surgical removal of localised (non-metastatic) breast cancer.&#xD;
The analysis will therefore focus on the search for tumour chromosomal translocations, which will need to be differentiated from possible germline chromosomal translocations. The collection of constitutional DNA is therefore planned in this cohort.</description>

    <arm_group_label>Cohort 2: Response to chemoimmunotherapy in triple negative breast cancer</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Other</arm_group_type>
    <description>The aim for this cohort is to study the role that variations in circulating tumour DNA might have as a marker associated with response during chemoimmunotherapy.&#xD;
A fresh biopsy (subsequently stored frozen) is required for mutational profiling analysis (which will be used to track circulating tumour DNA in the blood). In addition, it will be used to analyse currently recognised biological tissue factors of response to chemoimmunotherapy (PD-L1 labelling, mutational load, ...) and to identify possible associations with circulating tumour DNA variations.&#xD;
Constitutional DNA analysis is necessary for the determination of point mutations present in the tumour (to be differentiated from polymorphisms present at the constitutional level), as the determination of these mutations is essential to monitor circulating tumour DNA and will therefore be collected.</description>
