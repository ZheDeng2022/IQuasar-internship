  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-arm randomized controlled trial to compare telephone-based depression&#xD;
      self-management (UPLIFT) to telephone-based support groups (BOOST). A sample of 120 English-&#xD;
      and Spanish-speaking people with epilepsy (PWE) with elevated depressive symptoms will be&#xD;
      enrolled. Both interventions are 8-week programs delivered in one-hour weekly sessions to&#xD;
      groups of about 6 participants. Changes in depressive symptoms, quality of life and seizures&#xD;
      will be assessed over 12 months. The trial will also examine mediators and moderators of&#xD;
      treatment effects.&#xD;

      The objectives of the trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To test effects of UPLIFT versus BOOST on changes in depressive symptoms (primary&#xD;
           outcome) in PWE over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To test effects of UPLIFT versus BOOST on changes in quality of life and seizures&#xD;
           (secondary outcomes) in PWE over 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To test whether intervention effects are mediated by increases in mindfulness and&#xD;
           decreases in rumination.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To test whether intervention effects are moderated by participant characteristics and&#xD;
           facilitator characteristics.&#xD;

    <description>The primary outcome is a dichotomous measure of depressive symptoms based on a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) score of &lt;5 versus ≥5. The PHQ-9 assesses depressive symptoms in the past two weeks. Total scores range from 0-27 with recommended cutoffs for mild (5-9), moderate (10-14), moderately severe (15-19) and severe (≥20) depressive symptoms. A PHQ-9 score of &lt;5 indicates absence of clinically significant depressive symptoms.</description>

    <measure>Change in depressive symptom severity</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit, 3 month visit, 6 month visit, 12 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>Continuous PHQ-9 scores will be used to evaluate the magnitude of change in depressive symptoms. The PHQ-9 consists of nine questions that ask respondents how often they've &quot;been bothered by any of the following problems&quot; in the past two weeks. The questions address sleep, energy, appetite, and other possible symptoms of depression. Scores are calculated based on how frequently a person experiences these feelings. Score of 1-4 is considered minimal depression; score of 5-9 is considered mild depression; score of 10-14 is considered moderate depression; score of 15-19 is considered moderately severe depression; score of 20-27 is considered severe depression.</description>

    <description>This will be assessed by the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS-10) questionnaire, a 10-item measure of global health (physical, mental and social functioning) developed by NIH as an indicator for Healthy People 2020. The PROMIS Global-10 is a 10-item patient-reported questionnaire in which the response options are presented as 5-point (as well as a single 11-point) rating scales. The results of the questions are used to calculate two summary scores: a Global Physical Health Score and a Global Mental Health score. These scores are then standardized to the general population, using the &quot;T-Score&quot;. The average &quot;T-Score&quot; for the United States population is 50 points, with a standard deviation of 10 points. Higher scores indicate a healthier patient.</description>

    <measure>Change in perceived stress</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline Visit, 3 month visit, 6 month visit, 12 month visit</time_frame>
    <description>This will be assessed by the Perceived Stress Scale, a 10-item measure of the degree which situations in one's life are appraised as overwhelming, uncontrollable and unpredictable over the last month. The Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) is a classic stress assessment instrument. Scores ranging from 0-13 would be considered low stress. Scores ranging from 14-26 would be considered moderate stress. Scores ranging from 27-40 would be considered high perceived stress.</description>

    <description>This will be assessed by the Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale, a 7-item measure of anxiety symptoms in the past two weeks that is used to screen for clinically significant anxiety. This is calculated by assigning scores of 0, 1, 2, and 3 to the response categories, respectively, of &quot;not at all,&quot; &quot;several days,&quot; &quot;more than half the days,&quot; and &quot;nearly every day.&quot; GAD-7 total score for the seven items ranges from 0 to 21.
