  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eligible participants who were active beneficiaries of a large insurer living in Pennsylvania&#xD;
      were sent an email encouraging them to download the contact tracing app in Pennsylvania,&#xD;
      COVID Alert PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to one of four conditions in a 2 (Self-benefit vs.&#xD;
      Other-Benefit) x 2 (Social Norms Present vs. Social Norms absent) design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants received an email that said :&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;COVID Alert PA is the official Exposure Notification App from the Pennsylvania Department of&#xD;
      Health. Join Penn Medicine in the fight against COVID-19 and download COVID Alert PA today!&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      ---Investigators manipulated the content here---&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;The app uses Bluetooth to sense when one person is in close contact with another person with&#xD;
      the app. If someone tests positive for COVID-19, and they decide to upload the information to&#xD;
      the health department, people who have the app and who have been in contact with them will be&#xD;
      alerted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are interested in downloading the app, please click COVID Alert PA. We appreciate you&#xD;
      joining our efforts. Together we can beat COVID-19!&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Other-Benefit condition, it said: &quot;It can help you reduce your risk of unknowingly&#xD;
      spreading the virus to your friends, family, and larger community.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Self-Benefit condition, it said: &quot;It can help you determine where and when to get&#xD;
      testing, and how to get care if you need it.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Social Norms Present condition, it said: &quot;Over 650,000 Pennsylvanians have already&#xD;
      downloaded the app!&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Social Norms Absent condition, it said the statement about social norms above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who do not open the initial email received a follow-up email.&#xD;
