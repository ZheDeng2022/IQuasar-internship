      Abstract: Antineoplastic therapy (AT) is one of the most used treatment modalities to fight&#xD;
      cancer, either curatively or palliatively. There are several possible routes of&#xD;
      administration, but the intravenous is the most used for its safe absorption and maintenance&#xD;
      of the drug's serum level (1). Among the central catheters used in oncology, the long-term&#xD;
      Totally Implantable (CTI) catheter is one of the most well accepted by patients and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals. Being used in the administration of fluids, medication, parenteral&#xD;
      nutrition or to obtain blood. Maintaining the CTI is essential to maintain its permeability,&#xD;
      and thus, its proper functioning (2-4). The COVID-19 pandemic requires several readjustments&#xD;
      from health institutions to ensure healthy environments for patients and less exposure to the&#xD;
      hospital environment, one of the measures to focus on increasing the maintenance time of the&#xD;
      ICU from 30 to 60 days. Objective: To verify the safety of increasing the maintenance&#xD;
      interval of the Port-a-Cath catheter from 30 to 60 days through the rate of infection,&#xD;
      obstruction, dysfunction in the infusion of solutions and blood reflux at the end of a year&#xD;
      of follow-up. Method: This is an observational study, a single research arm, with a scheduled&#xD;
      duration from January 2021 to August 2022 at the chemotherapy clinics of the A.C.Camargo&#xD;
      Cancer Center. Expected results: This investigation is expected to demonstrate that&#xD;
      maintenance with saline every 60 days does not increase obstruction or infection in patients&#xD;
      who are in clinical follow-up compared to maintenance for 30 days.&#xD;

      1.Patients and methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.1. Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment will take place during three months in the chemotherapy ambulatory at A.C.&#xD;
      Camargo Cancer Center. Patients will be invited to participate in this study once they&#xD;
      undergo maintenance of the fully implanted catheter (FIC), according to institutional&#xD;
      routine. If the invited patient meets the inclusion and exclusion criteria defined in this&#xD;
      study, he will respond to the financial assessment (Appendix 1). In the next step, he will be&#xD;
      instructed to wait for the researcher to contact him to inform the next day of catheter&#xD;
      maintenance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the clinical findings and randomization assessment, the patient will be informed to&#xD;
      which group he belongs and he will be responsible for scheduling the next maintenance&#xD;
      appointment, according to the group to which he belongs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study researcher will be responsible for checking if all participants have planned and&#xD;
      carried out their maintenance according to his group. He will make sure that they underwent&#xD;
      the catheter maintenance in the recommended time period. The study will consist of two arms,&#xD;
      with the control group consisting of patients undergoing catheter care every 60 days as&#xD;
      recommended in the current institutional protocol. The experimental group will consist of&#xD;
      patients who will have a maintenance every 90 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed up for one year, with those randomized to the control group having&#xD;
      6 appointments and the experimental group having 4 appointments, in addition to the&#xD;
      recruitment period. During follow-up, nurses responsible for this procedure will evaluate the&#xD;
      development of specific mechanical complications related to the catheter. A graduated scale&#xD;
      of 1 to 5 will be applied: Grade 1 - no resistance to saline infusion with venous return;&#xD;
      Grade 2 - no resistance to saline infusion without venous return; Grade 3 - resistance to&#xD;
      saline infusion with venous return; Grade 4 - resistance to saline infusion without venous&#xD;
      return; Grade 5 - inability to infuse saline without venous return (obstructed). This rating&#xD;
      will be recorded on the puncture procedure form already available in the health sector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the patient´s cases that will present obstruction in the totally implanted catheter, they&#xD;
      will be forwarded to the emergency service. So, the medical teams will evaluate them to&#xD;
      verify any possibility to use tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA). In cases of catheter&#xD;
      infection, the patient will follow the institutional routine guide of treatment. The puncture&#xD;
      procedure will follow the institutional pattern that was validated with the Hospital&#xD;
      Infection Control Service.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.2. Data assessment This study is expected to enrol 410 patients, 205 in the control group&#xD;
      and 205 in the experimental group. This evaluation will be performed using the power test&#xD;
      with 80% , significance level of 5%, and a rate of 1.35% in obstruction in the control group&#xD;
      based on a retrospective study (8) and 2.0% of obstruction in the experimental group with&#xD;
      study margin of 2.5% (14).&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are no studies indicating the obstruction rate for the experimental group, so an&#xD;
      estimate was made to find the calculated values. If the volume was not collected in the first&#xD;
      few months as planned, recruitment may be extended to the two years of this study, during&#xD;
      which time as many patients as possible will be recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the randomization, sequential allocation will be applied (15). As a confusing variable,&#xD;
      will be controlled gender and age. As a tool of randomization, an institutional website will&#xD;
      be used https://estatsaude.shinyapps.io/alocacao/.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients have &quot;intention to treat&quot; and they will be analyzed in the groups they were in&#xD;
      until the end of this study. Patients who have more than one event will be counted in each&#xD;
      event of the analysis. After data collection, a descriptive analysis will be made. Then the&#xD;
      absolute frequency of distribution and relative for qualitative variables and the main&#xD;
      measures such as mean, median, and standard deviation and minimum and maximum for&#xD;
      quantitative variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to evaluate a possible association between two qualitative variables, the&#xD;
      independence test ( Chi-Square Test or Fisher's exact test) will be used. To compare&#xD;
      quantitative variables concerning two independent groups, a non-parametric test of&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney or T-test will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Logistic regression models will be applied to evaluate association with clinical and&#xD;
      socioeconomic variables of groups between those who will presented or not will presented&#xD;
      obstruction of infection of the catheter. The adopted level of significance will be of 5% and&#xD;
      the SPSS® for Windows® program, version 22.0 will be used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.3. Expected Results This study aims to demonstrate that saline maintenance every 90 days&#xD;
      compared with 60-days maintenance does not result in more obstructions or infections in&#xD;
      patients undergoing clinical follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1.4. Possible limitations of this study&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main limitations of this study are that it is a single center study, recruitment&#xD;
      difficulty, and decreasing number of participants during follow-up.&#xD;
