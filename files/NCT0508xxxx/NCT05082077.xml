      The objective of this registry is to collect and evaluate various clinical effectiveness&#xD;
      parameters in patients with transplanted donor liver that were preserved and transported&#xD;
      within the LIVERguard system, as well as retrospective standard of care patients&#xD;

      GUARDIAN-Liver is a post-market, observational registry of adult and pediatric liver&#xD;
      transplant recipient patients whose donor liver was preserved and transported within the&#xD;
      LIVERguard. The data is being collected retrospectively from medical records of patients&#xD;
      already transplanted before the initiation of the registry and any new patients who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 1000 male and female subjects meeting the study inclusion and exclusion criteria will&#xD;
      be enrolled into the study at about 20 clinical sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Candidates that fit the eligibility criteria and have had their donor liver transported with&#xD;
      a Paragonix product or a standard of care method can be enrolled. The baseline&#xD;
      characteristics and outcomes of the two groups will be compared.&#xD;
