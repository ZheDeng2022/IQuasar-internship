  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will follow patients diagnosed with atopic dermatitis (AD), also known as eczema,&#xD;
      to learn important information about how the disease and its treatments impact patients over&#xD;
      time. The study will attempt to help inform the best clinical management of patients with&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is a multi-center, longitudinal, observational study to describe Clinician Reported&#xD;
      Outcomes (ClinROs) and Patient Reported Outcomes (PROs) in AD patients. This study will&#xD;
      collect data using validated clinical instruments and patient-reported data on the disease&#xD;
      course of AD, including symptom assessments and Quality of Life (QoL) measures from a patient&#xD;
      perspective, to supplement routine clinical data collected from their healthcare providers.&#xD;
      ClinROs will be collected at baseline and at routine follow-up visits for up to two years.&#xD;
      PROs will be collected directly from patients at baseline and at 3-6 month intervals for the&#xD;
      duration of the study outside of clinic visits. In moderate-to-severe AD patients initiating&#xD;
      systemic therapy, an additional PRO time-point at 6 weeks will be included to better&#xD;
      understand early treatment effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To describe longitudinal changes in disease activity, symptom control and health-related&#xD;
           quality of life (HrQoL) based on both ClinROs and PROs&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To identify patient, disease and treatment factors associated with changes in PROs over&#xD;
           time&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To describe the association between PROs and clinical outcomes&#xD;
