      This randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, split-face clinical trial&#xD;
      was conducted to evaluate the procedure-pairing of OnabotulinumtoxinA with a peptide&#xD;
      anti-aging serum to improve facial lines and wrinkles, as well as overall skin texture and&#xD;
      radiance of the face after 12 weeks of twice-daily use in female subjects ages 35 - 60 as&#xD;
      compared to placebo. A total of 29 subjects completed study participation.&#xD;

      This randomized, multi-center, double-blinded, placebo-controlled, split-face clinical trial&#xD;
      was conducted to evaluate procedure pairing of a peptide anti-aging serum with&#xD;
      Onabotulinumtoxin A in the treatment of periorbital facial wrinkles when used over the course&#xD;
      of 12 weeks by women with moderate to severe crow's feet wrinkles and fine lines, and mild to&#xD;
      moderate photoaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy and tolerability will be assessed through clinical grading at baseline, weeks 4, 8&#xD;
      and 12. Efficacy evaluation for wrinkles, fine lines, and skin appearance will be graded at&#xD;
      rest and at maximum smile for each side. Investigator and subject tolerability,&#xD;
      self-assessment questionnaire and VISIA photography will be completed at baseline, weeks 4, 8&#xD;
      and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 29 subjects completed study participation.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Subjects left and right face (split face) will be randomly assigned to one of the following treatment arms: peptide antiaging serum vs placebo serum. The active and placebo will be placed in the same container and labelled Right and Left. Double blinded study, where the investigator, study subject, and other study personnel involved in the evaluation of the efficacy or safety are blinded to treatment during the twelve week randomization study. The investigational product will be identical in appearance to placebo and both will be packaged in the same container, which will be labelled Right and Left corresponding to the randomization.</masking_description>

    <measure>Clinical Efficacy Grading by Griffith's Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The primary efficacy endpoint will be the Investigator Clinical Grading using Modified Griffith's 10 point scale. A change in scores at Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 (+/- 3 days) in comparison to baseline indicates an improvement for the indicated parameter.&#xD;
The efficacy parameters will be assessed at rest and at maximum smile and at specific areas on both the left and right sides of the subjects face using a modified Griffith's 10 point scale according to the following numerical definitions (half point scores may be used as necessary to more accurately describe skin conditions)&#xD;
0 = None (best possible condition)&#xD;
1 to 3 = Mild 4 to 6 = Moderate 7 to 9 = Severe (worst possible condition). The lower the score equates to the best possible outcome.</description>

    <description>The primary tolerability endpoint will be Investigator Tolerability Assessment of erythema, edema, and dryness. A change in scores or lack of significant change at Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 in comparison to baseline indicates tolerability / safety of the test material. Four point scale with a lower score indicating a better outcome.&#xD;

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Self-Assessment Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The secondary efficacy endpoint will be the Self-Assessment Questionnaire. A change in response values at Day 28, Day 56, and Day 84 indicates and improvement compared to baseline response values. Subjects are asked to rate based on a scoring system of the following: from 5 (completely agree) to 1 (completely disagree). The best outcome is to Completely Agree with the statement / question being asked.</description>
