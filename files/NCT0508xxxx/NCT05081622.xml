  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Violence has severe and long-lasting negative consequences for children's and adolescents'&#xD;
      well-being and academic functioning, which can hinder communities' and societies' economic&#xD;
      growth. According to the Human Development Index, Haiti is one of the least developed&#xD;
      countries in the world and the least developed in the Western hemisphere. Although Haiti has&#xD;
      officially signed international and national laws aiming to protect children, preliminary&#xD;
      reports suggest high rates of violence against children at schools. In addition to a lack of&#xD;
      adequate training and supervision of teachers and an underdeveloped education system,&#xD;
      attitudes favoring violence against children as an effective and acceptable discipline method&#xD;
      and the lack of access to alternative non-violent strategies are likely to contribute to&#xD;
      teachers' ongoing use of violence against children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Notwithstanding, no school-level interventions addressing these factors to reduce violence by&#xD;
      teachers have been scientifically evaluated in Haiti so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the present study tests the effectiveness of the preventative intervention Interaction&#xD;
      Competencies with Children - for Teachers (ICC-T) in primary schools in Haiti. Previous&#xD;
      studies have provided initial evidence on the feasibility and effectiveness of ICC-T to&#xD;
      reduce teacher violence in primary and secondary schools in Tanzania and secondary schools in&#xD;
      Uganda. This study aims to provide first evidence for the effectiveness of ICC-T to reduce&#xD;
      violence and to improve children's functioning (i.e. mental health, well-being, academic&#xD;
      performance) in a cultural setting outside of Sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a two-arm cluster randomized controlled trial with schools&#xD;
      (clusters) as level of randomization. The study will be conducted in the Northern department&#xD;
      of Haiti. Two schools in each of the 19 communes will be randomly selected, resulting in a&#xD;
      total number of 38 schools.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In each commune, one school will be randomly allocated to the intervention group (that will&#xD;
      receive the ICC-T intervention) and one school to the control group (that will receive no&#xD;
      intervention). At each school, 28 students (stratified by gender) in the 4th grade of primary&#xD;
      School (between 9 and 11 years of age) and all teachers (at least 12) will be recruited.&#xD;
      Thus, the final sample will comprise 1064 students and at least 456 teachers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have three data assessment points: baseline assessment prior to the&#xD;
      intervention, the first follow-up assessment six months after the intervention and the second&#xD;
      follow-up assessment 18 months after the intervention. In addition, feasibility data will be&#xD;
      assessed in the intervention group at the beginning and the end of the intervention. Primary&#xD;
      outcome measures are student- and teacher-reported physical and emotional violence by&#xD;
      teachers in the past week. Secondary outcome measures include teachers' attitudes towards&#xD;
      violence against students, children's emotional and behavioral problems, quality of life, and&#xD;
      cognitive functioning.&#xD;
