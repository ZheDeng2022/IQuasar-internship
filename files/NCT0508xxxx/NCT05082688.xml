  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Vaccines are used to prevent infectious diseases worldwide. Unfortunately, many vaccines,&#xD;
      like the flu vaccine, are less effective in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This single-centre open label partially randomised, partially placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      evaluates the differences in immune response between young and older adults after vaccination&#xD;
      with a quadrivalent inactivated influenza vaccine and an adjuvanted herpes zoster&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploring the underlying mechanisms between the differences in immunogenicity can provide&#xD;
      important information for future vaccine development.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: Vaccination of the older adults is often advised as they are a high-risk&#xD;
      population; however, vaccine efficacy generally decreases with age. This is mainly due to a&#xD;
      decrease in adaptive immune responses known as immunosenescence, which is a factor&#xD;
      influencing the response to influenza vaccination. On the other hand, there are vaccines that&#xD;
      show high efficacy (more than 95%) in older adults, one of the most effective being the AS01&#xD;
      adjuvanted herpes zoster vaccine, Shingrix. The differential immune pathways associated with&#xD;
      vaccine responsiveness as well as the immune mechanisms by which adjuvants overcome&#xD;
      immunosenescence remain poorly understood. Targeting key immune pathways could be a way to&#xD;
      improve vaccine efficacy in older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To explore immunological features between young and older adults after&#xD;
      administration of an adjuvanted herpes zoster (Shingrix) or influenza unadjuvanted (Fluarix)&#xD;
      vaccine that could explain differences in vaccine immunogenicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A single centre open label, randomised, and partially placebo-controlled trial&#xD;
      Study population: Approximately 140 healthy adults, 80 of which are between 18-35 years old,&#xD;
      the other 60 are 65+ years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Two groups of young and elderly volunteers receive recombinant zoster vaccine&#xD;
      (Shingrix), while two other groups will receive a quadrivalent influenza vaccine (Fluarix).&#xD;
      Two groups of young volunteers will receive a placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameter: To identify immune senescence-related differences contributing to&#xD;
      vaccine immunogenicity&#xD;
