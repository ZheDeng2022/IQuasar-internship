      Aims of this study are to evaluate adolescents with celiac disease during their transition&#xD;
      from pediatrics to adult care, and to develop better healthcare follow-up practices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Celiac disease is one of the most common chronic gastrointestinal diseases affecting 1-3% of&#xD;
      population worldwide. It is treated with life-long and strict gluten-free diet. When dietary&#xD;
      treatment is successful, prognosis of pediatric patients seems to be excellent whereas&#xD;
      ongoing predisposition to gluten may increase the risk even to permanent complications.&#xD;
      However, gluten-free diet may cause burden and restrictions in everyday life impairing&#xD;
      quality of life. Regular follow-up is recommended to support the treatment and to detect&#xD;
      early possible comorbidities and complications, but, in practice, patients are often lost to&#xD;
      follow-up. Studies about the significance of follow-up and its optimal implementation are&#xD;
      scarce. Pediatric patients form a special group here as they may not even remember the reason&#xD;
      for the diagnosis if it was set in early childhood, and the education about the disease and&#xD;
      its treatment are often given primarily to the caregivers. Responsibility of the treatment&#xD;
      shifts to patients themselves in adolescence at the same time with other significant changes&#xD;
      in life and they have more often challenges with gluten-free diet than other patients.&#xD;
      Despite this, studies about the transition from pediatrics to adult-care are very few.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study evaluates 13-19 years old patients diagnosed with celiac disease in childhood (&lt;16&#xD;
      years of age) and compares them to adolescents without celiac disease in selected variables.&#xD;
      Study focuses on healthcare follow-up practices and pilot a CeliCAT transition form in a&#xD;
      randomized, controlled study design. The main hypothesis is that structured follow-up and&#xD;
      transition of pediatric patients to adult care predicts better health, quality of life and&#xD;
      adherence to the dietary treatment later in life. Data is collected with physical&#xD;
      examination, questionnaires and with blood and urine samples. Follow-up is arranged at one&#xD;
      and three years from the first visit.&#xD;
