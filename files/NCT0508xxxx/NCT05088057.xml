    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Camrelizumab plus&#xD;
      chemotherapy as neoadjuvant therapy and Camrelizumab as adjuvant therapy in participants who&#xD;
      have triple negative breast cancer (TNBC).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      After a screening phase of approximately 28 days, each participant will receive neoadjuvant&#xD;
      study treatment (camrelizumab + chemotherapy) for approximately 24 weeks (8 cycles). Each&#xD;
      participant will then undergo definitive surgery 2-4 weeks after the last cycle of the&#xD;
      neoadjuvant treatment. After definitive surgery, each participant will receive adjuvant study&#xD;
      treatment (camrelizumab) for approximately 27 weeks (9 cycles). Following adjuvant study&#xD;
      treatment, each participant will be monitored for safety, survival and disease recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary study hypothesis is that camrelizumab is superior to chemotherapy, in combination&#xD;
      with chemotherapy, as measured by the rate of Pathological Complete Response (pCR),&#xD;
      Event-free Survival (EFS) and Objective Overall Response Rate (ORR) in participants with&#xD;
      TNBC.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Pathological Complete Response (pCR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 12-30 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>pCR rate is defined as the percentage of participants without invasive cancer in the breast irrespective of ductal carcinoma in situ or nodal involvement following completion of neoadjuvant systemic therapy by current AJCC staging criteria assessed by the local pathologist at the time of definitive surgery in all participants</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Event-Free Survival (EFS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>EFS is defined as the time from start of study treatment to any of the following events: progression of disease that precludes surgery, local or distant recurrence, second primary malignancy (breast or other cancers) or death due to any cause.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Objective Overall Response Rate (ORR)</measure>
    <time_frame>[Time Frame: Up to approximately 12-30 weeks]</time_frame>
    <description>ORR was defined as percentage of participants with best (confirmed) overall response (BOR) of either CR or PR. ORR was assessed by the investigator according to RECIST version 1.1 and is based on BOR, which is defined as best response recorded from start of study treatment until definitive surgery or disease progression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Overall survival (OS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 2 years</time_frame>
    <description>OS is defined as the time from randomization to death due to any cause. Participants without documented death at the time of the analysis will be censored at the date of the last follow-up.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Adverse events (AEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 35 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>AEs were graded according to the National Cancer Institute's Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version 5.0. In general, AEs are graded according to the following: Grade 1 Mild AE Grade 2 Moderate AE Grade 3 Severe AE Grade 4 Life-threatening or disabling AE Grade 5 Death related to AE. The type, grade and frequency of AEs will be reported.</description>

    <measure>End point of exploratory study</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to approximately 35 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Correlation analysis and COX regression analysis were performed on pCR, EFS, ORR, OS of patients with basal cell-like subtypes (BL1, BL2), Luminal androgenic type (LAR), and other types.</description>
