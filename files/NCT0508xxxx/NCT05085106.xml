  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate the safety and tolerability of felbinac trometamol eye drops of single-dose,&#xD;
      multiple-dose, dose escalation in healthy subjects, for providing the basis for the dose&#xD;
      setting in the later clinical study.&#xD;

      In the single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-dose dose&#xD;
      escalation study, 48 healthy volunteers will be divided from low dose to high dose into 5&#xD;
      single-dose groups of 0.025%, 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%, with both male and female subjects&#xD;
      in each group. The study was designed as double-blind, all the single-dose groups containing&#xD;
      10 subjects except the single-dose group of 0.025% containing 8 subjects，and with 2 placebo&#xD;
      controls in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics blood sampling in different dose groups was designed from low dose to high&#xD;
      dose into 4 single-dose groups of 0.05%, 0.1%, 0.2% and 0.3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the single-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, multiple-dose dose&#xD;
      escalation study, 20 healthy volunteers will be divided into low dose and high dose groups of&#xD;
      0.1% and 0.2%, with both male and female subjects in each group. The study was designed as&#xD;
      double-blind, all the dose groups containing 8 subjects and 2 placebo controls.&#xD;
