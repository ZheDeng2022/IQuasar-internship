  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      vaccines for covid-19 are gold strategy and great achievement at this century for protection&#xD;
      against complications of covid-19 , development of many vaccines with different technology&#xD;
      represent a big challenge for this disease so the world live bad days and the vaccines save&#xD;
      world to see the light once again , mRNA based vaccines have a new technology which designed&#xD;
      before for cancer therapy, this technology is very effective , producible and fast for future&#xD;
      disease targets but these vaccine must contain excipients for preservation of this technology&#xD;
      mRNA so we now study these side effects of excipients and we suspect that polyethylene glycol&#xD;
      as excipients have big role at hypoglycemic effects with antidiabetic medications like&#xD;
      metformin and insulin especially at children and older age&#xD;

    <textblock>
      diabetics patients as chronic diseases represent high percentage at all the world and high&#xD;
      priority for vaccines against covid-19 so we will focus on these group as need more attention&#xD;
      and need best health and quality of life so my study concentrate on diabetics patients from&#xD;
      12 years to 80 years who were taken mRNA based vaccines and suffer from recurrent&#xD;
      hypoglycemia , i will check the blood glucose one month after the first or second injection&#xD;
      of mRNA based vaccines Pfizer or moderna vaccines and study all medicines taken by patients&#xD;
      and suspect what's happen is there is hypoglycemic effect or nor by following up the readings&#xD;
      of blood glucose by glucometers or CGM&#xD;
&#xD;
      there are previous studies about relation of metformin and polyethylene glycol injection and&#xD;
      this study conclude that The subcutaneous injection of PEX168 once a week can effectively,&#xD;
      continuously and safely improve HbA1c levels in patients with T2D when combined with&#xD;
      metformin ( Gao F, Lv X, Mo Z, Ma J, Zhang Q, Yang G, Liu W, Li Q, Zhou J, Bao Y, Jia W.&#xD;
      Efficacy and safety of polyethylene glycol loxenatide as add-on to metformin in patients with&#xD;
      type 2 diabetes: A multicentre, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, phase 3b trial.&#xD;
