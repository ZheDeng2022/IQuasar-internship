      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the 8-hour moisturization efficacy of OTC sunscreen&#xD;
      lip balm after a single treatment application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, randomized, controlled, intra-individual comparison, open label clinical&#xD;
      study to determine the 8-hour moisturization efficacy of a sunscreen lip balm. Skin hydration&#xD;
      will be assessed before (Baseline) and after (2, 4, 6 and 8 hours post-treatment) a single&#xD;
      treatment with test product, compared to 'no treatment' as control, using a corneometer.&#xD;
      Study treatments will be randomly assigned to 2 test sites delineated on the skin of the&#xD;
      participant's volar forearms (one test site on each arm). A 1-week conditioning phase will&#xD;
      precede the test day, during which participants will use the soap provided for personal&#xD;
      washing.&#xD;

    <measure>Mean Change from Baseline in Corneometry Measurements</measure>

    <description>Corneometry is an instrumental technique designed to measure changes in the capacitance of the skin resulting from changes in the degree of hydration; it is particularly sensitive to low hydration levels. Corneometry uses a capacitance sensor to measure the dielectric constant of the outer layers of the skin (stratum corneum). The dielectric constant is directly proportional to the water content of the skin (skin hydration). The capacitance of the skin surface is expressed in arbitrary units of skin hydration; the higher the corneometer reading, the more hydrated (moist) the skin. The mean of the 3 corneometer measurements obtained for each test site at each time point will be calculated for each participant. Change from Baseline will be calculated as post-Baseline assessment value minus the Baseline assessment value.</description>
