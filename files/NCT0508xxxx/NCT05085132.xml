  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      90% of Asian workers report high levels of stress in an &quot;always-on&quot; culture. Stress and&#xD;
      burnout are risk factors that account for 10-20% of health expenditure and threaten work&#xD;
      longevity in the world's fastest growing economies. Traditional face-to-face sources of&#xD;
      mental care such as counseling and psychotherapy are effective as a countermeasure to stress,&#xD;
      but not always accessible or acceptable for those with busy lifestyles. Because of this,&#xD;
      there is an urgent need for on-demand, scalable interventions to reduce stress and improve&#xD;
      mental and physical well being. Technology-based solutions are increasingly being proposed to&#xD;
      fill this need.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MindFi is a smartphone app that uses mindfulness exercises to help users cope with work&#xD;
      stress and increase productivity. Since 2017, it has been featured by Apple, BBC, and&#xD;
      Bloomberg and is being used at corporates such as Bain, Bloomberg, Cigna, and Zendesk. MindFi&#xD;
      users contribute behavioral and self-report data, which are then used to generate individual&#xD;
      recommendations for relevant, evidence-based exercises. These include mental care techniques&#xD;
      such as mindfulness meditation, therapeutic journaling, psychosocial support and educational&#xD;
      wellbeing quizzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will recruit 200 participants in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      design, with 100 receiving access to content of the MindFi app, and 100 receiving access to a&#xD;
      version containing music tracks for relaxation. Each intervention will last 4 weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will use these apps for a period of 5 weeks (for a minimum of 10 minutes per&#xD;
      day). Pre- and post-intervention, the investigators will measure self-reported ratings on a&#xD;
      number of psychological variables, and will track sleep quality objectively for a one-week&#xD;
      period.&#xD;

    <description>Digital wellness training in this study will be delivered via the MindFi app, designed by Jaedye Labs. Content includes learning, assesesment, and practice tracks A core component of the exercises in this app is mindfulness training; however, the app also incorporates other exercises drawn from positive psychology such as journaling and diaphragmatic breathing. The app goes beyond traditional guided meditation through content that reinforces the principles and attitudes taught during in-person training, and also seeks to maximize user experience by using interactive tasks and progress charts.</description>
