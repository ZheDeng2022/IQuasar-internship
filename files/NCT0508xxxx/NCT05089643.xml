    <description>Before breakfast, anlotinib hydrochloride capsule was taken on an empty stomach, once a day, 1 tablet (10mg) each time.Continuous oral administration for 2 weeks stopped for 1 week, that is, 3 weeks (21 days) as a treatment cycle, until disease progression or adverse reactions become intolerable.In case of missing medication, confirm that the time before the next medication is less than 12 hours, no refill.&#xD;
Capecitabine tablets 1000 mg/m2, twice a day, within 30min after meals, were taken orally for 2 consecutive weeks and stopped for 1 week, i.e., 3 weeks (21 days) as a treatment cycle until disease progression or adverse reactions became intolerable.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Female aged between 18 and 70;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Recurrence or metastasis OF TNBC confirmed by histological or cytological methods,&#xD;
             TNBC definitions of ER, PR and HER-2 are negative, if there is metastasis pathology,&#xD;
             the histological pathology of metastasis shall prevail.ER and PR negative were defined&#xD;
             as ER &lt; 10% positive and PR &lt; 10% positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Disease progression after at least one prior systemic treatment and anthracycline&#xD;
             and/or taxane use;Note: For neoadjuvant/adjuvant therapy, recurrence or disease&#xD;
             progression during treatment or within 6 months of discontinuation of treatment should&#xD;
             be counted as first-line systemic treatment failure;&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. There should be at least one measurable lesion according to the efficacy evaluation&#xD;
             criteria for solid tumors (RECIST version 1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. The number of previous treatment lines (including postoperative adjuvant therapy) &gt;4&#xD;
             lines&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. symptomatic central system metastases.Patients with stable asymptomatic BMS who have&#xD;
             received brain radiation and who have at least one other evaluable target in addition&#xD;
             to the BMS can be enrolled (evaluable target should be at least 4 weeks away from the&#xD;
             last radiotherapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. New bisphosphonate or dinoselmer treatment for bone metastases was initiated within 28&#xD;
             days prior to study initiation.(Subjects are permitted if they have already been&#xD;
             treated with bisphosphonate or dinoselmer for at least 4 weeks of optimal stable&#xD;
             administration prior to study initiation.)Subjects already enrolled in this study may&#xD;
             begin treatment with bisphosphonate or dinoselmer for bone metastases after the first&#xD;
             post-treatment evaluation&#xD;
