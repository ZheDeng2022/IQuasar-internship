  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transforaminal epidural steroid injection (TFESI) has been increasingly preferred in patients&#xD;
      who can not benefit from conservative approach in the treatment of lumbosacral radiculopathic&#xD;
      pain due to lumbar disc herniation. The aim of our study is to evaluate the effect of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome on the treatment results of transforaminal epidural steroid injection in&#xD;
      patients with chronic radicular low back pain due to lumbar disc herniation.&#xD;
