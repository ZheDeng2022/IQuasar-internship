  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activation of the RIG-I innate immune pathway and increased expression of tumor antigens and&#xD;
      pro-immune genes by DEC-C during Nivolumab treatment may enhance the frequency and activity&#xD;
      of anti-tumor immune cells (CD4+ and CD8+ T-cells, NK cells) and reduce the frequency and&#xD;
      activity of immunosuppressive cells. This may increase the overall effectiveness and success&#xD;
      of Nivolumab treatment. This pilot clinical trial will demonstrate whether combinatorial&#xD;
      immunotherapeutic approaches that target epigenetic immune repression and RIG-I activity can&#xD;
      favorably alter the tumor immune cell microenvironment and benefit patients with mucosal&#xD;
      melanoma.&#xD;

      This is a Phase Ib/II investigator-initiated open label trial of the combination of DEC-C and&#xD;
      Nivolumab treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single-center study to be conducted at the University of Colorado Cancer Center&#xD;
      (UCHealth central campus). A complete and current listing of investigators, research&#xD;
      personnel, and research facilities participating in this study will be maintained throughout&#xD;
      the duration of this study on applicable study required forms such as an FDA Form 1572, the&#xD;
      COMIRB Research Personnel Form, and/or a UCCC Protocol Contact List, incorporated herein by&#xD;
      reference.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase Ib: Bayesian optimal interval (BOIN) design will be used to assess the RP2D during&#xD;
      phase 1b. The BOIN design is a model assistant approach used in phase I clinical trial for&#xD;
      finding the maximum tolerated dose (MTD). The investigators anticipate 7-12 patients treated&#xD;
      at the RP2D in Phase 1b dose de-escalation and the investigators consider that as the first&#xD;
      stage. If there is at least one response among the 7-12 patients, the trial will move on to&#xD;
      the second stage and enroll additional patients to reach a minimum of 16 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: The objective of Phase II is to preliminarily evaluate the efficacy and further&#xD;
      evaluate safety of the combination at the RP2D. The phase II cohort will enroll patients&#xD;
      using the established RP2D of DEC-C from the phase Ib portion in combination with standard&#xD;
      doses of Nivolumab. Patients treated at the RP2D in Phase 1b will be included in analysis for&#xD;
      the Phase II component of this study. All patients enrolled at the RP2D level and receiving&#xD;
      at least 2 treatment cycles will be included in the efficacy and safety/tolerability endpoint&#xD;
      analysis. Our results indicate that the objective response rate (ORR) to anti-PD1 in mucosal&#xD;
      melanoma patients at our institution is 8%. The investigator hypothesize ORR for the&#xD;
      combination will be 33%, a 25% absolute improvement over the anti-PD1 treatment. Simon's&#xD;
      2-stage design will be used to evaluate the ORRs (28). The null hypothesis that the ORR is 8%&#xD;
      will be rejected if there are 4 or more responses among the 16 patients. The design yields a&#xD;
      type I error rate of 0.032 and power of 80% when the true response rate is 33%. The total&#xD;
      sample size required for the Phase II will depend on the number of patients treated at the&#xD;
      RP2D during Phase 1b, and it is estimated the total sample size will be in the range of 16-21&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;

             Flu-Mist®) are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must not have a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy or&#xD;
             laboratory abnormality that might confound the trial results, interfere with the&#xD;
             patient's participation for the full duration of the trial, or indicate that&#xD;
             participation in the trial is not in the patient's best interests, in the opinion of&#xD;
             the treating investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients must not be pregnant or lactating.&#xD;
