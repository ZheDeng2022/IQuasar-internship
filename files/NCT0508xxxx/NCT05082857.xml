      Young Moms Program (YMP) is designed to address systemic barriers to the health and stability&#xD;
      of young moms and their children such as the lack of coordination of service delivery or&#xD;
      logistical barriers within the health system. The YMP also streamlines the referral pipeline,&#xD;
      connecting moms to evidence-based resources, and ensuring children complete all recommended&#xD;
      assessments prior to kindergarten.&#xD;

      This application is a community-engaged research collaboration between the non-profit&#xD;
      Imprints Cares, the Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center (WFBMC) Birth Center, and Wake Forest&#xD;
      School of Medicine (WFSOM). This project addresses the myriad risks associated with young&#xD;
      moms ≤ 21 years old. Because YMP is a tiered program model, services meet parents where they&#xD;
      are through a &quot;warm hand-off&quot; approach that uses one-on-one consultation and assessment-based&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;

Young moms will participate in Group Connections for peer interactions and support. After completing the six-week course, teens will begin receiving once a month home visits, ongoing Group Connections, age-appropriate health and developmental screenings, and referrals that reflect mother and infant needs to other community agencies and resources, as listed above. The study team will collect baseline data prior to the beginning of the virtual What You Do Matters program and will complete monthly questionnaires during each month the mother is enrolled. An outcome assessment and participation in a focus group will be administered the last month of the study.</description>
