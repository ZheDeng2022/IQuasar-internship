  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A conversion disorder is a dysfunction of the nervous system in which no structural or&#xD;
      organic damage can be demonstrated. However, it must be distinguished from other psychiatric&#xD;
      disorders such as psychosis or depression. There are a variety of signs of the disease, such&#xD;
      as muscle paralysis, uncontrolled tremors or cramps. In rarer cases, blindness, deafness or&#xD;
      numbness may occur. Diagnosing this complex disorder has always been a challenge for&#xD;
      neurologists and psychiatrists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study investigates the effects of transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) on the general&#xD;
      well-being and symptoms of conversion disorder and other neurological disorders and in&#xD;
      comparison to healthy subjects. The TMS method allows to target specific areas of the brain&#xD;
      by means of magnetic fields. This technique is not painful and does not have long-lasting&#xD;
      effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, the study investigates the effects of mindfulness-based stress reduction on the&#xD;
      general well-being and symptoms of conversion disorder and other neurological disorders and&#xD;
      compared to healthy subjects. This technique is not painful and has no long-lasting effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study includes a maximum of seven sessions in total (five sessions of approximately 1.5-2&#xD;
      hours each and two sessions each overnight). The planned study methods include TMS, Magnetic&#xD;
      resonance tomography of the brain (MRI &quot;tube&quot;), questionnaires, blood, saliva, and motion&#xD;
      sensors (e.g., fitness bracelet), and participation in the 8-week mindfulness program.&#xD;
