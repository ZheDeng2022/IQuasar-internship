      Popular topic: Clinical study on immunogenicity and safety evaluation of sequentially&#xD;
      enhanced immunity with recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) Research&#xD;
      purpose:Main purpose:To evaluate the immunogenicity of recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine&#xD;
      (CHO cells) after sequential booster immunization in populations vaccinated with two doses of&#xD;
      marketed Novel Coronavirus inactivated vaccine.Secondary purpose:To evaluate the safety of&#xD;
      recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) after sequential booster immunization in&#xD;
      populations vaccinated with two doses of marketed Novel Coronavirus inactivated vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall design:An open experimental design was used in this study Study population:The study&#xD;
      involved people 18 years of age and older. Test groups: All subjects recruited must have&#xD;
      received two doses of Novel Coronavirus inactivated vaccine for 3 to 13 months (the interval&#xD;
      between booster and basic immunization is divided into 3 groups:120 subjects at 3-4 months&#xD;
      (91-120 days), 6-8 months (181-240 days) and 11-13 months (331-390 days) were vaccinated with&#xD;

      Overall design: An open experimental design was adopted in this study, and 360 subjects were&#xD;
      planned to be enrolled.To evaluate the immunogenicity and safety of recombinant Novel&#xD;
      Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells) after sequential booster immunization in populations&#xD;
      vaccinated with two doses of marketed Novel Coronavirus inactivated vaccine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: This study involved people 18 years of age and older.All subjects recruited&#xD;
      must have received two doses of Novel Coronavirus inactivated vaccine for 3 to 13 months (the&#xD;
      interval between booster and basic immunization is divided into 3 groups:120 subjects at 3-4&#xD;
      months (91-120 days), 6-8 months (181-240 days) and 11-13 months (331-390 days) were&#xD;
      vaccinated with one dose of recombinant Novel Coronavirus vaccine (CHO cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immunogenicity observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples were collected from all subjects before and 14 days after experimental vaccine&#xD;
      vaccination for humoral immunoassay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety observation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AE and SAE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collect all adverse events (AE) at least 30 minutes after vaccination, all AE (both&#xD;
      solicitation and non-solicitation AE) from 0 to 7 days, and all AE (non-solicitation AE) from&#xD;
      8 to 30 days;All serious adverse events (SAE) within 1 month after vaccination with the&#xD;
      experimental vaccine were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Solicitation AE (the following events occurring within 0-7 days after vaccination with&#xD;
           experimental vaccine) :Adverse events at the inoculation site (local) : pain, itching,&#xD;
           redness, swelling, rash, induration; Non-inoculated site (systemic) adverse events:&#xD;
           fever, headache, fatigue/fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, muscle pain&#xD;
           (non-inoculated site), acute allergic reaction, cough.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Vital signs and physical examination:All subjects were assessed for vital signs (blood&#xD;
           pressure, axillary body temperature, pulse) during screening and axillary body&#xD;
           temperature before trial vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All subjects underwent physical examination (skin, cardiopulmonary auscultation) during&#xD;
           the screening period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Collection of pregnancy events:Women of childbearing age should undergo a urine&#xD;
           pregnancy test before enrollment (on the day of vaccination).&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pregnancy events occurring within 1 month after trial vaccination were collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ADE/VED (Antibody enhancement/vaccine Enhancement) Risk Monitoring:After receiving the&#xD;
           experimental vaccine, if the subject is diagnosed with COVID-19, he/she should go to the&#xD;
           hospital for hospitalization or be isolated in accordance with the local epidemic&#xD;
           prevention and control requirements.A special investigation will be conducted for&#xD;
           severe/critical/fatal cases, and the existence of ADE/VED will be analyzed based on the&#xD;
           results of the special investigation.&#xD;
