  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It was reported that TSC2-deficient cells enhance phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the&#xD;
      Kennedy pathway. 11C-Choline can reflect the metabolic process of choline in vivo by&#xD;
      intravenous injection. The purpose of this study is the ability of 11C-Choline PET/CT to&#xD;
      evaluate the baseline condition of LAM patients and the efficacy of rapamycin after&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tuberous Sclerosis Complex (TSC) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by inactivating&#xD;
      mutations of the TSC1 or TSC2 gene, characterized by neurocognitive impairment and benign&#xD;
      tumors of the brain, skin, heart, and kidneys. Lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM) is a diffuse&#xD;
      proliferation of α-smooth muscle actin-positive cells associated with cystic destruction of&#xD;
      the lung. LAM occurs almost exclusively in women, as a TSC manifestation or a sporadic&#xD;
      disorder (TSC1/TSC2 somatic mutations). Biomarkers of whole-body tumor burden/activity and&#xD;
      response to rapalogs or other therapies remain needed in TSC/LAM. It was reported that&#xD;
      TSC2-deficient cells enhance phosphatidylcholine synthesis via the Kennedy pathway.&#xD;
      11C-Choline can reflect the metabolic process of choline in vivo by intravenous injection.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is the ability of 11C-Choline PET/CT to evaluate the baseline&#xD;
      condition of LAM patients and the efficacy of rapamycin after treatment.&#xD;
