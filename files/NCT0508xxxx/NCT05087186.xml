  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The psychological health of frontline healthcare workers, caring for critically ill patients&#xD;
      with COVID-19, has deteriorated during the pandemic. Nurses appear to be most seriously&#xD;
      affected. Despite the availability of supportive interventions, uptake is poor, and none have&#xD;
      been found beneficial in randomised controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have developed a two-pronged approach (combining the FLASH technique and&#xD;
      Guided Imagery) that aims to reduce existing symptoms of distress and provide participants&#xD;
      with techniques to help them cope with future stressful events. This approach has been&#xD;
      developed with experienced psychological practitioners, and staff members. The FLASH&#xD;
      technique is a recently developed therapy which aims to reduce psychological distress&#xD;
      following traumatic events. It allows participants to process traumatic memories without&#xD;
      feeling distress. Using guided imagery, a trained psychological practitioner helps&#xD;
      participants to direct attention from distressing or intrusive memories, by evoking or&#xD;
      generating positive mental images, sounds, tastes, smells and movement. Emerging evidence&#xD;
      suggests that both techniques are safe and effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROACTIVE will investigate the feasibility and acceptability of this two-pronged approach to&#xD;
      address existing traumatic symptoms and enhance future resilience for intensive care nurses.&#xD;
      Findings will inform the design of a larger trial which tests intervention effectiveness.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Nursing staff from critical care units within three Trusts will be approached, given&#xD;
      information regarding the study, and invited to participate. Nurses who wish to take part&#xD;
      will complete a consent form and a baseline range of psychological questionnaires. They will&#xD;
      then be asked to join our group sessions; two guided imagery training sessions to enhance&#xD;
      resilience; two therapy sessions, using the Flash Technique, to address symptoms of distress;&#xD;
      and a final follow-up session to consolidate techniques learnt. Sessions will be delivered&#xD;
      online, in four groups of ten staff. Recruitment will continue until the 40 intervention&#xD;
      slots have been filled. Six months after the first intervention session, participants will be&#xD;
      asked to repeat the range of psychological questionnaires, to help us understand whether the&#xD;
      intervention helped to reduce psychological distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will report recruitment and adherence rates and collect preliminary data&#xD;
      regarding the effectiveness of the intervention. The investigators will also undertake a&#xD;
      process evaluation, to examine acceptability and give participants a chance to report their&#xD;
      experience of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will inform the design of a subsequent multi-centre trial investigating the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention in improving the mental wellbeing of intensive care nurses.&#xD;

    <measure>Mental wellbeing</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scale - WEMWBS. Respondents rate items based on how often they have had the thought or feeling over the last two weeks, from 1 'not at all' to 5 'all of the time'. Total score is the sum of all items and ranges from 14-70. The lower the score, the higher the level of mental wellbeing.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Post-traumatic stress disorder</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>PTSD checklist - PCL-5. A 20 item self-report measure to assesses symptoms of PTSD over the last month. Items are rated on a 5-point scale ranging from 0 'not at all' to 4 'extremely'. Total score ranges from 0 to 80. A score of between 31-33 or above is indicative of probable PTSD.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Anxiety</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Generalised Anxiety Disorder-7 - GAD-7. Items are rated for how often they have bothered the respondent over the last two weeks, from 0 'not at all' to 3 'nearly every day'. Total score is the sum of all items and ranges from 0 to 15. Scores of 5, 10, and 15 are the cut-off points for mild, moderate and severe anxiety, respectively.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Depression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Patient Health Questionnaire-9 - PHQ-9. This 9-item self-report measure assesses symptoms of depression. Items are rated for how often they have bothered the respondent over the last two weeks, from 0 'not at all' to 3 'nearly every day'. Total score is the sum of both items and ranges from 0 to 27. Depression severity: 0-4 none, 5-9 mild, 10-14 moderate, 15-19 moderately severe, 20-27 severe.</description>

    <measure>Quality of life</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>EuroQol Five Dimension- Five level scale - EQ5D-5L. The 5-level version of the EuroQol-5D (EQ-5D-5L) is a brief measure for assessing general quality of life and health status. Items assess mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort and anxiety/depression each on a 5-point scale. 5 items are scored on a 5-point ordinal scale from 'no problem' (1) to 'highest level of problems' (5). Respondents also rate their overall health today from 0 (the worst health you can imagine) to 100 (the best health you can imagine). Scores are analysed separately (not summed).</description>

    <measure>Resilience</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Brief Resilience Scale - BRS. 6 items are scored on a 5-point ordinal scale from 'strongly disagree' to 'strongly agree', with reversing scores assigned to alternating questions. The scores for all 6 items are summed (giving a range from 6-30) and then divided by the total number of questions answered to give a final score.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Burnout syndrome</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 6 months post-intervention</time_frame>
    <description>Maslach Burnout Inventory - MBI. 22 statements of job-related feelings for which respondents are asked the frequency to which they feel this way about their job ranging from 0 'never' to 6 'every day'. Each statement relates to one of three dimensions of burnout; emotional exhaustion, depersonalization and personal accomplishment. Each dimension is scored by summing the answer for that section and dividing by the number of items answered. Possible scores range as follows; EE 0-54, D 0-30 and PA 0-40, with a higher score associated with a higher level of burnout.</description>
