  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rice is a staple food for over half the world's population. High consumption of white rice&#xD;
      has been linked with high obesity and increased risk for type 2 diabetes. However, it is&#xD;
      still the favoured type of rice among consumers, contributing to the observed increasing&#xD;
      trends in diet-related diseases in countries with high rice consumption. Controlling the&#xD;
      properties of white rice products (e.g. reducing the glycaemic index and/or increasing&#xD;
      satiety) with relatively simple interventions could contribute to producing foods with&#xD;
      health-promoting digestibility profiles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One way to reduce the glycaemic index of white rice is through processing. Addition of food&#xD;
      thickeners (called hydrocolloid gums) has previously been shown to reduce the digestibility&#xD;
      of foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This work will test the hypothesis that gellan gum is a simple way to manipulate the body's&#xD;
      glucose response to a white rice which in turn will have health-promoting effects. MRI&#xD;
      imaging will be used to monitor the gastrointestinal responses.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Addition of hydrocolloids has previously been shown to reduce the digestibility of foods.&#xD;
      Hydrocolloids are polysaccharides used to increase viscosity and gelatinization and have many&#xD;
      other applications in the food industry. However, there is a lack of mechanistic&#xD;
      understanding on how these hydrocolloids may act during digestion in the human body.&#xD;
      Preliminary in-house data suggested that the addition of gellan gum to rice cooking may&#xD;
      reduce digestibility rates though mechanisms yet to be understood. This work will test the&#xD;
      hypothesis that gellan gum can be used to manipulate white rice product properties to enhance&#xD;
      health-promoting glycaemic, gastrointestinal and satiety responses in healthy human&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1. to collect pilot data on postprandial glucose levels of isoenergetic test meal made from&#xD;
      rice and Gellan Gum 2 . to collect data on their gastric emptying and satiety. 3. to compare&#xD;
      postprandial glucose levels, gastric emptying and satiety for the treatments 4. to explore&#xD;
      relationships between glucose levels, gastric emptying and satiety.&#xD;
