      A community-based Phase III, cluster randomized trial that seeks to determine the 24 week&#xD;
      survival with retention in care of point of care CD4 testing with visitect and an enhanced&#xD;
      package of screening and prophylaxis for opportunistic infections among patients with&#xD;
      advanced HIV disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study will be carried out in a population of HIV-infected adults with advanced HIV&#xD;
      disease (CD4 &lt;200 cells/µL) in Uganda. It will be a Randomized controlled trial, Phase III in&#xD;
      Uganda over a duration of 5 years assessing 24 weeks survival with retention in care. @4&#xD;
      clinic will be randomized to either receive the enhanced package or standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Intervention Arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Point-of-care CD4 testing via Visitect (point of care semi Quantitaive CD4 LFA) lateral&#xD;
           flow assay (LFA)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Enhanced package of opportunistic infection screening and prophylaxis for CD4&lt;200,&#xD;
           including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  FujiFilm SILVAMP TB LAM (FujiLAM)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Isoniazid (INH) + rifapentine: 1 month of therapy for latent TB(Tuberculosis)&#xD;
                infection&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Cryptococcal Antigen semi-quantitative (CrAg-SQ) LFA (Immy)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Treatment for disseminated CNS cryptococcal infection if high blood CrAg titer (&gt;3+&#xD;
                CrAg SQ)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of Standard of Care Arm&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CD4 testing by flow cytometry&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. WHO recommended package of OI screening and prophylaxis, including:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Urine TB LAM&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  INH ( isoniazid 6 months)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  CrAg LFA&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Fluconazole for asymptomatic CrAg+ o 800mg daily x 2 weeks, then 400mg daily x 8&#xD;
                weeks, then 200mg daily.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Problem statement: Current lab-based CD4 testing results in a delay to either start&#xD;
      ART(Antiretroviral therapy) or a delay in screening persons with low CD4s for OIs. At&#xD;
      present, prioritization has been on ART initiation without systematic OI screening. Those&#xD;
      with subclinical OIs started on ART unmask their OIs, with hospitalization / deaths for OIs&#xD;
      such as cryptococcosis and TB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that with point of care CD4 testing, same-day OI screening can occur, yet not&#xD;
      interrupt prompt ART initiation for those at low risk (FujiLAM and CrAg-SQ negative) of&#xD;
      unmasking immune reconstitution syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that point-of-care CD4 testing will improve 6-month survival by reducing lag&#xD;
      time in CD4 results, thereby facilitating ART initiation, retention-in-care, and OI screening&#xD;
      and prophylaxis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that enhanced screening with the point-of-care FujiLAM, CrAg-SQ LFA, with&#xD;
      enhanced prophylaxis for TB (1 month of INH and rifapentine) and with treatment for&#xD;
      disseminated CNS cryptococcal infection in those CrAg+ with high titers (&gt;3+) will improve&#xD;
      6-month survival compared to current WHO-recommended standard practice in persons with&#xD;
      advanced HIV disease.&#xD;
