      The purpose of this clinical trial is to investigate the causal role that delta-beta coupling&#xD;
      plays in goal-directed behavior in participants with major depressive disorder (MDD) and&#xD;
      symptoms of anhedonia. The participants will perform a reward-based decision-making task.&#xD;
      During the task, cross-frequency transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) will be&#xD;
      delivered at delta-beta frequency, a control-frequency, or an active sham.&#xD;
      Electroencephalography will be collected in intermittent resting-state periods. Structural&#xD;
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) will be collected during the resting-state&#xD;
      and during performance of the task.&#xD;

    <intervention_model>Parallel Assignment</intervention_model>
    <intervention_model_description>Participants are randomized into one of three arms of the study: delta-beta tACS, control tACS in theta-gamma, or active sham. Randomization is stratified by SHAPS level such that there are an equal number of participants that are high anhedonia (SHAPS &gt; 33) and low anhedonia (SHAPS &lt;=33).</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Basic Science</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Double (Participant, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This study is designed to be double-blind. Participants and the researchers are unaware of each participant's assignment until the completion of all data collection. This is accomplished using randomization codes. Furthermore, this study utilizes an active sham stimulation. This means that the active sham condition includes some stimulation, mimicking the skin sensations associated with tACS. In a previously concluded trial, participants in the delta-beta tACS, theta-gamma tACS, and active sham groups responded similarly to the blinding questionnaire, indicating that the active sham stimulation successfully blinded the participants.</masking_description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of trials that the participant chooses to perform the hard task</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Goal-directed behavior will be calculated as the percentage of trials in which the participant decides to perform the most difficult effort exertion task in the Expenditure of Effort for Reward Task. The average for the four blocks prior to stimulation serve as a baseline and the eight blocks during stimulation will be calculated and the difference from baseline will be investigated.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Coupling strength between low-frequency prefrontal signals and high-frequency posterior signals</measure>
    <time_frame>3 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Phase-amplitude coupling strength is calculated between the phase of low-frequency activity in prefrontal electrodes and amplitude of high-frequency in posterior cortex. These signals are extracted from eyes-open resting-state periods after stimulation is turned off following each task block. Instantaneous phase and amplitude will be calculated by averaging electrodes in the regions, band-filtering to the specified range, and performing the Hilbert transform. Next, a hybrid signal is created using the high-frequency amplitude and low-frequency phase. Coupling strength is the magnitude of the average of this signal over time. Finally, coupling strength is normalized using a z-transformation with respect to a null distribution generated by randomly time-shifting the high-frequency time-series.</description>

    <arm_group_type>Experimental</arm_group_type>
    <description>The study is investigating the use of transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS). The stimulation is delivered at 1 milliampere (mA) zero-to-peak amplitude at the target electrodes and 2 mA zero to-peak amplitude at the return electrode. For the experimental arm, the tACS will be delivered using the cross-frequency stimulation waveform delta-beta (3-20Hz).</description>

    <arm_group_label>Theta-gamma tACS</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Active Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>This arm serves as an active control where tACS will be delivered using the cross-frequency stimulation waveform theta-gamma (5-50Hz).</description>

    <arm_group_label>Active-sham tACS</arm_group_label>
    <arm_group_type>Sham Comparator</arm_group_type>
    <description>For active sham stimulation, either delta-beta or theta-gamma stimulation is delivered for 10 seconds and then returns to baseline. This is intended to mimic the skin sensations (e.g., itching, burning, tingling) that are experienced at the onset of stimulation, assisting with blinding the participant's assignment.</description>
