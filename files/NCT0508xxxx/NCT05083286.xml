  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a blinded, randomized study in the US to compare the duration response of two&#xD;
      different concentrations of BOTOX in healthy female subjects with moderate to severe dynamic&#xD;
      glabellar lines on maximum frown.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study involves a blinded, randomized, parallel-group design. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the duration response of BOTOX in subjects with moderate to severe dynamic glabellar&#xD;
      lines at the approved on-label dose of 20 U, however comparing the use of highly Concentrated&#xD;
      On Label Dose (COLD) to the On Label Dose and concentration (OLD). The COLD concentration is&#xD;
      defined as 4 Units per 0.02 mL and the OLD concentration is defined as 4 Units per 0.1 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total BOTOX dose will be 20U divided into 5 injections for both study groups. However,&#xD;
      the injection volume will differ for the two study groups, such that the OLD (4 U per 0.1 mL)&#xD;
      group will receive a total of 0.5 mL and the COLD (4 U per 0.02 mL) group will receive a&#xD;
      total of 0.1mL.&#xD;
