  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to identify effective treatments for SARS-CoV-2 infection that helps&#xD;
      people recover quicker and reduces the need for hospital admission. The investigators develop&#xD;
      an open, adaptive, platform trial to evaluate treatments, Fluvoxamine, Bromhexine,&#xD;
      Cyproheptadine, and Niclosamide suitable for use in the community for treating&#xD;
      COVID-like-illness that might help people recover sooner and prevent hospitalisation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is an urgent need to identify interventions against COVID-19 suitable for wide use in&#xD;
      the community that have been proven to be effective in reducing symptom duration or&#xD;
      hospitalisation. There is urgent need to know whether potential COVID-19 treatments such as&#xD;
      Fluvoxamine, Bromhexine, Cyproheptadine, and Niclosamide that are available for rapid&#xD;
      pragmatic evaluation might modify the course of COVID-19 infections, particularly among those&#xD;
      who are at higher risk of complications, such as those aged 50 years and over with&#xD;
      comorbidity and those aged 65 years and over.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most reported trials have been conducted in hospital settings, and there is little evidence&#xD;
      from community settings, where most people with COVID-19 receive care and where deployment of&#xD;
      effective early treatment could speed time to recovery and reduce complications. The&#xD;
      investigators established a multi-arm, adaptive platform, randomised controlled trial for&#xD;
      community treatment of COVID-19 syndromic illness in people at higher risk of an adverse&#xD;
      illness course.&#xD;

All enrolled patients will be provided a thermometer as well as a fingertip probe pulse oximeter, with the specific instructions to monitor both temperature at oxygen saturation at the time of daily oral administration of drug. In addition, Oropharyngeal swab samples will be collected for viral shedding as measured by PCR on days 0, 7 and 14. Fecal and blood samples will be collected for viral shedding as measured by PCR on days 0,7 and 14. A baseline fecal and oropharyngeal sample will be obtained on Day 0 prior to starting dosing of drugs.</description>
