      The ASCEND post-market clinical follow-up study is undertaken to evaluate safety and clinical&#xD;
      performance of the On-X Ascending Aortic Prosthesis (AAP) used in surgical aortic valve&#xD;
      replacement.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study patients will be observed that receive an On-X AAP implant for the treatment of&#xD;
      a diseased, damaged, or malfunctioning native or prosthetic heart valve. The On-X AAP will be&#xD;
      implanted at the discretion of the treating physician. Participating physicians will be asked&#xD;
      to provide their observations collected during routine care for patients he/she had decided&#xD;
      to treat with the On-X AAP. Written informed consent of the patients for the use of their&#xD;
      clinical records for study purposes will be obtained before their data will be collected in&#xD;
      the PMCF study. In Europe, every patient will be enrolled prospectively prior to the&#xD;
      intervention. In the US, patients can be enrolled retrospectively after the intervention or&#xD;
      prospectively prior to the intervention. The data from patients who have died following their&#xD;
      implant will be recorded in the database without the requirement for written informed consent&#xD;
      after IRB approval.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The period of data collection will be approximately 120 + 6 months (depending on the date of&#xD;
      the last follow-up visit) from the surgery for each patient.&#xD;
