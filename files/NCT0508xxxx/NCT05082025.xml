      Part 1: Dose confirmation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To evaluate the safety, tolerability, and dose-limiting toxicities (DLT) of copanlisib 60&#xD;
      mg administered intravenously (IV) on Days 1, 8 and 15 in combination with fulvestrant 500 mg&#xD;
      administered intramuscularly (IM) on Day 1 and Day 15 of Cycle 1, and then on Day 1 of each&#xD;
      subsequent 28-day cycle to confirm the recommended phase 2 doses (RP2D) of the combination&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the efficacy of copanlisib administered in combination with fulvestrant as&#xD;
           outlined in Part 2 by evaluating the objective response rate (ORR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate additional efficacy measures such as progression-free survival (PFS) and&#xD;
           overall survival (OS) of copanlisib in combination with fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate target engagement, clonal evolution, and mechanisms of resistance using&#xD;
           tissue and liquid biopsies utilizing circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) as outlined in Part&#xD;
           2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the pharmacokinetics (PK) of copanlisib and fulvestrant when given in&#xD;
           combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: Dose expansion:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To assess the efficacy of copanlisib administered in combination with fulvestrant as&#xD;
      outlined above by evaluating the objective response rate (ORR). Patients enrolled for Part 1&#xD;
      will be included in this efficacy analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate additional efficacy measures such as PFS and OS of copanlisib in combination&#xD;
           with fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the safety and tolerability of copanlisib in combination with fulvestrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate target engagement, clonal evolution, and mechanisms of resistance using&#xD;
           tissue and liquid biopsies utilizing ctDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the PK of copanlisib and fulvestrant when given in combination.&#xD;
