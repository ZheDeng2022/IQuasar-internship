  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the static SPF of three sunscreen products&#xD;
      (ChapStick Lip Moisturizer [CLM] Original, CLM Mint Flavour and CLM Black Cherry Flavour)&#xD;
      using the methodology described in the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Final Rule (2011).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A single-center, randomized, controlled, intra-individual comparison, evaluator-blind,&#xD;
      clinical study to determine the SPF of three sunscreen lip balms. Each participant will&#xD;
      evaluate the three test products, an SPF standard and no treatment. Study treatments will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to 5 test sites delineated on the skin of the participant's back. Test&#xD;
      sites will be exposed to doses of ultraviolet (UV) radiation and erytemal response evaluated&#xD;
      16-24 hours later. Minimal erythema dose (MED) will be determined for protected and&#xD;
      unprotected sites and used to determine the SPF value of each test product.&#xD;

    <measure>Arithmetic Mean of Individual Sun Protection Factor (SPFi) Values</measure>
    <time_frame>Up to 24 hours post UV exposure</time_frame>
    <description>Arithmetic mean of all valid SPFi values of each product on each participant will be calculated from the individual Minimal Erythemal Dose (MED) on product treated (MEDp) test sites in relation to unprotected (MEDu) test sites 16-24 hours after exposure to UV radiation. SPFi = MEDp/MEDu. The MED is defined as the lowest dose of UV radiation that produces the first perceptible unambiguous erythema with defined borders appearing over most of the field of UV exposure. The exposure shall be increased in geometric progression with 25% dose increment in relation to the expected SPF values. All individual SPF values will be converted arithmetically to calculate SPF of test material (or control standard).</description>
