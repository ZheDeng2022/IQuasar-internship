  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In society today, mental health problems, specifically stress-, anxiety- and depressive&#xD;
      disorders, are a primary cause of long-term sick leave, leading to significant societal costs&#xD;
      and suffering. One important issue hindering implementation of successful treatments is that&#xD;
      there is a marked co-occurrence between these problems and somatic health problems, such as&#xD;
      different types of pain. An important key to solving this problem is to develop a more&#xD;
      integrated conceptualization of, and treatment model for, these patients' health problems.&#xD;
      Specifically, one way to understand the co-occurrence between mental and somatic health&#xD;
      problems is offered by the 'transdiagnostic' perspective. The aim of this project is to&#xD;
      implement and evaluate the effectiveness of a transdiagnostic emotion-focused treatment&#xD;
      protocol in clinical context. The treatment addresses comorbid mental (stress, anxiety- and&#xD;
      depressive) and somatic health (pain) problems and targets core emotion regulation processes&#xD;
      that are hypothesized to maintain and exacerbate these problems.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This study employs a sequential single-case experimental AB design with randomized waiting period lengths (4, 5 or 6 weeks). Included in the design is also standardized pre-post and follow up measurement allowing for single group analysis of change. In addition, we collect qualitative data from patients, practitioners and clinical managers, detailing how the treatment and its implementation are experienced.</intervention_model_description>
