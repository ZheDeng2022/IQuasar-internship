  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      SARS-CoV-2 is a highly transmissible and pathogenic coronavirus that emerged in late 2019 and&#xD;
      has caused a pandemic of acute respiratory disease, collectively called coronavirus&#xD;
      disease-19 (COVID-19). SARS-CoV-2 has a high transmission rate, and severe cases of COVID-19&#xD;
      require admission to hospital intensive care units with the need for mechanical ventilation&#xD;
      and associated high mortality. Currently cases continue to rise in many countries as the&#xD;
      'second and third waves' of SARS-CoV-2 infection evolve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authorized vaccines and most vaccines in development are focused on the major antigenic&#xD;
      target of the virus, the SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) protein. Authorization was granted in Brazil by&#xD;
      ANVISA for the Fiocruz/Oxford-AstraZeneca ChAdOx1-S COVID-19 vaccine as a 2-dose homologous&#xD;
      vaccination regimen, 28- to 84-days apart. Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) was also granted&#xD;
      for Sinovac Biotech's CoronaVac vaccine as a 2-dose homologous vaccination regimen, 28 days&#xD;
      apart. Further vaccines, using different platforms are approved or expected to be approved&#xD;
      for use against SARS-CoV-2. Most of the vaccines are expected to be authorized as 2-dose,&#xD;
      homologous vaccination series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCB-2019 is Clover's adjuvanted recombinant SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S-protein subunit vaccine.&#xD;
      The SCB-2019 antigen includes SARS-CoV-2 S protein as a trimer fused to Trimer-Tag and is&#xD;
      produced in Chinese hamster ovary cells (CHO). SCB-2019 preserves the native trimeric&#xD;
      structure of S-protein in the prefusion form and induces neutralizing antibodies to&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2. Trimer-Tag is derived from the fully-human C-propeptide domain of pro-collagen&#xD;
      and is capable of self-trimerization, thus fusing any biologically-active proteins in-frame&#xD;
      with Trimer-Tag. The resulting fusion proteins expressed in mammalian cells are secreted as&#xD;
      disulfide bond-linked homotrimers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The immunogenicity and safety of different dose levels (3, 9, and 30 μg) SCB-2019 vaccine,&#xD;
      administered as 2-dose regimen 21-days apart was assessed in a phase 1 clinical study. All&#xD;
      dose levels were well-tolerated and induced neutralizing antibodies against S protein of the&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus. Based on the results of that study, Clover selected 30 μg of SCB-2019 in&#xD;
      combination with the CpG 1018/alum adjuvant system for further evaluation in the phase 2/3&#xD;
      clinical program as having the most favorable benefit/risk profile. The pivotal study&#xD;
      (CLO-SCB-2019-003) included approximately 30,000 healthy participants and individuals with&#xD;
      stable pre-existing chronic medical conditions, is being conducted in multiple countries,&#xD;
      including in Brazil. The primary purpose of that study (CLO-SCB-2019-003) is to demonstrate&#xD;
      the safety and efficacy of SCB-2019 in the prevention of COVID-19. The study showed efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heterologous boost vaccinations using different platforms may elicit immune responses of&#xD;
      greater magnitude and breadth than can be achieved by priming or boosting with the same&#xD;
      vaccine (He et al, 2021, Spencer et al., 2021). Also, given the anticipated challenges of&#xD;
      vaccinating large proportions of the population, especially with respect to supply,&#xD;
      out-of-stock situations, and potential misadministration, it is important for policy makers&#xD;
      to have data on flexible vaccination schedules, where the third dose might be different from&#xD;
      the priming platform. Protein-based adjuvanted vaccines have the advantage of being from a&#xD;
      known and licensed technology that can produce high quantities of vaccine. Protein-based&#xD;
      adjuvanted vaccines have also been shown to be highly immunogenic, both in the context of&#xD;
      COVID-19 (Keech 2020; Richmond 2021) and other licensed vaccines (Skwarczynski 2016).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to compare the immunogenicity and safety of heterologous and&#xD;
      homologous booster schedules in individuals who received ChAdOx1-S or CoronaVac vaccination&#xD;
      previously. The study will be performed in 2 stages - Stage 1 will serve to down-select one&#xD;
      of the SCB-2019 formulations for boosting. Stage 2 will compare homologous and heterologous&#xD;
      booster regimens in individuals who have received a 2-dose primary vaccination series of&#xD;
      either ChadOx1-S or of CoronaVac.&#xD;

      This is a phase 2, randomized, controlled, observer-blinded, multi-center study to evaluate&#xD;
      the immunogenicity and safety of heterologous and homologous vaccination series with&#xD;
      ChAdOx1-S or CoronaVac COVID-19 vaccines and various formulations of adjuvanted recombinant&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 trimeric S-protein subunit vaccine (SCB-2019). The study will be conducted in two&#xD;

    <masking_description>This study will be observer-blind for Stage 1 and Stage 2. The participants will be blinded before receiving the study vaccination. An unblinded dosing team, not involved with study participant's evaluation, will prepare and administer the study vaccines.&#xD;
The investigational product syringe will be opacified. The administration of the study vaccine will also be performed behind a closed curtain. The investigative study center personnel, as well as the sponsor personnel involved in the monitoring or conduct of the study, will be blinded to the study vaccine code.&#xD;
The laboratories will also be blinded, so that associating the sample with an assigned treatment or study visit will not be possible.</masking_description>
