  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is very common following a spinal cord injury, estimated to affect 43% of&#xD;
      patients after 6 months. A proportion of these patients do not respond to treatment and there&#xD;
      remains an unmet need to treat people with refractory spinal injury related neuropathic pain.&#xD;
      While neuropathic pain medications, baclofen pumps and spinal cord stimulation work for some&#xD;
      patients, a significant number are refractory to these therapies. Chronic pain can contribute&#xD;
      to loss of functional ability, mental health problems, and a worse quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies of functional neuroimaging have shown that the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) is a&#xD;
      key structure in human pain perception, being part of a central pain neuromatrix or medial&#xD;
      pain system, which includes thalamic nuclei and periaqueductal grey matter. A similar&#xD;
      neuromatrix also including the insula is involved in the regulation of the autonomic nervous&#xD;
      system, which explains the well-recognized interactions between pain and autonomic function.&#xD;
      Moreover, it has been shown that the ACC is important for the emotional experience and thus&#xD;
      the subjective intensity of pain, and it has a role in cognitive control processes for&#xD;
      optimizing behaviour in the presence of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bilateral anterior cingulotomy has been demonstrated to be a safe and effective therapeutic&#xD;
      option for patients with otherwise intractable pain syndromes of different origins, e.g.,&#xD;
      refractory pain due to cancer or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although, cingulotomy has been shown to be a viable option in intractable pain of different&#xD;
      origins, there remains a lack of evidence in patients with spinal cord injury and only scanty&#xD;
      data are available in literature. Moreover, the effects of cingulotomy on mood, emotion&#xD;
      processing, cognition and autonomic reactivity are not clear.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neuropathic pain is very common following spinal cord injury, with significant long-term&#xD;
      impact on an individual's quality of life, functional ability and mental health, as well as&#xD;
      increased utilisation of health care resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      People living with the effects of spinal cord injury frequently suffer chronic neuropathic&#xD;
      pain. A proportion of these do not respond to treatment and there remains an unmet need to&#xD;
      treat people with refractory spinal injury related neuropathic pain. While spasms can be&#xD;
      treated by baclofen pumps and neuropathic pain sometimes treated by spinal cord stimulation,&#xD;
      many patients remain refractory to those surgical treatments. The research aims to establish&#xD;
      the efficacy of bilateral anterior cingulotomy to treat chronic pain in people with spinal&#xD;
      cord injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic bilateral anterior cingulotomy is a brain operation with demonstrated efficacy&#xD;
      in the treatment of intractable pain from a variety of causes, including a few cases of&#xD;
      spinal cord injury related neuropathic pain. This may therefore be a therapeutic option for&#xD;
      patients refractory to other treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significant recent advances in surgical and imaging techniques have vastly improved the&#xD;
      outcomes and safety profile of stereotactic lesioning for multiple indications, most commonly&#xD;
      movement disorders but also other conditions including pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, only scanty epidemiological data on the effect of this procedure in people with&#xD;
      chronic pain are available in the scientific literature so far and it is unclear the number&#xD;
      of patients who may benefit from such a treatment. Few case reports have been published&#xD;
      reporting a good outcome of bilateral cingulotomy on pain in patients with SCI [8].&#xD;
      Therefore, there is a hope that this procedure may offer significant relief and thus improved&#xD;
      quality of life for a proportion of patients with SCI who have exhausted other treatment&#xD;
      options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this open label study will provide important information on whether bilateral&#xD;
      anterior cingulotomy is an effective treatment in improving pain refractory to other&#xD;
      routinely offered treatments in patients with spinal cord injury. This will give scientific&#xD;
      evidence for offering this procedure to these patients and alleviate their symptoms and&#xD;
      improve their quality of life. If efficacy is established, it may become an established&#xD;
      viable option in routine clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit 12 patients over a period of 24 months with 12 months'&#xD;
      follow-up and to analyse and publish their results in the following 12 months. The&#xD;
      investigators will ensure that findings will promptly reach the widest audience of potential&#xD;
      beneficiaries (academic, clinical, patients and public audiences) to have a practical impact&#xD;
      on clinical management of patients with SCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to demonstrate whether this procedure can provide sustained symptomatic&#xD;
      relief while carefully monitoring for the development of adverse effects. They propose a&#xD;
      pilot open label study of 12 patients with refractory neuropathic pain associated with spinal&#xD;
      cord injury to determine the safety and efficacy of this procedure in this group of patients.&#xD;
      The anterior cingulate cortex is involved not only in the regulation of pain but also in&#xD;
      emotional and autonomic nervous system regulation, which the investigators will monitor&#xD;
      closely to determine the nature of any effects that this procedure might cause.&#xD;
