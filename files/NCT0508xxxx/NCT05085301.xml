      Since their introduction in the late 90's, rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) have markedly&#xD;
      improved our ability to control malaria; yet they have inherent limitations which include low&#xD;
      sensitivity in Plasmodium vivax detection and inability to detect hrp2/3 gene deleted&#xD;
      Plasmodium falciparum parasites. In addition, the spread of P. falciparum parasites lacking&#xD;
      hrp2 gene jeopardizes the long-term use of P. falciparum-specific HRP2-based RDTs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A partnership between RapiGEN, FIND, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) is&#xD;
      addressing these limitations by developing five novel malaria RDTs with improved pLDH and&#xD;
      HRP2 detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RapiGEN has also developed three novel malaria RDTs - BIOCREDIT Malaria Ag Pf/Pv (pLDH/pLDH),&#xD;
      BIOCREDIT Malaria Ag Pf (pLDH/HRP2) and BIOCREDIT Malaria Ag Pf (pLDH) - to address these&#xD;
      drawbacks. The BIOCREDIT Malaria Ag Pf/Pv (pLDH/pLDH) is a combo test that detects P.&#xD;
      falciparum and P. vivax on a single device. BIOCREDIT Malaria Ag Pf (pLDH/HRP2) targets both&#xD;
      PfLDH and HRP2 antigens in P. falciparum; and BIOCREDIT Malaria Ag Pf (pLDH) has improved&#xD;
      detection of pLDH in P. falciparum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In countries with circulation of hrp2/3 deleted P. falciparum malaria parasites or high P.&#xD;
      vivax burden, these improved RDTs may be invaluable in malaria elimination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a prospective and retrospective evaluation of RapiGEN's BIOCREDIT Malaria Ag&#xD;
      RDTs in malaria-endemic countries to assess their clinical performance for detection of&#xD;
      malaria. The purpose of this study is to provide a high level outline of the study design and&#xD;
      conduct to support the collation of a data package for WHO Pre-Qualification proposed study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Malaria continues to create a major health burden in the tropics especially in Africa.&#xD;
      Introduction of Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) has dramatically improved the&#xD;
      outcomes of morbidity and mortality of malaria cases. Introduction of RDTs as well&#xD;
      dramatically influenced cases detection hence treatment. The situation in Sudan is not&#xD;
      different from the general picture in all Africa and witness great reduction of deaths from&#xD;
      malaria since the introduction of ACT in 2005 (1). The national protocol depends now on&#xD;
      Giemsa stained slides microcopy or certified RDTs for diagnosis and ACT as first and second&#xD;
      line of treatment (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recommendation by World Health Organization (WHO) on parasitological confirmation of malaria&#xD;
      cases by microscopy or rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) before treatment increased the use and&#xD;
      availability of RDTs worldwide (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapid diagnostic tests, since their introduction in the late 90's, have dramatically improved&#xD;
      our ability to control malaria. Most RDTs are based on histidine-rich protein 2 (PfHRP2) or&#xD;
      lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), which are present in Plasmodium falciparum only and all&#xD;
      human-infecting Plasmodium species respectively (4). However, the gradual spread of&#xD;
      hrp2/hrp3-deleted mutants in several endemic countries in South America, Asia and Africa&#xD;
      exerts a substantial potential impact on the utility of HRP2-based RDTs for case management&#xD;
      in these settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasmodium lactate dehydrogenase (pLDH), on the other hand, appears as a good alternative to&#xD;
      HRP2 as it is an essential protein expressed by all human-infecting Plasmodium species;&#xD;
      however, pLDH-based RDTs were shown to perform poorly at low parasitaemia, which is common&#xD;
      among patients infected with P. vivax, P. malariae and P. ovale species as well as in&#xD;
      asymptomatic infections. Therefore, it is less preferred in endemic-countries. In these&#xD;
      settings, malaria microscopy holds its reign as the standard of reference thanks to its low&#xD;
      direct cost and ability to detect, quantify, and differentiate malaria parasites. However, it&#xD;
      is also labour-intensive, time-consuming and expertise-demanding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim of addressing these limitations, RapiGEN has developed novel malaria RDTs, in&#xD;
      partnership with FIND and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF). RapiGEN developed&#xD;
      BIOCREDIT Malaria Ag Pf/Pv (pLDH/pLDH), BIOCREDIT Malaria Ag Pf (pLDH/HRP2) and BIOCREDIT&#xD;
      Malaria Ag Pf.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These may provide added value compared to currently available malaria RDTs, especially in&#xD;
      settings where current tests prove to be insufficient due to hrp2 deletion or high burden of&#xD;
      P. vivax malaria.&#xD;
