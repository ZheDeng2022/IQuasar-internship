      Probiotics may be considered as an option of treatment for long COVID since they have&#xD;
      anti-viral effect, trigger immunomodulation and have low side-effects. This randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial aims to reduce the number of patients with long COVID by 25% 90 days after&#xD;
      the COVID-19 diagnosis by taking probiotics in a symptomatic population, self-caring at home.&#xD;
      During the acute phase of the disease, participants will take two capsules (probiotics or&#xD;
      placebo) per day for 10 days and one capsule (probiotics or placebo) per day for the&#xD;
      following 15 days. A follow-up will be done twice during the acute phase, 14 days and 28 days&#xD;
      after starting to take the investigational product (compliance to treatment, side effects,&#xD;
      etc.). At inclusion and at Day14, Day30 and Day90 after the COVID-19 diagnosis, a&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered (COVID-19 symptoms, anxiety, functioning difficulties,&#xD;
      etc.) and 2 saliva and 2 stool (viral and microbiota analyzes) self-samples will be&#xD;
      performed.&#xD;

      Rational:&#xD;
&#xD;
      COVID-19 disease caused by a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) has received worldwide attention.&#xD;
      No effective treatment against COVID-19 is available and the current vaccination appears&#xD;
      essential to control the pandemic. However, many questions remain, such as the durability of&#xD;
      immunity and the appearance of variants. While the acute phase has been widely studied, the&#xD;
      long-term consequences are unknown, and a new burden is emerging: the long COVID. The long&#xD;
      COVID is defined by the persistence of symptoms of the disease for more than 4 weeks after&#xD;
      diagnosis. Several strong arguments support the study of probiotics for COVID-19: 1)&#xD;
      probiotics act on viruses by various well described mechanisms (reduction of absorption,&#xD;
      cellular internalization of the virus, production of metabolites/substances having a direct&#xD;
      antiviral effect and immunomodulation); 2) probiotics are considered with a high level of&#xD;
      evidence (meta-analysis) to reduce diarrhea (associated with antibiotics and Clostridium&#xD;
      difficile) and for respiratory tract infections and 3) probiotics are affordable and&#xD;
      available with low side-effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: Reduce the number of patients with long COVID by 25% 90 days after the&#xD;
      COVID-19 diagnosis by taking probiotics during the acute phase of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives (SO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      SO1: Reduce the number of patients with long COVID by 25% 30 days after the COVID-19&#xD;
      diagnosis by taking probiotics during the acute phase of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SO2: Improve the understanding of the mechanism of action of probiotics on long COVID from&#xD;
      salivary and fecal virological and microbiota analyzes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SO3: Identify the prognostic factors measured at the baseline (inclusion) associated with&#xD;
      long COVID (socio-demographic, clinical, virological, microbiological factors) and the&#xD;
      time-dependent factors after the baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      618 men and women, 18 years or older, with a first positive test for COVID-19 in the last 10&#xD;
      days, having symptoms of the COVID-19, self-caring at home, living in Quebec for the next 90&#xD;
      days, able to take medication alone, with access to a phone or to the Internet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be randomized in one of the study groups (stratified by age and gender). The&#xD;
      randomization is double-blinded and uses a ratio 1:1. Group A: will take probiotics for 25&#xD;
      days / Group B: will take placebo for 25 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the acute phase of the disease, participants will take two capsules (probiotics or&#xD;
      placebo) per day (one closed capsule to swallow and one open capsule mixed with maple syrup)&#xD;
      for 10 days and one closed capsule (probiotics or placebo) per day to swallow for the&#xD;
      following 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A follow-up will be done twice during the acute phase, 14 days and 28 days after starting to&#xD;
      take the investigational product to evaluate compliance to treatment, medication intake, side&#xD;
      effects, etc. At inclusion and at Day14, Day30 and Day90 after the COVID-19 diagnosis, the&#xD;
      participant will complete a questionnaire that will focus on COVID-19 symptoms, food intake,&#xD;
      anxiety, functioning difficulties, quality of life, etc. For those who will be admitted to&#xD;
      hospital, data on their admission, complications and treatments will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Samples:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At inclusion and at Day14, Day30 and Day90 after the COVID-19 diagnosis, 2 saliva and 2 stool&#xD;
      (viral and microbiota analyzes) self-samples will be performed.&#xD;
