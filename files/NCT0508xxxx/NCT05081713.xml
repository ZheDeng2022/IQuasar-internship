      The proposed research will characterize of the time course of neurological and locomotor&#xD;
      recovery as well as development of compensatory strategies throughout sub-acute and chronic&#xD;
      phases post stroke. In addition, we will also investigate the extent to which measures of&#xD;
      recovery and compensation are malleable and can be altered with specific interventions in&#xD;
      both the early and late stages post-stroke. Delineation of the time course of development and&#xD;
      magnitude of patterns of recovery and compensation should result in alternative predictive&#xD;
      &quot;rules' regarding how patients early post-stroke could recovery functional and neurological&#xD;
      function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recovery of locomotion is a primary goal of rehabilitation post-stroke and a major&#xD;
      determinant of future morbidity and mortality. While substantial recovery is observed early&#xD;
      post-stroke, recent evidence suggests the magnitude and time course of recovery is&#xD;
      deterministic and based primarily on initial motor deficits. The &quot;proportional recovery&quot; rule&#xD;
      suggests ~70% of neurological recovery (measured by the lower limb Fugl-Meyer Assessment -&#xD;
      LL-FMA) is typically achieved and is not influenced by the dosage of therapy. These findings&#xD;
      suggest the physical interventions applied to patients are of minimal importance to long-term&#xD;
      recovery. That hypothesis conflicts directly with our recent efforts suggesting that&#xD;
      maximizing the amount and intensity of task-specific (stepping) practice (high-intensity&#xD;
      training; HIT) directly influences gains in locomotor function. Providing HIT at heart rates&#xD;
      (HRs) greater than traditional aerobic paradigms (mean 110% baseline HRmax) is associated&#xD;
      with gains in locomotor speed, which challenges the notion of &quot;proportional recovery&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These conflicting hypotheses likely arise from differences in terminology and methodology&#xD;
      used to characterize recovery post-stroke. First, the traditional measure of neurological&#xD;
      recovery (LL-FMA) does not adequately characterize other impairments (strength, postural&#xD;
      stability) that are more closely associated to locomotor function and are responsive to&#xD;
      physical interventions. Second, despite gains in selected impairments, patients often utilize&#xD;
      alternative (compensatory) movement patterns to accomplish locomotor tasks. More directly,&#xD;
      locomotor recovery (i.e., speed/distance) is often accomplished using strategies employed&#xD;
      prior to stroke and compensatory strategies, particularly in those with substantial&#xD;
      impairments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our central hypothesis is that if changes in neurological recovery are deterministic, other&#xD;
      measures of locomotor recovery or compensations may also be predictable. Our published data&#xD;
      detail how HIT or conventional interventions can alter impairments and locomotor recovery, as&#xD;
      well as changes in locomotor compensations. More directly, our data provide evidence that&#xD;
      specific subgroups of patients demonstrate substantial compensations with improved recovery,&#xD;
      whereas others reveal limited changes despite similar interventions. Data that detail the&#xD;
      progression of neurological recovery, locomotor recovery, and locomotor compensations&#xD;
      throughout the subacute to chronic phase post-stroke and their responsiveness to HIT is&#xD;
      uncertain. Similar to upper limb recovery algorithms, predictions of mobility outcomes could&#xD;
      provide valuable information to clinicians who make decisions regarding patient's prognosis,&#xD;
      including whether patients will be able to walk with or without assistance or at certain&#xD;
      speeds, and what compensatory strategies they may require to ambulate independently (braces,&#xD;
      devices or altered movement patterns). The overarching goal of this project is to examine the&#xD;
      time course of neurological and locomotor recovery, and associated compensatory strategies,&#xD;
      over the subacute to chronic stages post-stroke and their responsiveness to HIT.&#xD;
