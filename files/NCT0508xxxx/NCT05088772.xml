  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) for any indication at the Hyperbaric&#xD;
      Medicine Unit (University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada) from 2016-2021 were recruited&#xD;
      to this prospective cohort study. While receiving HBOT (at 2.0-2.4 ATA, with 1-3 &quot;air&#xD;
      breaks&quot;, with specific treatment details determined on a case-by-case basis and directed by&#xD;
      the clinical team), enrolled patients underwent pulmonary function testing prior to HBOT&#xD;
      treatment and serially after each 20 completed treatment cycles.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Patients receiving hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) at the Hyperbaric Medicine Unit&#xD;
      (University Health Network, Toronto, ON, Canada) from 2016-2021 were recruited with informed&#xD;
      consent to this prospective cohort study. All included patients underwent HBOT in one of&#xD;
      three monoplace chambers (Sechrist 3600H and Sechrist 4100H, Sechrist Industries Inc.,&#xD;
      Anaheim, CA, USA; PAH-S1-3200, Pan-America Hyperbarics Inc., Plano, TX, USA) or via a plastic&#xD;
      hood in a multiplace chamber (Hyperbaric System, Fink Engineering PTY-LTD, Warana,&#xD;
      Australia). HBOT was performed with 100% oxygen at 2.0-2.4 ATA, with 1-3 &quot;air breaks&quot;,&#xD;
      typically at 5 sessions per week, with limited variation depending on the treatment&#xD;
      indication and patient/clinician decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants completed pulmonary function testing (PFTs) at several intervals during&#xD;
      their HBOT treatment: prior to the first HBOT session, and serially after every 20 subsequent&#xD;
      treatments. PFTs were performed using a KoKo Trek USB Spirometer software and&#xD;
      pneumotachometer (KoKo, USA), with the assistance of a trained technician and in accordance&#xD;
      with industry norms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Retrospectively, PFT data was collected from all enrolled patients' electronic and paper&#xD;
      medical charts. This data included anonymized patient demographics, as well as percentage of&#xD;
      predicted forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), and&#xD;
      forced mid-expiratory flow rates (FEF25-75). PFT values underwent statistical analysis to&#xD;
      identify potential effects of HBOT on pulmonary function.&#xD;
