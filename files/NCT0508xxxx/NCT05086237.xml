  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project will use Twilio as a platform for a text messaging campaign to implement timely&#xD;
      follow up with parents/guardians of children ages 0 to 17 years who have missed Well Child&#xD;
      Visits (WCVs). The first phase of this project was an open trial. This second phase of the&#xD;
      study will be a randomized controlled trial (RCT) to randomly assign parents/guardians of&#xD;
      children who missed a WCV to one of two intervention conditions or no intervention, and&#xD;
      assess reasons for missed visits and experiences at last visit. Parents/guardians will&#xD;
      receive text messages notifying them of missed visits and prompting them to reschedule, as&#xD;
      well as inviting them to complete an online survey. Each reminder message will at minimum&#xD;
      direct parents/guardians to reschedule by phone or by the patient portal. Outcomes of the&#xD;
      follow-up campaign will be evaluated, including rescheduled visits within 6 weeks of missed&#xD;
      visit and attendance at rescheduled visit. This aim will incorporate patient Electronic&#xD;
      Health Record (EHR) data into mixed effects logistic regressions for the primary study&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Well-Child visits (WCV) are an opportunity to maximize the health and future well-being and&#xD;
      development of children. Missed visits, however, can result in negative outcomes for patients&#xD;
      and families and for the healthcare system. For patients, missed primary care visits can&#xD;
      result in greater Emergency Department (ED) visits and hospitalizations, and in delays in&#xD;
      diagnosing a variety of medical conditions, including identification of child abuse and&#xD;
      neglect. For healthcare systems, missed visits result in decreased efficiency, lower quality&#xD;
      measures, decreased provider productivity, and loss in revenue. Although smart phones are&#xD;
      nearly ubiquitous, even among more economically disadvantaged populations, literature to date&#xD;
      has reported only on using text messages for pre-visit reminders. There is a tremendous&#xD;
      opportunity to study use of text messaging to engage families in follow-up for missed WCV.&#xD;
      Even more so, testing the use of text messages with different content is missing, as well as&#xD;
      using text messages to invite patients to share reasons for missing the last WCV.&#xD;
