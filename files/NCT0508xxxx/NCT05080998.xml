  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surveillance for recurrence of urothelial carcinoma (UC) requires frequent cystoscopy, which&#xD;
      is invasive, expensive and time-consuming. An accurate urinary biomarker has the potential to&#xD;
      reduce the number of cystoscopies required during post-treatment surveillance. This is a&#xD;
      prospective single arm multi-center study using the diagnostic Cxbladder test with subjects&#xD;
      previously diagnosed positive with primary or recurrent UC and who are undergoing a schedule&#xD;
      of investigative cystoscopies and treatment for the possible recurrence of urothelial&#xD;
      carcinoma presenting to qualified sites.To test the pathway multiple consecutive urine&#xD;
      samples will be collected during the course of surveillance and records review follow-up will&#xD;
      also be completed.&#xD;

      This is a multi-site study recruiting subjects from Veterans Affairs and other medical&#xD;
      centers. Subjects will be prospectively recruited to an observational study to validate the&#xD;
      performance characteristics and clinical utility of Cxbladder Monitor test (CxbM). The study&#xD;
      will recruit intermediate and high-risk surveillance subjects, defined as per AUA guidelines,&#xD;
      previously diagnosed with urothelial carcinoma (UC).Eligible subjects will include those&#xD;
      under surveillance for recurrence of UC. A strength of the proposed design is that subjects&#xD;
      with primary or recurrence of UC can be recruited. This means, for some subjects, that there&#xD;
      may be a range of surveillance visits prior to enrolment. A voided urine sample will be&#xD;
      collected from each enrolled subject at each of 4 successive surveillance visits. Records&#xD;
      review will occur 12 and 24 months after the final urine sample is collected.The collected&#xD;
      urine will be used for Cxbladder testing and central urine cytology.The study will collect&#xD;
      primary tumour tissue from the first (primary) tumour and also from the most recent&#xD;
      recurrence, if any, in order to genotype each tumour using RNA or DNA markers indicative of&#xD;
      an elevated risk of UC. Cxbladder results will not be reported to patients or physicians.The&#xD;
      objective of this study is to evaluate a new proposed pathway over a period of up to four&#xD;
      visits where CxbM is alternated with cystoscopy at consecutive visits for intermediate and&#xD;
      high-risk surveillance subjects. The new proposed pathway will be compared directly to&#xD;
      standard of care. Analysis of data will include determining the proportion of subjects that&#xD;
      are positive by surveillance cystoscopy (standard of care) following a negative diagnosis at&#xD;
      the previous visit. Using the same dataset, analysis of data will include determining the&#xD;
      proportion of subjects that are positive by surveillance cystoscopy (standard of care)&#xD;
      following a negative Cxbladder result at the previous visit. Analysis will include assessment&#xD;
      of the theoretical possible reduction in cystoscopy procedure use associated with the new&#xD;
      pathway. Sites are required to be competent in recruiting and completing required test&#xD;
      request forms, Case Report Forms (CRF) and sample collection in a professional manner in&#xD;
      accordance with good clinical practice (GCP).&#xD;

    <description>The failure rate will be measured as the proportion of all subjects experiencing a failure event. A failure event for the proposed pathway is defined as any visit where standard of care cystoscopy is confirmed as positive for a given visit when Cxbladder Monitor was negative at the immediate previous visit. A failure event for the standard of care is defined as any visit where standard of care cystoscopy is confirmed as positive for a given visit when standard of care cystoscopy was negative at the immediate previous visit. (The gold standard for determination of a confirmed clinical diagnosis is cystoscopy and any other procedures relating to the visit with confirmation by pathology following review of a biopsy specimen).</description>
