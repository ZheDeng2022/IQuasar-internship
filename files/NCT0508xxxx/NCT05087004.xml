  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized controlled trial (RCT) evaluation of the Teen Council program that was&#xD;
      tested with high school students (grades 10-12) to assess whether it results in a reduction&#xD;
      of teen pregnancy among other outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Over the course of five years, we expected to have approximately 800 teens (400 program and&#xD;
      400 control) in the study. Teens were randomly selected for the program (Teen Council) and&#xD;
      control (no program) conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teens in both groups were surveyed in the late summer/early fall of their enrollment year and&#xD;
      each spring thereafter. Participation in the evaluation by control teens and unenrolled&#xD;
      program teens was recognized with a small stipend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pre-survey was administered during the summer retreat for incoming Teen Council members.&#xD;
      The same survey was administered by Philliber staff for the control youth via online,&#xD;
      telephone, or mailed surveys during the late summer/fall. The post-surveys were administered&#xD;
      at the end of the school year. Again, the survey was administered by program facilitators for&#xD;
      the Teen Council program group. Philliber administered the post survey for the control group&#xD;
      providing the same options for completion (online, telephone, or mail).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To facilitate follow-up, complete contact information was collected at baseline. This&#xD;
      included the telephone numbers, physical addresses, and email addresses of the student and&#xD;
      telephone numbers of their parents/guardians. Also requested was contact information for two&#xD;
      relatives or adult friends who would likely know how to contact the teen. Parents were asked&#xD;
      on the consent form to provide permission to receive change of school information in the&#xD;
      event that their teen transferred to a new school. Philliber reached out to unenrolled Teen&#xD;
      Council members and control group teens by telephone, email, text messaging, and/or U.S. Mail&#xD;
      for survey administration (via telephone, online, or hard copy).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participating Planned Parenthood affiliates recruited teens to their Teen Council program each study year during the spring and summer months. Interested teens completed an application and, if after review they were deemed by the program to be good candidates, they were interviewed. Active consent was obtained from the parents or guardians of all eligible youth and teen assent was also collected. Twice as many qualified applicants as spots on each Teen Council were accepted and their names were submitted to Philliber for random assignment to the program or survey-only groups.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>Two items about teen comfort talking with parents about sex and birth control, rated 1 to 4, with 4 indicating the highest level of comfort. These two items were examined individually. A third item measured whether youth had conversations with parents about sexuality or birth control in the past year (yes/no). A final item had teens report the number of such conversations in five unequal categories (0,1-5, 6-10, 11-15, and more than 15), then dichotomized to 10 or fewer conversations (0) and more than ten conversations (1).</description>

    <description>Youth randomly selected for Teen Council attended weekly meetings for an entire school year to receive training on specific topics. In turn, they provided educational presentations to the community, which required that they miss school (about one day per month). The presentations Teen Council members offered in middle and high schools were most commonly on birth control methods; relationships; reproductive anatomy and physiology; sexual diversity; STDs/STIs; sexual consent; HIV/AIDS; and abstinence.</description>
