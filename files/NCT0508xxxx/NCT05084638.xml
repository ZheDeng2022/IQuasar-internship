  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the impact of ofatumumab in Relapsing Remitting Multiple Sclerosis&#xD;
      (RRMS) participants that are very early in the course of their disease using clinical and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes. The study will also assess changes in disease&#xD;
      using monitoring techniques including digital biometric device use, biomarker analysis and&#xD;
      non-conventional MRI. Select outcomes in the ofatumumab treated group will be compared to a&#xD;
      group of Healthy participants to determine if there are similarities between the groups after&#xD;
      the patients with MS undergo treatment with ofatumumab.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, multi-center, prospective 18-month study in 118 MS participants&#xD;
      with early RRMS (defined as within 6 months of diagnosis of clinically definite RRMS) and who&#xD;
      are treatment naïve. It is designed to determine if RRMS participants treated with 20 mg&#xD;
      subcutaneous monthly ofatumumab during the earliest part of their disease will benefit from&#xD;
      the use of ofatumumab as their first disease modifying therapy. Additionally, RRMS patients&#xD;
      will be compared to age- and sex-matched healthy participants (n=50) for select outcomes to&#xD;
      observe similarities and differences between the groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After giving consent, participants will have a 28-day screening/qualification period. If they&#xD;
      qualify to continue, they will start study measures including assessments of clinical and&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) metrics and use of a digital monitoring watch. Additionally,&#xD;
      samples will be collected for laboratory and biomarker analysis. RRMS participants will begin&#xD;
      treatment with ofatumumab for the next 18 months. Healthy participants will undergo similar&#xD;
      assessments; however they will not receive any treatment during the course of the study. Over&#xD;
      the 18 months, participants will have regular clinical visits with assessments and sample&#xD;
      collection. After 18 months in the trial, participants in both groups will have the option to&#xD;
      enter into a 12-month extension (up to 30 months total in study) to collect further&#xD;
      information on long-term clinical and MRI outcomes.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Month 6 to month 18</time_frame>
    <description>A participant is considered as achieved NEDA-3 if the participant has not had a clinical relapse (recurrence of a disease activity after a recovery), has not had an increase in disability and has no new radiological MRI activity (no new occurrences of contrast-enhancing lesions) during study Months 6 to 18.</description>

    <measure>Number of relapses</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to Month 18 and 30</time_frame>
    <description>Relapses are recurrences of a disease activity after a recovery. A confirmed MS relapse is one accompanied by a clinically relevant change in the EDSS performed by the EDSS Rater, i.e. an increase of at least 0.5 points on the EDSS score, or an increase of 1 point on two functional scores (FSs) or 2 points on one FS, excluding changes involving bowel/bladder or cerebral FS compared to the previous available rating (the last EDSS rating that did not occur during a relapse). Confirmation of MS relapse based on these definitions will be done centrally.</description>
