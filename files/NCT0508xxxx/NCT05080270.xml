  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibroblasts have demonstrated potent immune modulatory and therapeutic activity in the&#xD;
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, as well as in&#xD;
      other models of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess primary safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of intravenous&#xD;
      administration of 100 million tolerogenic fibroblasts to 5 patients with relapsing remitting&#xD;
      MS resistant to interferon. While the safety of fibroblasts administered clinically is&#xD;
      established, it is unknown whether these cells are effective in the treatment of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that the tolerogenic fibroblasts will be well-tolerated and meet our&#xD;
      primary objective. In addition, The investigators are optimistic that they will see signs of&#xD;
      efficacy based on the following: Neurological assessment of the MS functional composite&#xD;
      assessment which comprises of EDSS, the expanded EDSS (Rating Neurologic Impairment in&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis, the Scripps neurological rating scale (NRS), paced auditory serial&#xD;
      addition test (PASAT), the nine-hole peg test, and 25-foot walking time, short-form 36&#xD;
      (SF-36) quality of life questionnaire and gadolinium-enhanced MRI scans of the brain and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Fibroblasts have demonstrated potent immune modulatory and therapeutic activity in the&#xD;
      experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) model of multiple sclerosis, as well as in&#xD;
      other models of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. Mechanistically, tolerogenic&#xD;
      fibroblasts produce anti-inflammatory and immune modulatory factors, which appear to be&#xD;
      therapeutic in the context of autoimmunity, including IL-10 and TGF-beta. Additionally,&#xD;
      tolerogenic fibroblasts produce neurotrophic mediators that enhance myelin production and/or&#xD;
      prevent neuronal apoptosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will assess primary safety and secondary efficacy endpoints of intravenous&#xD;
      administration of 100 million tolerogenic fibroblasts to 5 patients with relapsing remitting&#xD;
      MS resistant to interferon. While the safety of fibroblasts administered clinically is&#xD;
      established, it is unknown whether these cells are effective in the treatment of multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Hypothesis: Intravenous administration of 100 million tolerogenic fibroblasts will&#xD;
      be well tolerated and induce a therapeutic effect in relapse remitting MS patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: The family of Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) is immune-modulatory, and bone marrow&#xD;
      MSCs (BM-MSCs) have induced therapeutic responses in patients with MS [1]. Tolerogenic&#xD;
      fibroblasts possess superior immune modulatory activity compared to BM-MSCs and adipose MSCs.&#xD;
      The investigators, therefore, seek to perform a five-patient trial to assess the safety and&#xD;
      signs of efficacy of this cell population in MS patients resistant to interferon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial's primary objective is freedom from treatment-associated adverse events at 1, 2, 4,&#xD;
      8, and 16 weeks post-treatment. The study's secondary objective will be efficacy as assessed&#xD;
      at baseline, weeks 2, 4, 8, and 16. The results will be quantified based on the following:&#xD;
      Neurological assessment of the MS functional composite assessment, which comprises of EDSS,&#xD;
      the expanded EDSS (Rating Neurologic Impairment in Multiple Sclerosis, the Scripps&#xD;
      neurological rating scale (NRS), paced auditory serial addition test (PASAT), the nine-hole&#xD;
      peg test, and 25-foot walking time, short-form 36 (SF-36) quality of life questionnaire and&#xD;
      gadolinium-enhanced MRI scans of the brain and cervical spinal cord.&#xD;

    <description>This test will measure the amount of certain substances in serum samples, including electrolytes (such as sodium, potassium, and chloride), fats, proteins, glucose (sugar), and enzymes. Blood chemistry tests give essential information about how well a person's kidneys, liver, and other organs are working. An abnormal amount of a substance in the blood can be a sign of disease or a side effect of treatment. Blood chemistry tests help diagnose and monitor many conditions before, during, and after treatment. Also called blood chemistry study.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy: Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) to quantify disability scale and monitors changes</measure>
    <time_frame>Day before infusion to establish a baseline, week 8, and week 16 after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) quantifies disability in multiple sclerosis and monitors changes in the level of disability over time. The test is based on neurological examination and impact on Functional Systems representing network of neurons in the brain. It is widely used in clinical trials and the assessment of people with MS. The scale was developed by a neurologist called John Kurtzke in 1983 as an advance from his previous 10 step Disability Status Scale (DSS). The EDSS scale ranges from 0 to 10 in 0.5 unit increments that represent higher levels of disability. Scoring is based on an examination by a neurologist.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy: Paced Auditory Serial Addition Test (PASAT) to measure cognitive function and processing speed</measure>
    <time_frame>Day before infusion to establish a baseline, week 8, and week 16 after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>PASAT is a measure of cognitive function that assesses auditory information processing speed, flexibility, and calculation ability. The test was developed by Gronwell in 1977 and later adapted by Rao and colleagues in 1989 for use in MS. The PASAT is presented using audio cassette tape or compact disk to ensure standardization in the rate of stimulus presentation. In the test, single digits are presented every 3 seconds, and the patient must add each new digit to the one immediately prior to it. Shorter inter-stimulus intervals, e.g., 2 seconds or less, have also been used with the PASAT but tend to increase the difficulty of the task.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy: Nine-Hole Peg Test to measure and quantify upper extermity function</measure>
    <time_frame>Day before infusion to establish a baseline, week 8, and week 16 after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The 9-HPT is a brief, standardized, quantitative test of upper extremity function. Both the dominant and non-dominant hands are tested twice. The patient is seated at a table with a small, shallow container holding nine pegs and a wood or plastic block containing nine empty holes. On a start command when a stopwatch is started, the patient picks up the nine pegs one at a time as quickly as possible, puts them in the nine holes, and, once they are in the holes, removes them again as quickly as possible one at a time, replacing them into the shallow container. The total time to complete the task is recorded. Two consecutive trials with the dominant hand are immediately followed by two consecutive trials with the non-dominant hand.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Efficacy: Timed 25-Foot Walk Test to quantify mobility and leg function</measure>
    <time_frame>Day before infusion to establish a baseline, week 8, and week 16 after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>The T25-FW is a quantitative mobility and leg function performance test based on a timed 25-walk. The patient is directed to one end of a clearly marked 25-foot course and is instructed to walk 25 feet as quickly as possible but safely. The time is calculated from the initiation of the instruction to start and ends when the patient has reached the 25-foot mark. The task is immediately administered again by having the patient walk back the same distance. Patients may use assistive devices when doing this task.</description>

    <measure>Efficacy: Gadolinium Enhanced MRI to detect demyelinated areas of the nerves</measure>
    <time_frame>Day before infusion to establish a baseline, and week 16 after infusion</time_frame>
    <description>Gadolinium Enhanced MRI is used to detect demyelinated areas of the nerves in the brain and cervical spinal cord. These Damaged areas can be observed by MRI presented as plaques, and the intensity of the plaques can determine the age of multiple sclerosis caused lesions.</description>
