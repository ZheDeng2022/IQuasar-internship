    <textblock>
      Acute rejection after kidney transplantation should ideally be diagnosed prior to immunologic&#xD;
      injury in a non-invasive fashion in order to improve long-term graft function. Donor-derived&#xD;
      cell-free DNA (ddcfDNA) is a promising method to do so as it is elevated prior to acute&#xD;
      rejection and has good predictive performance especially for antibody-mediated and high&#xD;
      severity T-cell mediated rejection. Its ability to predict low severity T-cell mediated&#xD;
      rejection and future graft function remains equivocal. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are&#xD;
      essential in transplant tolerance by suppressing effector immune responses. Circulating&#xD;
      post-transplant highly suppressive HLA-DR+ Tregs were reduced in recipients who developed&#xD;
      acute rejection. Preliminary results in a cohort including predominantly low severity T-cell&#xD;
      mediated rejection also showed that pre-transplant circulating highly suppressive TNFR2+&#xD;
      Tregs were reduced in and could predict acute rejection. Integrating dd-cfDNA with&#xD;
      HLA-DR+TNFR2+ Treg could improve the predictive performance for acute rejection especially of&#xD;
      low severity and potentially predict graft function. Plasma dd-cfDNA and HLA-DR+TNFR2+ Tregs&#xD;
      will be measured in 150 kidney transplant recipients at scheduled intervals during the first&#xD;
      6 months post-transplant. Predictive accuracy of a model integrating ddcfDNA and&#xD;
      HLA-DR+TNFR2+ Treg for acute rejection will be tested using ROC curve analysis and&#xD;
      multivariate logistic regression. Predictive accuracy for 1-year graft function will be&#xD;
      tested using multivariate linear regression. High predictive performance for acute rejection&#xD;
      and graft function using a model integrating dd-cfDNA and HLA-DR+TNFR2+ Treg would help&#xD;
      identify kidney transplant recipients at immunologic risk early on and allow personalization&#xD;
      of immunosuppression accordingly.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite advances in immunosuppression, 10-year graft survival after kidney transplantation&#xD;
      has remained stagnant at around 50%. Timely diagnosis of acute rejection in kidney transplant&#xD;
      recipients is essential for improving long-term graft survival. Clinical suspicion for acute&#xD;
      rejection currently relies on monitoring elevation in serum creatinine and diagnostic&#xD;
      confirmation with a kidney allograft biopsy. Serum creatinine elevation, however, is&#xD;
      non-specific for acute rejection and is detected after significant immunological damage to&#xD;
      the allograft already happens. Confirmation with a biopsy is invasive, associated with a 1%&#xD;
      major complication rate, and subjected to inadequate sampling as well as expert reader&#xD;
      variance. Novel ways to monitor and diagnose acute rejection prior to immunological injury in&#xD;
      a non-invasive fashion are needed in an effort to improve long-term graft survival after&#xD;
      kidney transplantation. Cell-free DNA is normally released into the bloodstream when cells&#xD;
      undergo apoptosis or necrosis. In the context of kidney transplantation and the presence of&#xD;
      an allograft, donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is continuously shed into the&#xD;
      bloodstream of the recipient as a result of allograft cell turnover and represents a small&#xD;
      fraction of total cell-free DNA (donor- plus recipient-derived). Dd-cfDNA fraction is&#xD;
      initially high from ischemia-reperfusion injury and usually decreases to a baseline level 10&#xD;
      to 14 days after kidney transplantation. Subsequently, episodes of allograft injury such as&#xD;
      acute rejection leads to an increase in dd-cfDNA fraction into the recipient's bloodstream.&#xD;
      Using single-nucleotide polymorphisms-based multiplexed polymerase chain reaction technology&#xD;
      and advanced bioinformatics, plasma dd-cfDNA fraction can now be measured in a kidney&#xD;
      transplant recipient without the need for prior genotyping of the donor or the recipient.&#xD;
      Recent studies have demonstrated that plasma dd-cfDNA is a promising novel method to detect&#xD;
      acute rejection prior to immunological injury in a non-invasive fashion as it is elevated in&#xD;
      advance and at the time of biopsy-proven acute rejection. A cutoff dd-cfDNA fraction greater&#xD;
      or equal to 1% was able to predict acute rejection with moderate to good performance in those&#xD;
      studies with area under the curves (AUCs) varying from 0.59 - 0.97 on receiver operating&#xD;
      characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. When examining acute rejection by mechanism, dd-cfDNA&#xD;
      fraction appears to have better predictive performance for antibody-mediated rejection&#xD;
      (ABMR), while its utility to predict T cell-mediated rejection (TCMR) remains equivocal&#xD;
      especially when of lower severity (less than Banff 1B). Nevertheless, in lower severity TCMR&#xD;
      (Banff 1A or subclinical), a dd-cfDNA fraction greater or equal to 0.5% was shown to&#xD;
      potentially identify kidney transplant recipients at risk for a steeper estimated glomerular&#xD;
      filtration rate (eGFR) decline, developing de-novo donor specific antibody, and future&#xD;
      rejection episodes. Despite being approved for clinical use by Medicare, several limitations&#xD;
      remain with dd-cfDNA in the prediction of acute rejection. First, elevation in dd-cfDNA is&#xD;
      not rejection-specific as other medical complications such as urinary tract infections,&#xD;
      systemic infections, and BK virus nephropathy can also increase dd-cfDNA. Secondly,&#xD;
      predictive performance of dd-cfDNA for TCMR, especially of lower severity, remains equivocal.&#xD;
      Finally, it is unclear whether early dd-cfDNA fraction after kidney transplantation can&#xD;
      predict future immunologic graft injuries and function. Novel ways to make dd-cfDNA more&#xD;
      specific for acute rejection, improve its predictive performance for TCMR, and correlate it&#xD;
      with future graft function would further improve its clinical utility. Regulatory T cells&#xD;
      (Tregs) are essential in the induction and maintenance of tolerance in various kidney&#xD;
      transplant animal models by suppressing effector immune responses. Tregs constitute 5 - 10%&#xD;
      of CD4+ T cells and are traditionally identified as a homogeneous population with high&#xD;
      expression of CD25, low expression of CD127, and expression of the master transcription&#xD;
      factor FoxP3. Recent data, however, indicate that Tregs are more heterogeneous and that&#xD;
      expression of additional molecules than the traditional CD25, CD127, and FoxP3 influence&#xD;
      their suppressive functional activity. In human kidney transplantation, posttransplant&#xD;
      circulating CD4+CD25hiCD127lo/- Tregs were similar between recipients who suffered from acute&#xD;
      rejection and those that did not. However, high expression of HLA-DR on post-transplant&#xD;
      circulating Tregs, which identified a population with maximally suppressive functional&#xD;
      activity, was lower in recipients who suffered from acute rejection. Another molecule&#xD;
      identifying a Treg population with maximally suppressive functional activity is TNFR2. TNFR2&#xD;
      mediates the biological function of the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a, which is involved in&#xD;
      the recruitment and activation of effector T cells during allograft rejection. Interestingly,&#xD;
      TNFR2 was shown to be preferentially expressed on Tregs as opposed to effector T cells. In&#xD;
      both murine and human studies, TNF-Î± signaling via TNFR2+ Tregs increased their survival,&#xD;
      proliferation, and suppressive functional activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results The investigators previously studied TNFR2+ Tregs in the specific context&#xD;
      of kidney transplantation. The investigators confirmed in a cohort of kidney transplant&#xD;
      candidates that expression of TNFR2 on Tregs correlated with suppressive function measured&#xD;
      via a traditional co-culture assay of Tregs with stimulated effector T cells (r=0.63,&#xD;
      p&lt;0.01). In a cohort of 76 deceased donor kidney transplant recipients, the investigators&#xD;
      published on the role of pre-transplant circulating recipient TNFR2+ Tregs in the prediction&#xD;
      of delayed and slow graft function after kidney transplantation. Since delayed and slow graft&#xD;
      function are known risk factors for the development of acute rejection after kidney&#xD;
      transplantation, the investigators then examined the role of pre-transplant circulating&#xD;
      recipient TNFR2+ Tregs in the prediction of acute rejection in the same cohort of recipients&#xD;
      in which 75 had available acute rejection data with promising results especially with low&#xD;
      severity TCMR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since previous studies and the investigators' preliminary results in a cohort predominantly&#xD;
      including low severity TCMR suggest a role for HLA-DR+TNFR2+ Tregs in the prediction of acute&#xD;
      rejection, the investigators hypothesize that integrating it with dd-cfDNA fraction could&#xD;
      improve specificity and predictive performance for acute rejection, especially TCMR. The&#xD;
      investigators also hypothesize that measurement of early dd-cfDNA fraction and pretransplant&#xD;
      HLA-DR+TNFR2+ Tregs could predict future outcomes after kidney transplantation including&#xD;
      acute rejection and graft function measured by eGFR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Test whether integrating dd-cfDNA fraction with HLA-DR+TNFR2+ Tregs in advance or at the&#xD;
           time of allograft injury can improve the predictive performance for acute rejection&#xD;
           after kidney transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Test whether integrating dd-cfDNA fraction at 2 weeks post-transplant with&#xD;
           pre-transplant HLADR+TNFR2+ Tregs can predict future acute rejection episodes and 1-year&#xD;
           graft function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will recruit 150 adult kidney transplant recipients with insurance coverage&#xD;
      for dd-cfDNA fraction measurement.&#xD;
