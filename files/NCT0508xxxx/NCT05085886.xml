  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a multi-level intervention -&#xD;
      centered around a web-application that facilitates depression screening, automated shared&#xD;
      decision making (SDM), patient activation, and psychoeducation - on mental health treatment&#xD;
      optimization among patients with elevated depressive symptoms with or without co-morbid&#xD;
      anxiety receiving care in primary care clinics that offer collaborative care. The objectives&#xD;
      of the study include: Leveraging user centered design to refine an electronic SDM (eSDM) tool&#xD;
      (aim 1), and assessing the effect of the eSDM tool on provider behavior (aim 2) and on&#xD;
      patient enrollment in depression treatment (aim 3).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Collaborative care, a team-based approach to integrating primary and behavioral health, is&#xD;
      effective in reducing depressive and anxiety symptoms and improving clinical outcomes.&#xD;
      However, attempts to optimize collaborative care in real world settings have been hindered by&#xD;
      patient (stigma, low self-efficacy, low perceived treatment efficacy), provider (suboptimal&#xD;
      symptom recognition and communication at referral), and system (limited resources, lack of&#xD;
      screening) level barriers. Few if any prior studies have focused on assessing the&#xD;
      effectiveness of multi-level strategies to optimize treatment engagement in primary care&#xD;
      settings in the sustainability phase of collaborative care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using the behavior change wheel (BCW) framework, we created a multi-level strategy for&#xD;
      optimizing treatment in primary care settings with collaborative care programs. The strategy&#xD;
      involves patient-level electronic screening, patient activation, and an automated shared&#xD;
      decision-making tool in addition to primary care provider-level behavioral health education&#xD;
      with automated decisional support.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators now aim to test this multifaceted implementation strategy for optimizing&#xD;
      treatment amongst patients with elevated depressive symptoms (with or without co-morbid&#xD;
      anxiety) in the ambulatory care network (ACN) clinics of New York Presbyterian Hospital&#xD;
      (NYPH) with established/mature collaborative care programs that predominantly care for&#xD;
      socioeconomically disadvantaged and minority patients. We will randomize providers to either&#xD;
      the multicomponent strategy or enhanced usual care. The investigators aim to assess the&#xD;
      effectiveness of this intervention on patient engagement in mental health treatment (primary&#xD;
      outcome) as well as on provider action to optimize/manage treatment (secondary outcome).&#xD;
