      To explore the feasibility, efficacy and safety of determining the treatment regimen based on&#xD;
      genomic profiling in patients with locally advanced and advanced salivary gland cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, non-randomized single-center study to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of using molecular profile-based evidence to guide personalized therapy for&#xD;
      patients with incurable salivary gland carcinoma patients. Comprehensive Genomic Profiling is&#xD;
      performed on tissue with assessment of tumor mutation burden (TMB) status, and additional&#xD;
      PD-L1 immunohistochemistry testing. Study Committee or Molecular Tumor Board (MTB) will&#xD;
      recommend matched therapy, if available, following analysis of patient genomic profiles. The&#xD;
      final treatment administered will be based on the treating physician's choice with MTB&#xD;
      advice, patient preference, comorbidity considerations, and available drug access. Access to&#xD;
      medication followed real-world practice.&#xD;
