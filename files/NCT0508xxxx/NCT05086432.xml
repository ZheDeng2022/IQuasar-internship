  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD) there is thickening of lung tissue, which makes it&#xD;
      difficult for patients to breathe and get enough oxygen into their bodies. In addition to&#xD;
      shortness of breath, daily cough is very common, with 4 out of 5 patients experiencing this&#xD;
      symptom. Cough in particular has a major impact on the ability to exercise, be active, and to&#xD;
      simply enjoy life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are many reasons for cough in ILD, and very often there are multiple overlapping&#xD;
      causes. It is hard to improve cough in these patients, with available medicines providing&#xD;
      limited relief. One explanation for this gap is an incomplete understanding of cough in ILD.&#xD;
      To improve patients' cough there is a need to better understand its cause. In other lung&#xD;
      diseases, such as asthma, doctors and scientists have used phlegm tests to measure&#xD;
      inflammation in the lung, which helps them choose the right medicine for the right patient.&#xD;
      This has not been done for ILD, even though it has recently been found that many patients&#xD;
      with ILD and everyday cough have abnormal phlegm tests. Using this strategy in ILD could&#xD;
      improve patients' cough and quality of life, and possibly even slow progression of the&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;

      SpECC-ILD is an open-label, randomized controlled trial assessing the efficacy of&#xD;
      sputum-guided management (using sputum cytometry) compared to standard care over 16 weeks in&#xD;
      patients with chronic cough and ILD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 80 participants will be enrolled and randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either sputum&#xD;
      guided therapy or standard of care for a total of 16 weeks. Participants randomized to the&#xD;
      intervention arm will receive open-label sputum-guided management of airway inflammation&#xD;
      identified during screening. Participants in this arm will receive standard of care treatment&#xD;
      as determined by their ILD specialist who will be blinded to the results of the sputum&#xD;
      analysis.&#xD;

    <description>During Weeks 0 to 16, participants randomized to the intervention arm will receive open-label sputum-guided management of airway inflammation (Table 1 in protocol) identified during screening (Figure 2 in protocol). Airway eosinophilia will be treated with regular inhaled corticosteroids based on the severity of eosinophilic inflammation. In participants with airway neutrophilia, as per the standard of care, sputum culture and sensitivity will be sent, and pathogenic organisms treated. Those participants with airway neutrophilia with negative cultures will be treated with thrice weekly Azithromycin (250mg). Combined eosinophilia and neutrophilia will receive treatment with both ICS and Azithromycin as per Table 2 in protocol.</description>
