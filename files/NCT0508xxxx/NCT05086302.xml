      A prospective, Multicenter open-label post approval trial for adults with a Body Mass Index&#xD;
      (BMI) of 35.0-40.0 kg/m2 or a BMI of 30.0 to 34.9 kg/m2 with one or more major&#xD;
      obesity-related comorbid conditions who have failed to achieve and maintain weight-loss with&#xD;
      a supervised weight control program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims to demonstrate that the safety of the device in the post market setting is&#xD;
      comparable to what was observed in the US pivotal study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to demonstrate that the safety of the device in the postmarket&#xD;
      setting is comparable to what was observed in the US pivotal study and to more accurately&#xD;
      determine the rates of certain serious adverse events so that this information can be used to&#xD;
      inform patient labeling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects in the open label, multi-center study will receive dietary/exercise counseling plus&#xD;
      the Spatz3 Adjustable Balloon System for 32 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects will undergo endoscopy and those without endoscopic contraindications will&#xD;
      be implanted with the Spatz3 Adjustable Balloon System for 32 weeks. All subjects will follow&#xD;
      a 1000-1200 kcal/day-deficit diet during their participation in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 18 weeks ±4 weeks, subjects will be evaluated, and those that meet the criteria will&#xD;
      undergo an adjustment procedure wherein the balloon volume will be increased to achieve extra&#xD;
      weight loss. The balloon adjustment procedure is done with an endoscopy procedure under the&#xD;
      same sedation as the implantation procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 32-week treatment period, all subjects who lost at least 5% Total Body&#xD;
      Weight Loss (TBWL) prior to device removal will be followed for an additional 6 months. In&#xD;
      addition, patients with device- and/or procedure-related adverse events will be followed&#xD;
      until resolution of the event&#xD;
