  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Black women have a significantly higher risk of acquiring HIV compared to their non-Black&#xD;
      counterparts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to refine and test a mobile HIV Prevention and Reproductive&#xD;
      Health app developed specifically for Black women.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal in implementing this study will be to assess the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and usability of the in-the-kNOW mobile app. The app will be refined using preliminary data&#xD;
      obtained through prior research with Black women in which their perspectives towards the use&#xD;
      of an HIV and sexual health mobile app were ascertained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data obtained from a Community Advisory Board (CAB), which will consist&#xD;
      predominately of Black women will guide refinement of the content and features included&#xD;
      within the mobile app, whilst ensuring that the app is tailored towards the needs and&#xD;
      perspectives of Black women.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a randomized study with quantitative data collected through surveys, and&#xD;
      qualitative data collected through in-depth interviews.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>in-the-kNOW mobile app</intervention_name>
    <description>in-the-kNOW is a mobile app with restricted access through a single-use registration code.&#xD;
The app will be developed with regular input from Black women enrolled in Atlanta Healthy Start Initiative (AHSI).&#xD;
The app will have culturally- and contextually targeted HIV prevention and optimal sexual health messaging.&#xD;
Each participant will have 4 months to engage with the app, with e-reminders in time intervals preferred by the participants (a minimum of 3 times per week) via push notifications. During the 4-month study period, participants will receive push notifications to encourage the use of all app domains: My Logger, My Test, My Resources, and My Circle.&#xD;
Research staff will complete 2-month check-ins via phone call or video chat with participants.</description>

    <description>The control condition will be a one-time virtual women's health counseling session with a healthcare provider. Participants will get information on&#xD;
Sexual Transmitted Infections (STI)/HIV prevention,&#xD;
Family planning, and&#xD;
General health promotion (e.g., exercise and diet).&#xD;
The control condition provides access to HIV prevention materials that are publicly available but that do not offer the dynamic and individually customized features of the health communication/new media research approach proposed herein.&#xD;
Control group participants will continue to receive the usual care associated with Atlanta Healthy Start Initiative (AHSI) enrollment.&#xD;
The control group will not have access to intervention content (e.g. commodity ordering) until after the study has concluded.&#xD;
Research staff will complete 2-month check-ins via phone call or video chat with participants.</description>
