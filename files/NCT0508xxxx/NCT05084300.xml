  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic, complex and disabling clinical entity that has an average&#xD;
      global prevalence of 2.7%. It occurs mainly in women in a 3: 1 ratio. It is characterized by&#xD;
      persistent generalized pain, fatigue, unrefreshing sleep, cognitive dysfunction and numerous&#xD;
      systemic symptoms such as dizziness, migraine, digestive alterations or sensory intolerances.&#xD;
      At present there is no pharmacological treatment with specific indication for FM. Usually,&#xD;
      non-curative treatments are recommended that alleviate the symptoms of the patients and&#xD;
      improve their quality of life and functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many studies have shown cognitive impairment in FM patients compared to control groups, and&#xD;
      FM patients mainly show problems with working memory processes and / or in their attentional&#xD;
      and executive domains, as well as in speed of speech. processing (BD Dick, Verrier, Harker, &amp;&#xD;
      Rashiq, 2008; Glass, 2009; Tesio et al., 2015; Williams, Clauw, &amp; Glass, 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with FM have little understanding of their condition, leading to maladaptive&#xD;
      pain cognitions and coping strategies. Current research has suggested the use of&#xD;
      physiotherapy and rehabilitation in addition to cognitive patient education in the treatment&#xD;
      of fibromyalgia. This study aimed to explore the effectiveness of pain neuroscience education&#xD;
      in patients with FM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, this research aims to analyze the effectiveness of the neuroscience education&#xD;
      program on pain in executive functions and the intensity of pain in patients with FM.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The design of the present study will be a parallel-group randomized controlled trial that&#xD;
      will be performed between september 2021 and march 2022.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total = 62 patients. Experimental: PNE (31), Control: Usal care (31). Experimental: In&#xD;
      individualized sessions to 31 patients, a health professional will explain the neurological&#xD;
      mechanisms that are behind the perception of pain, fatigue and illness from the recent&#xD;
      knowledge in neuroscience about brain and pain, as well as the brain's ability to change&#xD;
      patien´s behaviour thanks to neuroplasticity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be 10 sessions of 35 minutes, 2 times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each week the contents of the class and other complementary materials will be sent to the&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      He outcomes will be assessed at baseline (t1) and one week after intervention (t2). Written&#xD;
      informed consent will be acquired for all participants prior to their participation. The&#xD;
      study will be implemented and reported in line with the CONSORT statement.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and through intervention's completion, 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The WCST measures cognitive processes such as administrative control, characterization, perseveration, executive function, conceptualization, abstract thinking and reasoning, and it is mainly linked to frontal lobe .&#xD;
Commonly used neuropsychological computerized test to assess the ability to form abstract concepts, to shift and maintain set, and to utilize feedback. Total number of categories completed and perseverative errors (reported as t-score with range &lt;20 to &gt;80) will be reported. Higher values indicate better outcome.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Visual-spatial working memory span measured by Corsi Block-Tapping task</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and through intervention's completion, 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The paradigm was computer-adaptive, and thus the set size would only increase if the participant passed consecutive two trials of the same span. The lowest span level started from 2 (2 squares that change color) and up to 9 as maximum.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Stroop Color-word Task</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and through intervention's completion, 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>In the Stroop, the participant is required to name the color of the ink in which a word is printed while inhibiting the overlearned response of reading the word (e.g., the word ''red'' might be printed in blue ink). The number of errors were subtracted from the time required (RT; Reaction Time) for each of the 3 trials, yielding three summary scores. The derived interference score is obtained by subtracting the RT for the first trial from the RT for the third trial.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in Central Sensitization Inventory Score (CSI)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and through intervention's completion, 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) is a scale used to detect patients with symptoms associated with central sensitization or types of central sensitization syndrome such as fibromyalgia, temporomandibular joint disease, tension type headache, migraine.&#xD;
The Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) consists of two parts:&#xD;
Part A consists of 25 questions about central sensitization syndrome (CNS) symptoms; Section B examines the patient's condition of being diagnosed with certain CNS diseases or CNS related diseases such as anxiety and depression.&#xD;
The patient answers 25 questions in section A with a score between 0 and 4. The total score will be between 0-100. Results above 40 points indicate central sensitization.</description>

    <measure>Change in Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS)</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and through intervention's completion, 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>The PCS is measured with a self-administered questionnaire. The Pain Catastrophizing Scale is a 13-item inventory that measures 3 elements of the perception of the intensity of pain (rumination, magnification, feeling helpless). Participants indicate the degree to which they agree with statements related their pain by selecting 0 = not at all, 1 = to a slight degree, 2 = to a moderate degree, 3 = to a great degree, 4 = all the time. There are three subscale scores assessing rumination, magnification and helplessness. All subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating the participant is having more thoughts about the pain they feel helplessness. All subscales are summed to produce a total score ranging from 0 to 52 with higher scores indicating the participant is having more thoughts about the pain they feel.</description>

    <measure>Minimental State Examination Folstein</measure>
    <time_frame>at baseline and through intervention's completion, 5 weeks.</time_frame>
    <description>Mini-Cognitive Lobo est (MEC). To assess the cognitive status before inclusion in the study, the spanish version of Folstein's Minimental State Examination is used. Adapted and validated by Lobo in Spain in 1979. It is a brief cognitive test that consists of the evaluation of the most important cognitive areas (orientation, concentration, calculation, memory, language and construction) with a global maximum score of 35 (30-35 = normal, 24-29 = borderline, &lt;24 in people over 65). The MEC has widely shown its reliability, validity and discriminative power, with a specificity of 75.1% and a sensitivity of 89.8%.</description>
