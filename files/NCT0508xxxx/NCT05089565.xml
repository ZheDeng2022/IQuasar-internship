    <textblock>
      People with sarcoidosis, particularly those with significant lung and/or cardiac involvement,&#xD;
      who become infected with severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) are&#xD;
      likely at increased risk of complications or death from COVID-19. While SARS-CoV-2 vaccines&#xD;
      are highly efficacious in preventing COVID-19 in the general population, whether vaccination&#xD;
      provides similar protection in people with sarcoidosis is unknown. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that people with sarcoidosis develop less robust antibody and cell-mediated&#xD;
      immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than healthy individuals, both as a consequence of&#xD;
      the disease itself and due to treatment with immunosuppressive medications. This hypothesis&#xD;
      will be examined by determining levels of anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein immunoglobulin G&#xD;
      (IgG) antibody (Specific Aim 1) and measuring SARS-CoV-2-specific activation of peripheral&#xD;
      blood T cells (Specific Aim 2) following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in individuals with&#xD;
      sarcoidosis treated and not treated with immunosuppressive medications, in comparison to age-&#xD;
      and sex-matched healthy controls. For Specific Aim 1, a second-generation anti-SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      spike IgG assay calibrated against an independent virus neutralization assay will be&#xD;
      utilized. The results of this investigation will address a critical gap in the understanding&#xD;
      of vaccine responses in people with sarcoidosis. In addition, the study will contribute&#xD;
      knowledge needed to inform clinicians' recommendations to sarcoidosis patients regarding risk&#xD;
      of infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and will help lay the basis for future trials to&#xD;
      evaluate the possible benefit of vaccine boosters in individuals with poor immune responses&#xD;
      to initial vaccination.&#xD;

      Introduction, Hypothesis and Specific Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with sarcoidosis, particularly those with significant lung and/or cardiac involvement,&#xD;
      who become infected with SARS-CoV-2 are likely at increased risk of complications or death&#xD;
      from COVID-19. While SARS-CoV-2 vaccines are highly efficacious in preventing COVID-19 in the&#xD;
      general population, whether vaccination provides similar protection in people with&#xD;
      sarcoidosis is unknown. The investigators hypothesize that people with sarcoidosis develop&#xD;
      less robust antibody and cluster of differentiation 4 (CD4)+ T cell-mediated immune responses&#xD;
      to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination than healthy individuals, both as a consequence of the disease&#xD;
      itself and as a result of treatment with immunosuppressive medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Determine blood anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG antibody levels following&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in individuals with sarcoidosis treated and not treated with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications, in comparison to age- and sex-matched healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Determine levels of SARS-CoV-2-specific activation of peripheral blood CD4+ T&#xD;
      cells following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in individuals with sarcoidosis treated and not&#xD;
      treated with immunosuppressive medications, in comparison to age- and sex-matched healthy&#xD;
      controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this investigation will address a critical gap in the understanding of vaccine&#xD;
      responses in people with sarcoidosis. In addition, the study will contribute knowledge needed&#xD;
      to inform clinicians' recommendations to sarcoidosis patients regarding risk of infection&#xD;
      after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination, and will help lay the basis for future trials to evaluate the&#xD;
      possible benefit of vaccine boosters in individuals with poor immune responses to initial&#xD;
      vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of safe and effective vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 over the past year&#xD;
      represents a scientific triumph and public health breakthrough in the battle to control the&#xD;
      COVID-19 pandemic. Ongoing vaccination of the U.S. population has coincided with a &gt;12-fold&#xD;
      reduction in reported COVID-19 cases from a peak average of 260,000 per day in January 2021&#xD;
      to 21,000 per day as of this writing (May 29, 2021). Unfortunately, this has not been the&#xD;
      case in other parts of the world, particularly low and middle income countries of the Global&#xD;
      South, where vaccine availability has been severely limited and vaccination rates are so far&#xD;
      quite low. Although less than the inequality internationally, there are disparities in&#xD;
      vaccine access and uptake among groups within the U.S., with lower vaccination rates among&#xD;
      African Americans, Latin Americans and others. As a result, members of these groups remain at&#xD;
      increased risk, and will continue to sustain a disproportionate burden of COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another group at increased risk of developing COVID-19 is comprised of people with medical&#xD;
      conditions or on treatments that cause immune suppression, who therefore may fail to mount a&#xD;
      protective immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. For example, recent reports indicate&#xD;
      that antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines are suboptimal in&#xD;
      substantial proportions of solid organ transplant recipients and patients with hematologic&#xD;
      malignancies. Data on patients with connective tissue and other chronic inflammatory diseases&#xD;
      are mixed, with some recent studies showing robust antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccines,&#xD;
      even in those on immunosuppressive therapies, while another report found that antibody&#xD;
      responses in such individuals are reduced and/or delayed. Notably, in the latter study,&#xD;
      reduced antibody responses were associated the presence of an immune-mediated inflammatory&#xD;
      disease, but not more likely in those on specific immunosuppressive medications. In contrast,&#xD;
      another recent study found that use of methotrexate was associated with decreased antibody&#xD;
      and cluster of differentiation 8 (CD8)+ T cell responses to the SARS-CoV-2 BNT162b2 mRNA&#xD;
      vaccine, while other oral immunomodulatory drugs and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) inhibitors&#xD;
      did not appear to have such an effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Whether the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is impaired in people with sarcoidosis&#xD;
      is not known. This is a critical question because sarcoidosis patients may be at increased&#xD;
      risk for severe adverse outcomes of COVID-19. The literature on responses to other vaccines&#xD;
      in sarcoidosis is sparse. One study reported no difference in the antibody response to&#xD;
      influenza vaccination in untreated sarcoidosis patients compared to healthy controls. By&#xD;
      contrast, in another report, antibody responses to tetanus vaccination were reduced in&#xD;
      patients with sarcoidosis, 52% of whom were on oral corticosteroids, although the impairment&#xD;
      in vaccine response was unrelated to corticosteroid therapy. There are no published data on T&#xD;
      lymphocyte responses to vaccination in sarcoidosis, although the observation that CD4+ T cell&#xD;
      activation and proliferation are impaired in active sarcoidosis suggests that the T cell&#xD;
      response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination may be reduced as well. In the absence of better data&#xD;
      specific to the disease, a group of international experts recently put forward a strong&#xD;
      recommendation for SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in people with sarcoidosis, and extrapolating from&#xD;
      information on responses to other vaccines in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, proposed an&#xD;
      algorithm for adjustment of immunomodulatory medications around the time of vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lack of information on immune responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in sarcoidosis&#xD;
      indicates that studies to address this issue are urgently needed. The proposed investigation&#xD;
      will begin to fill this critical knowledge gap by assessing both antibody and T cell&#xD;
      responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination in individuals with sarcoidosis who are untreated and&#xD;
      others who are treated with immunomodulatory agents in comparison to healthy control&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan&#xD;
&#xD;
      General. Approval will be obtained from the Institutional Review Board of Northwestern&#xD;
      University. The study will be registered with clinicaltrials.gov prior to the study start&#xD;
      date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Participants. Three groups of female and male subjects, all of whom will have completed&#xD;
      primary vaccination, or primary vaccination plus booster vaccination, with one of the three&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccines currently authorized in the U.S. (BNT162b2 [Pfizer-BioNTech], mRNA-1273&#xD;
      [Moderna] or JNJ-78436735 [Johnson &amp; Johnson]) at least 2 weeks previously, will be studied:&#xD;
      1) individuals with sarcoidosis not treated with immunosuppressive medications; 2)&#xD;
      individuals with sarcoidosis treated with immunosuppressive medications, including systemic&#xD;
      corticosteroids, methotrexate, azathioprine, mycophenolate mofetil, leflunomide, and anti-TNF&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies; and 3) individuals without sarcoidosis, other immune-mediated&#xD;
      diseases, chronic lung disease, heart disease or malignancy, and not taking immunomodulatory&#xD;
      medications [healthy controls]. Sarcoidosis subjects treated and not treated with&#xD;
      immunosuppressive medications will recruited from established patients followed in the&#xD;
      Pulmonary and Cardiology Clinics of the Northwestern Medicine Sarcoidosis Program. Healthy&#xD;
      control subjects, matched for age and sex with the sarcoidosis subjects, will be recruited&#xD;
      from members of the Northwestern Medicine community and the community at large. Demographic&#xD;
      information, dates and type of SARS-CoV-2 vaccine received, and history of prior testing for&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 infection or symptomatic COVID-19 will be recorded for all subjects. For&#xD;
      sarcoidosis subjects, detailed information on method of sarcoidosis diagnosis, disease&#xD;
      duration, past and present medical therapy for sarcoidosis, other current medications,&#xD;
      co-morbid medical conditions, tobacco and other substance use, and occupation will be&#xD;
      recorded. For healthy controls, current medications, past medical history, tobacco and other&#xD;
      substance use, and occupation will likewise be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1. Venous blood will be obtained from all subjects, and serum will separated,&#xD;
      aliquoted and frozen for subsequent analysis. Serum anti-SARS-CoV-2 spike protein IgG will be&#xD;
      measured following SARS-CoV-2 vaccination of individuals with sarcoidosis treated and not&#xD;
      treated with immunosuppressive medications, and age- and sex-matched healthy controls using&#xD;
      the LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 TrimericS IgG assay (Diasorin). This is a highly sensitive and&#xD;
      specific second-generation assay for IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 trimeric spike protein&#xD;
      receptor binding domain. The assay has been calibrated against a separate SARS-CoV-2 virus&#xD;
      neutralization assay, with a receiver operating characteristic area under the curve for&#xD;
      detection of antibody with virus neutralization capacity of 0.996. The Diasorin TrimericS IgG&#xD;
      assay received Emergency Use Authorization from the FDA on May 19.2021, and will replace the&#xD;
      first-generation LIAISON SARS-CoV-2 S1/S2 IgG assay, which itself correlated most highly with&#xD;
      virus neutralization capacity among five commercial SARS-CoV-2 antibody assays in a recent&#xD;
      study. It should be noted that neutralizing antibody levels are highly predictive of immune&#xD;
      protection from symptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serum samples will be stored frozen at&#xD;
      -80°C and assayed as a batch when subject enrollment and sample acquisition are complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Power analysis: Extrapolating from data in a recent study of antibody responses to SARS-CoV2&#xD;
      vaccination in patients with rheumatic diseases on immunosuppressive therapies, the online&#xD;
      sample size calculator ClinCalc.com was used to determine that up to 80 subjects per group&#xD;
      will be required to detect a 20% reduction in average antibody level in either of the sarcoid&#xD;
      groups compared to healthy controls, with a power of 0.80 at alpha 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) will be isolated from&#xD;
      anticoagulated venous blood of 10 subjects in each of the two sarcoidosis groups and healthy&#xD;
      controls by Ficoll-Paque centrifugation, washed, resuspended in 10% dimethylsulfoxide/fetal&#xD;
      bovine serum and cryopreserved at -80°C. SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ T cell activation will be&#xD;
      assayed using PBMCs from sarcoidosis subjects treated and not treated with immunosuppressive&#xD;
      medications, and age- and sex-matched healthy controls using the interferon-γ EliSpotPLUS&#xD;
      assay (Mabtech). PBMCs will be stimulated with SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid protein&#xD;
      peptide pools (BEI Resources), or anti-cluster of differentiation 3 (CD3) antibody (Mabtech)&#xD;
      as positive control, as described (19). PBMCs will remain cryopreserved at -80°C, then&#xD;
      thawed, resuspended in culture medium, and assayed as a batch when subject enrollment and&#xD;
      sample acquisition are complete. Alternatively, the T cell response to vaccination will be&#xD;
      assessed in anticoagulated whole blood using the SARS-CoV-2 QuantiFERON assay (Qiagen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis. The significance of differences between group means will be determined&#xD;
      by Analysis of Variance and Dunnett's Multiple Comparison Test. P &lt; 0.05 will considered&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
