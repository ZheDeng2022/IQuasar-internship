  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The current COVID-19 epidemic has overwhelmed the health systems of many countries in which&#xD;
      it has broken out, forcing various governments to institute population containment measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Residents of medico-social institutions for the elderly are particularly at risk of&#xD;
      developing severe forms because they have a large number of factors favoring the progression&#xD;
      to a severe form (very advanced age, multiple comorbidities, dependence in activities of&#xD;
      dayli life).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specificity and positive predictive value of clinical signs are not very important in&#xD;
      this population; which makes the diagnosis even more complicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the strategies to try to protect these residents, in addition to room containment and&#xD;
      clinical surveillance, would be to carry out a systematic screening campaign of all residents&#xD;
      and all caregivers, then to consider reorganizing the establishments with a sector &quot;COVID +&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was announced by the French Minister of Health Olivier VERAN on 04/06/2020 from the&#xD;
      first confirmed case of COVID-19 in an institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, asymptomatic subjects may have a &quot;negative&quot; RT-PCR test at one point but which is&#xD;
      positive in the following days. And in this interval they would still be contagious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore not excluded that the implementation of such a screening campaign will not be&#xD;
      effective in reducing the number of new cases of COVID-19 in medico-social institutions for&#xD;
      the elderly&#xD;
