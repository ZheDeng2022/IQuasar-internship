      This is a multicenter, open-label, phase II study to evaluate the cardiac safety of&#xD;
      Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome in patients with advanced malignant tumor who has&#xD;
      received at least first-line treatment. About 120 patients will be recruited in this study.&#xD;
      Patients with solid tumors will receive Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m^2 by an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion (IV) every 3 weeks (q3w, 1 cycle). Patients with lymphoma will receive&#xD;
      Mitoxantrone Hydrochloride Liposome 20 mg/m^2 by an intravenous infusion (IV) every 4 weeks&#xD;
      (q4w, 1 cycle). All the patients will receive the treatment until disease progression,&#xD;
      intolerable toxic reaction, death, or withdrawal by investigator's or patient's decision.&#xD;
