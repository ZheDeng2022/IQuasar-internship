      The acute pneumonia pandemic caused by a new strain of corona virus 2019 named as COVID-19 by&#xD;
      the World Health Organization (WHO) is a pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus. The reported&#xD;
      symptoms have included, but are not limited to fever or chills, cough, shortness of breath,&#xD;
      muscle aches, headaches, loss of taste or smell, diarrhea, dizziness, sore throat, abdominal&#xD;
      pain, anorexia, and vomiting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The capsule KOVIR is a product based on the traditional prescription which is used to treat&#xD;
      the cold conditions, also known as the initial plague according to the theory of traditional&#xD;
      medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study timeline is expected from July 2021 to December 2022, including enrolment period,&#xD;
      14 days of treatment, data entry and analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study compares between standard dose regimen of KOVIR combined with background treatment&#xD;
      in COVID-19 patients and placebo combined with background treatment in COVID-19 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be treated and followed up in 14-day period. In case the participant&#xD;
      meets the discharge criteria before 14 days, discontinuing the study drug will be done at the&#xD;
      discretion of the investigators.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening procedures occur at Day 1. Periodic assessments are conducted daily from Day 2-14.&#xD;
      Finally, End of study visit is conducted.&#xD;
