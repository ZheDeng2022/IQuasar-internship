  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the gametocytocidal and transmission reducing&#xD;
      activity of artemether-lumefantrine (AL) with and without a single dose of 0.25mg/kg&#xD;
      primaquine (PQ) and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine with amodiaquine (SPAQ) with and without single&#xD;
      dose of 1.66mg/kg tafenoquine (TQ). Outcome measures will include infectivity to mosquitoes&#xD;
      at 2, 5 and 7 days after treatment, gametocyte density throughout follow-up, and safety&#xD;
      measures including haemoglobin density and the frequency of adverse events.&#xD;
