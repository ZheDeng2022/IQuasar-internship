      The Placebo-Controlled Efficacy in Idiopathic Normal Pressure Hydrocephalus (iNPH) Shunting&#xD;
      (PENS) trial is a multi-center blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled design investigation&#xD;
      of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) shunt surgery to study the shunt efficacy in iNPH patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary intervention will be setting the FDA-approved Certas Plus with Siphonguard,&#xD;
      programmable CSF shunt valve to active (open shunt group)(setting 4)(110 mm H2O) or placebo&#xD;
      (closed shunt group)(setting 8)(&gt;400 mm H2O)in a 1:1 ratio. By the time of the primary&#xD;
      objective evaluation at three months, the closed shunt group will have zero months of active&#xD;
      treatment, and the open shunt group will have three months of active treatment. At three&#xD;
      months, shunts for subjects in the closed shunt group will be adjusted to setting 4. To&#xD;
      maintain blinding, all patients will be adjusted / mock adjusted to the active setting in a&#xD;
      similar fashion. Patients from both groups will not be adjusted before three months of active&#xD;
      treatment, unless judged medically necessary by the treating team. Following the three month&#xD;
      visit, all subjects in each group will have shunt adjustments according to clinical standards&#xD;
      at each center.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The primary intervention will be the initiation of the randomized initial shunt valve opening pressure setting to create a delayed treatment group in half of the study patients.&#xD;
Randomization will be to active or placebo (closed) shunt settings. At the time of the standard three-month evaluation, all subjects will be similarly non-invasively adjusted to bring all subjects in both groups to the active setting while maintaining blinding of the subjects. All settings will be verified by the adjusting neurosurgeon.</intervention_model_description>
