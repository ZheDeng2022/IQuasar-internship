  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of this pilot project is to measure the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      randomized crossover study examining short-term changes in atrial fibrillation (AF) symptoms&#xD;
      in symptomatic females and males with persistent AF when they engage in a standard week of&#xD;
      exercise (i.e. moderate-intensity continuous training [MICT] or high-intensity interval&#xD;
      training [HIIT]) compared to a control week (i.e. no moderate to vigorous exercise over 7&#xD;
      days).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Exercise training (e.g. 8 to 12-week exercise programs) has been shown to improve&#xD;
      cardiorespiratory fitness and QoL, and reduce atrial fibrillation (AF) symptoms and time in&#xD;
      AF in patients with AF. However, regular exercise participation is hindered by patient&#xD;
      concerns regarding an increase in AF symptoms and episodes during or following an exercise&#xD;
      session. Patients with AF also worry about potential negative consequences of increasing&#xD;
      heart rate during exercise. This fear may be sex-specific as females report more AF symptoms&#xD;
      at rest, experience faster heart rates during exercise and AF, and report greater symptoms of&#xD;
      fear/anxiety than males. How exercise acutely changes AF symptoms remains to be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this pilot project is to measure the feasibility of conducting a&#xD;
      randomized crossover study examining short-term changes in AF symptoms in symptomatic females&#xD;
      and males with persistent AF when they engage in a standard week of exercise (i.e.&#xD;
      moderate-intensity continuous training [MICT] or high-intensity interval training [HIIT])&#xD;
      compared to a control week (i.e. no moderate to vigorous exercise over 7 days). As secondary&#xD;
      outcomes we will explore sex differences in short-term changes in AF symptoms (self reported&#xD;
      with a questionnaire) and AF status (device measured with a wireless four-finger AliveCor&#xD;
      KardiaMobile ECG) when symptomatic patients with persistent AF engage in a standard week of&#xD;
      exercise (i.e. HIIT, MICT) compared to a control week. Results from this pilot study will&#xD;
      provide novel insight into the typical acute response to exercise in females and males with&#xD;
      AF, and will inform appropriate approaches for the conduct of a future larger trial. This&#xD;
      work is key to informing practitioners and patients of the typical acute exercise response in&#xD;
      the AF population with the goal of facilitating exercise prescription and participation.&#xD;

AF status will be measured with a Kardiamobile AliveCor wireless device. Participants will be asked to record 3 x 30-second ECGs a day (morning, afternoon, evening) during each condition (MICT, HIIT and rest). The ECG recording will allow the identification of whether the participant is in sinus rhythm or in atrial fibrillation.</description>
