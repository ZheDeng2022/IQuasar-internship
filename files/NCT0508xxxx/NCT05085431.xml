      A Study of CD19/BCMA Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cells Therapy for Patients With Refractory&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Autoimmune diseases only show local pathological damage, but more often systemic lesions. If&#xD;
      not diagnosed and treated in time or poorly controlled, a risk of disability or even death as&#xD;
      the course of the disease progresses. Studies have shown that B cells can present their own&#xD;
      antigens to autoimmune T cells to promote the release of inflammatory factors, or they can&#xD;
      differentiate into plasma cells to release autoantibodies, and play an important role in the&#xD;
      occurrence and progression of autoimmune diseases. In recent years, it has become a major&#xD;
      research focus to deplete B cells in patients or inhibit B cell function. This research&#xD;
      focuses on CAR-T cells killing B cells. Sjögren's syndrome (SS) is a systemic autoimmune&#xD;
      disease characterized by chronic inflammation of salivary and lachrymal glands, frequently&#xD;
      accompanied by systemic symptoms. The presence of various autoantibodies such as rheumatoid&#xD;
      factor (RF) and anti-SSA/SSB antibodies, as well as hypergammaglobulinemia, reflect B cell&#xD;
      hyperactivity. About five percent of patients with SS develop malignant B cell lymphoma,&#xD;
      usually of the mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) type and most frequently located in&#xD;
      the major salivary glands. This fully reflects the application prospects of CAR-T cells in&#xD;
      autoimmune diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the current research progress, our center intends to conduct research on the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of CD19/BCMA CAR-T cells in the treatment of refractory systemic lupus&#xD;
      erythematosus.&#xD;
