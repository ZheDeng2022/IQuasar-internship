      This study was designed to investigate the correlation of lung cancer tissue expression of&#xD;
      both PDL-1-mRNA ,vitamin D receptor (VDR) and level of vit.D in sera of lung cancer&#xD;
      patients.These three biochemical markers may interact and play a role in lung cancer&#xD;
      progression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death worldwide. In 2018, it represented 11.6% of&#xD;
      total cancer cases and 18.4% of total cancer deaths, making it the most frequent cancer and&#xD;
      cause of cancer death in men and women combined .In Egypt, Lung cancer represents the most&#xD;
      lethal malignancy and the fourth most common cancer in men.It is relatively more common in&#xD;
      men. This gender difference in incidence is mainly due to differences in tobacco smoking&#xD;
      rates, as smoking represents the major risk factor of this disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Programmed cell death 1 (PD-1) (Entrez Gene: 29126) and its ligand, programmed cell death&#xD;
      ligand-1 (PDL-1) are new members of the CD28/B7 stimulatory superfamily. They mediate a&#xD;
      negative signal, which inhibits functioning and proliferation of T and B cells, and reduce&#xD;
      interleukin-2(IL-2), IL-10, and interferon-γ secretions.This inhibitory pathway is closely&#xD;
      related to tumor progression, it provides an immune escape for tumor cells through cytotoxic&#xD;
      T-cell inactivation. It plays an important role in the microenvironment of the tumor&#xD;
      progress.Expression of this gene in tumor cells is prognostic in many types of human&#xD;
      malignancies.Interaction of this ligand with its receptor inhibits T-cell activation and&#xD;
      cytokine production. During infection or inflammation of normal tissue, this interaction is&#xD;
      important for preventing autoimmunity by maintaining homeostasis of the immune response with&#xD;
      local immune tolerance to tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biologically active form of Vit D, namely calcitriol or 1,25-dihydroxy Vitamin D&#xD;
      (1,25(OH)2D ), is generated when 25(OH)D is hydroxylated in the kidneys by the cytochrome&#xD;
      1-α- hydroxylase enzyme (CYP27B1) (RXR) Yet, Vit. D has controversial effects; it has been&#xD;
      shown to induce apoptosis of cancer cells and likely to play a promising role in cancer&#xD;
      therapy.Numerous studies have proposed a strong relationship between low serum Vit. D levels&#xD;
      and increased risk of cancer, especially by the strongest evidence in breast and colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biological actions as anti-cancer effects of calcitriol are mostly exerted through&#xD;
      genomic actions mediated by the VDR and its existence in the numerous tumor tissues is&#xD;
      suggestive of its role in tumor genesis.The VDR is a member of the nuclear receptor/steroid&#xD;
      hormone receptor superfamily. These receptors function as ligand-activated, transcriptional&#xD;
      regulatory proteins.VDR/RXR complex translocates into the nucleus and induces the&#xD;
      transcription of phosphoinositide phospholipase C-γ1 (PLC-γ1) through interaction with Vit.D&#xD;
      responsive element (VDRE) on specific genes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an up-regulation of VDR upon exposure to Vit.D. The anti-proliferative and pro&#xD;
      differentiating effects of Vit.D are mostly mediated through the nuclear VDR.In many types of&#xD;
      cancers, decreased VDR expression has been found in advanced neoplasms.It was demonstrated a&#xD;
      differential expression of VDR (nuclear/cytoplasm) in progression of normal to invasive&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we aimed to detect tissue PDL-1, VDR expression levels and serum Vit.D levels&#xD;
      as biomarkers for the early detection of LC, investigating the correlations between these&#xD;
      biochemical indices and the clinicopathological features, and different risk factors in lung&#xD;
      cancer patients.&#xD;
