  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Open gynecologic surgery can be very painful. With the goal of minimizing the use of opioids&#xD;
      (with undesired side effects and potential for abuse), the investigators often administer a&#xD;
      type of peripheral nerve block in which the investigators put local anesthetic-or, numbing&#xD;
      medicine-near the nerves that go to the surgical area which helps to numb the area and&#xD;
      decrease pain following surgery. These blocks with a single-injection of local anesthetic are&#xD;
      called erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks, and they are applied on each side of the body since&#xD;
      each injection affects only that one side. However, the numbing medication typically lasts&#xD;
      for only 16-20 hours. For other peripheral nerve blocks, this duration can be increased with&#xD;
      the insertion of a catheter-a tiny tube smaller than a piece of spaghetti-followed by an&#xD;
      infusion of additional local anesthetic. However, the effects of the various peripheral nerve&#xD;
      blocks are determined by the anatomy and physiology of the specific peripheral nerve, with an&#xD;
      infusion resulting in dramatic benefits for one nerve yet having no effect for another. The&#xD;
      potential benefits and risks of adding a catheter and subsequent local anesthetic infusion to&#xD;
      a single-injection ESP block remain unknown. The investigatorstherefore propose a randomized,&#xD;
      triple-masked, placebo-controlled, split-body clinical trial to determine the potential&#xD;
      benefits and risks of adding the infusion to single-injection ESP blocks.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Open gynecologic surgery can be significantly painful. With the goal of minimizing the use of&#xD;
      opioids (with undesired side effects and potential for abuse), the investigators frequently&#xD;
      administer bilateral single-injection erector spinae plane (ESP) blocks which help to numb&#xD;
      the surgical area and decrease postoperative pain. However, the numbing medication typically&#xD;
      lasts for only 8-18 hours. For other peripheral nerve blocks, this duration can be increased&#xD;
      with the insertion of a percutaneous catheter-a tiny tube smaller than a piece of&#xD;
      spaghetti-followed by an infusion of additional local anesthetic. However, the effects of the&#xD;
      various peripheral nerve blocks are determined by the anatomy and physiology of the specific&#xD;
      peripheral nerve, with an infusion resulting in dramatic benefits for one nerve yet having no&#xD;
      effect for another. The potential benefits and risks of adding a catheter and subsequent&#xD;
      local anesthetic infusion to a single-injection ESP block remain unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore propose a randomized, triple-masked, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      split-body clinical trial to determine the potential benefits and risks of adding the&#xD;
      infusion to single-injection ESP blocks. Patients undergoing gynecologic surgery via a low&#xD;
      transverse (Pfannenstiel) incision who already have bilateral ESP blocks as part of their&#xD;
      analgesic plan will be offered enrollment. Participants will have bilateral catheters&#xD;
      inserted through the same block needles used for their single-injections, followed by&#xD;
      perineural administration of bupivacaine on one side and normal saline on the other&#xD;
      (determined randomly and in a triple-masked fashion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be a single-center, randomized, triple-masked, placebo-controlled, split-body human&#xD;
      subjects clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment. Participants will be consenting adults undergoing open gynecologic surgery via a&#xD;
      low transverse incision. Study inclusion will be proposed to eligible patients prior to&#xD;
      surgery. If a patient desires study participation, written, informed consent will be obtained&#xD;
      using a current Institutional Review Board-approved informed consent form. The study&#xD;
      population of interest includes women of all races and socioeconomic status. Inclusion and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria are listed in section #10 below. Of note, the investigators will be using&#xD;
      local anesthetic, perineural catheters, and infusion pumps as approved/cleared by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration and do not plan to research a possible change of indication or use of&#xD;
      these medications/devices as part of this research project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative Procedures. Following written, informed consent, the investigators will record&#xD;
      baseline anthropometric information (age, sex, height, and weight) that is already provided&#xD;
      by all patients having surgery. Participants will have a peripheral intravenous catheter&#xD;
      inserted, standard noninvasive monitors applied, supplemental oxygen administered via a nasal&#xD;
      cannula or face mask, and positioned sitting. Intravenous midazolam and fentanyl will be&#xD;
      titrated for patient comfort, while ensuring that patients remain responsive to verbal cues.&#xD;
      The area of insertion will be sterily prepared and a clear, sterile, fenestrated drape&#xD;
      applied. In the sitting position and with ultrasound guidance, after subcutaneous local&#xD;
      infiltration with lidocaine- a 17g Tuohy and 5-10 ml of saline with 1:200,000 epinephrine&#xD;
      will be used to identify the correct plane, as defined by a hyperechoic shadow of the 10th&#xD;
      transverse process and erector spine muscle immediately superficial. Once appropriate needle&#xD;
      tip location is confirmed, a perineural catheter will be inserted under ultrasound guidance.&#xD;
      This procedure will be repeated on the contralateral side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following negative aspiration, 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine with 1:200,000 of epinephrine will&#xD;
      be injected via both catheters with sonographic confirmation of local anesthetic spread.&#xD;
      Blocks will be considered successful if, within 30 minutes, the participant experiences&#xD;
      decreased sensation to cold temperature over the level of the ipsilateral 10th thoracic&#xD;
      dermatome at the level of anterior axillary line. Failed blocks/catheters will be&#xD;
      successfully replaced or the participant withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Group Assignment. The right-sided catheter will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      treatment groups: bupivacaine 0.25% or normal saline (&quot;study infusate&quot;). The contralateral&#xD;
      side will receive the other possible study infusate (either bupivacaine 0.25% or normal&#xD;
      saline). Therefore, each participant will receive both treatments-one on each side-and act as&#xD;
      their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified for benign vs. malignant surgical indication, in block sizes&#xD;
      of 4. The randomization list will be created by the University of California San Diego&#xD;
      Investigational Drug Service. Investigational pharmacists will prepare all study solutions as&#xD;
      determined by the randomization list. Bupivacaine and normal saline are indistinguishable in&#xD;
      appearance, and therefore investigators, participants, and all clinical staff will be masked&#xD;
      to treatment group assignment for the duration of the enrollment and data collection period.&#xD;
      Unmasking will not occur until statistical analysis is complete (termed &quot;triple masking&quot;).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study intervention. Perineural study infusate administration will be initiated within the&#xD;
      operating or recovery rooms. Both infusion pumps will be programmed to deliver a basal&#xD;
      infusion of 1 mL/h and an automatic intermittent bolus of 20 mL every 4 hours. This dose of&#xD;
      bupivacaine is well-within the standard maximum dose at our institution for perineural local&#xD;
      anesthetic administration for other truncal locations such as the paravertebral space. No&#xD;
      patient-controlled bolus dose will be included. For any cases of inadvertent premature&#xD;
      catheter dislodgement, the subject may opt to have the catheter replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perineural catheters will be removed by healthcare providers upon study infusate reservoir&#xD;
      exhaustion (approximately 50 hours) or just prior to hospital discharge-whichever comes&#xD;
      first.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative analgesics. In addition to the perineural study infusate, subjects will receive&#xD;
      standard-of-care oral and intravenous postoperative analgesics which can include&#xD;
      acetaminophen, ibuprofen, gabapentin, and opioids (this is surgeon- and patient-dependent).&#xD;
      Therefore, all patients of this study-regardless of the treatment arm they are randomized&#xD;
      to-will continue to receive current usual and customary analgesia: all will receive the same&#xD;
      combination of acetaminophen, ibuprofen, gabapentin, opioids, and a single-injection erector&#xD;
      spinae plane block as they would regardless of study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements (end points). The investigators have selected outcome measures that have&#xD;
      established reliability and validity, with minimal inter-rater discordance, and are&#xD;
      recommended for pain-related clinical trials by the World Health Organization and the&#xD;
      Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT)&#xD;
      consensus statement. All data collection will be through standard UCSD nursing/therapy EPIC&#xD;
      notes and patient interviews in-person during hospitalization or via a telephone call. All&#xD;
      pain scores will be recorded for each side of the body (trunk) at each time point, measured&#xD;
      using the Numeric Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of the proposed research is to determine the risks and benefits of&#xD;
      adding a continuous erector spinae plane (ESP) block to a single-injection ESP in patients&#xD;
      undergoing open gynecologic surgery via a low transverse incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To determine the risks and benefits of adding a continuous ESP block to a&#xD;
      single-injection ESP the day following open gynecologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.1: Analgesia will be improved the day following surgery with the addition of a&#xD;
      continuous ESP block as measured with the Numeric Rating Scale (&quot;average&quot; pain included in&#xD;
      the Brief Pain Inventory pain domain) [primary end point].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.2: Breakthrough pain will be decreased the day following surgery with the&#xD;
      addition of a continuous ESP block as measured with the Numeric Rating Scale (&quot;worst&quot; pain&#xD;
      included in the Brief Pain Inventory pain domain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1.3: Pain during coughing will be decreased the day following surgery with the&#xD;
      addition of a continuous ESP block as measured with the Numeric Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To determine the risks and benefits on postoperative day 2 of adding a&#xD;
      continuous ESP block to a single-injection ESP following open gynecologic surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.1: Analgesia will be improved on postoperative day 2 with the addition of a&#xD;
      continuous ESP block as measured with the Numeric Rating Scale (&quot;average&quot; pain included in&#xD;
      the Brief Pain Inventory pain domain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.2: Breakthrough pain will be decreased on postoperative day 2 with the addition&#xD;
      of a continuous ESP block as measured with the Numeric Rating Scale (&quot;worst&quot; pain included in&#xD;
      the Brief Pain Inventory pain domain).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2.3: Pain during coughing will be decreased on postoperative day 2 with the&#xD;
      addition of a continuous ESP block as measured with the Numeric Rating Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis Approach Baseline characteristics by randomized side (bupivacaine to the left vs&#xD;
      bupivacaine to the right) will be summarized with means, standard deviations, and quartiles.&#xD;
      Balance between groups will be assessed. Specifically, standardized differences will be&#xD;
      calculated using Cohen's d whereby the difference in means or proportions is divided by the&#xD;
      pooled standard deviation estimates. Any key variables (age, sex, height, weight, and BMI)&#xD;
      with an absolute standardized difference &gt;0.78 (with 1.96×√(2/12.5)=0.78 [with a sample size&#xD;
      of 25, the investigators expect about 12.5 randomized to left vs right]) will be noted and&#xD;
      included in a linear regression model to obtain an estimate of the treatment effect adjusted&#xD;
      for the imbalanced covariate(s). If residuals from the linear regression indicate violations&#xD;
      of key assumptions (i.e. homoscedasticity or Gaussian distribution), data transformations&#xD;
      and/or alternative generalized linear models will be applied as appropriate. If no imbalance&#xD;
      is detected, the primary analysis will proceed by a one-sample Wilcoxon test applied to the&#xD;
      difference between paired observations (bupivacaine minus saline). Secondary outcomes will&#xD;
      also be analyzed by one-sample Wilcoxon test, or linear models (or generalized linear models)&#xD;
      as appropriate to adjust for any imbalanced covariates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will exclude patients from the analysis if their low transverse incision&#xD;
      is unexpectedly converted to a vertical incision following randomization. The investigators&#xD;
      will compare the characteristics of these excluded participants compared to the primary&#xD;
      analysis population, and also report results for the full intention-to-treat population (all&#xD;
      randomized participants).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gatekeeping strategy Hypotheses will be tested with strong control of the familywise error&#xD;
      rate at 5%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing begins with a single primary hypotheses H11. If this test is significant at the 0.05&#xD;
      level, that alpha is passed on to other hypotheses. For example, if the p-value for H12 is&#xD;
      less than 0.025, but the p-value for H13 is not, then H13 can be tested at the 0.025 +&#xD;
      0.025/2 = 0.0375 level. If both H12 and H13 are rejected, no alpha is spent, and the&#xD;
      investigators go on to similarly test H21, H22, and H23. If a given test does not reach local&#xD;
      significance, alpha is spent and cannot be passed along to hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulated Power for NRS Power is estimated by simulations assuming a minimum clinically&#xD;
      meaningful effect: NRS difference scores (bupivacaine minus saline, with negative scores&#xD;
      favoring bupivacaine) are distributed with a median of -1 and interquartile range (IQR) -3 to&#xD;
      0. This IQR for a bilateral difference is consistent with unilateral IQRs (6 to 6 and 7 to 7)&#xD;
      reported in Boules et al. (2020). A sample size of n=25 individuals would provide 84% power&#xD;
      to detect such an effect with two-sided α=0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along with cancelled surgeries and drop-out cases, the investigators anticipate requiring the&#xD;
      consenting of 35 subjects to produce a data set consisting of a minimum of 25 subjects to be&#xD;
      included in the final analysis.&#xD;

    <description>This is a split body study. Bilateral erector spinae plane catheters will be inserted and study fluid is administered bilaterally. Bupivacaine 0.25 will be administered through the right-sided catheter while normal saline will be administered through the left-sided catheter. Both infusion pumps will be programmed to deliver a basal infusion of 1 mL/h and an automatic intermittent bolus of 20 mL every 4 hours.</description>
