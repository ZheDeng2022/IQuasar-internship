  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was planned to determine the effect of acupressure on pain, anxiety and vital signs&#xD;
      of patients with coronary angiography. Acupressure application was carried out by the&#xD;
      responsible researcher, who is certified on this subject, by TRNC Dr. In the Cardiology&#xD;
      Service of Burhan NalbantoÄŸlu Hospital, patients who have undergone angiography will be&#xD;
      applied and measurements will be made before mobilization after their informed consent is&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;

      In this study, it is aimed to raise awareness for the use of painless, painless, economical,&#xD;
      side-effect-free and easy-to-apply acupressure in nursing care in order to increase patient&#xD;
      comfort by relieving pain and anxiety of patients during mandatory bed rest after coronary&#xD;
      angiography. In addition, our study is important in terms of providing new information with a&#xD;
      high level of evidence and providing a source for other studies on this subject.&#xD;
&#xD;

      and the control group in terms of Respiration Rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 7 H0: There is no difference in Cortisol Level between the acupressure group, the&#xD;
      sham (false acupressure) group and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is a difference between the acupressure group, the sham (false acupressure) group&#xD;
      and the control group in terms of Cortisol Level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Personal Information Form, &quot;Spielberger State Anxiety Scale&quot;, &quot;Visual Analogue Scale&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;Vital Signs Follow-up Form&quot; will be administered to all patients (acupressure, sham&#xD;
      acupressure and control groups) included in the study (1. &quot;Spielberger State Anxiety&#xD;
      Inventory&quot;, &quot;After the measurement, half an hour after applying acupressure to the points&#xD;
      determined for both groups (2nd measurement), two hours later (3rd measurement) and just&#xD;
      before mobilization (4th measurement),&quot; &quot;Visual Analogue Scale&quot; and &quot;Vital Signs Follow-up&#xD;
      Form&quot; will be applied again.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It was created by the researcher to track the cortisol level. It is designed to include a&#xD;
      total of 2 measurements (pre/post acupressure).&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Since the patients who will be included in the study are not known in advance, the patients will be randomized by the statistician using GraphPad software 3 and the block randomization technique, in order to assign the same number of participants to each group before the study, and will be divided into groups A, B, and C.</intervention_model_description>
    <primary_purpose>Supportive Care</primary_purpose>
    <masking>Single (Participant)</masking>
    <masking_description>As a result of the draw, group A was determined as acupressure, group B as sham acupressure and group C as the control group. Since pressure will be applied to the pressure points of the patients in the acupressure and sham group included in the study, the sham (placebo) acupressure and acupressure groups will be blinded, since the patients do not know whether acupressure or sham acupressure is applied. The control group and the researcher cannot be blinded due to the nature of the research.</masking_description>

    <description>The scale consists of 20 statements. The total score can range from 20 to 80. A high score indicates a high level of anxiety, and a low score indicates a low level of anxiety.</description>

    <description>Applicable to the acupressure group; Heart meridian 7th point (HT7), large intestine meridian 4th point (LI4) and pericardium 6th point (PC6), a total of three points will be applied. Afterwards, sequential (breathing rhythm) compressions will be applied to the determined acupressure points by the researcher without lifting the finger, taking into account the pain threshold of the individual who is applied with the thumb, with 10 seconds of pressure for two seconds of relief. Since the symmetry of the selected three different points on the other extremity will also be applied, a total of 12 minutes of compression will be applied to each point, provided that it is two minutes. Depending on the preparation and compression time on each point, the session duration of each patient will be approximately 16 minutes.</description>

    <description>n the acupressure application to the Sham group, pressure will be exerted on the bone region where the meridians do not pass, parallel to the HT7, LI4, PC6 and points (approximately 1-1.5 cm away) (Figure 4). Before the application, the acupressure points will be heated for about 20 seconds and the tissue sensitivity will be reduced by rubbing and they will be made ready for the acupressure application. Afterwards, the acupressure points determined will be pressed with the thumb by the researcher with a lower intensity than the normal application pressure for two minutes. Similar to the acupressure group, the sham group will be applied to symmetrical points. In this direction, a session will last 16 minutes for each patient, as in the acupressure group, together with the duration of the pre-procedure preparation and applications.</description>
