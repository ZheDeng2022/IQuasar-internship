  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to compare the efficacy and participant experience of telehealth-based,&#xD;
      self-collected cervical cancer screening to mail-based, self-collected cervical cancer&#xD;
      screening across the adult female screening lifespan. This will be done by evaluating&#xD;
      sufficient Human papillomavirus (HPV) sample collection and determining preference for&#xD;
      self-collection verses provider collection, comparing role of telehealth in pre- and post-&#xD;
      menopausal women's comfort with self-collection, comparing self-collection completion rates&#xD;
      for women with and without telehealth visits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be a prospective, randomized study of women ages 25 and older, stratified by&#xD;
      menopausal status (defined as 12 months or greater without menses or time at which both&#xD;
      ovaries have been surgically removed), who are eligible for cervical cancer screening.&#xD;
