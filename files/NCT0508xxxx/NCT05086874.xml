  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a retrospective, multi-center, real-world study. The researchers plan to include&#xD;
      10,000 cases of ischemic stroke patients using butylphthalide and 10,000 cases of ischemic&#xD;
      stroke patients using Urinary Kallidinogenase. The main purpose is to analyze the&#xD;
      effectiveness and safety of butylphthalide and establish the drug risk assessment management&#xD;
      plan.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke is a type of syndrome in which blood supply to the brain is impaired due to&#xD;
      various reasons, leading to local brain tissue ischemia, hypoxic necrosis, and corresponding&#xD;
      neurological deficits. It has a high incidence, high morbidity and disability. Features of&#xD;
      high recurrence rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Butylphthalide can improve the damage of central nervous system in patients with acute&#xD;
      ischemic stroke, and can promote the improvement of patients with neurological deficits.&#xD;
      Regarding butylphthalide in the treatment of ischemic stroke, there is still a lack of big&#xD;
      data research based on the efficacy and safety of the real world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, it is planned to include 10,000 patients who used butylphthalide or Urinary&#xD;
      Kallidinogenase in five hospitals from 2019 to 2021, and record the basic information of the&#xD;
      patients, medication status and related test results. The data was cleaned, sorted and&#xD;
      analyzed to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of butylphthalide in the treatment of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke.&#xD;

    <description>NIH stroke scale (NIHSS) to assess the degree of neurological deficit in stroke patients. The score ranges from 0 to 42 points, the higher the score, the more severe the nerve damage. Patients with a baseline assessment of&gt; 16 points are likely to die, while those with a score of &lt;6 are likely to recover well; for each additional point, the probability of a good prognosis is reduced by 17%</description>

    <description>Modified Rankin scale (mRS) is an indicator of the efficacy of functional disability. The score ranges from 0 to 5 points, and the clinical score will be increased to 6 points to indicate death. The higher the score, the more disability the patient is.</description>
