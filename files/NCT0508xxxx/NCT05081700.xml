  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot study will establish a proof of concept for using a systems biology approach to&#xD;
      characterize the dynamics of MS disease processes. The primary objective of the study is to&#xD;
      identify multi-omic (genetic, proteomic, biochemical and/or microbial) factors that correlate&#xD;
      with clinical and subclinical MS disease activity. Identification of such biomarkers could&#xD;
      have an immediate clinical utility in identification of MS patients prone to more aggressive&#xD;
      disease earlier in their disease course, thus affording the opportunity to better&#xD;
      individualize therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, insights from better understanding of the complex interplay of various systems&#xD;
      biology factors should improve our understanding of MS in general. The study will recruit 50&#xD;
      patients with relapsing MS who are initiating treatment with ocrelizumab, and follow them for&#xD;
      15 months, with an optional extension phase up to 24 months, using a suite of clinical,&#xD;
      para-clinical and biological assessments. After 75% of the patients have completed 12 months,&#xD;
      analysis will be conducted and reported to Roche/Genentech, to determine whether to pursue&#xD;
      the extension phase.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main purpose of the study is to improve the understanding of MS and to look at the&#xD;
      genetic factors that may influence how MS progresses. This will involve collecting blood and&#xD;
      stool samples, patient questionnaires, and MS-related assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 67 mL (13 tsp) of blood will be collected at the first visit, and then again 1 year&#xD;
      later. An additional 13 mL (2.5 tsp) sample is collected at Visit 3 and Visit 5.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive standard treatment (ocrelizumab) and have standard exams, MRIs, and&#xD;
      tests while on the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participation is about 15 months, which includes about 9 study visits. Some study&#xD;
      visits may be up to 5 hours long. There may be an optional 'extension phase' of the trial to&#xD;
      18-24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      50 people will take part in this study.&#xD;
