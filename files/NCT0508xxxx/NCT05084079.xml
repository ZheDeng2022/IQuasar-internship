  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes has become one of the major chronic non-communicable diseases. Its prevalence was&#xD;
      rising in these years. Short-term intensive insulin therapy can improve the β-cell function&#xD;
      and nearly half of the patients can live with long-term glycemic remission. It has therefore&#xD;
      become the recommended treatment for the newly diagnosis T2DM patients with high blood&#xD;
      glucose. However, due to the glycemic goal for intensive therapy is strict, it's important to&#xD;
      find out a suitable initial insulin regimen for continuous subcutaneous insulin&#xD;
      infusion(CSII) with which patients can achieve euglycemia safely, stably and rapidly. In&#xD;
      previous study, the investigators found out that the total daily insulin dose at the first&#xD;
      day when euglycemia was achieved（TDD-1） was associated with weight, waist circumference,&#xD;
      triglycerides and fasting blood glucose levels. According to this, the investigators figured&#xD;
      out a formula for estimation of insulin dose for the short-term intensive insulin therapy in&#xD;
      patients with newly diagnosed T2DM. However, its feasibility needs to be further verified.&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators conducted this prospective randomized controlled study to&#xD;
      compare the effects of different initial insulin dose regimens during the short-term insulin&#xD;
      intensive treatment on time to glycemic goal, hypoglycemia prevalence, glycemic variability&#xD;
      and other safety problems in newly diagnosed type 2 diabetes patients, in order to&#xD;
      investigate the rational of formula based initiation regimen.&#xD;
