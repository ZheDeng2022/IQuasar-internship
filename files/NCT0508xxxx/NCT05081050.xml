      The aim of the present project is to evaluate functional, biological and technical variables,&#xD;
      as well as quality of life and satisfaction as indicators of long-term clinical performance&#xD;
      of single prostheses on short implants in the posterior region with a 10-year prospective&#xD;
      follow-up. This proposal refers to a clinical research project with a 10-year follow-up of&#xD;
      single crowns on short implants (6 mm) in the posterior region of the maxilla and mandible.&#xD;
      The cohort has started in 2010 through a project funded by the International Team for&#xD;
      Implantology. The main clinical results with a 4-year follow-up showed the influence of&#xD;
      biomechanical factors (implant/crown ratio) on short-term treatment success and increased&#xD;
      risk over time. The sample will consist of participants from the cohort of the research&#xD;
      project established in 2010, who received a single crown on a short implant (6-mm Standard&#xD;
      Plus Wide Neck SLA) in the posterior region of the maxilla or mandible according to&#xD;
      eligibility criteria and standardized clinical procedures. Data will be collected by clinical&#xD;
      and image exams, questionnaires (for sleep bruxism, satisfaction and quality of life),&#xD;
      recording of maximum occlusal force, measurement of perimplant bone changes, and calculation&#xD;
      of the clinical crown-implant ratio. Data will be analyzed by descriptive and inferential&#xD;
      statistics with survival analysis and multivariable models, if assumptions are met, at the&#xD;
      significance level of 0.05.&#xD;

      AIMS&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the clinical performance of single crowns on short (6-mm) implants in the&#xD;
      posterior region of the maxilla and mandible, according to functional, biological and&#xD;
      technical variables, as well as patient satisfaction and quality of life as indicators of&#xD;
      clinical success after ten years of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aims: This study will&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Measure the long-term success and survival rates of short implants (6-mm) and single&#xD;
           crowns in the posterior region, through a 10-year prospective follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Identify risk factors for failure and complication of short implant and single crowns.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Compare the general satisfaction and quality of life of patients with and without&#xD;
           failures/complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and sample&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study design is characterized as a cohort, prospective, observational study, as a&#xD;
      continuation of the original clinical project established in 2010 (ITI Small Grant 688_2010:&#xD;
      'Risk Factors on the Prognosis of Single Short Implants in the Posterior Region - A&#xD;
      Prospective Clinical Study'). The description and results of the 2010-cohort project have&#xD;
      been published previously. The present protocol was approved by the University Institutional&#xD;
      Review Board and registered in the Brazilian Ministry of Health registry 'Plataforma Brasil'&#xD;
      (CAAE: 26192919.5.0000.5336). The study sample will consist of participants from the&#xD;
      2010-cohort, who were selected according to the eligibility criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 2010-cohort consisted of 20 patients who received 46 Standard Plus Wide Neck SLA&#xD;
      (Straumann Dental Implant System, Waldenburg, Switzerland) 6-mm implants and metal-ceramic&#xD;
      crowns cemented over SynOcta abutments (Straumann Dental Implant System, Waldenburg,&#xD;
      Switzerland) in a private practice setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be recalled for a 10-year follow-up research exam and will sign a new&#xD;
      informed consent form. Whenever possible the same instruments adopted in the first&#xD;
      2010-cohort study will be used for comparison purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data will be collected on current socio-demographic and anthropometric variables,&#xD;
      general health, oral conditions of hard and soft tissues, occlusal status, level of oral&#xD;
      hygiene, gingival probing, and presence of any problems with implants and prostheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A self-report questionnaire for diagnosis of possible bruxism will be used. The maximum&#xD;
      occlusal force will be measured using a cross-arch compressive force transducer (Sensotec&#xD;
      13/2445-02, United States).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution and relative force of occlusal contacts will be assessed using the T-Scan&#xD;
      III equipment (Tekscan, United States). Patients will be asked to bite the intraoral device&#xD;
      five times for records in centric occlusion, lateral and protrusion movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's Perception&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient's overall satisfaction with the treatment results will be assessed with an&#xD;
      instrumental question: 'How satisfied are you with the results of the single crown supported&#xD;
      by a short implant? Please rate it from zero (equal to no satisfied at all) to ten (equal to&#xD;
      completely satisfied) on this line (10-point VAS)'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Oral health-related quality of life will be assessed by using the OHIP-14 instrument,&#xD;
      composed of 14 questions that cover seven dimensions: functional limitation, physical pain,&#xD;
      psychological discomfort, physical disability, disability social, psychological disability&#xD;
      and disability. Each question offers five alternatives: never (0), rarely (1), sometimes (2),&#xD;
      repeatedly (3) and always (4), and the total score ranges from 0 to 56. The additive method&#xD;
      will be used for data analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of perimplant bone changes and clinical C/I ratio&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perimplant bone changes will be assessed by using periapical radiographs and cone beam&#xD;
      computed tomography (CBCT) images for longitudinal 2-D and 3-D analyses, respectively.&#xD;
      Periapical digital radiographs of the implants will be performed using the long cone&#xD;
      parallelism technique. Using the computer program ImageJ version 1.3v (National Institutes of&#xD;
      Health, Bethesda, MD, USA), the marginal bone levels in relation to the implant platform will&#xD;
      be measured. CBCT images will be used for 3-D analysis of perimplant bone changes over time.&#xD;
      The images will be superimposed using reference points to compute volumetric bone loss and&#xD;
      morphological analysis of bone changes of cortical bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two measurements of each outcome measure will be performed by a blind examiner with a 30-day&#xD;
      interval for error/agreement evaluation and averaged for statistical analysis. In addition,&#xD;
      the radiographic trabecular bone changes in density will be evaluated by means of gray levels&#xD;
      and texture analysis variables. Longitudinal radiographic images of each implant were&#xD;
      superimposed, and the same regions of interest were selected for measurement of gray levels&#xD;
      statistics (mean gray levels, standard deviation and coefficient of variation) and texture&#xD;
      parameters (correlation, contrast, entropy and angular second moment). The free software&#xD;
      ImageJ will be used for gray levels and texture analysis by means of the GLCM Texture Tool&#xD;
      plugin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical C/I ratio will be calculated on the periapical radiographic image: The mean bone&#xD;
      level from the implant platform to the most coronal level of the bone-implant contact, on&#xD;
      both mesial and distal surfaces, will be subtracted from the actual implant size to compute&#xD;
      the clinical implant length. The clinical crown will be measured from the most coronal&#xD;
      bone-to-implant contact point to the highest cusp point. The clinical crown value will be&#xD;
      divided by the clinical implant value to compute the clinical C/I ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed by descriptive and inferential statistics at the significance level of&#xD;
      0.05. The success/survival estimates of implants and prostheses will be performed through&#xD;
      survival analysis. The general satisfaction and OHIP-14 data will be analyzed to compare&#xD;
      groups with and without complications. If preliminary assumptions are met, multiple linear&#xD;
      regression of mixed effects models should be used. Multivariate models will be compared over&#xD;
      time to assess possible differences in short (1 year), medium (4 years) and long (10 years)&#xD;
      clinical follow-up periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures to Protect or Minimize Eventual Risk and Data Confidentiality&#xD;
&#xD;
      All procedures follow a protocol approved by the university IRB and biosafety standards. Data&#xD;
      will be stored in a locked room, and access will be restricted. The PI will be legally&#xD;
      responsible for all stages of the research development and its dissemination.&#xD;
