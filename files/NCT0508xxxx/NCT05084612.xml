  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The laryngeal Mask Airway was developed by Brain in 1981 and was available for clinical use&#xD;
      in the United States by 1992 and has become very popular in routine medicine practice during&#xD;
      10 past years . LMA would serve as a choice to be used in the emergency situations even by&#xD;
      the inexperienced users . Nowadays due to the increasing number of outpatient anesthesia and&#xD;
      use of short-acting anesthetics almost without the use of any muscle relaxants requires an&#xD;
      appropriate way for safe LMA insertion. As LMA insertion is generally performed blindly,&#xD;
      clinicians are always in search of how to place and maintain the LMA in appropriate position.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The standard method of insertion described by Dr. Brain is relatively easy, but sometimes it&#xD;
      is impossible to insert the LMA with the standard method. However ease and time of airway&#xD;
      management may be of special importance in emergent situations. Since its inception the LMA&#xD;
      has undergone various modifications in type and material, which have made other methods of&#xD;
      insertion possible, quicker and easier than the standard method. Intraoral manipulation can&#xD;
      put the operator at risk of finger trauma and infection. However it is not possible to avoid&#xD;
      intraoral manipulation when the standard technique or the classic LMA is used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, many studies were seeking to find new methods to improve this technique. Hwang et&#xD;
      al. first described The 90° rotation technique in adults that involves the following steps:&#xD;
      the entire cuff of the LMA is inserted inside the mouth, rotated counter-clockwise through&#xD;
      90° and advanced until the resistance of the hypopharynx is felt . The use of this method is&#xD;
      known to increase the success rate of insertion and decrease the incidence of blood staining&#xD;
      of the LMA and sore throat compared to standard technique . Ghai et al. showed that&#xD;
      rotational technique may be considered as the first technique of choice for classical&#xD;
      laryngeal mask airway insertion in children . Lopez-Gil and colleagues reported a decrease in&#xD;
      complications with the increase in the skill of the anaesthetist . PARVIZ et al. described a&#xD;
      two person technique which performed by the technician who performs mouth opening and jaw&#xD;
      thrust and the anesthesiologist who inserts the laryngeal mask. They considered it as a safe&#xD;
      and effective method to establish a secure airway in anesthetized patients.. other studies&#xD;
      have shown that LMA insertion with partially inflated cuff is easier than deflated cuff .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current study will combine two methods of LMA insertion including two-persons and lateral&#xD;
      rotational techniques and compare them with the standard insertion method regarding the&#xD;
      success rate and incidence of complications.&#xD;

The LMA will be held like a pen and index finger will be placed at the junction of LMA tube and cuff. Index finger will be used to press the LMA against hard palate and posterior pharyngeal wall until definite resistance felt at the base of the hypopharynx. LMA will then be held with non-dominant hand and index finger will be removed.</description>

When neuromuscular blockade will be complete LMA will be inserted by a two Person Insertion with lateral rotation Technique; after lubrication of the posterior aspect of the partially deflated mask, the assistant will achieve jaw thrust and mouth opening then LMA will be inserted by the anaesthiologist. LMA will be inserted by holding the mask by index, middle finger and thumb; after insertion of the entire cuff inside the mouth, the LMA will be rotated anticlockwise through 90° (the inner surface of LMA will be directed medially towards the mouth cavity) and advanced through the side of the tongue until resistance felt, then turned back in the hypopharynx.</description>
