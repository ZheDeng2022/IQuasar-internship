  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      High blood potassium levels (hyperkalemia) is a major problem for people with kidney failure&#xD;
      undergoing hemodialysis treatment. In order to reduce the risk of hyperkalemia, people with&#xD;
      kidney failure are advised to limit or avoid high-potassium foods. However, high-potassium&#xD;
      foods comprise many healthy food choices, including commonly consumed fruits and vegetables&#xD;
      that are key sources of dietary fiber, and other important nutrients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of hyperkalemia from dietary potassium intake is most notable in the first few hours&#xD;
      after a meal when ingested potassium enters the bloodstream. In general, dietary potassium is&#xD;
      very well absorbed. However, dietary fiber has been shown to increase the proportion of&#xD;
      dietary potassium that is excreted in stool. Based on these findings, it has been proposed&#xD;
      that fiber may help to lower the risk of hyperkalemia in people with kidney disease. It&#xD;
      remains unclear whether dietary fiber increases potassium excretion in stool by reducing the&#xD;
      absorption of dietary potassium, or by drawing body potassium into the bowels by increasing&#xD;
      stool bulk. The distinction may be important, as reducing potassium absorption would be&#xD;
      expected to be of greater benefit in preventing hyperkalemia caused by eating high-potassium&#xD;
      foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will assess whether a fiber supplement can reduce the effect&#xD;
      of dietary potassium from orange juice on blood potassium levels in people with kidney&#xD;
      disease undergoing maintenance hemodialysis treatment.&#xD;

      The source population for this study will be adults (18-89 years old) with kidney failure&#xD;
      undergoing thrice weekly maintenance hemodialysis (HD) treatment. Participants will include&#xD;
      10 patients without diabetes mellitus, and 10 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2D)&#xD;
      that is being managed with lifestyle with or without long-acting insulin. Patients with a&#xD;
      moderate hyperkalemia (&gt;6.5 mEq/L) in the last 6-months, taking potassium-lowering&#xD;
      medications, having gastrointestinal (GI) disorders that may alter potassium digestion and&#xD;
      absorption, and low hemoglobin concentrations (&lt;10.0 g/dL) will be excluded. In addition,&#xD;
      participants who are deemed inappropriate for the intervention by the study Nephrologist&#xD;
      based on cognition, prognosis or pending treatments will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once enrolled, participants will be asked to complete questionnaires on demographics, dietary&#xD;
      intake, GI symptoms, and urine output. In addition, baseline data on anthropometrics,&#xD;
      physical function, medical history and blood parameters will be obtained by physical exam and&#xD;
      review of medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment measurement visits will be conducted on the same non-dialysis treatment days at the&#xD;
      University of Nevada, Reno Clinical Research Center with participants in a fasted state.&#xD;
      Serial blood samples will be collected before, and 60, 120 and 180 minutes after ingesting&#xD;
      orange juice providing 0.35 mEq/kg dose of potassium alone, or with 0.15 g/kg of&#xD;
      psyllium-based fiber. The sequence of treatments (1) orange juice or 2) orange juice + fiber)&#xD;
      will be randomly assigned with equal allocation by T2D status. If a participant's body weight&#xD;
      exceeds 120% of ideal body weight (IBW), then the dose of orange juice and fiber will be&#xD;
      based on adjusted body weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood tests at times 0 and 60-minutes post-treatment will be analyzed for the basic metabolic&#xD;
      panel plus insulin, and the 120- and 180-minutes blood samples will be analyzed for potassium&#xD;
      concentrations. The kalemic response to study treatments will assessed based on: 1) peak&#xD;
      change in plasma potassium concentrations, and 2) total area under the curve for plasma&#xD;
      potassium until 180-minutes. These parameters will be compared across treatment conditions&#xD;
      using paired t-test. If non-normally distributed, values will be log-transformed prior to&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
