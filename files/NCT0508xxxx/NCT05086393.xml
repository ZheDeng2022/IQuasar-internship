  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to determine if duloxetine is associated with differences in&#xD;
      post-operative pain, patient-reported outcome measures, and opioid consumption in patients&#xD;
      undergoing primary total knee arthroplasty compared to patients who do not receive the&#xD;
      medication. If so, duloxetine has the potential to become widely incorporated into the&#xD;
      multi-modal analgesic regimen given to patients following knee replacements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite advances in surgical techniques and multimodal analgesia, many patients experience&#xD;
      severe pain following total knee arthroplasty (TKA). In addition, chronic osteoarthritis, the&#xD;
      most common reason patients undergo arthroplasty, predisposes patients to neuropathic pain&#xD;
      with an estimated 23% of osteoarthritic patients suffering from neuropathic pain in addition&#xD;
      to their nociceptive pain. This process is believed to lower the pain threshold and may lead&#xD;
      to central sensitization, a condition defined as &quot;the increase in the excitability and&#xD;
      synaptic efficacy of neurons in the central nociceptive pathways that manifests as pain&#xD;
      hypersensitivity.&quot; Central sensitization is present in 20% to 40% of patients with advanced&#xD;
      knee osteoarthritis and believed to predispose them to increased preoperative and&#xD;
      postoperative levels of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies, duloxetine has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and opioid&#xD;
      consumption. In a 2019 randomized controlled trial (RCT), Ko et al. reported that 30&#xD;
      milligrams (mg) of duloxetine administered one day prior to surgery and continued for 6 weeks&#xD;
      after surgery decreased pain scores in patients with central sensitization who underwent TKA.&#xD;
      Duloxetine administered for a shorter duration of time has also shown beneficial results. In&#xD;
      their 2010 study, Ho et al. found that although 60 mg of duloxetine administered prior to&#xD;
      surgery and on the first postoperative day did not significantly improve postoperative pain&#xD;
      scores, it significantly reduced postoperative inpatient morphine requirements following TKA.&#xD;
      Similarly, in a 2016, triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, YaDeau et al.&#xD;
      found that 60 mg of duloxetine given for 15 days following surgery did not significantly&#xD;
      impact pain scores but did significantly reduce opioid consumption in the two weeks following&#xD;
      TKA. Although promising, these previous studies are difficult to interpret as they evaluated&#xD;
      different patient populations, used different dosages of duloxetine, and administered for&#xD;
      different lengths of time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To our knowledge, all previous prospective, randomized controlled trials have examined only&#xD;
      patients undergoing TKA, either focused only on patients with central sensitization or failed&#xD;
      to differentiate between patients with and without central sensitization in their study&#xD;
      population, or failed to administer duloxetine for the 4-8 week duration that has been&#xD;
      traditionally recommended to assess the efficacy of SNRIs for other clinical indications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers propose to fill this knowledge gap by conducting a study that evaluates TKA&#xD;
      patients, includes and differentiates patients with and without central sensitization, and&#xD;
      administers duloxetine for the full recommended trial duration.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Patients randomized to the experimental arm of the study will receive 30 mg of duloxetine and will be advised to consume the medication orally daily starting one week prior to surgery and to continue until 6 weeks following surgery. The dose of 30 mg was selected as that has been used as that is the largest starting dose used in other RCTs without requiring a preceding adjustment period at a lower dosage. Patients randomized to the control arm will receive placebo tablets and advised to consume their medication similar to the treatment arm. Both groups of patients will receive their medications from the pharmacy at Rush Medical Center, which will be responsible for providing patients with the appropriate regimen. All patients will receive the same postoperative multimodal analgesic regimen that is normally administered as part of conventional care to patients undergoing THA and TKA at Rush University Medical Center.</intervention_model_description>

    <masking>Triple (Participant, Care Provider, Investigator)</masking>
    <masking_description>This study will be triple-blind, thus, the patients, clinicians, and study members involved will be unaware of patient allocation during this study. After the patient completes his or her Central Sensitization Inventory, a study coordinator will grade the survey to determine if the patient should be allocated to the groups with central sensitization or without. Each patient will receive a study ID based on his or her group (detailed in Section XIV). A computer randomization system will be used to allocate patients to receive either duloxetine or a placebo based on their study ID. Only members of the Rush pharmacy staff will possess the list matching the study ID to the study group assignment, ensuring that the study remains triple-blinded and that study coordinators are unaware of a patient's assignment when he or she picks up the study medication from the pharmacy.</masking_description>
