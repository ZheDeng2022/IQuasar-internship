      The aim of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness and safety of the 14-day continuous ECG&#xD;
      patch monitor (EZYPRO®) compared with a 24-hour Holter monitor in the detection of atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation (AF) among ESUS patients.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Afib detected by 24-hour Holter</measure>
    <time_frame>24 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Day 1 of the trial, patients will wear simultaneously 12-lead ECG, 24-hour Holter and the trial device, EZYPRO 14-day monitoring patch. After at least 20 hours of Holter, it will be removed and the ECG data will be collected and analyzed for arrhythmia, especially atrial fibrillation. If AF is detected by Holter, patients will be prescribed NOAC; if no AF is detected, patients will be prescribed antiplatelet agents instead.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Afib detected by 14-day EZYPRO</measure>
    <time_frame>14 days</time_frame>
    <description>Day 1 of the trial, patients will wear simultaneously a 12-lead ECG, 24-hour Holter, and the trial device, EZYPRO 14-day monitoring patch. 24-hour Holter will be removed first after at least wearing it for 20 hours with the continuant of EZYPRO. Patients have to wear EZYPRO for up to 14 days. After patch removal, the ECG data will be analyzed by the sponsor team and provide an ECG report to investigators. Arrhythmias, expecially AF, will be presented in the report for further treatment. If AF is detected by EZYPRO and Holter, patients will be prescribed NOAC; if no AF is detected by either one, patients will be prescribed antiplatelet agents instead.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Skin irritation by EZYPRO patch</measure>
    <time_frame>180 days</time_frame>
    <description>Before wearing 24-hour Holter and EZYPRO, patients' skin condition will be assessed by trial investigators based on Dermal Response Score, FDA-2018-D-3546, on a scale of 0 to 7. After the removal of EZYPRO, the skin condition will be assessed again. At each follow-up visit, the skin condition will be assessed as well. The aim of this evaluation is to observe the safety of EZYPRO and confirm if it will help enhance patient compliance.</description>
