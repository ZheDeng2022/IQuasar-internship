  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The development of cognitive dysfunction can profoundly affect HR-QoL as well as the&#xD;
      possibility of societal participation and ability to work, and thereby relevantly impacts&#xD;
      prospects for cancer survivorship. Therefore, we aim to obtain improved understanding of the&#xD;
      scope and magnitude of objective cognitive dysfunction in DTC survivors, and its relation to&#xD;
      subjective cognitive dysfunction, thyroid hormone levels, physical activity and HRQoL. We&#xD;
      plan to do this by performing a prospective study where patients operated for a thyroid&#xD;
      nodule (Bethesda IV-VI, i.e., benign [goitre with nodule and fibroadenomas], low-risk DTC and&#xD;
      intermediate-high risk DTC) are included and asked to serially perform online&#xD;
      neuropsychological testing as well as to complete questionnaires related to HR-QoL, physical&#xD;
      activity and additional psychological and physical complaints. Blood is analysed for levels&#xD;
      of thyroid hormones and systemic inflammation.&#xD;

      The primary aim of this study is to prospectively assess objective cognitive functioning in&#xD;
      patients undergoing thyroid surgery for different indications by means of an online&#xD;
      neuropsychological test, the Amsterdam Cognition Scale (ACS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three patient groups are defined; 1) patients with follicular adenomas, 2) patients with&#xD;
      extreme low-risk differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC; pT1a and pN0/x tumours), 3) patients in&#xD;
      all other DTC risk groups (i.e., low, intermediate and high-risk). The primary comparison&#xD;
      confers to groups 1 and 3.&#xD;
