      I. Hypotheses and Specific Aims: This proof of concept comparative effectiveness study seeks&#xD;
      to pilot the administration of IM naltrexone among hospitalized adults with Diagnostic and&#xD;
      Stastistical Manual-5 (DSM-5) diagnosis of alcohol use disorder at the University of Colorado&#xD;
      Hospital and examine its acceptability and feasibility among patients and healthcare&#xD;
      providers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim 1: Test the feasibility and acceptability of recruiting, enrolling, and randomizing&#xD;
      hospitalized patients, age 18 to 65 years old, with alcohol use disorder to treatment with&#xD;
      in-hospital administration of IM naltrexone (n=30) versus oral naltrexone (n=60), both with&#xD;
      linkage to outpatient follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 1: Outcomes such as recruitment rate, adverse events, and provider perception of&#xD;
      the intervention's feasibility and acceptability in their clinical practice will help&#xD;
      identify key lessons for a future comparative effectiveness study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim 2: Estimate the combined 30-day readmission rate plus 30-day emergency department&#xD;
      encounter rate for participants randomized to IM naltrexone vs. oral naltrexone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 2: Combined 30-day readmission rate and emergency department encounter rate will&#xD;
      be lower for IM naltrexone participants compared to oral naltrexone participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Aim 3: Estimate the 90-day treatment linkage rate for participants randomized to IM&#xD;
      naltrexone vs. oral naltrexone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis 3: The 90-day treatment linkage rates will be higher for IM naltrexone&#xD;
      participants compared to oral naltrexone participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design and Research Methods Study Design: This study is pilot proof-of-concept,&#xD;
      open-label comparative effectiveness trial of IM naltrexone vs. oral naltrexone among&#xD;
      hospitalized adults with alcohol use disorder. Study outcomes include 1) an assessment of the&#xD;
      feasibility to recruit, enroll, and randomize hospitalized patients to IM naltrexone (n=30)&#xD;
      or oral naltrexone (n=60) and 2) an assessment of provider's perceived feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability to deliver the intervention. Comparative effectiveness outcomes include&#xD;
      assessing the 1) combined 30-day readmission rate and 30-day emergency department encounter&#xD;
      rate and 2) 90-day treatment linkage rates for participants randomized to IM naltrexone vs.&#xD;
      oral naltrexone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site: The study will be conducted at the University of Colorado Hospital (UCH) where&#xD;
      there is a weekday Addiction Medicine Consultation Service (ACS) who provides&#xD;
      medication-assisted treatment for alcohol use disorder, including naltrexone, with&#xD;
      facilitated linkage to post-discharge addiction care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Eligible participants will be identified by an ACS team member through daily&#xD;
      review of the ACS consultation list, focusing on consultation orders for &quot;alcohol&quot;, e.g.,&#xD;
      alcohol withdrawal, and the sequela of alcohol use, trauma in the setting of alcohol&#xD;
      intoxication, acute encephalopathy, and/or seizures, delirium tremens related to alcohol&#xD;
      withdrawal. ACS attendings will complete routine addiction medicine care, including history&#xD;
      taking, performing a physical exam, reviewing laboratory values, and a discussion of the&#xD;
      assessment and plan, while considering the patient's alcohol use goals e.g., cut back,&#xD;
      abstinence, no change in use, etc. If the patient meets criteria for an alcohol use disorder,&#xD;
      the ACS attending will consider the use of naltrexone as medication-assisted treatment. If&#xD;
      the patient expresses an interest in naltrexone, the attending will contact the one of the&#xD;
      two addiction medicine team social workers or peer navigator, who is not involved in the&#xD;
      patient's care, will approach the patient to inquire if the participants are interested in&#xD;
      participating in the study. If the patient agrees, the participants will be consented and&#xD;
      enrolled into the study and will be randomized to 2:1 to oral naltrexone or IM naltrexone.&#xD;
      The ACS team member will alert the ACS attending who will either prescribe oral naltrexone to&#xD;
      start during hospitalization with a 30-day prescription at discharge or who will administer&#xD;
      IM naltrexone prior to hospital discharge. If the patient declines enrollment, the ACS&#xD;
      attending will prescribe a 30-day supply of oral naltrexone. If a patient is interested in&#xD;
      receiving IM naltrexone, the participants will be scheduled a follow-up appointment with a&#xD;
      local clinic that provides this medication in the outpatient setting. All patients will be&#xD;
      offered a follow-up appointment for ongoing treatment for their alcohol use disorder&#xD;
      regardless of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will be randomized 2:1 to of oral naltrexone (n=60) oral&#xD;
      naltrexone or IM naltrexone (n=30). Oral naltrexone is a once daily medication. IM naltrexone&#xD;
      is dosed once monthly and is injected into the gluteal tissue. All participants will be&#xD;
      scheduled a follow-up appointment with an addiction treatment provider or primary care&#xD;
      provider between 30 to 90 days post hospital discharge, unless the participants decline the&#xD;
      appointment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cost of oral naltrexone is covered by most insurance plans, including Colorado Medicaid,&#xD;
      and is readily available in most pharmacies. For uninsured patients, the ACS team will work&#xD;
      with the Atrium pharmacy and team social worker to obtain a voucher for medication coverage.&#xD;
      This is the usual process for medication payment when a patient is unable to afford their&#xD;
      medication co-pay or the cost of the medication at UCH. IM naltrexone is produced by&#xD;
      Alkermes. Due to bundled insurance payments for hospitalizations, administration of IM&#xD;
      naltrexone is prohibited for in-hospital administration at UCH (and at many hospitals) due to&#xD;
      lack of reimbursement for services and product. In light of the potential treatment gap for&#xD;
      hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder, Alkermes created the &quot;Hospital Inpatient&#xD;
      Free Trail Program&quot;24. This program allows for in-hospital administration of IM naltrexone&#xD;
      which is provided free to the patient as a sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of study enrollment, the ACS team member will ask a series of validated questions&#xD;
      from the Addiction Severity Index Lite (ASI-Lite), a widely used instrument to assess the&#xD;
      severity of problems related to substance use.30-32 The survey questions produce reliable and&#xD;
      valid estimates of patient status in various life domains including 1) alcohol use, 2)&#xD;
      medical health, 3) employment, and 4) illegal activity.33 These measure are mathematically&#xD;
      derived and have shown reliability and validity in several settings.33 Composite scores will&#xD;
      be assessed and reported for questions related to medical condition and alcohol use at&#xD;
      baseline (see Appendix, Table 1 for ASI questions and composite questions). Assessments will&#xD;
      be completed online using REDCap survey tools. Appendix, Table 1 lists baseline ASI-Lite&#xD;
      questions to be asked.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surveys to assess provider's perceived feasibility and acceptability of the intervention will&#xD;
      be sent out prior to the study implementation, at study midpoint (when enrollment is 50%&#xD;
      complete), and at study completion. The survey will be sent to all providers on the ACS&#xD;
      (social workers, peer navigators, and physicians) (n=13). Surveys will be created and&#xD;
      disseminated in REDCap and will be sent out in three waves to improve response rate. The&#xD;
      survey will include sections where ACS team members can type in their thoughts and&#xD;
      perceptions of the intervention and make any recommendations for improvement. These data will&#xD;
      be qualitative, in contrast to the quantitative survey data, and will be used to inform our&#xD;
      future comparative effectiveness trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Tools: REDCap or the Electronic Helath Record (EHR) via Health Data Compass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis Plan:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline Comparison of Treatment Groups: Participant's characteristics and baseline clinical&#xD;
      data will be tabulated, and differences between IM vs. oral naltrexone groups will be&#xD;
      assessed using a Fisher's Exact Test for categorical variables and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests&#xD;
      and Chi-squared tests for continuous variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Propensity Score Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting: The investigators will use&#xD;
      inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW) based on the propensity score to reduce&#xD;
      bias by ensuring that participants who are randomized to IM naltrexone (n=30) vs. oral&#xD;
      naltrexone (n=60) will have comparable covariate distributions. Propensity scores will be&#xD;
      calculated from a multivariable logistic regression model with a binary outcome of IM&#xD;
      naltrexone treatment or oral naltrexone treatment. Variables shown in Appendix, Table 1 will&#xD;
      be included if the variables are significantly associated with both IM naloxone treatment and&#xD;
      the outcome or with the outcome only.34 Significance will be assessed based on clinical&#xD;
      judgement and bivariate statistical analysis (p-value &lt; 0.05). If highly collinear variables&#xD;
      are included in the model, variables associated with both IM naloxone treatment and the&#xD;
      outcome will be preferred over those only associated with the outcome.35 Weights will be&#xD;
      stabilized to more accurately estimate variance if a small number of weights become&#xD;
      especially large and influential due to particularly low or high propensity scores. After&#xD;
      applying weights, covariate distributions will be compared between the group receiving IM&#xD;
      naltrexone and the group receiving oral naltrexone to ensure that confounding variable&#xD;
      distributions are approximately balanced between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once IM naltrexone and oral naltrexone groups are matched, the investigators will assess&#xD;
      comparative effectiveness outcomes, 30-day all cause hospitalization rates+ 30-day emergency&#xD;
      department encounter rates by IM vs. oral naltrexone, and 90-day post discharge linkage rates&#xD;
      by IM vs. oral naltrexone group. This pilot study is not sufficiently powered for hypothesis&#xD;
      testing on these outcomes. By way of example, the use of 30 participants compared to 60&#xD;
      participant controls yields just 40% power to detect a 50% relative difference in readmission&#xD;
      using a pilot appropriate alpha of 10%.36 Regardless, the readmission risk differences will&#xD;
      be evaluated using multiple logistic regression to assess the association of treatment on&#xD;
      30-day combined readmissions and emergency department encounter rates. The investigators will&#xD;
      use multiple logistic regression to assess the association between IM naltrexone or oral&#xD;
      naltrexone on 90-day addiction treatment linkage. These findings will provide parameter&#xD;
      estimates that can inform a future sample size calculation in a larger effectiveness trial.&#xD;
