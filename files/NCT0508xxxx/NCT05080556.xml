  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      ACTOv will compare standard 3-weekly carboplatin (AUC5), to carboplatin delivered according&#xD;
      to an AT regimen. The AT regimen will modify carboplatin dose according to changes in the&#xD;
      clinical-standard serum biomarker CA125 as a proxy measure of total tumour burden and an&#xD;
      individual patient's response to the most recent chemotherapy treatment. AT could prolong&#xD;
      sensitivity to carboplatin and extend tumour control, while simultaneously reducing&#xD;
      chemotherapy dose and drug-induced toxicity. Carboplatin is a low cost and low toxicity drug&#xD;
      that has an enduring and central role in ovarian cancer treatment.&#xD;
