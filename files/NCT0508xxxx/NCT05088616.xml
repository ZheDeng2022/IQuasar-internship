      Diabetes in the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) population is a public health crisis&#xD;
      that is best addressed using a holistic approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the disproportionate rates of diabetes and diabetes-related outcomes among AIANs, this&#xD;
      is the perfect opportunity to provide a culturally tailored health promotion intervention&#xD;
      among the largest urban AIAN population in the U.S.; approximately 171,163 AIANs reside in&#xD;
      Los Angeles County. It is imperative to develop culturally tailored interventions with a&#xD;
      community-based participatory research approach. Particularly given a legacy of historical&#xD;
      mistrust, development of trusted and mutually beneficial partnerships is imperative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this pilot study is to reach up to 312 Native Americans with diabetes to&#xD;
      participate in an intervention to lower blood sugar and feelings of social isolation. The&#xD;
      intervention will include 12 weeks of diabetes-friendly, medically tailored meals and four&#xD;
      weeks of virtual diabetes wellness classes. Participants will also attend an initial&#xD;
      meet-and-greet before the classes start and a final check-in meeting after the classes end.&#xD;
      Partners for these activities include Project Angel Food and United American Indian&#xD;
      Involvement (UAII). Each of the four virtual classes will be held for 90-minutes through the&#xD;
      Zoom platform. Each participant will be part of a 180-day cohort. Participants will complete&#xD;
      surveys and attend three clinic visits as part of the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diabetes in the American Indian and Alaska Native (AIAN) population is a public health&#xD;
      crisis. AIAN have the highest diabetes prevalence rates when compared to other racial and&#xD;
      ethnic populations in the United States. According to the Centers for Disease Control and&#xD;
      Prevention, 14.7% of AIAN adults compared to 7.5% of non-Hispanic Whites have been diagnosed&#xD;
      with diabetes. In California (CA), those who self-identify as having CA Tribal heritage are&#xD;
      twice as likely than individuals from tribes outside of CA to be diagnosed with diabetes (31%&#xD;
      versus 16%). Significant disparities also exist in diabetes-related outcomes. Compared to the&#xD;
      general population, AIANs are 2.3 times more likely to die from diabetes, and the incidence&#xD;
      of diabetes-related kidney failure among AIANs is 2.0 times higher. Cardiovascular disease&#xD;
      among AIANs with diabetes may be 3-8 times higher than those AIAN without diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diabetes crisis among AIAN is best addressed using a holistic approach. Aside from&#xD;
      addressing the impact of diabetes on several physical health outcomes, best practices also&#xD;
      include addressing the impact of trauma and mental and emotional health, providing robust&#xD;
      patient education, and addressing structural barriers such as food insecurity, lack of access&#xD;
      to healthy food, living in poverty, limited social support, and lack of access to health&#xD;
      care, especially that which is culturally responsive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the disproportionate rates of diabetes and diabetes-related outcomes among AIANs, this&#xD;
      is the perfect opportunity to provide a culturally tailored health promotion intervention&#xD;
      among the largest urban AIAN population in the U.S.; approximately 171,163 AIANs reside in&#xD;
      Los Angeles County.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of this pilot study is to reach up to 312 Native Americans with diabetes to&#xD;
      participate in an intervention to lower blood sugar and feelings of social isolation. The&#xD;
      intervention will include 12 weeks of diabetes-friendly, medically tailored meals and four&#xD;
      weeks of virtual diabetes wellness classes. The meals are pre-made and frozen by Project&#xD;
      Angel Food, a meal preparation and delivery company located in Los Angeles, CA. Fourteen&#xD;
      meals (7 days x 2 meals per day: lunch/dinner) will be provided weekly for 12 weeks. The&#xD;
      virtual diabetes wellness classes use a culturally tailored four-week curriculum.&#xD;
      Participants will also attend an initial meet-and-greet before the classes start and a final&#xD;
      check-in meeting after the classes end. The classes will be implemented by United American&#xD;
      Indian Involvement (UAII) staff. Each of the four virtual class sessions will be held for&#xD;
      90-minutes through the Zoom platform. Participants will begin the 4-week curriculum&#xD;
      approximately the same week they start receiving the medically tailored meals. After the four&#xD;
      weeks of classes are completed, participants will continue to receive meals for the remaining&#xD;
      (approximate) 8 weeks. Each participant will be part of a 180-day cohort, during which&#xD;
      participants will complete surveys and attend three clinic visits (where their blood&#xD;
      pressure, weight, height, and A1c levels--via finger stick--will be measured).&#xD;
