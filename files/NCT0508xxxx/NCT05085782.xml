  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to document the feasibility and acceptability of an&#xD;
      intervention consisting of pain neuroscience education and reconsolidation therapy with&#xD;
      propranolol in adults suffering from chronic pain (chronic low back pain or fibromyalgia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary aim of the study is to estimate the effect size of the intervention on pain and&#xD;
      function one month post-intervention, and to obtain data for sample-size calculation for a&#xD;
      subsequent RCT.&#xD;
