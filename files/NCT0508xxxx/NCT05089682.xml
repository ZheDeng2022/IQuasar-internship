      The aim of this study is to investigate whether researchers can improve sleep quality in&#xD;
      patients with deep brain stimulators by delivering targeted stimulation patterns during&#xD;
      specific stages of sleep.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  DBS in one of the defined nuclei of interest during the period of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, aged 18 years and above&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be willing and able to give written and oral informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to complete all required study procedures including travelling to Mayo Clinic&#xD;
             and staying overnight&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All women of childbearing potential and women who have been amenorrheic for less than&#xD;
             1 year must practice effective contraception during the study. This includes a barrier&#xD;
             method such as condom or diaphragm with spermicide; barrier intrauterine device (IUD)&#xD;
             or abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment (judged by the clinician taking consent as not having sufficient&#xD;
             mental capacity to understand the study and its requirements). This is including&#xD;
             anyone who, in the opinion of the clinician taking consent is unlikely to retain&#xD;
             sufficient mental capacity for the duration of their involvement in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any other medical condition that would interfere with study conduct or&#xD;
             make it unsafe for them to participate&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy test positive.&#xD;
