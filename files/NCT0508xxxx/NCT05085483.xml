      Efficacy of a nutritional ketogenic supplement (NKS) in reducing the number, intensity, and&#xD;
      duration of migraine headaches in episodic migraine patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The KEMIP study is a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, full cross-over, study to&#xD;
      test the efficacy of NKS at reducing migraine days per month (MDM) compared to placebo in&#xD;
      episodic migraine participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will prompted to enter data on migraine headache features (duration, pain&#xD;
      intensity, medication use, symptoms) and product intake in an eDiary every day throughout the&#xD;
      course of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will complete five steps of 1 month each: (1) baseline evaluation; (2)&#xD;
      NKS/placebo intake; (3) washout &amp; cross-over; (4) NKS/placebo intake; (5) follow-up&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Men and women aged ≥18 years who have previously been diagnosed with migraine, with or&#xD;
             without aura, in accordance with the ICHD-3 Classification criteria;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an estimated frequency of 5 to 14 MDM in each of the 3 months prior to enrolment;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In principle, agree at the beginning (virtual call V0) to adequately complete a&#xD;
             headache electronic diary (e-Diary) on at least 24 days out of the 28 days in the&#xD;
             run-in baseline period;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In practice, adequately complete by the end of V1 a headache eDiary on at least 24&#xD;
             days out of the 28 days in the run-in baseline period;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to refrain from initiating or changing the type, dosage, or frequency of any&#xD;
             prophylactic medications against migraine, and any treatments for indications other&#xD;
             than migraine that in the opinion of the clinician may interfere with the study&#xD;
             objectives, e.g. antidepressants, anticonvulsants, beta-blockers, etc. for the&#xD;
             duration of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential must agree to use a medically effective form of&#xD;
             contraception, unless they can confirm they've had bilateral tubal ligation or that&#xD;
             their male partner has had a vasectomy (provided that the partner is the sole sexual&#xD;
             partner of the trial participant and that the vasectomised partner has received&#xD;
             medical assessment of the surgical success). Medically effective forms of&#xD;
             contraception include hormonal methods, such as the contraceptive pill or implant&#xD;
             (stable use for at least 3 months prior to enrolment), an intrauterine device (IUD) in&#xD;
             use at least 30 days before enrolment, or barrier methods such as diaphragm plus&#xD;
             spermicide or condom plus spermicide, in use at least 14 days before enrolment. In&#xD;
             circumstances in which hormonal methods may interfere with the action of the IP or&#xD;
             placebo, or in which the use of spermicides may increase the risk of transmission of&#xD;
             disease, a double-barrier method is recommended.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Agree to refrain from making any drastic changes to their usual diet for the duration&#xD;
             of the study, particularly periods of fasting;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a smartphone with Android or mobile operating system version compatible with&#xD;
             eDiary;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to provide informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

        triglycerides (MCT) 1 month prior to the initiation of the study or during the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients using regular high dose of Vitamin B3, calcium (&gt;1 g/day) or magnesium (&gt;350&#xD;
             mg/day) supplements 1 month prior to the initiation of the study or during the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Suffer from other primary (e.g. tension-type headache, trigeminal autonomic&#xD;
             cephalalgias, other primary headache disorders) or secondary headaches (e.g. headaches&#xD;
             attributed to trauma or injury, vascular or non-vascular intracranial disorders,&#xD;
             substances or their withdrawal, infections, alterations of homeostasis), hemiplegic&#xD;
             migraine;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy or intending to become pregnant, or is of childbearing potential and has not&#xD;
             had tubal ligation, has a male partner who has not had a successful vasectomy, and is&#xD;
             unwilling to use a medically effective form of contraception, i.e. oral contraceptive&#xD;
             pills, injectable, or implantable contraceptive; intrauterine device; or&#xD;
             double-barrier method (e.g. diaphragm and condom), or is lactating during the study&#xD;
             duration. In addition, women of child-bearing potential on hormone-based contraception&#xD;
             should not intend to stop or change their contraceptive for the duration of the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant medical history, for example diabetes mellitus, renal stones, kidney and&#xD;
             liver failure, somatic or psychiatric conditions, uncontrolled hypertension or&#xD;
             medicated for hypertension, known hypercalcemia, history of or current cardiovascular&#xD;
             disease, chronic gastrointestinal (GI) disease or intestinal malabsorption, or other&#xD;
             illness, disease or syndrome which the investigators deem unsuitable to participate in&#xD;
             the study;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant medication history, for example use of corticosteroids in format of oral&#xD;
             or injectable;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Vaccination planned 2 weeks prior the start of the study, or during the study;&#xD;
