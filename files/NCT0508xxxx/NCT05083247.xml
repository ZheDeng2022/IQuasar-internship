    <textblock>
      Background:Surgical resection is the only potentially curative treatment for patients with&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer with the aim of curative R0 resection and related improvement of survival.&#xD;
      As a standard, surgery is usually followed by adjuvant therapy that improves survival but&#xD;
      neoadjuvant therapy (NAT) is a rapidly emerging concept that needs to be explored and&#xD;
      validated in terms of therapeutic options, in both resectable and borderline resectable&#xD;
      pancreatic tumors. In this setting, preoperative FFX seems to be feasible and can be&#xD;
      prolonged by radiation therapy (chemoRT or SBRT) with promising benefits for patients in&#xD;
      terms of R0 resection, local control and prolonged survival. However, the exact and best&#xD;
      therapeutic sequence is not yet known and the additional role of adding radiation therapy to&#xD;
      chemotherapy requires validation in randomised trials. We recently reported the feasibility&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy data of the whole therapeutic sequence combining preoperative FFX x&#xD;
      8 cycles (G-Nab-P in case of intolerance or no response ) prolonged by 5 days SBRT (35 Gy +&#xD;
      SIB up to 50Gy at the tumour-vessel interfaces )[1, manuscript submitted]. We propose now to&#xD;
      evaluate the impact and efficacy of adding isotoxic high-dose SBRT to preoperative&#xD;
      neoadjuvant mFFX or Gem-NabP in patients with borderline or high-risk resectable pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma. We hypothesize that this full sequence strategy of pre-operative treatment is&#xD;
      safe and feasible and will improve both the R0 resection rate and prognosis (DFS as primary&#xD;
      end point) of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, especially by targeting the tumoural vascular&#xD;
      encasement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives/endpoints: Evaluation of the safety and efficacy of pre-operative 8 cycles of&#xD;
      modified FOLFIRINOX (or Gem-Nab-P) followed or not by SBRT in patients with borderline or at&#xD;
      risk resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare DFS between arms&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To compare between the study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Resection rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  R0 resection rate (&gt; 1 mm)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall survival (OS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Locoregional failure free interval (LFFI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Distant metastases free interval (DMFI)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete feasibility of the therapeutic sequence&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathologic complete response rate (pCR)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toxicity (early and late)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative complications rate&#xD;

      STUDY DESIGN Academic, prospective, randomised comparative, interventional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Arm A: mFOLFIRINOX* x 8 cycles followed by surgery (+3-4w) Arm B: mFOLFIRINOX* x 6 cycles&#xD;
      followed by iHD-SBRT then mFFX x2 followed by surgery (+3-4w)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive 8 cycles of modified FOLFIRINOX (consists of oxaliplatin, irinotecan,&#xD;
      leucovorin and 5-FU). A full restaging (clinical, morphologic imaging, vascular involvement,&#xD;
      biologics, CA 19.9) is performed. Non-progressive patients will be randomised after full&#xD;
      restaging for receiving 5th and 6th cycles of chemo +/- stereotactic radiation. Adjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy administration is indicated unless the patient's condition precludes it.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  *: in case of CI or intolerance to FFX , gemcitabine-nab-paclitaxel regimen can be&#xD;
           chosen or shifted to for 12 doses (6 then restaging then 3 to 6 followed by SBRT or&#xD;
           immediate surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In case of early intolerance or progression, chemotherapy shift is authorised&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment agents:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. mFOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin: 85 mg/m2, CPT-11: 165-180 mg/m2, folinic acid: 400mg/m2 and&#xD;
           5FU 2000-2400 mg/m2/46 h) regimen for 6-8 cycles every 2 weeks; *Gemcitabine-Nab-P: gem:&#xD;
           1000 mg/m2 weekly 3 w/4; nab-P: 125 mg/m2 3 w/4 for 3-4 cycles if unfit for mFFX).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Isotoxic high-dose SBRT: 5 x 7Gy with Simultaneous Integrated Boost (SIB) up to maximum&#xD;
           55Gy (= 1 week; starting ideally 2 weeks and maximum within 4 weeks after the end of&#xD;
           chemotherapy) after placement of EUS guided fiducials (Cook ECHO-TIP F 22G™ or&#xD;
           polymarks™ charged 19G needle).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Surgery: intra-abdominal exploration with or without pancreatectomy (with minimum&#xD;
           multiple biopsies if complete surgery not feasible) performed 6 to 8 weeks after SBRT&#xD;
           completion. The final decision to perform a pancreatectomy or not is left to the final&#xD;
           judgment of the specialist surgeon at the time of surgery. Surgery will be performed in&#xD;
           expert centers as defined by the INAMI-RIZIV convention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Adjuvant chemotherapy is indicated for at least 4 months unless the patient's condition&#xD;
           precludes it (regimen left to investigator's choice) and should be started within 3&#xD;
           months after surgery.&#xD;
