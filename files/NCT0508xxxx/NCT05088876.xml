      Blinded withdrawal of regular co-medication with paracetamol in chronic pain patients under&#xD;
      strong opioids on pain control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain cancer patients receiving a strong opioid in combination with paracetamol in a&#xD;
      minimum dose of 3 g/day will be randomized to receive either paracetamol in the dose already&#xD;
      prescribed (group &quot;paracetamol&quot;) or an identically looking placebo (group &quot;placebo&quot;) using&#xD;
      the same schedule during the first study phase (days 1-10). In the second study phase (days&#xD;
      11-20) paracetamol or placebo will be stopped in both arms to assess the effect of pill&#xD;
      withdrawal on pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be instructed to use a pain diary to rate their pain at baseline and during&#xD;
      the study and also document the required opioid rescue doses. Further assessments will&#xD;
      include adverse events, subjective ratings of quality of sleep, overall feeling of&#xD;
      well-being, functioning and quality of life. At the screening visit, patients will also be&#xD;
      asked to rate their expected changes in pain relief as a result of co-treatment with&#xD;
      paracetamol. At the completion of the study, patients will be asked about their satisfaction&#xD;
      and preference and whether, overall, they felt their pain was more poorly controlled during&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between the on-site visits at baseline, day 10 and day 20, patients will be followed up by&#xD;
      phone calls every 3 days (Â±1d) and will have an End of Study visit on day 20. Adherence will&#xD;
      be checked by pill count and measurement of paracetamol blood concentrations. Genotyping of&#xD;
      OPRM1, COMT and relevant CYP enzymes and opioid blood concentrations will be assessed as&#xD;
      co-variates for pain control.&#xD;
