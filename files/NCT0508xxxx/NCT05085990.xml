  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is open-label dose expansion study to investigate the safety and toxicity of&#xD;
      intravesical treatment of high-grade NMIBC (HGTa or CIS) after transurethral resection of&#xD;
      bladder tumor (TURBT) and/or biopsy using TARA-002 in adults unable to obtain intravesical&#xD;
      Bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG), adults who have received at least one dose of intravesical&#xD;
      BCG or adults who have received at least one dose of intravesical chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the dose escalation phase (Phase 1a) and after the RP2D has been&#xD;
      established, the dose expansion phase (Phase 1b) will start enrollment of subjects with CIS&#xD;
      NMIBC with active disease to further evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of&#xD;
      TARA-002, at the established RP2D. Subjects enrolled in the dose expansion phase will not&#xD;
      include subjects previously enrolled and treated in the dose escalation phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will receive 6 weeks of treatment at the established RP2D.&#xD;
