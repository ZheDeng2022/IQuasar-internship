  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pediatric traumatic injury (i.e., injury of sudden onset and severity requiring immediate&#xD;
      attention) is the leading cause of death and morbidity among US adolescents and are&#xD;
      associated with mental health and health risk outcomes, including posttraumatic stress and&#xD;
      depression (affecting between 19-42%), deficits in physical recovery, social functioning and&#xD;
      quality of life, which if unaddressed, may contribute to increased use of health care&#xD;
      services. The investigators partnered with three accredited Level I and II pediatric trauma&#xD;
      centers to conduct a multi-site hybrid 1 effectiveness-implementation trial with 300&#xD;
      adolescent (ages 12-17) traumatic injury patients to assess the extent to which the Trauma&#xD;
      Resilience and Recovery Program (TRRP), a scalable and sustainable, technology-enhanced,&#xD;
      multidisciplinary stepped model of care, promotes improvement in quality of life and&#xD;
      emotional recovery and gather preliminary data on the potential for TRRP to be implemented in&#xD;
      other Level I trauma centers. Directly in line with NICHD's Pediatric Trauma and Critical&#xD;
      Illness Research and Training (PTCIB) Strategic Research and Training agenda, this study will&#xD;
      provide valuable data on the efficacy, preliminary effectiveness and potential for&#xD;
      implementation of an innovative, cost-effective, sustainable technology-enhanced intervention&#xD;
      designed to address the unique needs of adolescent injury patients and mitigate short- and&#xD;
      long-term impact of injury on mental health, quality of life, and overall well-being.&#xD;

      Pediatric traumatic injury (i.e., injury of sudden onset and severity requiring immediate&#xD;
      attention) is the leading cause of death and morbidity among US adolescents and are&#xD;
      associated with mental health and health risk outcomes. Pediatric traumatic injuries are&#xD;
      associated with medical and societal costs of $87 billion and elevates risk for a wide range&#xD;
      of health risk consequences that affect quality of life, physical recovery, social&#xD;
      functioning, and return to previous activities. The prevalence of PTSD and depression is high&#xD;
      among pediatric traumatic injury patients; however, most pediatric trauma centers don't have&#xD;
      the resources to implement models of care that address mental health following injury.&#xD;
      Current guidelines by the American College of Surgeons (ACS) Committee on Trauma strongly&#xD;
      recommend screening and addressing emotional recovery in traumatic injury patients. The ACS&#xD;
      Committee on Trauma has identified this as a priority and likely will begin to mandate mental&#xD;
      health programs in Level I and II pediatric trauma centers nationally. It is therefore&#xD;
      critical that policy and practice is guided by the implementation and evaluation of scalable&#xD;
      and sustainable models of care. In 2015 the investigators launched the Trauma Resilience and&#xD;
      Recovery Program (TRRP), a scalable and sustainable, technology-enhanced, multidisciplinary&#xD;
      stepped model of care - one of the few in the US - that provides early intervention and&#xD;
      direct services to improve access to evidence-based mental health care after traumatic injury&#xD;
      for children, adults and families. This model of care has been found to be feasible and&#xD;
      acceptable to adolescent patients (ages 12-17) at each level of service. TRRP includes 3&#xD;
      major steps: (1) in-hospital education, brief risk reduction session, and tracking patients'&#xD;
      emotional recovery via an automated text-messaging system, (2) conducting a 30-day screen via&#xD;
      telephone to identify patients who are good candidates for psychological treatment, and (3)&#xD;
      providing referral to best-practice telehealth-based or in-person assessment and treatment.&#xD;
      The investigators partnered with three accredited Level I and II pediatric trauma centers and&#xD;
      propose a multi-site hybrid 1 effectiveness-implementation trial with 300 adolescent (ages&#xD;
      12-17) traumatic injury patients to: 1) assess the extent to which TRRP promotes improvement&#xD;
      in quality of life and emotional recovery and 2) gather preliminary data on the potential for&#xD;
      TRRP to be implemented in other Level I trauma centers. Directly in line with NICHD's&#xD;
      Pediatric Trauma and Critical Illness Research and Training (PTCIB) Strategic Research and&#xD;
      Training agenda, this study will provide valuable data on the efficacy, preliminary&#xD;
      effectiveness and potential for implementation of an innovative, cost-effective, sustainable&#xD;
      technology-enhanced intervention designed to address the unique needs of adolescent injury&#xD;
      patients and mitigate short- and long-term impact of injury on mental health, quality of&#xD;
      life, and overall well-being.&#xD;

    <description>The CPSS is a 26-item measure to assess PTSD diagnostic criteria and severity in youth. Responses are assessed using a 4-point Likert scale and a cutoff score of 31 can be used for identifying a probable PTSD diagnosis in children.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, and 12-month post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 6-item well-validated screening scale for nonspecific distress that demonstrates solid psychometric properties. Responses are assessed on a 5-point Likert scale and scores 13 or higher are suggestive of severe mental illness.</description>

    <measure>Peritraumatic Distress Inventory (PDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 13-item measure with strong psychometric properties used to assess distress at the time of injury. Responses are on a 4-point Likert scale and scores above 15 are suggestive of peritraumatic distress. This measure has been validated with child traumatic injury survivors.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Injured Trauma Survivor Screen (ITSS)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 9-item measure used to assess risk for development of posttraumatic stress symptoms following injury. Responses are in Yes/No format and a score of 2 on the PTSD questions suggest higher risk of developing PTSD and a score of 2 or more on the depression questions indicate higher risk for development of depression.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test-Consumption (AUDIT-C)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 3, 6, and 12-month post-baseline assessment</time_frame>
    <description>This is a 3-item validated screen that identifies hazardous drinkers. The AUDIT-C is scored on a scale of 0-12 (scores of 0 reflect no alcohol use). In men, a score of 4 or more is considered positive; in women, a score of 3 or more is considered positive. Generally, the higher the AUDIT-C score, the more likely it is that the patient's drinking is affecting his/her health and safety.</description>
