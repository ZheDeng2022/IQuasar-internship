  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that elevated nighttime blood pressure (BP) was more closely&#xD;
      associated with cardiovascular mortality and morbidity than daytime and clinic BPs. With&#xD;
      increasingly advanced technology, not only 24-hour ambulatory but also home BP monitors can&#xD;
      be used to evaluate nighttime BP. The validation study of the Omron HEM 9601T showed that the&#xD;
      wrist-type home BP monitor could be a suitable and reliable tool for the diagnosis and&#xD;
      management of nocturnal hypertension. However, up to now, there is no data on home nighttime&#xD;
      BP in Chinese patients and it is unclear if different dosing time would reduce ambulatory and&#xD;
      home nighttime BPs differently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators therefore designed a multicenter randomized clinical trial to compare&#xD;
      between morning dosing and bedtime dosing of antihypertensive medications in the difference&#xD;
      in nighttime, daytime and the 24-h BP reductions evaluated by both ambulatory and home BP&#xD;
      monitoring, and in target organ protections.&#xD;
