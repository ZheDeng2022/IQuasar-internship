      This protocol delineates a randomized controlled trial for evaluating the implementation and&#xD;
      clinical effectiveness of Assecet, a digital peer support intervention for youth mental&#xD;
      well-being, which comprises two components. The digital peer support training curriculum aims&#xD;
      to equip youth befrienders (i.e., peers who provide support) with knowledge and skills in&#xD;
      harnessing four active ingredients of youth mental well-being-specifically, Mattering,&#xD;
      selfhood, compassion, and mindfulness, in providing effective peer support for seekers (peers&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Background: The burgeoning mental health issues among emerging adults (ages 19 to 25)&#xD;
      worldwide has fuelled concerns about youths' widespread experiences of emotional distress,&#xD;
      specifically concerning anxiety and depression, and coping mechanisms. Digital peer support&#xD;
      intervention has demonstrated varying degrees of clinical effectiveness for positive health&#xD;
      and psychological outcomes across different developmental stages. The onset of the COVID-19&#xD;
      pandemic has resulted in prolonged isolation and reduced social connections, and emerging&#xD;
      literature is amounting to the import of digital peer emotional disclosure and support for&#xD;
      young people psychological well-being. However, much remains to be explored regarding&#xD;
      implementation and clinical effectiveness-how best to conduct digital peer intervention in&#xD;
      support of youths' psychological well-being, and the associated mechanism of change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: This protocol delineates a randomized controlled trial for evaluating the&#xD;
      implementation and clinical effectiveness of Assecet, a digital peer support intervention for&#xD;
      youth mental well-being, which comprises two components. The digital peer support training&#xD;
      curriculum aims to equip youth befrienders (i.e., peers who provide support) with knowledge&#xD;
      and skills in harnessing four active ingredients of youth mental well-being-specifically,&#xD;
      Mattering, selfhood, compassion, and mindfulness, in providing effective peer support for&#xD;
      seekers (peers who seek support). The Acceset intervention that involves three&#xD;
      components-digital biomarkers of psychological well-being, peer emotional disclosure process&#xD;
      and community engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants will consist of 100 students ages 19 to 25 from the National University&#xD;
      of Singapore to engage with the Acceset platform. At the time of recruitment, individuals&#xD;
      will be screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria based on self-reporting. The qualified&#xD;
      participants (seekers) will be randomly allocated into two arms. Arm 1 (n = 50) seekers will&#xD;
      engage with the Acceset platform for a period of 3 weeks, together with befrienders (n = 30)&#xD;
      and moderators (n = 30). Arm 2 (n = 50) a control group will be placed on a waitlist for&#xD;
      Acceset intervention. These individuals will be age and gender matched with the intervention&#xD;
      group (i.e., arm 1). Their mental well-being, as well as their help seeking behavior, at the&#xD;
      same time points and via the same questionnaire battery will be compared with those in arm 1.&#xD;
      Both seekers and befrienders will be monitored using a questionnaire battery listed&#xD;
      (including help seeking behaviors beyond the Acceset platform) at 4 time points: baseline&#xD;
      (before the intervention), 3 weeks (the end of the intervention), 6 weeks and 9 weeks (to&#xD;
      measure carry over effects). The implementation outcomes will be adoption and fidelity&#xD;
      evaluation of the digital peer support training curriculum, the feasibility and acceptability&#xD;
      of Acceset in providing continuous access to online peer support throughout the duration of&#xD;
      the seekers' engagement. The clinical outcomes will include Mattering, self-hood, compassion,&#xD;
      mindfulness, psychological well-being scores for befrienders and seekers, and additionally&#xD;
      perceived social support for seekers. The mechanism of change linking befrienders' support&#xD;
      and seekers' mental well-being will be assessed using latent growth curve modelling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection, Management and Analyses: We conducted power analysis to ascertain the&#xD;
      adequate sample size needed for the randomized controlled trial, specifically in comparing&#xD;
      the intervention and control groups on different clinical outcomes, so that the study has&#xD;
      sufficient power to detect valid effects. The study sample size of n = 50 for intervention&#xD;
      and n = 50 for control is needed because of multiple dependent variables measuring clinical&#xD;
      outcomes included in the study and the testing of implementation outcomes (i.e., feasibility,&#xD;
      utility). In dealing with missing data, we will first determine if missing data is missing&#xD;
      completely at random (MCAR). If missing data is not systematic, as indicated by the&#xD;
      non-significant result from Little's Missing Completely at Random Test, this study will&#xD;
      handle missing data using full information maximum likelihood imputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be analyzed and interpreted through three means. First, independent sample t-tests&#xD;
      will be conducted whenever we need to compare intervention vs. control group on the different&#xD;
      clinical outcomes in this study. Second, to elucidate the content of emotional disclosure on&#xD;
      the Acceset platform, particularly in relation to the four active ingredients of&#xD;
      psychological well-being (i.e., Mattering, self-hood, compassion and mindfulness), we will&#xD;
      perform topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analyses with R to filter the&#xD;
      huge amount of data available and drill down relevant themes and topics. LDA is an advanced&#xD;
      statistical method that increases precision and accuracy in coding as compared to the&#xD;
      exclusive use of qualitative approach /analyses. Third, to compare the mechanism of change ,&#xD;
      we will use Latent Growth Curve Modelling (LCM) to examine the trajectories of Acceset&#xD;
      intervention in predicting the change in clinical outcomes experienced by youths. LCM&#xD;
      elucidates whether an increasing trend in befrienders' digital peer support predicts&#xD;
      increasing trends in youths' sense of Mattering, self-hood, compassion, mindfulness, and&#xD;
      psychological well-being (i.e., clinical outcomes).&#xD;
