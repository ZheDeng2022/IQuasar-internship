  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the phase 1 trial is to identify a dose of topotecan that will be&#xD;
      safe to take forward into a Phase 2 trial, with no unexpected toxicities or drug-drug&#xD;
      interactions with standard therapy for COVID-19. The investigators hypothesise that a single&#xD;
      dose of low-dose Topotecan will blunt the expression of inflammatory genes in patients with&#xD;
      moderate COVID-19, without cytotoxic side effects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      4 fixed dosing levels (0.25 -0.5mg) of Topotecan will be evaluated in this trial, using&#xD;
      sub-cytotoxic doses of Topotecan which are well below typical chemotherapy levels and shown&#xD;
      not to cause myelosuppression in previously tested populations. The dose escalation will be&#xD;
      in a standard 3+3 dose escalation design with 0.25 mg increments of Topotecan. The study aims&#xD;
      to establish the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D) of Topotecan in hypoxic patients with&#xD;
      moderate to severe COVID-19.The RP2D is defined as the maximum safe dose at which 3 or more&#xD;
      patients are found to have clinically relevant concentrations of Topotecan in the blood&#xD;
      stream, without reaching anti-cancer concentrations in plasma (defined as Area under the&#xD;
      curve (AUC)&gt;150000) and without causing Grade 2/3/4 neutropenia (CTCAE5).&#xD;
