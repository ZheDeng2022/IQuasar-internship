      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Acute on Chronic Liver Failure (ACLF) is a relatively new entity, characterized by&#xD;
      complications of cirrhosis and high rate of organ failures. Short term mortality at 28 days&#xD;
      is high (&gt;15%). ACLF is multifactorial in its etiology and there is no consensus about the&#xD;
      definitions between different parts of the world. The Asian Pacific Association for the Study&#xD;
      of the Liver (APASL) consensus defines ACLF as &quot;Acute hepatic insult manifesting as jaundice&#xD;
      (serum bilirubin ≥ 5mg/dl and coagulopathy (INR≥1.5 or prothrombin activity &lt;40% complicated&#xD;
      within 4 weeks by clinical ascites and/or encephalopathy in a patient with previously&#xD;
      diagnosed or undiagnosed chronic liver disease or cirrhosis, and is associated with a high&#xD;
      28-day day mortality. Another definition of ACLF defines it as &quot;an acute deterioration of&#xD;
      pre-existing chronic liver disease, usually related to a precipitating event and associated&#xD;
      with increased mortality at 3 months due to multi-system organ failure&quot;. This definition also&#xD;
      includes a high mortality at 28 days and organ failures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Events known to precipitate ACLF include Acute alcoholic hepatitis, acute hepatotrophic viral&#xD;
      infections , reactivation of hepatitis B virus infection, Drug induced liver injury (DILI),&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal bleeding, sepsis, ischemia to the liver and portal vein thrombosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An enhanced pro-inflammatory cytokine environment has been shown to be present in ACLF. These&#xD;
      are chronically primed neutrophils which are energy depleted and unable to carry out the&#xD;
      phagocytosis function, leading to a functional failure in combating infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cytokines also play a key role in the pathogenesis of the inflammatory response. Elevated&#xD;
      serum levels of TNF-α, sTNF-αR1, sTNF-αR2, interleukin (IL)-2, IL-2R, IL-4, IL-6, IL-6,IL-8,&#xD;
      IL-10 and interferon-γ have been described. Raised levels of these pro-inflammatory cytokines&#xD;
      can be due to necrotic liver cells, reduced clearance by the liver or most importantly, from&#xD;
      activation of toll-like receptors (TLRs). These receptors activate Kupffer cells (KCs), which&#xD;
      play a key role I the pathogenesis of liver injury by activating signaling cascades,&#xD;
      transcription of pro-inflammatory cytokines and super oxide agents. The resulting oxidative&#xD;
      stress releases proteolytic enzymes and vasoactive substances like endothelin-1 (ET-1),&#xD;
      thromboxane A2, nitric oxide (NO), and prostaglandins which lead to microcirculatory&#xD;
      dysfunction. The entire cascade ultimately results in hepatocyte death and liver dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reactive oxygen species (ROS) released by kupffer cells activate hepatic stellate cells&#xD;
      (HSCs) leading to increased synthesis of extracellular matrix (ECM). Oxidative stress (OS)&#xD;
      leads to worsening inflammation, focal and zonal necrosis in the liver and thus architectural&#xD;
      distortion. Several studies relating to liver diseases indicate an over production of ROS&#xD;
      and/or reduction of hepatic Gutathione (GSH) which is the most abundant cellular&#xD;
      anti-oxidant, which exhibits numerous and versatile functions and therefore protects cells&#xD;
      against toxicity regardless of etiology of disease. N-Acetyle cystein (NAC) has an optimal&#xD;
      thiol redox state, which helps protective ability of the cell to counter balance OS and&#xD;
      inflammation. NAC has been used in a variety of clinical conditions, such as inflammatory&#xD;
      bowel disease, pulmonary diseases, cystic fibrosis, septic shock and aceto-aminophen and&#xD;
      non-aceto-aminophen induced acute liver failure (ALF). Moreover, it has also been found to&#xD;
      improve liver blood flow and liver function in septic shock and non-alcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial design The study is a randomized double blind placebo controlled pilot trial. Study&#xD;
