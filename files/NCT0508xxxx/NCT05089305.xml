  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk for the development of complications from COVID-19 occurs mainly in patients over 65&#xD;
      years of age, with obesity, arterial hypertension, chronic lung diseases and&#xD;
      immunosuppression states. Since the persistence of radiological imaging correlates with&#xD;
      physiological deterioration, these patients are likely to be at increased risk of parenchymal&#xD;
      lung disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is known that the administration of Ozone, in any of the three phases of COVID-19&#xD;
      infection, is useful in the management of acute disease, both for its viricidal and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory activity, however, in the convalescence stage when the persistence of&#xD;
      sequelae that can severely affect the quality of life of patients is identified.&#xD;

      The objective of this study is to evaluate whether the administration by inhalation of ozone&#xD;
      plasma favorably modifies lung function and inflammatory parameters in patients with&#xD;
      pulmonary sequelae associated with coronavirus 19 infection (SARS-COV-2). We will conduct an&#xD;
      open-ended, uncontrolled clinical trial in 35 male and female patients, between 25-80 years&#xD;
      of age with previous confirmed diagnosis of COVID-19 infection with negative nasopharyngeal&#xD;
      polymerase chain reaction assay (PCR) test and without active disease, patients will also&#xD;
      continue with their usual treatment. Clinical findings and laboratory and cabinet tests&#xD;
      include a basal and 14-day metabolic and inflammatory profile, body weight, body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI) and blood pressure will be determined during the initial and final visit, as well as&#xD;
      respiratory parameters by pulmonary function tests (spirometry, TLCo) and performing the 6&#xD;
      min walk test in endless band with pre- and post-walk oximetry measurements at the beginning&#xD;
      and end of the study. Adverse events to treatment will be documented. Statistical analysis:&#xD;
      Mann-Whitney U test and Wilcoxon exact test. A p &lt;0.05 shall be considered statistically&#xD;
      significant.&#xD;
