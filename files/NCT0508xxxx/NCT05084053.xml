  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim of the study is to check for side effects from TAK-771, and to check how well&#xD;
      TAK-771 controls symptoms in Japanese participants with chronic inflammatory demyelinating&#xD;
      polyradiculoneuropathy (CIDP) and multifocal motor neuropathy (MMN)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be treated with TAK-771 for 45 months as a maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be many clinic visits. The number of visits will depend on the infusion cycles of&#xD;
      study drug (every 2, 3, or 4 weeks).&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 Months</time_frame>
    <description>Relapse is defined as worsening of functional disability defined as an increase of &gt;=1 point relative to the pre-subcutaneous (pre-SC) treatment baseline score in adjusted Inflammatory Neuropathy Cause and Treatment (INCAT) disability score. The INCAT disability scale is the most widely used assessment tool to measure the functional activity level of patients with CIDP. The INCAT disability scale consists of upper and lower extremity components, with a maximum of 5 points for the upper extremities (arm disability) and a maximum of 5 points for the lower extremities (leg disability), which are summed for an overall INCAT disability score ranging from 0 to 10 points, where 0 is normal and 10 is severely incapacitated. An adjusted INCAT disability score is the same as the INCAT disability score, with the only exception in the exclusion of changes from 0 (normal) to 1 (minor symptoms) (or vice versa) in upper limb function.</description>

    <description>The MRC sum score will serve as a measure of muscle strength. The following muscles on each side of the body are examined and the strength of each muscle is rated according to the MRC scale: deltoids, biceps, wrist extensors, iliopsoas, quadriceps, and anterior tibialis. The MRC scale ranges from 0 to 5, where: 0 = no visible contraction; 1 = visible contraction without movement of the limb; 2 = movement of the limb but not against gravity; 3 = movement against gravity over (almost) the full range; 4 = movement against gravity and resistance; and, 5 = normal. All scores from both left and right side of the body are summed to obtain the MRC sum score. The MRC sum score ranges from 0 (paralysis) to 60 (normal strength).</description>

    <description>Guy's Neurological Disability Scale is a questionnaire which consists of 12 separate categories (4 to 8 questions per category). The categories include: cognition, mood, vision, speech, swallowing, upper limb function, lower limb function, bladder function, bowel function, sexual function, fatigue, and others. In the current study, only 2 categories; upper limb function and the lower limb function will be used for assessment of the disability of participants with MMN. The severity of each subscale is graded from 0 (normal function) to 5 (total loss of function) based according to severity and impact on the individual.</description>
