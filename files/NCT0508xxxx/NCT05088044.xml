  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study nurses will be taught regarding Modified Early Warning Score and how to mark&#xD;
      the involved physiological parameters in the MEWS chart and then scoring will be given i.e&#xD;
      MEWS score and according to the score intervention would be taken by nurses by communicating&#xD;
      with other health team members. this scoring will allow nurses to assess early deterioration&#xD;
      and early ICU admission and at last nurses will be asked regarding the barriers or&#xD;
      facilitators they faced while performing MEWS score.&#xD;

      in this study the objective are to 1. assess the impact of MEWS on the competency and&#xD;
      self-efficacy of nurses before and after implementing MEWS. 2. to assess barriers and&#xD;
      facilitators that are seen in implementing MEWS. 3. to assess the association between impact&#xD;
      of MEWS after implementing MEWS with selected socio-demographic variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      so, sampling technique used will be total enumeration( nurses of general, semi-private and&#xD;
      private ward i.e appox 82) after fulfilling inclusion and exclusion criteria, the pre-test&#xD;
      would be of selected nurses after that intervention would be given then after 7 days&#xD;
      post-test would be conducted and after that collected data will be analyzed using descriptive&#xD;
      and inferential statistics.&#xD;
