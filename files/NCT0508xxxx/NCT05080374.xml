      Introduction: Nonspecific low back pain is the most common cause of visits to medical&#xD;
      personnel and is the largest cause of absenteeism in the world. (1), Nonspecific low back&#xD;
      pain accounts for 85% of low back pain, notably affecting quality of life and working life&#xD;
      (2), There is a 50-70% probability that a person will have low back pain during their life (&#xD;
      3), lumbago produces 300,000 years lived with disability (ADL), being the first burden of&#xD;
      disease in Chile, surpassing hypertensive heart disease and depression (4). There are many&#xD;
      therapeutic approaches to the management of nonspecific low back pain, including high-speed,&#xD;
      low-amplitude spinal manipulations (5). This technique consists of applying a short and rapid&#xD;
      force at the level of the joint that is restricted, in order to restore normal joint&#xD;
      mobility. The physiological effects of manipulations are not sufficiently studied, but some&#xD;
      authors (6) (7) suggest that the nervous system is the mediator of the effects of spinal&#xD;
      manipulation. Among non-pharmacological interventions, numerous clinical guidelines recommend&#xD;
      the use of therapeutic exercise for low back pain (8), including a wide variety of types of&#xD;
      recommended exercises, the most traditionally recommended being aerobic exercises, exercises&#xD;
      that involve stretching postures of the back. vertebral musculature, strengthening and&#xD;
      strength exercises (9) and central stabilization exercises (10). Recently, the effects of&#xD;
      inspiratory muscle and diaphragm training exercises in patients with low back pain are being&#xD;
      investigated (11). The application of an elastic bandage (12) in the lumbar area generates a&#xD;
      proprioceptive signal through the skin, producing analgesia and a feeling of support in the&#xD;
      area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: To compare the effects of different therapeutic approaches in combination with&#xD;
      spinal manipulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and method: Single-blind randomized clinical trial Results: Significant differences&#xD;
      are expected before and after treatment and differences between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The aims of this study is to demonstrate that High speed and low amplitude spinal&#xD;
      manipulation plus other conservative treatment is a valid therapeutic strategy for the&#xD;
      management of nonspecific low back pain&#xD;
