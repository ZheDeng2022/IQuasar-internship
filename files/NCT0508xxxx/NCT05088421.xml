      This Phase 1 study is designed to assess the safety, tolerabilty and pharmcokinetics of&#xD;
      single and multiple intravenous doses of BWC0977 when administered to healthy adult&#xD;
      volunteers. This is a randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled, ascending dose,&#xD;
      multi-cohort trial. A total of 64 healthy volunteers are expected to be enrolled into 8&#xD;
      Cohorts. The study will be conducted in two phases: A single ascending dose (SAD) phase,&#xD;
      followed by a multiple ascending dose (MAD) phase. In SAD, participants in Cohorts 1 - 5 will&#xD;
      receive one dose of BWC0977 or placebo. In MAD, participants in Cohorts 6 - 8 will receive&#xD;
      multiple doses of BWC0977 or placebo for 10 consecutive days at a dose deemed safe and&#xD;
      tolerable as determined in the preceding SAD Cohorts. In both parts sequential cohorts will&#xD;
      be exposed to increasing doses of BWC0977.&#xD;
