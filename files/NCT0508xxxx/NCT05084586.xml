    <textblock>
      In this study, the local and systemic side effects, tumor recurrens and progression rates of&#xD;
      single or continuous epirubicin instillation during the early postoperative period were&#xD;
      investigated in low and intermediate risk non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Bladder cancer (BC) is the seventh most commonly diagnosed cancer in the male population&#xD;
      worldwide, while it drops to tenth when both genders are considered. Worldwide, the BC&#xD;
      age-standardised mortality rate (per 100,000 person/years) was 3.3 for men vs. 0.86 for&#xD;
      women.It is more common, especially in developed countries. NMIBC are divided into four&#xD;
      groups as low-medium-high and very high risk according to EORTC (European Organization for&#xD;
      Research and Treatment of Cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epirubicin is an anthracycline drug used for chemotherapy. Immediate single instillation of&#xD;
      epirubicin has been shown to act by destroying circulating tumour cells after&#xD;
      TURB(Transurethral Resection of a Bladder Tumor), and by an ablative effect on residual&#xD;
      tumour cells at the resection site and on small overlooked tumours.European Association of&#xD;
      Urology Guidelines on Bladder Cancer advocates single immediate postoperative intravesical&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Early single-dose instillation of epirubicin immediately after transurethral&#xD;
      resection was shown to improve recurrence rates in low and intermediate risk groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediate single instillation of epirubicin into the bladder can induce an array of&#xD;
      irritative voiding symptoms including dysuria, frequency, urgency, suprapubic discomfort,&#xD;
      hematuria and pelvic pain. In some cases, patients cannot tolerate these symptoms and may&#xD;
      necessitate removal of chemotherapeutic agent for alleviation. Incomplete instillation leads&#xD;
      to an increase in recurrence and progression rates. In this study, continuous infusion of&#xD;
      epirubicin into the bladder and instillation of a single dose epirubicin will be evaluated in&#xD;
      terms of side effects, tumor recurrence and progression rates.&#xD;
