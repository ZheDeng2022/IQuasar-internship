  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Organ procurement organizations (OPO) have increased organ recovery efficiency and yield and&#xD;
      have also reduced organ acquisition charges. The new liver allocation policy came into effect&#xD;
      in February 2020 and aims to increase access to organs for waitlist candidates with the&#xD;
      greatest severity of illness. The urgent change was driven by the perception that patients&#xD;
      were dying because of arbitrary boundaries and inequitable access. Critics of the new policy&#xD;
      have highlighted the potential cost implications particularly at an OPO level. A study of&#xD;
      five OPOs throughout the United States highlighted an increase in costs ranging from 43% -&#xD;
      206% despite the same volume of livers transplanted. The main reason for the cost appears to&#xD;
      lie in organ handling and transport. This mirrors the findings of Puri and colleagues who&#xD;
      acknowledged changes to lung transplantation at Barnes Jewish Hospital in the pre- and&#xD;
      post-policy eras and reported a substantial decline in local donors. The new lung system has&#xD;
      also resulted in a higher organ discard rate and ultimately higher costs. Such data has&#xD;
      generated meaningful discussions regarding optimizing organ allocation polices, however, data&#xD;
      from individual transplant centers is lacking in the literature. Changes at a transplant&#xD;
      center level relating to recipient costs are likely impacted by the new policy, which could&#xD;
      be related to patient travel, accommodation, work up etc.&#xD;
