      This is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of APT-1011, followed by an&#xD;
      open-label extension (OLE) in adolescents (≥12 to &lt;18 years) with EoE that will evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy and safety of APT-1011 3 mg administered HS for the induction of response to&#xD;
      treatment (histologic and symptomatic) over 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 12, subjects may move into the open-label single arm study of APT-1011 3 mg HS. All&#xD;
      subjects who do not move into the open-label study will return at Week 14 for a 2-week&#xD;
      off-treatment follow-up.&#xD;

&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis or presumptive diagnosis of EoE that is confirmed during the Screening&#xD;
             period by histology that demonstrates ≥15 peak eos/HPF. In order to ensure that a&#xD;
             diagnosis can be made, at least 6 biopsies should be taken from both proximal and&#xD;
             distal specimens (at least 3 each). Mid-esophageal biopsies are not required&#xD;
             (optional). HPF will be defined as a standard area of 235 square microns in a&#xD;

&#xD;
               1. Esophagogastroduodenoscopies and biopsies are to be obtained during the Screening&#xD;

             abnormality that in the Investigator's judgment might interfere with study procedures&#xD;
             or the ability of the subject to adhere to and complete the study or increase the&#xD;
             safety risk to the subject such as uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension or may&#xD;
             increase risk of corticosteroid toxicity (e.g., abnormal bone mineral density)&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. History of recurrent (persistent) or current oral or esophageal mucosal infection due&#xD;
