  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a multicentre, open-label phase II dose-finding clinical trial that will&#xD;
      recruit approximately 120 female subjects undergoing COH for in vitro fertilization (IVF) or&#xD;
      intracytoplasmic single sperm injection (ICSI). We set up three SHR7280 tablets dose groups&#xD;
      of 300 mg BID, 200 mg BID, and 200 mg QD with 40 subjects in each group, besides, a group of&#xD;
      400mg bid is set as an alternative.&#xD;
