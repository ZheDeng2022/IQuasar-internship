  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sacroiliac pain is a huge problem in women during pregnancy and postpartum period. Muscle&#xD;
      energy technique has potential effect in decreasing the pain and disability&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A sample of forty women diagnosed with postpartum sacroiliac dysfunction, their ages ranged&#xD;
      from 20 to 40 years and their BMI was ranged from 25-30 kg / m2 participated in this study,&#xD;
      they were selected and divided randomly into 2 equal groups (A&amp;B). Group (A) (Control group):&#xD;
      consisted of 20 patients, they received muscle energy technique for 12 sessions, 3 sessions /&#xD;
      week. Group (B) (Study group): consisted of 20 patients, they received alternative heat and&#xD;
      ice for another 20 minutes /session (10 minutes for each). All patients in both group were&#xD;
      evaluated at the beginning of the study and after 12 sessions through measuring pain&#xD;
      intensity using visual analog scale and disability using oswestry disability index (ODI)&#xD;

    <description>It was used for determining pain intensity before and after the treatment course for each patients in both groups (A&amp;B). Visual analogue scale is a-10 centimeters line, at one end was written (no pain = zero) and at the other end was written (worst pain the patient ever felt = 10)</description>

    <measure>Oswestry disability index</measure>
    <time_frame>4 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The self-completed questionnaire contains ten topics concerning intensity of pain, lifting, ability to care for oneself, ability to walk, ability to sit, sexual function, ability to stand, social life, sleep quality, and Each question is scored on a scale of 0-5 with the first statement being zero and indicating the least amount of disability and the last statement is scored 5 indicating most severe disability. The scores for all questions answered are summed, were used to measure the level of disability before and after treatment</description>
