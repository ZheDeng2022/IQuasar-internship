      To evaluate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of intrathecal (IT) OAV101 in treatment&#xD;
      naive patients with Type 2 spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) who are ≥ 2 to &lt; 18 years of age&#xD;
      over a 15 month trial duration.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, randomized, sham-controlled, double-blind study to investigate the&#xD;
      safety, tolerability, and efficacy of IT OAV101 in SMA participants, sitting and never&#xD;
      ambulatory. The study will enroll treatment naive Type 2 SMA participants who are ≥ 2 years&#xD;
      to &lt; 18 years who harbor biallelic SMN1 pathogenic variants in SMN1 and 2-4 copies of SMN2.&#xD;
      The study consists of a Screening and a Baseline Period followed by a Treatment Period 1 and&#xD;
      Follow-up Period 1 (total of 52 weeks) and a Treatment and Follow-up Period 2 (total of 12&#xD;
      weeks). The total trial duration period is 64 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a standard screening period that will last 45 to 60 days, during which&#xD;
      eligibility will be assessed and baseline assessments will be performed prior to treatment.&#xD;
      Participants who meet eligibility criteria at screening and baseline visits will be&#xD;
      randomized in a 3:2 ratio to receive OAV101 by lumbar intrathecal injection or to receive a&#xD;
      sham procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Period 1 consists of OAV101/sham administration with in-patient hospitalization on&#xD;
      Study Day 1, Day 2 and Day 3 (optional). Treatment Period 1 is followed by a 52-week&#xD;
      out-patient Follow-Up Period 1 for safety and efficacy assessments .&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time point each participant completes Follow-up Period 1, those who are eligible will&#xD;
      subsequently enter into Treatment Period 2. Entry into Treatment Period 2 will occur&#xD;
      immediately after each participant completes their participation in Follow-up Period 1. In&#xD;
      Treatment Period 2, eligible participants who received a sham procedure on Study Day 1 of&#xD;
      Treatment Period 1 will be hospitalized to receive OAV101 and participants who received&#xD;
      OAV101 on Study Day 1 of Treatment Period 1 will be hospitalized to receive a sham procedure&#xD;
      on Week 52 +1 Day. A sham procedure is a skin prick in the lumbar region without any&#xD;
      medication. In-patient observation will continue on Week 52 +2 Days and Week 52 +3 Days&#xD;
      (optional). Treatment Period 2 is followed by a 12-week follow-up period for safety and&#xD;
      efficacy assessments. Blinding is maintained for all patients during both Treatment Period 1&#xD;
      and 2. At the end of the study all participants will be eligible to enroll in a long-term&#xD;
      follow-up study (15 years) to monitor long-term safety and efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study, participants will complete visits as defined in the Schedule of&#xD;
      Assessments. Prednisolone treatment will be given per study protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety monitoring will be performed as per study schedule and protocol requirements. Safety&#xD;
      for the participants enrolled in the study will be evaluated by a designated group of&#xD;
      unblinded study team members together with the Data Monitoring (DMC) as described in the&#xD;
      charter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be performed after all participants have completed Week 52 or&#xD;
      discontinued prior to Week 52. A final analysis will be performed after all participants have&#xD;
      completed Week 52 (or discontinued prior to Week 64).&#xD;

    <description>The HFMSE is a validated SMA specific assessment devised for use in children with SMA to give objective information on motor ability and clinical progression. The HFMSE contains 33 items rated from 0 (unable to perform) to 2 (performs without modification/adaptation/compensation). Total scores range from 0-66. Higher scores indicate higher levels of motor ability.</description>

    <description>An adverse event (AE) is any untoward medical occurrence (e.g. any unfavorable and unintended sign [including abnormal laboratory findings], symptom or disease) in a clinical investigation participant after providing written informed consent for participation in the study.&#xD;
A Treatment Emergent Adverse Event (TEAE) is defined as an event that emerges during treatment, having been absent pretreatment, or worsens relative to the pretreatment state.&#xD;
The occurrence of AEs must be sought by non-directive questioning of the participant at each visit during the study. Adverse events also may be detected when they are volunteered by the participant during or between visits or through physical examination findings, laboratory test findings, or other assessments.</description>
