    <textblock>
      This study aim to analyze cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted surgery compared to open&#xD;
      surgery for partial nephrectomy in the context of renal tumor. A total of 400 patients were&#xD;
      recruited in two centers in France corresponding to Reims(n=200) and Nancy hospital center&#xD;
      (n=200). Patients recruited in Reims are corresponding to open surgery strategy, while&#xD;
      patients of Nancy center are corresponding to robot-assisted surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Costs analyzed included cost of intervention, hospital stay and complications. Effectiveness&#xD;
      measure is corresponding to the rate of patients without acute complication at one year.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The main objective of this study is to analyze cost-effectiveness of robot-assisted surgery&#xD;
      compared to open surgery in the context of partial nephrectomy for renal tumor. Many studies&#xD;
      demonstrated a better post-operative outcome with robot-assisted surgery mainly in terms of&#xD;
      lower rate of complications. Results in terms of oncologic outcomes were equivalent. However,&#xD;
      no study in France has analyzed the economic incentives of implementing robot-assisted&#xD;
      surgery in the context of partial nephrectomy. It is very likely that the higher cost of&#xD;
      robot-assisted surgery could be offset by a lower cost of post-operatives complications. The&#xD;
      secondary purpose of this study is to analyze difference between robot-assisted and open&#xD;
      surgery procedures in terms of operative time, hospital stay duration and rate of minor&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is based on a retrospective cohort of 400 patients. Half of patients (N=200) were&#xD;
      recruited in Nancy hospital center and are corresponding to the robot-assisted surgery&#xD;
      procedure. The other half is corresponding to open surgery arm and where recruited in Reims&#xD;
      hospital center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria refer concerns patients over 18 years that were operated for minor renal&#xD;
      tumor in Nancy and Reims hospital center. Patients operated for total nephrectomy were&#xD;
      excluded from the analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected refers to the cost and effectiveness of the two compared procedures. Cost data&#xD;
      are issued from hospital records and included the cost of hospital stay, surgical&#xD;
      intervention and potential complications. Data related to effectiveness are obtained from&#xD;
      patients medical records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cost-effectiveness analysis will be conducted to estimate the cost per one averted case of&#xD;
      post-operative complication at one year. This consists on calculating the incremental&#xD;
      cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER). Sensitivity analysis will be also conducted in order to&#xD;
      estimate de confidence interval for the ICER.&#xD;

    <description>Robot-assisted partial nephrectomy (RAPN) is considered as a feasible minimally invasive alternative to open partial nephrectomy (OPN) for the surgical treatment of renal tumors. The main advantages of this technique include a three-dimensional magnified view of the surgical field, enhanced dexterity, and greater precision in both dissection and reconstruction.</description>
