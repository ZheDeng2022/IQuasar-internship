    <textblock>
      Chronic low back pain (CLBP) is a common condition that causes tremendous health and&#xD;
      socio-economic problems. CLBP is a widespread problem. About 70%-80% of adults in the general&#xD;
      population are expected to suffer at least a low back pain episode at some time in their&#xD;
      lives1. CLBP is the leading cause of absenteeism at work and creates restrictions on&#xD;
      movements, lasting disabilities, and impaired quality of life. Non-specific low back pain is&#xD;
      described as low back discomfort, which cannot be attributed to a distinct, known etiology&#xD;
      &quot;(e.g., infection, tumors, osteoporosis, fracture, structural deformity, inflammatory&#xD;
      disorder, radicular syndrome, or cauda equina syndrome)&quot; 2. Non-specific low back pain is a&#xD;
      mechanical musculoskeletal pain that has a symptom that varies according to the physical&#xD;
      activity nature 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The practice of sitting with a healthy posture and preventing a protracted-standing position&#xD;
      can often prevent simple low back pain. However, many kinds of low back pain are addressed&#xD;
      with therapies as numerous as the causes of low back pain. The most important treatments are&#xD;
      therapeutic measures, such as bed rest, assistive aids, traction therapy, heat, electrical&#xD;
      stimulation, and manual therapy are the first choice treatments4. If these methods fails,&#xD;
      invasive therapy procedures like nerve roots blocks and epidural injections are employed, and&#xD;
      operations are carried out when no reaction to other treatments has been seen or if the&#xD;
      disease status is critical. New conservative therapies, including extracorporeal shock wave&#xD;
      therapy (ESWT), have recently been embraced 5.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>McGill Pain Questionnaire for pain assessment</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>The quality and degree of subjective pain are evaluated. The scale comprises 4 subscales examining the sensory, affective, assessment, and other components of pain, pain-intensity responses, and a 5point scale (Present Pain Intensity)</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Roland Morris Disability Questionnaire (RMDQ)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 hour</time_frame>
    <description>is a reliable, valid tool for LBP dysfunction assessment. It is one of the more often used measures to evaluate LBP patients' functional state. The RMDQ comprises 24 elements in the LBP-adapted Sickness Impact Profile. The questionnaire was scored by summing the number of 'yes' ranged from 0 (no disability) to 24, were added to the questionnaire (severe disabilities) 12.</description>
