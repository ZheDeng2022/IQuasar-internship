  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      PHEOCHROMOCYTOMA (PCC)/ PARAGANGLIOMA are catecholamine secreting tumors with varied&#xD;
      manifestations. Besides hypertension, PCC patients may have subclinical to overt cardiac and&#xD;
      vascular dysfunction, which are important to recognize to minimize perioperative morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. Cardiovascular (CV) dysfunction can be in the form of hypertension, left&#xD;
      ventricular (LV) hypertrophy, heart failure, cardiomyopathy, dysrhythmias, angina and&#xD;
      Myocardial infarction. Literature search revealed a few retrospective and a few prospective&#xD;
      studies, including one prospective follow up study conducted at SGPGIMS to document CV&#xD;
      changes in PCC. Our institutional study was the first to document the nature and extent of CV&#xD;
      dysfunction and cardiomyopathy and their reversal after surgical cure. The studies revealed&#xD;
      that PCC patients had significantly higher LV mass index, higher LV diastolic dysfunction,&#xD;
      subclinical impaired LV systolic function. Earlier studies postulated apparent improvement in&#xD;
      various cardiac indices even with selective α-blockade and continued after surgical cure,&#xD;
      with near normalization at 3 -6 months postoperatively. Detailed cardiac and vascular&#xD;
      evaluation in PCC patients can be of help in preoperative optimization of cardiac risk and&#xD;
      may provide prognostic information The literature on PCC-mediated CV dysfunction and&#xD;
      catecholamine cardiomyopathy is largely limited to case reports and retrospective studies,&#xD;
      with few reports of their reversal after curative PCC operations. Whether the duration of&#xD;
      disease influence the function of heart was not apparently addressed in earlier trials.&#xD;
      Trials that established the differences in the degree of cardiac dysfunction between&#xD;
      normotensive and hypertensive PCC patients involved smaller proportion of study subjects. Sub&#xD;
      clinical changes in endomyocardium was presumed but not objectively assessed and hence its&#xD;
      reversal after surgical cure is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this research is to study the cardiac and vascular changes in Pheochromocytoma/&#xD;
      Paraganglioma patients and their reversal following curative surgery&#xD;

      The aim of this research is to study the cardiac and vascular changes in Pheochromocytoma/&#xD;
      Paraganglioma patients and their reversal following curative surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective, case-control study is conducted at SGPGIMS, Lucknow, India, tertiary care&#xD;
      referral institute, between January 2019 and September 2021 after approval from institutional&#xD;
      ethics committee. The study group includes 50 biochemically and histopathology proven PCC&#xD;
      /Paraganglioma patients, who after 1 to 3 weeks of α-adrenoceptor blockade with oral prazosin&#xD;
      undergo primary laparoscopic or open surgery. Cure of hypercatecholaminism will be documented&#xD;
      by normal 24-hour urinary fractionated metanephrine values at 7-10 days postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two contemporary age- and gender-matched control groups includes 10 newly detected (withtin 3&#xD;
      months) Essential Hypertensive (E-HT) patients, who will undergo treatment with standard&#xD;
      anti- HT medications and 10 Healthy individuals (normal in physical examination, ECG , Echo),&#xD;
      that include hospital staff nurses, technicians, doctors whom would be requested to&#xD;
      volunteer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the study group, besides the usual evaluation of PCC, also undergo detailed&#xD;
      cardiac and vascular evaluation, at diagnosis, at 7- 10 days of α-blockade, and 7 days, 3 and&#xD;
      6 months post adrenalectomy/ Paraganglioma excision and in control groups - E-HT controls,&#xD;
      cardiac evaluation is done at diagnosis and after 3 months of anti HT medications ; in&#xD;
      Healthy individuals, cardiac evaluation is done at the start of study and after 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CV evaluation includes 2D-echocardiography, speckle tracking Echo (for measuring global&#xD;
      longitudinal strain), serum NT-proBNP estimation and flow mediated vasodilatory studies by&#xD;
      Doppler Ultrasonography of the brachial artery to assess the endothelial dependent and smooth&#xD;
      muscle dependent vasodilatory responses&#xD;
