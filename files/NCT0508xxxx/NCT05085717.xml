      Insufficient screening and diagnostic delay play a significant role in sustaining the HIV&#xD;
      epidemic by France. No significant decline is recorded in heterosexual, whether born in&#xD;
      France or abroad. Gender inequalities major factors reinforce social inequalities in order to&#xD;
      of heterosexual men born abroad the most later diagnosed with HIV infection. Those gender&#xD;
      differences are largely due to efficiency antenatal HIV screening, offered to women every&#xD;
      pregnancy and widely accepted: a billed HIV serology in the context of pregnancy monitoring&#xD;
      was found for 92% pregnant women benefiting from health insurance in 2015. The arrival of a&#xD;
      child could be an opportunity to screening for the future father as well. However, well that&#xD;
      a consultation and a biological assessment intended for future fathers are provided for and&#xD;
      fully reimbursed by the social security, the health of men is not taken into account in&#xD;
      prenatal follow-up current French. The maternity hospital drains a population largely&#xD;
      immigrant, often precarious. She puts in contact with the care of pregnant women who were&#xD;
      sometimes distant, but not their companions: beyond the issue of reduction of the hidden HIV&#xD;
      epidemic, increased needs for prevention and access to health appeared to us for the pilot&#xD;
      phase of this project.&#xD;
