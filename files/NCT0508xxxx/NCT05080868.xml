  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Infantile hemangioma (IH) is the most common vascular tumor of infancy, characterized by its&#xD;
      clinical history. Absent at birth or present under the form of a premonitory mark, they&#xD;
      display a rapid proliferative phase starting in the first weeks of life. Then, after a&#xD;
      plateau phase, they slowly involute. However, a subtype of IH named &quot;abortive&quot;, &quot;minimal or&#xD;
      arrested growth&quot;, &quot;reticular&quot; or &quot;telangiectatic&quot; hemangioma differs from typical IH because&#xD;
      it doesn't have a proliferative component, or only a minimal one. This subtype of hemangioma&#xD;
      has been recently described and data are lacking regarding its proportion among infantile&#xD;
      hemangioma and its differences with &quot;classic&quot; infantile hemangioma. The aim of this study is&#xD;
      to estimate the proportion of abortive hemangioma among infantile hemangioma. Also, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to compare the clinical characteristics of &quot;classic&quot; infantile hemangiomas&#xD;
      and abortive hemangiomas. Lastly, investigators wished to study the evolution of abortive&#xD;
      hemangioma.&#xD;
