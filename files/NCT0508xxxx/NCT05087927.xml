  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Purpose: This study is partnering with communities to identify the best ways to provide HIV&#xD;
      prevention communication and services for women living in public housing who have been&#xD;
      disproportionately affected by HIV but underserved by current HIV prevention programs. The&#xD;
      investigators want to work with community members to develop and design the delivery of a&#xD;
      program to promote awareness of and access to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV&#xD;
      prevention among women living in public housing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Up to 248 cisgender females who are 18 years of age or older and currently&#xD;
      reside in Durham Housing Authority (DHA) housing will be enrolled in this study at UNC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures (methods): Data collection for this formative study will consist of 4 focus groups&#xD;
      of up to 12 women in each focus group living in DHA as well as a survey of 200 women living&#xD;
      in DHA.&#xD;

      Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This observational formative study consists of cross-sectional data collection with women&#xD;
      living in DHA (Durham Housing Authority) housing through surveys and focus group discussions.&#xD;
      Both modes of data collection will service to collect descriptive information to refine the&#xD;
      intervention. The survey will also include a randomized messaging experiment (see Data&#xD;
      Collection Procedures description below).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration, Enrollment and Number of Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      This formative study will last up to one year (12 months). The investigators will enroll up&#xD;
      to 248 participants (up to 200 survey participants and up to 48 focus group participants with&#xD;
      some women participating in both) as recruitment allows and as necessitated by thematic&#xD;
      saturation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The target population for this study is African American cisgender women at least 18 years&#xD;
      old residing in DHA community housing. The vast majority of DHA residents are African&#xD;
      American, so the investigators anticipate recruiting participants who are majority African&#xD;
      American without explicitly excluding prospective participants on the basis of race. Women&#xD;
      will be eligible to participate if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify as cisgender female (assigned female sex at birth and currently identify as&#xD;
           female)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Currently reside in Durham Housing Authority (DHA) housing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey&#xD;
&#xD;
      The self-administered electronic survey will assess the topics listed below and will include&#xD;
      a randomized messaging experiment to assess the effect of exposure messaging about PrEP with&#xD;
      variable framing on attitudes and perceived norms about PrEP. Participants will complete the&#xD;
      survey as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women recruited through community network referral may complete the survey on their own&#xD;
           device at the time of their choosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Women recruited through community/public events or FGDs will be provided the option to&#xD;
           either: a) complete the self-administered electronic survey during the event on a&#xD;
           study-owned device (if an in-person event). Limited literacy, vision-impaired, or any&#xD;
           participant who desires assistance may request that a study staff member read the&#xD;
           questions aloud to them for them to complete the survey, or request to complete the&#xD;
           survey as an interviewer-administered survey in a private location; or b) complete the&#xD;
           survey at a time of their choosing on their own device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Survey topics will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sociodemographic characteristics (age, race/ethnicity, DHA community of residence)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PrEP awareness &amp; knowledge&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attitudes toward PrEP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomized messaging experiment (see below)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceived PrEP norms&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceived ability to access PrEP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers and facilitators to using PrEP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceived HIV risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  HIV risk factors/behaviors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Likelihood to use PrEP/interest/willingness to use PrEP&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceived stigmas&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will include an embedded randomized 2 x 2 between-subjects experiment (gain vs.&#xD;
      loss framing by intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation messaging) evaluating the effects of the&#xD;
      alternative messaging approaches on intermediate endpoints in Table 3 of the protocol to&#xD;
      identify the approaches most associated with positive PrEP attitudes and norms. The&#xD;
      experiment will be embedded in a questionnaire administered before focus group sessions to 40&#xD;
      focus group participants and to 160 additional women in study communities (total of 200, 50&#xD;
      per community). During each of the 4 focus groups, the investigators also will explore&#xD;
      women's reactions to alternative modes (e.g., flyers, posters, apps, social media) of PrEP&#xD;
      messaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses for each messaging attribute are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Gain framing will be associated with more positive attitudes and more positive perceived&#xD;
      norms about PrEP than loss framing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gain framing: PrEP puts me in control&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss framing: Without PrEP, I'm less in control&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Demographic targeting will be associated with more positive attitudes and more positive&#xD;
      perceived norms about PrEP than non-demographically targeted messaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographically targeted: [Image of African American woman]&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extrinsic framing: [Image of women of multiple races]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Group Discussions (FGDs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Focus Group participants will be given the option to participate in a focus group by Zoom or&#xD;
      in person. Per North Carolina Executive Orders current at the time of data collection, the&#xD;
      investigators anticipate that in-person FGDs will be conducted in a private indoor location&#xD;
      with sufficient ventilation, 6-foot distancing between participants, and with face masks for&#xD;
      both FGD facilitators and participants. Focus groups with limited participants showing up may&#xD;
      be converted to individual in-depth interviews. With participant consent, FGDs will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded for analysis. Zoom focus groups will be video/audio-recorded with the video&#xD;
      deleted and the audio retained directly following the FGD. Focus groups will be led by&#xD;
      trained study staff members who will facilitate a discussion on the topics below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Current awareness &amp; knowledge of PrEP (including current sources of information about&#xD;
           PrEP)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Attitudes toward PrEP (including any stigmas about PrEP, perceived risk)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceptions of and recommendations for messaging about PrEP use among cisgender women&#xD;
           (open-ended then specific reactions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceptions of and recommendations for messaging about PrEP mobile unit (open-ended then&#xD;
           specific reactions)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preferences for mobile PrEP unit delivery features (e.g., timing, location, appointment&#xD;
           type, delivery of complementary services).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Best media/modes for providing messages about PrEP and the mobile unit to women in DHA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perceptions of peer networkers, best approach for contacting residents and providing&#xD;
           information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Barriers and facilitators to using PrEP&#xD;

    <description>A subset of the Attitudes toward PrEP Scale (APS) will be used to assess the association between message exposure and attitudes toward pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). This sub-set scale will include nine items rated on a 5-point Likert scale (responses ranging from 1=Strongly Disagree to 5=Strongly Agree). The nine items are a sub-set of the original APS scale and will include four items comprising sub-scale 2, three items comprising sub-scale 3, and two items from sub-scale 1. A mean score will be calculated for each complete sub-scale (2 and 3) ranging from 1-5. Each of the two items from sub-scale 1 will be scored individually, ranging from 1-5. Higher scores indicate more positive attitudes toward PrEP.</description>
