  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will investigate the safety and tolerability of increasing multiple intravenous&#xD;
      doses of BV100 by assessing the Incidence of treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs). In&#xD;
      addition the goal is to characterize the multiple dose pharmacokinetic profiles of rifabutin&#xD;
