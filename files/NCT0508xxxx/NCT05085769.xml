  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to examine the effects of obesity and bariatric surgery on gut microbiota in&#xD;
      a Turkish population, and to contribute to the literature by bringing multi-dimensional&#xD;
      parameters including dietary intake, metabolic and inflammatory markers. This case-control&#xD;
      study was conducted between June 2015 and August 2019. All participants were followed during&#xD;
      the six-month period. Face-to-face interviews and physical examinations were held, and blood&#xD;
      and fecal samples were collected at the baseline (M0) and at the end of 3 (M3) and 6 months&#xD;
      (M6). Dietary intakes of subjects were assessed using 24-h dietary recall method in each&#xD;
      interview and a detailed quantitative food frequency questionnaire that involved 85 food&#xD;
      items. Subjects were recruited to the study as three groups: 15 patients who had bariatric&#xD;
      surgery as study group, 8 morbidly obese participants who did not have bariatric surgery as&#xD;
      control group-1 and 11 participants who were non-obese (lean (n=5) and pre-obese (n=6)) as&#xD;
      control group-2. All subjects in the study group had sleeve gastrectomy. Subjects in control&#xD;
      groups were selected as age and gender matched with the participants in the study group.&#xD;
      Individuals were excluded if (a) they were under 19 or above 65 years old, (b) they had an&#xD;
      acute or chronic inflammatory disease, (c) they were diagnosed with infectious diseases,&#xD;
      cancer or alcohol addiction, (d) they used antibiotics in last 3 months before the screening.&#xD;
