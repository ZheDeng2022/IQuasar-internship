  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A low injection pressure is one of the safety elements to check the correct position of the&#xD;
      needle during regional anesthesia. Subjective assessment of pressure during manual injection&#xD;
      of local anesthetic is most commonly used. In adults, the monitoring of the injection&#xD;
      pressure has already been evaluated and makes it possible to objectify the pressure of the&#xD;
      injection pressure. This is possible thanks to a device named Compuflo. No study has measured&#xD;
      injection pressures during a regional anesthesia in children. The main objective is to&#xD;
      control the injection pressures exercised in daily clinical practice during pediatric&#xD;
      regional anesthesia with the Compuflo. Regional anesthesia will be proposed and explained&#xD;
      during the anesthesia consultation. The procedure will be performed according to the habits&#xD;
      of the anesthesiologist in charge of the patient. Only the addition of the Local Anesthetic&#xD;
      Injection Pressure monitoring (Compuflo) to the needle changes the usual setup.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the usual practice using Compuflo, allowing the&#xD;
      continuous measurement of the injection pressure of the local anesthetic at the needle level.&#xD;
      On the day of the surgery, an anesthesiologist &quot;operator&quot; will realize the echo-guided&#xD;
      regional anesthesia, qualifying aloud every injection realized (site or compartment of&#xD;
      injection, and volume injected). An &quot;observer&quot; anesthesiologist will note the demographic&#xD;
      data (age and weight), then the material data (minimum stimulation intensity, type and size&#xD;
      of needles and syringes used), and finally he will note the maximum pressure levels reached&#xD;
      during the injections performed.&#xD;
