  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study involves an investigational product: Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with veledimex&#xD;
      for production of human IL-12. IL-12 is a protein that can improve the body's natural&#xD;
      response to disease by enhancing the ability of the immune system to kill tumor cells and may&#xD;
      interfere with blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and tolerability of a single&#xD;
      intratumoral injection of Ad-RTS-hIL-12 given with oral veledimex.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are scheduled for craniotomy and tumor resection will receive one dose of&#xD;
      veledimex before the resection procedure. Ad-RTS-hIL-12 will be administered by free-hand&#xD;
      injection. Patients will continue on oral veledimex for 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided into three periods: the screening period, the treatment period and the&#xD;
      follow-up period.&#xD;

             to, colitis, pneumonitis, unstable angina, congestive heart failure, myocardial&#xD;
