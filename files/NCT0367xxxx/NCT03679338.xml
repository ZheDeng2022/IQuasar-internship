  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      90 % of the patients with bile duct cancer are not justifiable of a surgical resection with&#xD;
      curative aim for oncologic reasons ( metastatic extensions), for reasons of resectability&#xD;
      (canalar extension, vascular) or still for surgically reasons (age, comorbidity).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The palliative care of these patients consists at first in assuring an effective biliary&#xD;
      drainage, infectious complications being one of the main causes of death. The biliary&#xD;
      drainage allows to improve the survival of these patients. It bases by the implementation, by&#xD;
      the endoscopic or percutaneous way of biliary, generally metallic prosthesis the duration of&#xD;
      average permeability of which is of approximately 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard oncologic treatment is the administration of a chemotherapy exclusive or&#xD;
      associated with a radiotherapy. The radiotherapy and the radio chemotherapy did not show&#xD;
      efficiency on the survival superior to the exclusive biliary drainage. The first-line&#xD;
      exclusive chemotherapy bases on the gemcitabine-cisplatin association with a median survival&#xD;
      of 11,6 months. No study allows to justify the administration of a chemotherapy of the second&#xD;
      line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus the preservation of the permeability of the biliary ways is today, the most important&#xD;
      factor to improve the survival of these patients. Therefore, the addition of a treatment&#xD;
      allowing to obtain a local tumoral response to the insertion of biliary prosthesis would&#xD;
      allow to increase the duration of permeability of the biliary prosthesis and would limit the&#xD;
      local evolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endoductal destruction tumoral technics were thus developed in this indication:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dynamic phototherapy which demonstrated, during preliminary studies, a certain&#xD;
           efficiency both on the tumoral response estimated on the improvement of the tumoral&#xD;
           stenosis as on the survival in case of cholangiocarcinoma bile ducts not resectables.&#xD;
           However, the improvement of the survival was not confirmed by wider randomized studies.&#xD;
           A study randomized of phase III was interrupted prematurely because of a survival&#xD;
           decreased in the experimental arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The radium therapy and the brachytherapy were estimated in this indication with results&#xD;
           interesting on series limited in size, but is not used in routine because of its cost&#xD;
           and of technics difficulties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ablation therapy technics (radio frequency, microwaves, radium therapy) percutaneous by&#xD;
      radiological or surgical way proved their efficiency for the treatment of hepatocarcinoma and&#xD;
      liver metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hepatic radio frequency was estimated, during trials of phases II, for peripheral&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma intra hepatic (developed at a distance main bile ducts) with interesting&#xD;
      tumoral rates of necrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the direct percutaneous access of the cholangiocarcinoma of the biliary ways is not&#xD;
      practicable because of the risk of iatrogenic biliary fistula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, systems allowing to realize ablation therapy by endoductal radio frequency are&#xD;
      from now on available. It is miniaturized bipolar probes which are inserted into bile ducts&#xD;
      by reactionary way (retrograde cholangiography), or anterograde percutaneous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two systems (Habib ®, ELLRA ®) are at present available and were estimated during in vitro&#xD;
      and in vivo studies, to the animal and in man.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purposes of this study are to estimate the feasibility, the efficiency and the morbidity&#xD;
      of the biliary radio frequency for the treatment of the extra hepatic cholangiocarcinoma non&#xD;
      resectable (resection or transplantation).&#xD;
