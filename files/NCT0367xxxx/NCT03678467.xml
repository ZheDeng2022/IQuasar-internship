  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EpiBone-Craniomaxillofacial (EB-CMF) is an autologous, anatomically shaped bone graft created&#xD;
      specifically for the patient's defect, using the patients own adipose-derived mesenchymal&#xD;
      stem cells. This first in human trial is designed specifically to assess the safety of EB-CMF&#xD;
      clinically. Although secondary measures of graft efficacy are being assessed, the primary&#xD;
      focus will be on Adverse Events stemming from graft implantation.&#xD;
