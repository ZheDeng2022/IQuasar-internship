  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      While there are effective treatments for depression available, some patients do not see&#xD;
      results with these options. Often, these patients are referred to electroconvulsive therapy&#xD;
      (ECT) which has drawbacks such as adverse side effects, cost, and limited access. Recent&#xD;
      research shows that intravenous ketamine may be an alternative option for these patients due&#xD;
      to its rapid antidepressant effect sustained with multiple treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit 240 participants from the ECT waiting list at the five participating&#xD;
      hospitals, and randomize them to either the ketamine or ECT treatment arm. Participants in&#xD;
      the ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5mg/kg ketamine intravenously (IV) over 40 minutes&#xD;
      as described in the study schedule. Participants in the ECT treatment arm will receive ECT as&#xD;
      described in the study schedule and as decided by their treating physician. Throughout the&#xD;
      study, clinical, neuroimaging, molecular, and cognitive assessments will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to show that compared to ECT, ketamine treatment produces faster&#xD;
      results, has less side effects, requires less or shorter hospitalizations, and is less&#xD;
      expensive. The measures collected throughout the study (clinician scales, self-reports, blood&#xD;
      samples, and neuroimaging) may help with predicting if future patients will respond to ECT or&#xD;
      ketamine. This could lead to faster, more effective treatment for patient with depression.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Worldwide, depression carries a significant burden. Although there are effective treatments&#xD;
      for depression, many patients do not achieve remission, and any significant response usually&#xD;
      occurs after a few weeks. The common approach for a rapid intervention in cases of severe&#xD;
      depressive symptoms has been electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). There are drawbacks to ECT&#xD;
      including a prior medical work-up, general anaesthesia, and the possibility of memory loss.&#xD;
      Further, access to ECT is often limited. Comparatively, the most striking breakthrough in the&#xD;
      field of mood disorders has been the rapid antidepressant effects of intravenous ketamine.&#xD;
      The antidepressant response to ketamine often occurs within a few hours, and peaks within 24.&#xD;
      Recent studies have documented that the benefits of ketamine can be sustained with repeated&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This longitudinal, multi-centre, randomized, crossover clinical trial is funded in part by&#xD;
      the Ontario Brain Institute through a sponsorship with the Canadian Biomarker Integration&#xD;
      Network in Depression (CAN-BIND) research program. It will take place across five sites: the&#xD;
      Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (lead site), Douglas Mental Health University Institute,&#xD;
      Providence Care Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University Health Network.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 240 participants (accounting for 20% dropout) will be recruited over 30 months&#xD;
      from ECT wait lists across the five sites and randomized to either the ketamine or ECT&#xD;
      treatment arm. Participants in the ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40&#xD;
      minutes in the recovery room of the ECT clinic as per the study schedule. Participants in the&#xD;
      ECT treatment arm will receive ECT as per the study schedule and as decided by their treating&#xD;
      physician. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for between six weeks and nine&#xD;
      months, or until they leave the study or the study is terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, clinical, neuroimaging, molecular, and cognitive assessments will be&#xD;
      conducted. Data will be collected using the Ontario Brain Institute's Centre for Ontario Data&#xD;
      Exploration and Research Electronic Data Capture in order to coordinate data from the five&#xD;
      sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomized to the either treatment arm will receive thrice weekly treatments for&#xD;
      3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the randomization&#xD;
      phase, responders may move to the maintenance phase and non-responders may move to the&#xD;
      crossover phase where they will receive the alternate therapy. During the crossover phase,&#xD;
      participants will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12&#xD;
      treatments respectively. Following the crossover phase, responders will move to the&#xD;
      maintenance phase and non-responders will exit the study. During the maintenance phase,&#xD;
      participants who achieved response with ketamine will receive weekly ketamine treatments for&#xD;
      one month, treatment once every two weeks for two months, and monthly treatment for three&#xD;
      months. Should participants in the ketamine arm relapse during monthly treatment, they may&#xD;
      return to treatments once every two weeks. Participants who achieved response in the ECT arm&#xD;
      will receive ECT treatment for six months based on decision of the treating physician in&#xD;
      order to maintain a clinical response. Both treatment arms will have a follow-up visit during&#xD;
      month seven.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to show that compared to ECT, ketamine treatment produces faster&#xD;
      therapeutic action, has less side effects, requires fewer/shorter hospitalizations for&#xD;
      patients, and will be less expensive because it does not require an anaesthesiologist and a&#xD;
      psychiatrist to administer the various ECT protocols. Through the discovery of biomarkers to&#xD;
      predict ECT or ketamine response or non-response, the anticipated effective treatment could&#xD;
      be administered as a first line intervention for a subgroup of depressed patients, thereby&#xD;
      ensuring a more time-efficient intervention.&#xD;
