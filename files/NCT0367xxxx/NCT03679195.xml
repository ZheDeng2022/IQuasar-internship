  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The general objective of this project is to investigate the chronic effect of consuming&#xD;
      supplements combining polyphenols from cranberry and grape seed extracts and L-citrulline&#xD;
      (Nitric Oxide Ultra capsules, Pure Encapsulations, Sudbury, MA) on 24-hour ambulatory blood&#xD;
      pressure, markers of vascular function and plasma biomarkers of inflammation in adults with&#xD;
      pre-hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be undertaken according to a double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled design and will be conducted at the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods&#xD;
      (INAF) of Laval University. The study will involve a total of 73 adult men and women.&#xD;
      Included subjects will be randomly assigned to a 6-week period of supplementation with Nitric&#xD;
      Oxide (NO) Ultra capsules or placebo (cellulose capsules). The outcomes are the chronic&#xD;
      changes after supplementation with NO Ultra capsules compared with the placebo in: 24-hour&#xD;
      ambulatory diastolic and systolic blood pressure, levels of blood lipids and inflammation&#xD;
      markers, levels of blood and cutaneous markers of vascular function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is now evidence that blood pressure, vascular function and inflammation are intimately&#xD;
      associated with cardiovascular disease. It is also clear that several dietary components&#xD;
      including polyphenols and L-citrulline can modify blood pressure control. However, based on&#xD;
      the studies available so far, it is difficult to draw firm conclusion on the potential impact&#xD;
      of a dietary supplement combining polyphenols and L-citrulline on ambulatory blood pressure&#xD;
      in pre-hypertensive subjects at risk to develop hypertension and cardiovascular disease. To&#xD;
      the best of our knowledge, no study has yet investigated the chronic impact of combined&#xD;
      polyphenols and L-citrulline on both ambulatory blood pressure and vascular&#xD;
      function/inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present supplementation based on polyphenols and L-citrulline may represent for&#xD;
      pre-hypertensive subjects a new dietary modality to manage blood pressure as part of healthy&#xD;
      eating.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be undertaken according to a double-blind, parallel, randomized, placebo&#xD;
      controlled design and will be conducted at the Institute of Nutrition and Functional Foods&#xD;
      (INAF) of Laval University. A total of 73 adult men and women will be recruited based&#xD;
      primarily on blood pressure criteria in the Quebec City metropolitan area. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to a 6-week period of supplementation with Nitric Oxide Ultra capsules&#xD;
      or placebo (cellulose capsules). Participants in the NO Ultra group will be supplemented with&#xD;
      764 mg/day of cranberry and grape seed extracts (containing polyphenols) and 2 g/day of&#xD;
      L-citrulline. Participants will have to take daily 2 capsules (NO Ultra or placebo) between&#xD;
      breakfast and lunch and 2 capsules (NO Ultra or placebo) between lunch and dinner.&#xD;
      Specifically, capsules will be taken with water and no foods, and at least one-hour apart&#xD;
      meals. Office and 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure, blood lipids, cutaneous and plasma&#xD;
      markers of vascular function, plasma inflammation biomarkers and anthropometric&#xD;
      characteristics will be measured at the beginning and at the end of the study.&#xD;
