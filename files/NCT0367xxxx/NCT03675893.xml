  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a combination of targeted therapies as a possible treatment&#xD;
      for estrogen-receptor positive (ER+) endometrial cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The drugs involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Abemaciclib (also known as Verzenio™)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Letrozole (also known as Femara®)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials evaluate whether investigational&#xD;
      drugs are effective against a specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drugs are&#xD;
      being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved abemaciclib or letrozole for ER+ endometrial cancer, but both drugs&#xD;
      have been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Abemaciclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitor. CDK inhibitors work to stop cancer&#xD;
      cell growth. Letrozole is a hormonal therapy that works by lowering the production of&#xD;
      estrogen in the body. Estrogen may help to stimulate cancer cells to grow, so lowering the&#xD;
      levels of estrogen in the body may work to slow cancer cell growth. In this research study,&#xD;
      the investigators are hoping to learn whether the combination of abemaciclib and letrozole is&#xD;
      effective at slowing or stopping endometrial cancer cell growth.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have cytologically or histologically confirmed endometrial cancer&#xD;
             that is recurrent or metastatic and/or resistant to standard therapies, or for which&#xD;
             no standard therapy is available.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have ER-positive disease, defined as ≥ 1 percent of tumor cell&#xD;
             nuclei being immunoreactive by immunohistochemistry (IHC). If multiple analyses have&#xD;
             been performed, judgment should be based on the most recent biopsy or pathology&#xD;
             specimen analyzed in a CLIA-certified laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have measurable disease, defined as at least one lesion that can be&#xD;
             accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest diameter to be recorded for&#xD;
             non-nodal lesions and short axis for nodal lesions) as ≥20 mm with conventional&#xD;
             techniques or as ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan, MRI, or calipers by clinical exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age ≥ 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status of 0 or 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have normal organ and bone marrow function as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absolute neutrophil count ≥ 1,500/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Platelets ≥ 100,000/mcL&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 × institutional upper limit of normal (ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  AST(SGOT)/ALT(SGPT) ≤ 2.5 × institutional ULN, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  5 × institutional ULN if liver metastases are present&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine ≤ 1.5 × institutional ULN, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Creatinine clearance ≥ 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 for participants with creatinine levels&#xD;
                  above institutional normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of the study agents on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this&#xD;
             reason, women of child-bearing potential must agree to use a medically approved&#xD;
             contraceptive method during the treatment period and for 3 months following the last&#xD;
             dose of study agent. Contraceptive methods may include an intrauterine device (IUD) or&#xD;
             barrier method. If condoms are used as a barrier method, a spermicidal agent should be&#xD;
             added as a double barrier protection. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is&#xD;
             pregnant while she is participating in this study, she should inform her treating&#xD;
             physician immediately. A negative serum pregnancy test is required for study entry&#xD;
             from women of childbearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow and retain oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have archival tissue available for analysis in the form of a&#xD;
             formalin-fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) block or unstained slides. Note: confirmation&#xD;
             of availability of archival tissue is the only requirement for eligibility, archival&#xD;
             tissue does not need to be received by the study team prior to enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had chemotherapy, immune therapy, other investigational therapy,&#xD;
             or major surgery within 4 weeks (6 weeks for nitrosoureas or mitomycin C) prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of study medication. Previous hormonal therapy, including prior letrozole,&#xD;
             is allowed and there is no required washout period for hormonal therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy within 5 half-lives&#xD;
             of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have had radiation therapy within 2 weeks of the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have received previous treatment with CDK4/6 inhibitors, including&#xD;
             but not limited to previous abemaciclib therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with known brain metastases should be excluded from this clinical trial&#xD;
             because of their poor prognosis and because they often develop progressive neurologic&#xD;
             dysfunction that would confound the evaluation of neurologic and other adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic&#xD;
             composition to the study agents that the participant will be administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who at the time of study enrollment are known to require concomitant&#xD;
             therapy with moderate or strong CYP3A4 inducers, or strong inhibitors of CYP3A4. Due&#xD;
             to potential drug interactions, concomitant use of these medications is not permitted&#xD;
             for the duration of treatment on trial. Participants are eligible for study entry if&#xD;
             an appropriate substitution is made prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac&#xD;
             arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with histories or evidence of cardiovascular risk including any of the&#xD;
             following: acute coronary syndromes (i.e. myocardial infarction or angina), coronary&#xD;
             angioplasty, or stenting within 6 months prior to study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the study agents are anti-cancer&#xD;
             agents with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is&#xD;
             an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to&#xD;
             treatment of the mother with the study agents, breastfeeding must be discontinued if&#xD;
             the mother is treated on trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Individuals with a history of a different malignancy are ineligible with the following&#xD;
             exceptions: individuals who have been treated and are disease-free for a minimum of 5&#xD;
             years prior to study enrollment, or individuals who are deemed by the treating&#xD;
             investigator to be at low risk for disease recurrence. Additionally, individuals with&#xD;
             the following cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated within the past 5 years:&#xD;
             basal or squamous cell carcinomas of the skin, and breast or cervical carcinomas in&#xD;
             situ.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known HIV-positive participants are ineligible because of the increased risk of lethal&#xD;
             infections when treated with marrow-suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of uncontrolled hypertension despite optimal medical&#xD;
             management, defined as systolic blood pressure &gt; 150 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure&#xD;
             &gt; 90 mmHg&#xD;
