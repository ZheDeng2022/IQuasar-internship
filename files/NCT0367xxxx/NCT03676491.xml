  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia is a common sleep disorder for patients with depression. This has a major impact on&#xD;
      the quality of life for the individual.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to investigate, whether music intervention is effective in&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. improving sleep quality,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. reducing symptoms of depression and&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. improving quality of life&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants use a sound pillow and selected music in the The Music Star app at home as a&#xD;
      sleep aid in 4 weeks.&#xD;

      Depression is a common health problem in Denmark with a prevalence for depression of 17-18%.&#xD;
      Depression has serious personal and social consequence. Sleep disorders are common in&#xD;
      patients with depression. Resolving sleep disturbances in depression may prevent worsening of&#xD;
      symptoms and relapse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Music listening is widely used as a sleep aid. A study from the Cochrane library shows&#xD;
      consensus that music may be helpful to improve sleep quality in insomnia. It remains unclear&#xD;
      if music listening is helpful to patients with depression as it is to a broader population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial address the use of music as a supplementary treatment to&#xD;
      improve sleep in depression.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study design is an explanatory mixed methods design in two parts. The first part is a two-arm parallel group, single center randomized controlled trial (n=120). Experimental group and waitlist control group receive standard treatment according to national guidelines. The experimental group use a sound pillow and The Music Star App at bedtime as a sleep aid in 4 weeks.The second part is an interview study (n=4). Qualitative data from a semi-structured interview on the use of music and sleep are used to discuss findings from the RCT.</intervention_model_description>
