      The LifeFlow rapid infusion device is a handheld manually-operated device that has been shown&#xD;
      in early trials to increase the rate of bolus fluid infusion up to 3 times the rate of&#xD;
      delivery attributed to conventional rapid infusion devices. The device addresses other&#xD;
      technical barriers to fluid resuscitation, including reducing complexity and provider&#xD;
      fatigue. LifeFlow utilizes standard IV or intraosseous (IO) vascular access devices to&#xD;
      quickly and efficiently deliver appropriate volumes of crystalloid fluid to patients during&#xD;
      emergent fluid resuscitation. The purpose of this study is to determine if intravenous fluids&#xD;
      can be administered more rapidly and efficiently with the use of the LifeFlow rapid infusion&#xD;
      device compared to the current standard techniques in adult patients who present to the&#xD;
      Emergency Department with septic shock.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with conditions such as septic shock, anaphylaxis, and hypovolemic shock may require&#xD;
      rapid fluid administration to restore blood pressure and tissue perfusion. Newly Updated&#xD;
      Surviving Sepsis Campaign (SSC) guidelines call for patients with septic shock to receive a&#xD;
      30ml/kg intravenous (IV) fluid challenge within 1 hour of emergency department (ED) arrival,&#xD;
      with improved outcomes shown with early fluid infusion. Patients with shock and severe&#xD;
      hypotension may require even more rapid fluid treatment, up to 4ml/kg/min. While excess fluid&#xD;
      infusion may be associated with harm, early fluid infusion for the reversal of shock can&#xD;
      reduce the need for subsequent interventions, ultimately leading to improved patient&#xD;
      outcomes. This may be especially true in patients with hypotension, who are at greater risk&#xD;
      of death if not treated quickly, as a single episode of hypotension in patients with sepsis&#xD;
      is correlated with a significantly increased risk of death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients who require IV fluid bolus therapy, technical barriers such as slow infusion&#xD;
      rates, technically complex infusion devices, and inadequate nursing resources may lead to&#xD;
      delay in fluid administration and inadequate resuscitation. As recommended by the SSC&#xD;
      guidelines, patients receiving fluid bolus therapy for septic shock require frequent&#xD;
      reassessment of clinical response. With current fluid delivery techniques, the ability to&#xD;
      reassess quickly and relate fluid administration directly to markers of hemodynamic&#xD;
      improvement is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LifeFlow rapid infusion device is a handheld manually-operated device that has been shown&#xD;
      in early trials to increase the rate of bolus fluid infusion up to 3 times the rate of&#xD;
      delivery attributed to conventional rapid infusion devices. The device addresses other&#xD;
      technical barriers to fluid resuscitation, including reducing complexity and provider&#xD;
      fatigue. LifeFlow utilizes standard IV or intraosseous (IO) vascular access devices to&#xD;
      quickly and efficiently deliver appropriate volumes of crystalloid fluid to patients during&#xD;
      emergent fluid resuscitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine if intravenous fluids can be administered more&#xD;
      rapidly and efficiently with the use of the LifeFlow rapid infusion device compared to the&#xD;
      current standard techniques in adult patients who present to the Emergency Department with&#xD;
      septic shock.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intravenous fluids can be administered more rapidly and efficiently with the use of the&#xD;
           LifeFlow rapid infusion device compared to the current techniques in patients who&#xD;
           present to the ED with hypotension and suspected septic shock Secondary Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypotensive patients receiving intravenous fluids utilizing the LifeFlow infusion device&#xD;
           will have more rapid normalization of vital sign parameters (i.e., resolution of&#xD;
           hypotension = MAP 65 mmHg or greater), and more rapid improvement in markers of tissue&#xD;
           ischemia (i.e., lactate clearance) than patients receiving fluid using other techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Based on reduced ICU and hospital length of stay (LOS), the overall cost of treatment&#xD;
           will be lower in ED patients receiving early IV fluid resuscitation with LifeFlow&#xD;
           comparted to similar patients treated with standard techniques.&#xD;

    <description>After obtaining the consent, the subject will have a bedside ultrasound performed by the study investigator after receiving 500 ml of intravenous fluid bolus. The images will be recorded on ultrasound machine hard drive for future review. If the bedside ultrasound findings determine that the subject is not fluid responsive, subjects will be excluded from the study. If the subject is determined to be fluid responsive, the above listed outcome measures will be collected. Ultrasound will be repeated after every 500 ml bolus if the patient continues to receive IV fluids which will be determined by the treating physician. Ultrasound measurements and other parameters listed above will be collected throughout the ED and hospital stay.</description>
