  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lower limb prosthesis users are known to be at a substantially increased fall risk compared&#xD;
      to able-bodied individuals. The interaction between increased fall risk, reduced balance&#xD;
      confidence and high prevalence of a fear of falling often leads to restricted mobility and&#xD;
      loss of independence. Critically, the cause of these falls and the role that inherent balance&#xD;
      plays in fall risk is poorly understood. This study proposes to identify key differences in&#xD;
      balance and mobility between older below-knee prosthesis users who have fallen twice or more&#xD;
      in the past 12 months and those who have fallen once or less, and compare both groups to data&#xD;
      from able-bodied individuals. By further understanding the differences between these groups&#xD;
      and relationships between fall risk and various outcome measures, intervention techniques can&#xD;
      be developed to improve functional balance. An improvement in upright balance will reduce the&#xD;
      occurrence of falls and fall related injuries in this veteran population, as well as increase&#xD;
      their participation in daily activities and improve their quality of life.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Previous studies have shown that persons with transtibial amputations (TTA) are at a&#xD;
      substantially increased risk of falling as compared to able-bodied age-matched controls and&#xD;
      have reduced confidence in their balance, both contributing to their restricted mobility and&#xD;
      daily activity. This risk increases with progressing age, as aging affects musculoskeletal&#xD;
      and somatosensory systems that are vital to controlling upright balance (i.e., maintaining&#xD;
      the body center-of-mass (BCoM) within the limits of the base-of-support) and are already&#xD;
      compromised in persons with TTA. An important consequence of elevated fall incidence is an&#xD;
      increased risk of fall-related injuries that may lead to lost participation and independence.&#xD;
      The effects of reduced sensory-motor function on upright balance in older adults has been&#xD;
      extensively studied and led to development of effective assessment tools and intervention&#xD;
      strategies to minimize fall risk. However, the dearth of similar studies and relatively poor&#xD;
      understanding of the effects of additional complications from TTA on upright balance have&#xD;
      significantly hampered progress towards addressing this important concern for Veterans with&#xD;
      TTA. Consequently, this limits knowledge of predictive factors of falls among these&#xD;
      prosthesis users and for informing therapeutic interventions that enhance functional balance.&#xD;
      Therefore, the primary objective of this research is to develop an improved understanding of&#xD;
      the sensory-motor mechanisms underlying upright balance and fall risk in older Veterans with&#xD;
      TTA. The proposed study will compare differences between three age- and gender-matched&#xD;
      groups: 1) amputees who reported two or more falls in the past 12 months, 2) amputee controls&#xD;
      (one fall or less in the past 12 months), and 3) able-bodied controls.&#xD;
