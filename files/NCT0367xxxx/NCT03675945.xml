  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is common following surgery in children. Currently, no recent review of pain profiles at&#xD;
      home has been performed on pediatric population in France following general surgery in&#xD;
      children. The aim of this study is to evaluate the duration and severity of pain felt by&#xD;
      children using a mobile phone application. All children operated in the different centers and&#xD;
      leaving home will be included in the study. Children's pain scores will be measured using&#xD;
      PPMP-SF scale (Postoperative Pain Measure for Parents Short Form). Data on prescribed and&#xD;
      administered analgesia, nausea-vomiting, behavioral problems and parental satisfaction will&#xD;
      be collected. The expected results are an inventory's objective observation of postoperative&#xD;
      pain profiles at home following the different pediatric surgeries in France. The study will&#xD;
      also highlight the different risk factors of postoperative pain (type of surgery, parental&#xD;
      causes, reasons due to the child, medical causes).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Data from literature suggest that control of postoperative pain remains difficult and&#xD;
      insufficient despite interventions to improve the management of children's home-based&#xD;
      postoperative pain. In 2017, a recent Australian prospective audit confirms that pain is&#xD;
      still underestimated and under-treated by medical staff and home-based families. Currently,&#xD;
      no recent review of pain profiles at home has been performed on the pediatric population in&#xD;
      France following general surgery in children. The aim of this study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      duration and severity of pain felt by children using a mobile phone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is an epidemiological, observational, prospective and multicenter trial. All&#xD;
      children operated in the different centers and leaving home will be included in the study.&#xD;
      The peri-operative analgesic treatment will be left to the discretion of the various centers.&#xD;
      In addition to the surgical follow-up, post-operative follow-up at home will be carried out&#xD;
      using the smartphone application for all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of the application will have been explained during the intervention's programming.&#xD;
      The application will be downloaded by the parents at home. Parents will be alerted by&#xD;
      notifications when they have tracking data to enter. The primary endpoint will be the&#xD;
      evaluation of postoperative pain thanks to PPMP-SF scale. Data on prescribed and administered&#xD;
      analgesia, nausea-vomiting, behavioral problems and parental satisfaction will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis will first include a descriptive study of the population. Qualitative&#xD;
      data will be expressed as means and standard deviations, and quantitative data as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages. Before carrying out each comparative analysis, the application's conditions of&#xD;
      the tests used will be verified. The different tests will be considered significant at the 5%&#xD;
      threshold unless otherwise specified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected results are an inventory's objective observation of postoperative pain profiles&#xD;
      at home following the different pediatric surgeries in France. The study will also highlight&#xD;
      the different risk factors of postoperative pain (type of surgery, parental causes, reasons&#xD;
      due to the child, medical causes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A recent study in Sweden in adult population has shown that systematic e-assessment can&#xD;
      improve patients' quality of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A mobile phone application on postoperative pain assessment in pediatric population would&#xD;
      improve the management of children's pain and therefore improve the quality of postoperative&#xD;
      recovery at home.&#xD;
