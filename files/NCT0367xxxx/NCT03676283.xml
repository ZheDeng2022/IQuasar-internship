  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Partners of patients with advanced cancer often take a great responsibility for the patient's&#xD;
      care. They are often unprepared for a situation where they are faced both with the role as&#xD;
      caregivers and with the patient's impending death. This project holds significant research&#xD;
      questions on how to implement a web-based intervention and make it easily available to all&#xD;
      those in need and prevent negative consequences related to caregiving and the loss of a&#xD;
      partner. The project will study the effects of using a website for support and information.&#xD;
      Instruments for measuring outcomes will be available both on paper or electronically. To&#xD;
      obtain data for the main outcomes, preparedness for caregiving and for death, 200 partners&#xD;
      will be recruited and receive access to the website. Preparedness for caregiving will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and four weeks later (pre- and post-intervention. Further,&#xD;
      sem-structured interviews will be performed. Preparedness for death will be measured eight&#xD;
      weeks after the patient's death. Because current trends point towards increased levels of&#xD;
      home-care, web-based interventions could be a way to reach more partners in a more&#xD;
      cost-effective way.&#xD;

      Partners of patients with advanced cancer often take a great responsibility for the patient's&#xD;
      care. They are often unprepared for a situation where they are faced both with the role as&#xD;
      caregivers and with the patient's impending death. This lack of preparedness has been&#xD;
      associated with psychological and physical unhealth. Interventions delivered by&#xD;
      multi-professional palliative care teams have proved to be effective both in promoting&#xD;
      preparedness for caregiving, death and the continued life of the bereaved. This project holds&#xD;
      significant research questions on how to implement an intervention and make it easily&#xD;
      available to all those in need and prevent negative consequences related to caregiving and&#xD;
      the loss of a partner. To reach as many partners as possible, a web-based intervention has&#xD;
      been developed on a website (närstående.se) which consists of supportive films and text as&#xD;
      well as an online forum. The films show conversations between partners (actors) and&#xD;
      healthcare professionals (authentic). The conversations concern potentially modifiable&#xD;
      topics, such as medical issues and communication, that are associated with preparedness. The&#xD;
      project will study the effects of proactive telephone calls that will be delivered to&#xD;
      partners with the aim to support their use of the website. Instruments for measuring outcomes&#xD;
      will be available both on paper or electronically. To obtain data for the main outcomes,&#xD;
      preparedness for caregiving and for death, 200 partners will be recruited and get access to&#xD;
      the website. They will also receive a telephone call with instructions on how to use the&#xD;
      website and have access to technical support if necessary. Preparedness for caregiving will&#xD;
      be measured at baseline and four weeks later (pre- and post-intervention). Preparedness for&#xD;
      death will be measured eight weeks after the patient's death. The status of the modifiable&#xD;
      topics will be measured at baseline and four weeks later. Physical and psychological health&#xD;
      of the partner will be measured one year later. Further, semi-structured interviews will be&#xD;
      performed with participants to explore the feasibility and acceptibility of the web&#xD;
      intervention. The project will add significant knowledge about whether web-based support has&#xD;
      the potential to increase preparedness and decrease negative consequences for partners of&#xD;
      patients with advanced cancer during ongoing care and after the patient's death. Because&#xD;
      current trends point towards increased levels of home-care, web-based interventions could be&#xD;
      a way to reach more partners in a more cost-effective way. This project is meant to be a&#xD;
      pilot to a larger study with a randomised controlled design.&#xD;
