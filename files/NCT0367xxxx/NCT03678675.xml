  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates how a protocol of scheduled non-narcotic anesthetic used in the&#xD;
      immediate post-operative period affects the average patient pain scale scores and the amount&#xD;
      of oral narcotic medication administered. The objective of the study is to identify a&#xD;
      post-operative pain control regimen that can decrease the amount of oral narcotic medications&#xD;
      administered in the post-operative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the amount of morphine milligram equivalents (MME) used in each&#xD;
      group. Secondary outcomes will include pain scores, postoperative complete blood count, and&#xD;
      post-operative satisfaction with care received during admission.&#xD;

      Subjects who consented to be part of the trial will be randomized at the time of skin closure&#xD;
      of their cesarean section to either the standard group or the study group. The standard group&#xD;
      will receive the standard treatment of 2 doses of 30mg IV Ketorolac on an as needed basis.&#xD;
      The study group will receive 6 doses of 30mg IV Ketorolac scheduled every 6 hours. The&#xD;
      subject will receive her first dose in the operating room. The ob/gyn residents will be&#xD;
      responsible for placing the orders in Sorian for either &quot;Standard Post-Operative Pain&#xD;
      Control&quot; order set or the &quot;Ketorolac Study Post Cesarean Section Pain Control&quot; order set.&#xD;
      Please see below for sample order sets. Pain scores will be evaluated using a visual analog&#xD;
      pain scale every 6 hours throughout hospitalization and recorded in the electronic medical&#xD;
      record. The amount of oral opiate medications administered for subjects in each group will be&#xD;
      recorded in the electronic medical record as well.&#xD;

    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The amount of MME's will be monitored for each group. MME's will be determined by the amount of opiate mediations administered. The MME value can range from 0 to typically 200 MME's, however there is no upper limit of measureable MME's. The MME's for each patient will be a sum of MME's administered throughout the course of the hospitalization.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pain scores</measure>
    <time_frame>2 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The patient reported pain scores will be recorded and analyzed for each group. The Pain Score is determined by the patient using a visual analog scale with a range from 0-10, where 0 is no pain at all and 10 is the worst pain imaginable for the patient.</description>
