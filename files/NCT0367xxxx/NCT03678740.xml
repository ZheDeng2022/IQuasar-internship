  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A previous NAMDC survey study (NAMDC 7414 - Diagnostic Odyssey Survey, referred to hereafter&#xD;
      as Odyssey1), provided a benchmark account of the substantial challenges faced by patients in&#xD;
      achieving a diagnosis of mitochondrial disease, and of the impact such a diagnosis has on&#xD;
      them (Grier et al. 2018).1 This study was conducted from October 2015 through January 2016.&#xD;
      We propose a new survey study (Odyssey2) which will provide an update, additional data&#xD;
      collection (duration of the diagnostic odyssey), and allow assessment of next-generation DNA&#xD;
      sequencing techniques since Odyssey1 concluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Odyssey2 will retain the strengths (simplicity, brevity, confidentiality, and data quality&#xD;
      assurance measures) which made Odyssey1 successful. While Odyssey2 adds some refinements&#xD;
      based on experience learned from Odyssey1, the basic questions are changed as little as&#xD;
      possible to maximize comparability, and the additions are limited. Odyssey1 consisted of&#xD;
      between 16 and 23 questions, depending on skip patterns, and took an estimated 15 minutes to&#xD;
      complete. Odyssey2 consists of between 23 and 33 questions, depending on skip patterns and we&#xD;
      estimate that it will take approximately 20 minutes to complete. As in Odyssey1, only&#xD;
      patients who report, directly or through a guardian, that they have been informed by a doctor&#xD;
      that they have a confirmed mitochondrial disorder will be eligible for Odyssey2.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      To gain an understanding of the &quot;Diagnostic Odyssey&quot; patients with mitochondrial disease&#xD;
      undergo the Odyssey2 survey will address the following 7 questions. The first 6 are the same&#xD;
      as in Odyssey1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How much time typically elapses between when patients initially notice symptoms of a&#xD;
           mitochondrial disorder and when they receive the diagnosis of mitochondrial disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How many physicians do patients typically see before they receive the diagnosis of&#xD;
           mitochondrial disease?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. What testing do patients typically undergo?&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. What other diagnoses, if any, do patients typically receive?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. How did receiving a mitochondrial disease diagnosis impact the patient's life?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. If the patient were to learn that their mitochondrial disease diagnosis was incorrect,&#xD;
           what impact would that have?&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Have any of the above changed since Odyssey1 in the RDCRN results?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon collection, the survey data will be stored by the Rare Diseases Clinical Research&#xD;
      Network (RDCRN) Data Management and Coordinating Center (DMCC) at the University of South&#xD;
      Florida.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon conclusion of the study period, the data will be de-identified prior to being sent to&#xD;
      Dr. Seamus Thompson at the NAMDC Data Coordinating Center (DCC). The data will be analyzed by&#xD;
      a team which will include Drs. Thompson, Hirano, Karaa, and Yeske; and Ms. Shepard, the&#xD;
      project statistician. All data collected will be sent to a Federal data repository to be&#xD;
      stored indefinitely per the current RDCRN data sharing policy.&#xD;
