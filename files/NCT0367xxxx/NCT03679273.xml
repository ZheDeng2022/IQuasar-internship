  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) is the leading cause of non-traumatic limb loss in adult worldwide.&#xD;
      One of the major causes of limb loss in patients with DFU is poor wound healing. It is known&#xD;
      that nutrition plays a key role in wound healing, not only because of the required calories,&#xD;
      but more importantly for collagen remodeling by specific amino acids (arginine, glutamine,&#xD;
      and β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nevertheless, few studies have investigated nutritional supplements in patients with poor&#xD;
      wound healing of DFU. Difficulties in assessing the severity of a wound and poor adherence to&#xD;
      drug and food supplements at home may be important factors for the negative results shown in&#xD;
      a most recent prospective randomized controlled trial. The diabetic foot center in Chang Gung&#xD;
      Memorial hospital has extensive experience in caring for patients with limb-threatening DFU&#xD;
      and we recently reported that poor nutritional status in our patients correlated to poor&#xD;
      treatment outcomes. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical efficacy and possible&#xD;
      molecular mechanisms in nutritional treatment for limb-threatening DFU. A total of 70&#xD;
      patients will be enrolled and randomized into study and control groups. All subjects will&#xD;
      receive standard care. Additional amino acid supplements containing arginine, glutamine, and&#xD;
      β-hydroxy-β-methylbutyrate or a control (high protein formula powder) will be given orally&#xD;
      twice a day for 21 days, and the percentage change in wound size will then be measured.&#xD;
      Complete healing time, recurrence or major adverse cardiac events will be recorded during one&#xD;
      year of follow up. Data on wound size, nutritional status, and levels of matrix&#xD;
      metallopeptidase (MMP)-2, MMP-9, nutrient molecules (measured by ABSOLUTE/DQ P180 KIT (LC&#xD;
      MS/MS) will be recorded before and after the nutritional supplementation. In addition, the&#xD;
      pioneer factor forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2) that binds native chromatin and bookmarks&#xD;
      genomic regions for transcriptional activity may play a role in nutritional supplements in&#xD;
      acute stressed diabetic patients. Therefore, we intend to conduct a pilot study on the for&#xD;
      FOXA2 gene in maintaining glucose homeostasis in diabetic foot patients after nutritional&#xD;
      interventions.&#xD;
