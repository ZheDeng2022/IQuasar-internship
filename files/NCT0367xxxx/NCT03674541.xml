    <textblock>
      Myalgic encephalomyelitis/Chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS), otherwise known as Chronic&#xD;
      fatigue syndrome (CFS) or myalgic encephalomyelitis (ME), is an under-recognized disorder&#xD;
      whose cause is not yet understood. Suggested theories behind the pathophysiology of this&#xD;
      condition include autoimmune causes, an inciting viral illness, and a dysfunctional autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system caused by a small fiber polyneuropathy. Symptoms include fatigue, cognitive&#xD;
      impairments, gastrointestinal changes, exertional dyspnea, and post-exertional malaise. The&#xD;
      latter two symptoms are caused in part by abnormal cardiopulmonary hemodynamics during&#xD;
      exercise thought to be due to a small fiber polyneuropathy. This manifests as low&#xD;
      biventricular filling pressures throughout exercise seen in patients undergoing a level 3&#xD;
      CPET along with small nerve fiber atrophy seen on skin biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After diagnosis, patients are often treated with pyridostigmine (off-label use of this&#xD;
      medication) to enhance cholinergic stimulation of norepinephrine release at the&#xD;
      post-ganglionic synapse. This is thought to improve venoconstriction at the site of&#xD;
      exercising muscles, leading to improved return of blood to the heart and increasing filling&#xD;
      of the heart to more appropriate levels during peak exercise. Retrospective studies have&#xD;
      shown that noninvasive measurements of exercise capacity, such as oxygen uptake, end-tidal&#xD;
      carbon dioxide, and ventilatory efficiency, improve after treatment with pyridostigmine. To&#xD;
      date, there are no studies that assess invasive hemodynamics after pyridostigmine&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is estimated that four million people suffer from ME/CFS worldwide, a number that is&#xD;
      thought to be a gross underestimate of disease prevalence. However, despite its potential for&#xD;
      debilitating symptoms, loss of productivity, and worldwide burden, the pathophysiology behind&#xD;
      ME/CFS remains unknown and its treatment unclear. By evaluating the exercise response to&#xD;
      cholinergic stimulation, this study will shed further light on the link between the autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system and cardiopulmonary hemodynamics, potentially leading to new therapeutic&#xD;
      targets.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of our study is that hemodynamic, ventilatory and oxygen exchange variables&#xD;
      such biventricular filling pressures and systemic oxygen extraction can be improved by&#xD;
      cholinergic stimulation in patients with ME/CFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to examine the exercise response to pharmacologic cholinergic&#xD;
      stimulation in ME/CFS patients already undergoing a clinically indicated level 3&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET). This will be achieved by inhibiting&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase with pyridostigmine, thus increasing acetylcholine levels, downstream&#xD;
      levels of norepinephrine, and enhancing vascular regulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test our hypothesis, we propose the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Define the response of peak oxygen uptake (VO2) to pyridostigmine. Define the gas exchange&#xD;
      responses, such as end-tidal CO2 and ventilatory efficiency to pyridostigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Define the hemodynamic responses, such as right atrial pressures, pulmonary artery pressure,&#xD;
      pulmonary capillary wedge pressures, cardiac output, heart rate, stroke volume, pulmonary&#xD;
      vascular resistance and systemic vascular resistance to pyridostigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the response of skeletal muscle oxygen extraction and lactate to pyridostigmine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These determinations will occur during a clinically indicated level 3 CPET, which includes&#xD;
      exercising on a stationary cycle with a right heart catheter (RHC) and a radial arterial line&#xD;
      in place. To stimulate the cholinergic response, a single dose of an oral&#xD;
      acetylcholinesterase inhibitor, pyridostigmine, versus placebo will be given after the level&#xD;
      3 CPET. Recovery cycling will be performed after a rest period of 50 minutes. This will be&#xD;
      administered in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.&#xD;
