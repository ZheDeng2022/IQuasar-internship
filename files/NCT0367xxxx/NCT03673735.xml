  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase III randomized blind placebo-controlled study, designed to show the&#xD;
      superiority of the experimental arm to the control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After surgery and checking eligibility criteria, patients will be randomized between the&#xD;
      control and the experimental arms with a 1:1 ratio (randomization will take place at a&#xD;
      maximum 4 weeks after surgery):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Experimental Arm: Durvalumab (one dose) before chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and for 6 months&#xD;
           every 4 weeks (Q4W) after CRT&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Control Arm: placebo (one dose) before CRT and for 6 months Q4W after CRT Radiotherapy&#xD;
           planning will take place after randomization. The primary endpoint of this trial is&#xD;
           disease free survival (DFS), measured from the date of randomization to the date of&#xD;
           first occurrence of any loco-regional recurrence, metastatic progression, or death due&#xD;
           to any cause.&#xD;

    <description>Time to distant metastases is defined as the time interval between the date of randomization and the first date when distant disease is detected. Cumulative incidence of distant metastases is estimated considering death or diagnosis of loco-regional recurrence in absence of distant disease is considered as a competing risk event. If a recurrence is detected at the same time at both loco-regional and distant sites, this is considered as a competing risk for this endpoint.</description>

    <description>Time to loco-regional recurrence is the time interval between the date of randomization and the date where local or regional recurrence is first detected. Cumulative incidence of loco-regional recurrence is estimated considering death or diagnosis of distant metastases in absence of loca l or regional recurrence is considered as a competing risk event. If a recurrence is detected at the same time at both loco-regional and distant sites, this is considered as an event of interest for this endpoint.</description>

    <measure>Health-related quality of Life questionnaires: QLQ-C30</measure>

    <description>To compare the addition of immunotherapy to chemo-radiation therapy on health-related quality of life. Quality of life will be assessed with the EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) version 3.&#xD;
The EORTC Quality of Life Questionnaire (QLQ-C30) version 3 is patient questionnaire composed of 30 single questions which form 15 multi-item and single-item scales. These include five functional scales (physical, role, emotional, social, and cognitive), three multi-item symptom scales (fatigue, nausea and vomiting and pain), six single item symptom scales (dyspnea, insomnia, appetite loss, constipation, diarrhea and financial difficulties) and a global health status/QoL scale. The scoring algorithm for the scales results in a score from 0 to 100 where a high score for a functional scale represents a healthy level of functioning, but a high score for a symptom scale represents a high level of problems.</description>

    <description>Patients will receive 1 infusion of 1500 mg Durvalumab within 1 week prior to concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Chemoradiation should start within 6 weeks after surgery and within 1 week maximum of the induction phase. Radiation will consist of 33 fractions over 6 weeks for a total of 66 Gy.
