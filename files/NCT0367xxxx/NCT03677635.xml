  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      People with a diagnosis of psychosis often experience low motivation and pleasure when&#xD;
      thinking about doing future activities. This leads, quite understandably, to doing fewer&#xD;
      activities they used to enjoy and not taking up opportunities to do new activities. One model&#xD;
      suggests that this may be partly due to difficulties using memories of previous events to&#xD;
      help boost motivation and anticipation before a future activity. Research shows that people&#xD;
      with psychosis may recall previous events in less detail. These memories therefore may not be&#xD;
      as helpful as they could be for motivation. This study will investigate this by asking people&#xD;
      with experience of psychosis and low motivation who are seen by a care team in South London&#xD;
      and Maudsley NHS Trust to attend two research sessions. In the first session they will be&#xD;
      asked to recall memories of events from their lives and the researcher will assess how&#xD;
      detailed they are and how much they refer to the past and future. Alongside this task people&#xD;
      will also be asked to complete measures of symptoms such as low pleasure and motivation as&#xD;
      well as a measure of depression. These will be used to find out if the detail and specificity&#xD;
      of the memories are related to these symptoms in people with psychosis. The second half of&#xD;
      the study will then investigate whether additional prompts to support positive memory&#xD;
      retrieval can increase the specificity of this and subsequently improve mood, motivation and&#xD;
      self-belief. Participants will be randomised to one of two groups. The clinical group will be&#xD;
      guided through their memory recall using prompts and a control group will be asked to recall&#xD;
      positive memories without prompts. If we show that supporting memory recall is beneficial&#xD;
      then memories for past events may be an important target for future therapies.&#xD;
