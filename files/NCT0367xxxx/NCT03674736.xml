  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study is being done so we can determine the quality of the protein present in&#xD;
      Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas and Lentils. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and&#xD;
      protein quality is determined by the amount of amino acids present and by their&#xD;
      bioavailability (their absorption and use by the body). Some amino acids are essential which&#xD;
      means they must be obtained from the diet. If any one of the essential amino acids is missing&#xD;
      in the diet, the body cannot make proteins that are used to repair tissue build bone, teeth,&#xD;
      etcâ€¦ Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas and Lentils as a food source contain low amounts of the essential&#xD;
      amino acid methionine (Chickpeas and Lentils) and lysine (Rice and Wheat) which makes its&#xD;
      protein incomplete. The amino acids in Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas and Lentils are also affected&#xD;
      by cooking. Our objective is to determine the amount of methionine in Rice and Wheat and the&#xD;
      amount of lysine in Chickpeas and Lentils that the body can use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done in order to bridge the gap between knowledge of protein&#xD;
      requirement and the amount of food needed to meet that requirement. Results from this study&#xD;
      will be important for recommendations guiding food choices of Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas and&#xD;
      Lentils as a major protein source in the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously the quality of dietary protein for human consumption was studied in animals. This&#xD;
      study is being done in humans because studies in animals are not always directly applicable&#xD;
      to humans. Plant protein sources like rice, wheat, chickpeas and lentils are important&#xD;
      protein sources shown to &quot;enhance ecosystem resilience, and improve human health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you agree to take part in this study, you will participate in 7 different experiments for&#xD;
      each food. For each food you will receive 3 different amounts of Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas or&#xD;
      Lentils which will contain different amounts of the essential amino acid methionine (Rice or&#xD;
      Wheat) or lysine (Chickpeas or Lentils).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quality of the protein in the Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas or Lentils will be compared to the&#xD;
      quality of a reference protein (egg protein) by giving you 4 reference diets containing amino&#xD;
      acids made up like the amino acids in egg protein. The amount of Rice, Wheat, Chickpeas or&#xD;
      Lentils you receive will be provided in a random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each experiments will be conduced over 3 days- 2 adaptation days where you will receive the&#xD;
      diets at home, provided by the investigators and 1 study day. On the 3rd day (study day) you&#xD;
      will visit the Clinical Research Center (CRC) at the Hospital for Sick Children where you&#xD;
      will receive 9 hourly meals. Breath samples will be collected after the 4th meal in 15 min&#xD;
      intervals for 1 hour. Breath collection will resume again two and a half hours after the 5th&#xD;
      meal every 15 minutes until 30 minutes after the last meal. A total of 52 breath samples will&#xD;
      be collected during each of the 3rd study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study begins, you will visit the CRC at the Hospital for Sick Children for a&#xD;
      baseline study assessment. At that time your body composition (fat and fat-free mass) will be&#xD;
      measured and your resting energy expenditure will be measured. This will tell us the amount&#xD;
      of calories your body need so we can prepare the diets for you for each experiment. This&#xD;
      baseline assessment takes about 2 hours.&#xD;
