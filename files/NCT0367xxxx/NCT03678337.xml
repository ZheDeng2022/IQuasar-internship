  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Recently, the medical management of cancer patients has considerably improved the prognosis&#xD;
      of these patients and today some cancers are becoming &quot;chronic diseases&quot;. As a result, new&#xD;
      adverse effects (AEs) are observed, particularly cardiac.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These &quot;new&quot; cardiac AEs are the consequence of a significant increase in patients life&#xD;
      expectancy (delayed AEs not previously seen) but also the use of new pharmacological classes&#xD;
      of anticancer drugs such as kinase inhibitors. The incidence of these cardiac AEs varies&#xD;
      according to the patient profile and the anticancer molecules used, but their impact on the&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality of the patients is significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this context, we started at the University Hospital of Caen Normandy in September 2017 a&#xD;
      cardio-oncology program entitled &quot;prevention and pharmacological management of cardiac&#xD;
      adverse effects induced by drugs used in Oncology&quot; (PICARO program). This program involves&#xD;
      the pharmacology department (opening of a dedicated consultation), the cardiology department&#xD;
      (opening of a dedicated ultrasound consultation), vascular medicine departement (opening of a&#xD;
      dedicated consultation) and the oncology federation. This program aims to be regional in the&#xD;
      future. We therefore propose to build a cohort backed up to the PICARO program to assess the&#xD;
      regional impact of cardiac AEs of anticancer drugs and thus to be better able to specify the&#xD;
      number of AEs, the incidence and regional prevalence of these drugs. .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The constitution of this cohort is only the first step towards the constitution in the near&#xD;
      future (2 years) of an observatory and then a regional registry of cardiac AEs induced by&#xD;
      anticancer drugs. The objectives associated with the establishment of such a registry would&#xD;
      be to reduce the number of cardiac AEs, the hospitalizations caused by these AEs, a better&#xD;
      information of health professionals and patients, an improvement in the screening of patients&#xD;
      at risk, all coming back in the context of health, clinical, epidemiological and&#xD;
      pharmacological surveillance.&#xD;
