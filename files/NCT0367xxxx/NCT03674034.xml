      This is a retrospective study based on the images contained in the database of the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Amiens. There is no further examination. Electroencephalography (EEG) and&#xD;
      Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS). These sources are widely used to specify the source of&#xD;
      certain evoked potentials or to better define the sources of epileptic graphoelements,&#xD;
      especially in the pre-surgical assessment of refractory epilepsies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is therefore important that these regions are more widely available in the constitution of&#xD;
      the world, and that they are suitable for use in the design of new technologies. Although MRI&#xD;
      is the gold standard for soft tissue segmentation, it is not suitable for bone extraction;&#xD;
      especially in the newborn or the bone is very thin. On the other hand, CTscan is an excellent&#xD;
      method for extracting bone. The contrast between bone and soft tissue is excellent. In this&#xD;
      case, with the CTscan, the fontanelles are identified as discontinuities between the images&#xD;
      of the temporal scales.&#xD;

      Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and brain scan (CT Scan) are the two main modalities of&#xD;
      structural brain imaging that are widely used in routine practice. The extraction of bone&#xD;
      from MRI and CTscan images is an important step in the segmentation of the different tissues&#xD;
      of the subjects' heads. It is indeed necessary to know precisely the electrical&#xD;
      characteristics (conductivities) and optical (absorption, diffraction) of tissues (skin,&#xD;
      bone, LCS, gray matter and white matter), or by electric currents or by photons. One of the&#xD;
      major problems is the one that is not very poorly visualized in MRIs in CTscan, the bone is&#xD;
      well individualized and that inversely the various brain structures are difficult to extract.&#xD;
      This justifies the fact of performing a coregistration of images obtained in MRI and CTscan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The skull of the newborn is an inhomogeneous structure. The fontanelles are invisible in MRI&#xD;
      and identifiable in CTscan.&#xD;

    <description>The objective of this study is to evaluate a model-based approach for extracting fontanel from CTscan images. Then, recalibrate these CT scan images in a unique repository with MRI images to obtain a composite image of different brain tissues such as brain, LCS and skin (MRI) and bone and fontanelle (CTscan).</description>
