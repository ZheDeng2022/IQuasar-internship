    <textblock>
      Although asthma is a disease of the airways, research is now showing that asthmatics are more&#xD;
      likely to develop cardiovascular disease (CVD) compared to non-asthmatics. Vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction is seen in people at high risk of CVD and has been linked to inflammation. During&#xD;
      an asthma attack, levels of inflammation in the whole body increase, which could potentially&#xD;
      explain why asthmatics are at increased risk of CVD. In the proposed study the investigators&#xD;
      will examine if asthma attacks lead to increased risk of CVD by evaluating inflammatory&#xD;
      levels and vascular function directly following asthma attacks, 2 days and 14 days after&#xD;
      discharge. The investigators will compare these results to non-asthmatics. The results from&#xD;
      this study will help us understand why asthmatics are at increased risk of CVD.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND &amp; SCOPE: While asthma is generally considered to be a disease of the airways,&#xD;
      there are important systemic consequences which have predisposed people with asthma to become&#xD;
      more likely to die from cardiovascular (CV) disease compared to non-asthmatics. Additional CV&#xD;
      risks have been reported in people with severe asthma, and there is a relationship between&#xD;
      reductions in lung function and cardiac death. To date, little is known in regards to the&#xD;
      interaction between an asthma exacerbation and CV risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachial flow-mediated dilation (FMD) is used as a non-invasive tool to evaluate endothelial&#xD;
      function. Brachial FMD is impaired in people with coronary dysfunction, and has been shown to&#xD;
      predict future CV events better than traditional CV risk factors. People with asthma have&#xD;
      previously been shown to have impaired endothelial function compared to non-asthmatics, but&#xD;
      the underlying mechanism(s) are unclear. The aim of this study is to evaluate the endothelial&#xD;
      function in people with asthma directly following an asthma exacerbation, 2 days and 14 days&#xD;
      post-exacerbation, as well as non asthmatic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Applanation tonometry is a non-invasive tool to evaluate arterial stiffness. It measure the&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity (PWV), which is an independent predictor of cardiovascular risk. People&#xD;
      with asthma have previously been shown to have increased arterial stiffness compared to&#xD;
      non-asthmatics, but hte underlying mechanism(s) are unclear. Arterial stiffness will be&#xD;
      evaluated in people with asthma directly following an asthma exacerbation, 2 days and 14 days&#xD;
      post-exacerbation, as well as non asthmatic controls. Arterial stiffness, together with&#xD;
      endothelial function will give information on the vascular function of the individuals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic systemic inflammation is an established risk factor and predictor of future CV&#xD;
      events, and levels of systemic inflammation has been shown to be increased in asthma and to&#xD;
      be are related to disease severity. While systemic inflammation can directly impair vascular&#xD;
      function, it is unknown how an asthma attack may affect vascular function and CV risk. Thus,&#xD;
      to gain better understanding of the increased CV risks associated with an asthma&#xD;
      exacerbation, this study will evaluate the level of systemic inflammation in people with&#xD;
      asthma directly following an asthma exacerbation, 2 days and 14 days post-exacerbation, as&#xD;
      well as non asthmatic controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVE 1: To examine the vascular function and systemic inflammation in young adults&#xD;
      experiencing a naturally occurring asthma exacerbation and to compare these data to values&#xD;
      obtained from two follow up visits, as well as to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS &amp; PROCEDURES: Outline:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant from the exacerbation group will be tested at three different times: Day 1)&#xD;
      ED visit, Day 2) 48 hours post ED, Day 3) 14 days post ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A waist circumference measurement will be taken. Waist circumference will be measured at the&#xD;
      level of the last rib to the nearest 0.1 cm after a normal expiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 1, participants will be recruited by the Emergency Medicine Research Group (EMeRG).&#xD;
      They will receive standard emergency care for their asthma and once stabilized, informed&#xD;
      consent will be obtained. Once stabilized, the participant will be taken to a private area&#xD;
      within the ED department to ensure no interference with ED procedures. Applanation tonometry&#xD;
      will be done to measure PWV, followed by brachial FMD to determine endothelial function and&#xD;
      lastly a blood sample will be obtained to measure serum CRP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 2 the participant will return and the same assessments as Day 1 will be performed with&#xD;
      the addition of spirometry. A FitBit will be given along with instructions to wear the device&#xD;
      for 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 3 will consist of the same measurements done in the ED for Day 1, with the addition of 2&#xD;
      quality of life questionnaires, the standardized Asthma Quality of Life Questionnaire (AQLQs)&#xD;
      and the EQ-5D (5L), and the Asthma Control Questionnaire (ACQ), finishing with a pulmonary&#xD;
      function test. Healthy controls will be tested two times, 48 hours apart. The same&#xD;
      assessments as the exacerbation group will be done, but no FitBit or questionnaires will be&#xD;
      given.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spirometry: the participant will be tested for significant airway reversibility as per&#xD;
      established clinical guidelines&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pulmonary function: A standard pulmonary function test will be performed by all participants&#xD;
      as per established clinical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systemic inflammation and immune response markers present in venous blood samples will be&#xD;
      analyzed at the University of Alberta.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular function: Flow-mediated dilation (FMD) of the brachial artery following 5 minutes of&#xD;
      forearm occlusion will be measured ultrasound imaging using our ultrasound machine. FMD will&#xD;
      be determined using Doppler ultrasound immediately after the release of the occlusion. The&#xD;
      secondary outcome is arterial stiffness, which will be determined using carotid - radial&#xD;
      pulse wave velocity, and PWV will be calculated from measurements of pulse transit time and&#xD;
      the distance traveled by the pulse between recording sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Activity: will be measure with a FitBit activity monitored and calculated as average&#xD;
      steps/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires: will asses asthma control, disease specific quality of life, and generalized&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mean differences in FMD, systemic inflammation, and arterial stiffness for ED visit&#xD;
      compared to the control group will be evaluated using an unpaired t-test. A within-factors&#xD;
      repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) will evaluate the mean differences between&#xD;
      each assessment day for the exacerbation group to assess change in endothelial function&#xD;
      during exacerbation as well as the recovery period. A similar evaluation will be used for&#xD;
      arterial stiffness and systemic inflammation. A one-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) will&#xD;
      be used to correct for shear rate in FMD for all groups, with both values being reported. A&#xD;
      Pearson correlation will be used to determine any relationship between recovery rate and&#xD;
      physical activity levels. In an exploratory sub analysis, unpaired t-tests will be used to&#xD;
      evaluate the sex differences for each outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An α-level of 0.05 will be used as the significance level for all statistical analysis, and&#xD;
      all results will be reported as mean ± standard deviation unless indicated otherwise.While&#xD;
      the impact of asthma exacerbations on vascular function is currently unknown, sample size&#xD;
      calculations based on preliminary velocity-time integral (VTI) data from 11 confirmed&#xD;
      asthmatics who underwent mannitol and placebo challenges indicate a total of 36 asthmatics&#xD;
      and 36 controls would be sufficient to detect a 13% difference between these groups in VTI.&#xD;
      Our preliminary data show a large increase in CRP in asthmatics experiencing an exacerbation&#xD;
      vs. stable patients (7.3 vs. 0.5 mg/L, p&lt;0.05), which would correspond to a substantial&#xD;
      increase in CV risk, and be detectable with this sample size. An additional 8 participants&#xD;
      per group will be recruited (i.e. 44 asthmatics and 44 controls) to compensate for potential&#xD;
      dropouts. Sub-analyses evaluating potential sex-based differences will be exploratory and&#xD;
      results will be considered hypothesis-generating.&#xD;
