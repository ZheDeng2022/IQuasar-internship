      The aim is to assess the efficacy of adding on a Mindfulness-based therapy to pharmacological&#xD;
      prophylaxis (experimental group: pharmacological prophylaxis + Mindfulness) against&#xD;
      pharmacological prophylaxis only (control group) on the reduction of monthly headaches&#xD;
      frequency (primary endpoint), symptomatic medications intake, inflammatory pattern,&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, cutaneous allodynia, improving disability and quality of life (secondary&#xD;
      endpoints). Moreover, other aims are to assess whether adding on Mindfulness-based therapy is&#xD;
      also associated to a superior improvement of neuroimaging pattern among patients prescribed&#xD;
      neuromodulators or antidepressants and to assess the cost-efficacy of adding on a&#xD;
      Mindfulness-based therapy to pharmacological prophylaxis. Mindfulness will be provided in&#xD;
      small groups (5-7 patients each) by specifically trained therapists. The treatment consists&#xD;
      in six 45 minutes weekly sessions in which one will work on meditation, acceptance and&#xD;
      awareness. The program of control group will consist in education of patients, followed by&#xD;
      pharmacological prophylaxis. Prophylaxis is prescribed based on patients' profile, such as&#xD;
      previous failures, contraindications and so on by a neurologist with expertise in headache&#xD;
      treatments. We expect that adding-on Mindfulness will determine a wider reduction of&#xD;
      headaches frequency and improvement of secondary endpoints, and that disease cost reduction&#xD;
      will support the cost-efficacy of Mindfulness. The study will be a Phase III; randomized,&#xD;
      Open-Label; Monocentric study. Patients will be enrolled to detect a 20% difference between&#xD;
      the two groups on the primary outcome (50% or more of headache reduction by 12 months). For&#xD;
      each medication type and research arm 20 patients will be selected: thus 80 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled for neuroradiological investigation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background and significance. Chronic migraine (CM) is a negative evolution of migraine&#xD;
      characterized by frequent headache attacks (&gt;45 days/three months) with a 1-year prevalence&#xD;
      of 3.1%. Comorbidities, lifestyle and excessive intakes of symptomatic medications&#xD;
      (medication overuse-MO) play a role in progression into CM; altered inflammatory state (WBC,&#xD;
      peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19) and dysfunctions in the&#xD;
      mesocorticolimbic dopamine circuit were found in CMMO patients. To prevent CM-MO relapse,&#xD;
      withdrawal of overused drugs and complementing pharmacological prophylaxis with behavioral&#xD;
      treatments is indicated [5]. Withdrawal from MO and medical prophylaxis determine a 30-40%&#xD;
      reduction in headaches frequency by 12 months, and 40-50% of patients show a reduction &gt;=50%.&#xD;
      Conversely, 30% of them relapse into CM-MO by 12 months: the main drivers include overuse of&#xD;
      analgesic compared to triptans and being on medical therapy alone compared to adjuvant&#xD;
      psychological techniques. Research demonstrated the utility of relaxation training, stress&#xD;
      management, cognitive-behavioral therapy in migraine disorder. Parallel to this, mindfulness&#xD;
      showed considerable promise particularly on headache-related disability, affective distress:&#xD;
      however, to date evidence of its efficacy is limited by small trials, short follow-up&#xD;
      periods, inadequate power and poor consideration of primary outcomes for CM research, i.e.&#xD;
      reduction of headaches frequency. Our main hypothesis is that mindfulness might provide&#xD;
      additional benefit, when added to medical prophylaxis alone, on both primary (i.e. an&#xD;
      increased number of patients showing a reduction of headaches frequency &gt;=50%) and secondary&#xD;
      outcomes: reduction in the consumption of symptomatic medications (i.e. analgesics, triptans,&#xD;
      opioids, ergot-derivate), reduction of disability, depression, anxiety and cutaneous&#xD;
      allodynia, improvement in quality of life; reduction of costs, connected to both lower direct&#xD;
      medical costs (e.g. drugs consumption and attendance to ER) and indirect costs (i.e.&#xD;
      reduction in lost workdays and improved workplace efficiency); reduction in concentration of&#xD;
      the markers of inflammatory pattern; reversible neuroadaptations highlighted by functional&#xD;
      connectivity in regions of dopaminergic circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be a Phase III; randomized, Open-Label; Monocentric study. Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled to detect a 20% difference between the two groups on the primary outcome (50% or&#xD;
      more of headache reduction by 12 months). We set alpha 0.05 and power 80%, and foresee that&#xD;
      up to 12% of patients might be lost at follow-up: therefore, we determined that 170 patients&#xD;
      should be randomized 1:1 to the two groups. Patients will be excluded if they: have&#xD;
      psychiatric comorbidities of psychotic area; pregnancy; comorbidity with secondary headaches&#xD;
      (e.g. idiopathic intracranial hypertension); were submitted to withdrawal from MO at least&#xD;
      twice in the previous two years; attended any mindfulness-based therapy. For each medication&#xD;
      type and research arm 20 patients will be selected: thus 80 patients will be enrolled for&#xD;
      neuroradiological investigation. The treatment consists in six 45 minutes weekly sessions.&#xD;
      The main focus of the six session will be the following: 1) introduction and meaning; 2)&#xD;
      Focus on breath; 3) posture and body awareness; 4) meditation of sounds; 5) Guided imagery;&#xD;
      6) acceptance and awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our project is highly innovative as it will be the first time in which a new emerging&#xD;
      treatment like Mindfulness is tested for its efficacy and cost-efficacy when added to&#xD;
      standard pharmacological prophylaxis. If our hypothesis will be confirmed, then we will&#xD;
      positively impact on: a) clinicians, that will have confirmation of another valid adjuvant&#xD;
      treatment option; b) national health system, that will cut down the relevant costs of&#xD;
      medication intake and indirect costs associated to reduced productivity; c) patients, that&#xD;
      will enhance their ability to cope with headaches and improve their overall health, quality&#xD;
      of life, work-ability and reduce their disability. Moreover, our study will address the&#xD;
      possible impact of Mindfulness as an add-on to pharmacological prophylaxis not only on&#xD;
      clinical data, such as headaches frequency and symptomatic medications intake, but also on&#xD;
      biomarkers of inflammatory and functional neuroimaging patterns.&#xD;

    <description>Change in quality of life, assessed with the Migraine-Specific Quality of Life Questionnaire 2.1 (MSQ 2.1) The MSQ is a 14-item instrument that measures the impact of migraine across three essential aspects of a patient's health-related quality of life over the past 4 weeks: role function-restrictive (7 items assessing how migraines limit one's daily social and work-related activities) , role function-preventive (4 items assessing how migraines prevent these activities), and emotional function (3 items assessing the emotions associated with migraines). Participant respond to items using a 6-point scale: &quot;none of the time,&quot; &quot;a little bit of the time,&quot; &quot;some of the time,&quot; &quot;a good bit of the time,&quot; &quot;most of the time,&quot; and &quot;all of the time,&quot; which are assigned scores of 1 to 6, respectively. Raw dimension scores are computed as a sum of item responses and rescaled from a 0 to 100 scale such that higher scores indicate better quality of life.</description>
