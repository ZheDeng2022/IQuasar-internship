    <textblock>
      This research study is studying a drug as a possible treatment for Bronchiolitis Obliterans&#xD;
      Syndrome (BOS) after having an Allogeneic Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial. Phase II clinical trials test the safety&#xD;
      and effectiveness of an investigational drug to learn whether the drug works in treating a&#xD;
      specific disease. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA (the U.S. Food and Drug Administration) has not approved ruxolitinib for this&#xD;
      specific disease but it has been approved for other uses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators are assessing the safety and effectiveness of ruxolitinib&#xD;
      when given to participants who have been diagnosed with BOS after HCT. BOS is a sign/symptom&#xD;
      of chronic Graft-vs-Host Disease (GVHD), a condition in which cells from the donor's tissue&#xD;
      attack the organs after HCT occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruxolitinib blocks certain proteins called tyrosine kinases. Specifically, it blocks tyrosine&#xD;
      kinases called JAK2. The investigators believe that ruxolitinib may lower the rate of GVHD&#xD;
      through its ability to block the JAK2 pathway since this pathway can lead to inflammation in&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of BOS after HCT defined when all of the following criteria are met (as&#xD;
             defined by the 2014 NIH criteria):&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  FEV1/VC &lt; 0.7 or the 5th percentile of predicted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  FEV1 = Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  VC = Vital Capacity (Forced Vital Capacity &quot;FVC&quot; or Slow Vital Capacity &quot;SVC&quot;,&#xD;
                  whichever is greater)&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The 5th percentile of predicted is the lower limit of the 90% confidence&#xD;
                  interval.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  For elderly patients, use the lower limits of normal defined according to&#xD;
                  NHANESIII calculations.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  FEV1 &lt;75% of predicted with ≥ 10% absolute decline over less than 2 years. FEV1&#xD;
                  should not correct to &gt;75% of predicted with albuterol, and the absolute decline&#xD;
                  for the corrected values should still remain ≥ 10% over 2 years. The remote&#xD;
                  comparator would be an evaluation of PFTs done within 2 years of the PFTs&#xD;
                  assessment being evaluated to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Absence of active infection in the respiratory tract, documented with&#xD;
                  investigations directed by clinical symptoms, such as chest radiographs or&#xD;

                  bronchiectasis by high-resolution chest CT OR&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Evidence of air trapping by PFTs: RV (Residual Volume) &gt; 120% of predicted or&#xD;
                  RV/TLC elevated outside the 90% confidence interval (RV/Total Lung Capacity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Life expectancy &gt; 6 months at the time of enrollment as judged by the enrolling&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female; 18-75 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG Performance Status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks since initiation of the most recent systemic therapy for cGVHD or BOS&#xD;

             B surface antigen positive or anti-hepatitis B core antibody positive. Subjects with&#xD;
             previous positive serology results must have negative polymerase chain reaction&#xD;
             results. Subjects whose immune status is unknown or uncertain must have results&#xD;
             confirming immune status before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe organ dysfunction unrelated to underlying GVHD, including: Cholestatic&#xD;
             disorders or unresolved veno-occlusive disease of the liver (defined as persistent&#xD;
             bilirubin abnormalities not attributable to GVHD and ongoing organ dysfunction).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant or uncontrolled cardiac disease, including unstable angina,&#xD;
             acute myocardial infarction within 6 months from Day 1 of study drug administration,&#xD;
             New York Heart Association Class III or IV congestive heart failure, circulatory&#xD;
             collapse requiring vasopressor or inotropic support, or arrhythmia that requires&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically active asthma (variable and recurring symptoms of airflow obstruction and&#xD;
             bronchial hyper-responsiveness), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, interstitial&#xD;
             lung disease, or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia or other causes of restrictive lung&#xD;
             disease such as neuromuscular weakness or diaphragmatic paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with the&#xD;
             subject's ability to comply with the study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled substance abuse or psychiatric disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Deemed (by the local PI or the PFT lab) unable to reliably perform pulmonary function&#xD;
             tests.&#xD;
