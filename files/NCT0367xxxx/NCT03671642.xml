      This study will investigate a new method to assess tissue perfusion during surgery for&#xD;
      esophageal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When a tumor in the distal esophagus is removed, the ends of the esophagus and the stomach&#xD;
      must be reconnected by an anastomosis. An optimal perfusion is essential to ensure a good&#xD;
      healing of the anastomosis. If anastomotic leakage occurs, it may prolong hospital stay,&#xD;
      increase the risk of serious complications and death, delay start-up of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      worsen the long-term survival prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the operation the blood supply to the ends of the esophagus and stomach will be&#xD;
      assessed in different ways; The traditional where the surgeon looks and feels on the tissue,&#xD;
      and newer methods with an indocyanine green and cameras that illuminate the tissue with&#xD;
      near-infrared light. The surgeon will assess whether these methods change the decision on&#xD;
      where the ends should be sewn together.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An optimal perfusion is essential in gastrointestinal surgery when resection of a cancerous&#xD;
      tissue requires an anastomosis, since impaired perfusion seems to be associated with&#xD;
      increased risk of anastomotic leakage (AL). AL is a severe complication with the risk of;&#xD;
      prolonged hospital stay, cancer recurrence, permanent stoma in colorectal surgery, and&#xD;
      increased short and long-term mortality. To avoid poor perfusion of an anastomosis, perfusion&#xD;
      assessment is necessary during the operative procedure. Traditionally, perfusion is assessed&#xD;
      visually and manually by the surgeon by judging the; color of the tissue, bleeding from the&#xD;
      resection line, and the arterial supply pulse by palpation. These methods have earlier been&#xD;
      shown to be unreliable and prone to observer bias. Furthermore, palpation of arterial supply&#xD;
      is not possible in laparoscopic or robot-assisted surgery, and the increased use of staplers&#xD;
      to divide the bowel leaves no bleeding resection lines. Therefore newer methods for perfusion&#xD;
      assessment have been investigated, and fluorescence angiography (FA) and laser speckle&#xD;
      contrast imaging (LSCI) has shown very promising results. In a systematic review of&#xD;
      nonrandomized studies, the leakage rate in 916 colorectal resections was significantly lower&#xD;
      when using FA compared to controls (3.3%, [95% CI: 1.97-4.63%] vs 8.5%, [95% CI: 4.8-12.2%],&#xD;
      p=0.0055).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In FA, the tissue of interest is exposed to near-infrared (NIR) light simultaneously with&#xD;
      intravenous injection of a fluorescent dye. When the dye reaches the illuminated area, it&#xD;
      fluoresces, and a camera with a special filter can visualize the microcirculation of the&#xD;
      tissue on a monitor. Many NIR-camera systems are on the market, combining the technique with&#xD;
      conventional laparoscopic or robotic equipment, and several non-randomized studies have&#xD;
      indicated that FA may reduce the anastomotic leakage rate in gastrointestinal surgery. Most&#xD;
      surgeons are using only a visual subjective assessment of the FA, which may be prone to&#xD;
      observer bias. Moreover, if the camera is not held at a standard distance from the tissue, or&#xD;
      a different concentration of dye is used, a false negative or positive assessment of the&#xD;
      perfusion may be made. Therefore, it has been argued that there is a need for an objective&#xD;
      unbiased quantitative assessment tool in FA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A quantification algorithm that provides a fluorescence-time curve and a quantitative&#xD;
      parameter of perfusion, the normalized slope has previously been published, where a nearly&#xD;
      linear correlation to regional flow was found. Until now measurements has been performed as&#xD;
      analyses of video-recordings after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to use the method in a clinical setting, development and testing of a tool that may&#xD;
      be operated by the surgeon during the procedure to perform perioperative measurements is of&#xD;
      high importance. A touchscreen tablet has been developed, in order to perform live&#xD;
      perioperative quantitative perfusion assessment using FA. The tool may be used with several&#xD;
      systems including Karl Storz fluorescence laparoscopic equipment and the daVinci SI or XI&#xD;
      from Intuitive. This tool is essential in order to implement the technology into daily&#xD;
      practice, as it allows the surgeon to get an immediate quantitative parameter of perfusion&#xD;
      (normalized slope) at desired regions of interest. The interface of the tool should be easy&#xD;
      to use and provide fluorescence-time curves to control the automated calculation of the&#xD;
      normalized slope. In addition, a color-coded map of perfusion intensity should be provided as&#xD;
      an overlay on the white light picture of the bowel investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The touchscreen tablet has currently only been tested in animal surgery. The aim of the&#xD;
      present study is to investigate if the use of a perioperative quantitative perfusion&#xD;
      assessment tool may improve the perfusion assessment during surgery in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perioperative perfusion assessment with FA will change the point of resection determined&#xD;
           by conventional visual perfusion assessment in GI junctional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Quantitative perfusion assessment with FA (Q-ICG) will further change the point of&#xD;
           resection determined by visual assessment of the FA and conventional visual assessment&#xD;
           of perfusion in GI junctional procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Feasibility of perfusion assessment with traditional visual, visual FA, and Q-ICG -&#xD;
           complied by completion rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The feasibility and usability of the tool, the surgeons' experiences with the&#xD;
           Q-ICG-tablet interface - rated on a validated questionnaire, the System Usability Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      â€¢ Differences in the distance from the determined resection points using traditional&#xD;
      assessment, FA, and Q-ICG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted as an observational feasibility and usability trial in patients&#xD;
      undergoing open or robot-assisted resection of the gastroesophageal junction (GI junction) in&#xD;
      a single university hospital center (Rigshospitalet, Department of Surgical&#xD;
      Gastroenterology). Patients will serve as their own control. Demographic information&#xD;
      (tumor-staging, gender, age, BMI, neoadjuvant treatment, ASA-classification, smoking,&#xD;
      alcohol, medication etc.) will be collected from the electronic patient records. In addition,&#xD;
      postoperative events, especially the presence of an anastomotic leakage, will be noted 30&#xD;
      days postoperatively. No formal sample size calculation has been performed as the study is a&#xD;
      feasibility study. 20 patients will be included. Participating patients will receive the same&#xD;
      standard post- and peri-operative care and follow-up as patients not included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Indocyanine green Indocyanine green (ICG) is a well-described nontoxic tricarbocyanine dye&#xD;
      used for decades in ophthalmology, cardiology, and hepatology. Very few mild adverse&#xD;
      reactions have been reported, but caution in patients with thyrotoxicosis, allergy towards&#xD;
      iodine or indocyanine green should be made. When injected intravenously it binds to blood&#xD;
      lipoproteins and is solely metabolized by the liver and excreted in the bile, with a short&#xD;
      half-life of approximately 4-5 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical procedure and perfusion assessment When the dissection and division of the feeding&#xD;
      blood vessels are complete and the gastric conduit established and drawn to the thorax, the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal surgeon will choose the most proximal point possible on the conduit for the&#xD;
      anastomosis (Anastomotic point surgeon, APS) by pointing while a picture is captured, blinded&#xD;
      for the thoracic surgeon. A sterile paper ruler will be introduced to the thorax, in order to&#xD;
      measure the distance between the chosen resection points. Then, LSCI measurement of the&#xD;
      conduit is performed, and finally, a bolus of ICG (0.25 mg/kg body weight) will be injected&#xD;
      intravenously and flushed with 5 mL of saline, and the tissue of interest exposed to&#xD;
      NIR-light (excitation wavelength 750-800 nm) and emission observed at 800 nm (FA). During the&#xD;
      video-captures of LSCI and ICG-FA, the respiration will be paused for a maximum of 20 seconds&#xD;
      initiated at the moment of saline injection. After the FA the thoracic surgeon will by visual&#xD;
      assessment determine and mark a new anastomotic point by pointing at the most proximal point&#xD;
      possible on the conduit for the anastomosis, while a picture is taken (anastomotic point&#xD;
      fluorescence angiography, APFA). After the quantitative FA the surgeon will again mark an&#xD;
      anastomotic point (APQFA). The final anastomotic point will be chosen by the primary&#xD;
      gastrointestinal and the thoracic surgeon, and if the assessment of FA or quantitative FA&#xD;
      will influence this decision is solely up to the surgeon. The same points will be marked on&#xD;
      the LSCI picture but not revealed to the surgeon since the quantitative assessment of the&#xD;
      LSCI demands on post hoc data-analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When the surgeon decides how much tissue to resect to ensure an optimal anastomotic&#xD;
      perfusion, care must be taken not to cause tension to the anastomosis by resecting too much&#xD;
      of the gastric conduit or the esophagus, as tension is a known risk factor of anastomotic&#xD;
      leakage. Again, the level of resection is solely decided by the surgeon and this decision&#xD;
      should, as always, be made by balancing factors of tension, perfusion, and excessive tissue&#xD;
      loss - all combined to ensure an optimal anastomotic healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic fluorescence angiography A laparoscope (ICG-Hopkins telescope 30Â°, 10 mm, Karl&#xD;
      Storz Gmbh and Co. KG, TÃ¼ttlingen, Germany) will be connected to a camera system (IMAGE1,&#xD;
      Karl Storz Gmbh and Co. KG, TÃ¼ttlingen, Germany) and a light-source (D-light P, Karl Storz&#xD;
      Gmbh and Co. KG, TÃ¼ttlingen, Germany) will supply the excitatory light and record the FA. The&#xD;
      laparoscope will be fixed in a mechanical holding arm 10 cm from the tissue of interest,&#xD;
      ensuring a stable position throughout the experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robot-assisted fluorescence angiography A surgical robot DaVinci SI (Intuitive Surgical Inc.,&#xD;
      Sunnyvale, CA, USA) and the Firefly Fluorescence Imaging system will be used. The camera will&#xD;
      be fixed 10 cm from the tissue of interest, ensuring a stable position throughout the&#xD;
      experiment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative fluorescence angiography (Q-ICG) A video capture device (Av.io HDâ„¢, Epiphan&#xD;
      video, California, USA) will be connected to the surgical robot or the laparoscopic camera&#xD;
      system and transfer the video capture to a tablet (Microsoft Surface Pro4 I5, Microsoft,&#xD;
      Redmond, WA, USA). A program developed to quantify the FA will be installed. Here the&#xD;
      operator can choose regions of interest to quantify from the captured video sequence. A color&#xD;
      grading of perfusion will be provided as well as quantitative values from specific points.&#xD;
      From this assessment, the surgeon will again determine a new resection point (APQFA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of resection points The distance from the tumor to the RPS will be measured before&#xD;
      the FA using the paper ruler. In addition, the distance from the APS to APFA and APQFA will&#xD;
      be measured using the ruler, either during the procedure or post hoc using the video-capture.&#xD;
      The comparison of the distance will be made on the distance of each point from the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Feasibility The feasibility will be investigated by comparison of completion rates of the&#xD;
      different perfusion assessment methods; traditional, FA, Q-ICG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usability The usability of the quantitative perfusion assessment tool will be investigated&#xD;
      with a validated questionnaire, the System Usability Scale, answered by the surgeon&#xD;
      immediately after the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics Comparison of data will be performed using Mann Whitney U test or a paired sample&#xD;
      t-test depending on distribution normality. P-values &lt; 0.05 is considered significant. No&#xD;
      formal sample size calculation has been made, as the study is considered a feasibility trial.&#xD;
      20 patients will be recruited. Statistic evaluation was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics Â©&#xD;
      (v 22.0 SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse events, risks, and disadvantages Adverse events associated with the use of ICG are&#xD;
      extremely rare and severe anaphylactic reactions are almost never occurring. However, safety&#xD;
      precautions have been made by excluding patients with allergy to iodine, ICG or shellfish. In&#xD;
      addition, no patients with liver insufficiency, thyrotoxicosis, ongoing pregnancy, or&#xD;
      lactating women will be included.&#xD;
