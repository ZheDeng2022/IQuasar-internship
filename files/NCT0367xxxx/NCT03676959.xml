  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open-label, dose-escalation, and multidose study, aiming to investigate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics(PK) of ZKAB001 (a fully human monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody targeting the Programmed Death - Ligand 1 (PD-L1) membrane receptor on T lymphocytes&#xD;
      and other cells of the immune system) administered every 14 days in subjects with recurrent&#xD;
      or metastatic cervical cancer.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will consist of 4 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Lead-in period (Day -28),&#xD;
      Treatment (up to 24 cycles or 1 year, whichever occurs first), and Follow-up (up to 1 year).&#xD;
      There will be a lead-in period on Day -28 for each dose escalation cohort in which the&#xD;
      single-dose pharmacokinetics of ZKAB001 will be characterized prior to initiation of&#xD;
      continuous dosing in the first cycle of treatment. The lead-in period duration, PK&#xD;
      time-points, doses and/or regimens used in subsequent cohorts may be modified based on the&#xD;
      exposure (AUC) observed during the lead-in period (although the number of PK samples will not&#xD;
      be increased). Treatment of continuous dosing is up to 24 cycles or 1 year, until as per&#xD;
      investigator's opinion, subjects experience disease progression (evaluated by RECIST 1.1 and&#xD;
      immune-related response criteria irRECIST), no clinical benefit, or intolerable toxicity. If&#xD;
      investigators suspect subjects experience pseudoprogression or has evidence to prove &quot;mixed&#xD;
      response&quot;, subjects can continue to accept treatment as investigator decided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study was divided into two stages. After the recommended phase II dose (RP2D) is&#xD;
      determined in the first stage, the sample size will be amplified with RP2D in the second&#xD;
      stage. When a total of 15 cases are included in the two stages, an interim analysis will be&#xD;
      conducted to decide whether to expand the total number of cases to 60 based on the results of&#xD;
      the analysis. If more than 2 cases of response will be observed in 15 cervical cancer&#xD;
      subjects, 45 cases (with a total sample size of 60 cases) could be included to further&#xD;
      observe the safety and efficacy.&#xD;
