  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II, randomized, multicentre, multinational, open-label, cross-over study in&#xD;
      adult patients who have completed neoadjuvant chemotherapy with neoadjuvant pertuzumab and&#xD;
      trastuzumab and have undergone surgical treatment of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2&#xD;
      (HER2)-positive early breast cancer. The study will consist of two adjuvant treatment&#xD;
      periods: a treatment cross-over period and a treatment continuation period. It will evaluate&#xD;
      participant-reported preference for a subcutaneously administered fixed-dose combination&#xD;
      formulation (FDC SC) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab compared with intravenously (IV)&#xD;
      administered pertuzumab and trastuzumab formulations. The study will also evaluate&#xD;
      participant-reported satisfaction with pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life outcomes; healthcare professionals' perceptions of time/resource use and&#xD;
      convenience of pertuzumab and trastuzumab FDC SC compared with pertuzumab and trastuzumab IV&#xD;
      formulations; as well as the safety and efficacy of each study regimen.&#xD;

    <description>Heart failure is defined as a disorder characterized by the inability of the heart to pump blood at an adequate volume to meet tissue metabolic requirements, or, the ability to do only at an elevation in the filling pressure. Any adverse event of symptomatic left ventricular systolic dysfunction (LVSD; also referred to as heart failure) occurring during the study was to be reported as a serious adverse event.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline; Day 1 of Cycles 4, 7, and 11 (each cycle is 21 days); End of Treatment and Follow-Up visits (up to 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) is the measurement of how much blood is being pumped out of the left ventricle of the heart (the main pumping chamber) with each contraction. All participants who enrolled in this study must have had a baseline LVEF ≥55%. Verbatim description of adverse events was mapped to Medical Dictionary for Regulatory Activities (MedDRA) version 22.1. The MedDRA preferred term of 'ejection fraction decreased' is defined as an LVEF decrease of at least 10 percentage points from baseline and to below 50%.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Targeted Vital Signs Outside the Normal Limits During the Treatment Cross-Over Period Among Those Without an Abnormality at Baseline</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose at Day 1 of Cycles 1 (baseline), 4, and 7 (1 cycle is 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>The number of participants at any post-baseline timepoint with abnormal readings outside the normal range for vital signs of diastolic and systolic blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and body temperature were summarized according the specified direction of the abnormal reading (high or low). The number analyzed (denominator) in the results table represents participants without the specified abnormal vital sign at baseline. Not every vital sign abnormality qualified as an adverse event (AE). A vital sign result must have been reported as an AE if it met any of the following criteria: was accompanied by clinical symptoms; resulted in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation); resulted in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or, was clinically significant in the investigator's judgment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Chemistry and Hematology Laboratory Test Result Shifts From NCI-CTCAE Grade 0-2 at Baseline to Grade 3-4 Post-Baseline During the Treatment Cross-Over Period</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-dose at Day 1 of Cycles 1 (baseline), 4, and 7 (1 cycle is 21 days)</time_frame>
    <description>Laboratory data for targeted chemistry and hematology parameters were classified according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0; Grade 0 is normal and Grades 1 to 4 represent worsening levels of the parameter outside of the normal range in the specified direction of the abnormality (high and low are above and below the range, respectively). The results show the shifts in the number of participants with Grade 0-2 at baseline to Grade 3-4 post-baseline; those with missing baseline values were counted as Grade 0-2 at baseline. Not every laboratory abnormality qualified as an adverse event, only if it met any of the following criteria: was accompanied by clinical symptoms; resulted in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation); resulted in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or, was clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. SGOT/AST = aspartate aminotransferase; SGPT/ALT = alanine aminotransferase</description>

          <description>In the Treatment Cross-Over Period of the study, participants randomized to Arm A first received pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab IV (P+H IV) administration for 3 treatment cycles followed by the pertuzumab and trastuzumab fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous administration (PH FDC SC) for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days). Following completion of this study period, participants chose one of the two study treatments to receive in the Treatment Continuation Period for the remaining anti-HER2 treatment cycles (18 planned cycles in total, including pre-study neoadjuvant treatment). After completing study treatment, participants entered the Follow-up Period wherein they were to be followed for 3 years from the date the last participant was randomized.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants by Their Level of Satisfaction With the Respective Methods of Administration (IV and SC), Question 1 of the Therapy Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire -Intravenous (TASQ-IV) and -Subcutaneous (TASQ-SC)</title>
        <description>The Therapy Administration Satisfaction Questionnaire (TASQ) is a 12-item, patient-reported questionnaire measuring the impact of each mode of treatment administration (TASQ-IV for IV treatment and TASQ-SC for SC treatment) on five domains: Physical Impact, Psychological Impact, Impact on Activities of Daily Living, Convenience, and Satisfaction.

During the Treatment Cross-Over Period, all participants received their first 6 cycles of treatment in accordance with the study arm to which they were randomized: Arm A) pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab IV (P+H IV) for 3 treatment cycles followed by the pertuzumab and trastuzumab fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous administration (PH FDC SC) for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days); or Arm B) PH FDC SC for 3 treatment cycles followed by P+H IV for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days). Following completion of this study period, participants chose one of the two study treatments to receive in the Treatment Continuation Period for the remaining anti-HER2 treatment cycles (18 planned cycles in total, including pre-study neoadjuvant treatment). After completing study treatment, participants entered the Follow-up Period wherein they were to be followed for 3 years from the date the last participant was randomized.</description>

        <description>The TASQ is a 12-item, patient-reported questionnaire measuring the impact of the mode of treatment administration (TASQ-IV for IV treatment and TASQ-SC for SC treatment) on 5 domains: Physical Impact (3 items: Question [Q]2. Pain, Q3. Swelling, Q4. Redness), Psychological Impact (1 item: Q5. Feeling restricted), Impact on Activities of Daily Living (1 item: Q8. Lost/gained time), Convenience (2 items: Q6. Is it convenient?, Q7. Bothered by the amount of time?), and Satisfaction (2 items: Q1. How satisfied or dissatisfied are you with treatment?, Q12: Would you recommend the way you received the treatment?). In addition, 3 questions in the TASQ (Q9, Q10, Q11) are not part of the domains. Responses for the 3 domains that contain more than 1 item were scored from 0 to 100, with a higher score indicating a better outcome. Responses for the 2 domains with 1 item were scored from 1 to 5, with a higher score indicating a better outcome.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants by Their Responses to Question 9 of the TASQ-IV and TASQ-SC, Assessing Whether Participants Receiving IV and SC Administration Have as Much Time as They Would Like to Talk to Their Nurse and/or Doctor About Their Illness</title>
        <description>The TASQ is a 12-item, patient-reported questionnaire measuring the impact of the mode of treatment administration (TASQ-IV for IV treatment and TASQ-SC for SC treatment) on 5 domains. In addition, 3 questions (Q.9-11) are not part of the domains. The TASQ-IV/-SC was administered at treatment Cycles 3 and 6 according to the order of treatment received per arm during the Cross-Over Period. Question 9 asked the participant, &quot;When you receive the IV infusion/SC injection treatment, are you able to talk to your nurse and/or doctor as much as you would like about your illness?&quot; There were five available response options: a) Yes, I had more than enough time to talk to my nurse and/or doctor; b) Yes, but I would have liked more time to talk to my nurse and/or doctor; c) It does not matter to me if I have time to talk to my nurse and/or doctor during my treatment; d) No, I did not have enough time to talk to my nurse and/or doctor; and e) No, I did not talk to my nurse and/or doctor at all.</description>

During the Treatment Cross-Over Period, all participants received their first 6 cycles of treatment in accordance with the study arm to which they were randomized: Arm A) pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab IV (P+H IV) for 3 treatment cycles followed by the pertuzumab and trastuzumab fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous administration (PH FDC SC) for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days); or Arm B) PH FDC SC for 3 treatment cycles followed by P+H IV for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days). Following completion of this study period, participants chose one of the two study treatments to receive in the Treatment Continuation Period for the remaining anti-HER2 treatment cycles (18 planned cycles in total, including pre-study neoadjuvant treatment). After completing study treatment, participants entered the Follow-up Period wherein they were to be followed for 3 years from the date the last participant was randomized.</description>

          <title>Percentage of Participants by Their Responses to Question 9 of the TASQ-IV and TASQ-SC, Assessing Whether Participants Receiving IV and SC Administration Have as Much Time as They Would Like to Talk to Their Nurse and/or Doctor About Their Illness</title>
          <description>The TASQ is a 12-item, patient-reported questionnaire measuring the impact of the mode of treatment administration (TASQ-IV for IV treatment and TASQ-SC for SC treatment) on 5 domains. In addition, 3 questions (Q.9-11) are not part of the domains. The TASQ-IV/-SC was administered at treatment Cycles 3 and 6 according to the order of treatment received per arm during the Cross-Over Period. Question 9 asked the participant, &quot;When you receive the IV infusion/SC injection treatment, are you able to talk to your nurse and/or doctor as much as you would like about your illness?&quot; There were five available response options: a) Yes, I had more than enough time to talk to my nurse and/or doctor; b) Yes, but I would have liked more time to talk to my nurse and/or doctor; c) It does not matter to me if I have time to talk to my nurse and/or doctor during my treatment; d) No, I did not have enough time to talk to my nurse and/or doctor; and e) No, I did not talk to my nurse and/or doctor at all.</description>

        <description>At treatment Cycle 7, participants were expected to select the study treatment formulation (PH FDC SC or P+H IV) to complete their 18 cycles of neo/adjuvant HER2-targeted treatment after completion of the Treatment Cross-over Period. Additionally, for each participant's preference category (SC, IV, and No preference) as per the question 1 of the patient preference questionnaire (PPQ), the percentage of participants who selected each treatment administration route for the Treatment Continuation Period (PH FDC SC or P+H IV) was summarized.</description>

            <description>This analysis set includes all healthcare professionals who treated participants from Arms A and B and completed the HCPQ questionnaire, which was administered at the last treatment cycle in the Treatment Cross-Over Period of the study. During the Treatment Cross-Over Period of the study, all participants received their first 6 cycles of treatment in accordance with the study arm to which they were randomized: Arm A) pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab IV (P+H IV) for 3 treatment cycles followed by the pertuzumab and trastuzumab fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous administration (PH FDC SC) for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days); or Arm B) PH FDC SC for 3 treatment cycles followed by P+H IV for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days). Following completion of this study period, participants chose one of the two study treatments to receive in the Treatment Continuation Period for the remaining anti-HER2 treatment cycles (18 planned cycles in total, including pre-study neoadjuvant treatment). After completing study treatment, participants entered the Follow-up Period wherein they were to be followed for 3 years from the date the last participant was randomized.</description>

During the Treatment Cross-Over Period of the study, all participants received their first 6 cycles of treatment in accordance with the study arm to which they were randomized: Arm A) pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab IV (P+H IV) for 3 treatment cycles followed by the pertuzumab and trastuzumab fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous administration (PH FDC SC) for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days); or Arm B) PH FDC SC for 3 treatment cycles followed by P+H IV for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days). Following completion of this study period, participants chose one of the two study treatments to receive in the Treatment Continuation Period for the remaining anti-HER2 treatment cycles (18 planned cycles in total, including pre-study neoadjuvant treatment). After completing study treatment, participants entered the Follow-up Period wherein they were to be followed for 3 years from the date the last participant was randomized.</description>

            <description>This analysis set includes all healthcare professionals who treated participants from Arms A and B and completed the HCPQ questionnaire, which was administered at the last treatment cycle in the Treatment Cross-Over Period of the study. During the Treatment Cross-Over Period of the study, all participants received their first 6 cycles of treatment in accordance with the study arm to which they were randomized: Arm A) pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab IV (P+H IV) for 3 treatment cycles followed by the pertuzumab and trastuzumab fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous administration (PH FDC SC) for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days); or Arm B) PH FDC SC for 3 treatment cycles followed by P+H IV for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days). Following completion of this study period, participants chose one of the two study treatments to receive in the Treatment Continuation Period for the remaining anti-HER2 treatment cycles (18 planned cycles in total, including pre-study neoadjuvant treatment). After completing study treatment, participants entered the Follow-up Period wherein they were to be followed for 3 years from the date the last participant was randomized.</description>

            <description>This analysis set includes all healthcare professionals who treated participants from Arms A and B and completed the HCPQ questionnaire, which was administered at the last treatment cycle in the Treatment Cross-Over Period of the study. During the Treatment Cross-Over Period of the study, all participants received their first 6 cycles of treatment in accordance with the study arm to which they were randomized: Arm A) pertuzumab IV and trastuzumab IV (P+H IV) for 3 treatment cycles followed by the pertuzumab and trastuzumab fixed-dose combination for subcutaneous administration (PH FDC SC) for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days); or Arm B) PH FDC SC for 3 treatment cycles followed by P+H IV for 3 treatment cycles (1 cycle = 21 days). Following completion of this study period, participants chose one of the two study treatments to receive in the Treatment Continuation Period for the remaining anti-HER2 treatment cycles (18 planned cycles in total, including pre-study neoadjuvant treatment). After completing study treatment, participants entered the Follow-up Period wherein they were to be followed for 3 years from the date the last participant was randomized.</description>

        <title>Safety Summary for Assessment of Switching Between the FDC SC and IV Formulations: Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event During the Treatment Cross-Over Period by Study Arm and Treatment Received</title>
        <description>Investigators used the NCI CTCAE v4.0 grading scale for assessing adverse event (AE) severity; if not listed, AE severity was graded as follows: Grade 1 = mild; Grade 2 = moderate; Grade 3 = severe or medically significant; Grade 4 = life-threatening; Grade 5 = death related to AE. Severity and seriousness are not synonymous and investigators independently assessed these criteria for each AE. Investigators also determined whether an AE was considered to be related to the study drug. Adverse events to monitor were defined based on known risks associated with the study drugs and included: hypersensitivity reactions, administration-related reactions (ARRs), cardiac dysfunction, diarrhea grade ≥3, rash/skin reactions, mucositis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), (febrile) neutropenia, pulmonary events that may occur as a result of an ARR, and pregnancy/neonatal related. Multiple occurrences of AEs were counted only once per participant. LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction</description>

        <title>Safety Summary of the FDC SC and IV Formulations: Number of Participants With at Least One Adverse Event During the Treatment Cross-Over and Treatment Continuation Periods</title>
        <description>Investigators used the NCI CTCAE v4.0 grading scale for assessing adverse event (AE) severity; if not listed, AE severity was graded as follows: Grade 1 = mild; Grade 2 = moderate; Grade 3 = severe or medically significant; Grade 4 = life-threatening; Grade 5 = death related to AE. Severity and seriousness are not synonymous and investigators independently assessed these criteria for each AE. Investigators also determined whether an AE was considered to be related to the study drug. Adverse events to monitor were defined based on known risks associated with the study drugs and included: hypersensitivity reactions, administration-related reactions (ARRs), cardiac dysfunction, diarrhea grade ≥3, rash/skin reactions, mucositis, interstitial lung disease (ILD), (febrile) neutropenia, pulmonary events that may occur as a result of an ARR, and pregnancy/neonatal related. Multiple occurrences of AEs were counted only once per participant. LVEF = left ventricular ejection fraction</description>

        <title>Number of Participants With Chemistry and Hematology Laboratory Test Result Shifts From NCI-CTCAE Grade 0-2 at Baseline to Grade 3-4 Post-Baseline During the Treatment Cross-Over Period</title>
        <description>Laboratory data for targeted chemistry and hematology parameters were classified according to the NCI CTCAE v4.0; Grade 0 is normal and Grades 1 to 4 represent worsening levels of the parameter outside of the normal range in the specified direction of the abnormality (high and low are above and below the range, respectively). The results show the shifts in the number of participants with Grade 0-2 at baseline to Grade 3-4 post-baseline; those with missing baseline values were counted as Grade 0-2 at baseline. Not every laboratory abnormality qualified as an adverse event, only if it met any of the following criteria: was accompanied by clinical symptoms; resulted in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation); resulted in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or, was clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. SGOT/AST = aspartate aminotransferase; SGPT/ALT = alanine aminotransferase</description>

        <population>Safety Population: All participants who received at least one dose of any study treatment categorized according to the study treatment administered. In this analysis, participants are grouped by study arm and treatment received during the Cross-Over Period.

The results show the shifts in the number of participants with Grade 0-2 at baseline to Grade 3-4 post-baseline; those with missing baseline values were counted as Grade 0-2 at baseline. Not every laboratory abnormality qualified as an adverse event, only if it met any of the following criteria: was accompanied by clinical symptoms; resulted in a change in study treatment (e.g., dosage modification, treatment interruption, or treatment discontinuation); resulted in a medical intervention or a change in concomitant therapy; or, was clinically significant in the investigator's judgment. SGOT/AST = aspartate aminotransferase; SGPT/ALT = alanine aminotransferase</description>
          <population>Safety Population: All participants who received at least one dose of any study treatment categorized according to the study treatment administered. In this analysis, participants are grouped by study arm and treatment received during the Cross-Over Period. The number analyzed (denominator) represents those with NCI-CTCAE Grade 0-2 at baseline and at least one post-baseline assessment.</population>
