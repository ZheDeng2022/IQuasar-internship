  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy is still the standard first-line treatment option for EGFR unmutated patients.&#xD;
      After a randomized phase Ⅲ trial, BEYOND was presented the synergistic effect of&#xD;
      progression-free survival(PFS) could be expected when chemotherapy is combined with&#xD;
      Antiangiogenesis agent bevacizumab in China;Therefore,in this study, The investigators will&#xD;
      investigate the efficacy and safety of Anlotinb combined With Pemetrexed and Cisplatin as&#xD;
      first-line therapy in patients with chemotherapy-naive, stage IIIB or IV, non-squamous NSCLC&#xD;
      without targetable EGFR or ALK genetic aberrations.&#xD;

      This is a randomized, single -center study conducted in China to compare the efficacy and&#xD;
      safety of Anlotinb combined With Pemetrexed and Cisplatin as first-line therapy in patients&#xD;
      of Advanced Gene Negative Non-squamous Non-small Cell Lung Cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will be randomized to arm A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were instructed to take 500mg/m2 pemetrexed as a 10-minute intravenous infusion and&#xD;
      Cisplatin 75mg/m2 on day 1 of a 21-day cycle and12mg Anlotinib orally daily on day 1 to 14 of&#xD;
      a 21-day cycle.If there was no evidence of disease progression following a maximum of 4-6&#xD;
      cycles of anlotinib plus chemotherapy, patients continued to receive single-agent anlotinib&#xD;
      until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Approximately 62 patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled to ensure complete treatments for primary endpoint analysis.&#xD;
