    <textblock>
      Emerging evidence suggests that the timing of creatine supplementation may be an important&#xD;
      regulator of muscle growth and strength. It is unclear whether creatine ingested before or&#xD;
      after resistance training is more beneficial. A limitation of previous research is the use of&#xD;
      a between subject design. A between subject design is associated with several potential&#xD;
      confounders (habitual diet, genetics, activities of daily living, etc.) that may have masked&#xD;
      the true effect. The purpose of this study is to examine the effect of creatine timing&#xD;
      (creatine before vs. creatine after) using a randomized, double blind, repeated measures,&#xD;
      within-subject design. Participants will resistance train their left arm and left leg one day&#xD;
      and their right arm and right leg the next day. Participants will supplement with creatine&#xD;
      BEFORE one of the training days (randomized to either left or right side) and on the opposite&#xD;
      training day (opposite side of the body to the previous training day) supplement with&#xD;
      creatine AFTER training. Having the same person in both conditions will control for genetics,&#xD;
      habitual diet, other daily activities, and so on, that may have confounded previous research.&#xD;
      Muscle mass and strength changes will be measured in each limb prior to and following 8 weeks&#xD;
      of training to determine whether creatine timing influenced muscle growth.&#xD;

      training day (opposite side of the body to the previous training day) supplement with&#xD;
      creatine AFTER training. Having the same person in both conditions will control for genetics,&#xD;
      habitual diet, other daily activities, and so on, that may have confounded previous research.&#xD;
      Muscle mass and strength changes will be measured in each limb prior to and following 8 weeks&#xD;
      of training to determine whether creatine timing influenced muscle growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 - A 3-day dietary record (to determine typical energy intake and macronutrient&#xD;
      breakdown for participant characteristics), anthropometric testing (height and weight), age,&#xD;
      muscle thickness (via ultrasound for elbow flexors and leg extensors), and bicep curl and leg&#xD;
      extension 1-repetition maximal strength will be determined. In addition, strength training&#xD;
      experience and hand dominance will be determined via standardized questionnaires. Muscle&#xD;
      thickness of the elbow flexors and leg extensors will be measured before and after the 8&#xD;
      weeks training period using B-mode ultrasound (LOGIQ e BTO8, GE Healthcare, Milwaukee,&#xD;
      Wisconsin, USA). Bicep curl and leg extension maximal strength will be assessed on each limb&#xD;
      using a 1-repetition maximum (1-RM) standard testing procedure. Briefly, following 5 minutes&#xD;
      of cycling on a stationary cycle ergometer, participants will perform 2 warm-up sets (to&#xD;
      reduce the risk of injury) in the following order: 1 set of 10 repetitions using a weight&#xD;
      determined by each subject to be comfortable and 1 set of 5 repetitions using increased&#xD;
      weight. Two minutes after the warm-up sets, weight will be progressively increased for each&#xD;
      subsequent 1-repetition maximum attempt with a 2-min rest interval. The 1-rep max will be&#xD;
      reached in 4-6 sets, excluding the 2 warm-up sets. All exercise testing will be superivsed by&#xD;
      a a trained research assistant or by a Canadian Society for Exericse Physiology certified&#xD;
      exercise physiologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Next 8 Weeks (Resistance Training Program):&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Resistance Training will include 3 to 6 sets (progressing overtime; starting at 3 sets&#xD;
      and increasing 1 set per week until a maximum of 6 sets) of 80% of 1 repetition maximum with&#xD;
      a 3 second eccentric phase (i.e., 1-2 seconds up and 3 seconds down) until failure (unable to&#xD;
      complete another repetition or form failure). Each participant will complete 3 training&#xD;
      sessions per week per side (total of 6 sessions per week). Prior to each training session,&#xD;
      but after the supplement had been consumed, each participant will perform a 5-min stationary&#xD;
      cycling warm-up at a self-selected intensity. Resistance exercises will include bicep curls&#xD;
      and leg extensions. These two exercises were selected because they are safe and easy to learn&#xD;
      and include large upper body and lower body musculature that are known to respond to&#xD;
      resistance training. Participants will maintain daily training logs that include the weight,&#xD;
      number of sets, and number of repetitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplementation Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will supplement with creatine on one of the training days (either when they are&#xD;
      training their left or right side) BEFORE training in a dose previous shown to enhance&#xD;
      training adaptations (0.1 grams of creatine per kilogram of body weight before training and a&#xD;
      placebo - cornstarch maltodextrin after training). When the participants trains their&#xD;
      opposite side of the body they will supplement with creatine AFTER training (0.1 grams per&#xD;
      kilogram of placebo before and 0.1 grams per kilogram of creatine after). The placebo will be&#xD;
      identical in color, texture, tast, and appearance. The purpose of the placebo is so the&#xD;
      participants will not know which day they are receiving creatine before training and which&#xD;
      day they are receiving creatine after training. The creatine is research grade and has been&#xD;
      independtly tested and will be provided free of charge. Any adverse events related to the&#xD;
      exercise or the supplement will be recorded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post Testing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 8 weeks of training. Participants will complete the baseline testing (Day 1)&#xD;
      protocols to determine strength and muscle thickness changes in each limb.&#xD;
