      This is a single-center, exploratory, Phase 1 Positron Emission Tomography/x-ray Computed&#xD;
      Tomography (PET/CT) imaging study to detect amyloidosis that will enroll patients with a&#xD;
      confirmed diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis. The purpose of this exploratory trial is to&#xD;
      assess the safety and efficacy of 124I-p5+14 Injection at a single-injection dose adequate&#xD;
      for imaging amyloid deposits by using PET/CT imaging in subjects with confirmed systemic&#xD;
      Immunoglobulin Light Chain-associated Amyloidosis (AL), Transthyretin-associated Amyloidosis&#xD;
      (ATTR), Leukocyte Chemotactic Factor 2-associated Amyloidosis (ALect2) as well as other&#xD;
      types.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale for this study is the discovery of a synthetic polypeptide, designated p5+14, a&#xD;
      synthetic 45 amino acid peptide that binds many forms of amyloid, including human AL-, ATTR-&#xD;
      and ALect2-associated amyloid, as well as human and murine serum amyloid protein A-associated&#xD;
      (AA) amyloid. In preclinical studies, using SPECT and PET imaging, as well as&#xD;
      microautoradiography, it has been shown that radioiodinated p5+14 binds rapidly and&#xD;
      specifically to all amyloid deposits in abdominothoracic organs and tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a single site, exploratory, open-label Phase I PET/CT imaging and dosimetry study.&#xD;
      The investigational drug product (designated 124I-p5+14 Injection) is an amyloid-reactive&#xD;
      synthetic peptide, p5+14 (also known as APi1832), radiolabeled with iodine-124 (I-124 or&#xD;
      124I). All patients enrolled in this exploratory trial will be outpatients with a confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of systemic amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first three patients enrolled in the trial (Part 1) will take part in a dose-escalation&#xD;
      dosimetry study and will receive a single intravenous (IV) dose of 11.1 Megabecquerel (MBq)&#xD;
      (0.3 millicuries (mCi); n = 1), 37 MBq (1 mCi; n = 1) or 74 MBq (2 mCi; n = 1) of 124I-p5+14&#xD;
      Injection for the purpose of determining estimates of organ-associated and whole body&#xD;
      radioactive dosimetry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial then will be opened to include another 54 patients who will receive a single IV&#xD;
      bolus injection of 2 mCi 124I-p5+14 Injection. Every patient participating will receive &lt; 2&#xD;
      mg of peptide p5+14. The study comprises five parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 2, the trial will enroll SA patients with confirmed AL, ATTR, ALECT2, or other forms&#xD;
      of amyloidosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 3, the trial will study asymptomatic subjects with genetically confirmed mutation of&#xD;
      the transthyretin gene.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4 will include five healthy control subjects. Part 5 will recruit previously enrolled&#xD;
      subjects from Parts 2 or 3 who received a 2 mC dose of 124I-p5+14 Injection and had images&#xD;
      confirming the presence of abnormal amyloid deposits for a second exposure to 124I p5+14&#xD;
      Injection and second PET/CT scan.&#xD;
