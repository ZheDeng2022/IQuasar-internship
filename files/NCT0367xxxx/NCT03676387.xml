      Background: Ultrasound (US) imaging technique has recently emerged as a novel, simple,&#xD;
      portable, noninvasive tool helpful for airway assessment and management. Initial few&#xD;
      published reports were on soft tissue imaging of neck, focusing on pre-tracheal structure and&#xD;
      anterior tracheal wall. In our study, we compared the measurement of subglottic diameter&#xD;
      using ultrasonography and the aged based formula in prediction of endotracheal tube size in&#xD;
      children underwent elective surgical operation under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Patients were randomly divided in 2 groups (27 patients each) using a&#xD;
      computer-generated randomization schedule. The first group was aged based group (group AB) (n&#xD;
      = 27): the endotracheal tube size was determined according to age of the child [inner&#xD;
      diameter [ID] in mm = (age in yr/4) +4. The second group was ultrasound based group (group&#xD;
      UB) (n = 27): the endotracheal tube size was determined according to the subglottic&#xD;
      transverse diameter that was estimated with ultrasonography (the outer diameter of&#xD;
      endotracheal tube (ETT OD) = 0.55*(subglottic diameter)+1.16) .&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric tracheal intubation requires considerable expertise and can represent a challenge&#xD;
      to many anesthesiologists(Marciniak et al.,2009). Anatomically; the larynx of a pediatric&#xD;
      patient assumes a funnel shape with its narrowest part at the level of the cricoid ring,&#xD;
      which cannot be seen during conventional laryngoscopy (Karsli et al.,2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Choosing the correct endotracheal tube (ETT) size needed for intubation of pediatric patients&#xD;
      is important because an inappropriately too large tracheal tube can cause upper airway damage&#xD;
      (e.g., local ischemia, ulceration, scar formation) and the potential for subsequent&#xD;
      subglottic stenosis. In contrast, an ETT that is too small may result in insufficient&#xD;
      ventilation, poor reliability of end-tidal gas monitoring, leakage of anesthetic gases into&#xD;
      the operating room environment, and an enhanced risk of aspiration(Karsli et al.,2002).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different algorithms and formula have been proposed to choose the best-fitting size of the&#xD;
      endotracheal tube. Age-based formulas, such as those of Cole and Motoyama, have been used to&#xD;
      estimate optimal ETT size for more than half a century (Motoyama,1990) and this formula is&#xD;
      [inner diameter (ID) in mm = (age in yr/4) +4]. Predictive formulas for appropriate ETT size&#xD;
      have also been based on patient weight and height as[ID in mm = 2 + height in cm/30] and [ID&#xD;
      in mm = 2.44 + age in yr ×0.1 + height in cm ×0.02 + weight in kg ×0.016] and other formula&#xD;
      as the width of the 5th fingernail is used for ID prediction of the ETT [ID in mm = maximum&#xD;
      width of the 5th fingernail] (Shibasaki et al.,2010). However, these methods are not always&#xD;
      suitable because the size of the airway varies considerably between patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound guided is helpful for evaluate the subglottic transverse diameter which is safe ,&#xD;
      sample, painless and non invasive modality for prediction of proper endotracheal tube size&#xD;
      (Jagadish G Sutagatti et al., 2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we compared the measurement of subglottic diameter using ultrasonography and&#xD;
      the aged based formula in prediction of endotracheal tube size in children underwent elective&#xD;
      surgical operation under general anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and participants After getting approval from the institutional research&#xD;
      board(MS/16.01.143), faculty of medicine , Mansoura University, written informed consents&#xD;
      were obtained from parents of fifty children aged from 1 to 6 years of either sex scheduled&#xD;
      for elective surgery not exceeded 90 minutes underwent general anesthesia with uncuffed&#xD;
      endotracheal tube. This randomized controlled study was conducted in Emergency Hospital,&#xD;
      Mansoura University between April/2016 to April/2017 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient exclusion criteria include: an anticipated difficult airway, any respiratory disease&#xD;
      that might cause airway narrowing, pre-exiting laryngeal or tracheal pathology, any lesion&#xD;
      that could cause airway deformity due to fibrosis or the presence of a neck anatomical&#xD;
      pathologies that might have unpredictable effect on the ultrasound assessment of the airway&#xD;
      and prolonged surgery more than 90 minutes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appropriateness of ETT size was adopted as a primary parameter for effective size used&#xD;
      for sample size calculation. A power of 80% was accepted with alpha error of 0.05. fifty four&#xD;
      patients in both groups were found to be enough to detect a 20% difference between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly divided in 2 groups (27 patients each) using a computer-generated&#xD;
      randomization schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aged based group (group AB) (n = 27): ETT size was determined according to age of the child,&#xD;
      inner diameter [ID] in mm = (age in yr/4) +4(Van den Berg and Mphanza, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound based group (group UB) (n = 27): ETT was determined according to the subglottic&#xD;
      transverse diameter that was estimated with ultrasonography.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      On arrival to the operating room, basic monitors were applied {ECG, pulse oximetry,&#xD;
      non-invasive blood pressure (NIBP)}, baseline values were recorded and An intravenous cannula&#xD;
      (24G) was inserted and secured . General anesthesia was induced by inhalation of sevoflurane.&#xD;
      Muscular relaxation was achieved with atracurium (0.5mg/kg) to facilitate the endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation under direct laryngoscopy. The patients were ventilated with sevoflurane in 100%&#xD;
      oxygen via a facemask before intubation for 3 min for proper muscles relaxation. ETT was&#xD;
      chosen according to each group. Aged based formula (inner diameter [ID] in mm = (age in yr/4)&#xD;
      +4) was used in group AB and in group UB, during mask ventilation ultrasound guided&#xD;
      subglottic transverse diameter was measured with assistant anesthesiologist help. To avoid&#xD;
      observer bias by anesthesiologist who performs the leak test by the absence of ultrasound&#xD;
      machine in the operating room, the ultrasound assessment also was done in group&#xD;
      AB(aged-based).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasonography technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subglottic diameter was estimated with B-mode ultrasonography (Korean, Siemens, Acuson,&#xD;
      x300) with a 10-13-MHz linear probe positioned on the midline of the anterior neck (figure1).&#xD;
      The evaluation began by identifying the true vocal folds as paired hyperechoic linear&#xD;
      structures that moved with respiration and swallowing before patients were paralyzed. The&#xD;
      probe was then moved caudally to visualize the cricoid arch which appears as an arched,&#xD;
      rounded and hypoechoic structure (figure2). The transverse air-column diameter was measured&#xD;
      at the lower edge of the cricoid cartilage after patients were paralyzed (figure3).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The measurements of the subglottic diameter was used to select the outer diameter of&#xD;
      endotracheal tube by the equation [ETT OD=0.55*(subglottic diameter)+1.16] (Shibasaki et al.,&#xD;
      2010), since the outer diameter of endotracheal tube differs among different manufactures, we&#xD;
      used uncuffed Mallinckrodt tracheal tube with a Murphy's eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inner diameter of endotracheal tube that was calculated according to table (1) which show&#xD;
      the correlation between outer and inner diameter of the endotracheal tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of appropriateness of ETT size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another anesthesiologist who was blinded to the group allocation did the air leak test in all&#xD;
      patients. The air leak test was done after successful intubation of ETT chosen on the basis&#xD;
      of either of two methods, The correct tracheal tube size was considered optimal when an&#xD;
      audible air leak around the tube at an inspiratory airway pressure was detected between 10-30&#xD;
      cm H2O, with the head and neck in a neutral position. The presence of an air leak was&#xD;
      assessed by closing off the pop-off valve and allowing pressure to rise slowly until an&#xD;
      audible leak was heard using a stethoscope on the tube. If there was no audible leak when the&#xD;
      lung were inflated to a pressure of 30 cm H2O, the tube was exchanged with one that was 0.5&#xD;
      mm smaller. But if a leak occurred at an inflation pressure of less than 10 cm of H2O, the&#xD;
      ETT was exchanged for one with the 0.5 mm larger tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following parameters were monitored:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary outcome: Number of optimum tube selection was monitored in both group (group AB&#xD;
           and group UB).2- Number of reintubation due to large or small tube.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary outcome: 1- Time of intubation. 2- Complication after extubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS for windows version 20.0 (SPSS, Chicago,&#xD;
      IL). Continuous data we re-expressed in mean ±standard deviation (SD) white categorical data&#xD;
      were expressed in number and percentage. The differences between two groups were determined&#xD;
      using Student's t test for variables with continuous data and chi-square test for variables&#xD;
      with categorical data. The 95% confidence interval (CI) for the frequency of correct size of&#xD;
      the endotracheal tube (ETT) was calculated. Statistical significance was set at p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
