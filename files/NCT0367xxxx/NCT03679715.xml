  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the study is to examine the effects of the Montreal Museum of Fine&#xD;
      Arts (MMFA) participatory art-based activity on wellbeing, quality of life and health&#xD;
      condition in older community dwellers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aging is often associated with worsening health and withdrawal from social activities, both&#xD;
      increasing the risk of a poor quality of life. It has been reported that the practice of art,&#xD;
      especially participatory art-based activity enhances wellbeing, quality of life and health&#xD;
      condition of patients and older adults. Since October 2015, the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts&#xD;
      (MMFA; Quebec, Canada) has successfully initiated a participatory art-based activity known as&#xD;
      &quot;Les Beaux-Jeudis&quot; for older community dwellers living in Montreal. Recently, the&#xD;
      investigator demonstrated that the MMFA participatory art-based activity improved wellbeing,&#xD;
      quality of life and health condition of Montreal older community dwellers using a pre-post&#xD;
      single arm, prospective and longitudinal design: it was not a randomized controlled trial&#xD;
      (RCT) which is the gold standard to examine the effects of an intervention.&#xD;

      Background. Recently, the investigator demonstrated that the Montreal Museum of Fine-Arts&#xD;
      (MMFA) participatory art-based activity improved wellbeing, quality of life and health&#xD;
      condition of Montreal older community dwellers using a pre-post single arm, prospective and&#xD;
      longitudinal design. The main limitation of this pilot study was its design: it was not a&#xD;
      randomized controlled trial (RCT) which is the gold standard to examine the effects of an&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives. The overall objective is to examine the effect of the MMFA participatory&#xD;
      art-based activity on wellbeing, quality of life and health condition in older community&#xD;
      dwellers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific objectives are to compare the changes in 1) wellbeing, 2) quality of life and 3)&#xD;
      health condition in older community dwellers participating in the museum participatory&#xD;
      art-based activity (Intervention group) and in age and sex-matched older community dwellers&#xD;
      who are not participants in the museum participatory art-based activity (Control group)&#xD;
      during the same period of time. In addition, the compliance to museum participatory art-based&#xD;
      activity in intervention will be examined. A second study, based on the same process, has&#xD;
      been proceeded in Japan (Tokyo). With merging the 2 databases, we will study the impact of&#xD;
      cultural specificities, comparing data collected in Montreal and data collected in Tokyo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods. The design is a unicentre (Jewish General Hospital; Montreal, Quebec, Canada),&#xD;
      clinical, randomized, controlled, single blinded (i.e.; investigators), superiority trial,&#xD;
      with two parallel arms (Intervention and Control groups), comparative (comparison of&#xD;
      Intervention and Control groups) and analyzed with the intention-to-treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants in the Intervention group will be participants of the museum participatory&#xD;
      art-based activity. The Control group will be composed of older community dwellers matched on&#xD;
      age and sex compared to the Intervention group but who will not be participate to the museum&#xD;
      participatory art-based activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow-up period will be 3 months, which is the duration of a session of the museum&#xD;
      participatory art-based activity. Assessment of wellbeing, quality of life and health&#xD;
      condition will be performed at baseline, at the beginning of second and third months, and at&#xD;
      the end of third month.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The same study has been developed and realized in Japan. Data collected in Canada will be&#xD;
      merged with data collected in Japan and the analysis will be repeated for this international&#xD;
      database.&#xD;
