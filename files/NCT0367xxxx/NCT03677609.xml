  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mindsets play an important role in motivating and shaping health behavior and outcomes. For&#xD;
      example, when patients have the mindset that a treatment will work, they are more likely to&#xD;
      adhere to treatment medications and the treatment itself becomes more effective as a result&#xD;
      of this mindset. Providers have an opportunity to shape important patient mindsets as part of&#xD;
      clinical care, and these mindsets may influence patients' adherence to medication, screening&#xD;
      and vaccination recommendations, and diet, exercise, and treatment recommendations that can&#xD;
      help patients manage chronic illness. To help care teams capitalize on the potential of&#xD;
      leveraging mindsets in medicine and improve patient health behavior and outcomes, we&#xD;
      developed and implemented the Medicine Plus Mindset Training as part of Primary Care 2.0.&#xD;
      Built on more than two decades of research, this training program (a) Informs Primary Care&#xD;
      teams about the power of patient mindsets in shaping treatment outcomes (b) Provides care&#xD;
      teams with a language and framework to identify which patient mindsets may be at play (i.e.&#xD;
      patient mindsets about illness, treatment, their body, and the provider/care team) and (c)&#xD;
      Equips care teams with skills and techniques to effectively shape patient mindsets to improve&#xD;
      health outcomes. By motivating care teams to recognize patient mindsets that may be hindering&#xD;
      health behavior change (such as &quot;this illness is a catastrophe&quot;) or medication adherence&#xD;
      (such as &quot;this medication is going to cause side effects&quot;), care teams become better equipped&#xD;
      to help their patients adopt more useful mindsets (such as &quot;this treatment will work,&quot; &quot;this&#xD;
      illness is manageable,&quot; &quot;my body is capable,&quot; and &quot;I am in good hands&quot;).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Healthcare providers at four Stanford clinic sites will be the investigators' main&#xD;
      participants and the study will follow a wait-list control design. The investigators will&#xD;
      track patient health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention described in this study will only be for the healthcare team. The&#xD;
      investigators will track both provider outcomes (using self-report survey measures) and&#xD;
      patient outcomes (using health information already being collected by the clinic). Although&#xD;
      the investigators will be tracking the outcomes of all physicians at the clinics, only select&#xD;
      patient outcomes will be included as part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will begin with the care team filling out baseline self-report surveys online&#xD;
      and/or in person.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to delivering the intervention, the clinics will be split, and half of the clinic sites&#xD;
      will be assigned to be wait-list control clinics, while the other half of sites will receive&#xD;
      the mindset training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention for the care team will be delivered in person by members of the research&#xD;
      team. The care team will be told that the investigators are assessing the impact of a novel&#xD;
      training program for providers.The care team will truthfully be informed that the training&#xD;
      they are receiving is designed to enhance their interactions with patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The care team: Physicians will be asked to fill out an initial brief survey about their&#xD;
      mindsets about connecting with patients, burnout, job satisfaction, and their efficacy using&#xD;
      harnessing mindsets in clinical practice. Care team members will then be asked to fill out&#xD;
      the same survey after receiving their training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Charts will be reviewed to assess patient health outcomes. Data from the electronic medical&#xD;
      record will be used to assess patient health outcomes at all clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overview of Expected Outcomes: This training was designed to improve care teams' ability to&#xD;
      shape patient mindsets in clinical care, and therefore influence patient outcomes in the&#xD;
      following ways:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase adherence to medication, screening, and vaccination recommendations. When care&#xD;
           teams are better able to instill the mindset that treatment is likely to be beneficial&#xD;
           and not harmful, patients will be more motivated to adhere to treatment recommendations.&#xD;
           When care teams are better able to instill the mindset that patients are in good hands&#xD;
           (e.g. the provider/care team is both warm/&quot;gets them&quot; and competent/&quot;gets it&quot;), patients&#xD;
           will trust recommendations more and be more likely to follow through with them.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduce unnecessary antibiotic use. When care teams are better able to instill the&#xD;
           mindsets that an illness is manageable and the patient's body is capable, patients will&#xD;
           be more likely to believe care teams when they say antibiotics are unnecessary (e.g. in&#xD;
           the case of colds or certain respiratory illnesses), thereby reducing overall antibiotic&#xD;
           usage.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improve health outcomes for patients with chronic illness. When care teams are better&#xD;
           able to instill the mindsets that chronic illness is manageable, that patients' bodies&#xD;
           are capable, that treatment is likely to be effective, and that they are in good hands,&#xD;
           patients will be more likely to manage their chronic illness through both medication and&#xD;
           lifestyle change, which will lead to improved health outcomes for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Computation Plans for Requested Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the impact of the training, we will review patient-level primary care data from&#xD;
      January 1, 2016-June 1, 2020. Using the data requested, we will compute outcomes for each of&#xD;
      the three broad categories as follows. We will compare outcomes within each clinic before and&#xD;
      after the training was implemented, and will also compare outcomes at the two initial&#xD;
      intervention clinics to outcomes at the two initial-wait list clinics during the time period&#xD;
      in which two of the clinics had received the training and two had not.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase Adherence&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prescription fills, refills, &amp; discontinuations Refill requests will serve as a proxy&#xD;
           measure for whether patients are taking their medications as prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Medications of interest:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prescriptions fills, refills, &amp; discontinuations for medications for chronic disease&#xD;
           management medications such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
           o Antidepressants&#xD;
&#xD;
           • SSRIs &amp; SNIs&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Statins&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Hypertension medication&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Beta blockers&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Ace inhibitors&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Calcium Channel Blockers&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Thiazide diuretics&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  All common blood pressure medications&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Diabetic medications&#xD;
&#xD;
                • Variable(s) we will compute:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will compute the percentage of patients who re-fill new prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Denominator: Patients who have received a new prescription for one of the&#xD;
                     medications listed above. New prescriptions will be defined as any&#xD;
                     prescription not previously given in the past year (we will exclude patients&#xD;
                     for whom this is their first visit to this provider). Patients who are&#xD;
                     receiving a different prescription for the same condition will count as new&#xD;
                     prescriptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Numerator: Patients from the above group who requested a refill request for&#xD;
                     their eligible prescription within one year after the clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If possible, we will also use pharmacy data to assess the number of patients who&#xD;
                fill the new prescription initially.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  If possible, we will also assess the number of patients whose medication is&#xD;
                discontinued because the patient stopped taking the medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Follow-up lab visit for patients with diabetes Patients with uncontrolled diabetes are&#xD;
           recommended to have lab work every 3 months, and patients with controlled diabetes are&#xD;
           recommended to have lab work every 6 months. Completion of such lab visits is an&#xD;
           indication of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
           • Variables we will compute:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will compute the percentage of patients with uncontrolled diabetes (defined as&#xD;
                A1c &gt; 8 or A1c &gt; 9) coming in for lab work follow ups within 5 months after clinic&#xD;
                visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Denominator: Patients with uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Numerator: Patients from the above group who come in for lab work within 5&#xD;
                     months after clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will compute the percentage of patients with controlled diabetes (defined as 6.5&#xD;
                &lt; A1c &lt; 8 or 6.5 &lt; A1c &lt; 9) coming in for lab work follow ups within 12 months&#xD;
                after clinic visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Denominator: Patients with controlled diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Numerator: Patients from the above group who come in for lab work within 12&#xD;
                     months after clinic visit&#xD;
&#xD;
           Referral adherence When providers refer patients for diagnostic screenings such as&#xD;
           Colonoscopy, Fit or Mammograms, completion of these referrals is a sign of adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variables we will compute:&#xD;
&#xD;
                o We will compute the percentage of patients following through with recommended&#xD;
                screening referrals.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Denominator: Patients who are referred for Colonoscopy, Fit, or Mammogram.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Numerator: Patients from the above group who completed their screening within 6&#xD;
                months of order date&#xD;
&#xD;
           Vaccine adherence Pneummococcol vaccinations are recommended to patients ages 65 and&#xD;
           older. Completed pneummococcol vaccinations are an indication of patient adherence to&#xD;
           provider recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variables we will compute:&#xD;
&#xD;
                o We will compute the percentage of patients 65 and older who received the&#xD;
                pneumococcol vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Denominator: Patients in the clinic who are 65 and older&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Numerator: Patients from the above group who completed the pneumococcol vaccination&#xD;
                within 6 months of visit&#xD;
&#xD;
                o We will compute the percentage of patients aged 65-67, who are newly eligible to&#xD;
                receive the pneumococcol vaccination, who received the pneumococcol vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Denominator: Patients in the clinic who are between 65 and 67 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Numerator: Patients from the above group who completed the pneumococcol vaccination&#xD;
                within 6 months of visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Reduce antibiotic use&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reduction in antibiotic prescriptions While in most cases we hope to increase adherence&#xD;
           to medication prescriptions, there are many cases in which antibiotics are unnecessary.&#xD;
           For example, antibiotics are often unnecessarily prescribed for common colds,&#xD;
           bronchitis, chest colds, flu, and sore throats. A 2016 CDC report found that an&#xD;
           estimated 30% of antibiotics prescribed in outpatient settings are unnecessary. In order&#xD;
           to combat antibiotic resistant bacteria, the CDC set a 2015 goal to reduce inappropriate&#xD;
           antibiotic use in outpatient settings by 50% by 2020. Thus, reduction in overall&#xD;
           antibiotic use is a desirable outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ● Variable(s) we will compute:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will compute overall antibiotic prescriptions by looking at the number of&#xD;
                patients prescribed antibiotics at clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Denominator: Number of clinic encounters&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Numerator: Number of antibiotics prescribed&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  We will compute antibiotic prescriptions for respiratory illness by looking at the&#xD;
                number of patients with respiratory illnesses prescribed antibiotics at clinic&#xD;
                visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Denominator: Number of encounters with respiratory illness diagnoses&#xD;
                     (including bronchitis and cough/congestion)&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Numerator: Number of antibiotics prescribed at the above encounters&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Improve health outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reduction in patient BMI Reduction in BMI for patients who are overweight is an&#xD;
           indication of improved health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ● Variable(s) we will compute:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall reduction in BMI for patients who are overweight&#xD;
&#xD;
                ▪ First we will select patients with a BMI &gt; 25&#xD;
&#xD;
                ▪ Then we will compute change in BMI between visits for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reduction in BMI for patients with diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  First we will select patients who have a diagnosis of diabetes and have a BMI&#xD;
                     &gt; 25&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Then we will compute change in BMI between visits for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reduction in patient blood pressure Reduction in blood pressure for patients with&#xD;
           hypertension is an indication of improved health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Variable(s) we will compute:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Overall reduction in systolic blood pressure for patients with hypertension ▪&#xD;
                     First we will select patients with a diagnosis of hypertension ▪ Then we will&#xD;
                     compute change in blood pressure between visits for the above patients&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Overall reduction in systolic blood pressure for patients with uncontrolled&#xD;
                     hypertension ▪ First we will select patients with blood pressure &gt; 140/90 ▪&#xD;
                     Then we will compute change in blood pressure between visits for the above&#xD;
                     patients&#xD;
&#xD;
           Reduction in patient A1c levels Improved A1c control for patients with diabetes is an&#xD;
           indication of improved health outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ● Variables we will compute:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Overall reduction in A1c for patients with diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
                ▪ First we will select patients with a diagnosis of diabetes&#xD;
&#xD;
                ▪ Then we will compute change in A1c between visits for the above&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Reduction in A1c for patients with uncontrolled diabetes ▪ First we will select&#xD;
                patients with uncontrolled diabetes (A1c &gt; 8 or A1c &gt; 9) ▪ Then we will compute&#xD;
                change in A1c between visits for the above patients&#xD;
