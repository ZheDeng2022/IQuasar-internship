      Background: Most patients with thyroid cancer have a long life expectancy, and it has been&#xD;
      assumed among health professionals that therefore the quality of life (QOL) is good. Some&#xD;
      European studies have shown that the quality of life among thyroid cancers is worse than the&#xD;
      general population, and almost as low as other cancer diagnoses, with a worse prognosis and a&#xD;
      more burdening treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: To examine prospectively the quality of life in participants undergoing diagnostic&#xD;
      thyroid surgery and participants undergoing surgery for certain thyroid cancer. By examining&#xD;
      both groups we wish to find answers if quality of life is affected, and if so - mostly&#xD;
      affected by the diagnosis or the surgery itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Participants enroll the study after informed consent, and quality of life will be&#xD;
      assessed using quality of life questionnaires EORTC QLQ C30, EORTC THY 47 and EORTC FA12&#xD;
      before surgery, and 6 and 12 months after surgery. This study will form two main groups of&#xD;
      participants; with and without thyroid cancer.&#xD;

      Most patients with thyroid cancer have a long life expectancy, and it has been assumed among&#xD;
      health professionals that therefore the quality of life (QOL) is good. Some European studies&#xD;
      have shown that the QOL among thyroid cancers is worse than the general population, and&#xD;
      almost as low as other cancer diagnoses, with a worse prognosis and a more burdening&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to examine the quality of life in patients undergoing diagnostic surgery for&#xD;
      thyroid tumour(s), or thyroid surgery as part of a cancer treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will undergo standard work up and treatment for their thyroid tumour(s).&#xD;
      Clinical data will be extracted from medical records at Oslo University Hospital (OUH).&#xD;
      Questionnaires on Health related quality of life (HRQOL) are be filled out before surgery and&#xD;
      at follow up visits at 6 and 12 months after surgery. Participants that do not meet at&#xD;
      follow-up, will receive the questionnaires by mail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the study there will be three subgroups of participants: (a) Benign tumour, (b)&#xD;
      Malignant tumour with radioiodine treatment, (c) Malignant tumour without radioiodine&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires from European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) will&#xD;
      be used, as they are well validated and relatively widely used. The EORTC QLQ C30 was chosen&#xD;
      for a general view on HRQOL, as well as an available Norwegian general population for&#xD;
      comparison. For a more disease specific questionnaire, the EORTC THY47 is used, a module of&#xD;
      EORTC QLQ C30 on thyroid cancer. In addition we wish to capture a possibly important element&#xD;
      in participants undergoing thyroid surgery, and where a fraction of participants may be&#xD;
      hypothyroid for a period of time - therfore a fatigue module, the EORTC FA12 was added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calculations on sample size were performed by statistician R SÃ¸rum Falk at the Centre of&#xD;
      Biostatistics and Epidemiology of Oslo University Hospital. The global score on EORTC QLQ C30&#xD;
      in the general population had shown to be 78.0. The primary endpoint is a difference in&#xD;
      quality of life (defined as global score) before and after surgery of more than 10%. Assuming&#xD;
      an alpha of 5% , a Power of 80% and a standard error of the difference of 15, the number of&#xD;
      32 participants in each subgroup is needed. To compensate for dropouts, an additional 10% had&#xD;
      to be included, i.e. 71 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intraobserver analysis of plotting and calculations is planned.&#xD;

        Oslo University Hospital (OUH) is a regional hospital. The Ear Nose and Throat (ENT)&#xD;
        department is sharing the responsibility for diagnosis and treatment of thyroid cancer with&#xD;
        one other location within OUH. Patients planned for thyroid surgery at the ENT department&#xD;
        of OUH , will be asked to participate in the study. At the point of recruitment to the&#xD;
        study, the final diagnosis in unknown for the doctor as well as the participant, as the&#xD;
        result will come from histopathologcal examination of the surgery specimen. Participants&#xD;
        will undergo standard work up for their thyroid tumour(s), and standard treatment.&#xD;
