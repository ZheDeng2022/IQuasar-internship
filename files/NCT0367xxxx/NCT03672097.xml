    <description>The mean change in the P2Y12 reaction unit value assessed from baseline to the end of the 4-week maintenance dose treatment period, after switching from clopidogrel maintenance dose to prasugrel maintenance dose was analyzed with a paired t-test model. Mean changes (including standard deviations) are presented.</description>

    <time_frame>End of Week 4 up to Week 28 post-maintenance dose prasugrel treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>All safety events were assessed in the overall Safety Population, regardless of the study period. The incidence of major bleeding events (defined as non-coronary artery bypass grafting [CABG] thrombolysis in myocardial infarction (TIMI) major) after 28 maintenance dose treatment weeks (optional maximum 12-month P2Y12 inhibitor treatment after ACS participants underwent PCI) are reported. Non-CABG TIMI major bleeding was defined as any intracranial bleeding (excluding microhemorrhages less than 10 millimeter evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging); clinically overt signs of hemorrhage associated with a drop in hemoglobin of greater than or equal to 5 g/dL; and fatal bleeding (bleeding that directly results in death within 7 days)</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Adverse Events of Special Interest During Period 1</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to Week 4 post-maintenance dose prasugrel treatment period</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events of special interest were defined as major and minor bleeding events, clinically relevant bleeding events, and any major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Non-CABG TIMI major bleeding was defined as any intracranial bleeding (excluding microhemorrhages less than 10 millimeter evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging); clinically overt signs of hemorrhage associated with a drop in hemoglobin of greater than or equal to 5 g/dL; and fatal bleeding (bleeding that directly results in death within 7 days). Non-CABG TIMI minor bleeding was defined as clinically overt (including imaging), resulting in hemoglobin drop of 3 to less than 5 g/dL.</description>

          <title>Number of Participants With Adverse Events of Special Interest During Period 1</title>
          <description>Adverse events of special interest were defined as major and minor bleeding events, clinically relevant bleeding events, and any major adverse cardiovascular events (MACE). Non-CABG TIMI major bleeding was defined as any intracranial bleeding (excluding microhemorrhages less than 10 millimeter evident only on gradient-echo magnetic resonance imaging); clinically overt signs of hemorrhage associated with a drop in hemoglobin of greater than or equal to 5 g/dL; and fatal bleeding (bleeding that directly results in death within 7 days). Non-CABG TIMI minor bleeding was defined as clinically overt (including imaging), resulting in hemoglobin drop of 3 to less than 5 g/dL.</description>
