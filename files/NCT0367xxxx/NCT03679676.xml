  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Food allergy (FA) is a serious public health concern that causes potentially-life threatening&#xD;
      reactions in affected patients. The prevalence of food allergy in the United States (U.S.)&#xD;
      has increased substantially and now affects 15 million patients:4-8% of children (6 million&#xD;
      children, 30% with multiple food allergies) and about 9% of adults. This is a prospective&#xD;
      Phase 2, single-center, multi-allergen OIT study in participants with proven allergies to 2&#xD;
      or 3 different foods in which one must be a peanut. The total of participants in the clinical&#xD;
      study will be 110, ages 5 to 55 years with a history of multiple food allergies of 2 to 3&#xD;
      different foods including peanut. Allergy will be confirmed by FA-specific IgE levels and&#xD;
      positive skin prick test (SPT). Enrolled participants must be positive during the&#xD;
      Double-blind Placebo-controlled Food challenge (DBPCFC) at or before the 300 mg (444 mg&#xD;
      cumulative) dosing level of FA proteins.&#xD;

      This is a prospective Phase 2, single-center, multi-allergen OIT study in participants with&#xD;
      proven allergies to 2 or 3 different foods in which one must be peanut. The total population&#xD;
      will be 110 participants, ages 5 to 55 years that present with a history of multiple food&#xD;
      allergies of 2 or 3 different foods including peanut, food-allergen (FA)-specific IgE levels,&#xD;
      and positive skin prick test (SPT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled participants must react positively during DBPCFCs at or before the 300 mg (444 mg&#xD;
      cumulative) dosing level of FA proteins of 2 or 3 allergens in which one must be a peanut.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be three study cohorts, all will be double blinded:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A (50 participants) will be treated with omalizumab for 8 weeks followed by 24 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment with placebo. Cohort B (50 participants) will be treated with omalizumab for 8&#xD;
      weeks, followed by 24 weeks of treatment with dupilumab. Cohort C (10 participants) will be&#xD;
      treated with placebo for 8 weeks followed by 24 weeks treatment with dupilumab. All cohorts&#xD;
      will receive multifood allergen oral immunotherapy.&#xD;
