  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This work aims to evaluate an approach for improving federal legislators' use of&#xD;
      evidence-known as the Research-to-Policy Collaboration (RPC) - which seeks to address known&#xD;
      barriers to policymakers' use of research, including a lack of personal contact between&#xD;
      researchers and policymakers and limited relevance of research translation efforts to current&#xD;
      policy priorities. The RPC involves structured processes for identifying policymakers'&#xD;
      priorities, building researchers' capacity for nonpartisan responses to current policy&#xD;
      priorities, and facilitating ongoing and productive researcher-policymaker interactions. This&#xD;
      implementation of the RPC will focus on child and family policies relevant to child&#xD;
      maltreatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study assesses both processes for collaboration and policymakers' use of research within&#xD;
      a randomized controlled trial (RCT) employing a mixed methods approach-including quantitative&#xD;
      and qualitative evaluation of impact. The proposed project will be guided by three&#xD;
      overarching questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How does the RPC impact researchers and legislative staff?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How does the RPC impact legislative activity?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How might perceptions and experiences of collaboration through the RPC relate to&#xD;
           different forms of evidence use among researchers and policymakers?&#xD;
&#xD;
      The RPC's effectiveness will be tested through experimental design (randomization) using&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative assessments of researcher-policymaker interactions and impact.&#xD;
      This includes surveying congressional staff and researchers, reviewing records of&#xD;
      policymaker's public statements and introduced legislation, and conducting qualitative&#xD;
      interviews around researchers' and legislative staffs' experiences with&#xD;
      researcher-policymaker collaboration prior to and during the RPC.&#xD;

      Objective: The aim of this study is to examine the effectiveness of a model for supporting&#xD;
      policymakers' use of research evidence within a randomized controlled trial (RCT) employing&#xD;
      both qualitative and quantitative analyses of survey, interview, and observational data to&#xD;
      understand the use of research in policy and collaboration. Legislators' research use will be&#xD;
      assessed with multiple methods, including (1) self-report via a survey protocol, (2)&#xD;
      legislative activity (i.e., introduced bills and official statements), and (3) qualitative&#xD;
      interviews. Additionally, interviews and surveys will assess researchers' reported efficacy,&#xD;
      skill and engagement in public policy, and the extent to which their work is informed by the&#xD;
      policy process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: The Research-to-Policy Collaboration (RPC) builds upon theoretical and&#xD;
      empirical literature that suggests the need to (a) translate research relevant to current&#xD;
      policy priorities, and (b) facilitate productive interactions between policymakers and&#xD;
      researchers. The RPC is a nonpartisan, manualized model implemented by an intermediary&#xD;
      organization that cultivates relationships between researchers and legislative offices.&#xD;
      Implementation occurs in two phases involving a series of seven interrelated activities.&#xD;
      During the capacity-building phase, the RPC simultaneously aims to support researcher's&#xD;
      development of honest knowledge broker skills with training and coaching, while also&#xD;
      conducting iterative needs assessments with congressional offices regarding their current&#xD;
      priorities and desire for research evidence. In the collaboration phase, researchers with&#xD;
      relevant expertise are coalesced into rapid response teams that are matched with legislative&#xD;
      offices. Through a scaffolded series of interactions, the RPC model is used to cultivate&#xD;
      productive researcher-policymaker relationships and support responses to legislative&#xD;
      requests. Evaluating the effectiveness of the RPC is the focus of the current study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study employs both qualitative and quantitative analyses of survey, interview, and&#xD;
      observational data within the context of an RCT. Three overarching research questions guide&#xD;
      this work and align with the study's three different components - self-report via a&#xD;
      quantitative survey, observation of research use via coded legislative activity, and&#xD;
      ethnography via in-depth interviews and participant observations.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. How does the RPC impact researchers and legislative staff? (Self-Report)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Do researchers report improved policy competencies and motivation for conducting&#xD;
                policy-relevant research?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Will legislative staff report increases in positive attitudes toward, knowledge of,&#xD;
                intended application, and actual use of research evidence?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Might the impact on legislative and research participants will vary as a function&#xD;
                of aspects of their collaborative relationship (e.g., enhanced by mutual trust)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. How does the RPC impact legislative activity? (Observation)&#xD;
&#xD;
           a) Will congressional offices increase their use of research evidence in legislative&#xD;
           activities (i.e., bills, official statements)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. How might perceptions and experiences of collaboration through the RPC relate to&#xD;
           different forms of evidence use among researchers and policymakers? (Ethnography)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. What are the barriers and facilitators of participation in the RPC?&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. What types of interactions between researchers and policymakers does the RPC&#xD;
                influence?&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. How does the RPC affect participants' assumptions about each other, interactions&#xD;
                with each other, and their intentions?&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. What types of evidence use are supported by RPC participation?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sampling Framework All study components draw from an initial sampling framework through which&#xD;
      researchers and congressional staff who opt into participating in the RPC will be asked to&#xD;
      participate in the study; those who agree to participate in the study will be randomized for&#xD;
      either the full RPC intervention or a light-touch control group that receives little direct&#xD;
      engagement. This study will oversample to combat anticipated attrition. The final sample&#xD;
      includes 96 congressional offices (48 in RPC, 48 in control group) and 226 researchers (151&#xD;
      in RPC, 75 in control group). These samples were derived from an identified population of&#xD;
      eligible intervention participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A population of relevant legislative offices (Senate and House) will be identified based&#xD;
           on the number of child/family bills legislator have (co)sponsored. The random selection&#xD;
           process will be stratified to ensure proportional partisan representation and&#xD;
           representation of legislators who range in activity related to child welfare. Prior to&#xD;
           randomization, the population of relevant legislators will be assigned an Activity&#xD;
           Ranking based on the number of times a legislator has sponsored a child/family policy&#xD;
           bill. Activity Rankings will range from 1-10 such that 10% of legislators who&#xD;
           (co)sponsored the fewest bills will be ranked 1, and 10% of legislators who co-sponsored&#xD;
           the most bills will be ranked 10. Recruitment and stratified sampling across a continuum&#xD;
           of activity on child/family policy will improve bipartisan representation of the sample.&#xD;
           Also aiding with bipartisan representation are targeted outreach efforts that intensify&#xD;
           along party lines if participation becomes skewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Researchers who work on relevant child/family research will be identified via research&#xD;
           institutions, professional networks and listservs, literature searches, and referrals&#xD;
           from other researchers. Researchers include research-oriented practitioners and program&#xD;
           evaluators from both academic and non-academic settings who are interested in&#xD;
           translating their expertise with policymakers. Subsequent to opting-in to participate in&#xD;
           a policy engagement intervention, researchers are asked to participate in the study.&#xD;
           Study participants will be randomized to receive the RPC or the control condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Component 1: Quantitative Evaluation of Self-Reported RPC Impact A structured survey&#xD;
      will be used to assess researchers' capacity for engaging in public policy processes. A&#xD;
      corresponding survey protocol will assess legislative staff's attitudes, knowledge, intent,&#xD;
      and reported behavior regarding the use of research evidence. Both researchers and&#xD;
      legislative staff will be asked about the nature of their collaborative interactions with one&#xD;
      another. Surveys will be conducted approximately every three months. Survey constructs are&#xD;
      described in outcome measures. Missing data will be handled with multiple imputation because&#xD;
      this is best practice when data are not missing at random. Multilevel modelling will be used&#xD;
      to examine individual trajectories in outcome variables. Multiple regression will examine&#xD;
      changes between select time points; for instance, whether researchers' reported policy skills&#xD;
      improve between baseline and subsequent to trainings. These analyses will allow us to examine&#xD;
      whether RPC participation is associated with increases in (1) researchers' reported efficacy&#xD;
      to engage with policymakers, (2) legislative staff's interest and willingness to use research&#xD;
      evidence, and (3) both researchers' and policymakers' positive sentiment toward working&#xD;
      together. Longitudinal analyses will further allow us to explore the trajectory of outcome&#xD;
      variables over time (e.g., improved researcher competencies, legislators' use of&#xD;
      research)-specifically modelling change in evidence use and other outcomes of interest.&#xD;
      Analyses of researcher and legislative staff outcomes are all powered at least at a 90% level&#xD;
      to detect effect sizes of 0.2 or greater (power analysis conducted with Optimal Design plus&#xD;
      Empirical Evidence).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Component 2: Quantitative Evaluation of Observed RPC Impact on Legislative Activity To&#xD;
      complement the self-reported quantitative assessment of change, use of research evidence in&#xD;
      legislative activities will be observed before and following RPC participation. Data will be&#xD;
      selected, extracted, and coded prior to quantitative analyses with indicators derived from&#xD;
      deductive codes. Legislative data will be selected based upon the use of keywords indicating&#xD;
      relevance to child/family. Since each bill will comprise more text than is feasible to code&#xD;
      with traditional qualitative methods, relevant provisions will be extracted prior to coding&#xD;
      (those containing keywords). Further, all subsection titles for each sampled bill will be&#xD;
      reviewed for potential relevance and extracted if research evidence is used but not captured&#xD;
      otherwise by keywords. Data on legislative activity will be coded based on a detailed&#xD;
      codebook informed by prior findings of how research has been used by policymakers and in&#xD;
      legislation. This coding scheme will be applied by two coders and the codebook will be&#xD;
      revised and further specified until the intercoder reliability reaches at least .70 and 30%&#xD;
      of the data for the first time period has been coded. Subsequently, trained coders will code&#xD;
      individually and a lead investigator will randomly sample 10% of these to ensure consistency&#xD;
      in coding quality. These codes will be converted into quantitative indicators of research&#xD;
      use, which are described in outcome measures. Legislative activity will be assessed annually.&#xD;
      Multivariate Poisson regression analyses will assess change in research use in thematic codes&#xD;
      of (1) bills and (2) official statements between the RPC intervention and control conditions.&#xD;
      Moderation analyses will further explore the extent to which changes in legislative activity&#xD;
      depend on the nature of collaboration experiences, other survey data (e.g., policymakers'&#xD;
      perceptions of the value of research), and legislator characteristics (e.g., party&#xD;
      affiliation, years of age).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Component 3: Ethnographic Evaluation of the RPC model The qualitative component of this&#xD;
      study is closely linked with the quantitative work and seeks to better understand the&#xD;
      experiences of RPC participants and processes underlying the use of research evidence in the&#xD;
      RPC context. Using participatory and ethnographic methods, data will be collected from two&#xD;
      sources: (1) semi-structured interviews of trial participants and RPC staff, and (2)&#xD;
      observations of researcher trainings and researcher-staff meetings. Interview participants&#xD;
      will be sampled from the pool of study participants randomly assigned to receive the RPC,&#xD;
      including 11 RPC researchers and 11 RPC congressional office staff that will be interviewed&#xD;
      prior to their involvement in the RPC, and 11 RPC researchers and 11 congressional office&#xD;
      staff that will be interviewed following collaboration activities via the RPC. Additionally,&#xD;
      3 RPC staff will be interviewed prior to and following the RPC. To gain additional insight&#xD;
      into the RPC operations and impact, observations will be conducted of trainings for&#xD;
      researchers, formal meetings and informal interactions between researchers and congressional&#xD;
      staff, and meetings that occur as part of any RPC collaboration. Following ethnographic best&#xD;
      practices, &quot;open-observations&quot; of key meetings and training events will be conducted to&#xD;
      enrich the interviews with more information about how attendees interact and how they respond&#xD;
      to the RPC. Field notes and transcripts will be analysed with thematic analysis and an&#xD;
      interpretive policy analysis that explores different rationalities and rhetoric when&#xD;
      discussing evidence used in the collaboration.&#xD;
