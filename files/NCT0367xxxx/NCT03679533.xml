  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tremendous progress has been made in characterizing the interactions between the central&#xD;
      nervous system and the gastrointestinal tract. This concept of a gut-brain axis suggests that&#xD;
      influencing bacteria in the gut is a promising approach for developing new ways of benefiting&#xD;
      brain function. This is particularly relevant for an ageing population for which cognitive&#xD;
      decline is a common symptom and can be an indicator for the development of neurodegenerative&#xD;
      conditions such as dementia. There is good evidence already that nutrition can delay the&#xD;
      development of cognitive decline in ageing, in particular for ageing-sensitive brain regions&#xD;
      such as the medial temporal lobe, however this has been little explored for cranberry intake.&#xD;
      Cranberries are high in plant-derived nutrients called polyphenols, which have been suggested&#xD;
      to promote brain function and protect against disease-causing mechanisms. In the proposed&#xD;
      project we will pioneer work to investigate the impact of cranberry intake on gut bacteria&#xD;
      and how it relates to cognitive performance in ageing and associated regions in the brain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being conducted by Chief Investigators Dr David Vauzour and Prof Michael&#xD;
      Hornberger at the University of East Anglia. Sixty participants (i.e. n=30 control and&#xD;
      treatment groups) aged 50-80 years old, with no memory complaints will be recruited for this&#xD;
      12-week double-blind placebo-controlled parallel intervention of cranberry flavonoids.&#xD;
      Freeze-dried cranberry or a matched placebo will be taken twice daily for the duration of the&#xD;
      trial. Blood, urine and faecal samples will be collected for microbiome, DNA, biochemical and&#xD;
      nutritional analysis. Participants will also undergo cognitive testing, as well as MRI&#xD;
      scanning to detect changes in brain physiology.&#xD;
