  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure changes in cognitive (mental) function in cancer&#xD;
      survivors using a brief, reliable, game-like set of tests that can be completed outside the&#xD;
      clinic, as an alternative to traditional neurocognitive assessments. This set of computerized&#xD;
      tests, the Cogsuite Assessment, is expected to improve our ability to identify cognitive&#xD;
      impairments in people who have been treated for cancer, so that we can (1) learn more about&#xD;
      which cognitive functions are affected by cancer treatment, and (2) guide that treatment more&#xD;
      effectively.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Enformia Cognition will provide a web URL (https://www.cogsuite.com/testme) that&#xD;
                  participants can use to check if they have the minimum requirements. The URL will&#xD;
                  clearly state if the user has adequate hardware using green and red text and&#xD;
                  symbols. The test URL will also return a short 5 sequence numeric validation code&#xD;
                  (xx-xxx) for each browser checked. The validation code will allow Enformia to&#xD;
                  lookup the specific hardware that was tested. Research Associates can direct&#xD;
                  prospects to the test web URL during their phone screen.&#xD;
