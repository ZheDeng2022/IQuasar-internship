  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Digital case management systems have the potential to increase compliance with&#xD;
      protocol-driven treatment, reduce treatment abandonment and ultimately help to close the&#xD;
      discrepancy in pediatric cancer outcomes between Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) and&#xD;
      high-income countries (HICs). The investigators aim to adapt an open-source digital case&#xD;
      management platform to incorporate standardized pediatric oncology protocols. Effectiveness&#xD;
      will be evaluated by provider protocol compliance (primary outcome) and patient treatment&#xD;
      abandonment rates using the digital case management system as compared to historic controls.&#xD;
      The study population will include patients diagnosed with Burkitt lymphoma, Diffuse large&#xD;
      B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or retinoblastoma at Bugando Medical Centre in Tanzania.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Each year, approximately 220,000 children globally are newly diagnosed with cancer. Over 85%&#xD;
      of these new diagnoses are made in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Survival rates&#xD;
      in LMICs are 5-25% compared to 80% in high-income countries (HICs). One of the primary&#xD;
      contributors to the discrepancy in survival outcomes between LMICs and HICs is a high rate of&#xD;
      treatment abandonment, defined as refusal to initiate or failure to complete curative&#xD;
      treatment. Treatment abandonment rate in Tanzania is higher than in other LMICs (40% compared&#xD;
      to 10-25%), directly impacting patient survival. In HICs, protocol-driven treatment for&#xD;
      children with cancer has led to increased treatment compliance and large improvements in&#xD;
      survival. However, it is often not feasible or appropriate to use protocol-driven treatment&#xD;
      in LMICs without necessary supportive care, human resources and infrastructure. Not&#xD;
      surprisingly, protocol-related compliance is lower in LMICs compared to HICs. Digital&#xD;
      technologies for health (i.e., digital health) can facilitate implementation of and&#xD;
      compliance with standardized pediatric oncology protocols through step-by-step decision&#xD;
      support algorithms, reminders and alerts related to patient visits, and timely data for&#xD;
      health service coordination with allied health providers (e.g., nurses, pharmacists etc.).&#xD;
      This multidisciplinary team from Duke University and Dimagi Inc. in USA, and Bugando Medical&#xD;
      Centre (BMC) in Tanzania, proposes to adapt, implement, and evaluate a digital case&#xD;
      management system, called mNavigator, at BMC to improve health provider compliance with&#xD;
      standardized pediatric oncology protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 1, mNavigator development will initially focus on the two nationally-approved&#xD;
      protocols for Burkitt lymphoma and retinoblastoma. The treatment for Diffuse large B-cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (DLBCL) follows the Burkitt lymphoma treatment protocol. Using principles of&#xD;
      persuasive system design and the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR),&#xD;
      prompts that guide users through protocol implementation will be used as behavioral triggers&#xD;
      to assist with perceived ease of use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For Aim 2, allied health providers at BMC will receive training on using mNavigator as part&#xD;
      of an in-country workshop led by the M-PIs. This training will be followed by supported&#xD;
      implementation. Following this training period, mNavigator will be used to enroll pediatric&#xD;
      patients at BMC with pre-clinical diagnosis of BL, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or&#xD;
      Rb, over a period of over one and a half years and manage their care for the duration of&#xD;
      treatment (up to 3 months for BL and DLBCL, and 4 months for Rb). BMC receives and treats&#xD;
      approximately 150 patients every year, with an estimated 50 patients annually with Burkitt&#xD;
      lymphoma (BL), Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) or Rb. To review historic compliance,&#xD;
      files of patients diagnosed after 2015 with BL, Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and Rb&#xD;
      (when protocols were introduced) will be abstracted by trained research assistants.&#xD;
      Compliance with protocol-driven treatment will be monitored using mNavigator. System&#xD;
      functionality will be assessed. Semi-structured assessments of provider system acceptance and&#xD;
      usability will be conducted along with elucidating caregiver reported barriers to treatment&#xD;
      completion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective is to describe factors that facilitate or inhibit implementation of&#xD;
      mNavigator.&#xD;
