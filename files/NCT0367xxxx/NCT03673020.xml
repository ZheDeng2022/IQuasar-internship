      This is a Phase 1a study to evaluate neoantigen vaccine, AutoSynVax (ASV®) AGEN2017 in&#xD;
      subjects with resected solid tumors, no evidence of disease (NED), and with an estimated life&#xD;
      expectancy of ≥12 months from the time tissue has been submitted for vaccine manufacture. A&#xD;
      minimum of 3 subjects will be enrolled to receive every two weeks subcutaneous injection of&#xD;
      AGEN2017 + QS-21 adjuvant.&#xD;

&#xD;
          2. Age ≥18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Diagnosis of solid cancer that has been completely resected, NED, and eligible for&#xD;
             observation only as SOC yet remain at risk of relapse per Investigator discretion.&#xD;
             These include subjects diagnosed with malignant melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer,&#xD;
             bladder cancer, colorectal cancer, breast cancer, renal cancer, head and neck cancer,&#xD;
             cervical cancer, and soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Life expectancy ≥12 months from the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Available fresh tissue from surgical excision. If fresh tissue is not available,&#xD;
             formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded archival tissue may be used. The modality of the&#xD;
             biopsy (e.g., endobronchial ultrasound, bronchoscopic, computed-tomography-guided&#xD;
             needle biopsy) is not specified; however, core biopsy and fine needle aspiration are&#xD;
             acceptable as long as the biopsy can be prepared as a cell block in paraffin-embedded&#xD;
             tissue.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status 0 or 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Adequate bone marrow function, as measured from studies of peripheral blood (absolute&#xD;
             neutrophil count ≥1,500/mm3, absolute lymphocyte count ≥500/mm3, platelet count&#xD;
             50,000/mm3, hemoglobin &gt;8.0 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Adequate cardiac function (New York Heart Association class ≤II).&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Female subjects of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test at&#xD;
             the screening and pretreatment visits, and prior to first dose of study medication.&#xD;
             Non-childbearing potential (other than by medical reasons) is defined as 1 of the&#xD;
             following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ≥45 years of age and amenorrheic for &gt;1 year by self-report.&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Amenorrheic for &gt;2 years without a hysterectomy and oophorectomy, and&#xD;
                  follicle-stimulating hormone value in the postmenopausal range upon screening&#xD;
                  evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Status post-hysterectomy, -oophorectomy, or -tubal ligation. If of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential, female subjects must be willing to use adequate birth control during&#xD;
                  the study, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after the last dose&#xD;
                  of study therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Male subjects with a female partner(s) of childbearing potential must agree to use a&#xD;
             condom throughout the trial, starting with the screening visit through 120 days after&#xD;
             the last dose of study therapy. Male subjects with pregnant partners must agree to use&#xD;
             a condom; no additional method of contraception is required for the pregnant partner.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Note: Abstinence is acceptable for both female and male subjects if this is the&#xD;
             subject's established and preferred contraception method.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subject is willing and able to comply with the requirements of the protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             the following intervals before first dose of study drug:&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                    -  Physiologic steroid replacement for adrenal insufficiency (e.g., &lt;10 mg&#xD;
                       prednisone per day) is permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Prophylactic use of inhaled or topical corticosteroid or short course of&#xD;
                       intravenous systemic corticosteroid (≤3 days) for radiographic procedures is&#xD;
                       permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Use of physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy must be approved by&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. ≤7 days for immunosuppressive treatment for any reason. Systemic corticosteroids&#xD;
                  are not allowed except as defined above.&#xD;

             the first dose of study drug. Subjects are not to receive anti-cancer therapies from&#xD;
             date of consent through the post treatment visit (end of treatment or final safety&#xD;
             visit).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Diagnosis of clinically significant immunodeficiency (as defined by the principal&#xD;
             investigator), or actively receiving or potentially needing any form of&#xD;
             immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the first dose of study drug until&#xD;
             the end of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. History or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory abnormality that&#xD;
             might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's participation&#xD;
             for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of the subject to&#xD;
             participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator or medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Uncontrolled intercurrent illness, including but not limited to uncontrolled&#xD;
             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris,&#xD;
             uncontrolled cardiac arrhythmia, or social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements in the opinion of the treating investigator or medical monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History of intolerance or allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar&#xD;
             chemical or biologic composition to AGEN2017 or QS-21 adjuvant.&#xD;
&#xD;
