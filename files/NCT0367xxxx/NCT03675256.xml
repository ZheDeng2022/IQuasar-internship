      Study Description&#xD;
&#xD;
      The KEN SHE Study aims to identify effective cervical cancer prevention strategies. Cervical&#xD;
      cancer is caused by an infection with Human Papillomavirus, also called HPV. In Kenya, about&#xD;
      2,500 women die from this condition each year. The study is conducted by Kenya Medical&#xD;
      Research Institute (KEMRI) sites, based in Kisumu, Thika and Nairobi and the University of&#xD;
      Washington, Seattle, USA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to learn whether a single dose of the HPV vaccine prevents HPV&#xD;
      infection among adolescents and young women. Using a single dose will lower the cost of&#xD;
      providing HPV vaccination (compared to two doses) and will make it possible for more women to&#xD;
      receive the vaccination and be protected from cervical cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve approximately 15 clinic visits over a period of 37 months. All visits&#xD;
      will involve blood draws and many will involve pelvic swabs. Participants will receive an&#xD;
      FDA-approved HPV vaccine and a meningococcal vaccine.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cervical cancer is the leading cause of new cancer cases among women in Africa. Preliminary&#xD;
      evidence suggests a single-dose of the HPV vaccine would be over 95% effective in preventing&#xD;
      vaccine type-specific HIV infection, supporting HPV vaccination as a scaleable intervention&#xD;
      for cervical cancer prevention. The overall aim of the study is to provide timely results of&#xD;
      both single-dose HPV vaccine efficacy and estimates of the cost, cost-effectiveness, and&#xD;
      budget impact for dissemination and translation to policy. Several HPV vaccines are&#xD;
      available. The KEN SHE Study will determine the efficacy of two HPV vaccines: bivalent and&#xD;
      nonavalent vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the start of the study, young women will be randomly sorted into three arms. In arm 1, the&#xD;
      women will receive the bivalent HPV vaccine. In arm 2, the women will receive the nonavalent&#xD;
      HPV vaccine. And in arm 3, the women will receive a meningococcal vaccine. At the end of the&#xD;
      study, those in arms 1 and 2 will receive the meningococcal vaccine, while those in arm 3&#xD;
      will receive either the bivalent or nonavalent HPV vaccine. The three-arm study structure&#xD;
      makes it possible to compare the women who received an HPV vaccine to those who did not&#xD;
      receive an HPV vaccine during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal results of the study will demonstrate whether the single-dose HPV vaccine&#xD;
      strategy prevents incident persistent HPV vaccine type specific infection among young women,&#xD;
      by comparing the rate of new HPV infections among women who receive the vaccine immediately&#xD;
      to those receiving delayed vaccination. Further, among the women who receive immediate HPV&#xD;
      vaccine, investigators will estimate the durability of the bivalent and nonavalent HPV&#xD;
      vaccines by measuring the antibody response and cumulative incidence of persistent cervical&#xD;
      HPV over the duration of follow-up. Specifically, investigators will compare the incidence of&#xD;
      high-risk vaccine HPV types overall and the distribution of HPV types by study arm.&#xD;
      Investigators will assess the immunologic response to single-dose HPV vaccination,&#xD;
      specifically regarding long lasting B cell responses to support the durability of the&#xD;
      single-dose vaccination approach. Data on the magnitude of the antibody response at months 1&#xD;
      and 24 will support immunobridging analyses to young girls and adolescents. The 24 month&#xD;
      antibody result will be used to assess durability of the response and will be directly&#xD;
      comparable to other studies of the single-dose HPV vaccine which are uniformly using the&#xD;
      month 24 antibody result as the primary outcome. Costing analyses will assess the resources&#xD;
      required for scale-up of single-dose HPV vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment is anticipated to take 12 months, with 37 months of follow-up for each&#xD;
      participant. A formal primary analysis will be conducted after 18 months of follow-up to&#xD;
      provide early evidence on single-dose HPV vaccine efficacy. The endpoint-driven trial design&#xD;
      among women at risk of HPV acquisition will provide primary results after 18 months of&#xD;
      follow-up, and, with the extended follow-up, evidence on durability over three years. The&#xD;
      study duration is 60 months.&#xD;
