    <description>The treatment combination period can only begin after the planned dose of venetoclax is reached. Depending on the administration dosing schedule, the combination treatment at the planned doses may be preceded by a 2-week Lead-In Dose period of S64315 (fixed dose) during which the patient continues to receive venetoclax daily. Once the planned dose of both drugs is reached the schedule will be a 21-day cycle with a weekly regimen for S64315 and a daily regimen for venetoclax.&#xD;
S64315 should be administered 2 to 4 hours after venetoclax intake, via IV infusion. The dose escalation will start at 50 mg once a week and doses up to 250 mg once a week might be explored.&#xD;
Venetoclax will be administered orally once a day. The dose escalation will start at 100 mg daily and doses up to 600 mg daily might be explored. Venetoclax must be taken with a meal (ideally during breakfast) in order to avoid reduced efficacy.</description>
