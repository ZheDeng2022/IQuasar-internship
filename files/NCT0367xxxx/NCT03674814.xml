      The study is an open-label Phase 1 study of the combination of relacorilant with enzalutamide&#xD;
      in patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in 6 patient cohorts with a 6+3 design and a 28 day DLT period. Doses of&#xD;
      relacorilant, enzalutamide will be adjusted based on safety and pharmacokinetics (PK). Once a&#xD;
      safe dose with appropriate drug levels (PK) has been established, the cohort will be expanded&#xD;
      to a total of 12 patients to refine safety and PK at the recommended phase II dose (RP2D).&#xD;
