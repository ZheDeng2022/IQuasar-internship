      Comparison of effectiveness of preoperative Gabapentin with Celecoxib in reducing acute&#xD;
      postoperative pain in abdominal hysterectomy, A randomized double blind controlled trial&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Total abdominal hysterectomy (TAH) is the most common gynecological operation worldwide.Some&#xD;
      studies noticed about overused of opioids in postoperative care , leaded to more adverse&#xD;
      effect of opioids , slowly recovery , prolong length of hospitalized stay and consequently&#xD;
      increase unnecessary cost of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ERAS guidelines has considered to use preoperative analgesics for reducing post-operative&#xD;
      opioids consumption, including Gabapentin and Celecoxib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gabapentin and celecoxib widely used for treatment of pain and many studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      the preoperative efficacy and safety of Gabapentin and Celecoxib in variety procedures&#xD;
      involving hysterectomy.However, no definite conclusion of optimal dose and timing for&#xD;
      preopearive uptake ,apart from no good evidences based supported preoperative Gabapentin or&#xD;
      Celecoxib in hysterectomy in Thailand . In addition, the protocol for preoperative analgesics&#xD;
      in hysterectomy, has not been performed in the investigator's center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore the aim of this study is to assess and compare the efficacy and safety of&#xD;
      preoperative Gabapentin and Celecoxib to reduce acute postoperative pain in non-gynecological&#xD;
      cancerous woman undergoing total abdominal hysterectomy&#xD;
