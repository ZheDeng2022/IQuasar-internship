  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pulmonary hemorrhage can be severe and life-threatening. In children, etiologies of pulmonary&#xD;
      hemorrhage include respiratory infection, foreign bodies, bronchiectasis, pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      disorders, parenchymal lung disease, and post-surgical complications. Initial management of&#xD;
      pulmonary hemorrhage includes stabilization of the patient, securing the airway, initiative&#xD;
      high positive end-expiratory pressure to attempt to tamponade the source of hemorrhage and&#xD;
      repletion with blood products. Following stabilization of the patient, investigation and&#xD;
      further management of hemorrhage includes bronchoscopy, surgery, or catheterization. Sources&#xD;
      of bleeding such as endobronchial lesions are often identified and managed with bronchoscopy&#xD;
      and the instillation of vasoactive medications or cold water to induce vasospasm and/or&#xD;
      balloon tamponade. Vascular bleeding can be surgically ligated or embolized via&#xD;
      catheterization. Unidentifiable bleeding occurs with distal vascular injury and is limited to&#xD;
      attempted catheter guided embolization of bleeding vessels if found, supportive treatment,&#xD;
      and correction of a coagulopathy if present. As etiologies of pulmonary hemorrhage vary,&#xD;
      outcomes and prognosis in pediatric pulmonary hemorrhage are difficult to determine, however,&#xD;
      mortality still remains a risk.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tranexamic acid (TXA) is a lysine analog that blocks the conversion of plasminogen to plasmin&#xD;
      and the interaction with fibrin, preventing blood clot breakdown, thereby reducing bleeding.&#xD;
      The United States (US) Food and Drug Administration approved the intravenous formulation of&#xD;
      TXA for the treatment of bleeding patients with hemophilia in 1986 and the oral formulation&#xD;
      for the use of severe menorrhagia in 2009. In 2011, The World Health Organization listed TXA&#xD;
      as an essential medication based on its successful use in adult trauma-related hemorrhage.&#xD;
      Studies show the successful off-label use of TXA in children for congenital heart surgery,&#xD;
      orthopedic procedures, neurosurgical procedures, trauma, immune thrombocytopenic purpura,&#xD;
      epistaxis, hemorrhage complicating a procedure, bilateral lung transplantation, chemotherapy&#xD;
      injections, and bone marrow biopsies among other diagnoses and procedures. Very little data&#xD;
      on the use of TXA for pediatric pulmonary hemorrhage exists. Only two case reports show TXA&#xD;
      controlling hemoptysis in children with cystic fibrosis-related hemoptysis. A systematic&#xD;
      review concluded that the use of TXA for hemoptysis was associated with a significant&#xD;
      reduction in length of bleeding. A recent randomized control trial showed the TXA decreased&#xD;
      the severity of the hemoptysis and may be used as a bridge to other interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The powerful anti-fibrinolytic properties and relatively low side-effect profile lend TXA to&#xD;
      the off-label use in children to reduce bleeding in other diagnoses. There are not enough&#xD;
      studies and data, however, to recommend the routine use of TXA in hemoptysis.&#xD;
