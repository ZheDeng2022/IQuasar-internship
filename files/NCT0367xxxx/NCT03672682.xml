  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Large-cell B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is the most common non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and accounts for&#xD;
      about 40% of new cases. Although the DLBCL is a single entity in the WHO classification,&#xD;
      several subgroups with different prognoses are recognized. These subgroups take into account&#xD;
      the tumor localization (primitive cerebral lymphoma, serous lymphoma, intravascular or&#xD;
      exclusive lymph node) or a particular molecular signature (GCB profile, germline center B&#xD;
      cell or ABC, activated B cell). Despite the introduction of immunotherapy, treatment failures&#xD;
      are common. Overall survival at 5 years is estimated to be between 26 and 73%. This&#xD;
      highlights the important heterogeneity of this pathology and therefore the need for&#xD;
      biomarkers prognosis. Recently, an increase in monocytes in the blood of DLBCL patients has&#xD;
      been proposed as a prognostic factor for independent survival. This marker of poor prognosis&#xD;
      is also found in many solid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monocytes are effectors of the inflammatory response. They have different functional profiles&#xD;
      depending on the level of expression of CD14 and CD16. Four subtypes of monocytes are&#xD;
      distinguished: classical (CD14posCD16neg), intermediate (CD14posCD16pos) and non-classical&#xD;
      (CD14lowCD16pos); the latter population is divided into two sub-groups depending on the&#xD;
      expression of the SLAN protein. The different monocytic subpopulations have very diverse&#xD;
      functions ranging from an immunosuppressive profile to an activation of the immune system.&#xD;
      CD14posCD16neg monocytes are specialized in phagocytosis, production of oxygen derivatives&#xD;
      (ROS) and pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion in response to microbial infection.&#xD;
      CD14dimCD16pos monocytes are specialized in immune surveillance and produce proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines such as TNFα and IL-1β in response to LPS stimulation.7 The Slanpos subpopulation&#xD;
      produces IL-12 and thus has pro-inflammatory properties. Finally, CD14posCD16pos monocytes&#xD;
      have controversial functions. For some authors, they produce the immunomodulatory cytokine&#xD;
      IL-10, inhibit the proliferation of CD4 T lymphocytes and induce the recruitment of&#xD;
      regulatory T lymphocytes, while for others they produce TNF-α, a pro- inflammatory.From a&#xD;
      practical point of view CD14 and CD16 expression forms a continuum, which translates into&#xD;
      complexity in the phenotypic definition of these cells and explains the contradictory data on&#xD;
      their functionalities. Interestingly, in a laboratory work and in the course of publication,&#xD;
      this fraction is increased in the blood of DLBCL patients compared to healthy donors&#xD;
      (manuscript in preparation), on the contrary the monocytic fraction CD14dimCD16 pos is&#xD;
      decreased in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the end, if the increase in monocytes is known to be poor prognosis in patients with&#xD;
      DLBCL, the monocyte fraction involved and the monocytic functions involved in this phenomenon&#xD;
      are not known.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since 2011, the Clinical and Biological Hematology Services have a database from a research&#xD;
      protocol (BMS_LyTrans). This protocol includes patients with DLBCL as well as healthy&#xD;
      patients, in order to allow the biological characterization of biomarkers in this pathology.&#xD;
      Thus, we have blood samples and analysis of certain monocyte subtypes by flow cytometry at&#xD;
      diagnosis, in more than 100 patients with DLBCL.&#xD;

      Primary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe and compare the distribution of the different monocytic subpopulations according to&#xD;
      the chemosensitivity profile (group 1) or chemoresistance (group 2) of patients with DLBCL&#xD;
      and healthy donors (group 3), and identify their specific functionalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine the prognostic impact in terms of progression-free survival (EFS) of the&#xD;
      distribution of the monocytic sub-population (s) defined i during the primary objective, in a&#xD;
      retrospective study (BMS Ly Trans)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design/Methodology : Retrospective, observational, monocentric study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Part 1: Phenotypic and functional study of monocytic sub - populations of patients&#xD;
           with DLBCL.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Patient selection from the BMS_LyTrans database : Group 1: 15 patients with DLBCL with&#xD;
           chemoresistance or relapse less than 2 years after completion of first-line therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 2: 15 patients with DLBCL with chemosensitivity without relapse within 2 years&#xD;
           following the end of first-line treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group 3: 15 healthy patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
           A - Irish Lab (Nashville)&#xD;
&#xD;
           - Phenotypic analysis by mass cytometry: This new technology allows the integration of&#xD;
           multiple data with membrane markers, intracytoplasmic proteins as well as transcription&#xD;
           factors, thus providing global modeling of signaling pathways&#xD;
&#xD;
           B - UMR 917 (Rennes) 8 months Cell sorting: The four subtypes of monocytes described&#xD;
           above will be sorted by flow cytometry according to the expression of CD14, CD16 and&#xD;
           Slan.&#xD;
&#xD;
           - High-throughput transcriptional analysis: cell lysis and real-time PCR in order to&#xD;
           study the expression of genes involved in the mechanisms of&#xD;
           immunomodulation.Bio-informatics, Integrated analysis: The set of clinical,&#xD;
           transcriptomic and proteomic data will be analyzed in an integrated way using tools and&#xD;
           algorithms working within the Irish lab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - 2nd part (Rennes) - 6 months : Populations differentially expressed between groups in&#xD;
           part 1 will be analyzed on a cohort of 100 samples. These parameters will be analyzed&#xD;
           jointly after integration in a database, uni- and multivariate analysis and the survival&#xD;
           probability will be calculated for groups with a log-rank test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected benefits :&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - To allow a better understanding of the monocyte compartment in DLBCL, particularly&#xD;
           with regard to the immunosuppressive capacity of some of these cellular subtypes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - To refine the interest of the biomarker &quot;monocyte level&quot; on EFS in patients with&#xD;
           DLBCL, highlighting the monocyte subtype involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - To continue the collaboration between the two sites, which will allow to combine&#xD;
           technologies and expertise present in Rennes (patient recruitment, cell sorting,&#xD;
           molecular analysis (Biomark)) or in Nashville (CyTOF, bioinformatics, integrated&#xD;
           analysis).&#xD;
