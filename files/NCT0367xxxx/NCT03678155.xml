      The present investigation aims at exploring the effect of including a pain app called Pain&#xD;
      Monitor for chronic pain patients' daily monitoring. Two conditions will be set:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. usual treatment + app (without alarms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. usual treatment + app (with alarms)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is defined as one that lasts for at least three to six months, provided that&#xD;
      this time is greater than the normal healing period of an injury. This pathology has become&#xD;
      an important public health problem due to its high prevalence. In particular, it is estimated&#xD;
      that it affects 20-30% of the adult population around the world. Medical interventions are&#xD;
      the first-line treatment in recent clinical practice guidelines. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      effectiveness of medical interventions is only modest. Treatments significantly reduce pain&#xD;
      on average, but the effect tends to be small. In addition, the drugs are not effective for a&#xD;
      large percentage of patients. What these and other research suggest is that focusing only on&#xD;
      large sample studies and the use of average change scores calls into question the usefulness&#xD;
      of current patient-centered treatments. As noted by Dr. Turk, when data are averaged, various&#xD;
      pain syndromes, drugs, surgical procedures, and studies in different countries are often&#xD;
      included, which may mask the efficacy results of different treatments with Different samples.&#xD;
      Single case methodology could be one of the ways to overcome these limitations. The single&#xD;
      case investigation is a type of experimental study that offers experimental control within a&#xD;
      single case. Some studies have already demonstrated the usefulness of these designs in&#xD;
      chronic pain. In fact, the benefits of using this methodology as opposed to large sample&#xD;
      studies were discussed recently during the 10th Congress of the European Pain Federation.&#xD;
      These benefits include the need for a reduced number of participants, the ability to follow&#xD;
      clinical evolution in real time and continuously, the amount of data provided, and&#xD;
      applicability when using a control group is impractical or unethical. The investigators&#xD;
      conducting the present investigation recently conducted a study at the Pain Unit of the Vall&#xD;
      d'Hebron Hospital to explore the effectiveness of current medical treatments. According to&#xD;
      previous investigations, the treatment effect was only small (d = 0.32) and only a percentage&#xD;
      of the patients (18.1%) had a clinically significant reduction of pain (ie a reduction&#xD;
      greater than 30% ). From these results and the literature reviewed, a single case design&#xD;
      could be an alternative method for research in the Pain Unit. However, the implementation of&#xD;
      this type of methodology can be very costly due to the continuous evaluation of the evolution&#xD;
      of the patient. In this sense, several studies have already shown that mobile applications&#xD;
      (app) can effectively control the evolution of a wide range of pathologies in health&#xD;
      settings. In fact, a recent controlled clinical study found that ecological records performed&#xD;
      with mobile app had greater reliability than paper-and-pencil records. Rosser and Eccleston&#xD;
      conducted a comprehensive review of existing apps for pain and the conclusion was that there&#xD;
      was little evidence to support the use of current apps. Specifically, these authors showed&#xD;
      that most apps did not specify whether their content was validated, did not include&#xD;
      psychological components and none had been applied in a clinical study. In light of these&#xD;
      results, Dr. Carlos Suso Ribera and Dr. Ribera Canudas contacted the research team Labpsitec&#xD;
      of Jaume I University, who were developing an application for pain called &quot;Pain Monitor&quot;. Dr.&#xD;
      Carlos Suso Ribera and Dr. Ribera Canudas of the Pain Unit collaborated with Dr. Azucena&#xD;
      García Palacios and Dr. Diana Castilla López of the Universitat Jaume I in the final&#xD;
      development of the application of pain, Following the guidelines of Rosser and Eccleston. App&#xD;
      content validity and usability was tested in a previous study at the pain unit of the Vall&#xD;
      d'Hebron Hospital. Thus, the study objective is to test if the introduction of this tool in&#xD;
      the day-to-day work of the pain unit improves pain management of chronic pain patients. To do&#xD;
      this, it is necessary to compare the evolution of patients who follow the usual treatment at&#xD;
      the pain unit (without app) with a group of patients who do use the Pain Monitor app. In&#xD;
      addition, the present study investigators have created a new utility that allows alarms to be&#xD;
      generated by healthcare professionals in the presence of an undesired event, such as an&#xD;
      adverse effect of the medication or a lack of response to medical treatment. Before&#xD;
      determining that both the use of the app and this new utility (alarms) are beneficial for&#xD;
      patient care, it is necessary to perform a clinical trial comparing the 3 conditions&#xD;
      mentioned above:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. usual treatment + app (without alarms)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. usual treatment + app (with alarms) Therefore, this is a clinical trial without drugs.&#xD;
           This is not an observational study since the physicians of patients in the app + alarms&#xD;
           condition will be asked to react to an alarm (i.e., if the patient has nausea for 3&#xD;
           consecutive days) by calling the patient and changing the treatment telematically, if&#xD;
           necessary, so that the patient can collect the prescription at his primary care center.&#xD;
           If the condition app with alarms results in a better treatment of chronic pain patients,&#xD;
           participants of the other two conditions will be offered the possibility to use the app&#xD;
           with alarms at the end of the study. The study will be conducted at the Pain Unit of the&#xD;
           Vall d'Hebron Hospital. All study procedures have been approved by the ethical committee&#xD;
           of the Vall d'Hebron Hospital.&#xD;
