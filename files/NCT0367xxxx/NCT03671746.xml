    <textblock>
      It is unknown whether early modulation of inflammatory cytokines is associated with improved&#xD;
      patient outcomes, reduced narcotic requirements in orthopaedic patient population, and&#xD;
      improved patient subjective pain after hospital discharge. Preliminary animal and clinical&#xD;
      studies have shown correlation between elevated blood cytokine concentrations during the&#xD;
      acute phase of trauma and the development of post-traumatic complications. Early&#xD;
      administration of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) in animals significantly&#xD;
      reduced inflammatory profiles, improved pulmonary edema, and enhanced arteriole&#xD;
      vasoconstriction in response to hemorrhage. The ability to modify post-traumatic physiologic&#xD;
      response via short-term administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) may&#xD;
      lead to improved patient outcome. In addition, given the current landscape for opioid&#xD;
      epidemic in the United States, alternative non-opioid pain management during acute trauma has&#xD;
      the potential to reduce opioid consumption and represents a pivotal component of multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia strategy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By doing this study, the investigators hope to learn how to provide the best care for all&#xD;
      patients in the state of Kentucky. Patient participation in this research will last about 1&#xD;
      year.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Accidental trauma is the 4th leading cause of death in the United States, and it is&#xD;
      associated with a complex inflammatory response. This response is associated with&#xD;
      post-traumatic complications such as; multi-organ dysfunction syndrome (MODS), bacterial&#xD;
      pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), systemic inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome (SIRS), and post traumatic pain (PTP). It is unknown whether early modulation of&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines is associated with improved patient outcomes, reduced narcotic&#xD;
      requirements, and improved patient subjective pain after hospital discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary data has shown: (1) elevated blood cytokine concentrations during the acute phase&#xD;
      of trauma are correlated with the development of fatal post-traumatic complications, (2) that&#xD;
      early administration of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) resulted in decreased&#xD;
      blood serum levels of IL-6, Prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), improved pulmonary edema, and enhanced&#xD;
      arterioles ability to vasoconstrict in response to hemorrhage in animal models, and (3) that&#xD;
      the addition of the internal physiologic parameters (inflammatory cytokines) to New Injury&#xD;
      Severity Score (NISS - a marker of the external anatomical insult) significantly improves the&#xD;
      ability to predict hospital length of stay of trauma patients when compared to NISS alone.&#xD;
      The investigator's group is the first to use an integrative approach that combines the&#xD;
      external anatomic injury data with the internal physiologic response for accurate prediction&#xD;
      of patient's clinical outcome. Therefore, if the investigators apply this same mindset to&#xD;
      treatment, the investigators can improve the trauma patients' care by addressing both&#xD;
      parameters as opposed to solely focusing on the external injury as done in the past. The&#xD;
      ability to modify post-traumatic physiologic response via short-term administration of a&#xD;
      NSAID may lead to improved patient outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the last decade, clinicians remain puzzled over the safety of NSAID administration after&#xD;
      fracture in terms of bone union. In addition, given the current landscape for opioid epidemic&#xD;
      in the United States, alternative non-opioid pain management during acute trauma has the&#xD;
      potential to reduce opioid consumption and represents a pivotal component of multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia strategy.&#xD;
