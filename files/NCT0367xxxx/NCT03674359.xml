    <textblock>
      Systematic and repeated dosing (3 times weekly) of 1,3-β-D-glucan (BDG), associated with&#xD;
      blood cultures and fungal mapping (twice a week) for the patients hospitalized in intensive&#xD;
      care. The diagnosis of candidemia is defined as the 1st positive blood culture for Candida&#xD;
      spp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage of BDG will be considered positive if the value is at least or equal to 80 pg/ml.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The candidemia is the 3rd cause of sepsis in intensive care unit and a serious problem&#xD;
      because the high mortality remains (&gt; 50%) despite the new treatments by echinocandins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A single positive blood culture is sufficient for diagnosis, but the sensitivity of blood&#xD;
      cultures is only 50 to 70 percent. Clinical signs are unspecific and do not guide the&#xD;
      diagnosis. If treatment started early, 12 hours after the 1st positive blood culture&#xD;
      collection the mortality is 10%. Recently, the incidence of candidemia in intensive care unit&#xD;
      has increased in France as in other countries as. From these different elements (frequency,&#xD;
      mortality, early diagnosis, little specific clinical signs), it is easy to understand the&#xD;
      approach that has prevailed for many years, which is to define the profile of the patients at&#xD;
      risk of candidemia in intensive care unit. Currently, there are several predictive factors of&#xD;
      occurrence of a candidemia in intensive care unit. They are represented by the index of&#xD;
      colonization, very high risk factors (FTHR) and Candida score (CS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Predictive factors of occurrence of candidemia have led to the concept of preemptive or&#xD;
      empirical treatment, the aim is to being avoid the occurrence of candidemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, the ability of these factors to predict the occurrence of a candidemia is not&#xD;
      satisfactory, explaining in part the mortality rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the light of current knowledge, including the predictive factors of occurrence of&#xD;
      candidemia in intensive care patients, a better selection of patients likely to develop&#xD;
      candidemia remains to this day, a crucial issue. Several teams have been interested in the&#xD;
      evaluation of various bio-markers, including the (1,3) - β - D-glucan (BDG), to optimize&#xD;
      decision-making in intensive care patients at risk of candidemia in front of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the increased frequency of candidemia,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  poorly discriminating predictive factors,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  no specific clinical signs,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  the low sensitivity of blood culture,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  and the impact of early treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To clarify the role of BDG as a predictive factor of candidemia, all patients hospitalized in&#xD;
      intensive care unit, meeting the criteria for inclusion and exclusion, will be followed, from&#xD;
      day 4 of hospitalization or from the beginning of antifungal treatment between the admission&#xD;
      in intensive care unit and day 4, until the exit of intensive care unit or until day30 of&#xD;
      hospitalization in intensive care unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dosage of BDG and blood cultures will be performed on day 4 of hospitalization or before&#xD;
      the beginning of antifungal treatment between the admission in intensive care unit and the&#xD;
      4th day, then 3 times a week, until day 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A before the beginning of antifungal treatment between the admission to intensive care unit&#xD;
      and the 4th day of hospitalization, then twice a week, maximum until day30.&#xD;
