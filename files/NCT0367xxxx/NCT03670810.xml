    <measure>Change From Baseline in Total Score as Measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS) Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>The MIDAS is a participant-rated scale which was designed to quantify headache-related disability over a 3-month period. This instrument consists of 5 items that reflect the number of days reported as missed, or with reduced productivity at work or home and social events. Each question is answered as the number of days during the past 3 months of assessment, ranging from 0 to 90, with the total score being the summation of the 5 numeric responses. A higher value is indicative of more disability.</description>

    <measure>Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQoLQ) Score at 24 Hours Post First Dose of Study During First Attack</measure>
    <time_frame>24 Hours Post First Dose</time_frame>
    <description>The 24-hour Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire (24-hr MQoLQ) has been specifically developed to measure the HRQoL of participants with migraine within a 24-hour period after having taken migraine medication A domain score is calculated by summing the responses to the 3 questions and the domain score ranges from 3 to 21, with lower scores indicating less impairment. The questionnaire will be administered 24 hours after dosing with study drug during each migraine. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used with region and treatment adjusted for the overall treatment effect.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Satisfied With Their Treatment Measured by a 4-Item Questionnaire</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 16</time_frame>
    <description>Treatment satisfaction was evaluated at the End of Study (EoS) visit by determining the participant's level of satisfaction (ranging from extremely dissatisfied to extremely satisfied); their willingness to take this treatment again (ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree) and if they would they recommend this treatment to another participants (ranging from strongly disagree to strongly agree).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Utility at 24 Hours Postdose as Measured by the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) at 24 Hours Postdose During First Attack</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 24 Hours Postdose</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a participant-rated scale that assesses health status, it consists of 2 parts. The first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 5 possible levels of response (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems).The EQ-5D can be used to generate a health state index score, which is used to compute quality-adjusted life years for utilization in health economic analyses. The health state index score is calculated based on the responses to the 5 dimensions, providing a single value on a scale from less than 0 (where 0 is a health state equivalent to death) to 1 (perfect health), with higher scores indicating better health utility. ANCOVA was used to assess the effect of Lasmiditan over placebo or control. The model includes fixed categorical effect of treatment and geographic region and baseline as covariate.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants With Pain Relief at 2 Hours Postdose in at Least 2 Out of 3 Attacks</title>
        <description>Headache pain relief is defined as a reduction in pain severity from moderate to severe at baseline to mild or none at 2 hours postdose in at least 2 out of 3 attacks. To evaluate at least 2 out of 3 consistency endpoints, the results of ITT-evaluable attacks in the lasmiditan 100-mg and 200-mg groups will be assessed, and the ITT-evaluable attacks treated with placebo in the control group will be used for comparison. For participants with more than 3 ITT-evaluable attacks, only the first 3 with the same treatment will be considered.</description>

        <description>Pain-free is defined as mild, moderate, or severe headache pain becoming none at 2 hours postdose during the first attack. A triptan insufficient responder is defined as having one of the following: 1) Scoring ≤5 on 4 questions from the Migraine Treatment Optimization Questionnaire (mTOQ-6) that defines participants with poor or very poor response to their current regimen; 2) Indicated they obtained pain freedom at 2 hours in 0 out of 3, or 1 out of 3 attacks when treated with the most recent triptan, or 3) are not currently taking triptan and discontinued their most recent triptan due to lack of efficacy, tolerability issue, or contradictions to a past triptan.</description>

A triptan insufficient responder is defined as having one of the following: 1) Scoring ≤5 on 4 questions from the Migraine Treatment Optimization Questionnaire (mTOQ-6) that defines participants with poor or very poor response to their current regimen; 2) Indicated they obtained pain freedom at 2 hours in 0 out of 3, or 1 out of 3 attacks when treated with the most recent triptan, or 3) are not currently taking triptan and discontinued their most recent triptan due to lack of efficacy, tolerability issue, or contradictions to a past triptan.</description>
          <population>All randomized participants who were triptan insufficient responders and used at least 1 dose of study drug for an ITT evaluable attack, defined as a treated attack of at least mild pain severity with any postdose pain severity assessments at or before 2 hours postdose.</population>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Total Score as Measured by the Migraine Disability Assessment Test (MIDAS) Scale</title>
        <description>The MIDAS is a participant-rated scale which was designed to quantify headache-related disability over a 3-month period. This instrument consists of 5 items that reflect the number of days reported as missed, or with reduced productivity at work or home and social events. Each question is answered as the number of days during the past 3 months of assessment, ranging from 0 to 90, with the total score being the summation of the 5 numeric responses. A higher value is indicative of more disability.</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Very Much or Much Better as Measured by Patient Global Impression of Change (PGI-C), at 2 Hours Postdose During the First Attack</title>
        <description>The PGI-C is a one-item questionnaire that asks participants to provide their impression of change since taking the medicine. The PGI-C is measured using a 7-point Likert scale, with 1 = very much better, 2 = much better, 3 = a little better, 4 = no change, 5 = a little worse, 6 = much worse, and 7 = very much worse. Reported are participants whose combined impression of change since taking the medicine was very much better and much better at 2 hours postdose.</description>
        <time_frame>2 Hours Postdose</time_frame>
        <population>All randomized participants who used at least 1 dose of study drug for an ITT evaluable attack, defined as a treated attack of at least mild pain severity with any postdose pain severity assessments at or before 2 hours postdose.</population>

        <title>Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire (MQoLQ) Score at 24 Hours Post First Dose of Study During First Attack</title>
        <description>The 24-hour Migraine Quality of Life Questionnaire (24-hr MQoLQ) has been specifically developed to measure the HRQoL of participants with migraine within a 24-hour period after having taken migraine medication A domain score is calculated by summing the responses to the 3 questions and the domain score ranges from 3 to 21, with lower scores indicating less impairment. The questionnaire will be administered 24 hours after dosing with study drug during each migraine. The analysis of variance (ANOVA) model was used with region and treatment adjusted for the overall treatment effect.</description>

        <title>Change From Baseline in Utility at 24 Hours Postdose as Measured by the EuroQol 5-Dimension 5-Level Scale (EQ-5D-5L) at 24 Hours Postdose During First Attack</title>
        <description>The EQ-5D-5L questionnaire is a participant-rated scale that assesses health status, it consists of 2 parts. The first part assesses 5 dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression) that have 5 possible levels of response (no problems, slight problems, moderate problems, severe problems, extreme problems).The EQ-5D can be used to generate a health state index score, which is used to compute quality-adjusted life years for utilization in health economic analyses. The health state index score is calculated based on the responses to the 5 dimensions, providing a single value on a scale from less than 0 (where 0 is a health state equivalent to death) to 1 (perfect health), with higher scores indicating better health utility. ANCOVA was used to assess the effect of Lasmiditan over placebo or control. The model includes fixed categorical effect of treatment and geographic region and baseline as covariate.</description>

        <description>Headache pain-free is defined as a reduction in pain severity from mild, moderate, or severe to none at the indicated assessment time (2 hours postdose). To evaluate 3 out of 4 consistency endpoints; all ITT-evaluable attacks will be used. For the control group, the results of all ITT-evaluable attacks treated with lasmiditan 50 mg or placebo will be included. The control group is used for comparison.
