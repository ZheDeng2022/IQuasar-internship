    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of&#xD;
      intravenous mosunetuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin in participants with&#xD;
      diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) and in participants with follicular lymphoma (FL). It&#xD;
      will consist of a dose finding portion followed by an expansion phase for second line or&#xD;
      later (2L+) participants with relapsed or refractory (R/R) DLBCL and 2L+ R/R FL. In addition,&#xD;
      subcutaneous mosunetuzumab in combination with polatuzumab vedotin will be evaluated in&#xD;
      participants with at least 2 prior lines of systemic therapy for the treatment of R/R mantle&#xD;
      cell lymphoma (MCL).&#xD;
