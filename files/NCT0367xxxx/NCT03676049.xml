  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a treatment study under an approved Expanded Use IND protocol for using Cannabidiol&#xD;
      (CBD) Extract. CBD will be used for the treatment of 5-10 children with drug resistant&#xD;
      epilepsy. The CBD used in this study is prepared at the University of Mississippi under&#xD;
      approval of the National Institute on Drug Abuse (NIDA) for its preparation and FDA approval&#xD;
      under an expanded access mechanism on a compassionate use basis. The target patient&#xD;
      population is who would otherwise have no appropriate remaining treatment modality left.&#xD;
      These are patients for whom the risks of a relatively untested product are outweighed by the&#xD;
      potential benefit. Using seizure-diaries to register seizure frequency, drug log and&#xD;
      questionnaire to measure parent/patient quality of life and side effects will be assessed in&#xD;
      each visit. Visits are: baseline, 4, 8, and 12 weeks visit. A 24 weeks visit (6 months) will&#xD;
      be performed if the patient is stable on therapy during the 3 initial months and want to&#xD;
      continue on the study for 3 more months. CBD will be administered as an adjunct to all&#xD;
      current anti-epileptic therapies.&#xD;

      Expanded Access Use: Restrictions to those with most significant epilepsy severity and&#xD;
      especially neurocognitive delays (to minimize side effect profiles) remain in place. Study&#xD;
      design, hover, is targeted at an Expanded Access use of product for children who would&#xD;
      otherwise have no appropriate remaining treatment modality left.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Timeline: 3 months with the option to continue for up to 3 months of follow up therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Five to ten (5-10) refractory epilepsy patients, aged 5-19 years old, all&#xD;
      sexes, who must have failed at least 3 appropriate drugs, +/- vagal nerve stimulator, +/-&#xD;
      dietary therapy, +/- resective surgery will be provided CBD as part of the Principal&#xD;
      Investigator's Physician Expanded Access IND.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Written parental permission obtained from the patient's parent or legal representative must&#xD;
      be obtained prior to beginning treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug administration: CBD will be administered as an adjunct to all current antiepileptic&#xD;
      drugs. A dosing titration period will start with 100 mg/day, with 50mg BID dosing, and will&#xD;
      be titrated monthly as tolerated based on clinical response, up to 300mg/day. This is based&#xD;
      on a targeted dosing of 2.5---5---7.5 mg/kg/d. Any patients under 40kg will have adjusted&#xD;
      dosing based on weight as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 40 kg and up:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 ml BID, escalating to 2 ml BID, and then 3 ml BID&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 30 - 39 kg:&#xD;
&#xD;
      0.75 ml BID, escalating to 1.5 and 2.25 ml BID&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 20 - 29 kg 0.5 ml BID, escalating to 1 and 1.5 ml BID&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical evaluations: All subjects will be clinically evaluated at baseline, once a month for&#xD;
      the three months of titration period and during the three months of follow up period. During&#xD;
      the first week of the study drug initiation, patients will be called at day 3 and then at day&#xD;
      7 to review any changes in condition. Subsequently, patients will receive a phone call weekly&#xD;
      and will be evaluated in their physician study visits during the titration period to review&#xD;
      any changes in condition and determine whether an increase in dosing is required. The&#xD;
      investigator will be available by telephone throughout the 3 months of the titration period&#xD;
      of the study, in between the visits and throughout the 3 months in the follow up period.&#xD;
      Patients will receive the CBD during their monthly study visits during the titration and&#xD;
      follow up period. The first dose of CBD will be administered by the physician in the&#xD;
      Pediatric Clinical Research Clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pregnant patients will be excluded from the study. Female patients of childbearing potential&#xD;
      will be screened for pregnancy prior to enrollment, and during the study if a potential for&#xD;
      pregnancy arise. A -blood pregnancy test will be used. Therefore, parent/guardian of female&#xD;
      subjects must tell the investigator and consult an obstetrician or maternal-fetal specialist&#xD;
      if the child become pregnant during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Between 1-3 baseline anti-epileptic drugs at stable doses for a minimum of 4 weeks&#xD;
             prior to enrollment. Vagus nerve stimulator, and dietary therapies do not count toward&#xD;
