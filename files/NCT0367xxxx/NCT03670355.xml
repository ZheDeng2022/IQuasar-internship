    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetics (PK) and safety of a 90-day intravaginal ring&#xD;
      (IVR) containing tenofovir (TFV) in healthy, HIV-uninfected individuals assigned female sex&#xD;
      at birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive an IVR containing either 1.4 g TFV or&#xD;
      placebo. The IVR will be inserted at the enrollment visit (Day 0) and used continuously for&#xD;
      approximately 91 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional study visits will occur at Days 1, 7, 14, 28, 42, 56, 91, and 92. Study visits may&#xD;
      include behavioral assessments, physical examinations, blood and urine collection, and pelvic&#xD;
      and rectal specimen collection.&#xD;

             procedures (SOPs)&#xD;

             days (inclusive) prior to Enrollment, and intending to continue use of an effective&#xD;

                  levonorgestrel-releasing IUD) nor to participants using continuous combination&#xD;
                  oral contraceptive pills, as the absence of regular menstrual cycles is an&#xD;

             period&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: A documented negative pregnancy test performed by study staff is required&#xD;
                  for inclusion; however, a self-reported pregnancy is adequate for exclusion from&#xD;
                  the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosed with symptomatic urinary tract infection (UTI) or reproductive tract&#xD;
             infection (RTI) at Screening or Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Otherwise eligible participants diagnosed with UTI/RTI during screening will be&#xD;
                  offered treatment. If treatment is complete and symptoms have resolved within the&#xD;
                  45 day screening window, eligible participants may be enrolled.&#xD;

               -  Note: Genital warts requiring treatment and frequent recurrence of HSV are&#xD;
                  considered exclusionary; however, infrequent HSV outbreaks are not. Genital warts&#xD;
                  requiring treatment are defined as those that cause undue burden or discomfort to&#xD;
                  the participant, including bulky size, unacceptable appearance, or physical&#xD;
                  discomfort. See MTN-038 Study-Specific Procedures (SSP) Manual for additional&#xD;
                  information.&#xD;

                  collection judged to be within the range of normal according to the clinical&#xD;
                  judgment of the IoR/designee is considered expected non-menstrual bleeding and is&#xD;
                  not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with exclusionary pelvic exam findings may&#xD;
                  be enrolled/randomized after the findings have improved to a non-exclusionary&#xD;
                  severity grading or resolved within 45 days of providing informed consent for&#xD;
                  screening.&#xD;

                  piercing) 45 days or less prior to Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Note: Colposcopy and cervical biopsies for evaluation of an abnormal Pap&#xD;
                       test as well as IUD insertion/removal are not exclusionary.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Currently breastfeeding or planning to breastfeed during the study&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Participation in any other research study involving drugs, medical devices,&#xD;
                  vaginal or rectal products, or vaccines, in the 60 days prior to Enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;

                    -  Note: Otherwise eligible participants with an exclusionary laboratory result&#xD;
                       may be re-tested during the screening process. If a participant is re-tested&#xD;
                       and a non-exclusionary result is documented within 45 days of providing&#xD;
                       informed consent for screening, the participant may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Has any other condition that, in the opinion of the IoR/designee, would preclude&#xD;
             informed consent, make study participation unsafe, complicate the interpretation of&#xD;
             study outcome data, or otherwise interfere with achieving the study objectives&#xD;
             including any significant uncontrolled active or chronic medical condition.&#xD;
