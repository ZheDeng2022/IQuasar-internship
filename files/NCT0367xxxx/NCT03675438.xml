      The objective of this clinical study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      subepithelial implantation of the Allotex TransForm corneal allograft (TCA) for improving&#xD;
      near vision in presbyopic subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Beginning in 1949 with the pioneering work of Jose Barraquer, there has been an interest in&#xD;
      using natural corneal tissue to change the refractive properties of the eye. In recent years,&#xD;
      non-allogenic, synthetic corneal implants have received marketing approval in the United&#xD;
      Stated and Europe for refractive purposes. Although synthetic implants are made of&#xD;
      biocompatible materials they are not equivalent to an allogenic implant in terms of&#xD;
      biocompatibility. The Allotex TCA is a piece of acellular cornea, sterilized with electron&#xD;
      beam radiation and shaped to a particular shape using a laser. The availability of precise&#xD;
      laser shaping systems and sterile corneas are the key factors that make the use of allogenic&#xD;
      implants possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The TCA is applied to the surface of Bowman's membrane just underneath the epithelium. The&#xD;
      goal is to enhance the visual performance of the patient with a material that is 100%&#xD;
      biocompatible and precisely shaped for the individual's needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must be presbyopic adults, needing from +1.75 D to +3.50 D of reading add in the&#xD;
      non-dominant eye and must have uncorrected near visual acuity worse than 20/40 in the&#xD;
      non-dominant eye. Bilateral treatments will not be allowed during this study.&#xD;
