  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This pilot phase I trial studies how well itacitinib works in treating patients with sarcomas&#xD;
      that do not respond to treatment (refractory) and have spread to other parts of the body&#xD;
      (advanced/metastatic). Itacitinib may cause changes in the immune system and the body's&#xD;
      immune response to cancer, which may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the&#xD;
      enzymes needed for cell growth.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive itacitinib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-28. Cycles repeat every 28&#xD;
      days in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 7 and 30 days, every 12&#xD;
      weeks from baseline for up to 1 year, and then every 6 months thereafter.&#xD;
