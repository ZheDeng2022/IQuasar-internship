  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is a certain group of patients that has chronic rhinosinusitis that has continued even&#xD;
      with treatment including saline and steroid nasal irrigations as well as oral steroids and&#xD;
      antibiotics and surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In these patients, the use of topical antibiotic nasal rinses may be of benefit to their&#xD;
      disease. The use of topical antibiotic nasal rinses is commonly used as standard of care&#xD;
      already throughout the country for refractory chronic rhinosinusitis including here at the&#xD;
      Mayo Clinic. Our pharmacy has compounded this medication for this specific purpose. As such,&#xD;
      this study is not aimed at a 'novel medication', but rather to investigate the efficacy of a&#xD;
      medication already in common use but without great evidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are doing this research study to find out if patients develop antibiotic&#xD;
      resistant organisms after the use of topical antibiotics in the treatment of chronic&#xD;
      rhinosinusitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, this study will look at the effects of topical antibiotics on patient symptoms&#xD;
      as measured by a patient survey called the Sino-Nasal Outcomes Test (SNOT-22) and in-office&#xD;
      an exam of the inside of their nose, including with a scope (a camera on the end of a long&#xD;
      tube).&#xD;
