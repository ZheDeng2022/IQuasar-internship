  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators will enroll a total of 628 patients under 18 years of age with ARP or CP.&#xD;
      Included in the total are the 357patients in the INSPPIRE 1 database who are planned to be&#xD;
      reenrolled under this protocol over the next 4 years. Patient questionnaires and physician&#xD;
      surveys will be applied at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter as long as&#xD;
      possible. At the first study visit after turning 18 years of age, the patient will sign the&#xD;
      informed consent to continue in the study. Specifically, the investigators will define the&#xD;
      demographics of the pediatric ARP and CP cohort, describe risk factors, presence of family&#xD;
      history of acute and chronic pancreatitis, diabetes and pancreatic cancer and assess disease&#xD;
      burden and sequelae.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disease Burden Pain. The pattern of the pain (constant versus episodic), its frequency,&#xD;
      duration, visits to the emergency room or hospitalizations for pain, impact of pain on&#xD;
      quality of life will be recorded in questionnaires. The intensity of the pain will be&#xD;
      measured at enrollment, during an attack and annually using FACES Pain Scale-Revised, a&#xD;
      self-report questionnaire validated for children &gt;4 y/o. The names, dosing and frequency of&#xD;
      medications taken for pain will also be queried.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQOL). An age-specific instrument validated for United&#xD;
      States children will be used to measure HRQOL at enrollment and annually thereafter. Parents&#xD;
      of children 5-18 years old will complete Child Health Questionnaire Parent Form 50 questions&#xD;
      (CHQ PF-50). Children &gt;10 years old will answer Child Health Questionnaire Child Form 87&#xD;
      questions (CHQ-87). Adults &gt;18 years old will not complete a health-related questionnaire.&#xD;
      These questionnaires capture physical functioning, social, emotional, physical and behavioral&#xD;
      limitations, bodily pain, general behavior, mental health, self-esteem, general health&#xD;
      perceptions, change in health and parental emotional impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression and anxiety. Depression and anxiety are strong predictors of chronic pain and&#xD;
      pain-related disability in children, but it is not known whether this applies to children&#xD;
      with ARP or CP. The investigators will assess for depression and anxiety in the INSPPIRE&#xD;
      cohort at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter. The investigators will utilize the&#xD;
      Child Behavioral Checklist (CBCL), one of the most widely-used standardized measures in child&#xD;
      psychology for evaluating maladaptive behavioral and emotional problems in preschool subjects&#xD;
      aged 1½ to 5 years and in school-age subjects between the ages of 6 and 18. For preschool-age&#xD;
      children, the CBCL/1½-5 (completed by parents or surrogates) will be used. For school-age&#xD;
      children 6-18 y/o, the investigators will utilize CBCL/6-18 y/o (completed by parents or&#xD;
      surrogates). Children who are 11-18 y/o will answer a self-report questionnaire (Youth-Self&#xD;
      Report Form or YSR/11-18). CBCL assesses internalizing (i.e., anxious, depressive, and over&#xD;
      controlled) and externalizing (i.e., aggressive, hyperactive, noncompliant, and&#xD;
      undercontrolled) behaviors. Adults &gt;18 years old will not complete a behavioral checklist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients/parents will spend approximately 2 hours answering questionnaires; their time will&#xD;
      be compensated at $50 per visit. Patients will be enrolled during clinic visit as outpatient&#xD;
      or as an inpatient. Alternatively, questionnaires can be applied over the phone or completed&#xD;
      at home and returned via mail if the patient is unable to travel. Self-addressed stamped&#xD;
      envelopes will be given to the patient/parent as needed for returning the questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disease Sequelae&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence of exocrine pancreatic insufficiency and glucose intolerance/diabetes will be&#xD;
      monitored at the time of enrollment and annually thereafter. Monitoring will include&#xD;
      specifically:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exocrine pancreatic insufficiency: defined as the presence of abnormal fecal elastase (&lt;&#xD;
           100 ug/ g stool on 2 separate samples ≥ 1 month apart) or abnormal serum trypsin or&#xD;
           serum trypsinogen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Diabetes or prediabetes: Monitoring for diabetes in our cohort will include once yearly&#xD;
           assessments with fasting glucose (diabetes range if ≥ 126 mg/dL), HbA1c (abnormal if &gt;6;&#xD;
           diabetic if &gt;6.5%) and oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT). For OGTT, 1.75 grams/kg of&#xD;
           standard glucose beverage (glucola, maximum 75 grams) will be consumed within 10 minutes&#xD;
           at time 0. Glucose will be drawn prior to the beverage and at time 120 minutes. From&#xD;
           this test, glycemic status will be defined as: (1) normal glucose tolerance (NGT,&#xD;
           fasting glucose &lt;100 mg/dL, 2 hour &lt;140 mg/dL); (2) pre-diabetic based on impaired&#xD;
           fasting glucose (IFG, fasting glucose 100-125 mg/dL) and/or impaired glucose tolerance&#xD;
           (IGT, 2 hour glucose 140-199 mg/dL); or (3) diabetic (DM, fasting glucose &gt;126 mg/dL or&#xD;
           2 hour glucose &gt;200 mg/dL).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Nutritional status including micronutrient deficiency: To determine the nutritional&#xD;
           sequelae of ARP or CP in children, the investigators will assess for&#xD;
           malnutrition/obesity (weight, height, BMI, z scores; body fat mass and lean mass as&#xD;
           measured by DXA scan), fat soluble vitamin deficiencies (serum vitamin levels for A, D,&#xD;
           and E and bone density (DXA scan) in children with ARP or CP at the time of enrollment&#xD;
           and annually thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will identify subjects within our cohort that presented with acute&#xD;
      recurrent pancreatitis episodes, normal exocrine and endocrine pancreas function and normal&#xD;
      pancreas imaging without any signs of chronicity (ARP cohort). The investigators will&#xD;
      identify the development of CP on an annual basis as long as possible, as well as development&#xD;
      of sequelae and disease burden as listed above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective Registry&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will develop a database of children with ARP and CP. This will provide a&#xD;
      cohort of well-phenotyped subjects for future studies targeting pathogenesis and novel&#xD;
      therapies. The investigators will establish a process by which investigators outside of the&#xD;
      consortium may have access to the data and biospecimens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At enrollment, via the informed consent, subjects will choose whether or not to allow use of&#xD;
      their biological samples for this study, future research, genetic analysis, genetic analysis&#xD;
      for future research, and any type of future research. They will also choose whether or not we&#xD;
      may keep their name and personal information in a registry to allow us to contact them for&#xD;
      other future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BIOSPECIMEN COLLECTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample collection for deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA): The subject will be able to give either&#xD;
      blood or saliva. Six ml of blood will be collected from subjects in an&#xD;
      ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid tube or 2 ml saliva samples in Oragene DNA collection kits&#xD;
      then labeled with the barcoded specimen labels provided by the Consortium for the Study of&#xD;
      Chronic Pancreatitis, Diabetes, and Pancreatic Cancer (CPDPC) Coordinating Center. The&#xD;
      specimen labels provided by CPDPC include a specimen identification (ID) number and barcode.&#xD;
      Subject identifiers (for example names or initials) are not included on the labels. Before&#xD;
      shipping the specimens to the central repository the specimen ID number from the label will&#xD;
      be connected to the patient information in the CPDPC's secure IIMS Specimen Manager system.&#xD;
      After the specimen ID number is linked to the subject in the CPDPC system the samples will be&#xD;
      submitted to the central repository for the study via overnight courier. The central&#xD;
      repository for DNA will be at the University of Iowa. The central repository at Iowa will not&#xD;
      have access to the link that connects to the patient's personal identifiers in the Integrated&#xD;
      Information Management System (IIMS). The central repository will log receipt of the&#xD;
      specimens into the CPDPC IIMS Specimen Manager system using the specimen ID from the labeled&#xD;
      vials. The central repository will process the specimens into aliquots for the extraction of&#xD;
      genomic DNA following the CPDPC specimen processing described in the appendices. The aliquots&#xD;
      will be labeled with CPDPC supplied labels and stored in a freezer at -80 degree Centigrade.&#xD;
      The CPDPC aliquots labels contain barcodes and specimen ID numbers that do not link the&#xD;
      aliquots to each other. The only link to the subject information resides in the secured&#xD;
      database at the CPDPC coordinating and data management center. The central repository&#xD;
      laboratory staff and the study researchers do not have access to this link. At the end of the&#xD;
      study the specimens stored in the central repository at Iowa will be transferred to a central&#xD;
      repository at National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Urine collection for bio-markers: To be completed only at sites identified by the lead site&#xD;
      to collect urine samples. Not all sites will be collecting urine. See Appendix 14.27 for&#xD;
      collection and processing instructions. The subject will be instructed to collect a minimum&#xD;
      of 50 mL clean-catch urine sample. A dipstick urine analysis will be performed immediately&#xD;
      after urine collection. Urine samples will then be kept on wet ice or refrigerated until&#xD;
      processed. Samples will be processed within 4 hours of collection. Samples will be labeled&#xD;
      with the barcoded specimen labels provided by the CPDPC Coordinating Center. The specimen&#xD;
      labels provided by CPDPC include a specimen ID number and barcode. Subject identifiers (for&#xD;
      example names or initials) are not included on the labels. Before shipping the specimens to&#xD;
      the central repository the specimen ID number from the label will be connected to the subject&#xD;
      information in the CPDPC's secure IIMS Specimen Manager system. After processing, samples&#xD;
      will be frozen at -80ºC. The urine processing log sheet will be completed. Samples will be&#xD;
      stored and batch shipped to the Central repository at University of Iowa annually. The&#xD;
      central repository will log receipt of the specimens into the CPDPC IIMs Specimen Manager&#xD;
      system using the specimen ID from the labeled vials. The central repository at University of&#xD;
      Iowa will not have access to the link that connects the subject's personal identifiers in the&#xD;
      IIMS system. The central repository will log receipt of the specimens into the CPDPC IIMS&#xD;
      Specimen Manager system using the specimen ID from the labeled vials. The CPDPC aliquots&#xD;
      labels contain barcodes and specimen ID numbers that do not link the aliquots to each other.&#xD;
      The only link to the subject information resides in the secured database at the CPDPC&#xD;
      coordinating and data management center. The central repository laboratory staff and the&#xD;
      study researchers do not have access to this link. At the end of the study the specimens&#xD;
      stored in the central repository at Iowa will be transferred to a central repository at&#xD;
      NIDDK.&#xD;
