  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are obese, as defined by a BMI ≥ 30 kg/m2 may be more difficult to intubate than&#xD;
      non-obese patients. Traditional methods of airway assessment such as Mallampati score, mouth&#xD;
      opening, and thyromental distance may not be the best predictors of difficult intubation.&#xD;
      Patients who are scheduled to have non-stat surgery at Parkland Memorial Hospital will be&#xD;
      asked to participate in this study and sign a written consent form. Physiologic measurements&#xD;
      including but not limited to thyromental distance, sternomental distance, Mallampati score,&#xD;
      mouth opening, interincisor distance, and mandibular protrusion will be measured and&#xD;
      recorded. All measurements are non invasive. The remaining aspects of perioperative care,&#xD;
      including the general anesthetic technique, will be standardized for all patients and will&#xD;
      not differ from the standard of care. There will be no incentive or payment to the patients.&#xD;
      This prospective study is intended to enroll 4500 consecutive surgical patients. Lean&#xD;
      patients (BMI &lt; 30 kg/m2) who are intubated by the same anesthesia providers during the same&#xD;
      time period will be included as the control group and to report the incidence of difficult&#xD;
      mask ventilation and difficult intubation in our general surgical population, which has not&#xD;
      previously been defined.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will enroll 4500 ASA physical status 1-4 patients who are scheduled to undergo&#xD;
      surgery under general endotracheal anesthesia (GETA) at Parkland Hospital. A research&#xD;
      assistant will identify eligible patients using the electronic medical record. After it is&#xD;
      deemed that the patient satisfies all inclusion and exclusion criteria, the anesthesia&#xD;
      provider or research assistant will approach the patient in the preoperative surgery holding&#xD;
      area to ask for their permission to enroll in the study. Only study team personnel will ask&#xD;
      potential patients for participation in the study; anesthesia providers who are not study&#xD;
      team personnel will not be allowed to consent patients for the study. All relevant&#xD;
      information to the study will be provided and the patient will be asked to sign an informed&#xD;
      consent. After consent is obtained, measurements of the patient's anatomical features&#xD;
      including thyromental distance, sternomental distance, neck circumference, interincisor&#xD;
      distance, mandibular protrusion, and Mallampati score will be taken and recorded by the&#xD;
      research assistant or anesthesia provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the operating room, patients will have standard ASA monitors (NIBP, SpO2, EKG, ETCO2,&#xD;
      temperature) placed. Lean patients will be placed in the standard &quot;sniffing&quot; position while&#xD;
      obese patients will be placed in the &quot;ramped&quot; position as previously described. All patients&#xD;
      will undergo pre-oxygenation for at least 3 minutes prior to induction of anesthesia.&#xD;
      Patients will undergo induction of general anesthesia according to a standardized protocol&#xD;
      that does not differ from the usual standard of care. The initial blade used for laryngoscopy&#xD;
      will be selected by the anesthesia provider according to the characteristics of the patient&#xD;
      as has been recommended by previous authors. After induction of general anesthesia, a&#xD;
      research assistant will ask the anesthesia provider the degree of difficulty of mask&#xD;
      ventilation and laryngoscopy using a standardized questionnaire modified from the intubation&#xD;
      difficulty score. For mask ventilation, any adjunct use of equipment such as an oral airway&#xD;
      or nasopharyngeal airway will be recorded. If two-handed ventilation is used, it will be&#xD;
      recorded as well. The type of laryngoscope blade and Cormack-Lehane grade during laryngoscopy&#xD;
      will be recorded. The level of training of the laryngoscopist (resident vs CRNAs vs faculty)&#xD;
      and how many years they have been in that role will be recorded. The time from induction to&#xD;
      intubation will also be recorded, based on the time those events are marked in the electronic&#xD;
      medical record, as well as the lowest SpO2 that occurred between induction to intubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intubation difficulty scale (IDS), which has previously been validated, will be used to&#xD;
      score the intubation. This scale has been used in comparing difficult tracheal intubation in&#xD;
      lean vs. obese patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IDS will be comprised of 7 questions with numerical values for each question, resulting&#xD;
      in a cumulative score. Those with an IDS score &lt;5 will be considered &quot;not difficult&quot; and&#xD;
      those with an IDS score ≥5 will be considered &quot;difficult.&quot; A &quot;failed intubation&quot; will be&#xD;
      defined as that in which the airway cannot be secured in a non-invasive fashion (e.g.,&#xD;
      cricothyrotomy) or the patient has to be awakened. The 7 questioned used to determine the IDS&#xD;
      score will be the same as those used by Adnet et al:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of additional intubation attempts&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Number of additional operators&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Number of alternative intubation techniques used&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Laryngoscopic view (Grade 1 = 0, Grade 2 = 1, Grade 3 = 2, Grade 4 = 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Cormack Lehane grades [13]:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 1- vocal cords completely visible&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 2- arytenoids visible but cords not completely visible&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 3- only epiglottis visible&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Grade 4- epiglottis not visible&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Lifting force applied during laryngoscopy (0 if inconsiderable and 1 if considerable&#xD;
           force used)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. External laryngeal pressure applied for optimized glottic exposure (0 if no, 1 if yes)&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Position of vocal cords at intubation (0 if abducted or not visible, 1 if adducted)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Protected patient information including name, medical record number, and date of birth will&#xD;
      be recorded. Demographic data such as height, weight, BMI, race, and gender will also be&#xD;
      recorded. All patients will receive a standardized general anesthetic that is usual and&#xD;
      customary for patients undergoing their scheduled operation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional information gathered will include ASA status, presence of comorbidities (e.g, OSA,&#xD;
      HTN, DM), thyromental distance, sternomental distance, ability to protrude mandibular teeth&#xD;
      over maxillary teeth, interincisor distance, ability to have full range of motion of the&#xD;
      neck, Mallampati score, and neck circumference.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neck circumference will be measured at the level of the cricoid cartilage with the&#xD;
           patient's neck in neutral position.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Thyromental distance is thought to be an indicator of mandibular space. It will be&#xD;
           measured as the distance from the prominentia laryngea of the thyroid cartilage to the&#xD;
           symphysis of the mandible with the patient in maximum neck extension with the mouth&#xD;
           closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sternomental distance will be measured as the distance from the sternal notch to the&#xD;
           symphysis of the mandible with the patient in maximum neck extension with the mouth&#xD;
           closed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mallampati status will be obtained with the patient in an upright sitting position with&#xD;
           the head in neutral position. Patients will be asked to open their mouth as wide as&#xD;
           possible with tongue protrusion without phonation. Pharyngeal structures will be assess&#xD;
           and classification will be performed according to the structures seen (Class 1 = soft&#xD;
           palate, fauces, uvula, tonsillar pillars; Class 2 = soft palate, fauces, uvula; Class 3&#xD;
           = soft palate, base of uvula only; Class 4 = soft palate not visible).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The ability of the patient to protrude their lower teeth over their upper lip (upper lip&#xD;
           bite test) will be assessed. Class 1 = lower incisors can bite the upper lip above the&#xD;
           vermilion line; Class 2 = lower incisors can bite the upper lip below the vermilion&#xD;
           line; Class 3 = lower incisors cannot bite the upper lip [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Neck range of motion will be graded on a binary scale. Those will full range of motion&#xD;
           in flexion and extension will be graded as full and those without full range of motion&#xD;
           will be graded as limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Interincisor distance will be measured as the maximum distance between the central&#xD;
           incisors (teeth 9 and 24 or teeth 8 and 25). Patients who are edentulous will have their&#xD;
           gum-to-gum distance recorded as the interincisor distance.&#xD;
