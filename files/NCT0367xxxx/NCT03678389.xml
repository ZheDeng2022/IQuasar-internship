      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pituitary tumors can cause problems by secreting hormones in the body. They can also problems&#xD;
      by growing large and pushing on organs near the pituitary gland. The best treatment for such&#xD;
      tumors is to remove them by surgery. But that may be sometimes difficult. Some tumors maybe&#xD;
      too small to see. Some other tumors maybe so large that portions maybe left behind during&#xD;
      surgery. The endosphenoidal coil (ESC) is a new magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) device. It&#xD;
      fits in a small space made during surgery near the pituitary. Researchers want to see if it&#xD;
      helps transmit MRI signals during surgery to make better images of the pituitary gland and&#xD;
      tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To test the safety of using a new coil device to improve MRI imaging of pituitary tumors&#xD;
      during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adults 18-65 years old who are having pituitary tumor surgery at NIH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Review of prior brain scans&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and pregnancy tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have MRI of pituitary gland. They will lie on a table that slides into&#xD;
      a metal cylinder in a strong magnetic field. They will lie still and get earplugs for loud&#xD;
      sounds. A dye will be inserted into an arm vein by needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will stay in the hospital for about 1 week. They will repeat screening tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have standard pituitary surgery. They will get medicine to go to sleep. The&#xD;
      surgeon will create a path to the pituitary gland from under the lip.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During surgery, the ESC will be placed through the path to near the pituitary. Then an MRI&#xD;
      will be done during surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then the ESC will be removed and standard surgery will continue.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get standard post-operative care under another protocol.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Tumors of the pituitary gland comprise up to 20% of all brain tumors. The central location&#xD;
      and the small size of the pituitary gland make the management of tumors particularly&#xD;
      challenging. Transsphenoidal surgery (TSS) to resect pituitary tumors is highly successful at&#xD;
      achieving complete cure for functional pituitary adenomas. It is most successful when such&#xD;
      adenomas can be localized by preoperative MRI of the pituitary. However, in some instances,&#xD;
      small functional tumors cannot be visualized. In the case of Cushing s disease (CD), such&#xD;
      non-visualization may be as high as 50%. The success of transsphenoidal surgery is&#xD;
      substantially reduced in patients with negative MRI, as some of the adenomas that cause CD&#xD;
      are so small that they are difficult to find during surgical exploration of the pituitary.&#xD;
      Surgical success is also diminished when tumors invade the walls of the cavernous sinus. MRI&#xD;
      of the pituitary lacks imaging resolution to detect such invasion and so the surgeon cannot&#xD;
      perform a complete resection with surgery based on the preoperative MRI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Signal to noise ratio (SNR) is the primary constraint on achieving high quality high&#xD;
      resolution MRI images. SNR can be improved by longer scan times or by increasing the field&#xD;
      strength of the MRI magnet. SNR is proportional to the square of imaging time, however, long&#xD;
      imaging times are not clinically feasible. SNR is linearly proportional to field strength,&#xD;
      however, replacing MRI magnets is cost prohibitive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another strong determinant of SNR is the proximity of the MRI receiver coil to the tissue&#xD;
      being imaged. Placement of a coil in close proximity to the structure of interest&#xD;
      dramatically increases SNR, often as much as 10-fold. Clinically this is routinely put into&#xD;
      practice for superficial body parts, such as the temporomandibular joints, in which small&#xD;
      coils are placed directly over the joints to achieve rapid high-resolution imaging. For deep&#xD;
      structures, the use of superficial coils is of no benefit. This has led to the development of&#xD;
      endocavitary coils, such as the endorectal coil used to image the prostate gland. Such coils&#xD;
      are now in routine clinical use here at the NIH and elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During routine TSS, the surgical approach to the pituitary provides a route for placement of&#xD;
      imaging tools, such as handheld ultrasound and Doppler probes in close proximity to the&#xD;
      gland. Extending this model to MRI imaging, we realized that an endocavitary surface coil&#xD;
      within the sphenoid sinus will allow for a marked improvement in SNR for imaging the sella.&#xD;
      To this end, we have developed an endosphenoidal coil (ESC), demonstrated its MRI safety, and&#xD;
      performed preliminary studies in cadaver heads to determine that the ESC can be placed&#xD;
      through the transsphenoidal approach. Placement of ESC needs no modification in the surgical&#xD;
      TSS approach to the pituitary gland. The goal of this protocol is to examine the safety and&#xD;
      feasibility of ESC placement and imaging during TSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the feasibility and safety of using ESC during TSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will be up to 20 adult subjects with pituitary tumors that require TSS.&#xD;
      Enrollment will be completed once 10 subjects have received the study procedure. The&#xD;
      requested accrual ceiling of 20 subjects accounts for screening failures and drop-outs who do&#xD;
      not receive the study procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study of 10 subjects requiring TSS for pituitary lesions. The subjects&#xD;
      will undergo standard TSS resection of a pituitary adenoma in the intra-operative MR suite.&#xD;
      Following standard surgical approach, the ESC will be placed into the sphenoid sinus, while&#xD;
      the bone of the sellar floor is still intact. Routine clinical pituitary imaging with and&#xD;
      without intravenous contrast will be performed for comparison with standard pituitary&#xD;
      imaging. Additional higher resolution sequences will be performed as time allows. Following&#xD;
      imaging, standard surgical resection will be performed. Surgeon will not view scans arising&#xD;
      from the research procedure and therefore intraoperative clinical decisions making will not&#xD;
      be influenced by the results of the research imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome of this study is the feasibility of using ESC as a clinical tool during&#xD;
      transsphenoidal surgery. Feasibility will be assessed by the time added to a standard TSS&#xD;
      procedure (measured from the time the TSS exposure is completed to the time to return to the&#xD;
      operating position for completion of surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Outcome Measure&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will evaluate the safety of the ESC as a surgical adjunct tool. We will evaluate whether&#xD;
      the use of ESC causes local trauma, bleeding, burns or other unanticipated safety issues&#xD;
      during TSS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Outcome Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical utility of these images will be evaluated by comparing SNR and contrast to noise&#xD;
      ratio (CNR) measurements obtained with the ESC to preoperative standard of care images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pituitary SNR with ESC MRI versus pre-operative standard of care images.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pituitary to tumor Contrast to Noise Ratio (CNR) with ESC MRI versus pre-operative&#xD;
           standard of care images.&#xD;

        -  INCLUSION CRITIERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Adult subjects (more than 18 years of age) will be included in this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Have a known or suspected tumor of the pituitary gland that requires surgical&#xD;
             resection through a transsphenoidal approach. There is no size restriction. Invasion&#xD;
             of surrounding anatomical structures by the pituitary tumor will not be ground for&#xD;
             screen failure/withdrawal from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Are enrolled in 03-N-0164, Evaluation and Treatment of Neurosurgical Disorders. If not&#xD;
             enrolled, subjects will not be able to be included in the study as clinical and&#xD;
             research procedures are done under the 03-N-0164 protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Are able to provide written consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. NIH employees are included in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITIERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects will be excluded from this study if they:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Are unable to fit the intra-operative MRI table due to size or weight restrictions i.e&#xD;
             morbid obesity. Patients will be anaesthetized and therefore claustrophobia will not&#xD;
             be ground for screen failure/withdrawal from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have an absolute contraindication to MRI imaging or MRI contrast agent according to&#xD;
             Rad&amp;IS screening including devices or conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Have a variant anatomy which may, in the judgment of the operating neurosurgeon, add&#xD;
             unacceptable risk to the placement of the endosphenoidal coil (e.g. small size of&#xD;
             facial bones and nasal passages, unaerated sphenoid sinus etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Are pregnant or nursing.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients older than 65 years of age. Cushing disease is rare in the older population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The Eligibility Checklist is included as an attachment. This checklist is used by the&#xD;
