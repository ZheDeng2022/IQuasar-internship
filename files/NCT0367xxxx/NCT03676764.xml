  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An estimated 7.7 million pre-school aged children die each year, the majority from infectious&#xD;
      diseases. Mass azithromycin distributions for trachoma may have the unintended benefit of&#xD;
      reducing childhood mortality. We recently demonstrated the biannual mass azithromycin&#xD;
      distribution significantly reduces all-cause child mortality in a cluster randomized trial&#xD;
      (MORDOR I) conducted in three diverse regions of Sub-Saharan Africa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to more precisely define the role of mass azithromycin treatments as an&#xD;
      intervention for reducing childhood morbidity and mortality. We propose a cluster randomized&#xD;
      trial designed to repeat the original study to confirm the original results in a different&#xD;
      geographic study with similarly high child mortality, and to better understand the mechanism&#xD;
      behind any effect of azithromycin on child mortality. We hypothesize that biannual mass&#xD;
      azithromycin distribution will reduce child mortality compared to placebo, and that this&#xD;
      effect will be primarily driven by a reduction in infectious burden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the efficacy of biannual mass azithromycin distribution versus placebo in&#xD;
           children aged 1-59 months for reduction in all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the efficacy of targeted azithromycin distribution to infants during an early&#xD;
           infant healthcare visit (approximately 5th through 12th week of life) on infant&#xD;
           mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the mechanism behind the effect of biannual mass azithromycin distribution for&#xD;
           reduction in child mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in the Nouna District in northwestern Burkina Faso.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Although child health and mortality are improving worldwide, children in the Sahel and&#xD;
      sub-Sahel regions of West Africa have the greatest risks of mortality.Burkina Faso's current&#xD;
      under-5 mortality rate is estimated 110 per 1,000 live births. Similar to other countries in&#xD;
      the region, the major causes of child mortality in Burkina Faso are malaria, respiratory&#xD;
      tract infection, and diarrhea. Malnutrition acts as a major underlying contributor to&#xD;
      mortality. Interventions that address these underlying causes may be particularly efficacious&#xD;
      for reducing mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Younger children at are at a higher risk of mortality. Approximately 2/3rd of under-5 deaths&#xD;
      occur during the first year of life. In general, the child mortality rate decreases as age&#xD;
      increases. While some improvement has been observed, neonatal mortality is declining at a&#xD;
      slower rate than post-neonatal childhood mortality. Many child health interventions are&#xD;
      designed specifically for children over 6 months of age, such as vitamin A supplementation,&#xD;
      seasonal malaria chemoprevention, and lipid-based nutritional supplementation. Identification&#xD;
      of strategies that are safe and effective for the youngest children will be required to&#xD;
      address persistently high rates of neonatal and infant mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MORDOR I study demonstrated a significant reduction in all-cause child mortality&#xD;
      following biannual mass azithromycin distribution. Across three diverse geographic locations&#xD;
      in sub-Saharan Africa (Malawi, Niger, and Tanzania), biannual mass azithromycin distribution&#xD;
      over a two-year period led to a 14% decrease in all-cause child mortality. In Niger, 1 in 5-6&#xD;
      deaths were averted. These results are qualitatively similar to those of a previous study of&#xD;
      mass azithromycin distribution for trachoma control in Ethiopia, which found reduced odds of&#xD;
      all-cause mortality in children in communities receiving mass azithromycin compared to&#xD;
      control communities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In MORDOR I, the strongest effect of azithromycin was in the youngest cohort of children.&#xD;
      Across all three countries, the strongest effect of azithromycin was consistently in children&#xD;
      1-5 months of age, with an approximately 25% reduction in all-cause mortality. However,&#xD;
      MORDOR I was not optimized to target the youngest age groups. Although children as young as 1&#xD;
      month were eligible, biannual distributions might not reach some children until 7 months of&#xD;
      age. On average, children were first treated at 4 months. Given that there may be a&#xD;
      substantial benefit to treating children at younger ages, azithromycin strategies that are&#xD;
      designed to target younger age groups may be even more beneficial for reducing child&#xD;
      mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we propose a randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the efficacy of mass and&#xD;
      targeted azithromycin strategies for child mortality. In the rural northwestern district of&#xD;
      Nouna in Burkina Faso, we propose to randomize villages to biannual mass azithromycin&#xD;
      distribution or placebo. This study was designed by CRSN and UCSF partners to confirm the&#xD;
      results of MORDOR I, evaluate an alternative health systems distribution point (the vaccine&#xD;
      visit) for delivery of azithromycin to young children, and to provide a platform for&#xD;
      evaluation of potential mechanisms behind the effect of azithromycin by collecting and&#xD;
      processing additional specimens and tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the efficacy of biannual mass azithromycin distribution versus placebo in&#xD;
           children aged 1-59 months for reduction in all-cause mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the efficacy of targeted azithromycin distribution to infants during an early&#xD;
           infant healthcare visit (approximately 5th through 12th week of life) on infant&#xD;
           mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Determine the mechanism behind the effect of biannual mass azithromycin distribution for&#xD;
           reduction in child mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      CRSN and UCSF (hereafter, &quot;we&quot;) will assess childhood mortality over three years, comparing&#xD;
      communities where children aged 1-59 months receive biannual oral azithromycin and/or&#xD;
      targeted azithromycin during the 5th-12th week of life in conjunction with the first Expanded&#xD;
      Programme on Immunization (EPI) vaccine visit or biannual placebo and targeted placebo. All&#xD;
      eligible communities in Nouna District will be randomized (278 communities). A random sample&#xD;
      of 48 (12/arm) communities from within the HDSS will be selected to participate in the&#xD;
      &quot;Mortality Plus&quot; study, which will entail an annual morbidity exam among 15 randomly selected&#xD;
      children per community to monitor infectious disease morbidity, nutritional status, and&#xD;
      macrolide resistance. All communities will contribute to the mortality outcome.&#xD;
