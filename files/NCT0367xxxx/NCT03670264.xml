  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      More than 90% of adult smokers initiate tobacco use before age 18, making prevention and&#xD;
      treatment of adolescent smoking a critical health priority. Behavioral economic interventions&#xD;
      utilizing financial incentives can promote smoking cessation in adult populations. No studies&#xD;
      have evaluated financial incentives among adolescents to promote engagement in effective&#xD;
      tobacco cessation programs through primary care settings. The goal of this study is to to&#xD;
      compare, through a pilot, randomized controlled trial, an intervention incentivizing contact&#xD;
      with a tobacco cessation program (the Quitline), an intervention incentivizing quitting, or&#xD;
      no financial incentive intervention on adolescent smoker enrollment and depth of engagement&#xD;
      in the tobacco cessation program.&#xD;

      Context:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cigarette smoking remains a leading preventable cause of death in the United States (U.S.)&#xD;
      with substantial morbidity, mortality, and financial costs each year. More than 90% of adult&#xD;
      smokers initiate tobacco use before age 18, making prevention and treatment of adolescent&#xD;
      tobacco use a critical health priority. Further, e-cigarettes are now the most common tobacco&#xD;
      product used by teenagers, and adolescent use of e-cigarettes is strongly associated with&#xD;
      transition to cigarette use. Behavioral economic interventions utilizing financial incentives&#xD;
      can promote smoking cessation in adult populations. No studies have evaluated financial&#xD;
      incentives among adolescents to promote engagement in effective tobacco cessation programs&#xD;
      through primary care settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To compare, through a pilot, randomized controlled trial, an intervention&#xD;
      incentivizing contact with the Quitline, an intervention incentivizing quitting, or no&#xD;
      financial incentive intervention on adolescent enrollment and depth of engagement in a&#xD;
      tobacco cessation program (Free Smoker Quitline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objective: To compare cotinine-confirmed 2-month quit rates across the 3 groups,&#xD;
      among users who report abstinence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial of a Quitline incentive versus tobacco cessation&#xD;
      incentive versus no financial incentive on adolescent engagement with a tobacco cessation&#xD;
      program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting/Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting: Primary care sites within the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia (CHOP's) Pediatric&#xD;
      Research Consortium along with other non-clinical community settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 adolescent tobacco users will be recruited. Eligibility criteria include adolescents (aged&#xD;
      14-21 years), who speak English, screen positive for tobacco use during their routine well&#xD;
      child or acute visit, are interested in quitting, and have a smart phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Interventions and Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adolescents will be randomized to 1 of 3 financial incentive groups: (1) Quitline Incentive:&#xD;
      the payment structure emphasizes engaging with the Quitline, with an additional smaller&#xD;
      payment for tobacco cessation; (2) Tobacco Cessation Incentive: the payment structure&#xD;
      emphasizes quitting regardless of engagement with the quitline (though the quitline will be&#xD;
      presented as a helpful tool); and (3) no financial incentive. The Quitline is funded by the&#xD;
      Pennsylvania Department of Health and staffed by trained cessation counselors available 24&#xD;
      hours a day, 7 days a week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes Measures: Objective 1: The main outcome of interest is adolescent completion of the&#xD;
      tobacco cessation program, defined as the proportion of tobacco users identified in the&#xD;
      clinic that enroll, use, and complete the Quitline program compared across the 3 groups.&#xD;
      Objective 2: The secondary outcome is to confirm abstinence, via salivary cotinine&#xD;
      concentration of &lt;30 ng per milliliter at 10 weeks after the start of the study.&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Despite efforts to recruit and enroll adolescents, identifying cigarette and e-cigarette users&#xD;
    proved challenging. The study team was unable to meet the recruitment goal of 60 adolescents.&#xD;

Way to Health (WTH) Platform: The WTH platform is a web-based platform that sends reminder text messages to participants regarding study procedures and has has secure financial tracking and processing systems to manage participant payments, including the ability to track earnings and pay participants via a non-integrated payment system.&#xD;
Quitline Delivered Treatment: The quitline provides tobacco cessation treatment to individuals who enroll in treatment. This treatment includes 5 proactive counseling calls, each designed to help develop problem-solving and coping skills, secure social support, and plan for long-term abstinence. Participants can also call an 800 telephone number as needed for additional support between proactive calls.</description>
