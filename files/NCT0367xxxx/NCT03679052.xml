      Enrollment After approval by the institute ethics committee, this study was conducted at&#xD;
      Ain-Shams university hospitals, from the1st of March 2018 till the 31st of August 2018, on&#xD;
      300 patients aged 18-60 years and body weight 60-100 Kg of the American Society of&#xD;
      Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I or II who underwent urological surgeries under&#xD;
      spinal anesthesia. A written informed consent will be obtained from all patients to&#xD;
      participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's refusal, duration of surgery more than 120 min, obesity with body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      &gt;35 kg/m2, generalized infection or localized infection at level of blockade, neurologic&#xD;
      disease, coagulation disorder, patients with hypo- or hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      disease, psychological disorders, a need for blood transfusion during surgery, an initial&#xD;
      body temperature &gt;38.0C or &lt;36.0C, a known history of alcohol or substance abuse, or&#xD;
      receiving vasodilators, or medications likely to alter thermoregulation excluded the patient&#xD;
      from the study Randomization and Blinding This study was designed to be a randomized,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled, double-blinded parallel study. Following enrollment, patients were&#xD;
      randomized into 3 equal groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Group I (Mirtazapine group): (n=100) each patient received 30 mg mirtazapine tablet and&#xD;
           a placebo tablet for clonidine orally with sips of water 2 h preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Group II (Clonidine group): (n=100) each patient received 150 µg clonidine tablet and a&#xD;
           placebo tablet for mirtazapine orally with sips of water 2 h preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Group III (Control group): (n=100) each patient received two placebo tablets for&#xD;
           mirtazapine and clonidine orally with sips of water 2 h preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done using computer-generated table of random numbers in a 1:1 ratio in&#xD;
      opaque and sealed envelope (SNOSE). The assigned treatment was written on a card and sealed&#xD;
      in opaque envelopes consecutively numbered. These envelopes were opened just immediately&#xD;
      before infusing the medication in the patient's room. The study drugs were prepared by the&#xD;
      hospital pharmacy and follow-up of patients were conducted by anesthesia residents not&#xD;
      involved in any other part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol On arrival in the operating theatre, all patients had an inserted venous&#xD;
      cannula. I.V. fluids were preheated to 37oC. No other warming device was used. Lactated&#xD;
      Ringer's solution was warmed to 37 oC and was infused at 10 ml/kg over 30 min before spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia. The infusion rate was reduced to 6 ml/ kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subarachnoid anesthesia was instituted at either L3/4 or L4/5 interspaces. Hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine, 5 mg /ml, 15 mg was injected using a 25 G Quincke spinal needle, Supplemental&#xD;
      oxygen (5 liter/ min) was delivered via a facemask during the operation. All patients were&#xD;
      covered with one layer of surgical drapes over the chest, thighs, and calves during the&#xD;
      operation and one cotton blanket over the entire body after operation. The operating and&#xD;
      recovery rooms temperatures were maintained at 23-25°C with approximately 60% humidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment parameters Heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation were recorded using standard noninvasive monitors before intrathecal injection and&#xD;
      thereafter at 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes then every 10 minutes to complete 90 minutes from the&#xD;
      intrathecal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory levels were assessed by pinprick to determine the peak sensory level and time to two&#xD;
      segment regression in minutes. Motor block was assessed by using Modified Bromage scale(14)&#xD;
      (0 = no block 1 = hip block, 2 = hip and knee block, 3 = hip, knee, and ankle block) to&#xD;
      determine the time to reach complete motor block and duration of motor blockade (minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation score was assessed with a four-point scale as per Filos et al.(15): 1: Awake and&#xD;
      alert. 2: Somnolent, but responsive to verbal stimuli. 3: Somnolent, arousable to physical&#xD;
      stimuli. 4: Unarousable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body temperature (axillary temperature) was recorded with an axillary thermometer. The&#xD;
      ambient temperature was measured by a wall thermometer. The ambient temperature was&#xD;
      maintained at 25oC with constant humidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shivering if occurred was graded using a scale similar to that validated by Badjatia et al&#xD;
      (16):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. None: no shivering noted on palpation of the masseter, neck, or chest wall&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mild: shivering localized to the neck and/or thorax only&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Moderate: shivering involved gross movement of the upper extremities (in addition to&#xD;
           neck and thorax)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Severe: shivering involved gross movements of the trunk and upper and lower extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shivering was assessed immediately before the block and every 10 minutes till the end of&#xD;
      surgery and for another 20 min in the recovery room. Grade 3 or 4 of shivering score was&#xD;
      regarded failure of prophylaxis, meperidine 25 mg IV was administered and no assessment of&#xD;
      shivering was done.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side-effects, including hypotension (defined as a decrease in MAP of more than 20% from&#xD;
      baseline or a decrease of arterial blood pressure below 90 mmHg and baseline MAP was&#xD;
      calculated from three measurements taken on the ward before surgery) was treated by&#xD;
      crystalloid infusion and if necessary ephedrine 5 mg IV was administered. The amount of&#xD;
      ephedrine given in each group was recorded. Bradycardia was considered if the heart rate &lt;50&#xD;
      beats/min and was treated with IV atropine (0.01mg/kg). If there was respiratory depression&#xD;
      (RR &lt; 12 bpm) and a decrease in arterial SpO2 (&lt;90%), it was treated with oxygen through a&#xD;
      transparent face mask. Incidence of nausea and vomiting during early 2 hours postoperatively&#xD;
      were recorded. IV granisetron (1 mg) was given in case of vomiting or after 2 successive&#xD;
      episodes of nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's satisfaction was done by asking the patient to answer the question, &quot;How would you&#xD;
      rate your experience after the surgery?&quot; using a 7-point Likert verbal rating scale(17):&#xD;
      [Figure 1] and acceptable satisfaction score of the patient being 5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Likert scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 2 3 4 5 6 7 Extremely dissatisfied Dissatisfied Somewhat dissatisfied Undecided Somewhat&#xD;
      satisfied Satisfied Extremely satisfied Figure 1: A 7-point Likert-like verbal rating scale&#xD;
      for assessment of patients' satisfaction(17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Endpoint: The study end point was 20 minutes after the end of the procedure (in the recovery&#xD;
      room)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total participants received pethidine for treatment of post-spinal shivering in the three&#xD;
      groups till 20 minutes after the end of the procedure (in the recovery room)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence, onset, severity and duration of post-spinal shivering.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Time to first analgesic request, from the end of surgery up to approximately six hours&#xD;
           after surgery&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of hypotension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of bradycardia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of nausea and vomiting during early 2 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient' satisfaction towards shivering prophylaxis was assessed 24 hours after the&#xD;
           procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           3-Analysis of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on Shah et al., 2016 who found that shivering was 17.5% and 40.0% in Ondansetron&#xD;
      and control respectively(18) and on Bagle et al., 2016 who found that shivering was 10.0% and&#xD;
      40.0% in clonidine and control respectively(6) and assuming the power= 0.80 and α=0.05, and&#xD;
      by using PASS 11th release the minimal sample size for an equal controlled study to detect a&#xD;
      significant statistical difference between ondansetron &amp; clonidine and control is 80 women in&#xD;
      each group. We recruited 100 women in each group for possible attrition(19).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data were coded, tabulated, and statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS&#xD;
      statistics (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software version 22.0, IBM Corp.,&#xD;
      Chicago, USA, 2013.&#xD;
