  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of obesity is increasing worldwide and obesity is an important risk factor for&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. In addition, back pain has been increasing steadily due to sitting&#xD;
      life, lack of exercise, wrong posture, and obesity. Recent studies found that obesity and&#xD;
      back pain are common diseases and are closely related to each other. People with back pain&#xD;
      have lower physical activity, which in turn leads to an weight gain and a deterioration in&#xD;
      physical performance. Among the drugs used for obesity, orlistat has been approved for&#xD;
      long-term use, and phentermine, the most commonly used drug, has been approved for short-term&#xD;
      use. However, phentermine can increase blood pressure and pulse rate. Meanwhile, several&#xD;
      studies have shown that orlistat, a pancreatic lipase inhibitor, lowers blood pressure and&#xD;
      pulse rate and diminish LDL-cholesterol. Lowering LDL-C could lead to improved vascular&#xD;
      endothelial function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to investigate the effect of orlistat and phentermine combination&#xD;
      therapy on weight loss and improvement of vascular function compared to phentermine&#xD;
      monotherapy in obese patients (BMI 27 kg/m2) with metabolic risk and back pain.&#xD;

      The investigators aimed to investigate the effect of orlistat and phentermine combination&#xD;
      therapy on weight loss and improvement of vascular function compared to phentermine&#xD;
      monotherapy in obese patients (BMI 27 kg/m2) with metabolic risk and back pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials (12 weeks), Patients: Obese patients (BMI 27&#xD;
      kg/m2) with metabolic risk and back pain&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were divided into two groups: orlistat (120mg, three times a day), phentermine&#xD;
      (37.5 mg, once a day) combined Group (N = 57), placebo (placebo, three times a day) and&#xD;
      phentermine (37.5 mg, once a day) Group (N=57).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomly assigned to each group at 1: 1, and allocation codes are generated using SAS (Ver.&#xD;
      9.2). The investigators provide orlistat and phentermine or placebo and phentermine. The&#xD;
      investigators check physical measurement, blood test, questionnaire, blood pressure and&#xD;
      pulse, body composition, FMD, heart rate variability test, in the first visit. The&#xD;
      investigators check for changes in body weight, compliance, and side effects after 4 weeks&#xD;
      and 8 weeks, respectively. After 12 weeks, the investigators re-check physical measurement,&#xD;
      blood test, questionnaire, blood pressure and pulse, body composition, FMD, heart rate&#xD;
      variability test.&#xD;
