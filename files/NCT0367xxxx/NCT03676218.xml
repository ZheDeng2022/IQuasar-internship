      Context and hypothesis: In cancer randomized controlled trials (RCT), the validated and most&#xD;
      objective criterion to assess treatment efficacy is overall survival (OS). In the elderly&#xD;
      population, OS presents limitations as it can be affected by factors other than treatment&#xD;
      such as comorbidity or severe toxicity. Although mortality reduction is important for&#xD;
      patients of all ages, alternative outcomes such as the ability to live independently or with&#xD;
      a better quality of life, may be more important for older patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reviews of RCT have highlighted (i) the heterogeneity of such alternative efficacy outcomes&#xD;
      and (ii) an absence of standardized definitions for these endpoints. As a result, this may&#xD;
      limit the quality of RCT as well as the comparison of results across trials. Our objective is&#xD;
      to provide guidelines for standardized definitions of such alternative endpoints to assess&#xD;
      treatment efficacy in cancer RCT in elderly populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of guidelines will follow a formal consensus method (questionnaires +&#xD;
      in-person meetings). A large panel of international experts will participate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Guidelines are awaited due to the heterogeneity of endpoints and absence of standardized&#xD;
      definitions. Standardizing definitions will improve the quality and design of future trials&#xD;
      and enhance comparison between trials.&#xD;

      In cancer randomized controlled trials (RCT), the validated and most objectively defined&#xD;
      evaluation criterion is overall survival (OS - delay between randomization and death).&#xD;
      Therapeutic progress, the current context of strategic trials, and the multiplication of&#xD;
      lines of treatment have resulted in the necessity to identify evaluation criteria other than&#xD;
      OS, which can be observed more frequently and sooner. Endpoints such as progression-free&#xD;
      survival (PFS) or disease-free survival (DFS) are commonly used instead of OS in RCT. The&#xD;
      priority for patients, however, is to live longer or better, and ideally both, which raises&#xD;
      the question as to the suitability of these tumor-specific endpoints to assess the&#xD;
      benefit/risk balance associated to a new therapy in elderly patients with cancer. Older&#xD;
      patients may die from causes other than cancer, and relapse does not necessarily shorten&#xD;
      survival. Instead, cancer therapy can sometimes cause severe acute or chronic toxicities and&#xD;
      affect functional status or health-related quality of life (HRQoL), and as such these&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes (e.g. autonomy, quality of life) should be given more attention. On&#xD;
      the basis of these considerations, OS may not be the most appropriate outcome to measure&#xD;
      treatment benefit in the elderly cancer population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Geriatric oncology experts and task forces including the International Society of Geriatric&#xD;
      Oncology, the European Organization for Research and Treatment Cancer (EORTC) and the DIALOG&#xD;
      research group (Dialogue Intergroupe pour la personnALisation de la prise en charge en&#xD;
      OncoGériatrie), have acknowledged the heterogeneity of primary endpoints used in RCT&#xD;
      conducted in elderly cancer patients. This heterogeneity, in terms of dimension&#xD;
      (tumor-centered outcomes, patient-centered outcomes including autonomy, nutrition, etc.) and&#xD;
      definitions limits the comparison of results across trials. In addition, this can make the&#xD;
      design of trials particularly complex since estimation of sample size is usually based on&#xD;
      results from past trials. Acknowledging the specificities of the elderly population, the&#xD;
      DATECAN-Elderly project is aimed at providing guidelines for the definition of efficacy&#xD;
      endpoints that will permit to assess new treatments/interventions in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DATECAN-Elderly project is a continuation of the development of guidelines within the&#xD;
      DATECAN initiative (Definition for the Assessment of Time-to-event Endpoints in CANcer&#xD;
      trials). This international initiative was launched in 2009 to elaborate standardized&#xD;
      definitions for survival endpoints in RCT, based on a rigorous and validated consensus&#xD;
      methodology. This work has resulted in the publication of guidelines to define time-to-event&#xD;
      endpoints to be used in randomized trials for specific cancer sites: sarcomas, pancreas,&#xD;
      breast, and other. These guidelines however were not developed for the elderly cancer&#xD;
      patients. Events specifically accounted for included exclusively tumor-oriented events (e.g.&#xD;
      local, regional, metastatic progressions, or deaths due to various causes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our past experience and expertise within the DATECAN initiative, we will rely on the&#xD;
      same methodology to develop guidelines for the definitions of endpoints to assess treatment&#xD;
      efficacy in elderly cancer RCT. The development of the definitions of the endpoints will be&#xD;
      based on a rigorous and validated consensus methodology (formal modified Delphi consensus&#xD;
      process). We will focus on (i) the dimensions to be accounted for when assessing treatment&#xD;
      efficacy (OS, HRQoL, autonomy, etc), (ii) the quantification of dimensions (selection of the&#xD;
      questionnaires), and (iii) the incorporation of these dimensions into trial design.&#xD;
      DATECAN-Elderly guidelines will be developed in cooperation with many experts (30 to 50) in&#xD;
      the field of geriatric oncology and clinical trials from different scientific backgrounds&#xD;
      (medical oncologists, geriatricians, biostatisticians, etc.) and groups/societies (DIALOG,&#xD;
      SIOG, EORTC, etc.), favouring the acceptability of the resulting recommendations.&#xD;
      Recommendations developed through international collaborations and through a formal and&#xD;
      validated consensus process can increase chances of becoming widely adopted through a&#xD;
      democratic process to reach consensus, and, as such, help in the standardization process of&#xD;
      the definitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results of the DATECAN-Elderly project are expected to address the heterogeneity regarding&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints used as primary endpoints in elderly cancer trials. Providing definitions&#xD;
      for endpoints should lead to the evaluation of treatment more consistent with patient's&#xD;
      experiences and expectations about treatment outcome. Overall, the project should help&#xD;
      provide trials' results which are more relevant for the elderly patients, improves the&#xD;
      recruitment of elderly patient in RCT, and finally enhance trials' comparison and design.&#xD;
