      To evaluate the postoperative pain and the relapse after the repair of the inguinal hernia by&#xD;
      Lichtenstein technique with four different mesh types with different types of fixation in&#xD;
      patients undergoing major ambulatory surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the widespread use of meshes in the repair of inguinal hernia, recurrence rates have&#xD;
      acceptable values, so, today, the focus is on trying to decrease chronic pain after&#xD;
      hernioplasty. Chronic postoperative inguinal pain (CPIP) is an important clinical problem,&#xD;
      which can significantly influence the quality of life of the patient. Different studies have&#xD;
      published CPIP rates from 9.7% to 51.6%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The reasons for CPIP are unclear; Lesion and entrapment of the nerves, the type of mesh used,&#xD;
      and the fixation material of this has been related to the causes of inguinodynia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CPIP can be divided into neuropathic pain and non-neuropathic pain. According to the&#xD;
      International Association for the Study of Pain (IASP), neuropathic pain is caused by the&#xD;
      primary lesion or nerve dysfunction, causing burn-like pain that radiates through the area&#xD;
      innervated by the injured nerve, intensifying the nerve with light touch. The causes of this&#xD;
      type of pain are the entrapment of the nerve by the mesh or sutures or by the formation of&#xD;
      neuromas associated with the partial or complete transection of the nerve. The nerves that&#xD;
      run through the inguinal region and are therefore susceptible to injury when the anterior&#xD;
      approach is the ilioinguinal nerve, the genitofemoral genital branch, and the iliohypogastric&#xD;
      nerve.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuropathic pain may occur immediately after surgery, but may also occur months or years&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-neuropathic or nociceptive pain is caused by the activation of mediators of inflammation&#xD;
      due to the continuous inflammatory reaction that occurs around the mesh. According to Amid,&#xD;
      nociceptive pain is caused by the mechanical pressure of the mesh over adjacent tissue,&#xD;
      including the vas deferens and nerves. This type of pain is acute and stabbing and is&#xD;
      aggravated by intense exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In conclusion, the use of foreign materials in hernia surgery may induce intense inflammation&#xD;
      that can result in chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of our work is that: &quot;The use of glue-attached meshes (self-adhesive) compared&#xD;
      to those fixed with suture present lower rates of post-hernioplasty pain&quot;.&#xD;
