  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      40 participants with Eosinophilic Gastritis 12-70 years of age will be randomly assigned with&#xD;
      dupilumab or placebo subcutaneous injections every two weeks for a total of 12 weeks. Study&#xD;
      subjects who complete the 12-week treatment phase, may continue into an open label extension&#xD;
      study, where dupilumab will be administered every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase 2, multi-center, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial testing&#xD;
      the efficacy of dupilumab vs. placebo in EG. Qualifying subjects will be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      either study drug (dupilumab) or placebo, and will receive 600 mg once followed by 300 mg&#xD;
      doses every two weeks of study treatment for a total of 6 injections. After the 6th injection&#xD;
      subjects may continue into an open-label treatment phase in which dupilumab will be&#xD;
      administered every two weeks for a total of 24 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 14 sites associated with the Consortium of Eosinophilic Gastrointestinal&#xD;
      Disease Researchers (CEGIR) will take part in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy of repeat subcutaneous (SC)&#xD;
      doses of dupilumab, compared with placebo, to reduce eosinophilic inflammation in the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract of patients with EG.&#xD;

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in histologic score from pre- to post-treatment with dupilumab or placebo as measured by the Eosinophilic Gastritis Biopsy Evaluation Form. The EG Biopsy Evaluation Form assesses 11 different types of histological features, each one rated from 0-2 (0 = absent, 1 = mild/moderate, 2 = marked), with a maximum score of 22 (most severe) and a minimum score of 0 (normal).</description>

    <description>Change in endoscopic score from pre- to post-treatment with dupilumab or placebo as measured by Eosinophilic Gastritis Endoscopic Assessment. The Eosinophilic Gastritis Endoscopy Assessment captures 6 endoscopic features of the stomach, each scored from 0-6, varying by endoscopic feature. The maximum score is 43 (most severe), and the minimum is 0 (normal).</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment with dupilumab or placebo as measured by the Severity of Dyspepsia Assessment (SoDA) tool. The SoDA measures 3 domains: Pain Intensity (scored from 2-47, with 47 being the most severe), Non-pain symptoms (scored from 7-35, with 35 being the most severe), and SoDA satisfaction (scored from 2-23, with 23 being the most satisfied). Each domain is assessed independently; they are not summed or averaged.</description>

    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>The baseline values of blood biomarkers (primarily cytokine levels) as well as esophageal transcripts will be assessed before and after treatment. We will determine if baseline values correlate with drug responsiveness.</description>
