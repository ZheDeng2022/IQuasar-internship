    <textblock>
      The prevalence of birth canal lacerations is more than 70% of all deliveries in Canada. The&#xD;
      repair of such lacerations is usually done using a pre-existing epidural analgesia. Once the&#xD;
      analgesic effect of the epidural analgesia fades, the laceration may cause intolerable pain,&#xD;
      and result in emotional stress, difficulties in ambulation and breastfeeding, and more.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research team hypothesis is that adding a locally injected analgesic, which will take&#xD;
      effect once the epidural analgesia fades, may alleviate perineal pain, prevent such&#xD;
      difficulties, and improve women's overall well-being and satisfaction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed trial is a two-arm, single-masked, randomized trial. Women with a working&#xD;
      epidural analgesia, and a laceration will be invited to participate. Women in the local&#xD;
      anesthesia (LA) arm will get a LA injected to the laceration and women in the sham arm will&#xD;
      get no injection. The differences in perineal pain between the groups will be evaluated at 6&#xD;
      hours after last epidural dose.&#xD;

      1. The Need for the Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.1. Background&#xD;
&#xD;
           Perineal trauma during delivery may be iatrogenic (episiotomy) or spontaneous (perineal&#xD;
           tear). First-degree injury involves the perineal skin only, while a 2nd-degree perineal&#xD;
           tear (2PT) involves perineal muscles as well1,2. A 3rd-degree tear involves the anal&#xD;
           sphincter, and a 4th-degree tear involves the entire anal sphincter complex (external&#xD;
           and internal anal sphincters) and the anal epithelium1,2. An episiotomy (Epi) is usually&#xD;
           performed in a mediolateral or lateral manner, and is considered a 2nd degree laceration&#xD;
           by definition. The morbidity associated with obstetrical anal sphincter injury (3rd or&#xD;
           4th degree perineal tear) is considerably higher than in 1st or 2nd degree tear1,2.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The repair of a perineal tear may be done using the epidural anesthesia that was used&#xD;
           during delivery, with no additional analgesia. If the patient is delivered without an&#xD;
           epidural anesthesia, a short-acting local anesthetic agent, such as lidocaine, may be&#xD;
           infiltrated to the edges of the wound prior to suturing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Scope of the problem The annual number of deliveries in Canada approaches 390,000, of&#xD;
           which more than 145,000 are anticipated to take place in Ontario3. It has been reported&#xD;
           that approximately 70% of deliveries in Ontario are vaginal deliveries4. Episiotomies&#xD;
           occur in approximately 20% of vaginal deliveries, with 50% a 1st or 2nd degree perineal&#xD;
           tear occur, and 3.2% of vaginal deliveries are complicated by a 3rd or 4th degree&#xD;
           perineal tear4,5.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pain and morbidity associated with perineal lacerations Numerous studies have addressed&#xD;
           the short- and long-term pain and morbidity associated with perineal lacerations. While&#xD;
           numbers vary according to local practices and cultural and ethnical differences, most&#xD;
           agree that perineal trauma is a major source of pain and morbidity6-12. Most studies&#xD;
           reported Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) or Visual Analog Scale (VAS) scores in which pain is&#xD;
           ranked by the patient verbally (from 0 to 10) or on a 10-cm ruler13, respectively. Some&#xD;
           of the studies have reported VAS scores associated with 2PT/Epi of more than 5, and up&#xD;
           to 8.5, in the first postpartum day7,9,12. Moreover, it has been shown that perineal&#xD;
           lacerations, iatrogenic or spontaneous, are associated with interference with daily&#xD;
           activities such as sitting, ambulation, urination and bowel movements14-19. Some have&#xD;
           reported that more than 55% of women with 2PT/Epi experienced interference with at least&#xD;
           one daily activity that was attributed to perineal pain7, and others have shown that&#xD;
           between 45-75% of women with 2PT/Epi complained of at least moderate pain while sitting&#xD;
           or moving10. Perineal pain associated with 2PT/Epi was also found to interfere with&#xD;
           breastfeeding, and proper analgesia was found to have a beneficial effect on this&#xD;
           matter14-16. Furthermore, acute pain during the immediate postpartum period was found to&#xD;
           be associated with a higher risk of persistent pain 8 weeks postpartum, as well as with&#xD;
           the development of postpartum depression7. The authors hypothesized that the severity of&#xD;
           acute pain is not just a marker for the development of persistent pain, but also plays a&#xD;
           role in the plasticity pathophysiology of acute-to-chronic pain transition.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Pain relief - current practice&#xD;
&#xD;
           As stated, perineal tear is usually repaired and sutured using the pre-existing epidural&#xD;
           anesthesia that was used for delivery. Once the epidural anesthesia fades, the women&#xD;
           will likely experience some perineal pain, mainly during the first 24 hours postpartum.&#xD;
           Several studies have examined the benefits of different analgesic regimens, including&#xD;
           oral or rectal analgesics, non-pharmacological methods, and topical anesthetics20-25. In&#xD;
           most institutions, oral analgesics are provided, whether in a pre-scheduled analgesic&#xD;
           plan or as per patient request.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Despite efforts to alleviate perineal pain, current acceptable pain management protocols&#xD;
           have several limitations. First, the use of systematic medications in order to treat&#xD;
           local pain may induce side effects, and fail to target the specific pain on the other.&#xD;
           Second, many women have concerns regarding the use of systemic medications along with&#xD;
           breastfeeding, despite reassurance from medical staff. Topically applied anesthetics&#xD;
           were not proven to alleviate postpartum perineal tear, and rectal analgesia was only&#xD;
           studied as a single agent compared to placebo, and not as an adjunct to commonly used&#xD;
           pain management protocols, thus no superiority was shown.&#xD;
&#xD;
           At Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre), a per-patient-request protocol is instituted,&#xD;
           which includes acetaminophen (oral, 1000mg every 6 hours, PRN) and naproxen (oral, 400mg&#xD;
           every 6 hours, PRN). Additionally, patients may ask for topical lidocaine 4% solution&#xD;
           and oral oxycodone 5-10 mg every 4 hours (up to 40 mg/day in breastfeeding mothers).&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.2. Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Injecting a long-acting local anesthetic into the edges of 2PT/Epi, before suturing, in&#xD;
           women who had a vaginal delivery with an epidural anesthesia, will provide longer and&#xD;
           more efficient pain relief compared with the common practice of not using local&#xD;
           anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3. Research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.1. Primary research question&#xD;
&#xD;
           Using the PICOT technique, the primary research question addresses five main aspects of&#xD;
           the trial: population, intervention, comparison, outcome, and time.&#xD;
&#xD;
           P: In women who have had a vaginal delivery under an epidural anesthesia and have&#xD;
           experienced an episiotomy or a 2nd degree perineal tear, I: Does the local injection of&#xD;
           bupivacaine to the edges of 2PT/Epi C: compared to a current practice of no analgesic O:&#xD;
           increase or decrease perineal pain T: 6 hours after last epidural bolus?&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.3.2. Other research questions&#xD;
&#xD;
           In women who have had a vaginal delivery under an epidural anesthesia and have&#xD;
           experienced an episiotomy or a 2nd degree tear, does the local injection of bupivacaine&#xD;
           to the edges of 2PT/Epi compared to no analgesic increase or decrease -&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to first ambulation (getting out of bed for any activity).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to first analgesic administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of analgesics administrations during the 24 hours after last epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perineal pain at 12 and 24 hours (±30 minutes) after last epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Most severe perineal pain in rest during the first 12 and 24 hours after last&#xD;
                epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Most severe perineal pain while sitting during the first 12 and 24 hours after last&#xD;
                epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Most severe perineal pain during walking and breastfeeding during the first 12 and&#xD;
                24 hours after last epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Most severe perineal pain during breastfeeding during the first 12 and 24 hours&#xD;
                after last epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Most severe perineal pain in rest, sitting, walking and breastfeeding during the&#xD;
                first 12 and 24 hours after last epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           1.4. Supporting evidence for the hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Potential intervention - local infiltration of surgical wound with local anesthetics&#xD;
&#xD;
           Local anesthetics have been used in multimodal anesthesia regimens in order to reduce&#xD;
           the need for post-operative analgesia, mainly opioids26. Several reports have&#xD;
           demonstrated the efficacy of local infiltration of anesthetics in surgical wounds. Some&#xD;
           have found reductions in both post-operative analgesia use and VAS scores, while some&#xD;
           reported more modest outcomes27-33.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Local infiltration of perineal lacerations with local anesthesia agent or saline&#xD;
&#xD;
           Two studies have examined infiltration of perineal laceration as a preventative measure&#xD;
           to provide longer-acting pain relief once the epidural anesthesia fades.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The first, by Khan and Lilford, dates back to 198734. In their study, they compared&#xD;
           three groups of women with episiotomies (50 women in each group): group 1 had an&#xD;
           epidural anesthesia, group 2 had an epidural anesthesia and local infiltration of&#xD;
           saline, and group 3 did not have epidural anesthesia, and received lignocaine prior to&#xD;
           suture of the episiotomy. They excluded women with large perineal tears, extended&#xD;
           episiotomies or third degree perineal tears. They have found that both group 2 and 3 had&#xD;
           lower pain scores on day 1 postpartum, and that group 2 (epidural + saline) had the&#xD;
           lowest pain scores. They concluded that the artificial swelling induced by the&#xD;
           infiltrated agents (regardless of which agent) accommodates the inflammatory edematous&#xD;
           response, thus preventing the compression of the tissue by the sutures, and preventing&#xD;
           the pain resulting from it. This study had some limitations in that it was not blinded,&#xD;
           it excluded perineal tears, was performed three decades ago when practices were&#xD;
           different, and did not control for different confounders.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The second report is more recent, yet only patients with episiotomies were included35.&#xD;
           In this double-blind randomized prospective study, infiltration with 15 mL of 0.75%&#xD;
           ropivacaine, 1% lidocaine, or saline was performed immediately before initiating the&#xD;
           perineal repair. A total of 154 patients were included. The authors did not find any&#xD;
           differences between time to first oral analgesic request or pain scores during the first&#xD;
           24 hours postpartum. Yet, while this study employed a more adequate methodology, it did&#xD;
           not compare patients to common practice (which is to infiltrate no agent), it included&#xD;
           only women with episiotomies and excluded women with operative vaginal deliveries, and&#xD;
           did not report the power of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bupivacaine&#xD;
&#xD;
           Bupivacaine Hydrochloride is 2-Piperidinecarboxamide,&#xD;
           1-butyl-N-(2,6-dimethylphenyl)-monohydrochloride, monohydrate, a white crystalline&#xD;
           powder that is freely soluble in 95 percent ethanol, soluble in water, and slightly&#xD;
           soluble in chloroform or acetone. It is available in sterile isotonic solutions with and&#xD;
           without epinephrine (as bitartrate) 1:200,000 for injection via local infiltration,&#xD;
           peripheral nerve block, and caudal and lumbar epidural blocks. It is related chemically&#xD;
           and pharmacologically to the aminoacyl local anesthetics, and is chemically related to&#xD;
           lidocaine.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The onset of action with Bupivacaine Hydrochloride is rapid and anesthesia is long&#xD;
           lasting. The duration of anesthesia is significantly longer with Bupivacaine&#xD;
           Hydrochloride than with any other commonly used local anesthetic. It has also been noted&#xD;
           that there is a period of analgesia that persists after the return of sensation, during&#xD;
           which time the need for strong analgesics is reduced. The half-life of Bupivacaine&#xD;
           Hydrochloride in adults is 2.7 hours36. Bupivacaine was chosen for the purpose of this&#xD;
           study since it is long-acting37 and likely to provide pain relief once the epidural&#xD;
           analgesia has subsided.&#xD;
&#xD;
           How will the information from the study be used? If the proposed hypothesis will be&#xD;
           proven, better pain management could be offerred to women, and improve the quality of&#xD;
           postpartum care. In addition, alleviation of postpartum perineal pain will enable women&#xD;
           to take better care of their offspring.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The Proposed Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.1. Proposed Trial design&#xD;
&#xD;
           The proposed trial will be a two-armed, randomized, single-masked, controlled trial&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2. Planned interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.1. Randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
           Once a woman has consented to be considered for the trial, eligibility must be&#xD;
           confirmed. Once eligibility has been confirmed, the women will be randomized into the&#xD;
           study using computer-generated sequence and sealed envelopes to one of three study arms:&#xD;
           Bupivacaine injection or sham injection to reflect current care.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.2. All study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           Prior to injection of the intervention drug, the patient will be asked to press the&#xD;
           bolus button of the epidural analgesia; the time of this occurs will be recorded. The&#xD;
           length of the 2PT/Epi will be measured in centimeters and documented. The laceration&#xD;
           will be sutured using 2-0 Caprosyn suture. Subcuticular sutures will be used for skin&#xD;
           closure.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.3. Bupivacaine arm&#xD;
&#xD;
           The edges of the 2PT/Epi will be infiltrated with 10ml of Bupivacaine 0.5%+Epinephrine&#xD;
           50mcg prior to suture placement.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.2.4. Control arm&#xD;
&#xD;
           Sham injection will be done using a syringe filled with 10ml of NaCl 0.9%, but the fluid&#xD;
           will not be injected to the edges of the laceration but discarded. The sham injection&#xD;
           will last no less than 10 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.3. Methods of protecting against bias&#xD;
&#xD;
           The randomization will be done using a computer software. The patients and their&#xD;
           companions will be asked not to observe the injection process. The physician performing&#xD;
           the perineal repair will prepare the injection outside the patient's room. The nursing&#xD;
           staff who will be directly involved with the care of the patients will be masked to the&#xD;
           assigned arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4. Planned inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4.1. Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Maternal age &gt; 18 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Gestational age≥34 weeks of gestation&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Vaginal delivery&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Perineal laceration (2PT/Epi)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Effective epidural anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  No known hypersensitivity to bupivacaine or amino-amide anesthetics&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.4.2. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Medical history of a chronic pain syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intrapartum morphine use&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.5. Duration of treatment period The treatment will be given as a single dose.&#xD;
           Follow-up will take place for 24 hours after the last bolus dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.6. Primary outcome and other outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.6.1. Primary outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome will be the proportion of women in the bupivacaine arm and the no&#xD;
           analgesic arm who have a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score≤4 at 6-hours (±30 minutes)&#xD;
           after last epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Numeric Rating Scale (NRS)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The NRS for pain is a unidimensional measure of pain intensity in adults. It is a&#xD;
           segmented numeric version of the visual analog scale (VAS) in which a respondent selects&#xD;
           a whole number (0-10 integers) that best reflects the intensity of their pain. The NRS&#xD;
           is anchored by terms describing pain severity extremes, with 0 representing one pain&#xD;
           extreme (e.g., &quot;no pain&quot;) and 10 representing the other pain extreme (e.g., &quot;pain as bad&#xD;
           as you can imagine&quot; and &quot;worst pain imaginable&quot;). The number that the respondent&#xD;
           indicates on the scale to rate their pain intensity is recorded. Scores range from 0&#xD;
           -1013.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Visual Analog Scale (VAS)&#xD;
&#xD;
           The pain VAS is a continuous scale comprised of a horizontal or vertical line, usually&#xD;
           10 centimeters (100 mm) in length, anchored by 2 verbal descriptors, one for each&#xD;
           symptom extreme. The respondent is asked to place a line perpendicular to the VAS line&#xD;
           at the point that represents their pain intensity. The score is determined by measuring&#xD;
           the distance (mm) on the 10-cm line between the &quot;no pain&quot; anchor and the patient's mark,&#xD;
           providing a range of scores from 0-100 (mm) or 0-10 (cm). A higher score indicates&#xD;
           greater pain intensity. Based on the distribution of pain VAS scores in postsurgical&#xD;
           patients, the following cut points on the pain VAS have been recommended: no pain (0-4&#xD;
           mm), mild pain (5-44 mm), moderate pain (45-74 mm), and severe pain (75- 100 mm). No&#xD;
           training is required other than the ability to use a ruler to measure distance to&#xD;
           determine a score13.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.6.3. Other outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
           The following are the other outcomes which will be compared among the three intervention&#xD;
           arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to first ambulation (getting out of bed).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Time to first analgesic administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Number of administration of additional analgesics in the first 24 hours after last&#xD;
                epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  NRS at 12 and 24 hours (±30 minutes) after last epidural bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Highest NRS while in rest during the first 12 and 24 hours after last epidural&#xD;
                bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Highest NRS while sitting during the first 12 and 24 hours after last epidural&#xD;
                bolus.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Highest NRS while walking during the first 12 and 24 hours after last epidural&#xD;

&#xD;
           2.7. Sample size and planned Recruitment Rate&#xD;
&#xD;
           Group sample sizes of 323 in group one and 323 in group two achieve 80% power to detect&#xD;
           a difference between the group proportions of -0.0990 (30% reduction). The proportion in&#xD;
           group one (the treatment group) is assumed to be 0.3300 under the null hypothesis and&#xD;
           0.2310 under the alternative hypothesis. The proportion in group two (the control group)&#xD;
           is 0.3300. The test statistic used is the two-sided Z test with pooled variance. The&#xD;
           significance level of the test was targeted at 0.0500.&#xD;
&#xD;
           To account for 10% loss to follow-up the sample size will be inflated to 355 per group.&#xD;
           This will result in a total sample size of 710 for the 2 arms. The calculation was&#xD;
           carried out using PASS Version 12 (Hintze, J. (2014). NCSS, LLC. Kaysville, Utah.).&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.8. Analysis plan&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.8.1. Interim Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           An interim analysis of efficacy (the primary outcome) is planned when 50% of the total&#xD;
           subjects have outcome data available. The group sequential method of Lan and DeMets will&#xD;
           be used to characterize the rate at which the type I error is spent where the spending&#xD;
           function is the O'Brien-Fleming boundary. The nominal alpha level at the interim&#xD;
           analysis (50% of participants) is 0.0031 and at the final analysis (100%) is 0.049. In&#xD;
           addition, a futility analysis will be conducted whereby the probability of finding a&#xD;
           significant result at the end of the study will be calculated based on the current trend&#xD;
           in the data, the null and alternative hypotheses.&#xD;
&#xD;
           2.8.2. Final Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           Descriptive statistics will be calculated for all variables of interest. Continuous&#xD;
           measures such as age will be summarized using means and standard deviations whereas&#xD;
           categorical measures will be summarized using counts and percentages.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The primary outcome, proportion of women with NRS≥4 , will be compared between arms&#xD;
           using tests of proportions.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The secondary outcome, will be compared between arms using chi-square tests (or Fisher's&#xD;
           exact tests in the case of low expected cell counts).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The remaining outcome measures, such as Time to first ambulation, are continuous or&#xD;
           interval measures. These will be assessed using t-tests or Wilcoxon rank sum tests in&#xD;
           the case of non-normally distributed data.&#xD;
&#xD;
           All analyses will be carried out using SAS Version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).&#xD;
