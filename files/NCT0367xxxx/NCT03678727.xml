  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) covers a spectrum from reversible hepatic steatosis&#xD;
      to inflammation and fibrosis termed steatohepatitis (NASH) and cirrhosis. New evidence&#xD;
      indicates that NAFLD is associated with development of heart failure, abnormal ventricular&#xD;
      glucose and fatty acid (FA) utilisation and cardiosteatosis. The mechanisms behind cardiac&#xD;
      involvement and the progression from NAFL to NASH are poorly understood but must include&#xD;
      altered cardiac and intrahepatic lipid handling. In collaboration with renowned research&#xD;
      groups from Oxford, Mayo Clinic and Copenhagen we plan comprehensive kinetic studies of heart&#xD;
      and liver FA uptake and oxidation, ventricular function and substrate utilisation, and&#xD;
      hepatic triglyceride (TG) secretion in order to assess mechanisms governing cardiac and&#xD;
      hepatic lipid and glucose trafficking in subjects with NAFL and NASH and the relationship&#xD;
      with heart function. In addition, we will assess skeletal muscle and adipose tissue enzyme&#xD;
      activities, gene expression and protein concentrations in these subjects to define mechanisms&#xD;
      involved in the cross-talk between heart, liver, muscle and adipose tissues. We will address&#xD;
      these questions using innovative tracer techniques (11Cpalmitate, 11C acetate, 18FDG glucose&#xD;
      PET tracers and TG tracers) in combination with hepatic vein catherisation to study cardiac&#xD;
      and liver substrate trafficking, as well as NMR spectroscopy, echocardiography, muscle and&#xD;
      fat biopsies in combination with state-of-the art muscle and adipose tissue enzyme kinetics,&#xD;
      gene- and protein expression. Effects of acute exercise as well as GLP-1 agonist and SGLT-2&#xD;
      inhibitor treatment (alone and in combination) will be assessed. The overarching goals are to&#xD;
      define abnormalities and differences between NAFLD and NASH in hepatic lipid (FA and TG)&#xD;
      metabolism and to assess hepatic, adipose and skeletal muscle lipid and substrate&#xD;
      utilisation.&#xD;
