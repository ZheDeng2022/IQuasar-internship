  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate the effectiveness of the virtual 360° counselling&#xD;
      environment in the anxiety and adherence to treatment of the patients coming to CCTA&#xD;
      (coronary computed tomography angiography). The virtual, 360° environment 'Virtual 360°-tour&#xD;
      in coronary computed tomography' uses 360°- technology based on spherical panorama images and&#xD;
      resembles the spaces of the hospital according to the patient's pathway in CT-examination and&#xD;
      provides information to the patient at various stages of the pathway.&#xD;

      The virtual, 360° environment 'Virtual 360°-tour in coronary computed tomography' uses 360°-&#xD;
      technology based on spherical panorama images and resembles the spaces of the hospital&#xD;
      according to the patient's pathway in CT-examination and provides information to the patient&#xD;
      at various stages of the pathway. Patients who have referred first time to the coronary&#xD;
      computed tomography can access the virtual CT examination environment via link before&#xD;
      entering the hospital. Using the environment requires a network connection and is possible&#xD;
      with a computer, tablet or phone. The environment has digital counselling materials in text,&#xD;
      image, animation and video formats in three different virtual spaces/views, the environment&#xD;
      and examination are presented via pathway of example 59-year female patient with arterial&#xD;
      hypertension and exercise related chest pain (angina pectoris).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>anxiety measured with State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for adults (STAI)</measure>
    <time_frame>1 month</time_frame>
    <description>The STAI meter is a two-part adult anxiety meter developed by Charles D. Spielberger and his research team (1983). It separates situation related anxiety (STATE-A) from character related tendency towards anxiety (TRAIT-A). User evaluates his own current anxiety on a four-step scale with forty questions. The respondents choose from the following options at each question: 1 = no anxiety at all, 2 = slight anxiety, 3 = some anxiety 4 = very much anxiety. Scores range from 20 to 80: mild anxiety 20-39 points, moderate anxiety 40-59 points and strong anxiety 60-80 points.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>adherence to coronary artery disease (CAD) treatment measured with Adherence of People with Chronic Disease Instrument (ACDI)</measure>
    <time_frame>12 months</time_frame>
    <description>ACDI (Adherence of People with Chronic Disease Instrument) meter is self-reported adult adherence to treatment meter developed by Helvi Kyngäs (1999). It's suitable for assessment and monitoring of adherence to treatment in nursing and clinical trials. The meter's 40 questions measure the adherence to treatment on a five-point Likert scale. The instrument consists of 13 demographic data questions and 33 items on the following topics: adherence (medical care, responsibility, care planning and carrying out the care), and factors connected to adherence (support from physicians and nurses, sense of normality, support from relatives and friends, motivation and energy, consequences of treatments and fear of vision loss).</description>
