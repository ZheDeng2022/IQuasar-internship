      Diabetic foot ulcers are associated with high risk of amputation. About 50% of patients&#xD;
      undergoing non-traumatic lower limb amputations are diabetics5. The 5-year amputation rate is&#xD;
      estimated to be 19% with a mean time to amputation 58 months since the onset of an diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcer6.Because infection and tissue hypoxia are the major contributing factors for&#xD;
      non-healing diabetic foot ulcers, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) carries a potential benefit&#xD;
      for treating these problematic wounds that do not respond to standard therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of oxygen in the wound healing cascade and subsequent combatting action against&#xD;
      bacterial invasion, especially anaerobes, is well documented.14 Delayed or arrested healing&#xD;
      and the development of infection is a direct result from decreased perfusion and poor&#xD;
      oxygenation of tissue.15 The presence of wound hypoxia is an major etiological pathway in the&#xD;

      The Premise of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperbaric Oxygen as adjunctive therapy is effective towards the healing of diabetic lower&#xD;
      extremity ulcers and has a role to play in major amputation prevention for persons with&#xD;
      Diabetes Mellitus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Title of the project:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adjunctive Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBOT) for Lower Extremity Diabetic Ulcers: A&#xD;
      Prospective, Double-Blind, Randomized, Controlled Clinical Trial Background Diabetes Mellitus&#xD;
      is a major health problem with significant morbidity and mortality. The number of people with&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus worldwide is estimated at 285 million in 2010; and expected to increase to&#xD;
      438 million by 20301. In western countries, like the United Kingdom, diabetic foot ulcers are&#xD;
      the most commonly found chronic wound2. A diabetic foot ulcer is defined as a 'full&#xD;
      thickness' lesion of the skin, that is, a wound penetrating through the dermis below the&#xD;
      ankle joint3. The lifetime risk of developing foot ulcers in diabetics is estimated to be&#xD;
      15%4. These ulcers may heal with proper wound care, but some may become chronic and others&#xD;
      may lead to amputation. These different outcomes are influenced by several risk factors&#xD;
      including, among others, peripheral arterial disease (ischemia), peripheral neuropathy,&#xD;
      mechanical foot deformity, poor foot care and inappropriate shoe wear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetic foot ulcers are associated with high risk of amputation. About 50% of patients&#xD;
      undergoing non-traumatic lower limb amputations are diabetics5. The 5-year amputation rate is&#xD;
      estimated to be 19% with a mean time to amputation 58 months since the onset of an diabetic&#xD;
      foot ulcer6.Because infection and tissue hypoxia are the major contributing factors for&#xD;
      non-healing diabetic foot ulcers, hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) carries a potential benefit&#xD;
      for treating these problematic wounds that do not respond to standard therapy7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vascular: Approximately 35% of diabetic foot ulcers result from peripheral vasculopathy with&#xD;
      an additional 15-20% caused by mixed neuropathic-vasculopathic pathology8. There is an&#xD;
      accelerated development of atherosclerosis in the distal arteries (tibial and peroneal&#xD;
      arteries) of diabetic patients with the dorsalis pedis artery often spared. Abnormal smooth&#xD;
      muscle tone and decreased perfusion exacerbate these changes. On a macrovascular level,&#xD;
      thickening of the basement membrane and abnormal endothelial function is often found. Tissue&#xD;
      ischemia may be worsened by capillary thrombosis and by impaired neurogenic control.9 The&#xD;
      microcirculation of diabetic patients exhibits characteristic structural changes such as the&#xD;
      reduction in the size of capillaries and thickening in basement membrane that impairs the&#xD;
      normal hyperemic or vasodilatory response to injury10, 11 and interferes with transportation&#xD;
      of nutrients and oxygen. Arterial thrombosis commonly develops in the presence of&#xD;
      pre-existing atherosclerotic 2 changes in the vascular endothelium, as a result of low blood&#xD;
      flow and increased blood viscosity or a pro-coagulative state. All of these changes are&#xD;
      exacerbated by a smoking habit (cigarettes, cigars or water pipes) by inducing peripheral&#xD;
      vasoconstriction that reduces available oxygen to tissue by 20-30% per cigarette for one&#xD;
      hour.12 It induces alterations in lipid metabolism, increases platelet aggregation, and&#xD;
      increase blood viscosity.12 Pressure: Peripheral neuropathy is the most common cause of foot&#xD;
      ulcers and is present in 78% of the ulcer formation pathway.8 Foot deformity is the most&#xD;
      common underlying cause and that is leading to unequal pressure redistribution and subsequent&#xD;
      ulceration. Poor glycemic control and poor glycemic control increase the risk of neuropathy&#xD;
      and is directly linked to the duration of living with diabetes (&gt;15 years carrying a higher&#xD;
      risk for developing neuropathy13), manifesting in all three components of the nervous system&#xD;
      (autonomic, motor and sensory).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Autonomic neuropathy of the foot results in loss of sweat and oil gland function leading to&#xD;
      dry cracked skin prone to bacterial infections; the loss of sympathetic vascular tone that&#xD;
      leads to vasodilatation and the development of edema8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor neuropathy causes loss of nerve supply to the intrinsic foot muscles with subsequent&#xD;
      imbalance of the long flexor and extensor tendons. This produces an anatomic foot deformity&#xD;
      with hyperextension of the toes, dropdown of the metatarsal heads and distal movement of the&#xD;
      protective fat pad leading to pressure imbalance, callus formation and underlying skin&#xD;
      breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In sensory neuropathy the loss of the protective components of the foot is rendering patients&#xD;
      unaware of repeated traumas and small injury as a pain response is absent. A wound remain&#xD;
      undetected, worsen, becomes secondarily infected with the patient usually late in presenting&#xD;
      to formal health care, adding to the severity of the foot condition on assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The role of oxygen in the wound healing cascade and subsequent combatting action against&#xD;
      bacterial invasion, especially anaerobes, is well documented.14 Delayed or arrested healing&#xD;
      and the development of infection is a direct result from decreased perfusion and poor&#xD;
      oxygenation of tissue.15 The presence of wound hypoxia is an major etiological pathway in the&#xD;
      development of chronic non-healing diabetic foot ulcers.16&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of tissue oxygenation is done with transcutaneous oximetry (TcPO2) and provides a&#xD;
      simple, noninvasive diagnostic technique for an objective assessment of local tissue&#xD;
      perfusion and oxygenation.17 TcPO2 measurements are frequently used in the assessment of&#xD;
      diabetic ulcers to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assess the severity of tissue hypoxia;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine a saturation response to 100% oxygen;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Serve as a predictor for response to HBO therapy;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Provide a guideline on when to stop therapy; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Define healable levels for lower limb amputation18. Studies have shown that an achieved&#xD;
           value below 40 mmHg on breathing normal air, is associated with poor healing of diabetic&#xD;
           foot ulcers adding to amputation risk, while values higher than 40 mmHg is likely to&#xD;
           yield spontaneous resolution of foot ulcers.19 Saturated TcPO2 values (breathing 100%&#xD;
           oxygen via a non-rebreather mask for 15 minutes) that exceeds a cutoff value of 200&#xD;
           mmHg, is associated with a positive predictive value to the extent of 74% for wound&#xD;
           healing improvement, or limb salvage following a therapeutic course of hyperbaric oxygen&#xD;
           therapy.20 Level 1A evidence of the beneficial effect of HBO therapy on diabetic foot&#xD;
           outcomes was initially scant with only two prospective RCT studies available before&#xD;
           2000.21, 22 One study was added in 200323 and 3 then a gap existed that was only filled&#xD;
           in 201324 due to the difficulties associated with a trial using HBO as adjunctive&#xD;
           modality. All of these studies have shown efficacy of HBO with the systematic review&#xD;
           from Liu et al in 201325 showing a reduction of major limb amputations (minor&#xD;
           amputations though present) and establishing a foundation for wound healing to progress&#xD;
           (neovascularization and granulation stimulation). The retrospective cohort study of&#xD;
           Margolis et al26 though, has disproved the effectiveness of HBO as modality in&#xD;
           management of diabetic foot ulcers. Major limitations were identified on doing a&#xD;
           systematic critique27 of that study with design, sample selection with inappropriate&#xD;
           inclusions, unequal study arms, statistical usage of a propensity score to adjust for&#xD;
           wound severity and unclear expected endpoints the most prevalent. This study has&#xD;
           highlighted the difference between effectiveness (if something has been beneficially&#xD;
           employed in the day to day setting) and efficacy (does it work) and that is the answer&#xD;
           would like to provide with an effectiveness study in a prospective, rather than&#xD;
           retrospective design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives of the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study aim and objectives The aim of this study is to determine the effectiveness of 30&#xD;
      sessions of adjunctive hyperbaric oxygen therapy on the healing rate of diabetic lower&#xD;
      extremity ulcers.&#xD;
&#xD;

      three dimensional photography Time to achieve 80% wound surface reduction as measured by the&#xD;
      Silhouette trajectory Time to achieve bipedal ambulation on an offloading device crossing the&#xD;
      ankle joint The level of neovascularization achieved as measured by transcutaneous oximetry&#xD;
      The proportion of patients ending up with a below knee amputation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determine the TCpO2 criteria by which treatment response could be measured.Determine the&#xD;
      TCpO2 criteria by which optimal treatment is assessed (to indicate completion of therapy).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluate the role of minor amputations (one or more toes up to the mid foot) in saving the&#xD;
      major limb (integrity of the knee and ankle joint) Evaluate the role of HBO in resolution of&#xD;
      infection/osteomyelitis in conjunction with appropriate systemic antibiotics.&#xD;
