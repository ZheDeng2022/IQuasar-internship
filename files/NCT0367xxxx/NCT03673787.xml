  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a single centre, proof-of-concept phase I trial of atezolizumab in combination with&#xD;
      ipatasertib. There are two parts to this study, the dose escalation phase (Part A) and the&#xD;
      dose expansion phase (Part B). Part A, will determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and&#xD;
      recommended Phase II dose (RP2D). This will be followed by the Part B dose expansion phase to&#xD;
      further characterise the safety and tolerability and to assess the pharmacodynamic activity&#xD;
      of the combination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 trial of atezolizumab in combination with ipatasertib. There are two parts&#xD;
      to this study. Part A: dose escalation, and Part B: dose expansion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will investigate the combination of a fixed dose of atezolizumab (1200mg)&#xD;
      in combination with escalating doses of ipatasertib in patients with advanced solid tumours&#xD;
      (Cohort A1) and patients with resectable glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) (Cohort A2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A1 (advanced solid tumours):&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an ipatasertib run-in phase of 14 days of continuous oral dosing with paired&#xD;
      pre and post-treatment blood and tissue samples. Combinations dosing will commence on Cycle 1&#xD;
      Day 1 with the atezolizumab infusion. Cycle 1 will therefore be 35 days. Only patients with&#xD;
      advanced solid tumours recruited into Cohort A1 will be included in dose escalation decisions&#xD;
      and determination of the MTD and recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) for part B.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort A2 (potentially resectable GBMs):&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be an ipatasertib run-in phase of at least 14 days and up to 21 days followed by&#xD;
      surgical resection of the patient's tumour (5 day window for surgery). Ipatasertib dosing&#xD;
      will be stopped 48 hours prior to surgery and combination dosing on Cycle1Day1 (C1D1) will&#xD;
      commence after recovery. Accrual to Cohort A2 will run in parallel Cohort A1 without formal&#xD;
      dose escalations and patients in Cohort A2 will not be included in dose escalation decisions&#xD;
      for Cohort A1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled into the expansion phase (Part B) to further characterize the&#xD;
      tolerability of the RP2D (established in Cohort A1) of the combination in specific subgroups&#xD;
      of patients. Part B of the study will have a pre-screening component for patients with solid&#xD;
      tumours (Cohorts B1 and B2) to allow for enrichment for these specific subgroups of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B of the study will have three cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B1: patients with solid tumours with hyperactivation of PI3K pathway as&#xD;
           determined by pathogenic mutations identified by next generation sequencing (NGS) (eg&#xD;
           known activating mutations in PIK3CA, AKT1, AKT2) or PTEN loss (assessed by&#xD;
           immunohistochemistry (IHC) (n=12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B2: patients with castrate-resistant prostate cancer with PTEN loss as assessed&#xD;
           by IHC (n=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B3: patients with glioblastoma (n=12) of which at least three (n=3) patients will&#xD;
           have potentially resectable recurrent glioblastomas.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B4: patients with melanoma post progression on immune-checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
           (n=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B5: patients with other tumour types refractory to immune checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
           (where immune checkpoint inhibitors are licensed, e.g. bladder cancer, head and neck&#xD;
           SCC, NSCLC) (n=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort B6: patients with gynaecological cancers (including ovarian cancer, cervical&#xD;
           cancer, endometrial cancer) (n=12)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Approximately 12 patients with solid tumours and 3 patients with glioblastoma will be entered&#xD;
      into Part A of this trial and a further 72 patients will be enrolled into part B of the trial&#xD;
      for an expected maximum of 87 patients on the study. If the MTD is reached in Part A with&#xD;
      less than 15 patients enrolled, the investigators may enrol further patients at the R2PD in&#xD;
      Part A to a maximum of 15 patients to include sufficient numbers of patients for the&#xD;
      proof-of-concept translational studies. Additional subjects may be enrolled in a given cohort&#xD;
      to ensure that the required number of evaluable subjects in each cohort is achieved.&#xD;
