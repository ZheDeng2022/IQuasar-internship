  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal is to document efficacy of PF-SCS therapy in a blinded fashion and better understand&#xD;
      how SCS therapy works in the clinical setting. Overall the investigators hope to improve&#xD;
      patient care and selection of candidates who have the best potential for effective pain&#xD;
      relief from an expensive and invasive therapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The PF-SCS has 3 programs (P1, P2, P3) that can be used. At Visit 1, the study physician will&#xD;
      review the PF-SCS program that the participant has been using. This program is known as the&#xD;
      optimal program (OPP) and will be known as P1. The study physician will then designate the&#xD;
      other two programs (P2 and P3); one of them will be identical to the OPP (P1) and the other&#xD;
      program will be the LAP. The participant will be unaware if the LAP is assigned to P2 or P3.&#xD;
      At the end of Visit 1, the study physician will have the participant switch from P1 to the&#xD;
      LAP (P2 or P3). The participant will be reassured that if their pain returns after they&#xD;
      switch programs, they can immediately call the study physician and will be switched back to&#xD;
      the previous OPP (P1) without delay. The participants whose pain returns will be categorized&#xD;
      as Group 1. The physician will document the time that had elapsed before their pain returned.&#xD;
      This time will be considered as &quot;carry over time&quot; (COT) from PF-SCS. Only the study&#xD;
      physicians will be aware of the programming parameters for P2 and P3. The rest of the study&#xD;
      staff and participants will be blinded and will not be aware of the programming parameters&#xD;
      for P2 and P3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants whose pain remains stable while on the LAP will be categorized as Group 2.&#xD;
      All participants will keep a daily diary for pain intensity, sleep and any other concerns&#xD;
      that may arise related to the change of program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of Visit 1, a member of the study team will schedule Visit 2, between 14 to 28&#xD;
      days from Visit 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phone call: A study physician will call subjects between 7-14 days after Visit 1. Group 1&#xD;
      participants will be asked to switch to the LAP (P2 or P3) before Visit 2. To minimize the&#xD;
      duration of the LAP, Visit 2 will be scheduled within six hours from the end of COT. The&#xD;
      Group 2 participants will attend Visit 2 without changing their LAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Visit 2, participants will fill out questionnaires on pain intensity, sleep, activities&#xD;
      and global impression. A blinded study staff will perform QST on the subject. At the end of&#xD;
      Visit 2, Group 1 participants will be instructed to go back to the OPP (P1). At the end of&#xD;
      Visit 2, Group 2 will be allowed to switch back to the OPP (P1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will use quantitative sensory testing (QST) as a tool to objectively&#xD;
      quantify the impact of SCS on heat pain threshold, heat pain tolerance and wind-up over the&#xD;
      painful area and compare this with a non-painful area in each subject. QST will be performed&#xD;
      at Visit 1 and Visit 2.&#xD;
