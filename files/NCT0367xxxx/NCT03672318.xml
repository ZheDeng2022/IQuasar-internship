  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The body has different ways of fighting infection and disease. No single way seems perfect&#xD;
      for fighting cancer. This research study combines two different ways of fighting disease:&#xD;
      antibodies and T cells. Antibodies are proteins that protect the body from disease caused by&#xD;
      bacteria or toxic substances. Antibodies work by binding those bacteria or substances, which&#xD;
      stops them from growing and causing bad effects. T cells, also called T lymphocytes, are&#xD;
      special infection-fighting blood cells that can kill other cells, including tumor cells or&#xD;
      cells that are infected. Both antibodies and T cells have been used to treat patients with&#xD;
      cancers. They both have shown promise, but neither alone has been sufficient to cure most&#xD;
      patients. This study is designed to combine both T cells and antibodies to create a more&#xD;
      effective treatment. The treatment that is being researched is called autologous T lymphocyte&#xD;
      chimeric antigen receptor cells targeted against the CD138 antigen (CAR138 T cells).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In previous studies, it has been shown that a new gene can be put into T cells that will&#xD;
      increase their ability to recognize and kill cancer cells. A gene is a unit of DNA. Genes&#xD;
      make up the chemical structure carrying the patient's genetic information that may determine&#xD;
      human characteristics (i.e., eye color, height and sex). The new gene that is put in the T&#xD;
      cells in this study makes a piece of an antibody called anti-CD138. This antibody floats&#xD;
      around in the blood and can detect and stick to cancer cells called multiple myeloma cells&#xD;
      because they have a substance on the outside of the cells called CD138. Anti-CD138 antibodies&#xD;
      have been used to treat people with multiple myeloma, but have not been strong enough to cure&#xD;
      most patients. For this study, the anti-CD138 antibody has been changed so that instead of&#xD;
      floating free in the blood part of it is now joined to the T cells. Only the part of the&#xD;
      antibody that sticks to the multiple myeloma cells is attached to the T cells instead of the&#xD;
      entire antibody. When an antibody is joined to a T cell in this way it is called a chimeric&#xD;
      receptor. These CD138 chimeric (combination) receptor-activated T cells seem to kill some of&#xD;
      the tumor, but they do not last very long in the body and so their chances of fighting the&#xD;
      cancer are unknown.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Cell Procurement Up to 300 mL total of peripheral blood (up to 3 collections) will be&#xD;
      obtained from patients for cell procurement. In patients with a low CD3 count in the&#xD;
      peripheral blood (less than 200/μl by flow cytometry), a leukopheresis may be performed to&#xD;
      isolate sufficient T-cells. The parameters for pheresis will be 2 blood volumes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CAR138 T-cell Administration Autologous CAR138 T-cells will be administered 2-14 days&#xD;
      following lymphodepletion. The lymphodepletion regimen will consist of Cyclophosphamide 300&#xD;
      mg/m^2 and Fludarabine 30 mg/m^2 IV each given daily over 3 consecutive days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Therapy Autologous CAR138 T-cells will be administered 2-14 days following&#xD;
      lymphodepletion with cyclophosphamide and fludarabine by a licensed provider (oncology&#xD;
      registered nurse or physician) via intravenous injection over 5-10 minutes through either a&#xD;
      peripheral or central line. The expected volume is 1-50cc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment with one infusion will be administered unless:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient decides to withdraw from the study, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General or specific changes in the patient's condition render the patient unacceptable&#xD;
           for further treatment in the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of Follow-up Patients will be followed for up to 15 years for replication-competent&#xD;
      retrovirus evaluation or until death, whichever occurs first. Patients removed from study for&#xD;
      unacceptable adverse events will continue follow up for evaluation of progression free&#xD;
      survival, overall survival and replication-competent retrovirus monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who experience disease progression after receiving a cell infusion will still be&#xD;
      required to complete abbreviated follow up procedures.&#xD;

    <time_frame>4 weeks from infusion of the CAR138 T cells</time_frame>
    <description>The maximum tolerated dose will be determined through assessment of dose limiting toxicity (DLT) experienced during the safety evaluation period. Severity and categorization of adverse events will be determined in accordance with the National Cancer Institute's Common Terminology for Adverse Events (CTCAE, version 5.0). A DLT is defined as any of the following that may, after consultation with the FDA, be considered possibly, probably, or definitely related to the study cellular products: Grade 3 and 4 cytokine release syndrome (CRS) that persists beyond 72 hours, or any Grade 5 CRS event; Grade 4 neutropenia or thrombocytopenia lasting more than 28 days from the time of CAR138 T-cell infusion. Any other ≥ Grade 3 non- hematologic toxicity (exceptions include: alopecia; grade 3 electrolyte abnormalities, hyperglycemia, diarrhea, or nausea and vomiting that can be managed with supportive care and do not persist as Grade 3 toxicities for &gt; 72 hours)).</description>

        infection will be used to generate transduced cells). Note: To meet eligibility, patients&#xD;
        are required to be negative for HIV antibody or HIV viral load, negative for HTLV1 and 2&#xD;
        antibody or PCR negative for HTLV1 and 2, negative for Hepatitis B surface antigen, and&#xD;
        negative for HCV antibody or HCV viral load.&#xD;
&#xD;

        of Analysis (CofA) acceptance criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must have stopped taking corticosteroids for at least 48 hours prior to&#xD;
        lymphodepleting chemotherapy; (those receiving &lt;10mg/day prednisone equivalent may be&#xD;
        enrolled at discretion of the Investigator)&#xD;
&#xD;

        lymphodepletion. If markers of measurable disease no longer fall within the guidelines&#xD;
        outlined above (procurement eligibility criterion #5), the Principal Investigator should be&#xD;
        contacted. In such an event, the patient may be allowed to receive lymphodepletion and&#xD;
        CAR138 T-cell infusion if it is felt to be in the patient's best interests. The patient&#xD;
        would not be evaluable for response (disease not measurable) but would be evaluable for all&#xD;
        other safety and efficacy measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients must demonstrate adequate organ function prior to lymphodepletion as defined&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pulse oximetry: ≥92% on room air&#xD;
&#xD;
        Has not received treatment with any investigational drug within 21 days or any tumor&#xD;
        vaccines within the previous six weeks prior to lymphodepletion.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
        Negative serum pregnancy test within 72 hours prior to lymphodepleting therapy for female&#xD;
        participants of childbearing potential. NOTE: Females are considered of childbearing&#xD;
        potential unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral&#xD;
        tubal ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at&#xD;
        least 12 consecutive months.&#xD;
