  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity related ailments, such as cardiovascular diseases (CVD) and metabolic disorders are&#xD;
      major causes of death in the Western World. The proposed research may result in improved&#xD;
      prevention, diagnosis and treatments of obesity and obesity-related disorders. Recently&#xD;
      published data show that if a weight is carried by a rodent, this animal will lose body&#xD;
      weight and gain an improved glucose control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We aim to confirm these findings in a human model. We plan to let obese subjects carry weight&#xD;
      vests and monitor their change in body weight. We will also measure appetite, physical&#xD;
      activity and insulin sensitivity to further examine the potential beneficial effects of&#xD;
      loading. Blood sampling will be performed to investigate the mechanism of action.&#xD;

      STUDY OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if wearing a weight vest with 11 % of an individual's body weight for 3 weeks&#xD;
      decreases body weight in obese study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if wearing a weight vest with 11 % of an individual's body weight for 3 weeks&#xD;
      affects fat mass, bone mass, muscle mass, water mass, fat free mass, physical activity and&#xD;
      food intake in obese study subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To determine if wearing a weight vest with 11 % of an individual's body weight for 3 weeks&#xD;
      affects plasma concentrations of glucose, insulin, HDL, LDL, TAG, FGF21, osteocalcin, FGF23,&#xD;
      FGF15, sclerostin, lipocalin-2, leptin, ghrelin, GLP-1, GLP-2, CCK, (3-36)PYY, glucagon,&#xD;
      renin, methoxynorepinephrine, Na, K, Cl, Ca and creatinine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN AND PROCEDURES&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall study design and procedure protocol&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the study is to investigate the effect of adding synthetic weights to obese&#xD;
      individuals. The weights will be added as a weight vest with 11 % of the individual's body&#xD;
      weight and will be worn for three weeks. Half of the study subjects will be given a weight&#xD;
      vest with 11 % of body weight and half of the study subjects will be given a light weight&#xD;
      vest. The light weight vest consists of a weight vest with most of the weights removed. The&#xD;
      weight of the light vest will be 1 % of body weight giving a difference of 10 % between the&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body weight, fat mass, bone mass, water mass and fat free mass will be measured before and&#xD;
      after the intervention by medical personnel to determine the effect of added synthetic&#xD;
      weights on obese subject. This will be measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA)&#xD;
      (MC-180MA, Tanita). The scales will be calibrated every week during the study to make certain&#xD;
      reliable measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pedometers will be used to measure the subject's activity each study day. We will also&#xD;
      encourage the study participants to report food intake, choice of food and level of hunger&#xD;
      each week. This will be done using the validated poll MiniMealQ(9). A pedometer will also be&#xD;
      attached to the vests to check the daily use of the vests. The study persons will be informed&#xD;
      about this arrangement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood sampling will be performed before and after the intervention to further&#xD;
      determine the effects of adding synthetic weights to obese individuals but also to elucidate&#xD;
      the mechanism behind the &quot;gravitostat&quot;. Blood glucose levels will be measured immediately.&#xD;
      Blood samples, except blood glucose, will be analyzed either continuous or after all study&#xD;
      subjects have been enrolled depending on human resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be recruited by advertising in the local newspaper. Study subjects will&#xD;
      be informed about hypothesis that people carrying a heavy or light weight may differ in&#xD;
      weight loss. At this point it is not known if the heavy weight vest or the light vest is&#xD;
      causing more weight loss, as no one has performed similar studies on humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will have one week to familiarize themselves with the equipment used in the&#xD;
      study before the intervention starts. This is to minimize human errors during the&#xD;
      intervention and ensure a high level of compliance. The data collected during this week will&#xD;
      be used as baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1 - enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 100 persons to contact the researchers will be enrolled in the study. In order to&#xD;
      be enrolled a study subject also need to meet all the inclusion criteria and not meet any of&#xD;
      the exclusion criteria. The study subjects will be entitled to a private meeting with one of&#xD;
      the researchers. Study subjects will receive information about the study plan both orally and&#xD;
      written during this meeting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consumption of more than one liter of wine (11 %) or alcohol equivalent during a study week&#xD;
      will not be accepted. Drastic change in lifestyle before or during the study will not be&#xD;
      accepted. Any study subject failing to comply with this restriction will instantly be removed&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Education and detailed planning of the study subjects will be performed after written consent&#xD;
      is obtained from the study subject. Body weight, fat mass, bone mass, water mass and fat free&#xD;
      mass will be measured using BIA. It is unlikely that bone mass and water mass will be&#xD;
      affected during the short time of this study but these values are easily obtained during the&#xD;
      measurements. We will also measure blood pressure, height in order to calculate BMI and&#xD;
      collect each subject's age and gender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This meeting will end with a blood sample to screen for common diseases that may distort the&#xD;
      results and increase the risk of adverse effects. We will measure the following substances in&#xD;
      blood: hemoglobin, white blood cells, trombocytes, sodium, potassium, creatinine, ASAT, ALAT,&#xD;
      HbA1c, C-reactive protein (CRP), T4, TSH. Also, we will use urine dipsticks to further screen&#xD;
      for diseases. We will measure the following substances in urine: nitrite, white blood cells,&#xD;
      red blood cells, glucose, creatinine and albumin. Only subjects were all above substances are&#xD;
      within normal levels will be included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subject will be able to contact the researchers by e-mail or mobile phone any time&#xD;
      during the study if questions arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 8 - intervention starts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be entitled to another appointment with the researchers and the nurse&#xD;
      from Gothia Forum one week after the enrollment. Body weight, fat mass, bone mass, fat free&#xD;
      mass and water mass will be measured during this meeting using BIA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fasting blood sampling by an experienced nurse from Gothia Forum will be performed when the&#xD;
      researcher believe that the study subject is fully educated and ready to be enrolled in the&#xD;
      study. A maximum of 25 ml will be collected at each blood sampling. Plasma levels of glucose&#xD;
      will be measured instantly in capillary blood, and thus not be dependent on successful venous&#xD;
      blood sampling. Venous blood samples for other measurement than glucose will be centrifuged&#xD;
      by the researchers or personnel from Gothia Forum to obtain serum or EDTA plasma samples.&#xD;
      Serum and plasma samples may be stored at a temperature of -80°C until analysis. Study&#xD;
      subjects can request to have their blood samples destroyed at any time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention will start directly after blood sampling. Subjects will earn a randomized&#xD;
      three character code to be used throughout the study; this will be noted in a digital only&#xD;
      randomization list. Study subjects will obtain either a weight vest with 11 % of body weight&#xD;
      or a light vest weighing 1 % of body weight. The vest is to be worn 8 hours each day for the&#xD;
      following 3 weeks. The vest is only to be used during awake hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 15&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be entitled to another appointment with the researchers two weeks after&#xD;
      the enrollment, this appointment may be performed by telephone if the subject so agree. Any&#xD;
      problems with compliance will be discussed. Study subjects who deviate more than 20 % from&#xD;
      the study protocol will be removed from the study. Study subjects will continue to wear the&#xD;
      vests for 8 hours each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 22&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be entitled to another appointment with the researchers three weeks after&#xD;
      the enrollment, this appointment may be performed by telephone if the subject so agree. Any&#xD;
      problems with compliance will be discussed. Study subjects who deviate more than 20 % from&#xD;
      the study protocol will be removed from the study. Study subjects will continue to wear the&#xD;
      vests for 8 hours each day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 29 - intervention ends&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study subjects will be entitled to another appointment in the morning before breakfast with&#xD;
      the researchers and the nurse from Gothia Forum four weeks after the enrollment. Body weight,&#xD;
      fat mass, bone mass, fat free mass and water mass will be measured during this meeting using&#xD;
      BIA. Fasting glucose will be measured in capillary blood. Venous blood sampling will be done.&#xD;
      Study subjects will have worn the vests for 8 hours the day before, but they will not wear it&#xD;
      during the visit the morning of day 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The appointment at day 29 may also be performed on &quot;day 30&quot; depending on the study subject's&#xD;
      schedule. Nevertheless, last day for the intervention is on study day 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale for study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to avoid the risk of carry-over effects, we have decided to not use a crossover&#xD;
      design. This could have decreased the variation of the measurement values and increased the&#xD;
      power of the study. However, we believe there could be a risk of a carry-over effect with a&#xD;
      cross over design. As this is a completely new effect in clinical studies, we have no&#xD;
      information about the wash-out time needed to avoid this problem.&#xD;
