      This is a multi-center, prospective, non-controlled post market surveillance study. The&#xD;
      objectives of this study are to obtain survival and outcome data on the Allofit IT Shell in&#xD;
      combination with the BIOLOX® delta Taper Liner when used in primary total hip arthroplasty.&#xD;

      The objectives of this study are to obtain survival and outcome data on the Allofit IT Shell&#xD;
      in combination with the BIOLOX® delta Taper Liner when used in primary total hip&#xD;
      arthroplasty.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be done by analysis of standard scoring systems, radiographs and adverse event&#xD;
      records. Data will be used to monitor pain, mobility and survivorship, and to confirm the&#xD;
      safety and performance of the Allofit IT Ceramic Bearing System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 200 patients will be enrolled in this study that will last 12 years (2 year&#xD;
      enrollment plus 10 years follow-up) with the following visits at 6 months, 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, and&#xD;
      10 years post-operatively.&#xD;

    <measure>&quot;Harris Hip Score&quot; is a SINGLE form to measure the functional outcome of the patient.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The Harris Hip Score is a questionnaire filled by the surgeon with the patient who received a hip implant. The domains covered are: pain (44 points), function (47 points), range of motion (5 points), and absence of deformity (4 points). Patients select a discrete set of answers which correspond to predefined point allocations based on the category. To obtain a final score, these values are summed. The scale then ranges as Excellent: 90 - 100, Good: 80 - 89, Fair: 70 - 79, Poor: &lt; 70.</description>

    <measure>&quot;EQ-5D&quot; is a SINGLE form to measure the quality-of-life of the patient.</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The EQ-5D measures 5 dimensions; mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, and anxiety/depression, with a total of 5 questions.</description>

    <measure>Subject quality-of-life determined by the SF-12 score</measure>
    <time_frame>10 years post-surgery</time_frame>
    <description>The SF-12 is a 12-item questionnaire in accordance with the &quot;quality of life&quot; questioning standards of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) Committee for Outcomes Research. The questions determine the patient's physical, emotional and social health and will be used to calculate a physical and mental functional score. This form is completed by the patient.</description>
