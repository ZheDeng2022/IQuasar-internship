  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity has become a significant health problem in Canada. When conservative efforts to lose&#xD;
      weight fail, bariatric surgical procedures are often considered. Today, the most common&#xD;
      bariatric procedures in North America are Laparoscopic Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (LRYGB) and&#xD;
      Laparoscopic Sleeve Gastrectomy (LSG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For many reasons, an initial bariatric procedure may require surgical revision. Some reasons&#xD;
      include weight regain, failed weight loss or other acute and chronic complications not&#xD;
      related to weight loss. In these cases, it may be indicated that a procedure be reversed inor&#xD;
      converted to another type of bariatric procedure. Regardless of the planned intervention,&#xD;
      revisional surgery is always more difficult than the initial procedure mainly due to surgical&#xD;
      scarring and altered anatomy. Though revisional bariatric surgery has been shown to be safe,&#xD;
      our hope is to improve the safety profile by utilizing robotic surgery. Robotic surgery can&#xD;
      facilitate more complex procedures by providing superior imaging and freedom of movement&#xD;
      during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to evaluate prospectively the outcomes of robotic compared to&#xD;
      laparoscopic revisional bariatric surgery in terms of perioperative outcomes such as&#xD;
      complication rates, operative time and readmissions as well as weight loss/comorbidity&#xD;
      resolution (diabetes, hypertension, sleep apnea) where applicable.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Revisional bariatric surgery is becoming increasingly commonplace in surgical practices.&#xD;
      Approximately 10-25% of patients bariatric surgery will require a revisional procedure at&#xD;
      some point after their initial operation. A conversion from one procedure to another can take&#xD;
      place as part of a planned two-step procedure or due to failed weight loss or weight regain&#xD;
      after the initial procedure. Furthermore, patients can require revision due to other acute&#xD;
      and chronic complications such as marginal ulcers, stenosis and nausea/vomiting. Though these&#xD;
      procedures are generally successful in their intended goal, it is been reported that&#xD;
      complication rates are higher after revision surgery the primary bariatric procedures.&#xD;
      Despite this, few studies have explored methods of increasing safety for revisional bariatric&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Robotic surgery is a tool that could potentially aid in the safety of revisional bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. Specific to bariatric surgery, the major strengths of robotic surgery is in&#xD;
      facilitating more complex surgical steps, such as a hand-sewn gastrojejunostomy, and&#xD;
      providing superior imaging and freedom of movement compared to traditional laparoscopy. While&#xD;
      these advantages may not confer major benefits in primary bariatric surgery, revisional&#xD;
      bariatric surgery often requires hand-sewn anastomoses in anatomical locations made more&#xD;
      difficult by previous surgical scarring and altered anatomy. This may also translate into a&#xD;
      long-term clinical and economic benefit which could offset the costs of robotics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite this potential, there have been relatively few studies that have investigated the use&#xD;
      of robotic assistance during revisional bariatric surgery and almost none with long-term&#xD;
      data. Furthermore, there is a paucity of high-quality research demonstrating any intervention&#xD;
      that increases safety during revisional bariatric surgery, including robotics. Considering&#xD;
      the current and future demand revisional bariatric surgery, there is a large potential role&#xD;
      for any interventions that can increase safety during these operations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to prospectively evaluate the difference between robotic and&#xD;
      laparoscopic revisional bariatric surgery in major surgical outcomes and metabolic outcomes,&#xD;
      where applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients seen in the bariatric clinic and judged to be potential candidates for revisional of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery will be screened as potential candidates for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants must meet all of the following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject previously met National Institutes of Health criteria for bariatric&#xD;
           surgery11 and received a bariatric surgical procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject is under consideration to undergo a revisional bariatric procedure after for&#xD;
           failed sustained weight loss, weight regain or other chronic issues requiring revision.&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  The subject must be willing and able to participate in the study procedures and to&#xD;
           understand and sign the informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who meet any of the following criteria at the time of the baseline visit are NOT&#xD;
      eligible to be enrolled in this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject has a contraindication to general anesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The revision does not occur within the first 90 days of the initial bariatric procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject has any medical condition, which in the judgment of the Investigator and/or&#xD;
           designee makes the subject a poor candidate for the investigational procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject is a pregnant or lactating female (Women of child bearing potential must&#xD;
           take a pregnancy test prior to surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject has an history of alcohol abuse (&gt;30 g/day in men or &gt;20 g/day in women)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Any subject who is considered to be part of a vulnerable population (e.g. prisoners or&#xD;
           those with psychological concerns or those without sufficient mental capacity)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject is unable or unwilling to comply with the study requirements or follow-up&#xD;
           schedule&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject has conditions which, in the opinion of the investigator, will not be&#xD;
           appropriate for the study (e.g. severe cardiovascular disease, history of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal (GI) malignancy, history of upper GI surgery, open cholecystectomy,&#xD;
           history of intestinal surgery, immunosuppression, or non-ambulatory)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The subject has an estimated life expectancy of less than 6 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will have routine pre-operative bariatric clinic assessment. This includes,&#xD;
      among other things, complete medical history and physical exam, endoscopy, abdominal&#xD;
      ultrasound and blood tests. This involves the nurse, surgeon and internal medicine doctor&#xD;
      that will evaluate the patient regarding co-morbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective study will be able to start in January 2019 and will have a single surgeon&#xD;
      performing robotic revisional bariatric surgery at St. Joseph Healthcare. Robotic revisional&#xD;
      bariatric surgery will be performed according to the National Institutes of Health, as well&#xD;
      as the American College of Surgeons (ACS) and the American Society for Metabolic and&#xD;
      Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) guidelines. This study will include patients over 18 years-old who&#xD;
      have previously undergone bariatric surgery and a require revisional procedure. The&#xD;
      investigators will collect demographic data related to the patient such the age, gender,&#xD;
      weight, height, BMI, comorbidities such as hypertension, sleep apnea, hypertriglyceridemia,&#xD;
      hypercholesterolemia, type 2 diabetic (with or without insulin therapy). The investigators&#xD;
      will assess the operative time, the immediate postoperative complication rate according to&#xD;
      Dindo-Clavien classification, the mean length of hospital stay, the thirty-day readmission&#xD;
      rate, the thirty-day reoperation rate and the long-term reintervention rate. Follow-up of the&#xD;
      patients at 6 months, 1, 3 and 5 years, will be conducted as per usual through the bariatric&#xD;
      clinic where secondary outcomes will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will randomise 60 patients between robotic (30 patients) and laparoscopic&#xD;
      revisional bariatric surgery (30 patients) to evaluate those procedures in terms of&#xD;
      perioperative safety, weight loss and comorbidity resolution.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be approached for consent during their preoperative evaluation visits at the&#xD;
      Bariatric Clinic. Members of the study team will explain the study to the patient, answer&#xD;
      questions and will explain the informed consent form. Once all questions have been answered&#xD;
      to the patient's satisfaction, the patient will be asked to provide written informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once consent has been signed, the patient will be assigned to any of the two groups, using a&#xD;
      computer-based randomization on REDCap and the patient will be assigned to the corresponding&#xD;
      study arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will have all screening done before consent is signed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risk:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential risks of this study are related to surgery. The patient should not have any&#xD;
      increased risk when assigned to the study group robotic vs standard surgical treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed on an ongoing basis by the Principal Investigator. All adverse events&#xD;
      will be evaluated as they occur by the Principal Investigator to determine the study&#xD;
      continuance and to make any modifications to the procedure when necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical Complications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be defined by the Clavien-Dindo classification and our primary outcome will be&#xD;
      long-term complications higher than grade III:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade III: Requiring surgical, endoscopic or radiological intervention Grade III-a:&#xD;
      intervention not under general anesthesia Grade III-b: intervention under general anesthesia&#xD;
      Grade IV: Life-threatening complication (including CNS complications)‡ requiring&#xD;
      IC/ICU-management Grade IV-a: single organ dysfunction (including dialysis) Grade IV-b: multi&#xD;
      organ dysfunction Grade V: Death of a patient&#xD;
&#xD;
      Long-term reintervention rate:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reinterventions for chronic surgical complications will be assessed through the bariatric&#xD;
      clinic. Only complications related to the procedure, such as therapeutic endoscopy or&#xD;
      reoperation will be counted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence and remission of hypertension will be diagnosed by the definitions suggested in&#xD;
      2003 by the seventh report of the Joint National Committee (JNC 7) and are based upon the&#xD;
      average of two or more properly measured readings at each of two or more office visits after&#xD;
      an initial screen:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Normal blood pressure: systolic &lt;120 mmHg and diastolic &lt;80 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Prehypertension: systolic 120 to 139 mmHg or diastolic 80 to 89 mmHg (see&#xD;
           &quot;Prehypertension&quot;)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Hypertension:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stage 1: systolic 140 to 159 mmHg or diastolic 90 to 99 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Stage 2: systolic ≥160 mmHg or diastolic ≥100 mmHg&#xD;
&#xD;
      Type 2 diabetes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The presence and remission of type 2 diabetes will be diagnosed according to the American&#xD;
      Diabetes Association's current criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A1C ≥6.5 percent, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. FPG ≥126 mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L), OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Two-hour plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L) during an OGTT, OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. In a patient with classic symptoms of hyperglycemia or hyperglycemic crisis, a random&#xD;
           plasma glucose ≥200 mg/dL (11.1 mmol/L).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-surgical evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will undergo the standard bariatric postoperative evaluation including:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Appointments with the bariatric team (surgeon, internist, nurse, dietitian, social worker&#xD;
      and psychologist) at 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 1 year, and then on a&#xD;
      yearly basis until at least 5 years after date of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics (means, medians, standard deviations) will be used to characterize the&#xD;
      patient population where applicable. Chi square was used to analyze dichotomous patient&#xD;
      variables such as adverse events while continuous variables were analysed using T-tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our primary outcome will be any reintervention, readmission or grade 2, 3, 4 or 5&#xD;
      complication over the entire period of the study. Interim analysis will be done at years 1&#xD;
      and 3. Participants will be followed followed for the 5 years postoperatively. This study is&#xD;
      designed to assess a 50% reduction in time to the primary outcome, with p &lt;0.05 and 80% power&#xD;
      (assuming a major complication/reintervention rate of approximately 20% in the literature).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be evaluated using a hazard ratio and time-to-event analysis.&#xD;
      Kaplan-Meier curves will created for both groups and compared in a univariable manner using&#xD;
      the log rank test. Two Cox models will then created to assess the hazard ratio between the&#xD;
      treatment and control groups. The first will be a univariable model using treatment as the&#xD;
      only variable. A second, multivariable will be created to ascertain the effect of the&#xD;
      treatment after adjustment for important variable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary metabolic outcomes will be assessed using a log transformed generalized linear&#xD;
      model with robust confidence intervals for binary and continuous outcomes, where appropriate.&#xD;
      For binary outcomes, this provides the risk ratios for the effect estimate of robotic vs&#xD;
      laparoscopic approaches. Two regression models will be created to assess the differneces&#xD;
      between the treatment and control groups. The first will be a univariable model using&#xD;
      treatment as the only variable. A second, multivariable was created to ascertain the effect&#xD;
      of the treatment after adjustment for important variables that may not have been balanced&#xD;
      during randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monte Carlo Markov Chain estimation will be used for the regression models with 100,000&#xD;
      iterations after a 5,000 iteration burn-in. All chains were examined for convergence.&#xD;
      Statistical significance was set at p &lt; 0.05. Data were analyzed using Stata (StataCorp&#xD;
      version 12.1; College Station, TX) and MLwiN (Version 2.26; Centre for Multilevel Modelling,&#xD;
      University of Bristol).&#xD;
