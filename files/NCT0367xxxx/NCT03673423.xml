      Assess the degree of vascular involvement is crucial in the diagnostic and therapeutic&#xD;
      work-up of pancreatic cancer. NCCN resectability classification is used to stratify patients&#xD;
      (in resectable, borderline resectable and non resectable) and is based on contrast-enhanced&#xD;
      CT scan images. Unfortunately evaluation of imaging tests may rely on some degree of&#xD;
      subjective interpretation by observers implying a fundamental variation in patient's&#xD;
      treatments and an irreproducibility of different center study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter diagnostic study on interobserver agreement on the resectability of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer based upon NCCN criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study will be the assessment of interobserver variability to define&#xD;
      vascular invasion and resectability status on CT scans (according to the last version of the&#xD;
      NCCN Classification).&#xD;
&#xD;
      One hundred and thirty eight consecutive patients, able to produce an informed consent, from&#xD;
      18 years of age, with a non-metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma assessed by a&#xD;
      contrast-enhanced high-quality CT scan will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      69 CT scan studies provided by the centers involved (High volume for pancreatic surgery) will&#xD;
      be randomly selected from a pool of 138 of the patients that meet the inclusion criteria.&#xD;
      Each study will be independently reviewed by a senior radiologist and a senior surgeon of&#xD;
      each center, blinded to patient's clinical history and CT scan report, using NCCN definition&#xD;
      of respectability status. A CFR will be filled during the review and send to the study&#xD;
      coordinator. The data will be than centrally analyzed to asses interobserver agreement The&#xD;
      enrolment phase will last 6 months and the whole study will last 8 months.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Pancreatic adenocarcinoma frequently invades peripancreatic major vessels (common hepatic&#xD;
      artery, celiac axis, superior mesenteric artery and mesenteric-portal confluence), requiring&#xD;
      vascular resection or precluding the possibility of a radical resection. To Asses local&#xD;
      resectability in pancreatic cancer patients is a key step to the whole process of care and it&#xD;
      can change dramatically the outcomes. It is also extremely important in the reproducibility&#xD;
      of different scientific studies that stratified or included patients on this feature.&#xD;
      Resectability status classification of pancreatic adenocarcinoma, according to the definition&#xD;
      of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) is widely used in current surgical and&#xD;
      oncological practice to define the degree of vascular invasion: this classification describes&#xD;
      three different classes of tumor depending on the local extension and vascular involvement.&#xD;
      Resectable cancers are defined when no contact with the main vessels can be detected, whereas&#xD;
      borderline resectable and non resectable tumors have a different extent of vascular&#xD;
      infiltration. The recommended staging exam to define vascular involvement of pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma is contrast-enhanced CT scan; NCCN recommends that all patients with suspicion&#xD;
      of pancreatic adenocarcinoma have a dedicated pancreas protocol CT scan as part of the&#xD;
      initial assessment. From the attribution of a patient to a resectability class (resectable,&#xD;
      borderline resectable or non resectable) derives the choice of a specific therapeutic&#xD;
      pathway, as suggested by NCCN guidelines. International validated criteria to define local&#xD;
      respectability are available but they can be prone to subjective interpretation. An&#xD;
      evaluation of interobserver agreement on local resectability for pancreatic cancer in a&#xD;
      multicenter setting is needed to understand the reliability and reproducibility of this&#xD;
      system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary aim of the study will be the assessment of interobserver variability to define&#xD;
      vascular invasion and resectability status on CT scans (according to the last version of the&#xD;
      NCCN Classification).One senior radiologist and one senior surgeon from different Italian&#xD;
      high-volume Institutions will separately assess the degree of vascular invasion by pancreatic&#xD;
      cancer and the definition of resectability status according to NCCN. 69 CT scans, randomly&#xD;
      selected from a pool of 138 studies (provided by each center and collected by the study&#xD;
      coordinator) of non-metastatic consecutive patients with pancreatic cancers that signed the&#xD;
      informed consent, will be evaluated. CT scans will be provided by participating centres, that&#xD;
      will send them to the coordinating centre until reaching the planned enrolment. The images&#xD;
      and related DVDs will be made anonymous and identified just by serial number and initials of&#xD;
      the patient. The CT scan reports will be collected by each centre and made available by the&#xD;
      coordinating centre for subsequent analysis. The criteria used to define the resectability&#xD;
      status are those developed by the NCCN and included in the latest guidelines. Observers will&#xD;
      be blinded to the CT-scan reports, as well as to the clinical history of the patient, and to&#xD;
      the votes of the other raters. The degree of each vessel invasion and assignment of each&#xD;
      tumor to a category of resectability status (resectable - borderline resectable - non&#xD;
      resectable) will be defined separately by all raters, by fulfilling a template adopted and&#xD;
      reported in NCCN guidelines. An interrater reliability analysis using the Kappa statistic&#xD;
      will be performed to determine consistency among observers on the respectability status. The&#xD;
      consistency among observer will be also evaluated for each point of the criteria and section&#xD;
      of the template to asses vascular involvement in detail.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of significant fair or poor agreement (K &lt; 0.50), the participating raters (consensus&#xD;
      group), including the study coordinator, will meet to discuss the cases that will have less&#xD;
      than 100% agreement among all the raters. Scans will be reviewed, an open discussion ensued.&#xD;
      Based on the discussion, the consensus group will develop proposals to address the specific&#xD;
      areas of disagreement. The CT scans not select for the first evaluation will be than&#xD;
      evaluated, using the proposal of the consensus group by a new set of rater (one senior&#xD;
      radiologist and one senior surgeon from each institution involved) and the new Kappa&#xD;
      statistic will be calculated.&#xD;
