      REMIT-DM is a feasibility pilot study where participants will be recruited soon after their&#xD;
      diagnosis of type 2 diabetes to be placed immediately on insulin therapy for maximum of four&#xD;
      weeks with titrations of insulin guided by glucose levels and trends provided by a continuous&#xD;
      glucose monitor (CGM), with the purpose of achieving diabetes remission.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      REMIT-DM is a feasibility pilot study that aims to show that previously published diabetes&#xD;
      remission through early use and titration of short-term insulin therapy is possible and safe&#xD;
      in the ambulatory diverse American population of patients with T2D, with continuous glucose&#xD;
      level and trend information provided by CGM. We developed the algorithm based on published&#xD;
      diabetes remission studies and include within the algorithm the CGM trend arrows to further&#xD;
      refine insulin doses for both safety and efficacy purposes. Data captured by the CGM&#xD;
      transmits automatically to the cloud and is accessible at any time of day by the&#xD;
      multidisciplinary diabetes team, which includes the certified diabetes educator (CDE) and&#xD;
      Endocrinologist. The CGM-guided insulin titration algorithm is designed to achieve euglycemia&#xD;
      (defined as fasting CBG &lt; 100 mg/dL, and 2 hour post-prandial CBG &lt; 120 mg/dL) within 2 weeks&#xD;
      of initiating insulin therapy, then to help maintain euglycemia for 2 weeks before&#xD;
      discontinuing insulin entirely. Ten participants will undergo a maximum of 4 weeks of insulin&#xD;
      therapy and will be assessed for remission afterwards to confirm enough recovery of beta cell&#xD;
      function. (Complete remission is defined as fasting glycemia &lt;100 mg/dL without use of&#xD;
      pharmacological therapy.) Afterwards, we will implement American Diabetes Association (ADA)&#xD;
      guidelines for standard glycemic management, as necessary. We will use the data collected&#xD;
      during this feasibility study to sharpen the CGM-guided insulin titration algorithm for&#xD;
      creation of a T2DM remission mobile application that could then be tested and studied in a&#xD;
      larger sample size.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility study will also take into account clinically meaningful data points e.g. the&#xD;
      number of phone calls between the patient and the diabetes team, the patient experience, and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction.&#xD;

    <description>Administer the PAID-5 scale, which is a measure of diabetes distress. The scale ranges from a minimum of 0 (not a problem) to a maximum score of 4 (serious problem). The sum of the five questions provides the participant's score with a score range of minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 20. A total score of greater than or equal to 8 indicates possible diabetes related emotional distress, with a higher score indicating more significant distress. This will be given to participants to see if/how distress levels change via the intervention</description>

        <title>See if Diabetes Distress is Affected With Intervention Via Problem Areas In Diabetes (PAID) - 5 Questionnaire Scale</title>
        <description>Administer the PAID-5 scale, which is a measure of diabetes distress. The scale ranges from a minimum of 0 (not a problem) to a maximum score of 4 (serious problem). The sum of the five questions provides the participant's score with a score range of minimum score of 0 to a maximum score of 20. A total score of greater than or equal to 8 indicates possible diabetes related emotional distress, with a higher score indicating more significant distress. This will be given to participants to see if/how distress levels change via the intervention</description>
