  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The present study is a phase II, open label, single-center, non-randomized, single-dose&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty subjects in total will be enrolled at Weill Cornell Medical College (WCMC)/ NYPH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the ability of 89Zr-Df-IAB2M to detect localized,&#xD;
      clinically significant (defined as: ≥ 0.5 cm3 with Gleason pattern ≥ 4) prostate cancer&#xD;
      (PCa).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening period (up to 28 days), each subject will be scheduled to receive 10 mg&#xD;
      infusion of IAB2M conjugated with 2.5 mCi 89Zr-Df.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 - 4 days post-infusion, subjects will undergo a 89Zr-Df-IAB2M PET/CT scan. Images read by a&#xD;
      Nuc Med MD reporting: location, SUV and, if possible, size of all areas with abnormal uptake.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (they will also undergo a pelvic MRI if they have not obtained an MR image during the&#xD;
      screening period or on day of infusion)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Optional but recommended 68Ga-PSMA-HBED-CC (5±2mCi) injection and PET/CT scan (1 to 3 hours&#xD;
      after the injection) will also be performed prior to radical prostatectomy depending on&#xD;
      subject's availability and compliance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will undergo radical prostatectomy after completion of above imaging procedures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary endpoint of this study is the proportion of subjects with PSMA-positive&#xD;
      (identified by H&amp;E staining and immunohistochemistry) &quot;dominant&quot; PC lesion(s) greater than&#xD;
      5mm in diameter, whose lesion(s) have been successfully identified by 89Zr-Df-IAB2M imaging.&#xD;
      Because this is an exploratory pilot study, no formal sample size/power calculation is&#xD;
      required. However, with a sample size of 20 patients in the study, a two-sided 95% confidence&#xD;
      interval for the proportion of patients successfully imaged by 89Zr-Df-IAB2M can be&#xD;
      constructed to be within ± 19.0% of the observed proportion of patients with successful&#xD;
      imaging by 89Zr-Df-IAB2M. This calculation assumes an 89Zr-Df-IAB2M imaging-success&#xD;
      proportion of 75%. All estimates from the study will serve as preliminary data (i.e.,&#xD;
      hypothesis-generating) for future studies.&#xD;
