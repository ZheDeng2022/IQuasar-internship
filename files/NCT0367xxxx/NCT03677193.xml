  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The protocol aims to evaluate the feasibility and potential efficacy of an Interactive&#xD;
      Computer Play (ICP) intervention. The ICP intervention is built to help youth with Cerebral&#xD;
      palsy (CP) who have difficulty performing activities of daily living with their hand.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ICP intervention is a video game controlled by performing gestures with the non-dominant&#xD;
      hand. Using Low-cost commercial technology muscle activity and arm movement is used to&#xD;
      recognize the gestures which control the game. Players will get feedback in the game about&#xD;
      the quality of their movements through the built-in points and rewards system. This&#xD;
      repetitive practice and feedback will help the participants build strength and control in&#xD;
      their arm. To evaluate this ICP intervention, 10 participants, with hemiplegic CP and 8-18&#xD;
      years old, from Holland Bloorview will be recruited for a pilot feasibility study using a&#xD;
      single-case experimental design (SCED). The design is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Phase 1. Participants will speak with therapists / researchers in an Initial Dialogue&#xD;
           to:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Introduce the study/game and what it offers types of daily activities&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Set Performance goal areas (Canadian Occupational Performance Measure (COPM)), and&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Develop an action plan to facilitate the successful achievement of their goals.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Phase 2. Participants will perform baseline functional assessments including: active&#xD;
           range of motion (AROM), Assisting Hand Assessment (AHA), Box and Blocks Test (B&amp;B).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Phase 3. During the 4-week intervention, participants will play the ICP game from their&#xD;
           home according to the goals they define during the initial dialogue. This is expected to&#xD;
           be 20-30 min * 5 days per week. Once per week, participants will play the ICP&#xD;
           intervention with a researcher in clinic or at home who will also measure AROM while&#xD;
           recording the play session.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Phase 4. After the intervention, participants will complete clinical measures of&#xD;
           functional performance (AROM, AHA, B&amp;B) a final time and speak with therapist and&#xD;
           researcher to re-evaluate goals (COPM).&#xD;
&#xD;
      By leveraging the motivational and immersive aspects of ICP and combining it with&#xD;
      evidence-based movement feedback this protocol has the potential to improve home-based ICP&#xD;
      therapies for persons with CP.&#xD;
