    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a lung disorder commonly caused by smoking,&#xD;
      which makes breathing more difficult. When COPD patients exercise, they are not efficient&#xD;
      breathers and this leads to serious breathing difficulties, which often causes these patients&#xD;
      to stop exercise at low intensities. Even though patients with a mild form of COPD have&#xD;
      relatively well preserved lung function, they still have inefficient breathing during&#xD;
      exercise. The investigators think that these patients have problems exchanging fresh gas&#xD;
      (i.e., oxygen) into the blood stream because of poor lung blood vessel function. The&#xD;
      investigators will test whether inhaled medications, specifically nitric oxide, can improve&#xD;
      lung blood vessel function and decrease breathing difficulties during exercise. With this&#xD;
      research, the investigators will understand more about breathing efficiency and lung blood&#xD;
      vessel function in patients with COPD, and find out whether improving lung blood vessel&#xD;
      function helps COPD patients breathe easier and exercise longer. Understanding the reasons&#xD;
      behind the feeling of difficult breathing may lead to more effective therapy and improved&#xD;
      quality of life in COPD patients.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a respiratory disorder typically caused by&#xD;
      smoking and is characterized by airway obstruction. Exertional dyspnea (perceived&#xD;
      breathlessness) is a hallmark of COPD regardless of severity and is the primary reason for&#xD;
      exercise intolerance even in patients with mild COPD (defined using spirometric criteria as a&#xD;
      forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1)/forced vital capacity (FVC) &lt;0.70 and a FEV1 ≥ 80%).&#xD;
      Dyspnea in COPD has been shown to profoundly reduce patient quality of life, physical&#xD;
      activity, and impair patients' ability to complete day-to-day tasks. Previous work in mild&#xD;
      COPD has demonstrated that exertional dyspnea is the result of increased work of breathing&#xD;
      during exercise, and that this increased work of breathing comes from: 1) an exaggerated&#xD;
      ventilatory response to exercise (i.e. increased minute ventilation relative to carbon&#xD;
      dioxide production, V̇E/V̇CO2), and 2) airflow limitation (i.e. expiratory flow limitation&#xD;
      and resulting dynamic hyperinflation). A great deal of work has focused on improving airflow&#xD;
      limitation in COPD; however, very little has been done to understand and treat the&#xD;
      exaggerated ventilatory response to exercise in COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several previous studies in COPD have consistently shown an elevated ventilatory response&#xD;
      (i.e. greater V̇E/V̇CO2) during exercise. The elevated V̇E/V̇CO2 response to exercise appears&#xD;
      to be clinically important, as it independently predicts mortality in COPD and indicates that&#xD;
      physiological abnormalities beyond airflow obstruction are important in determining disease&#xD;
      severity, dyspnea, and risk of death. This increased V̇E/V̇CO2 in COPD appears to be&#xD;
      secondary to increased deadspace ventilation(i.e. sections of the lung with ventilation, but&#xD;
      no perfusion), and this increased deadspace ventilation results in a compensatory increase in&#xD;
      total minute ventilation (i.e. increased V̇E/V̇CO2) to maintain effective alveolar&#xD;
      ventilation and arterial blood gas homeostasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The underlying mechanism(s) for the increased deadspace ventilation and V̇E/V̇CO2 during&#xD;
      exercise in mild to moderate COPD is currently unclear; however, pulmonary microvascular&#xD;
      abnormalities and hypoperfusion of pulmonary capillaries are potential pathophysiologic&#xD;
      mechanisms. Mild to moderate COPD patients have reduced pulmonary microvascular blood flow in&#xD;
      nonemphysematous lung regions, which has led researchers to conclude that the low pulmonary&#xD;
      perfusion in an intact pulmonary vascular bed is likely the result of pulmonary vascular&#xD;
      dysfunction. Ventilation-perfusion (V̇A/Q̇) data in mild and moderate COPD shows substantial&#xD;
      V̇A/Q̇ inequality at rest, with the V̇A/Q̇ distribution skewed towards regions of high&#xD;
      V̇A/Q̇, which is indicative of increased deadspace. Consistent with this capillary&#xD;
      hypoperfusion hypothesis, our recent work has shown a blunted pulmonary capillary blood&#xD;
      volume response to exercise in mild COPD, when compared to age- and height-matched&#xD;
      non-smoking controls. Importantly, the low pulmonary capillary blood volume was associated&#xD;
      with increased V̇E/V̇CO2 during exercise, suggesting that low pulmonary perfusion (i.e.&#xD;
      reduced pulmonary capillary blood volume) leads to increased deadspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inhaled nitric oxide (NO) is commonly used to test for pulmonary vasodilatory responses in&#xD;
      patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), as it increases NO bioavailability and&#xD;
      improves pulmonary vascular function. Previous work in PAH and heart failure (HF) patients&#xD;
      has shown that standard doses (20-40 parts per million (ppm)) of inhaled NO can reduce&#xD;
      pulmonary vascular resistance and increase peak oxygen consumption (V̇O2peak). If inhaled NO&#xD;
      can reduce vascular dysfunction and increase perfusion in mild and moderate COPD, this would&#xD;
      result in a reduction in V̇E/V̇CO2 and improved exercise tolerance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PURPOSE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To examine the effect of inhaled NO on exercise capacity (V̇O2peak) ventilation and&#xD;
      dyspnea in in patents with COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Inhaled NO will improve exercise capacity, secondary to reduced V̇E/V̇CO2 and&#xD;
      dyspnea, in mild and moderate COPD, while no change will be observed in healthy controls and&#xD;
      severe COPD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design: Randomized double-blind cross-over design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will have a pulmonary function and cardiopulmonary exercise test. The study&#xD;
      procedure is briefly outlined below and is further outlined in the attached University&#xD;
      Hospital Foundation Grant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol: Seven sessions will be completed over a 3-week period in the following order:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 1) Participant enrollment, medical history, standard pulmonary function (PFT) and&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary exercise test (CPET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 2 &amp; 3) Randomly-ordered experimental CPETs while either breathing room air or inhaled&#xD;
      nitric oxide (room air with 40 ppm NO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Days 4 &amp; 5) Randomly-ordered constant load exercise tests, at 75% peak power output, while&#xD;
      either breathing room air or inhaled nitric oxide (room air with 40 ppm NO).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 6) Ultrasonography doppler measurements will be completed to determine pulmonary arterial&#xD;
      systolic pressure (at rest and during exercise) while breathing room air or inhaled nitric&#xD;
      oxide. Doppler measurements of systemic vascular endothelial function will be measured at&#xD;
      rest while breathing room air. To enhance doppler signal during the cardiac ultrasound,&#xD;
      agitated saline contrast will be used. A small sample of venous blood will be taken to&#xD;
      analyze inflammatory levels. Additionally, participants will breathe into a small tube so&#xD;
      that expelled saliva can be analyzed to determine airway inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 7) Prospective quantitative computed tomography (CT) imaging will be completed to obtain&#xD;
      lung density, heterogeneity, tissue, vascular and airway measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each visit will take approximately 3 hours. The total time duration for each participant will&#xD;
      be approximately 21 hours.&#xD;
