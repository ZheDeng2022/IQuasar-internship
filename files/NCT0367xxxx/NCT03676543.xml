  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Epileptic seizures arise from neuronal defects that often alter the capacity of the brain to&#xD;
      process sensory information. During absence seizures, a frequent epileptic syndrome in&#xD;
      children, the normal conscious and perceptual processes are temporarily interrupted. This is&#xD;
      the result of abnormal synchronized neural activities in the thalamo-cortical loops, leading&#xD;
      to bilateral spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs) in the cortical electroencephalograms (EEGs).&#xD;
      The brain mechanisms underlying the lack of sensory experience during absence seizures are&#xD;
      disputed. Based on preliminary data, the investigators hypothesize that the alternation of&#xD;
      'spike' and 'wave' patterns during seizure could cause a time-to-time inconstancy in cortical&#xD;
      responsiveness, preventing conscious perception. Using a real-time closed-loop stimulation&#xD;
      system, the investigators will research how the S- and W-patterns specifically alter the&#xD;
      sensory-evoked responses in the EEG. During a standard EEG, visual stimulations will be&#xD;
      applied between and during absence seizures to test the hypothesis that repeated sensory&#xD;
      stimuli, applied with an appropriate timing relative to the seizure-related oscillatory&#xD;
      cycle, could negatively interfere with the regenerative network mechanisms involved in the&#xD;
      occurrence of SWDs. The completion of this project should permit to unveil a new neuronal&#xD;
      mechanism supporting the lack of conscious experience during absences and pave the way for&#xD;
      new clinical non-invasive strategies to interrupt ongoing seizure activity.&#xD;
