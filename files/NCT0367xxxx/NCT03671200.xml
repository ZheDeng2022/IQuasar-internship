  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A cross- sectional observational study which will investigate whether data of past caries&#xD;
      experience of the primary molars of 6-9 years old children can serve as an indicator for&#xD;
      caries development in first permanent molars.as the first permanent molars is selected to&#xD;
      represent the future caries status of the permanent dentition.&#xD;

      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross sectional study to investigate if there is any correlation between caries experience&#xD;
      in primary molars and first permanent molars among a group of Egyptian children. All the&#xD;
      procedures will be explained to the parents or guardians prior to the investigation.An&#xD;
      informed consent will be signed by the parents Study design: cross sectional study design.&#xD;
      Data for this particular study will be collected from the clinic of Pediatric Dentistry and&#xD;
      dental public health Department, Faculty of Dentistry, Cairo University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Clinical examination will be carried out while the child is sitting on dental unit,&#xD;
      using sterile diagnostic set (mirror and explorer) in daylight. No diagnostic radiographs&#xD;
      will be taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A custom-made examination chart will be filled for each child including date, name, age,&#xD;
      address, gender, medical history and previous dental treatment. Parents data includes: level&#xD;
      of education and oral hygiene level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to performing dental examination, the child will be asked to rinse his mouth with tap&#xD;
      water and the teeth will be cleaned with sterile cotton.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examiner will carefully inspect all surfaces of the teeth, for proper diagnosis, the&#xD;
      teeth were dried thoroughly with an air syringe. It will be important to see clearly and to&#xD;
      use the air syringe to distinguish readily cervical or interproximal caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the primary teeth will be evaluated using deft index and permanent teeth will be&#xD;
      evaluated using DMF index, both according to WHO criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (WHO, 2003) criteria: Clinical caries lesion shows the following criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesion in pit or fissure, or on a smooth tooth surface with cavitated undermined enamel, or a&#xD;
      detectably softened floor or wall.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Teeth with recurrent dental caries. In cases where the crown has been destroyed by caries and&#xD;
      only the root is left, the caries is judged to be crown caries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lesions not considered as clinical dental caries White or chalky spots (early carious&#xD;
      lesion). Stained enamel pits or fissures without visible cavitation or soft floor or walls&#xD;
      during examination by sharp explorer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dark, shiny, hard, pitted areas of enamel in a tooth showing signs of moderate to severe&#xD;
      enamel fluorosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child and parents will be given two printed sheet translated into Arabic, after the end&#xD;
      of the diagnosis, which will include his/her caries status, the right oral hygiene method to&#xD;
      be followed in order to maintain a good oral health status and any caries lesions that need&#xD;
      treatment by restorative material or preventive measures&#xD;
