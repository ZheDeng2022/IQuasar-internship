  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are one of the greatest causes of death to mothers and&#xD;
      babies. These disorders affect 1 out of every 10 pregnancies, the rate is increasing in the&#xD;
      United States, and rate of recurrence is as high as 50%. Treatments to prevent hypertensive&#xD;
      disorders of pregnancy from happening in future pregnancies are limited. There are currently&#xD;
      no effective interventions to prevent hypertension recurrence in pregnancy that do not&#xD;
      involve medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness interventions hold great potential as a medication-free approach to prevent the&#xD;
      recurrence of hypertension in pregnant women with histories of hypertensive disorders.&#xD;
      However, traditional group-based mindfulness training interventions, requiring 2.5 hours of&#xD;
      class attendance for 8 weeks plus a full-day retreat, are very difficult for pregnant women&#xD;
      with medical conditions to attend.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the current study is to determine if phone-delivered mindfulness training is an&#xD;
      acceptable intervention among pregnant women with histories of hypertensive disorders of&#xD;
      pregnancy. 20 pregnant women with histories of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy will be&#xD;
      randomly picked to participate in an 8-week phone-delivered mindfulness training intervention&#xD;
      (N=10) or usual care (N=10). All women will undergo blood pressure monitoring before and&#xD;
      after the intervention. The investigators predict that phone-delivered mindfulness training&#xD;
      will reduce risk for hypertension recurrence.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy are one of the greatest causes of perinatal morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy affect 1 out of every 10 pregnancies, the rate&#xD;
      has increased substantially over the past several decades, and rates of recurrence are as&#xD;
      high as 50%. Treatments to prevent the recurrence of hypertension are extremely limited and&#xD;
      include watchful waiting, anti-hypertensive medications, or ultimately, early delivery. There&#xD;
      are currently no effective alternatives to pharmacological interventions to prevent&#xD;
      hypertension recurrence in pregnancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness interventions hold great potential as a non-pharmacological approach to reduce&#xD;
      stress and prevent the recurrence of hypertension in pregnant women with histories of&#xD;
      hypertensive disorders. However, traditional group-based mindfulness training interventions,&#xD;
      requiring 2.5 hours of class attendance for 8 weeks plus a full-day retreat, are infeasible&#xD;
      in pregnancies complicated by hypertensive disorders due to the need for activity&#xD;
      restriction, hospitalization, and increased maternal and fetal monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the current study is to determine if phone-delivered mindfulness training is&#xD;
      feasible and acceptable among pregnant women with histories of hypertensive disorders of&#xD;
      pregnancy. 20 pregnant women with histories of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy will be&#xD;
      randomized to an 8-week phone-delivered mindfulness training intervention (N=10) or usual&#xD;
      care (N=10). All women will undergo 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring before and&#xD;
      after the intervention. The investigators will used a mixed-methods approach using both&#xD;
      quantitative and qualitative data to examine feasibility/acceptability. The working&#xD;
      hypothesis, to be tested in a fully-powered randomized controlled trial, is that&#xD;
      phone-delivered mindfulness training will reduce risk for hypertension recurrence.&#xD;
