  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ticagrelor has been demonstrated to provide a more rapid and more powerful inhibition of&#xD;
      platelet aggregation compared with clopidogrel in coronary artery disease (CAD) patients.&#xD;
      However, current guidelines recommend ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily might not be suitable for&#xD;
      patients of Chinese. Therefore, the investigators performed this study to observe the&#xD;
      efficacy of 60-mg ticagrelor in comparison to 75-mg clopidogrel in Chinese patients with&#xD;
      stable CAD.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and a P2Y12 receptor antagonist is the established&#xD;
      standard of care in ACS patients. Although a popular P2Y12 receptor inhibitor, clopidogrel is&#xD;
      not the most potent antiplatelet agent due to its metabolic activation. Metabolic activation&#xD;
      of clopidogrel depends on multiple cytochrome P450 (CYP) enzymes, including CYP2C19, which&#xD;
      can delay the onset of its activity; in addition, some populations carry a reduced-function&#xD;
      allele of the CYP2C19 gene. Notably, poor drug metabolism of clopidogrel is more common in&#xD;
      Asian populations compared with other international regions, due to the prevalence of CYP2C19&#xD;
      reduced-function alleles in these patients. A recent study indicated that Asians might have&#xD;
      different adverse event profiles (thrombophilia and bleeding) and &quot;therapeutic window&quot;&#xD;
      compared with white subjects, suggesting that regional differences may influence the altered&#xD;
      response of clopidogrel to the onset of thrombotic events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ticagrelor is an orally administered, reversibly-binding, direct-acting P2Y12 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist used clinically for the prevention of atherothrombotic events in patients with&#xD;
      ACS. Guidelines give a recommendation on the use of dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) support&#xD;
      ticagrelor 90 mg twice daily over clopidogrel 75 mg daily in addition to aspirin in ACS&#xD;
      patients with or without ST-segment elevation. Increasing evidence indicated that Asian&#xD;
      patients showed higher active metabolite exposure rates and stronger pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      responses than their Caucasian subjects when treated with the same oral doses of prasugrel&#xD;
      .In Korea and Japan, it has been reported that low doses of ticagrelor might have a more&#xD;
      potent inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) than clopidogrel in healthy subjects and&#xD;
      patients with stable coronary artery disease, respectively .In our previous study, the&#xD;
      investigators found that half-dose ticagrelor produced similar inhibitory effects on platelet&#xD;
      aggregation as standard-dose ticagrelor and exerted significantly stronger effects than&#xD;
      clopidogrel in patients with ACS and one-quarter standard-dose ticagrelor provided greater&#xD;
      degree of platelet inhibition than clopidogrel in patients with stable CAD. Furthermore,&#xD;
      standard-dose ticagrelor (180mg loading dose [LD], then 90mg twice daily) has a significant&#xD;
      increase in the risk of bleeding and incidence rate of dyspnea, and that higher&#xD;
      discontinuation rates due to adverse effects compared to clopidogrel. A recent study&#xD;
      demonstrated that maximum plasma concentration and area under the plasma concentration-time&#xD;
      curve of ticagrelor (90 mg twice daily) and its active metabolite (AR-C124910XX) tended to be&#xD;
      approximately 40% higher in healthy Chinese volunteers compared with Caucasian subjects.&#xD;
      Notably, poor drug metabolism of clopidogrel is more common in Asian populations compared&#xD;
      with other international regions, due to the prevalence of CYP2C19 reduced-function alleles.&#xD;
      The data suggested that a low dose of ticagrelor might be more appropriate for Chinese&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study were to evaluate the effects of ticagrelor (60.0mg daily) in&#xD;
      comparison to clopidogrel (75mg daily) on platelet reactivity in Chinese patients with stable&#xD;
      CAD.&#xD;
