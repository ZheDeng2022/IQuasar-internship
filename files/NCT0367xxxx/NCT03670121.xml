    <textblock>
      This study is a Prospective, single arm, single center pilot study following outcomes for 12&#xD;
      months after initial BTVA treatment. The primary objectives of the study are to prospectively&#xD;
      document the safety and efficacy of sequential segmental treatment with BTVA in patients with&#xD;
      a homogeneous distribution of emphysema that are not candidates for endobronchial valve&#xD;
      therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will include patients with severe emphysema as defined by pulmonary function tests,&#xD;
      a homogeneous distribution of emphysema as determined by CT, who are not eligible for&#xD;
      endobronchial valve therapy based on fissure integrity as determined by CT. Enrollment will&#xD;
      continue until 10 patients have been treated per protocol or until a maximum of 15 patients&#xD;
      total have been treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be enrolled at Thoraxklinik University of Heidelberg, Germany and followed for&#xD;
      twelve (12) months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The follow up data collected will include pulmonary function testing (spirometry, body&#xD;
      plethysmography, DLCO), exercise capacity (six minute walk test) and imaging findings (chest&#xD;
      x-ray and CT). Dyspnea score (mMRC) and quality of life questionnaire (SGRQ-C) information&#xD;
      will be obtained. Information regarding adverse events, serious adverse events, and major&#xD;
      medical complications will be collected at each visit. Serious adverse events will be&#xD;
      adjudicated by an independent medical monitor in order to establish relatedness to the&#xD;
      InterVapor device and procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will be used to summarize all safety and efficacy data. There is no&#xD;
      predefined hypothesis regarding safety, or efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring of the study will be undertaken as a continuous process to ensure that&#xD;
      high-quality data are obtained and to ensure compliance with study procedures.&#xD;

    <description>This trial will utilize the SGRQ-C which is a shortened version of the SGRQ questionnaire. The SGRQ is a validated, disease-specific questionnaire that measures health-related quality of life in patients with COPD.&#xD;
The instrument has 3 domains (activity, symptoms, and impacts) and a total score. A Total and three-component scores are calculated: Symptoms; Activity; Impacts. Each questionnaire response has a unique empirically derived 'weight'. The lowest possible weight is zero and the highest is 100. Each component of the questionnaire is scored separately. Sum of maximum possible weights for each component and Total: Symptoms 566.2, Activity 982.9, Impacts 1652.8. Total (sum of maximum for all three components) 3201.9 Higher weights indicate worse outcomes. The difference in the domain scores and total score at follow-up visits relative to baseline will be calculated and reported.</description>

Grade Degree of Breathlessness Related to Activities Grade 0 No breathlessness except with strenuous exercise Grade 1 Breathlessness when hurrying on the level or walking up a slight hill Grade 2 Walks slower than people of the same age on the level because of breathlessness or has to stop for breath when walking at own pace on the level Grade 3 Stops for breath after walking about 100 yards or a few minutes on the level Grade 4 Too breathless to leave the house or breathless when dressing or undressing Max score=4, Min score=0 One score is reported based on grade. Higher values represent worse outcomes. For patients with a higher mMRC grade (e.g. ≥2) and clinical circumstances consistent with respiratory disease, measuring spirometry (e.g., FEV₁ and FVC), determining the patient's GOLD stage, helps guide therapeutic interventions.</description>
