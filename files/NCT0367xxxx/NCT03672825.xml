  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an FDA phase I study to evaluate the safety of allogeneic culture-expanded&#xD;
      adipose-derived mesenchymal stem cells (AMSCs) combined with autologous cartilage cells to&#xD;
      treat focal knee cartilage defects in one stage surgery.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This phase I study will enroll 25 subjects with unilateral, symptomatic ICRS Grade III or IV&#xD;
      cartilage lesions of the knee will be candidates for this study. Baseline data will include&#xD;
      physical examination of the knee, clinical assessment of knee pain and function using&#xD;
      validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs), radiographs, and MRI. Tissue from&#xD;
      qualified donors will be used to establish allogeneic MSC banks (using current Good&#xD;
      Manufacturing Practices (cGMPs) based on standard operating procedures), which will be tested&#xD;
      and released for clinical use. Patients will undergo surgical debridement of their cartilage&#xD;
      defect with harvest of the articular cartilage surrounding the defect rim. Following rapid&#xD;
      digestion into chondrocytes and their pericellular matrix, autologous chondrons will be mixed&#xD;
      in a 1:4 ratio with allogeneic AMSCs obtained from AMSC banks and suspended in fibrin glue&#xD;
      for application to the debrided osteochondral defect. All patients will be clinically&#xD;
      evaluated at 1-2 weeks, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks, 52 weeks, 18 moths, and 24 months&#xD;
      post-RECLAIM for adverse events (AEs). Following completion of their respective RECLAIM&#xD;
      treatment, each subject will be followed-up for study endpoints using a predetermined&#xD;
      protocol, including clinical evaluation, radiography, and MRI.&#xD;

             following treatment. Females of childbearing potential are defined as premenopausal&#xD;
             and not surgically sterilized, or post-menopausal for fewer than 2 years. A urine&#xD;
             pregnancy test will be performed prior to the administration of the study drug to&#xD;
             confirm negative results. If the urine pregnancy test is positive, the study drug will&#xD;
             not be administered and the result will be confirmed by a serum pregnancy test. Urine&#xD;
             pregnancy tests will be performed by qualified personnel using kit.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Persons becoming pregnant during the study will continue to be monitored for the&#xD;
             duration of the study or completion of the pregnancy, whichever is longer. Monitoring&#xD;

             However, as outlined in the primary study endpoints, patients with previous episodes&#xD;
             of contralateral knee pain who experience a repeat episode of contralateral pain&#xD;
             similar to their established pattern of pain during the course of the trial will not&#xD;
             be considered as having experienced an adverse event.&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. No additional surgery planned in the target knee for at least 12 months following&#xD;
             RECLAIM therapy&#xD;
