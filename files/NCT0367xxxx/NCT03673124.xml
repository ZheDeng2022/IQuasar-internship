      The study evaluates the response to treatment with Ribociclib and Letrozole in patients with&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ribociclib (formerly LEE011) is an orally bioavailable, highly selective small molecule&#xD;
      inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 6 (CDK4/6). Ribociclib has been approved by the&#xD;
      United States Food and Drug Administration (U.S. FDA) and the European Commission as an&#xD;
      initial endocrine-based therapy for the treatment of postmenopausal women with hormone&#xD;
      receptor (HR)-positive, human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer in combination with an aromatase inhibitor based on a randomized,&#xD;
      double-blind, placebo-controlled, international clinical trial (MONALEESA-2). Additional&#xD;
      marketing authorizations are under review by health authorities. Additional phase III&#xD;
      clinical trials for the treatment of hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer patients,&#xD;
      as well as several other phase I or II clinical studies are being conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Letrozole is a highly potent, orally active non-steroidal competitive inhibitor of the&#xD;
      aromatase enzyme system. It effectively inhibits the conversion of androgens to estrogens&#xD;
      both in vitro and in vivo. It is indicated both as first-line treatment of postmenopausal&#xD;
      women with hormone receptor positive or hormone receptor unknown locally advanced or&#xD;
      metastatic breast cancer as well as for the treatment of advanced breast cancer in&#xD;
      postmenopausal women with disease progression following antiestrogen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on encouraging results in women with advanced hormone-receptor-positive breast cancer,&#xD;
      a clinical trial for women with recurrent low-grade serous carcinoma is warranted.&#xD;
      Furthermore, such a trial would have great appeal to women with recurrent low-grade serous&#xD;
      carcinoma, a cohort with limited therapeutic options. Although low-grade serous carcinoma is&#xD;
      a rather uncommon histologic subtype, prolonged overall survival results in a relatively high&#xD;
      prevalence.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patient has signed the Informed Consent (ICF) prior to any screening procedures being&#xD;
             performed and is able to comply with protocol requirements.&#xD;

&#xD;
             • In order to prevent inclusion of patients with high-grade serous carcinoma,&#xD;
             diagnosis of low-grade serous carcinoma will be verified as part of screening review&#xD;
             by a gynecologic pathologist. Tissue for confirmation can be from primary tumor or&#xD;
             recurrence.&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;

                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;

             Women are considered post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have&#xD;
             had 12 months of natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile&#xD;
             (e.g. age appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential.&#xD;
&#xD;
         17. Current use of food or drugs known to be potent CYP3A4 inhibitors, drugs known to be&#xD;
             potent CYP3A4 inducers, and drugs that are known to prolong the QT interval unless the&#xD;
             prohibited concomitant medication can be replaced by other drugs of less potential to&#xD;
             inhibit or induce CYP3A4 or prolong QT interval (See Appendix C for Prohibited&#xD;
             Concomitant Medications).&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Patients whose tumors contain both low-grade serous carcinoma (LGSC) and high-grade&#xD;
             serous carcinoma (HGSC)&#xD;
