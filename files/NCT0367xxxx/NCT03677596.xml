  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will explore 2 different doses of inotuzumab ozogamicin including the dose that is&#xD;
      approved and a lower dose. The main purpose of this study is to evaluate whether a dose of&#xD;
      inotuzumab ozogamicin, lower than the approved dose, could be recommended for adult patient&#xD;
      with relapsed or refractory ALL who may be at higher risk for severe liver problems after&#xD;
      inotuzumab ozogamicin treatment and stem cell transplant (a potentially curative therapy that&#xD;
      can replace cancer cells with healthy cells). Efficacy and safety of the 2 doses will be&#xD;
      evaluated.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>The study will be conducted in 2 phases: a run in phase and a randomized phase.&#xD;
Run in phase: a total of up to 22 patients will be enrolled to receive the starting dose of 1.2 mg/m2/cycle (dose level 2). A Simon Two Stage optimal design will be used. If acceptable efficacy (CR/CRi and MRD negativity) is observed in the run in phase, the study will enter the randomized phase.&#xD;
Randomized phase: if acceptable efficacy is observed in the run in phase, the study will enter the randomized phase. A total of approximately 80 patients will be randomized (1:1) to 1 of 2 dose levels of inotuzumab ozogamicin (40 patients per dose level).</intervention_model_description>
