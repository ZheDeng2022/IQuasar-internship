    <textblock>
      This is a 12-week treatment, singlecenter, open-label, single-arm, dose-selection, proof of&#xD;
      concept study to determine a dosage of HSP 90 inhibitor (CUDC-305) that is tolerable and&#xD;
      demonstrates preliminary efficacy for use in future efficacy Phase 2 trials. Male or female&#xD;
      subjects aged 18 years or older with moderate to severe plaque psoriasis will be included in&#xD;
      this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives are to determine the efficacy, safety and tolerability of CUDC-305 in patients&#xD;
      with moderate to severe psoriasis.&#xD;
