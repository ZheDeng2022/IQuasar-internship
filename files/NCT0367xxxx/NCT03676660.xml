  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of autism in Taiwan has been significantly increasing over this decade. Though&#xD;
      early intervention program and special and resource education have been applied in helping&#xD;
      individuals with autism in Taiwan, studies regarding autism in this country so far focus&#xD;
      mostly on the prevalence and demographics in restricted populations, diagnostic category,&#xD;
      single case observation, and clinical research. Although the data of needs of care and&#xD;
      intervention models in autism emerges in Western countries, there is a lack of such data in&#xD;
      Taiwan. Due to the high prevalence, long-term impairing and lack of effective prevention,&#xD;
      detection, and treatment for autism, tremendous of the resource is needed to be given to&#xD;
      individuals with autism. However, the investigators do not know the gap between the need and&#xD;
      provided care in currently. This study aims to understand the current state of needs of care&#xD;
      and intervention in autism from different stakeholders to inform and improve the health care&#xD;
      policies for autism and to establish a holistic care/intervention model for autism in Taiwan.&#xD;

      This study will enroll individuals with autism and their family members from autism-related&#xD;
      medical, nongovernmental organizations, and general educational settings, where from&#xD;
      elementary schools to colleges, in Taiwan. For patients and their family, the investigators&#xD;
      will enroll total 2000 adult individuals with autism and their family members for the&#xD;
      questionnaire survey. The needs of assessment and care, and intervention models in autism&#xD;
      will be examined using the Chinese version of Camberwell Assessment of Need, autistic traits&#xD;
      assessment, emotional difficulty questionnaire, quality of life and Self-administered&#xD;
      questionnaire with different versions for stakeholders. The guides for parents and clinicians&#xD;
      on autism will be discussed with the patient and family representatives and developed by&#xD;
      different autism stakeholders, experts, and scholars based on regular research meetings.&#xD;
      Quantitative analyses will be conducted to understand the need and difficulty of care and&#xD;
      interventions in autism across different developmental stage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators anticipate to find differences in care needs by personal characteristics.&#xD;
      The survey of the care needs of autism will provide family members, medical and nursing&#xD;
      personnel, and related caregivers more information about understanding their care&#xD;
      requirements. These results will help the government for the formulation of policies related&#xD;
      to early treatment and long-term care. Finally, the guides for parents and clinician on&#xD;
      autism would be suggested references.&#xD;
