      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with gemcitabine plus cisplatin followed by radical liver resection&#xD;
      versus immediate radical liver resection alone with or without adjuvant chemotherapy in&#xD;
      incidentally detected gallbladder carcinoma after simple cholecystectomy or in front of&#xD;
      radical resection of BTC (ICC/ECC)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to investigate whether induction chemotherapy followed by radical&#xD;
      re-resection (and - if possible - postoperative chemotherapy) in incidental gallbladder&#xD;
      carcinoma (IGBC) or in front radical resection in biliary tract cancer (BTC) (intrahepatic&#xD;
      cholangiocarcinoma (ICC)/ extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ECC)) prolongs overall survival&#xD;
      without impaired quality of life compared to immediate radical surgery alone with or without&#xD;
      adjuvant chemotherapy (investigator's choice) in patients with IGBC, or BTC (ICC/ECC). One of&#xD;
      the most important secondary objectives is to raise awareness for the necessity of a radical&#xD;
      second surgery as well as to improve the adherence to the treatment guidelines in IGBC.&#xD;
      Further secondary objectives are safety and tolerability of the treatment as well as quality&#xD;
      of life.&#xD;

    <description>&quot;European Organisation for the Research and Treatment of Cancer&quot; Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is a questionnaire developed to assess the quality of life of cancer patients.&#xD;
The QLQ-C30 is composed of both multi-item scales and single-item measures. These include five functional scales, three symptom scales, a global health status / QoL scale, and six single items.&#xD;
Each of the multi-item scales includes a different set of items - no item occurs in more than one scale.&#xD;
All of the scales and single-item measures range in score from 0 to 100. A high scale score represents a higher response level.&#xD;
Thus a high score for a functional scale represents a high / healthy level of functioning, a high score for the global health status / QoL represents a high QoL, but a high score for a symptom scale / item represents a high level of symptomatology / problems.</description>

          4. ECOG performance status of 0, 1, or 2.&#xD;

             study protocol and with the planned surgical procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. No previous or preceding cytotoxic or targeted therapy for BTC or IGBC/GBC.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. No previous malignancy within two years or concomitant malignancy, except for&#xD;

&#xD;
         10. No severe or uncontrolled cardiovascular disease (congestive heart failure NYHA III or&#xD;
             IV, unstable angina pectoris, history of myocardial infarction in the last three&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. Absence of psychiatric disorder precluding understanding of information of trial&#xD;
             related topics and giving informed consent.&#xD;

             impair the ability of the patient to participate in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. A) Females of childbearing potential must agree to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods that result in a failure rate&#xD;
             of &lt;1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 7 months after the last&#xD;
             study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
             A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has&#xD;
             not reached a postmenopausal state (has not had ≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea&#xD;
             with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). Examples of contraceptive methods&#xD;
             with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include bilateral tubal ligation, male&#xD;
             sterilization, hormonal implants, established, proper use of combined oral or injected&#xD;
             hormonal contraceptives, and certain intrauterine devices. The reliability of sexual&#xD;
             abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the duration of the clinical trial and&#xD;
             the preferred and usual lifestyle of the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar,&#xD;

             remain abstinent or use a condom plus an additional contraceptive method that together&#xD;
             result in a failure rate of 1% per year during the treatment period and for at least 6&#xD;
             months after the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. Men must&#xD;
             refrain from donating sperm during this same period. Men with a pregnant partner must&#xD;
             agree to remain abstinent or to use a condom for the duration of the pregnancy.&#xD;

             switched to low molecular weight heparin and have achieved stable coagulation profile&#xD;
             prior to randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. No active uncontrolled infection, except chronic viral hepatitis under antiviral&#xD;
             therapy (patients on long-term antibiotics are eligible provided signs of active&#xD;
