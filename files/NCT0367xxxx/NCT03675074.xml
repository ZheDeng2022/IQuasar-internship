      This prospective, multicenter, open label, single arm study will enroll subjects presenting&#xD;
      with obesity and inadequately controlled type II diabetes (T2DM). A dual path jejunoileal&#xD;
      side-to-side anastomosis is endoscopically created using the Neujia device. Subjects are&#xD;
      followed for 12 months and annually thereafter for up to 5 years to assess change in&#xD;
      metabolic parameters, medications, weight, and adverse events.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For many obese diabetics, medical treatment and lifestyle modification fail to provide&#xD;
      acceptable glucose levels or durable weight loss. Bariatric surgical procedures have been&#xD;
      proven to provide better glycemic control and to improve life expectancy and quality of life.&#xD;
      But these are invasive procedures with significant complications, and notwithstanding the&#xD;
      strong clinical evidence and consensus guidance, less than 2% of patients who would benefit&#xD;
      from bariatric surgery choose to undergo the invasive procedures. There is therefore a&#xD;
      significant unmet clinical need for metabolic/bariatric therapies that result in durable&#xD;
      improvement in glycemic control, decreased anti-diabetic medication requirements, and weight&#xD;
      loss, with fewer and less severe complications than invasive bariatric surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Human clinical data suggests that partial diversion through a side-to-side jejunoileal&#xD;
      anastomosis results in an absolute decrease in HbA1c of 1.9 to 3.6 percentage points and a&#xD;
      decrease in total weight of 9.6 to 14.6% at 12 months. Although these studies used other&#xD;
      methods, they provide good evidence that the anastomosis created by Neujia should be expected&#xD;
      to safely improve glycemic control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A minimally invasive anastomosis device (Neujia) and endoscopic delivery system have been&#xD;
      developed to create a side-to-side jejunoileal anastomosis. One device is deployed in the&#xD;
      jejunum, approximately 30 to 100 cm distal to the ligament of Treitz, and the other in the&#xD;
      ileum, approximately 30 to 100 cm proximal to the ileocecal valve. The devices are mated&#xD;
      under endoscopic guidance with fluoroscopic visualization and create a compression&#xD;
      anastomosis. Neujia has the potential to provide a fully endoscopic, incisionless procedure&#xD;
      that achieves durable weight loss and glycemic control without the risks of bariatric&#xD;
      surgery. The proposed single arm study is designed to assess the feasibility and safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of the Neujia device when used to treat T2DM and obesity. Subjects are followed for&#xD;
      12 months and annually thereafter for up to 5 years to assess change in metabolic parameters,&#xD;
      medications, weight, and adverse events.&#xD;
