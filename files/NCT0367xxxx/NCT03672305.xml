      Title: Single-center, open clinical study on the efficacy and safety of c-Met/PD-L1 T cell&#xD;
      injection in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage: Phase I clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells in patients with&#xD;
      primary hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Object: patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: 50 cases&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of centresï¼š1&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: CT, MRI, PET and blood biochemical tests were performed before treatment to&#xD;
      evaluate the state of HCC. Peripheral blood of the patient was extracted and PBMC was&#xD;
      isolated. CAR-T cells were obtained by tranducing PBMC with c-Met/PD-L1 CAR lentivirus, and&#xD;
      the proliferation capacity and immune phenotype of the cells were tested. After passing the&#xD;
      inspection, the cells were re-injected into the patient three times. The efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells was assessed respectively at 4 week, 12 week, 24 week and 48 week&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial product: c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells&#xD;
&#xD;
      Course of treatment: 3 days for a course of treatment, only one course of treatment. A second&#xD;
      course is given as appropriate if the treatment is beneficial to the patient.&#xD;

      Title: Single-center, open clinical study on the efficacy and safety of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T&#xD;
      cell injection in the treatment of primary hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cell injection in the treatment of primary&#xD;
      hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the clinical safety of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cell injection in the treatment of&#xD;
           primary hepatocellular carcinoma;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To assess the amplification and persistence of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells in subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:Single center, open clinical study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects:Patients with primary hepatocellular carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trial cycle:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening stage:Selecting enrolled patients and collecting peripheral mononuclear cells;&#xD;
      Treating stage: Pretreating and the backtransfusing c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells Follow-up&#xD;
      stage:Treatment was observed for 28 days (short-term follow-up), 28 days to 24 weeks&#xD;
      (mid-term follow-up), and 24 weeks to progression/death (long-term follow-up);&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial product:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Trial product:c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells Dosage:The backtransfusion dose was determined by the&#xD;
      investigator based on the subject's own/disease condition and in vitro preparation&#xD;
      (recommended dose: 2 * 10^6/kg); Infusion way:Steady intravenous drip within 15 to 30 minutes&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical trial procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The screening period:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The subjects signed the informed consent form and performed a series of examinations&#xD;
           according to the interview flow chart. The researchers judged whether the subjects met&#xD;
           the inclusion criteria according to the examination results and inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
           criteria, and did not meet the exclusion criteria. If the subjects were enrolled,&#xD;
           peripheral blood mononuclear cells were collected, and the collection standard was 2-4 *&#xD;
           10^8 white blood cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. nonmyeloablative pretreatment:(The following options are selected on a case-by-case&#xD;
           basis)&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Fludarabine+Cyclophosphamide (FC)&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Bis-1-nitrosourea+Etoposide+Arabinoside+Cyclophosphamide (BECA);&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Retransfusion period:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The specific time and dose of retransfusion can be determined by the researchers;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Short-term follow-up period:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will undergo a series of examinations according to the visit flow chart within&#xD;
           28 days after the expected dose of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells injection.The short-term&#xD;
           efficacy and safety of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells injection were evaluated by the&#xD;
           researchers based on the test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Mid-term follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will undergo a series of examinations according to the visit flow chart 28 days&#xD;
           to 24 weeks after re-transfusion of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells injection.The researchers&#xD;
           will evaluate the mid-term efficacy and safety of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells based on the&#xD;
           test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Long-term follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Subjects will undergo a series of examinations according to the visit flow chart 24&#xD;
           weeks later until progress or death after retransfusion of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells.The&#xD;
           long-term efficacy and safety of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells will be evaluated according to&#xD;
           the test results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Withdrawal visit (at any time) :All subjects may withdraw from this study at any stage&#xD;
           of the trial.If the subjects withdraw from the study after returning to the c-Met/PD-L1&#xD;
           CAR-T cells, they shall complete the inspection items required in the visit flow chart,&#xD;
           and the reason for the withdrawal shall be recorded in detail by the researchers.If the&#xD;
           subject passes screening but withdraws from the visit before returning to the&#xD;
           c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells, only the baseline and screening tests need to be completed, and&#xD;
           the reason for withdrawal will be recorded in detail by the investigators.If the subject&#xD;
           withdraws from the screening test before the end of the screening test, only the&#xD;
           screening test shall be completed and the reason for withdrawal shall be recorded in&#xD;
           detail by the investigators.If treatment is discontinued due to adverse reactions (AE),&#xD;
           the investigators will follow up with the necessary safety until the subjects return to&#xD;
           baseline or to a stable state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluation index Main evaluation index&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Objective tumor remission rate (ORR),complete remission (CR) and partial remission (PR)&#xD;
           at 4 weeks, 12 weeks, 24 weeks and 48 weeks after treatment with c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T&#xD;
           cells;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Overall survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Progression free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Event-free survival&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary evaluation index&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Incidence of treatment-related adverse events (level 3 or level 4 adverse reactions,&#xD;
           CTCAE V4.03 criteria). These included adverse events related to the treatment of&#xD;
           c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells, severe adverse events and clinically significant laboratory&#xD;
           abnormalities;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The amplification level of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells in the subjects varied with time;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Duration of c-Met/PD-L1 CAR-T cells in the subjects;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The abatement features of hepatocellular carcinoma in subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis SPSS18.0 was used for statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The primary and secondary end points were analyzed by intentionality. The statistical&#xD;
           analysis method of the end point was used to describe tumor ORR according to different&#xD;
           follow-up time. Kaplan-meier method and survival curve were used to describe OS, PFS and&#xD;
           EFS&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The statistical analysis method of the secondary study endpoint was to describe the&#xD;
           occurrence number and incidence of treatment-related adverse events, and to compare the&#xD;
           difference of vital signs and laboratory indexes before and after treatment&#xD;
