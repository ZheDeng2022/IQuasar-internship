    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2, multicenter, double-blind, randomized (1:1), placebo-controlled, 12-week,&#xD;
      proof-of-concept study to evaluate the safety and tolerability as well as the mechanistic&#xD;
      effect of oral administration of alvelestat (MPH966) in subjects with confirmed AATD defined&#xD;
      as Pi*ZZ, Pi*SZ, Pi*null, or another rare phenotype/genotype known to be associated with&#xD;
      either low (serum AAT level &lt;11 μM or &lt;57.2 mg/dL) or functionally impaired AAT including &quot;F&quot;&#xD;
      or &quot;I&quot; mutations.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency (AATD) is the most common genetic cause of chronic obstructive&#xD;
      pulmonary disease (COPD) and early-onset emphysema. AATD is characterized by low AAT levels;&#xD;
      leading to excessive neutrophil elastase (NE) mediated lung destruction. Current treatment&#xD;
      requires the periodic infusion of pooled AAT derived from human plasma, but this therapeutic&#xD;
      approach (termed augmentation) does not definitively slow the rate of emphysema&#xD;
      progressionlung function decline and is very expensive. In addition, it is not clear that the&#xD;
      currently recommended dose for augmentation fully controls lung inflammation and destruction.&#xD;
      Alvelestat (MPH966, formerly AZD9668) is a potent, selective, and reversible, oral inhibitor&#xD;
      of human NE. Suppression of NE is expected to reduce lung damage and may slow disease&#xD;
      progression. This study is to establish proof of clinical concept by investigating the&#xD;
      mechanistic effect and safety of alvelestat (MPH966) in patients with AATD.&#xD;
