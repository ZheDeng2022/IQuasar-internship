  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Office-based buprenorphine could be expanded to treat many of the opioid users who are not in&#xD;
      treatment and who are at great risk for opioid overdose, but effective approaches are needed&#xD;
      to help individuals with opioid use disorder initiate and remain in office-based&#xD;
      buprenorphine treatment. Investigators propose to develop and pilot test a novel intervention&#xD;
      that will combine video-based directly observed therapy and incentives to promote&#xD;
      buprenorphine treatment engagement and adherence in out-of-treatment opioid users.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The United States is experiencing an epidemic of opioid-related overdose deaths. Office-based&#xD;
      buprenorphine treatment could expand access to treatment to the many opioid users who are not&#xD;
      in treatment and who are at great risk for opioid overdose. However, office-based&#xD;
      buprenorphine has two limitations that Investigators will address in this application: 1)&#xD;
      Patients prescribed buprenorphine by office-based providers can divert the buprenorphine for&#xD;
      illicit use. 2) Many people in need of buprenorphine treatment do not initiate and remain in&#xD;
      office-based buprenorphine treatment. Investigators will use Video Directly Observed Therapy&#xD;
      (DOT) and incentives to enhance office-based buprenorphine treatment. Video DOT is an&#xD;
      innovative, mobile health platform that patients can use to record and submit videos of&#xD;
      patients taking medication that are then viewable on a secure, web portal for providers to&#xD;
      confirm medication adherence. Video DOT could facilitate adherence to buprenorphine treatment&#xD;
      and safeguard against diversion. The addition of incentives could engage out-of-treatment&#xD;
      opioid users into treatment and increase treatment retention. Incentive interventions, which&#xD;
      provide incentives to patients meeting therapeutic goals, have been highly effective in&#xD;
      promoting a wide range of health behaviors and have firm theoretical and empirical&#xD;
      foundations. Incentive interventions can promote treatment engagement in individuals with&#xD;
      substance use disorders, including out-of-treatment opioid users. Investigators propose to&#xD;
      develop and pilot test a novel combination of Video DOT and incentives to promote&#xD;
      buprenorphine treatment engagement and adherence in out-of-treatment opioid users. The Video&#xD;
      DOT+ intervention will provide an incentive for linking to buprenorphine treatment and&#xD;
      facilitate retention in treatment by providing incentives for maintaining daily buprenorphine&#xD;
      use as verified by the Video DOT system. The incentives will be integrated into the Video DOT&#xD;
      platform and delivered remotely to reloadable credit cards to allow for the entire&#xD;
      intervention to be delivered via mobile technology and to facilitate easy dissemination of&#xD;
      the Video DOT+ system. A randomized pilot study is planned over 3 years. Out-of-treatment&#xD;
      opioid users (N=64) will be referred to buprenorphine treatment and randomly assigned to a&#xD;
      Usual Care (Control) group or Video DOT+ group. Video DOT+ participants will receive the&#xD;
      Video DOT+ intervention being developed and evaluated in this project. Investigators will&#xD;
      assess participants every 4 weeks throughout a 24-week intervention period and at 12 weeks&#xD;
      after the intervention ends. The primary outcome measure will be buprenorphine treatment&#xD;
      adherence during the 24-week intervention. Secondary measures will include buprenorphine&#xD;
      treatment engagement (linkage and retention), opioid use, risk of opioid overdose, and&#xD;
      post-intervention effects. The project will allow for the development and preliminary&#xD;
      evaluation of a novel intervention to promote buprenorphine treatment engagement and&#xD;
      adherence in out-of-treatment opioid users. Ultimately, Investigators would like to develop&#xD;
      and disseminate an effective and scalable intervention that can enhance office-based&#xD;
      buprenorphine treatment and thereby combat the opioid overdose epidemic.&#xD;
