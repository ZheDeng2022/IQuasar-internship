  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypothalamic obesity (HO) is an obesity secondary to an alteration of the functioning of the&#xD;
      hypothalamus, the central organ of energy homeostasis. The causes of OH are related to an&#xD;
      hypothalamic lesion (eg craniopharyngioma) or to genetic diseases (ex: Prader-Willi&#xD;
      syndrome). OH, which accounts for about 5 to 10% of obesity, is a complex handicap&#xD;
      characterized by severe obesity associated with eating disorders, cognitive and behavioral&#xD;
      disorders and sometimes a visual deficit, with a major impact on quality of life, morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality. There is currently no specific treatment of HO. Management is essentially&#xD;
      behavioral, based on daily support of eating behavior and physical activities (PA). OH is&#xD;
      characterized by an intense and almost permanent hunger felt, a satiety disorder and an&#xD;
      obsessive interest in food. The food education of the entourage is essential, the advise&#xD;
      concern the control of the access to food and the setting up of a precise food frame on the&#xD;
      quantities, with low energetic density, and schedules. OH is characterized by obesity with&#xD;
      lean mass deficit. PA must therefore be regular, adapted to the disability and personalized&#xD;
      to take into account cognitive deficits and behavioral disorders. Although the supervision of&#xD;
      meals and daily PA is now recognized as fundamental in the care of these patients (National&#xD;
      Program of Diagnosis and Care established by the French &quot;Haute Autorité de Santé&quot;), few&#xD;
      studies have evaluated the effectiveness of programs with personalized support on global&#xD;
      health. The investigators hypothesize that a personalized 4-month individual home-based&#xD;
      counseling program on dietary counseling and PA can be effective to modify behaviors such as&#xD;
      diet and PAs with an impact on changing weight and quality of life. The 16-week program&#xD;
      includes a dietetic component (initial assessment with dietary care plan followed by a&#xD;
      30-minute telephone interview every month with dietician) and a PA component (two 1-hour&#xD;
      individualized sessions, performed at home and supervised by a PA educator). Before and after&#xD;
      the program, the investigators will evaluate habitual PA with an accelerometer, feeding&#xD;
      behavior, physical functioning, weight change, body composition, quality of life and will&#xD;
      constitute a biobank of serums, adipose tissues and stools. If the effectiveness of this&#xD;
      program is demonstrated this will help to find ways to sustain this support by the&#xD;
      institutions, to train professionals in the complex accompaniment of these patients. Finally&#xD;
      this program set up as part of a rare disease can show the benefits in other populations of&#xD;
      more common pathology (common severe obesity, intellectual disability, behavioral disorders).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypothalamic obesity (HO) is defined as obesity secondary to impaired functioning of the&#xD;
      hypothalamus nuclei, the central organ of energy and weight homeostasis. Among the causes of&#xD;
      OH, there are those related to a hypothalamic lesion (lesional) such as craniopharyngioma&#xD;
      (CP) or inflammatory (sarcoidosis, tuberculosis etc ..) and those called genetic, with gene&#xD;
      abnormalities involved in the central regulation of energy homeostasis. The genetic causes of&#xD;
      obesity can be either &quot;monogenic&quot; by mutation of genes involved in the leptin / melanocortin&#xD;
      pathway, or &quot;syndromic&quot;, defined by the association of obesity and other clinical signs&#xD;
      (syndrome), such as Prader-Willi syndrome (PWS). PWS, which has a frequency of 1/15000&#xD;
      births, is one of the most well-known obesity-related syndromes. It is characterized by&#xD;
      muscle hypotonia at birth, severe hyperphagia and dietary impulsivity, dysmorphic features,&#xD;
      and intellectual disability with cognitive-behavioral abnormalities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although HO has various origins, it has a common phenotype with the presence of severe&#xD;
      obesity, having a heavy impact on the morbidity and mortality. Obesity is multifactorial,&#xD;
      associated with an increase in energy intake, a decrease in energy expenditure and an&#xD;
      alteration of peripheral metabolism. First, impaired functioning of the hypothalamic nuclei&#xD;
      leads to resistance to leptin and other hormones involved in the energy balance (GLP1,&#xD;
      ghrelin etc.) leading to an increase in hunger and a lack of satiety responsible for&#xD;
      hyperphagia. An alteration of the cognitive control of food intake and a hyper activation of&#xD;
      the reward system have also been described in PWS, which can explain episodes of uncontrolled&#xD;
      food impulsivity (food theft) and a high sensitivity to external stimuli in particular&#xD;
      visualization of food. As such, it is a particularly interesting model for studying&#xD;
      hyperphagia and alterations in the control of food intake. It should be noted that eating&#xD;
      disorders vary from one individual to another but can also fluctuate for the same individual&#xD;
      depending on the psychological state of the patients and their daily activities. The&#xD;
      involvement of the autonomic nervous system leads to a decrease in the sympathetic tone&#xD;
      responsible for a fall in resting energy expenditure. Indeed, there is a positive correlation&#xD;
      between autonomic nervous system activity, basal metabolism, and spontaneous physical&#xD;
      activity. In addition, endocrine deficits, present in HO, not or insufficiently substituted,&#xD;
      such as gonadotropic, thyrotropic or somatotropic insufficiency have also a negative impact&#xD;
      on resting energy expenditure. The total energy expenditure is also lowered by the low&#xD;
      spontaneous physical activity (PA) of the patients in relation to the hypotonia described in&#xD;
      these patients and a reduction of the spontaneous activation of the movements. In addition,&#xD;
      sleep disorders (OSA, narcolepsy, daytime hypersomnolence) are common in patients with OH and&#xD;
      may increase exercise fatiguability and difficulties for patients to do PA. Finally, visual&#xD;
      disturbances (reduction of severe visual acuity by amputation of the visual field) associated&#xD;
      with optic chiasm involvement in lesion-induced HO or induced by craniopharyngioma tumor&#xD;
      resection, are also a limitation for PA and increase sedentary lifestyle. The absence of PA&#xD;
      and the increase in sedentary lifestyle are associated with abnormal body composition with an&#xD;
      increase in body fat at the expense of muscle mass . This is especially important in patients&#xD;
      with PWS associated with developmental muscle hypotonia].&#xD;
&#xD;
      People with HO have often cognitive deficits, learning difficulties and social skills&#xD;
      disorders. These are constant in the PWS but also in the lesional cause. All these factors&#xD;
      lead to altering the quality of life. Thus, an impairment of quality of life has been&#xD;
      demonstrated in 185 obese patients with craniopharyngioma in childhood. In our cohort of HO&#xD;
      subjects, mood disorders assessed by the HAD score are common: 91% for lesional HO 50% for&#xD;
      genetic HO and this is correlated with BMI. The Kendall-Taylor study shows that, in children&#xD;
      with craniopharyngioma, the quality of life score depends on the age at diagnosis, the&#xD;
      presence of somatotropic deficiency and BMI. At present, there is no specific treatment of&#xD;
      HO. Drug treatments have been proposed such as melatonin, somatostatin analogue or&#xD;
      sympathomimetics but with limited effects on weight and feeding behavior, resulting in no&#xD;
      prescribing recommendations given the lack of randomized studies with sufficient patient&#xD;
      samples. Sibutramine tested in patients with lesional or genetic HO, withdrawn from the&#xD;
      market in France since 2010 for potentially deleterious effects on the cardiovascular system.&#xD;
      GLP 1 analogues are also an interesting therapeutic approach in patients with&#xD;
      craniopharyngioma with some efficacy on weight , but are currently reserved for diabetic&#xD;
      patients. Regarding bariatric surgery, the HAS recommends that &quot;the indication must be&#xD;
      exceptional and discussed on a case by case basis&quot;. A meta-analysis of the results of&#xD;
      bariatric surgery in 21 subjects with craniopharyngioma showed a weight loss at 1 year of&#xD;
      15.1 kg, in the same average as the obese general population operated. Nevertheless the&#xD;
      subjects were selected (absence of important behavioral disorders) and the results concern&#xD;
      only the short term. In genetic HO, especially PWS, the results of bariatric surgery should&#xD;
      be used with caution. In terms of weight loss, the results are not as good, with medium-term&#xD;
      weight regain, persistence of hyperphagia despite the reduction of the gastric pouch, and an&#xD;
      increased risk of morbidity and mortality. Management is essentially behavioral, based on&#xD;
      daily support of eating behavior and PA. Food management requires from a very young age for&#xD;
      these patients, a permanent food control, to fight against primary impulsivity of central&#xD;
      origin, can be a cause of frustration and behavioral disorders. Indeed, the genetic syndrome&#xD;
      is characterized by intense and permanent hunger, a lack of satiety and an obsession for&#xD;
      food. The affected patients are completely overwhelmed by this addictive behavior. It is&#xD;
      extremely difficult or impossible for the child as for the adult with this syndrome to&#xD;
      control his dietary intake. The entourage must therefore control access to food at home and&#xD;
      abroad. This requires constant supervision. An early education of food in the family is&#xD;
      essential because today it there is no possible and sustainable autonomy regarding diet for&#xD;
      these patients. There is a strong need for coherence for caregivers to avoid unnecessary&#xD;
      discussions and arguments. It is necessary to inform, prevent, associate the family and&#xD;
      friendly entourage so that there is a coherence with the line of conduct chosen by all.&#xD;
      Patients can not feel the signals that would allow them to have a meal like other people, so&#xD;
      it is recommended to put in place a precise food frame on quantities and schedules, a low&#xD;
      energy density food setting while providing sufficient food volume. A strict framework&#xD;
      reassures and secures the patient because he has benchmarks. This is to reassure the person&#xD;
      himself, to do everything possible to limit the temptations that are a source of tantrums and&#xD;
      frustration. By respecting meal schedules and their composition (&quot;food security&quot;), by&#xD;
      diverting patients' thinking, by occupying them, we can improve the food obsession of&#xD;
      patients with HO. This specific and personalized dietary management is therefore necessary&#xD;
      and essential. Physical activities are also a basic component of treating common obesity and&#xD;
      its complications. It has a favorable effect on weight control, especially on the prevention&#xD;
      of weight gain. In addition, PA has important beneficial effects on body composition.&#xD;
      Regardless of weight loss, PA decreases total body fat and visceral abdominal fat. It also&#xD;
      limits the loss of muscle mass during weight loss. Beyond its effects on weight control and&#xD;
      body composition, PA is beneficially associated with many health parameters and decreases the&#xD;
      risk of developing the major complications of obesity (type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases). PA is also associated with an increase in quality of life. Finally, PA improves&#xD;
      physical capacity that is often greatly diminished in obese subjects. Obesity is associated,&#xD;
      on the one hand, with a decrease in cardiorespiratory fitness, muscular strength, functional&#xD;
      capacity (observed for example during the 6-minute walk test) and, on the other hand,&#xD;
      impaired balance and locomotion. Studies in patients with HO showed that patients had a low&#xD;
      level of PA. Only one study measured PA level in the PWS. PA was measured using&#xD;
      accelerometers in 28 young adults with moderate obesity. Only 25% of men and 15% of women&#xD;
      achieved the minimum level of recommended PA and the average daily duration of moderate to&#xD;
      high intensity AP was 14 minutes. Two studies measured PA level using accelerometers or&#xD;
      pedometers in patients with craniopharyngioma. PA level was lower than that seen in normal&#xD;
      weight subjects. In addition, the functional capacity of HO subjects appears to be impaired.&#xD;
      For example, muscle strength, balance, and locomotion were assessed in 5 studies of 12 to 19&#xD;
      young adults with PWS and massive obesity. Muscle strength was significantly reduced compared&#xD;
      to normal weight subjects, but also compared to control obese subjects. The balance was also&#xD;
      altered, increasing the risk of falling. Finally, these patients adopted a different walking&#xD;
      pattern (decreased walking speed and step length, increased double support time). Grolla et&#xD;
      al. showed that a 4-week program, repeated 4 times a year, combining a low-calorie diet and a&#xD;
      sustained program of PA (up to 7 hours of activities per day, such as walking, exercise bike&#xD;
      , carpet exercises) reduced BMI of 2.5 kg / m2 and body fat by 2.5 kg in patients with PWS.&#xD;
      Two other studies evaluated the effect of a PA program combining an initial stay of 2 weeks&#xD;
      and a home-based training program for 6 months. During the initial 2 weeks, patients&#xD;
      participated in 4 sessions per week, supervised by trained staff, during which they performed&#xD;
      strength training and endurance exercises. During the following 6 months at home, patients&#xD;
      autonomously performed 3 sessions per week of muscle strengthening. This program resulted in&#xD;
      improved biomechanical parameters of the ankle and knee during walking. Other measured&#xD;
      parameters (muscle strength, balance) were unchanged. Another study followed patients with&#xD;
      PWS for 7 years during which patients regularly participated in rehabilitation programs&#xD;
      combining PA, dietary management and physiotherapy. The results showed an improvement in the&#xD;
      biomechanical parameters of gait. Thus, the management of HO should be comprehensive,&#xD;
      residing in the control of the environmental risk factors of weight gain: management of&#xD;
      hyperphagia by regular and personalized nutritional and dietary monitoring and appropriate&#xD;
      medico-social support (educator, informed parents). Compulsive eating behavior can be reduced&#xD;
      in a structured environment, with support and stimulation of other interests (especially&#xD;
      physical activities and activities). In addition, a daily PA is essential to compensate for&#xD;
      the decreased basic metabolism (see above). If support by PA and food management is now&#xD;
      recognized as a fundamental element of the care of patients suffering from HO (National&#xD;
      Program of Diagnosis and Care established by the HAS (Haute Autorité de Santé) http: //&#xD;
      www.has-sante.fr/portail/upload/docs/application/pdf/2012-06/ald_hors_liste_-_pnds_on_the_syn&#xD;
      drome_de_prader-willi.pdf), no study has evaluated the effectiveness of a personalized&#xD;
      support program, framed and at home, focusing on dietary counseling, control of eating&#xD;
      behavior and PA, on dietary behavior, patients' health status, physical activity volume and&#xD;
      functional capacity, the evolution of weight and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the investigators is that a personalized home-based support program for&#xD;
      dietary advice and PA for 4 months helps to change weight changes through behavioral changes&#xD;
      such as increasing habitual physical activity, improving eating behavior, functional capacity&#xD;
      and quality of life.&#xD;
