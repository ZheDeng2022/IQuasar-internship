      Family style dining is a widely-advocated approach by which to feed children in early&#xD;
      education settings. While family-style dining is hypothesized to allow children to attend to&#xD;
      their hunger and satiety and consume only the amount of food they need to meet their energy&#xD;
      needs, children's ability to self-regulate eating in this setting is dependent on a number of&#xD;
      factors including early life experiences, the feeding strategies caregivers use during meals,&#xD;
      and the eating environment. The goal of this study is to develop and implement a novel&#xD;
      curriculum for childcare providers, Mealtime Matters, that addresses the factors that&#xD;
      interfere with children's self-regulation of eating and offers caregivers strategies to&#xD;
      reduce exposures that promote over-eating in the early education environment. Mealtime&#xD;
      Matters will be pilot tested through a randomized controlled trial design with 7 Head Start&#xD;
      classrooms, enrolling approximately 72 low-income preschool-aged children. Intervention&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability will be examined, as well as changes in caregiver/child&#xD;
      mealtime interactions and children's dietary intake during meals at Head Start. Study results&#xD;
      will inform the development of a fully-scaled efficacy trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obesity disproportionately affects low-income children. Already by age 5, 20% of low-income&#xD;
      children in the US are obese, a prevalence three times higher than among high-income&#xD;
      children. Obesity that emerges by this young age is persistent and contributes to sustained&#xD;
      obesity and obesity-related chronic disease in adulthood. Identifying effective approaches to&#xD;
      prevent obesity among young, low-income children is a national priority.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Family-style dining, in which children serve themselves food and drinks from communal dishes,&#xD;
      is advocated as a strategy to prevent childhood obesity. It is theorized that family-style&#xD;
      dining allows children to attend to their hunger and satiety, and consume only the amount of&#xD;
      food they need to meet their energy needs. The alternative, where adults direct children's&#xD;
      intake, is theorized to interfere with children's ability to self-regulate their eating and&#xD;
      cause excess weight gain. Based on this theoretical model, the USDA's Child and Adult Care&#xD;
      Food Program (CACFP), which provides meals to 4.2 million low-income children annually, and&#xD;
      Head Start, the federally-funded preschool program that serves 42% of all preschool-aged&#xD;
      children in poverty nationally, strongly encourage family-style dining.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contrary to current beliefs however, the investigators posit that many low-income children&#xD;
      are not able to self-regulate their eating and overeat when allowed to self-serve, leading to&#xD;
      excess weight gain. Thus, family-style dining may increase, rather than decrease, obesity&#xD;
      among low-income children. Basic behavioral and epidemiologic research suggests that chronic&#xD;
      stress, which many low-income children experience, contributes to obesity-promoting appetite&#xD;
      characteristics among children. Laboratory-based experiments have demonstrated that appetite&#xD;
      characteristics such as these lead to excessive consumption when children are allowed to&#xD;
      self-serve. Among low-income preschoolers, one-third to one-half of children consume calories&#xD;
      in excess of Institute of Medicine recommendations during family-style meals. This excessive&#xD;
      energy intake is driven by intake of meat and grains, while intake of nutrient-dense, lower&#xD;
      calorie fruits and vegetables is far below recommendations. Children's excessive and&#xD;
      unbalanced eating during family-style dining is often noted by teachers, who are uncertain&#xD;
      how limit these behaviors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changing environmental supports for eating may be particularly important for modifying the&#xD;
      dietary intake of young children who, unlike adolescents and adults, do not yet have the&#xD;
      cognitive capacity to inhibit intake of highly palatable foods in favor of selecting food&#xD;
      based on healthfulness. Therefore, the objective of this Collaborative Research pilot study&#xD;
      is to conduct T2 translational research among low-income preschool children by developing an&#xD;
      easily-implemented curriculum to support family-style dining in Head Start called Mealtime&#xD;
      Matters, where teachers receive focused training on preschooler nutrition, appropriate&#xD;
      portion sizes for preschool children, responsive feeding strategies, and improvements to the&#xD;
      classroom environment that promote children's self-regulation of eating. The feasibility and&#xD;
      potential impact of Mealtime Matters will be examined with 72 children from up to 7 Head&#xD;
      Start classrooms in Adrian, Michigan. The investigators hypothesize that Mealtime Matters&#xD;
      will be feasible and acceptable to teachers. Further, by reducing prompts to over-consume and&#xD;
      empowering teachers to direct children to serve appropriate portion sizes while using&#xD;
      responsive feeding approaches, the investigators will: 1. Increase the proportion of children&#xD;
      consuming within an acceptable range of the recommended kilocalories (kcal) during meals at&#xD;
      Head Start and 2. Increase the servings of fruits and vegetables children consume during&#xD;
      meals at Head Start. Sustained engagement in these dietary behaviors can prevent excessive&#xD;
      weight gain and obesity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The specific aims of this trial are:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Examine the effect of Mealtime Matters on children's dietary intake during meals at&#xD;
      Head Start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Examine the effect of Mealtime Matters on teacher/child mealtime interactions at Head&#xD;
      Start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: Determine the feasibility and acceptability of Mealtime Matters among Head Start&#xD;
      teachers.&#xD;
