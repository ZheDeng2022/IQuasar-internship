  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ischemic stroke occurs when an artery to the brain is blocked. If the artery remains blocked&#xD;
      for more than a few minutes, the brain cells may die. This is why immediate medical treatment&#xD;
      is critical.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Luotai® is the brand name of Panax notoginseng finished product. 2 kinds of formulation are&#xD;
      available, the lyophilized powder for Injection and gelatin based soft capsule. They are&#xD;
      being used for decreasing incidence of cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be conducted as an observational study, regarding the safety, effectiveness&#xD;
      of Luotai treatment in acute ischemic stroke patients. This study will be carried out in&#xD;
      approximately 360 patients with acute stroke in 6 hospitals in Vietnam - Bạch Mai Hospital,&#xD;
      108 Military Hospital, 103 Military Hospital, Trung Vuong Hospital, Phu Tho General Hospital,&#xD;
      115 Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY PROCEDURES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be enrolled in an unbiased manner (by consecutive sampling) and consecutive&#xD;
      sampling method. The investigators will record participants' information required by the Case&#xD;
      Report Form. The study which last for about 3 months, and in each of the visit, the&#xD;
      information will be collected includes informed consent, demographic data, ischemic stroke&#xD;
      assessment, concomitant medication, adverse reactions. A travel transportation allowance of&#xD;
      VND 300,000 will be given for each visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive Luotai and other medications according to the local hospital&#xD;
      practice in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization in Vietnam. The&#xD;
      recommended dosage of Luotai is: Luotai™ injectable lyophilized powder for consecutive 14&#xD;
      days, Luotai soft capsules for 65 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participation of the study is fully voluntarily. Patients decide not to participate in&#xD;
      the study will not be disadvantaged in any way. All collected information from participants&#xD;
      is protected as confidential. The results of the study may be published in medical&#xD;
      literature, but participants will not be identified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study does not include any procedure/test that there were not indicated according to&#xD;
      local clinical practice. There is no specific associated risks or discomforts in this study&#xD;

      STUDY TITLE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A non-interventional, controlled, open-label (blinded assessor), prospective, multicenter,&#xD;
      observational registry study to investigate the clinical practices, safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of LUOTAI (Panax notoginseng) injectable lyophilized powder and soft capsules in routine&#xD;
      treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke in Vietnam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY BACKGROUND Globally, cerebrovascular disease (stroke) is the second leading cause of&#xD;
      death. According to the latest WHO data published in April 2011, stroke deaths in Vietnam&#xD;
      reached 33,929 or 6.39% of total deaths. About 87% of strokes are caused by ischemia, mainly&#xD;
      atherosclerotic cerebral infarction and transient ischemic attack.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panax notoginseng is an important medicinal plant of the Araliacease family which has been&#xD;
      used in China quite extensively as an herb since the end of the 19th century. Panax&#xD;
      notoginseng traditionally believed can activate blood circulation and increase blood flow,&#xD;
      dilating blood vessels, improves hemodynamics. Triterpene saponins are the bioactive&#xD;
      constituents in Panax notoginseng. It contains high levels of notoginsenoside R1,&#xD;
      ginsenosides Rb1, Rd and Rg1. Panax notoginseng has been reported to have anti-thrombotic&#xD;
      effect via inhibiting thrombosis (inhibition rate: 92.1%). Inhibition of platelet aggregation&#xD;
      and coagulation in rabbit's blood induced by ADP and arachidonic acid (up to 83.7%) was&#xD;
      found. Increased t-PA activity was also found and coagulation time was prolonged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Panax notoginseng was reported to have anti-inflammatory effects in atherosclerosis process,&#xD;
      as well as inhibit inflammatory response in cerebral ischemia and infarction. Panax&#xD;
      notoginseng antagonizes and attenuate delayed cerebral neuronal damage induced by blood&#xD;
      reperfusion in cerebral ischemia. It was found to block neutrophil and macrophage activation,&#xD;
      aggregation and infiltration induced by decreased releasing of serum interleukin-8. It can&#xD;
      also reduce the quantity of Ca2+ in ischemic cerebral tissue, reduce cerebral edema and&#xD;
      improve stroke symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      LUOTAI is the brand name of Panax notoginseng finished product, LUOTAI has been registered in&#xD;
      Vietnam since 2012 with two kinds of formulation are available. The lyophilized powder for&#xD;
      Injection and gelatin based soft capsule. They are currently being used for decreasing&#xD;
      incidence of cerebral infarction or ischemic stroke, including TIA, due to thrombosis and&#xD;
      atherosclerosis. It can alleviate the symptoms secondary to stroke attack. Also reduce the&#xD;
      risk of stroke re-attack in patients who are recently experienced cerebral infarction or&#xD;
      ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is conducted to accumulate effectiveness and safety data of LUOTAI products in the&#xD;
      real life clinical setting. This study will be carried out in approximately 360 patients with&#xD;
      acute stroke in 6 hospitals in Vietnam - Bạch Mai Hospital, 108 Military Hospital, 103&#xD;
      Military Hospital, Trung Vuong Hospital, Phu Tho General Hospital, 115 Hospital in Vietnam&#xD;
      where LUOTAI (and other drugs) being used as a part of their clinical practice for acute&#xD;
      stroke treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY RATIONALE The overall goal of this prospective study is to monitor the effectiveness&#xD;
      and safety of LUOTAI therapy when administered alone or in combination with other drugs,&#xD;
      compared with treatments without LUOTAI in the real life clinical practice. Selection of an&#xD;
      open label, observational design to capture data is recommended for post-marketing studies.&#xD;
      To overcome the bias in observational design, which is also the main and inherent constraint&#xD;
      of open-label design, the study will perform blind evaluations: after three months of&#xD;
      treatment, the patient's assessment using Modified Rankin Score (mRS), a widely accepted&#xD;
      primary outcome parameter, will be conducted by a blind, independent physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-interventional study to observe clinical routine practice. No additional risks&#xD;
      expectedly to be induced to the study participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES AND ENDPOINTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;

      treatment for acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary effectiveness endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Categorical shift in mRS score at 3 months (ordinal logistic regression analysis of the mRS&#xD;

      Ordinal NIHSS at 3 months after stroke onset; Ordinal MoCA at 3 months after stroke onset;&#xD;
      Home time (number of nights among the first 90 days after stroke onset that the patient stays&#xD;
      in his/her home or their relative home)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mortality AE/SAE, ADR, SADR, SUSAR&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN This is a non-interventional, controlled, open-label (blinded assessor),&#xD;
      prospective, multicenter, observational registry study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients receive acute stroke care according to local treatment standard, not amended or&#xD;
      influenced by the study. LUOTAI group comprises of patients who are treated with LUOTAI (and&#xD;
      other concomitant medications) with dosage, dosing schedule and duration follows local&#xD;
      clinical practice in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization. Control&#xD;
      group comprises of patients who are not treated with LUOTAI. Lifestyle modifications will not&#xD;
      be affected by the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The included patients shall follow standard hospital practices and is not determined by the&#xD;
      study plan. Therefore, randomization and blinding procedures are not applicable for this&#xD;
      study. To minimize the limitation of assessment bias in observational studies, the modified&#xD;
      Rankin Scale (mRS) will be assessed by an Independent Study Doctor in a single blind manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage, dosing schedule, duration and administration route of LUOTAI follow the local&#xD;
      hospital practice in accordance with the terms of the local marketing authorization in&#xD;
      Vietnam: 400mg of LUOTAI injectable lyophilized powder diluted in 250ml of 5% Glucose&#xD;
      Solution or 0.9% Normal Saline for included diabetic patients, via slow intravenous infusion,&#xD;
      once daily for consecutive 14 days, and followed by 200mg of LUOTAI soft capsules, three&#xD;
      times a day for 65 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A participant is considered to have completed the study if he or she has completed the last&#xD;
      scheduled procedures on D90.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY ASSESSMENTS AND PROCEDURES No additional diagnostic, treatment or monitoring procedures&#xD;
      will be available in addition to the hospital internal practice guidelines used by the&#xD;
      patients enrolled in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests used in this study to evaluate effectiveness follow the recommendations of various&#xD;
      stroke guidelines: the NIHSS, Modified Rankin Score (mRS), Cognitive impairment, IQCODE to&#xD;
      assess cognitive dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety will be evaluated in this study through the monitoring of all serious and non-serious&#xD;
      adverse events defined and graded according to CTCAE v4.01. Patients will be assessed for&#xD;
      safety (including laboratory values) according to the study visit schedule. Laboratory values&#xD;
      must be reviewed post-baseline compared with baseline to identify clinically significant&#xD;
      changes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following endpoints will be used for safety assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mortality&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  AEs, SAEs, ADRs, SADRs&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  SUSARs to LUOTAI All adverse events, whether reported by the patient or noted by study&#xD;
           personnel, will be recorded in the patient's medical record and on the Adverse Event&#xD;
           CRF. After informed consent has been obtained but prior to initiation of study drug,&#xD;
           only serious adverse events caused by a protocol-mandated intervention (e.g., invasive&#xD;
           procedures such as biopsies, discontinuation of medications) should be reported.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Discontinuation from LUOTAI or other medications does not mean discontinuation from the&#xD;
      study, and remaining study procedures should be completed as indicated by the study protocol.&#xD;
      The data to be collected at the time of study treatment discontinuation will include the&#xD;
      procedures of End of Treatment Visit (D90).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All possible actions must be taken if a participant fails to return to the clinic for a&#xD;
      required study visit, and be documented in the participant's medical record or study file.&#xD;
      Should the participant continue to be unreachable, he or she will be considered to have&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study with a primary reason of lost to follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. STATISTICAL HYPOTHESES This study will test the hypothesis that patients who used LUOTAI&#xD;
           will have lower mRS score after 90 days compared to those who did not use LUOTAI. The&#xD;
           categorical shift in mRS score in ordinal logistic regression analysis of the mRS on D90&#xD;
           (LUOTAI versus non-LUOTAI) will be tested at 0.6.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Primary Efficacy Endpoint Categorical shift in mRS score at 3 months (ordinal&#xD;
                logistic regression analysis of the mRS on D90)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Secondary Efficacy Endpoint Proportion of patients with excellent recovery at 3&#xD;
                months after stroke onset (mRC=0 or 1) Proportion of patients with functional&#xD;
                dependence at 3 months after stroke onset (mRC=0-2) Ordinal ARAT at 3 months after&#xD;
                stroke onset Ordinal NIHSS at 3 months after stroke onset Ordinal MoCA at 3 months&#xD;
                after stroke onset Home time (number of nights among the first 90 days after stroke&#xD;
                onset that the patient stays in his/her home or their relative home)&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety Endpoint Mortality AE/SAE, ADR, SADR, SUSAR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SAMPLE SIZE DETERMINATION Approximately 360 patients will be enrolled in order to have&#xD;
           completed data of 340 patients at D90, in which it is expected that 170 patients are in&#xD;
           LUOTAI group and 170 patients are in the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this observational study is indicative. Nevertheless, the justification&#xD;
      below support the sample size, number of study sites and the enrollment duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size of 170 patients per group will have a power of more than 80% to detect an&#xD;
      ordinal odds ratio (assuming proportional odds ratios) of approximately 0.60&#xD;
      (control/treatment) with ordinal logistic regression analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bias Control Measures: Patients will be enrolled in an unbiased manner, by consecutive&#xD;
      sampling at each site. Assessment of the primary outcome (mRS) will be handled by arranging&#xD;
      objective, blinded outcome assessment by an independent observer. Other aspects of care than&#xD;
      the administration of the study drug may vary between groups. Analyses will consider these&#xD;
      potential source of variation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis: Propensity score matching model will be used to minimize enrollment&#xD;
      bias. Ordinal Logistic Regression of the modified Rankin Scale with adjustment for baseline&#xD;
      factors which are retained in the Propensity Score Matching model will be used as primary&#xD;
      analysis. The baseline factors are always included baseline NIHSS and age.&#xD;
