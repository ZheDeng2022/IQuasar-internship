  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is an enveloped, single strand, positive sense RNA flavivirus.&#xD;
      Infection by HCV is typically chronic, although an estimated ~10-20% may spontaneously clear&#xD;
      the virus. HCV affects between 1.3 - 2 billion individuals, or 2-3% of the global population.&#xD;
      HCV has a seroprevalence of approximately 1% in developed countries such as the US and Korea.&#xD;
      Chronic HCV infection leads to hepatic fibrosis and cirrhosis. This Phase I study will&#xD;
      evaluate the safety, tolerability and immunogenicity of GLS-6150 administered intradermally&#xD;
      (ID) followed by electroporation at 1.0 mg and 2.0 mg/dose assessing 3 and 4-dose regimens.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HCV-003 will assess the safety and immunogenicity of GLS-6150 in those previously treated for&#xD;
      HCV infection and who have achieved a sustained virologic response (SVR). This study will&#xD;
      provide information as to whether GLS-6150 may be useful to prevent re-infection for those&#xD;
      successfully cleared of HCV infection. GLS-6150 is a DNA plasmid vaccine that expresses the&#xD;
      NS3/4A gene of HCV, NS4B gene of HCV, the NS5A gene of HCV and IL-28B. GLS-6150 will be&#xD;
      administered at one of two dose levels (1 mg or 2 mg) and given as a 2 or 3 vaccination&#xD;
      priming regimen with a boost vaccination given at 6 months. Immune T cell and serologic&#xD;
      responses will be determined after each dose.&#xD;
