      Consenting adult female patient felt by the provider to require gonorrhea/chlamydia&#xD;
      endocervical testing will be asked to provide an additional self sample specimen. The&#xD;
      specimen will be sent to the laboratory using conventional diagnostic test for&#xD;
      gonorrhea/chlamydia.&#xD;

      Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial emergency department history and physical examination (standard procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. Provider identifies patient who is felt to require gonorrhea/chlamydia testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
           i. Provider will contact study staff to consent patient. b. Study staff identifies&#xD;
           patient who is felt by provider to require gonorrhea/chlamydia testing. i. Study staff&#xD;
           will ask provider if they could move forward with consenting patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
           c. Provider who is study staff identifies patient who is felt to require&#xD;
           gonorrhea/chlamydia testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Study staff will attempt to consent patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. If inclusion criteria are met, and there are no exclusion criteria, written&#xD;
                informed consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. If the patient changes her mind and refuses consent at this point, a notation is&#xD;
                written on the front of the research packet, and it is turned in with a refusal&#xD;
                notice on the packet.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  If patient refuses to participate in the self-sampling portion of the study,&#xD;
                     we will ask patients if they would like to fill out the first half of the&#xD;
                     patient survey that will contain no personal identification information&#xD;
                     besides their initials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. If patient agrees to participate in the self-sampling, the patient is asked to fill out&#xD;
           both page one and page two of the survey after consent is obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. An attempt is made to write down at least two contact telephone numbers for patients who&#xD;
           have given informed consent on page 2 of the patient survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The patient obtains vaginal self-sample in the restroom/exam room.&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. A preprinted single-use instruction sheet is given to patient detailing sample&#xD;
                collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Vaginal self-sampling collection container has preprinted instructions/requisition&#xD;
                and a preprinted label on the Cepheid sample tube to the lab denoting this as&#xD;
                research sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Paper requisition form is also included with the sample which helps with&#xD;
                documentation and assigning this sample to be billed to the research study and not&#xD;
                to the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. The patient returns the collection container after obtaining the sample to study&#xD;
                staff that consented the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. The collection container will be sent to the lab via pneumatic tube station.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Vaginal self-sampling result is documented in Epic with designation showing&#xD;
                differentiation from provider-performed endocervical sampling.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Provider-performed endocervical sampling is performed once the patient is assigned a&#xD;
           provider and given a private area to conduct a provider-performed endocervical sampling&#xD;
           (standard procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
           a. The collection container is sent to the lab, and the final result is noted in the&#xD;
           medical record as per standard practice (standard procedure).&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Retrospective chart review is performed three days after patient consented in order to&#xD;
           obtain provider-performed endocervical sampling results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Patient will be contacted only if there is a false-negative. A positive with either the&#xD;
           self-sample or provider collected sample is considered positive, and patient will not be&#xD;
           called back about that&#xD;

    <measure>Noninferiority of vaginal self-sampling compared to provider performed endocervical sampling for gonorrhea/chlamydia diagnosis</measure>
    <time_frame>2-3 days</time_frame>
    <description>In order for vaginal self-sampling to be considered clinically noninferior to the standard provider-performed endocervical sampling method of collection, we established a minimum sensitivity of 90%. This was based on previous research showing Sexually Transmitted Infection (STI) clinicians' top priority for a point of care STI test is a minimum sensitivity of 90%. In addition, a previous ED study examining urine gonorrhea/chlamydia diagnosis using the same point of care test as this study also used a minimum sensitivity of 90%. (9) Thus, our primary outcome measure was examining for the noninferiority of VSS sensitivity for gonorrhea/chlamydia, with noninferiority being demonstrated if the sensitivity is &gt;=90%.</description>
