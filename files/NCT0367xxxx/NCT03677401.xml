    <measure>Percent of Participants With Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) 4-point Responder Rate at Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>During the study, WI-NRS assessments were reported by the participant via eDiary once daily from screening/mid-screening visit through the follow-up visit. The Itch NRS is a validated, self reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity and participants were asked to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11- point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. A participant was a 4-point responder if their change from baseline is ≤ -4 (i.e. a decrease of at least 4).</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) to Week 10</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 10</time_frame>
    <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a dermatology specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the skin disease on a participant's QoL over the prior week. It is a ten item questionnaire that assesses overall QoL and six aspects that may affect QoL (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment). The DLQI questions are rated by the participant as 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating poor QoL.).</description>

    <time_frame>At Weeks 2, 4 and 10</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA PN-S is an instrument used to assess the overall number and thickness of PN lesions at a given time point, as determined by the investigator. It consists of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). Higher scores indicate severe prurigo nodularis.</description>

    <time_frame>At Weeks 2, 4, and 10</time_frame>
    <description>The IGA PN-A is an instrument used to assess the overall activity of PN lesions at a given time point, as determined by the investigator. It consists of a 5-point scale ranging from 0 (clear) to 4 (severe). Higher scores indicate severe prurigo nodularis.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-emergent Adverse Events and Serious Adverse Events (SAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From screening until the Follow-up (F/U) visit which occurred 35 days (+ 7 days) after the Week 10 visit or the last dose of study drug for participants who discontinued study drug early</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs) were recorded from the first study drug administration through the follow-up visit. Severity of all AEs were graded using the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v4.03. During the period between informed consent and first study drug dose, only SAEs caused by a protocol-mandated intervention were collected.</description>

      <recruitment_details>The study was conducted at 40 sites in US from 29 August 2018 to 06 February 2020. All psrticipants who met the study entry criteria were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive daily oral doses of serlopitant 5 mg or placebo.</recruitment_details>
      <pre_assignment_details>During the screening period (4 weeks), all participants were evaluated for eligibility and chronic pruritic conditions frequently associated with Prurigo Nodularis. Participants were to complete an electronic diary (eDiary) at the Screening visit.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Percent of Participants With Worst Itch Numeric Rating Scale (WI-NRS) 4-point Responder Rate at Week 10</title>
        <description>During the study, WI-NRS assessments were reported by the participant via eDiary once daily from screening/mid-screening visit through the follow-up visit. The Itch NRS is a validated, self reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity and participants were asked to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11- point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. A participant was a 4-point responder if their change from baseline is ≤ -4 (i.e. a decrease of at least 4).</description>

        <description>During the study, WI-NRS assessments were reported by the participant via eDiary once daily from screening/mid-screening visit through the follow-up visit. The Itch NRS is a validated, self reported, instrument for measurement of itch intensity and participants were asked to rate the intensity of their itch on an 11- point scale ranging from 0 (no itch) to 10 (worst itch imaginable); higher scores indicated greater itch intensity. A participant was a 3-point responder if their change from baseline is ≤ -3 (i.e. a decrease of at least 3).</description>

        <description>Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) is a dermatology specific quality of life (QoL) instrument designed to assess the impact of the skin disease on a participant's QoL over the prior week. It is a ten item questionnaire that assesses overall QoL and six aspects that may affect QoL (symptoms and feelings, daily activities, leisure, work or school performance, personal relationships, and treatment). The DLQI questions are rated by the participant as 0 (not at all) to 3 (very much). Scores range from 0 to 30 with higher scores indicating poor QoL.).</description>
