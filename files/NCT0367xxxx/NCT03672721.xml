    <textblock>
      Treatment of glioblastoma involves an optimal surgery, followed by a combination of radiation&#xD;
      and temozolomide chemotherapy. Progression-free survival (PFS) with this treatment is only&#xD;
      6.9 months and relapse is the norm. The rationale behind the fact that limited chemotherapy&#xD;
      agents are available in the treatment of malignant gliomas is related to the blood-brain&#xD;
      barrier (BBB), which limits drug entry to the brain. Intraarterial (IA) chemotherapy allows&#xD;
      to circumvent this. Using IA delivery of carboplatin, the investigators have observed&#xD;
      responses in 70% of patients for a median PFS of 5 months. Median survival from study entry&#xD;
      was 11 months, whereas the overall survival 23 months. How can we improve on this? By&#xD;
      coupling radiation with a chemotherapeutic which is also a potent radiosensitizer such as&#xD;
      carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: In this phase I/II trial, patients will be treated at recurrence; a surgery&#xD;
      will be performed for cytoreduction and to obtain tumor sample, followed with a combination&#xD;
      of re-irradiation and IA carboplatin chemotherapy. A careful escalation scheme from&#xD;
      1.5Gy/fraction up to 3.5Gy/fraction will allow the investigators to determine the optimal&#xD;
      re-irradiation dose (10 fractions of radiation over 2 weeks). Toxicity will be assessed&#xD;
      according to the NCIC common toxicity criteria. Combined with radiation, patients will&#xD;
      receive 2 treatments of IA carboplatin, 400 mg/m2, 4 hours prior to the first and the sixth&#xD;
      radiation fraction. IA treatments will then be continued on a monthly basis, up to a total of&#xD;
      12 months, or until progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measurements: Tumor response will be evaluated using the RANO criteria by magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging monthly. The investigators will also acquire a sequence that enables the&#xD;
      measurement of cerebral blood flow, cerebral blood volume and blood vessel permeability that&#xD;
      are all relevant to understand the delivery of therapeutics to the CNS. Primary outcome will&#xD;
      be OS and PFS. Secondary outcome will be QOL, neurocognition, and carboplatin delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In vitro intracellular carboplatin accumulation: Tumor samples from re-operation will be be&#xD;
      analyzed for intracellular Pt concentration by ICP-MS. The amount of Pt bound to DNA will be&#xD;
      measured. The level of apoptosis will be determined for each of the sample.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Putting together these data will allow to correlate clinical and radiological response to&#xD;
      QOL, NC (MOCA), and to delivery surrogates for the IA infusion and intracellular penetration&#xD;
      of carboplatin.&#xD;

      A phase II study in relapsing glioblastomas (GBM) using concurrent intraarterial carboplatin&#xD;
      chemoradiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BACKGROUND - Contemporary treatment of GBM brain tumors involves a first-line treatment in&#xD;
      which the patient receives a surgical procedure followed by a combination of radiation and&#xD;
      temozolomide-based chemotherapy1. Unfortunately, this regimen improves patient survival only&#xD;
      modestly, with a progression-free survival (PFS) of 6 months, and an overall survival of 14&#xD;
      months. Glioblastoma remains an incurable disease characterized by relapse and disease&#xD;
      progression. There is no established second-line treatment for relapsing GBM, and the most&#xD;
      used (BCNU chemotherapy) results in a PFS of only 2 months. As the investigators have shown,&#xD;
      treatment can be considerably improved by circumventing the limitation of chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      agents(CA) to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and enter the central nervous system (CNS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have focused its research on 3 essential aspects of GBM treatment: 1)&#xD;
      alternate delivery approaches to bypass the BBB; 2) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to&#xD;
      characterize tumor blood supply and predict therapeutics delivery to the tumor; 3)&#xD;
      synergestic interplay of radiation and platinum drugs to improve brain tumor therapy. This is&#xD;
      the first study to ever attempt bridging these 3 aspects within the same project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternate delivery approaches to bypass the BBB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although different approaches have been tested in the researcher's lab to bypass the BBB, the&#xD;
      most applicable to the clinic is the intraarterial infusion of chemotherapy (IA). It allows&#xD;
      to circumvent the BBB via the first pass effect, resulting in a local plasma peak&#xD;
      concentration increase of the CA by up to a 5-fold factor, maximizing CNS drug exposure. It&#xD;
      also decreases systemic distribution of the CA thereby reducing toxicities and side effects.&#xD;
      Over the last 15 years, the principal investigator has treated more than 720 patients using&#xD;
      this IA approach, 422 of which had glioblastoma. This is the largest of such series. Based on&#xD;
      this extensive experience, the investigators have convincingly shown that the procedure is&#xD;
      safe and well tolerated. Using IA carboplatin in GBM relapse, a response in 70% of patients,&#xD;
      and a 22 months overall survival + an increase in PFS to 5 months has been observed. This&#xD;
      represents an impressive survival increase of 9 months. Time is ripe to improve these results&#xD;
      in hope to cure this hard-to-treat cancer someday; hence the 2 additional measures discussed&#xD;
      next.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRI characterization. MRI is routinely used to monitor GBM response to treatment. It could&#xD;
      also help us guide treatment and predict responses. Indeed, the investigators have recently&#xD;
      developed a novel MRI sequence that enables the simultaneous measurement of cerebral blood&#xD;
      flow (CBF), cerebral blood volume (CBV) and vessel permeability; these surrogates are all&#xD;
      relevant to predict delivery of therapeutics to CNS tumors. This sequence has been tested and&#xD;
      has met strict quality criteria. This will help decide the artery into which IA chemotherapy&#xD;
      is delivered, and predict CA delivery and possibly tumor response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Synergistic interplay of radiation and platinum drugs. Radiotherapy is the most effective&#xD;
      single-treatment modality for GBM tumors, but it controls the disease only transiently. A way&#xD;
      to improve treatment consists of coupling radiation with a potent radiosensitizer.&#xD;
      Carboplatin (Ca), a platinum (Pt) drug, is ideally suited for this7. Our group has&#xD;
      demonstrated that the addition of Ca to ionizing radiation produced significantly more DNA&#xD;
      strand breaks. In numerous cell lines, combining radiotherapy and Ca was found to increase&#xD;
      cell death. In a mouse model, the investigators observed a maximum antitumor effect with&#xD;
      Pt-Ca administration at 4 h or 48 h prior to irradiation. This timing correlated to the&#xD;
      highest levels of Pt bound to DNA. Concurrent Pt-Ca and radiation treatment represents a&#xD;
      common modality for treating a variety of cancers. Unfortunately, since this class of drug&#xD;
      does not readily cross the BBB when administered via the standard iv routes, they are not&#xD;
      used to treat GBM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After years of interdisciplinary collaboration, the investigators demonstrated the following&#xD;
      key factors in our pre-clinical F98-Fischer GBM model: 1- the use of the IA route increased&#xD;
      Ca accumulation into the nucleus of tumor cells by a whooping 20-fold factor compared to the&#xD;
      iv route. 2- While testing for 5 different Platinum compounds administered to the CNS by&#xD;
      different routes, radiotherapy, IA carboplatin + radiotherapy was by far the best therapeutic&#xD;
      modality in terms OS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AIM - To conduct a phase I/II clinical study in which: (1) patients with relapsing GBM will&#xD;
      be treated with a novel IA chemoradiation with Ca. (2) the new MRI sequence will be used to&#xD;
      maximize the intraarterial catheter position in relation to individual tumor vasculature.&#xD;
      Moreover, the investigators will assess whether the sequence can serve as a predictor of Ca&#xD;
      delivery to the CNS, tumor response and patients survival. (3) Using tumor sample of each&#xD;
      patient, to proceed to in vitro analysis of efflux pumps expression levels, DNA-bound Ca&#xD;
      levels, and in vitro radiation linked to cell death study to predict in vivo tumor response.&#xD;
      With this structuring and translational project, the investigators ultimate goal is to&#xD;
      personalize GBM treatment for each patient based on the MRI and in vitro biological data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HYPOTHESES - (1) IA Ca will show strong synergy with radiation and will act as a potent&#xD;
      radiosensitizer. (2) MRI data analysis on blood flow, volume and vessel permeability will&#xD;
      predict the extent of delivery of Ca to the tumor and the level of hypoxia affecting&#xD;
      radiation effectiveness. Hence, this should allow to predict response to treatment. It will&#xD;
      also help maximize the catheter position in the cerebral vascular tree. (3) In vitro&#xD;
      intracellular penetration of carboplatin and radiation testing, as well as expression of&#xD;
      efflux pumps will predict treatment effectiveness and time-correlate Ca binding to DNA with&#xD;
      cell entrance flux. Putting together these data will allow correlating clinical and&#xD;
      radiological response to quality of life (QOL), and to delivery surrogates for the IA&#xD;
      infusion and intracellular penetration of carboplatin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: IA carboplatin and radiation - Patients with GBM progressing after the first&#xD;
      line of treatment will be eligible. In this phase I/II trial, all patients will be treated at&#xD;
      recurrence; a surgery will be performed for cytoreduction during which tumor samples will be&#xD;
      collected, followed by a combination of radiation and IA Ca. A dose escalation protocol with&#xD;
      consideration of the cumulative biologically effective dose and the normalized total dose&#xD;
      will be used to determine the optimal re-irradiation dose in terms of acceptable toxicity and&#xD;
      efficacy. We will use 10 fractions of radiation over 2 weeks. This will allow to benefit from&#xD;
      the protective effects of fractionation (normal tissue repair), while being tolerable in the&#xD;
      preservation of QOL. Escalation scheme from 1.5Gy/fraction up to 3.5Gy/fraction will allow us&#xD;
      to control for neurotoxicity. A 12 weeks observational period has been planned between each&#xD;
      escalation to detect any undesired toxicity. Toxicity will be graded according to the&#xD;
      National Cancer Institute (NCI) common toxicity criteria and grade III or IV will be&#xD;
      considered significant. Pending the occurrence of such toxicity, the patient will be&#xD;
      withdrawn from the study. Moreover, 3 instances of a grade III or IV toxicity will halt the&#xD;
      escalation scheme. The prior radiation dose level will then be considered as the established&#xD;
      safe level, and 10 more patients will be accrued at this level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combined with radiation, patients will receive 2 treatments of IA carboplatin12 (400 mg/m2),&#xD;
      4 hours prior to the first and the sixth radiation fraction (of a total of 10). IA treatments&#xD;
      will then be continued on a monthly basis as a single treatment modality for consolidation,&#xD;
      up to a total of 12 months, or until progression.&#xD;
