      Since medical therapies offer only modest palliation and minimal hopes for improved survival&#xD;
      to COPD patients, surgical therapies have been designed that may provide greater benefits in&#xD;
      selected patients. Lung transplantation, for example, clearly improves survival and quality&#xD;
      of life in patients with end stage COPD. This comes at substantial economic cost, however, as&#xD;
      well as the at the cost of complications that may result from the complex surgery and from&#xD;
      life-long immunosuppression. In addition, nearly all lung transplants will fail within 5&#xD;
      years as a result of progressive bronchiolotis obliterans, which we currently have no way to&#xD;
      prevent or treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second operation designed to treat severe COPD patients is lung volume reduction surgery&#xD;
      (LVRS). This operation, designed for patients with predominant emphysema rather than chronic&#xD;
      bronchitis, is among the most carefully studied operations ever developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We believe that by reducing the volume of emphysematous lung with the precise target&#xD;
      localization made possible by image-guided SABR, that we will be able to duplicate the&#xD;
      benefits of surgical lung volume reduction with far less risk. We believe that this may&#xD;
      represent a major advance in the therapy of emphysema - a highly prevalent disease. It may&#xD;
      provide not only palliation but also increased survival, as does surgical lung volume&#xD;
      reduction, in carefully selected patients.&#xD;

      Stereotactic Ablative Radiotherapy (SABR), also called stereotactic body radiation therapy&#xD;
      (SBRT), is a relatively recent advance in radiotherapy which allows high doses of radiation&#xD;
      to be transmitted to focused areas (typically malignancies), allowing higher rates of&#xD;
      tumoricidal activity, generally lower complications, and greater convenience for patients&#xD;
      since it can be delivered in 1 to just a few sessions. As the radiation is administered from&#xD;
      multiple directions according to stereotactic planning, high doses can be delivered to the&#xD;
      tissues with rapid fall-off to relatively low doses in even nearby, surrounding normal&#xD;
      tissues. This technique was initially applied to brain tumors- an application which over the&#xD;
      years has met with great success. More recently, it has been applied with substantial success&#xD;
      and is gaining increasing acceptance as a primary mode of therapy for stage I lung&#xD;
      malignancies, and malignancies in multiple other body areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the lung, the rate of pneumonitis resulting from SABR is far lower than the rates incurred&#xD;
      by conventional external beam radiotherapy. In conventional external beam radiotherapy&#xD;
      reported pneumonitis rates range from 13-37% (7), depending on dose and field size. Reported&#xD;
      rates of symptomatic pneumonitis after lung SABR are significantly lower and generally are&#xD;
      ~5% (8). SABR does, however, typically leave a scar in the area of lung that has been treated&#xD;
      (9). Importantly, there appears to be contraction of surrounding lung parenchyma into this&#xD;
      scar resulting in an effect that is essentially a &quot;lung volume reduction.&quot; One often sees&#xD;
      clear loss of lung volume following any form of lung radiotherapy. With SABR, this &quot;volume&#xD;
      reduction&quot; is achieved with a far lower risk of morbidity - in particular, less risk of&#xD;
      pneumonitis.&#xD;
