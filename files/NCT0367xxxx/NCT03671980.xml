      6 month exploratory feasibility study to assess if a combination of MyMedicalRecord supported&#xD;
      self-management website and a home faecal calprotectin smartphone testing kit is a feasible&#xD;
      and acceptable means for patients to monitor for signs of relapse after treatment&#xD;
      de-escalation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      IBD can be challenging to manage as disease flares are often unpredictable and rarely&#xD;
      coincide with scheduled outpatient appointments. Websites are a novel way of assisting&#xD;
      patients to take more control over monitoring and managing symptoms and have been shown to&#xD;
      improve outcomes in some chronic diseases. The My Medical Record (MyMR) webiste was developed&#xD;
      to help patients learn about IBD, access test results, monitor symptoms, and manage their&#xD;
      medications, with email support from the IBD team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of home faecal calprotectin monitoring will also be explored. This marker of IBD&#xD;
      activity is normally performed in hospital laboratories and becomes elevated before the onset&#xD;
      of clinical symptoms of an IBD flare. New technologies enable patients to perform the test at&#xD;
      home with the aid of a smartphone application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 6 month exploratory feasibility study will be conducted to assess if a combination of MyMR&#xD;
      and a home faecal testing kit is a feasible and acceptable means for patients to monitor&#xD;
      their illness. Their use will be targeted to patients who have recently stopped (or reduced)&#xD;
      a treatment for IBD, as up to 50% of these patients may have a disease flare within a year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinic appointments Study participants will not be required to attend any routine&#xD;
           outpatient follow up appointments for the 6 month study period, after which they will be&#xD;
           reviewed by a member of the IBD team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires and interviews Partcipants will receive questionnaires and a sample will&#xD;
           also undergo interviews to explore their views regarding the website and stool test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Website&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be encouraged to use all functions of the website at least monthly:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Secure email messaging service&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. IBD educational material&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Stool, nutritional and flare journals&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Blood and test results&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Faecal calprotectin monitoring - monthly testing (or sooner if symptoms of a flare-up)&#xD;
           using QuantonCal home faecal calprotectin smartphone application. Participants will test&#xD;
           and monitor their FC levels monthly. The results will be overseen by the IBD team who&#xD;
           will make contact within a week in the event of abnormal results if the participant has&#xD;
           not already done so.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Blood tests All participants will have a routine blood test at 0 and 6 months.&#xD;
                Those taking azathioprine, mercaptopurine and methotrexate should continue regular&#xD;
                blood monitoring (minimum of 3 monthly FBC, U&amp;E, LFT and CRP) as usual practice.&#xD;
                Participants will be provided with blood test results and explanations of their&#xD;
                significance via MyMR. The results will be overseen by the IBD team who will make&#xD;
                contact within a week in the event of abnormal results if the patient has not&#xD;
                already done so.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Safety Patients can contact the IBD team the email messaging service at any time&#xD;
                for advice and support.&#xD;
