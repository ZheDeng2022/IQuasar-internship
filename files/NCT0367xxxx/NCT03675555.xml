      This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of a prophylactic dose of oral mirtazapine on&#xD;
      shivering compared with prophylactic intravenous infusion (IVI) dexamethasone in patients&#xD;
      undergoing gynecological surgeries under spinal anesthesia.&#xD;

      Enrollment After approval by the institute ethics committee, this study was conducted at&#xD;
      Ain-Shams university hospitals, from the 1st of March 2018 till the 31st of August 2018, on&#xD;
      300 patients aged 18-60 years of the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical&#xD;
      status I or II and underwent gynecological surgeries under spinal anesthesia. A written&#xD;
      informed consent was obtained from all patients to participate in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient's refusal, duration of surgery more than 120 min, obesity with body mass index (BMI)&#xD;
      &gt;35 kg/m2, generalized infection or localized infection at level of blockade, neurologic&#xD;
      disease, coagulation disorder, patients with hypo- or hyperthyroidism, cardiopulmonary&#xD;
      disease, psychological disorders, a need for blood transfusion during surgery, an initial&#xD;
      body temperature &gt;38.0C or &lt;36.0C, a known history of alcohol or substance abuse, or&#xD;
      receiving vasodilators, or medications likely to alter thermoregulation excluded the patient&#xD;
      from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization and Blinding This study was designed to be a randomized, placebo-controlled,&#xD;
      double-blinded parallel study. Following enrollment, patients were randomized into 3 equal&#xD;
      groups;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The M (Mirtazapine) (Merta) group:(n=100) each patient received 30 mg Mirta tablet&#xD;
           orally with sips of water and 100 ml 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline [NS]) (IVI)&#xD;
           over 15 min as a placebo for Dex 2 h preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. The D (Dexamethasone) (Dex) group: (n=100) each patient received a placebo tablet&#xD;
           identical to Mirta tablet orally with sips of water and Dex 8 mg ampoule diluted in 100&#xD;
           ml 0.9% NS IVI over 15 min, 2 h preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The C (Control) group: (n=100) each patient received the same placebo tablet identical&#xD;
           to Mirta tablet orally with sips of water and 100 ml 0.9% NS IVI over 15 minas a placebo&#xD;
           for Dex 2 h preoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization was done using computer-generated table of random numbers in a 1:1 ratio in&#xD;
      opaque and sealed envelope (SNOSE). The assigned treatment was written on a card and sealed&#xD;
      in opaque envelopes consecutively numbered. These envelopes were opened just immediately&#xD;
      before infusing the medication in the patient's room. The study drugs were prepared by the&#xD;
      hospital pharmacy and follow-up of patients were conducted by anesthesia residents not&#xD;
      involved in any other part of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Protocol On arrival in the operating theatre, all patients had an inserted venous&#xD;
      cannula. I.V. fluids were preheated to 37oC. No other warming device was used. Lactated&#xD;
      Ringer's solution was warmed to 37 oC and was infused at 10 ml/kg over 30 min before spinal&#xD;
      anesthesia. The infusion rate was reduced to 6 ml/ kg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subarachnoid anesthesia was instituted at either L3/4 or L4/5 interspaces. Hyperbaric&#xD;
      bupivacaine, 5 mg /ml, 15 mg was injected using a 25 G Quincke spinal needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Supplemental oxygen (5 liter/ min) was delivered via a facemask during the operation. All&#xD;
      patients were covered with one layer of surgical drapes over the chest, thighs, and calves&#xD;
      during the operation and one cotton blanket over the entire body after operation. The&#xD;
      operating and recovery rooms temperatures were maintained at 23-25Â°C with approximately 60%&#xD;
      humidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment parameters Heart rate, mean arterial pressure (MAP), and peripheral oxygen&#xD;
      saturation were recorded using standard noninvasive monitors before intrathecal injection and&#xD;
      thereafter at 5, 10, 15, 20 minutes then every 10 minutes to complete 90 minutes from the&#xD;
      intrathecal injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory levels were assessed by pinprick to determine the peak sensory level and time to two&#xD;
      segment regression in minutes. Motor block were assessed by using Modified Bromage scale(16)&#xD;
      (0 = no block 1 = hip block, 2 = hip and knee block, 3 = hip, knee, and ankle block) to&#xD;
      determine the time to reach complete motor block and duration of motor blockade (minutes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sedation score was assessed with a four-point scale as per Filos et al.(17): 1: Awake and&#xD;
      alert. 2: Somnolent, but responsive to verbal stimuli. 3: Somnolent, arousable to physical&#xD;
      stimuli. 4: Unarousable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body temperature (axillary temperature) was recorded with an axillary thermometer. The&#xD;
      ambient temperature was measured by a wall thermometer. The ambient temperature will be&#xD;
      maintained at 25oC with constant humidity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shivering severity was assessed with a four-point scale (Badjatia et al):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. None (Grade 0): no shivering noted on palpation of the masseter, neck, or chest wall&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Mild (Grade 1): shivering localized to the neck and/or thorax only&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Moderate (Grade 2): shivering involved gross movement of the upper extremities (in&#xD;
           addition to neck and thorax)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Severe (Grade 3): shivering involved gross movements of the trunk and upper and lower&#xD;
           extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shivering was assessed immediately before the block and every 10 minutes till the first 90&#xD;
      min (end point of the study) after the completion of the subarachnoid drug injection (start&#xD;
      point of the study). Grade 2 or 3 of shivering score was regarded failure of prophylaxis and&#xD;
      meperidine 25 mg IV was administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Side-effects, including hypotension (defined as a decrease in MAP of more than 20% from&#xD;
      baseline or a decrease of arterial blood pressure below 90 mmHg and baseline MAP was&#xD;
      calculated from three measurements taken on the ward before surgery) was treated by&#xD;
      crystalloid infusion and if necessary ephedrine 5 mg IV was administered. The amount of&#xD;
      ephedrine given in each group was recorded. Bradycardia was considered if the heart rate &lt;50&#xD;
      beats/min and was treated with IV atropine (0.01mg/kg). Respiratory depression (RR &lt; 12 bpm),&#xD;
      incidence of nausea and vomiting during early 2 hours postoperatively were recorded. IV&#xD;
      granisetron (1 mg) was given in case of vomiting or after 2 successive episodes of nausea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' satisfaction with shivering prophylaxis was done by asking the patient to answer&#xD;
      the question, &quot;How would you rate your experience after the surgery?&quot; using a 7-point Likert&#xD;
      verbal rating scale and acceptable satisfaction score of the patient being 5-7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3-Analysis of Data:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data were coded, tabulated, and statistically analyzed using IBM SPSS&#xD;
      statistics (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) software version 22.0, IBM Corp.,&#xD;
      Chicago, USA, 2013.&#xD;
