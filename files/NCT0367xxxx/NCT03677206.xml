  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chronic pain is a major problem in the USA and the rest of the world, currently, all&#xD;
      available pharmacological interventions carry with them significant side effects. Pain&#xD;
      clinics are specially equipped to perform intentional pain procedures to manage pain.&#xD;
      However, there remain groups of patients what neither benefit from pharmacological nor from&#xD;
      interventional pain procedures. Other methods have shown only minor benefits such as hypnosis&#xD;
      or cognitive behavioral therapy. Therefore, other techniques need to be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Light therapy has been shown to have significant biological effects on humans. For example,&#xD;
      light therapy is used to manage depression. Several clinical trials have shown that certain&#xD;
      wavelengths of light can improve wound healing, decrease temporomandibular joint dysfunction&#xD;
      (TMJ) pain, and decrease fear of back pain. In these trials, light was directed at the site&#xD;
      of pain. In an attempt to better understand the effect of different wavelengths of light,&#xD;
      pre-clinical studies were conducted using rats. The investigators have shown green and blue&#xD;
      Light emitting diode, (LED) light produced antinociception (analgesia) and reversed&#xD;
      neuropathic pain associated with several models of chronic pain. The analgesic effect of&#xD;
      light was completely blocked when rats had their eyes covered, this suggests that the&#xD;
      analgesic effects seen are mainly due to systemic effect through the visual system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary experiments on rats suggest that this effect is mediated through the endogenous&#xD;
      opioids and cannabinoid system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that LED light is a safe alternative to pharmacological&#xD;
      intervention to manage pain by stimulating the endogenous endorphin and cannabinoid systems.&#xD;
      The investigators initial target participants with history of HIV, chemotherapy induced&#xD;
      peripheral neuropathy and fibromyalgia. Participants will be divided into 2 groups. The first&#xD;
      group will be a control group exposed to white LED light. The second group will be exposed to&#xD;
      green LED light, respectively. Participants will be asked to take LED light home and will be&#xD;
      asked to set in a dark room for 2 hours daily for 3 months with their LED light on. At the&#xD;
      end of the 3 months trial, the investigator will assess their pain intensity, analgesic use,&#xD;
      and overall quality of life. The investigators hypothesis is that participants exposed to&#xD;
      green and blue light will have less use of analgesics and will have better life quality.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      During the initial visit, the investigator will collect several pieces of data from&#xD;
      participants that are considered part of the routine care, if you are being seen in the&#xD;
      clinic, this information will also be used for research purposes. Initially the investigator&#xD;
      will ask participants to provide their age, gender, work status, disability status, type of&#xD;
      work, whether a previous pain physician has evaluated or provided treatment in the past, if&#xD;
      there is any ongoing litigation, a detailed description of the pain (burning, electrical,&#xD;
      shooting…etc.) and its location. If the participants are being seen in the clinic for their&#xD;
      normal care a detailed physical examination assessing the motor strength of the upper&#xD;
      extremities, sensation to light touch and reflexes that is part of the standard of care will&#xD;
      be provided for the participants. The participants will be asked to give a numerical value&#xD;
      for their pain (a scale from 0-10 where 0 is no pain and 10 is the worst pain imagined). Two&#xD;
      questionnaires will be provided for the participants to complete which are not standard of&#xD;
      care. The first one is the EuroQol Group (EQ-5D) which provide an over assessment of the&#xD;
      quality of life. The second is a medication log to document their analgesics use. If the&#xD;
      participants are being evaluated via telephone call, the same questions will be conducted,&#xD;
      but no physical exam will be provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be assigned to either a white, or green light group. The participants&#xD;
      have 50% chance of being in either group. Once the participants are assigned a light group,&#xD;
      the participants will be given a strip of Light emitting diode, (LED) light that correspond&#xD;
      to their color group. The participants will be asked to take and use the LED strip in a dark&#xD;
      room in their house every day for two hours to be exposed to the light, the participants will&#xD;
      do this for 10 weeks. The study start date and the outcome assessment timeline will begin&#xD;
      from the date of your first exposure to the assigned light. The participants will be asked to&#xD;
      complete their weekly questionnaires and daily log, these will be given to the participants&#xD;
      on their first clinic visit or sent to the participants if they live out of town. There will&#xD;
      be several follow up appointments as detailed below. There is a chance the participants may&#xD;
      be asked to cross over into a different group from the one the participants were assigned,&#xD;
      there will we a 2 week washout period, then return to clinic for light assignment then light&#xD;
      exposure for 10 week, similar visits as described below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the follow up clinic visit or phone call (Week 10), data similar to the information&#xD;
      gathered at the initial visit will be collected. The description of the pain (burning,&#xD;
      electrical, shooting…etc.) and its location will be reviewed. A physical examination&#xD;
      assessing for pain and sensation to light touch that is part of the standard of care will be&#xD;
      provided for the participants. At the end of the study, the participants will be asked to&#xD;
      return the LED strip, their logs and questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an optional blood draw and saliva sample collection for patients that consent to&#xD;
      this. Blood and saliva samples will be collected at baseline and end of study, blood draws&#xD;
      will be done to look for inflammatory mediators, increased anti inflammatory mediators and&#xD;
      endocannabinoids. Saliva samples will be collected to check for melatonin.&#xD;
