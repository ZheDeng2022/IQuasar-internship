  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study is being done so we can determine the quality of the protein present in&#xD;
      Mung beans. Amino acids are the building blocks of protein and protein quality is determined&#xD;
      by the amount of amino acids present and by their bioavailability (their absorption and use&#xD;
      by the body). Some amino acids are essential which means they must be obtained from the diet.&#xD;
      If any one of the essential amino acids is missing in the diet, the body cannot make proteins&#xD;
      that are used to repair tissue build bone, teeth, etcâ€¦ Mung beans as a food source contain&#xD;
      low amounts of the essential amino acid methionine which makes its protein incomplete. The&#xD;
      amino acids in Mung beans are also affected by cooking. Our objective is to determine the&#xD;
      amount of methionine in Mung beans that the body can use. We will test Mung beans by studying&#xD;
      them after cooking them in a stew, on their own and by combining the Mung bean stew with rice&#xD;
      or wheat in a mixed meal to make a more complete protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done in order to bridge the gap between knowledge of protein&#xD;
      requirement and the amount of food needed to meet that requirement. Results from this study&#xD;
      will be important for recommendations guiding food choices of Mung bean as a major protein&#xD;
      source in the diet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previously the quality of dietary protein for human consumption was studied in animals. This&#xD;
      study is being done in humans because studies in animals are not directly applicable to&#xD;
      humans. Plant protein sources like Mung beans are important alternatives to animal protein in&#xD;
      the diet. Plant protein consumption relative to animal protein can contribute to &quot;enhance&#xD;
      ecosystem resilience, and improved human health.&#xD;

      If you agree to take part in this study, you will receive 3 different amounts of Mung beans&#xD;
      which will contain different amounts of the essential amino acid methionine as well as 3&#xD;
      different amount of Mung beans complemented with rice or wheat. The Mung beans will be cooked&#xD;
      in a stew served on its own or served with the rice or wheat. The quality of the protein in&#xD;
      the Mung beans will be compared to the quality of a reference protein (egg protein) by giving&#xD;
      you 4 reference diets containing amino acids patterned after the amino acid content of egg&#xD;
      protein. The amount of Mung beans you receive will be provided in a random order.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Breath samples will be collected after the 4th meal in 15 min intervals for 1 hour. Breath&#xD;
      collection will resume again two and a half hours after the 5th meal every 15 minutes until&#xD;
      30 minutes after the last meal. A total of 52 breath samples will be collected during each of&#xD;
      the 3rd study day.&#xD;

They will then be studied for up to 10 times. levels of phenylalanine intake (7 Study periods). You could be expected to participate in up to 10 different sets of experiments which will take 11 weeks to 6 months. Each set of experiment consists of a 3 day period. During the first 2 days (Adaptation Days) you will be expected to consume 4 meals per day consisting of a protein liquid drink and protein freecookies and/or a Mung bean stew with or without rice or wheat, which will be provided by the investigators</description>
