    <textblock>
      This trial is intended to study the safety and effectiveness of an new anti-epileptic drug&#xD;
      (AED) on Primary Generalized Tonic-Clonic (PGTC) Seizures. Eligible Subjects will continue to&#xD;
      take their usual AEDs and receive either cenobamate or placebo. Subjects will have a 50%&#xD;
      chance or receiving cenobamate or placebo (sugar pill). Subjects will initially receive 12.5&#xD;
      mg of cenobamate or placebo (study drug) and increase the dose every two weeks until they&#xD;
      reach a target dose of 200 mg. Subjects will take study drug at approximately the same time&#xD;
      in the morning (once a day) with or without food. If tolerability issues arise, dosing can be&#xD;
      changed to evening. Also, once a subject reaches 200 mg of study drug, the dose can be&#xD;
      decreased one time to 150 mg, if necessary. The treatment period is 22 weeks and there is a 3&#xD;
      week follow up period, which includes a one week decrease in study drug to 100 mg prior to&#xD;
      stopping. Subjects who complete may be eligible for an extension study and will not have to&#xD;
      complete the follow up period. Subjects will track their seizure types and frequency in a&#xD;
      diary throughout the study.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled trial is designed to look at safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of cenobamate adjunctive therapy as compared to placebo on PGTC seizures in subject&#xD;
      with idiopathic generalized epilepsy. Subjects will be randomized to receive either&#xD;
      cenobamate or placebo on a 1:1 basis. The study will have three periods, pre-randomization&#xD;
      period where a baseline seizure frequency is established, treatment period and follow up&#xD;
      period. The treatment period consists of a 10 week titration phase where subjects are&#xD;
      titrated slowly until they reach the target dose and a maintenance phase. During the&#xD;
      titration phase, subjects will receive 12.5 mg study drug, followed by 25 mg, 50 mg, 100 mg,&#xD;
      and 150 mg study drug every two weeks. During the maintenance phase, subjects will receive&#xD;
      the target dose of 200 mg study drug. Subjects will take their once daily dose of study drug&#xD;
      at approximately the same in the morning with or without food. If tolerability issues arise,&#xD;
      subjects can switch to evening dosing. There is also an option to down-titrate to 150 mg&#xD;
      study drug, one time only. If tolerability issues continue, subjects may be discontinued.&#xD;
      Upon completion of the maintenance phase, eligible subjects will have an opportunity to&#xD;
      enroll in an open-label safety study. Subjects who discontinue early or do not wish to&#xD;
      participate in this additional study will complete the three week follow up period. Subjects&#xD;
      may receive a one week down titration to 100 mg and return for a follow up visit 2 weeks&#xD;
      later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout the study, subjects will keep a diary containing the type and frequency of&#xD;
      seizures. This will be the primary efficacy measure.&#xD;
