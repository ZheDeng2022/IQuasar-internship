      Cesarean delivery is defined as fetal birth through incisions in the abdominal wall and the&#xD;
      uterine wall (hysterotomy). This definition does not include removal of the fetus from the&#xD;
      abdominal cavity in the case of uterine rupture or in the case of an abdominal pregnancy&#xD;

&#xD;
                Severe preeclampsia.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Uterine anomalies.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Women who received anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Blood disorders (e.g. coagulopathies , thrombocytopenia).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Consent&#xD;
&#xD;
                Verbal and written consent were obtained from all eligible women .&#xD;
&#xD;
                The candidate women were divided into two groups. A computer generated random&#xD;
                numerical table was used by an independent statistician to prepare sealed opaque&#xD;
                envelopes containing a group assignment. Two groups of envelopes, corresponding to&#xD;
                two study groups, were given to a third party (a nurse), who was unaware of the&#xD;
                contents. The nurse distributed envelopes to patients, alternating between the&#xD;
                groups. Patientsassigned to group 1 received 5 IU oxytocin IV after delivery of the&#xD;
                fetus+ 2 tabs placepo . Patients assigned to group 2 received 400 in the buccal&#xD;
                space after anaesthesia + Iv saline infusion&#xD;
&#xD;
                Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Cesarean deliveries were performed by well- trained resident doctor supervised by&#xD;
                Assistant lecturer or Obstetrician consultant.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Cesarean section was performed under spinal anesthesia. Novasoconstrictor was used&#xD;
                unless the blood pressure dropped by 20% fromthe baseline value; if this was the&#xD;
                case, 10 mg ephedrine was given.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Cesarean Delivery technique was the same in all recruited women.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Abdominal skin incision was done through a Pfannenstiel incision 2 to 3cm above the&#xD;
                symphysis pubis, with the mid portion of the incision within the shaved area of the&#xD;
                pubic hair for a length of about 10-12cm was done. After the rectus fascia was&#xD;
                opened, the rectus&#xD;
&#xD;
                muscles were separated and dissected off the peritoneum which was&#xD;
&#xD;
                picked up between two tissue forceps and opened longitudinally. The visceral&#xD;
                peritoneum was dissected sharply and gently to separate the bladder from the&#xD;
                uterus. The&#xD;
&#xD;
                uterus was opened through a transverse lower segment incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
                After clamping of the umbilical cord, the women received 1.5 gm Ampicillin&#xD;
                -Sulbactam (Ultracillin, Sedico, Egypt) and 80 mg garamycin (Epigent, EPICO, EGYPT)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Uterine repair by absorbable continuous vicryl 1 sutures in two layers , parietal&#xD;
                peritoneum was sutured by absorbable continuous vicryl sutures, rectus sheath was&#xD;
                closed by absorbable continuous vicryl 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
                subcutaneous fatty layer was closed by absorbable continuous vicryl 0sutures, skin&#xD;
                was closed by vicryl 2-0 by subcuticular sutures.&#xD;
&#xD;
                All the towels were weighed before and after cesarean section and the difference&#xD;
                were calculated, the amount of intraoperative blood loss was estimated in the&#xD;
                suction apparatus in ml. A trained nurse was responsible for blood and amniotic&#xD;
                fluid collection during surgery using two separate suction sets, as well as for&#xD;
                weighing the surgical towels before and after surgery; all towels that were used&#xD;
                were of the same size and weight and every 1 gm increase in weight was equated with&#xD;
                1-mLblood loss. The total amount of intra-operative blood loss was&#xD;
                calculated.(blood loss in suction apparatus plus weight difference of used towels&#xD;
&#xD;
                Second trained nurse was responsible for post-operative external blood loss&#xD;
                measurement during the first 24 hours after surgery by weighing the soaked towels&#xD;
                placed in the vulvar area. The post-operative blood loss was calculated (weight&#xD;
                difference of towels placed in the vulvar area .The overall blood loss was&#xD;
                calculated. Another blood picture was obtained 24 hours postoperative to detect&#xD;
                changes in Hb level. The same nurse was responsible for follow up body temperature&#xD;
                2 hours after caesarean section (feverish if temperature is 38ÂºC or greater) and&#xD;
                observation of the patient for nausea , vomiting , chills and diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Primary outcomes: involved estimation of intraoperative and&#xD;
&#xD;
                postoperative blood loss for 24 hours ( blood loss estimation started immediately&#xD;
                following the skin incision)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Secondary outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Changes in hemoglobin concentration ( hemoglobin concentrations were measured 2&#xD;
                hours before surgery and 24 hours after surgery)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Misoprostol-induced maternal adverse effects (postoperativenausea, vomiting,&#xD;
                diarrhea, fever and chills .&#xD;
&#xD;
                Need to use other uterotonic drugs (oxytocin or ergometrine).Need to do further&#xD;
                surgical interventions ( uterine artery ligation ,hysterectomy or re-exploration of&#xD;
                the patient)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Need for blood transfusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Sample Size:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Sample size was calculated based on the primary outcome (the amount of&#xD;
                intraoperative blood loss during cs ) based on the results of previous study ,the&#xD;
                mean blood loss with the use of Iv oxytocinas588.9ml with a standerd deviation of&#xD;
                96.3 ml (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
                Assuming that buccal misoprostol is more effective in reducing blood loss by 10% 77&#xD;
                participants in each group will have 95% power at significance to detect such a 5%&#xD;
                difference&#xD;
&#xD;
                women were include in each group taking in account a 10% 77 drop-out rate&#xD;
                (Epi-info: centers for disease control and prevention&#xD;
&#xD;
                Atlanta, GA)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Approval of Ethical Considerations:&#xD;
&#xD;
                The Research Ethics Committee of Faculty of Medicine, Assiut&#xD;
&#xD;
                University approved the study protocol. Pregnant women who would&#xD;
&#xD;
                undergo elective lower segment cesarean section at term ( â¥ 37 weeks)&#xD;
&#xD;
                with normal fetal heart tracing received written and verbal information&#xD;
&#xD;
                about the study and were asked to participate. Those who agreed signed&#xD;
&#xD;
                an informed consent form&#xD;
&#xD;
                Statistical Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
                Data entry and analysis were carried out using Statistical Package&#xD;
&#xD;
                of Social Sciences for windows (SPSS, Chicago, Illinois, USA) version 20&#xD;
&#xD;
                Quantitative variables were presented in terms of meanÂ± standard&#xD;
&#xD;
                deviation and qualitative variables were expressed as frequency and&#xD;
&#xD;
                percentage. Tests of significance (T-test and chi-square) were calculated&#xD;
&#xD;
                Significance level was set at P value &lt; 0.05.&#xD;
