    <textblock>
      This study is intended to determine if compression garments effectively reduce pain in the&#xD;
      treatment of tibial stress syndrome (TSS) in the military population. The study will include&#xD;
      diagnoses of shin splints, which is medically known as tibial stress syndrome and medial&#xD;
      tibial stress syndrome, and compare a treatment group using compression garments to a control&#xD;
      group using passive recovery. Both groups will engage in a progressive walk-to-run program.&#xD;
      The outcomes will be measured by comparison in pain scales pre and post treatments. The&#xD;
      ability to perform a two mile run without pain symptoms will be assessed at the conclusion of&#xD;
      the study by participant's self-reported evaluation. The TSS screening questionnaire will be&#xD;
      obtained at each medical encounter to include the initial visit and follow-up visits at the&#xD;
      four and eight week (+/- 3 days) marks. The self-reported 2-mile run evaluation is included&#xD;
      on the TSSS questionnaire.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study objective is to determine whether use of compression garments in the treatment of&#xD;
      tibial stress syndrome will reduce pain compared with passive recovery alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific aims include evaluation of Visual Analog Scale (VAS) when utilizing compression&#xD;
      garments and passive recovery and a self-reported pain free running assessment by the&#xD;
      participant. VAS evaluation will occur at initial encounter, four weeks from treatment&#xD;
      initiation, and then again at eight weeks from treatment start. The follow up time frames&#xD;
      will have a ± three days to allow flexibility of the participant to follow up. The study will&#xD;
      be assessed with a 60 day evaluation period to coincide with previous study time periods as&#xD;
      well as the ability to lessen the possibility of participants lost to follow up that may be&#xD;
      relocated due to military orders. Assessment of functionality, symptomatic criteria, and&#xD;
      determination if further care is required will occur at each visit. A self-reported pain free&#xD;
      running assessment will be collected via questionnaire at the conclusion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators intend to prove that compression garments will better reduce pain symptoms&#xD;
      in the treatment of tibial stress syndrome (shin splints) compared with passive recovery&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct a prospective randomized control trial with the objective of determining if the&#xD;
      application of compression garments for the symptomatic treatment of tibial stress syndrome&#xD;
      produces improved rates of pain relief and activity tolerance compared to the control of&#xD;
      passive recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject population will be gathered from Fort Sam Houston McWethy TMC patients who consist of&#xD;
      active duty trainees for all military branches of service. Male and female participants from&#xD;
      18-45 years of age presenting with leg pain consistent with tibial stress syndrome will be&#xD;
      considered for this study. Age limitation is based on assumed increase in potential&#xD;
      confounders related to previous injury or pre-existing musculoskeletal conditions.&#xD;
      Approximately 42 participants are required based on comparison with previous studies. This&#xD;
      includes a 20 percent addition to account for participants lost to follow-up. Control group&#xD;
      will be treated with passive recovery only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADHOC report on international classification of diseases tenth revision, clinical&#xD;
      modification (ICD10) will be obtained for local comparisons of lower extremity diagnoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inclusion criteria consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients of the McWethy TMC&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to provide informed consent (of sound mind)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Acute or acute on chronic musculoskeletal pain of lower extremity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  18-45 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active duty military trainees of all service branches assigned to unit on Ft Sam Houston&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain at presentation indicated on Visual Analog Scale (VAS). All scores indicated on the&#xD;
           VAS will be accepted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exclusion criteria consist of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients outside of the McWethy TMC or not assigned to a unit on Ft Sam Houston&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient with lower extremity pain not consistent with tibial stress syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants with open wounds of the lower extremity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Temperature greater than 38˚ Celsius (100.4 Fahrenheit)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain associated with current diseases (neurologic/rheumatologic/cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Active infection at injury location&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients younger than 18 or older than 45 years of age&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research will be a prospective, randomized control trial. Subjects will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned to one of two conditions: use of compression garments (CG) in the treatment group or&#xD;
      passive recovery in the control group. Subjects will be randomized to either the treatment or&#xD;
      the control group through use of an envelope with separate cards indicating either &quot;relative&#xD;
      rest&quot; or &quot;compression garment&quot; on each individual card within the envelope. The envelope will&#xD;
      be maintained by the PI and/or AI associated with this study. The card within the envelope&#xD;
      will be selected by the study participant at the initial visit after the physical examination&#xD;
      has been completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Active duty Service members in training status arriving to the McWethy TMC with acute or&#xD;
      acute on chronic shin pain as a chief complaint will be considered for the study. Only those&#xD;
      meeting the inclusion criteria will be invited to take part in this study. Participants&#xD;
      enrolled in the study will be randomized to either control (n=21) or CG (n=21) groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be placed on a no run or walk profile for 60 days with the caveat of&#xD;
      gradual return to run expected. The graduated walk-to-run progression program will be in&#xD;
      accordance with Lackland Air Force Base Physical Therapy protocols. Subjects randomized to&#xD;
      the passive recovery (control) group will follow two weeks of total lower extremity rest,&#xD;
      excluding normal daily activities, while gradually integrating impact activity tolerance to&#xD;
      running over the remaining six weeks of the study. Subjects randomized to the CG group will&#xD;
      be measured for orthotics in accordance with manufacturer's recommendations and instructed on&#xD;
      the proper wear and use during their initial visit with the provider. CG will be worn at rest&#xD;
      for the initial two weeks following the initial encounter and then with activity between&#xD;
      weeks two and eight ± three days. CG may be used unilaterally or bilaterally depending on the&#xD;
      chief complaint of the subject. The subject will be instructed to continue wear of the CG for&#xD;
      the duration of the recommended treatment timeline unless an individual's pain scale of 0 has&#xD;
      been achieved and maintained throughout the study time period. The participant will continue&#xD;
      wear of the compression garment throughout the day for the first two weeks and then with&#xD;
      activity for the next six weeks. If the participant develops any worsening of lower extremity&#xD;
      symptoms they will be advised to discontinue use and follow up with their primary care&#xD;
      provider. This data will be included into the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject who consents to participate in the current study will complete a study-specific&#xD;
      questionnaire to obtain demographic information such as gender, age, and branch of service.&#xD;
      Demographic information will be collected for follow-up access and ensure contact with each&#xD;
      participating member is included. This information will be used for the purpose of follow-up&#xD;
      or research contact only. No PHI will be included in the data analysis or into research&#xD;
      documentation for any other purpose and will not be included in the final documentation or&#xD;
      research findings annotation. Additionally, information regarding number of days per week&#xD;
      each subject runs will be collected. Specifics on their perceived shin pain will be&#xD;
      ascertained that incorporates location, pain with ambulation, pain with running, pain with&#xD;
      sports activity, unilateral or bilateral symptom complaints, and pain at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, provider questioning and physical exam will include appearance of foot arch at&#xD;
      standing, roll of foot with ambulation, tenderness on palpation, pain with provocative tests,&#xD;
      pertinent historical evidence, range of motion, and body mass index. The diagnosis of tibial&#xD;
      stress syndrome will rely on clinical examination only. The diagnosis of medial tibial stress&#xD;
      syndrome has been condensed to tibial stress syndrome to ensure that a broader range of&#xD;
      tibial pain is included. Two common sites of exercise-induced tibial pain have been&#xD;
      described, posteromedial and more proximally anterolateral which reflects the posterior and&#xD;
      anterior tibial compartments, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CG in the treatment of TSS pain is likely to be a simple intervention that utilizes a&#xD;
      patient-centered strategy to elicit both short-term and long-term therapeutic benefits.&#xD;
      Knowledge of the range, individuality, and varied temporal patterns of treatment outcomes can&#xD;
      guide potential patients, clinicians, health care providers, and researchers. An informed&#xD;
      characterization of the treatment process in any intervention is needed to support&#xD;
      appropriate care and optimal results. Performing a nested qualitative study within the&#xD;
      pragmatic clinical trial will provide depth and meaning to the health-related outcome&#xD;
      measures. Each participant will be screened using a satisfaction questionnaire after the&#xD;
      treatment phase to obtain an account of his or her receiving the specific treatment related&#xD;
      to shin splint pain in the McWethy TMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure will be determined by using the visual analog scale (VAS) at rest&#xD;
      and compared to with impact activities such as running. VAS is a unidimensional pain&#xD;
      intensity scale; a 10-cm (100-mm) line on which the subject is asked to place a mark that&#xD;
      corresponds with his or her current pain intensity. The secondary outcomes are, pain&#xD;
      time-response after treatment, performance using subjective activity data collection, and&#xD;
      satisfaction using a binomial (yes/no), and the need for further evaluation after study&#xD;
      completion, which will be obtained during follow up at the four week timeframe or via phone&#xD;
      follow-up if member is unable to schedule a face to face visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome measure (pain level, assessed using the VAS) will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, four weeks (+/- 3 days), and eight weeks (+/- 3 days) after the initial encounter.&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes (time-response, performance and functionality, satisfaction) will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline, four weeks post initial encounter (+/- 3 days), and eight weeks (+/- 3&#xD;
      days) post initial encounter. Additional data collected, such as pain at rest and with&#xD;
      activity, and physical examination findings will be obtained during the medical visits and&#xD;
      used into data collection.&#xD;
