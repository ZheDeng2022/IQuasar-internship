  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this project the investigators will create computer reminders through user-centered design&#xD;
      and will validate the logic using retrospective electronic health record (EHR) data. Then the&#xD;
      investigators will test the reminders in primary care clinics to see if they improve&#xD;
      treatment of high blood pressure in early chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: The mean systolic blood pressure of the chronic kidney disease (CKD) population&#xD;
      can be decreased by an intervention with three innovative features: 1) methods to synthesize&#xD;
      EHR data in order to identify under-diagnosed chronic conditions, 2) iterative improvement in&#xD;
      clinical decision support (CDS) content through human factors methods to maximize the&#xD;
      &quot;informativeness&quot; of the CDS, and 3) the use of behavioral economic principles to create&#xD;
      behavioral &quot;nudges&quot; internal and external to the CDS.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To develop and validate the intervention. Specific Aim 1a: To develop and&#xD;
      validate the CDS that will: 1) synthesize existing laboratory tests, medication orders, and&#xD;
      vital sign data; 2) increase recognition of CKD, 3) increase recognition of uncontrolled HTN&#xD;
      in CKD patients; and 4) deliver evidence-based CKD and HTN management recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1b: To improve the design and content of the CDS, we will use human factors&#xD;
      methods, specifically usability testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1c: To develop a &quot;wrap-around&quot; intervention including two behavioral &quot;nudges&quot;:&#xD;
      1) pre-checked default orders, and 2) an email to obtain commitment from PCPs to obtain their&#xD;
      commitment to follow the CDS recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1a Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Develop Rules for Evidence-based Recommendations for HTN in CKD: The investigators will&#xD;
      leverage past work that they have done in a study that delivered recommendations based on&#xD;
      national guidelines. An example of one of the rules is to determine whether anti-hypertensive&#xD;
      agents have been prescribed but are not at highest potency. If so, the CDS will deliver a&#xD;
      recommendation to increase the dosage. The investigators will also include one-click access&#xD;
      to recommended orders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation: Before the start of the trial, the CDS will be moved to the Production&#xD;
      environment in &quot;silent mode&quot; where it will record when it would fire, but it will not be&#xD;
      displayed to the user. This step will allow us to validate that the rules are accurately&#xD;
      identifying patients and producing the correct recommendations through a chart review. The&#xD;
      CDS will be activated in the Production environment on the start date of the clinical trial&#xD;
      in Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1b Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usability Test Procedure: Usability testing clinical scenarios will be developed by subject&#xD;
      matter experts. Contextual inquiry sessions will be conducted with PCPs and the investigators&#xD;
      will ask for feedback on the usability test procedure, as well as content of test scenarios.&#xD;
      The goal of Aim 1b is to iteratively improve other important aspects of the CDS that&#xD;
      contribute to the overall informativeness of the CDS. The investigators will conduct two&#xD;
      rounds of usability testing with PCPs. After each test, the research team and Epic build&#xD;
      specialist will make iterative changes to the content of the CDS and layout of information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative analysis: Qualitative methods will be employed to analyze the data. The&#xD;
      transcripts will be organized by task and participant and then quotes will be identified that&#xD;
      illustrate a user expectation, frustration, or misinterpretation of content or functionality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1c Study Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Pre-checked, no-action default: The first nudge will be part of the CDS. The&#xD;
           investigators will display the CDS with certain options pre-selected.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pledge email to obtain commitment from PCPs to follow the CDS recommendations: As a&#xD;
           starting point, we need to ensure that PCPs are aware of the clinical practice&#xD;
           guidelines. At the beginning of the study, we will send an advertisement email to all&#xD;
           PCPs in the network. In addition, as part of the intervention, we will ask intervention&#xD;
           arm PCPs to commit to following the recommendations presented to them in the BPA, or&#xD;
           writing their rationale in the CDS if they choose not to. By clicking a link in an&#xD;
           email, the intervention PCP will come to a REDCap survey asking them to type their name&#xD;
           to pledge to consider the CDS recommendations provided in our BPAs. The control PCPs&#xD;
           will receive a control email without the specific details about the study and without&#xD;
           the REDCap link.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To test the effectiveness of the intervention. Specific Aim 2a: To evaluate&#xD;
      whether the intervention developed in Aim 1 significantly decreases mean systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure in a population of CKD patients with blood pressure &gt; 140/90. They will evaluate the&#xD;
      effectiveness of the intervention in a pragmatic, cluster-randomized controlled trial,&#xD;
      randomized at the level of the physician. Secondary outcomes will include&#xD;
      hypertension-specific process measures, such as treatment intensification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2b: To evaluate whether the intervention improves process measures for quality&#xD;
      of CKD care including: annual serum creatinine test, and annual urine albumin test.&#xD;
