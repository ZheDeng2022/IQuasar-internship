    <textblock>
      The objective of this pilot study is (i) to test the use of an Artificial Pancreas (AP)&#xD;
      System as a viable therapy treatment for two vulnerable populations: 6 to 10 year-old and&#xD;
      adults older â‰¥65 years old with T1D; (ii) to assess cognitive function in children and older&#xD;
      adult patients with T1D and examine whether improved glycemic control defined by stable (more&#xD;
      than 70% of the day in glycemic range 70-180 mg/dL) control positively influences cognitive&#xD;
      function; and (iii) obtain preliminary data to apply to funds to continue with larger and&#xD;
      longer clinical trials.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate up to 15 subjects in each age group for a period of 8-10 weeks&#xD;
      performing neurocognitive tests before and after each intervention. The first study phase&#xD;
      will be up to 2 weeks of a training period to allow participants to get acquainted with the&#xD;
      use of the CGM if they are not familiar with the use of the device. This training period will&#xD;
      be followed by a 4-week sensor-augmented pump (SAP) period using a study CGM and the&#xD;
      subject's personal insulin pump. The subjects will return to clinic at the completion of the&#xD;
      SAP period and will be trained on the Tandem t:slim X2 with Control-IQ and G6 CGM. At the&#xD;
      completion of the system training session, subjects will begin 4-weeks of Closed-Loop Control&#xD;
      (CLC). Questionnaires will be completed by the study subject at screening, after completion&#xD;
      of SAP and after completion of CLC. Ecological Momentary Assessments (EMAs) and actigraphy&#xD;
      data will be collected in the last 14 days of the SAP and CLC periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A parent/guardian of the enrolled children will also be asked to participate in all&#xD;
      trainings, complete parental Patient-Report Outcomes (PRO) Questionnaires, and collect sleep&#xD;
      patterns while wearing the actigraph watch.&#xD;

          <description>Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI): a 10-item questionnaire assessment of sleep quality disturbances over the last month. Individual Items are rated on a 4 point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 3, which are then used to calculate a Global Score which can range from 0 to 21 with higher scores reflecting worse sleep quality. Parents completed the questionnaire for the young children cohort.</description>
