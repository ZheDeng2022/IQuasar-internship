    <textblock>
      This study is for patients with metastatic prostate cancer receiving radium-223 as their&#xD;
      standard of care therapy. The researchers will collect blood and urine samples from patients&#xD;
      before, during and after the radium-223 therapy. The researchers will compare these samples&#xD;
      to observe how the treatment has affected different cancer markers.&#xD;

      This study proposes to document the presence of clonal emergence and regression during&#xD;
      radium-223 therapy for metastatic prostate cancer by serial ctDNA analysis of&#xD;
      tumor-associated mutations, using the clinically-available Guardant 360 platform. These data&#xD;
      may provide important mechanistic insights into radium-223 therapy by 1) identifying&#xD;
      mutations associated with radium-223 resistance or sensitivity, 2) providing new markers of&#xD;
      treatment response in an individual, and 3) revealing antitumor effects from radium-223 that&#xD;
      are not easily recognized with standard tumor response metrics. Positive finding based on&#xD;
      this clinically-available platform will be readily applied by the oncology treatment&#xD;
      community.&#xD;
