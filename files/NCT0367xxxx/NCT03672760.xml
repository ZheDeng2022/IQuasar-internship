    <textblock>
      Existing data points to relevant beneficial effects of respiratory exercises on&#xD;
      cardiovascular health, with special regards to decreases on arterial pressure and improves on&#xD;
      autonomic and vascular profiles, though mechanistics of such results have not yet been&#xD;
      cleared. Among the available ways to perform respiratory exercises, there is the highly&#xD;
      recommended Inspiratory Muscle Training (IMT) and slow breathing exercises like Yoga&#xD;
      pranayamas. Lately, the development of new technologies has allowed the use of Apps to&#xD;
      perform respiratory exercises. This study will be take the just developed CardioBreath®App to&#xD;
      validate it as a tool to perform respiratory exercises. Therefore, it will be compared to IMT&#xD;
      on cardiac vagal modulation and pulse wave velocity on normotensive post menopause women.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Menopause years represent an increasing risk for hypertension and autonomic nervous system&#xD;
      (ANS), endothelial and vascular imbalance. Existing data point to beneficial effects of&#xD;
      respiratory exercises either on ANS and light on therapeutic relevance of these kind of&#xD;
      exercises on prevention and treatment of cardiovascular and pulmonary diseases. However, few&#xD;
      data is available about the effects of respiratory exercises on both vascular and endothelial&#xD;
      function, and its possible interactions with ANS. Besides that, recommendations of slower&#xD;
      respiratory rates are associated to healthier physical and psychological states. Among&#xD;
      available techniques to perform breathing exercises, most referenced are Inspiratory Muscle&#xD;
      Training (IMT) and Yoga based slow breathing (pranayamas). New technologies have allowed the&#xD;
      development of Apps which aim to ease the possibilities of exercising breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMT uses a mouth device for pressure adjustment and presents a variety e training forms&#xD;
      including combinations of intensity and volume through loads adjustment. It aims the&#xD;
      enhancement of respiratory muscles strength and endurance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CardioBreath®App has been developed by experienced physical education and yoga professional&#xD;
      based on individual prescription of respiratory rates to workout through voice and image&#xD;
      guidance of both posture and breathing technique. The performance might be followed through a&#xD;
      progression map. It´s available in portuguese language for Android and Ios, has been&#xD;
      submitted to Brazilian Trend Marks Institute (INPI) which has not shown opposition to the&#xD;
      registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It´s a randomized clinical trial recruiting normotensive post menopause women. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will be assessed by Finometer for blood pressure and heart rate variability as&#xD;
      measures for autonomic outcomes. Data analysis of these data will be processed by&#xD;
      CardioSeries software through Fourier fast transform (FFT) in order to generate vagal and&#xD;
      sympathetic values. For pulse wave velocity and central arterial pressure the participants&#xD;
      will be assessed by Complior Analyser. Endothelial function will be evaluated through&#xD;
      ultrasonography of brachial artery (Flow Mediated Dilation - FMD-) at baseline and after 5&#xD;
      minutes reactive hyperemia with a cuffing installed in forearm at 200 mm Hg for 5 minutes.&#xD;
      Images will be recorded and Cardiovascular Suite software will be used for analysis of flow&#xD;
      and dilation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be randomized into 3 intervention groups as follows: IMT, IMT placebo&#xD;
      and CardioBreath®App. The intervention will long five weeks. The exercises will be performed&#xD;
      at home for five days/ week during 10 minutes and will be registered by audio for whatsapp&#xD;
      (IMT) and &quot;Progress&quot; graphics (CardioBreath®App) Once a week they will visit the laboratory&#xD;
      set to adjust loads (IMT) and respiratory rates in CardioBreath®App groups, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After five weeks the participants will be re-evaluated for all outcomes described above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis will be provided by ANOVA of two repeated measures and Bonferroni post hoc. All&#xD;
      data will be presented in mean +- standard deviation.&#xD;
