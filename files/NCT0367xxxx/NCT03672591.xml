    <textblock>
      Impaired renal function and heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) are two&#xD;
      often co-existing medical conditions and are known to be associated with adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcome and increased mortality. The relationship between HFpEF and renal&#xD;
      impairment is bidirectional. On the one hand, renal dysfunction has been shown to be an&#xD;
      independent risk factor for the development of HFpEF. On the other hand, an increase in&#xD;
      central venous pressure leading to renal dysfunction by a reduction of renal blood flow (RBF)&#xD;
      and perfusion pressure (RPP) as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
      system (RAAS) in patients with HFpEF has been previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the literature, several studies aimed to investigate the association between renal (dys-)&#xD;
      function and HFpEF. In all these studies, renal function was assessed by determination of&#xD;
      standard kidney function parameters such as serum creatinine, eGFR and urinary albumin to&#xD;
      creatinine ratio (UACR). Constant infusion input clearance technique however offers a more&#xD;
      detailed evaluation of renal function and hemodynamics. To the best of knowledge, renal&#xD;
      hemodynamics in patients with HFpEF have not yet been investigated by clearance technique.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of the present study is to evaluate renal function and hemodynamics by&#xD;
      means of constant infusion input clearance technique with sodium p-aminohippuric acid (PAH)&#xD;
      and Iohexol in 40 patients with HFpEF. The constant infusion input clearance technique offers&#xD;
      an exact evaluation of renal function by measuring (not estimating) glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rate and renal hemodynamic parameters such as renal plasma flow (RPF), filtration fraction&#xD;
      (FF) and intraglomerular pressure (IGP). These results will be compared to 140 subjects&#xD;
      without HFpEF that have participated in various studies and have been analyzed with the same&#xD;
      constant infusion input clearance technique performed in the Clinical Research Center of the&#xD;
      University Hospital Erlangen-Nuremberg. Additionally, flow mediated vasodilation (FMD), pulse&#xD;
      wave velocity and parameters of retinal vascular remodeling by means of scanning laser&#xD;
      Doppler flowmetry (SLDF) will be assessed in patients with HFpEF thereby allowing to examine&#xD;
      the relationship between vascular remodeling in the systemic and renal circulation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Several studies evaluating the outcome among patients with HFpEF revealed that this entity of&#xD;
      heart failure (HF) is associated with high mortality rates and some studies even indicate&#xD;
      that mortality is similar to patients with heart failure and reduced ejection fraction&#xD;
      (HFrEF). Hospitalization for HFpEF is increasing relative to HFrEF, highlighting the need for&#xD;
      a better understanding of the pathogenetic processes in order to develop new treatment&#xD;
      strategies for this type of HF. Recently, the PARAMOUNT study revealed that in patients with&#xD;
      HFpEF, treatment with the dual-acting angiotensin receptor neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI) LCZ696&#xD;
      was associated with lower levels of creatinine and higher estimated glomerular filtration&#xD;
      rates (eGFR) indicating a better preservation of renal function in comparison to treatment&#xD;
      with valsartan only. Another observation of this study was an increase in urinary albumin to&#xD;
      creatinine ratio (UACR) in the group of LCZ696-treatment, which was not visible in patients&#xD;
      randomized to the valsartan group. Additionally, analysis of the relation between albuminuria&#xD;
      and/or decreased eGFR and cardiovascular function and structure revealed that renal&#xD;
      dysfunction was common in this group of patients and associated with cardiac remodeling and&#xD;
      dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to two thirds of patients with HFpEF are suffering from chronic kidney disease (CKD). A&#xD;
      bidirectional cardiorenal relation has been recently described and is known to be associated&#xD;
      with adverse cardiovascular outcome and increased mortality. On the one hand, renal&#xD;
      dysfunction has been shown to be an independent risk factor for the development of HFpEF due&#xD;
      to inflammatory processes and endothelial dysfunction. On the other hand, an increase in&#xD;
      central venous pressure leading to renal dysfunction by a reduction of renal blood flow (RBF)&#xD;
      and perfusion pressure (RPP) as well as activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone&#xD;
      system (RAAS) in patients with HFpEF has been previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This association has also been demonstrated for patients with HFrEF. However, several studies&#xD;
      comparing patients with the two subtypes of HF in the context of CKD indicate that this&#xD;
      association is more pronounced in patients with HFpEF. For example, a community-based cohort&#xD;
      study by Brouwers et al. including 8592 subjects of the PREVEND trial showed that renal&#xD;
      function parameters such as urinary albumin excretion (UAE) and cystatin C were associated&#xD;
      with a high risk for the development of HFpEF but not HFrEF. Ahmed et al. even reported a&#xD;
      higher CKD-related mortality in HFpEF than in HFrEF patients with an underlying&#xD;
      graded-response relation as CKD-associated mortality increased with higher left ventricular&#xD;
      ejection fraction (LVEF). These findings suggest different pathogenetic processes for these&#xD;
      two subtypes of HF. Therefore, detailed exploration of the pathophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      behind the relationship of HFpEF and renal function represents a matter of major research&#xD;
      interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several studies aimed to investigate the association between renal (dys-) function&#xD;
      and HFpEF. Unger et al. retrospectively examined the relationship between renal function and&#xD;
      echocardiographic parameters in 299 patients with HFpEF. The analysis revealed that CKD was&#xD;
      independently associated with worse cardiac mechanics and outcomes in this population.9&#xD;
      Studying 217 participants from the PARAMOUNT trial with HFpEF, Gori et al. demonstrated that&#xD;
      renal dysfunction was associated with abnormal left ventricular geometry, lower midwall&#xD;
      fractional shortening and higher NT-proBNP. In both studies, renal function was assessed with&#xD;
      commonly used tests such as determination of serum creatinine, eGFR and urinary albumin to&#xD;
      creatinine ratio (UACR). However, these parameters only allow an approximate estimation of&#xD;
      renal function. Constant infusion input clearance technique offers a more complete approach&#xD;
      towards evaluation of renal function and perfusion, allowing an exact quantification of&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and renal hemodynamic parameters such as renal plasma flow&#xD;
      (RPF), filtration fraction (FF) and intraglomerular hemodynamics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of HFpEF in literature is rather inconsistent. In some studies, HFpEF was&#xD;
      defined by an ejection fraction of ≥ 45%, whereas other authors used a cut-off value of 50%.&#xD;
      In the present study, the categorization of heart failure as HFpEF will follow the 2016&#xD;
      European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines for the diagnosis and treatment of acute and&#xD;
      chronic heart failure applying a cut-off value of 50%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the present study is to evaluate renal function and hemodynamics by means of&#xD;
      constant infusion input clearance technique with PAH and Iohexol in 40 patients with HFpEF&#xD;
      with the aim to better characterize the relationship between renal dysfunction and HFpEF.&#xD;
      These results will be compared to 140 subjects without HFpEF who participated in different&#xD;
      studies during which renal clearance examination has been performed with the constant&#xD;
      infusion input clearance technique in the Clinical Research Center of the University Hospital&#xD;
      Erlangen-Nuremberg. In parallel, pulse wave velocity, flow mediated vasodilation and other&#xD;
      vascular parameters, reflecting the vascular wall properties of small and large arteries,&#xD;
      will be assessed. Additionally, there will be a non-invasive retinal examination to assess&#xD;
      vascular remodeling of retinal arterioles (wall to lumen ratio, WLR), retinal capillary flow&#xD;
      (RCF) and capillary rarefaction.&#xD;
