  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Introduction: Sarcomas are rare tumors of connective tissue. The exact overall incidence of&#xD;
      sarcomas is unknown due to diagnostic difficulties and the various histological subtypes&#xD;
      (over 80 subtypes). However, the apparent increasing incidence of sarcomas suggests&#xD;
      environmental causes such as pesticides. Except for some specific factors (i.e. ionizing&#xD;
      radiation, vinyl chloride, dioxin, and genetic predispositions) the scientific knowledge on&#xD;
      the aetiology of sarcomas is sparse and inconsistent. France is a particularly appropriate&#xD;
      country to set up a study investigating the causes of sarcoma occurrence due to the French&#xD;
      organization in treatment and care of sarcoma patients, which is highly structured and&#xD;
      revolved around national expert networks. The main objective of the ETIOSARC project is to&#xD;
      study the role of lifestyle, environmental and occupational factors in the occurrence of&#xD;
      sarcomas among adults from a multicentric population-based case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods and analysis: Cases will be all incident cases (older than 18 years old) identified&#xD;
      in 15 districts of France covered by a cancer registry and/or a reference center in sarcoma's&#xD;
      patient care over a three-year period with an inclusion start date ranging from the 1st&#xD;
      October 2018 to the 1st January 2020 and histologically confirmed by a second review of the&#xD;
      diagnosis. Two controls will be individually-matched by sex, age (5-years group), and&#xD;
      districts of residence and randomly selected from electoral list. A standardized&#xD;
      questionnaire will be administered by a trained interviewer in order to gather information&#xD;
      about occupational and residential history, demographic and socioeconomic characteristics and&#xD;
      lifestyle factors. At the end of the interview, a saliva sample will be systematically&#xD;
      proposed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will permit to validate or not already suspected risk factors for sarcomas such as&#xD;
      phenoxyherbicides, chlorophenol and to generate new hypothesis to increase our understanding&#xD;
      about the genetic and environmental contributions in the carcinogenicity process.&#xD;

      The main objective of the ETIOSARC study is to assess the role of lifestyle, environmental&#xD;
      and occupational factors in the occurrence of sarcomas among adults from a multicenter&#xD;
      population-based case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To identify environmental risk factors for sarcomas as a whole and for the most frequent&#xD;
           subtypes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To investigate the interactions between gene polymorphisms and environmental exposures&#xD;
           in sarcoma susceptibility;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess whether some specific genetic characteristics of sarcoma' tumors are&#xD;
           associated with environmental exposures; We will also explore the feasibility of&#xD;
           classifying sarcomas by genetics types (simple vs complex genomic profile) as part of&#xD;
           the objective of identifying environmental risk factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ETIOSARC study is a prospective multicenter population-based case-control study. This&#xD;
      study is restricted to French geographical areas (further called districts) that meet at&#xD;
      least one of these four criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criteria 1: Districts covered by both a general cancer registry and a French Sarcoma&#xD;
           Group (GSF-GETO) expert center from either the network of reference for soft-tissue&#xD;
           sarcoma pathology (RRePS), the network of reference for bone sarcoma pathology (ResOs)&#xD;
           or the clinical sarcoma network (NetSarc);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criteria 2: Districts including a coordinator center of any of the RRePS / NetSarc&#xD;
           networks;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criteria 3: Districts covered by a general cancer registry that is expected to register&#xD;
           more than 50 cases per year;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Criteria 4: Districts adjacent to districts meeting criteria 1 and covered by a general&#xD;
           cancer registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total, 15 districts meet one of the four criteria, which represent approximatively 24% of&#xD;
      the French population (2015 estimations from the national institute of statistics and&#xD;
      economic studies, Insee). Nine districts meet criteria 1 (Gironde, Hérault, Haute-Vienne,&#xD;
      Loire Atlantique, Calvados, Nord, Bas-Rhin and Doubs, Poitou-Charentes), two districts meet&#xD;
      criteria 2 (Rhône and Val-de-Marne); two districts meet criteria 3 (Isère and Haut-Rhin) et&#xD;
      two districts meet criteria 4 (Manche, Vendée).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cases recruitment modalities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited by specifically trained clinical research associate (CRA). In&#xD;
      districts where a general cancer registry is active, the process of identifying incident&#xD;
      sarcoma patients is well defined, which warrants the efficiency and exhaustiveness of the&#xD;
      recruitment. However, poor survival for some cancer cases will not allow to rely on routine&#xD;
      inclusion procedure and the registries will implement a rapid case ascertainment procedure to&#xD;
      minimize the delay between diagnosis and enrollment and interview. Cases will be identified&#xD;
      from pathology laboratories and multidisciplinary sarcoma tumor board (including sarcoma,&#xD;
      gynecological, digestive, skin and bone tumor board). CRA will regularly contact laboratories&#xD;
      and hospitals (within a three months window) to identify newly diagnosed sarcoma cases and to&#xD;
      collect associated reports. The CRA will retrieve the clinical file in order to check&#xD;
      inclusion and non inclusion criteria and to collect names and addresses of eligible patients&#xD;
      and their physicians. Then, the CRA will contact the case's physicians in order to gather&#xD;
      their clinical advice to include their patients in the study. In case of agreement, the CRA&#xD;
      will contact the patients and ask them to participate. In case of oral agreement, he/she will&#xD;
      arrange an interview to collect written consent and administer detailed questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Rhône and Val de Marne where no general cancer registry exists, the process of identifying&#xD;
      incident sarcoma patients will largely rely on the existence of a RRePS/ResOS/NetSarc&#xD;
      coordination center to facilitate the identification of new cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regardless of the district, the diagnosis of all included cases will be systematically&#xD;
      ascertained by an expert pathologist within the RRePS and ResOs networks following a standard&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On a regular basis (at least once a month), the list of incident cases included in the&#xD;
      RRePS/ResOS/NetSarc networks will be extracted from the shared databases. The list of cases&#xD;
      identified by registries will be merged with the list of cases included in the&#xD;
      RRePS/ResOS/NetSarc networks by the pathology sample reference number in order to collect&#xD;
      diagnosis confirmation and to identify new but missed incident cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controls selection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The selection of controls and the recruitment of cases will take place simultaneously. Every&#xD;
      time a case will be diagnosed and identified, two controls will be randomly selected at that&#xD;
      time from the electoral rolls of the same district as the case district of residence. For&#xD;
      each case, a list of 20 potential controls with the same age (within a 5-year age group) and&#xD;
      sex as the cases will be constituted in order to account for potential refusal. Calls to&#xD;
      contact potential controls will be centralized and will be made by an investigator&#xD;
      specifically trained to better understand the objectives of the study. First, this&#xD;
      investigator will try to retrieve the phone number of the first potential control on the list&#xD;
      and will contact him/her in order to gather his/her agreement to participate in this study.&#xD;
      After five calls made at different schedules (e.g. in the evening on weekdays), if the&#xD;
      potential control couldn't be reached, the investigator will send an information letter&#xD;
      containing a reply coupon indicating phone number and schedule at which the person could be&#xD;
      reach. If the reply coupon is not returned, or after 10 calls made at the phone number and&#xD;
      the schedule indicated on the reply coupon, the first potential control will be considered as&#xD;
      unreachable and then, the same procedure will be applied for the second potential controls on&#xD;
      the list and so on until two controls per case agreed to participate to the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each control agreeing to participate, an appointment will be made to collect written&#xD;
      consent and to administer detailed questionnaire by a CRA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will give their informed written consent to participation, in line with&#xD;
      French ethical guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from self-questionnaire supplemented by a specific questionnaire. The&#xD;
      self-questionnaire will permit to gather the complete occupational history (for each job held&#xD;
      for at least 6 months) and residential history (for each place occupied for at least 6&#xD;
      months). During a face-to-face interview, the trained interviewer will check (complete if&#xD;
      necessary) and supplement the self-administered questionnaire by a specific questionnaire&#xD;
      with questions about demographic and socioeconomic characteristics, occupations of spouse and&#xD;
      parents, leisure-time activities, reproduction, medical history, family history of cancer,&#xD;
      diet, lifestyle factors such as tobacco smoking and alcohol consumption. The specific&#xD;
      questionnaire will also collect additional occupational and residential information such as&#xD;
      work tasks, work places, materials handled for each job held for at least 6 months and&#xD;
      description of the environment of each residence places.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the interview, subjects (both cases and controls) will be invited to provide a&#xD;
      saliva sample in order to obtain germline DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In case of refusal to participate and if the subject agreed, data on demographic and&#xD;
      socioeconomic characteristics will be collected in order to assess the potential selection&#xD;
      bias that might occur due to the specific profile of non-respondent subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biological sampling and storage&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant will be asked to provide a salivary sample in order to obtain germline DNA.&#xD;
      Salivary samples will be collected by the subjects themselves under instructions from the&#xD;
      CRA, using DNA Genotek Oragene 575 collection kit. After collection, samples will be sent at&#xD;
      the Biological Resources Center of the Bordeaux hospital university center &quot;Bordeaux&#xD;
      Biothèque Santé&quot; for storage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Determination of the sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since our definition of environmental exposures is very broad, the sample size calculation&#xD;
      has been based on various scenarios of exposure prevalence, from 5% (relevant for domestic,&#xD;
      environmental but also some occupational exposures such as farmer in the general population)&#xD;
      to 20% (relevant for some occupational exposures such as fibers). For a total sample size of&#xD;
      2000 cases and a 1:2 individually-matched design, considering a statistical power of 80% at a&#xD;
      significance level of 5%, the minimum detectable odds ratio will be 1.39 and 1.21 under a&#xD;
      exposure prevalence of 5% and 20%, respectively. Considering sub-types analyses, the four&#xD;
      main histological types are GIST, liposarcoma, leiomyosarcoma and unclassified sarcoma, which&#xD;
      account for 18%, 15%, 11% and 16% of sarcomas, respectively. Considering a sample size of 300&#xD;
      cases, the minimum detectable odds ratio will be 2.21 and 1.61 under an exposure prevalence&#xD;
      of 5% and 20%, respectively. Typically in environmental epidemiology, the relative increases&#xD;
      in disease risks due to environmental exposures are usually low around 1.5, thus, it is&#xD;
      essential to recruit a minimum of 2000 cases in order to be able to perform sub-type&#xD;
      analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relationship between case/control status and each exposure variable and 95% confidence&#xD;
      intervals will be individually estimated using conditional logistic regression models. If&#xD;
      necessary, a multilevel logistic model will be implemented in order to take into account the&#xD;
      data variability due to the multicenter design and the various CRA that will administer the&#xD;
      questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratified histological sub-types analyses are also planned. Moreover, since sarcomas may be&#xD;
      classified into four groups on a molecular basis (i.e. sarcomas with recurrent translocation,&#xD;
      sarcomas with specific activating or inactivating mutations, sarcomas with MDM2&#xD;
      amplifications, and sarcomas with a complex genomic profile), the feasibility of classifying&#xD;
      sarcomas by genetic types instead of by histological subtypes for the objective of&#xD;
      identifying environmental risk factors will be explore. The underlying hypothesis is that the&#xD;
      aetiology among these four molecular groups may be homogeneous.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods for coordinating the project and for quality control&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is organized around three different centers or committees: a national coordination&#xD;
      center, a steering committee, and local centers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national coordination center will be in charge of running routine operations, assisting&#xD;
      participating local centers, guaranteeing the quality of the data collection, centralizing&#xD;
      data, supervising the data coding and exposure assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The steering committee's principal role will be to establish research priorities based on the&#xD;
      availability of the data and the current scientific knowledge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Local centers will be in charge of determining identification sources of cases in their&#xD;
      districts and of collecting data. They will also transmit the collected data to the national&#xD;
      coordination center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standardized procedures are written in a procedure manual to guarantee the quality of the&#xD;
      collected data. Besides, a completion guide of the standardized questionnaire has been&#xD;
      developed to assist CRA during interviews. A data manager will ensure that the study is&#xD;
      conducted in compliance with the protocol. On a regular basis and as frequently as necessary,&#xD;
      he/she will assess the quality of the collected data using several indicators: the average&#xD;
      time spent by the CRA at the subject's home, the degree of completeness of the questionnaires&#xD;
      by CRA, the ratio of included cases to expected cases, the average elapsed time between the&#xD;
      identification of a case and the interview, the average elapsed time between case and control&#xD;
      interviews, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All collected data will be centralized in a single location, the University of Bordeaux&#xD;
      (CREDIM, centre de Recherche et de Développement en Informatique Médicale).&#xD;
