  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single arm, multi-site pilot study aims to evaluate the feasibility of recruiting and&#xD;
      adherence to a 12 week home-based exercise intervention to be conducted in men with&#xD;
      metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) receiving androgen deprivation&#xD;
      therapy (ADT). Thirty patients will be enrolled, with the expectation that 20-25 will&#xD;
      complete all follow-up measures.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the feasibility and adherence to a home-based 12&#xD;
      week exercise intervention in mCRPC patients receiving ADT. It will also examine if a&#xD;
      home-based exercise intervention can improve muscle strength, body composition, physical&#xD;
      function, cardiopulmonary function fatigue, and patient reported outcomes (fatigue,&#xD;
      depression, quality of life (QoL)).&#xD;

    <description>The intervention consists of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour. The progressive aerobic exercise will involve walking that varies from from 15 to 30 minutes done 2-4 times per week at an intensity from 40% to 65% of heart rate reserve. Therabands elastic bands will be used to perform 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. Once a participant can comfortably complete 15 repetitions for all prescribed sets, they will increase resistance by moving up to the next band. The training volume increased from 1 set per exercise on week 1 to 3 sets by week 12.</description>

        <description>To estimate the feasibility of a 12 week, home-based exercise intervention in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCPRC) patients undergoing androgen deprivation therapy by reporting the percentage of patients who complete the pre/post testing following the intervention.&#xD;

            <description>The sole intervention group will complete a combination of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour.&#xD;
Home-based exercise: The intervention consists of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour. The progressive aerobic exercise will involve walking that varies from from 15 to 30 minutes done 2-4 times per week at an intensity from 40% to 65% of heart rate reserve. Therabands elastic bands will be used to perform 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. Once a participant can comfortably complete 15 repetitions for all prescribed sets, they will increase resistance by moving up to the next band. The training volume increased from 1 set per exercise on week 1 to 3 sets by week 12.</description>

            <description>The sole intervention group will complete a combination of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour.&#xD;
Home-based exercise: The intervention consists of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour. The progressive aerobic exercise will involve walking that varies from from 15 to 30 minutes done 2-4 times per week at an intensity from 40% to 65% of heart rate reserve. Therabands elastic bands will be used to perform 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. Once a participant can comfortably complete 15 repetitions for all prescribed sets, they will increase resistance by moving up to the next band. The training volume increased from 1 set per exercise on week 1 to 3 sets by week 12.</description>

All of the individual questions are scored from 0-4 with total scores ranging between 0 and 156 where a higher number represents higher QoL.</description>

Home-based exercise: The intervention consists of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour. The progressive aerobic exercise will involve walking that varies from from 15 to 30 minutes done 2-4 times per week at an intensity from 40% to 65% of heart rate reserve. Therabands elastic bands will be used to perform 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. Once a participant can comfortably complete 15 repetitions for all prescribed sets, they will increase resistance by moving up to the next band. The training volume increased from 1 set per exercise on week 1 to 3 sets by week 12.</description>

Home-based exercise: The intervention consists of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour. The progressive aerobic exercise will involve walking that varies from from 15 to 30 minutes done 2-4 times per week at an intensity from 40% to 65% of heart rate reserve. Therabands elastic bands will be used to perform 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. Once a participant can comfortably complete 15 repetitions for all prescribed sets, they will increase resistance by moving up to the next band. The training volume increased from 1 set per exercise on week 1 to 3 sets by week 12.</description>

Muscle endurance is the total number of repetitions completed using 70% of maximal load determined during muscle strength testing (outcome 12). Greater muscle endurance are associated with greater physical function and QoL.</description>

        <title>Cardiopulmonary Function</title>
        <description>To report changes in cardiopulmonary function following the intervention. Cardiopulmonary function (VO2 peak) will be assessed using a graded exercise test on a treadmill. Patients will begin the test walking slowly on the treadmill and every two minutes, the grade and speed of the treadmill will be increased in a progressive manner until fatigue occurs. Respiratory gases will be collected throughout the test and analyzed using a metabolic cart to determine oxygen utilization and carbon dioxide production. The maximal oxygen uptake that is recorded will be used as a marker of aerobic fitness.</description>

Home-based exercise: The intervention consists of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour. The progressive aerobic exercise will involve walking that varies from from 15 to 30 minutes done 2-4 times per week at an intensity from 40% to 65% of heart rate reserve. Therabands elastic bands will be used to perform 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. Once a participant can comfortably complete 15 repetitions for all prescribed sets, they will increase resistance by moving up to the next band. The training volume increased from 1 set per exercise on week 1 to 3 sets by week 12.</description>

          <description>The sole intervention group will complete a combination of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour.&#xD;
Home-based exercise: The intervention consists of aerobic and strength training ~3 times per week for 12 weeks with each session lasting 1 hour. The progressive aerobic exercise will involve walking that varies from from 15 to 30 minutes done 2-4 times per week at an intensity from 40% to 65% of heart rate reserve. Therabands elastic bands will be used to perform 12 to 15 repetitions per exercise. Once a participant can comfortably complete 15 repetitions for all prescribed sets, they will increase resistance by moving up to the next band. The training volume increased from 1 set per exercise on week 1 to 3 sets by week 12.</description>
