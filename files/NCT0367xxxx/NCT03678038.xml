      This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of hydrodilatation with steroid via&#xD;
      posterior approach versus rotator interval approach for treating patients with adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Adhesive capsulitis is a common cause of shoulder pain, and the efficacy of most&#xD;
      interventions is limited. This study was conducted to compare the efficacy of rotator&#xD;
      interval injection with steroid with that of steroid hydrodilatatoin for treating adhesive&#xD;
      capsulitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: a prospective, single-blinded, randomized, clinical trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with adhesive capsulitis were enrolled and randomly allocated into group 1 (&#xD;
      ultrasound guided rotator interval injection ) and group 2 (ultrasound guided steroid&#xD;
      hydrodilatation). The patients were evaluated before treatment and were reevaluated 0, 6, and&#xD;
      12 weeks after the beginning of the treatment. Outcomes measures included a pain scale&#xD;
      (visual analog scale), range of motion, Constant shoulder score, and Shoulder Pain And&#xD;
      Disability Index.&#xD;

    <description>The Shoulder Pain and Disability Index (SPADI) is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of two dimensions, one for pain and the other for functional activities. The pain dimension consists of five questions regarding the severity of an individual's pain. Functional activities are assessed with eight questions designed to measure the degree of difficulty an individual has with various activities of daily living that require upper-extremity use. The SPADI takes 5 to 10 minutes for a patient to complete and is the only reliable and valid region-specific measure for the shoulder.function. The score is divided into four sections: pain, activity of daily living, ROM and strength</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>pain intensity</measure>
    <time_frame>Change of the score between 6 weeks and baseline, and change of the score between 12 weeks and baseline</time_frame>
    <description>pain intensity was measured by visual analog scale. Each patient was asked to indicate his/her current level of pain by marking a point on a 100-mm VAS, for which 0 represented no pain and 100 represented unbearable pain.</description>
