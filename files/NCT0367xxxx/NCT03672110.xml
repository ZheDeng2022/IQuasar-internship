    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to demonstrate non-inferiority of an advagraf based&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen with slower dose tapering and lower starting dose of Advagraf&#xD;
      compared with a standard Advagraf-based immunosuppressive regimen in de novo renal&#xD;
      transplantation. Non inferiority will be assessed by a combined study endpoint consisting of&#xD;
      the development of biopsy-proven rejection of BANFF class Ia or higher and/or graft loss&#xD;
      and/or patient death within the first six months after renal transplantation.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The most widely used immunosuppressive regimen, in adult kidney transplant recipients,&#xD;
      consists of an induction therapy accompanied by maintenance with tacrolimus, mycophenolate&#xD;
      and steroids. In the long term, tacrolimus is the single most effective immunosuppressive&#xD;
      agent. For adult kidney transplant recipients maintenance of therapeutic levels remains&#xD;
      crucial regarding the prevention of allograft rejections. Greater blood levels variability is&#xD;
      associated with inferior graft survival as well as non-adherence. Lower variability of&#xD;
      tacrolimus blood levels after conversion to extended release tacrolimus formulations has been&#xD;
      shown. In addition, once-daily administration promotes patient adherence. The latter is one&#xD;
      of the major causes for allograft loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the first week after kidney transplantation stable tacrolimus blood levels are hardly&#xD;
      achievable. Especially extended release tacrolimus formulations often yield high tacrolimus&#xD;
      blood levels. High blood levels are a known risk factor for delayed graft function, which&#xD;
      leads to a prolonged hospitalization and a reduced graft survival. Additionally high blood&#xD;
      levels are associated with polyomavirus infections and may increase the incidence of&#xD;
      new-onset diabetes after renal transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking this into consideration, authors demand for calcineurin inhibitor (CNI)-free&#xD;
      immunosuppression or the delayed onset of CNI therapy after a stable graft function is&#xD;
      reached. This would inevitably lead to a higher rate of acute allograft rejections in the&#xD;
      early phase after kidney transplantation. Avoiding high tacrolimus levels, especially early&#xD;
      after transplantation, to minimize delayed graft function as well as long term undesirable&#xD;
      side effects, seems particularly necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For early dose adjustments of extended release tacrolimus formulations, more medical&#xD;
      experience is needed compared to immediate release formulations. More stable tacrolimus blood&#xD;
      levels can be seen after the first week of administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To avoid high blood levels of tacrolimus, especially early after transplantation, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to demonstrate in this study a non-inferiority of a low dose extended&#xD;
      release tacrolimus regimen compared to a standard extended release tacrolimus-based&#xD;
      immunosuppressive regimen in de novo renal transplantation. Given inclusion criteria and&#xD;
      excluding the exclusion criteria, participants will be randomized into two groups, a standard&#xD;
      tacrolimus administration group with daily dose adjustments within the first week after&#xD;
      transplantation and a fixed dose tacrolimus administration group, without dose adjustments&#xD;
      within the first week after transplantation. In the first 6 months after renal&#xD;
      transplantation different blood levels of tacrolimus shall be reached. In the case of the&#xD;
      standard tacrolimus administration group the investigators aim at tacrolimus blood levels of&#xD;
      7-9 ng/ml in the first 2 months after transplantation and 6-8 ng/ml for days 61 to 180. In&#xD;
      the fixed dose tacrolimus administration group, the low extended release tacrolimus dose of&#xD;
      5mg per day well no be changed in the first week after transplantation. For safety reasons&#xD;
      blinded measurements will take place in the first week and study officials will be alerted in&#xD;
      case of repeated tacrolimus levels &gt; 20 ng/ml. On days 7 to 60 the investigators aim at&#xD;
      tacrolimus blood levels of 5-7 ng/ml and from days 61 to 180 4-6 ng/ml. Non inferiority will&#xD;
      be assessed by a combined study endpoint consisting of the development of biopsy-proven&#xD;
      rejection of BANFF class Ia or higher and/or graft loss and/or patient death within the first&#xD;
      six months after renal transplantation.&#xD;
