  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed randomized controlled trial will test the effect of a low-carbohydrate diet on&#xD;
      hemoglobin A1c among individuals with elevated hemoglobin A1c that are within the range of&#xD;
      prediabetes or diabetes. Results may provide evidence about the role of carbohydrate&#xD;
      restriction in individuals with or at high risk of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In the short-term, among patients with type 2 diabetes, low-to-moderate carbohydrate diets&#xD;
      have a greater glucose-lowering effect than do high-carbohydrate diets. However, compared&#xD;
      with usual diet, the effect of a behavioral intervention promoting a&#xD;
      low-carbohydrate/high-unsaturated fat and high-protein dietary pattern among individuals with&#xD;
      prediabetes or untreated type 2 diabetes is not well understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall goal of this randomized controlled trial is to study the effect of a behavioral&#xD;
      intervention promoting a low-carbohydrate/high-unsaturated fat and high-protein dietary&#xD;
      pattern compared with usual diet on hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and other metabolic risk factors&#xD;
      among individuals with or at high risk of diabetes (HbA1c 6.0-6.9%).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 150 participants with HbA1c 6.0-6.9% will be recruited and randomly assigned to&#xD;
      either a 6-month behavioral modification program designed to reduce carbohydrate intake&#xD;
      (initial target &lt;40 g digestible carbohydrates, final target &lt;60 g digestible carbohydrates)&#xD;
      or to usual diet in a 1:1 randomization ratio.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the difference between the active intervention and control groups&#xD;
      for change in HbA1c from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes will be fasting glucose,&#xD;
      systolic blood pressure, total-to-high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol ratio, and body&#xD;
      weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings from this study may provide evidence about the role of carbohydrate restriction in&#xD;
      individuals with or at high risk of type 2 diabetes.&#xD;
