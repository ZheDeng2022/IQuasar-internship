  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Female inability to conceive a child. The purpose of this prospective randomized,&#xD;
      double-blinded, double dummy, two-arm cross-over study is to investigate the difference on&#xD;
      histological, transcriptional and immunological level in endometrium between 3x10mg&#xD;
      Dydrogesterone oral tablets and 3x200 mg Micronized progesterone intravaginal capsules for&#xD;
      the luteal support in egg cell donors. Beside that, the pharmacokinetics, the impact on the&#xD;
      peripheral immunology (by blood sampling) and the microbiota (by genital swabs) will be&#xD;
      investigated.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Blinded and packaged medication will be provided to the investigational site and dispensed to the participants. The participants, their treating physicians and the investigators will be blinded for the randomization of subjects to the treatment groups. Of both treatment medications, OD and MVP, a placebo version will be available and administered in both oocyte donation cycles. The medication will be given in a double blind double dummy fashion. All the tablets and capsules will be identical in appearance, shape, smell and taste, and packaged in the proper proportion to assure desired dosages and maintenance of the blinding.</masking_description>
