      MTN-035 is a multi-site, randomized-sequence, three-period, open label crossover study that&#xD;
      will enroll approximately 210 participants randomized (1:1:1:1:1:1) to one of six sequences&#xD;
      of rectal microbicide placebo product application. At the start of each 4-week product use&#xD;
      period, participants will receive either rectal inserts, rectal douches, or rectal&#xD;
      suppositories and be instructed to use their assigned study product prior to each receptive&#xD;
      anal intercourse (RAI) encounter during that period. Participants who do not have RAI in a&#xD;
      given week will be asked to use the product without sex. There will be a 1-week washout&#xD;
      period between each of the three product use periods. Participant follow-up will take&#xD;
      approximately 3.5 months.&#xD;
