  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Mosaicism within an embryo is defined as the presence of two or more cell populations with&#xD;
      different genotypes. Blastocysts classified as mosaic by Preimplamtation Genetic Testing for&#xD;
      Aneuploidy (PGT-A) have been reported to implant less and miscarry more frequently than&#xD;
      embryos classified as euploid. Because of the unknown impact of mosaicism on embryo&#xD;
      development, these embryos are given low priority and are discarded for transfer. However,&#xD;
      recent papers on the transfer of human embryos classified by PGT-A as mosaic suggest that&#xD;
      embryos with a low fraction of abnormal cells resulting in viable, chromosomally normal&#xD;
      ongoing pregnancies, and high-level mosaics resulting in fewer viable pregnancies, but so far&#xD;
      none producing mosaic babies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The apparent presence of mosaicism in an embryo is used as a selection criteria for embryo&#xD;
      transfer (ET), introducing a strong bias in terms of patient prognosis and embryo quality.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is also possible that some embryos are incorrectly classified as &quot;mosaic&quot;&#xD;
      due to technical variability derived from the processing of a uniform aneuploid embryo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of this study is to provide evidences about the clinical significance of chromosomal&#xD;
      mosaicism in PGT-A cycles by a prospective non-selection based methodology.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      One of the most common reasons why in vitro fertilization (IVF) is unsuccessful, or why&#xD;
      miscarriages occur, is because of chromosomal abnormalities in the embryo. Embryos with less&#xD;
      than 20% aneuploidy are considered as euploid, while those between 20-80% are reported as&#xD;
      mosaic, and those over 80% as aneuploid. Embryos with the correct number of chromosomes&#xD;
      (euploid) have a higher chance of leading to a successful pregnancy than those with the&#xD;
      incorrect number of chromosomes (aneuploid) or mosaics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mosaicism within an embryo is defined as the presence of two or more cell populations with&#xD;
      different genotypes. Preliminary data suggested that embryos identified as mosaic by&#xD;
      Preimplamtation Genetic Testing for Aneuploidy (PGT-A) may have a reduced chance of&#xD;
      implantation compared with euploid and may play a significant role in pregnancy loss.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Because of the unknown impact of mosaicism on embryo development, these embryos are given low&#xD;
      priority and are discarded for transfer. They are transferred mostly in poor prognosis&#xD;
      patients, explaining the reported lower clinical performances. However, other recent data&#xD;
      regarding the transfer of embryos diagnosed as mosaic has shown that embryos with a low&#xD;
      fraction of abnormal cells may result in viable, chromosomally normal ongoing pregnancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The apparent presence of mosaicism in an embryo is used as a selection criteria for embryo&#xD;
      transfer (ET), introducing a strong bias in terms of patient prognosis and embryo quality.&#xD;
      Additionally, it is also possible that some embryos are incorrectly classified as mosaic due&#xD;
      to technical variability derived from the processing of a uniform aneuploid embryo. Thus,&#xD;
      there is an urgent need to understand how to appropriately select and counsel patients&#xD;
      regarding such embryos.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to provide evidences about the clinical significance of chromosomal mosaicism&#xD;
      in PGT-A cycles by a prospective non-selection based methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives are to investigate the clinical predictive value for intermediate copy number&#xD;
      results consistent with the presence of low mosaicism in TE biopsies, and to validate the&#xD;
      thresholds for the classification of embryos in relation with their reproductive potential,&#xD;
      providing comprehensive data for clinicians and patients. To demonstrate these objectives, a&#xD;
      total of 878 participants are expected to be recruited in 18 months. As the datapoints&#xD;
      required for comparison concern embryo transfers rather than participants, this number could&#xD;
      be lower depending on the number of embryo transfers received by each participant.&#xD;
