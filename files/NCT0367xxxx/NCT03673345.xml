  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective surveillance of the immune response to seasonal vaccination in&#xD;
      healthy children. The study will enroll a total of approximately 220 subjects. 140 children&#xD;
      will be vaccinated with inactivated influenza vaccine (IIV) and will be divided into 4 age&#xD;
      cohorts: 20 children between 6-12 months of age, 60 children greater than 12 months of age&#xD;
      and born after 2009, 30 children with a birth date between 2006 and 2009, and 30 children&#xD;
      with a birth date between 2003 and 2006. 80 children presenting with natural influenza&#xD;
      infection prior to receipt of influenza vaccination also will be divided into 4 age cohorts:&#xD;
      20 children between 3-12 months of age, 20 children greater than 12 months of age with a&#xD;
      birth date after 2009, 20 children with a birth date between 2006 and 2009, and 20 children&#xD;
      with a birth date between 2003 and 2006. Influenza vaccines will be administered using&#xD;
      age-appropriate guidelines in all years of the study: Fluzone 0.25 mL administered&#xD;
      intramuscularly to children between 6 and 35 months of age and 0.5 mL to children 36 months&#xD;
      of age and older. Subjects will be seen at one domestic site and their participation duration&#xD;
      is 2 influenza seasons plus 1 optional season. The primary hypothesis being tested in this&#xD;
      study is that there will be differences in the specificity, magnitude and functionality of&#xD;
      CD4 T cell and B cell reactivity in a cohort of children depending on early childhood&#xD;
      exposures. The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the relationship between&#xD;
      influenza virus exposure, infection and vaccine history, and CD4 T cell reactivity in a&#xD;
      cohort of children with well documented influenza exposures.&#xD;

&#xD;
          7. Receipt of immunoglobulin or another blood product within the year prior to study&#xD;
             enrollment&#xD;
