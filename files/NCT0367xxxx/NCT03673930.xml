      indicated that preparations of Z. armatum may also be beneficial to cognitive function. The&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Zanthozylum armatum (Z. armatum) is an perennial shrub found in India and across Southeast&#xD;
      Asia. Preparations of the bark, fruit and seeds of Z. armatum have been extensively used in&#xD;
      traditional Indian medicine. For example, the fruits and seeds have been employed as an&#xD;
      aromatic tonic in fever and dyspepsia and the essential oil of the fruits has exhibited&#xD;
      antibacterial, antifungal and anthelmintic properties. Furthermore, the dried fruits are used&#xD;
      as spice, especially in Nepalese and Sichuan cuisine with increasing popularity across&#xD;
      Europe. With regard to physiological effects relevant to brain function, Z. armatum has also&#xD;
      been traditionally used as a cardio-depressant; these vasodilatory properties have recently&#xD;
      being linked to its antagonistic effect on calcium ion channel function as demonstrated in&#xD;
      isolated rabbit aorta tissue. In addition, the observed anti-inflammatory and antioxidant&#xD;
      effects of preparations of Z. armatum may serve to beneficially impact cognition with chronic&#xD;
      administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although direct effects of Z. armatum on brain function have yet to be assessed; Zanthozylum&#xD;
      fruit comprises one constituent of the traditional Japanese herbal medicine Daikenchuto (DKT)&#xD;
      where some data do exist. In a series of trials investigating the effects of DKT on learning&#xD;
      and memory function in mice, it was established that the extract of Zanthozylum fruit&#xD;
      contained in DKT alone that was associated with reductions in escape latency in the Morris&#xD;
      Water Maze task. Interestingly, the authors also revealed that it was the amide&#xD;
      hydroxy-É‘-sanshool (HAS) isolated from the Zanthozylum fruit extract that was associated with&#xD;
      these effects, speculating that the effect of HAS on escape latencies was due to a&#xD;
      facilitation effect of HAS on acetylcholine release.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the evidence of potentially relevant mechanisms of action and initial evidence of&#xD;
      cognitive effects of HAS in murine models, the aim of this study is to assess the acute and&#xD;
      chronic effects of Z. armatum on cognitive function, mood, and cerebral blood flow in healthy&#xD;
      adults aged 30 to 55 years.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must self-assess themselves as being in good health&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Aged 30 to 55 years at the time of giving consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are proficient in English equivalent to IELTS band 6 or above&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any pre-existing medical condition/illness which will impact taking part in the&#xD;
             study NOTE: the explicit exceptions to this are controlled (medicated) hypertension,&#xD;
             arthritis, asthma, hay fever, high cholesterol and reflux-related conditions. There&#xD;
             may be other, unforeseen, exceptions and these will be considered on a case-by-case&#xD;
             basis; i.e. participants may be allowed to progress to screening if they have a&#xD;
             condition/illness which would not interact with the active treatments or impede&#xD;
             performance&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently taking prescription medications or dietary supplements including omega&#xD;
             fatty acids / fish oils NOTE: the explicit exceptions to this are hormone replacement&#xD;
             treatments for female participants where symptoms are stable, those medications used&#xD;
             in the treatment of arthritis, high blood pressure, high cholesterol and&#xD;
             reflux-related conditions; and those taken 'as needed' in the treatment of asthma and&#xD;
             hay fever. As above, there may be other instances of medication use which, where no&#xD;
             interaction with the active treatments is likely, participants may be able to progress&#xD;
             to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have planned a surgery requiring general anaesthesia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have high blood pressure (systolic over 159 mm Hg or diastolic over 99 mm Hg)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a Body Mass Index (BMI) outside of the range 18-35 kg/m2&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are pregnant, seeking to become pregnant or lactating&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have learning difficulties, dyslexia&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a visual impairment that cannot be corrected with glasses or contact lenses&#xD;
             (including colour-blindness)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Smoker or regular consumption of nicotine containing products e.g. patches, gum,&#xD;
             vaping&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history of alcohol or drug abuse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Excessive caffeine intake (&gt;500 mg per day)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have food intolerances/sensitivities, especially against citrus fruits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any health condition that would prevent fulfilment of the study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are unable to complete all of the study assessments&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are currently participating in other clinical or nutrition intervention studies, or&#xD;
             have in the past 4 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Do not have a bank account (required for payment)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Are non-compliant with regards treatment consumption&#xD;
