  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background Blood flow restriction training (BFRT) uses a specialized tourniquet system to&#xD;
      restrict arterial inflow and venous outflow to the limb during low-load resistance exercise.&#xD;
      BFRT has the potential to augment strength gains for rehabilitation patients who are unable&#xD;
      to tolerate high intensity resistance training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To determine if BFRT will accelerate the recovery of thigh muscle function and&#xD;
      strength in post-operative TKA compared to a standard post-operative rehabilitation protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quadriceps Strength: dynamometry (hand held)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient Reported Outcomes Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score, Jr Veterans Rand -12&#xD;
      Functional Measures Timed stair ascent Four square Test 5x Sit to Stand Test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Open label randomized clinical trial with a 1:1 allocation in random sized&#xD;
      blocks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size Based on a Pre-TKA Quadriceps Maximal Voluntary Isometric Contraction mean of 18&#xD;
      with a standard deviation of 8, expecting a 20% improvement of MVIC with BFRT compared to&#xD;
      standard Physical Therapy, with an α of 0.05 and β of 0.20 (80% power), the sample size is 63&#xD;
      in each arm. To account for a 20% drop-out rate, a total of 75 subjects will be enrolled in&#xD;
      each arm Study Arms Control arm: Subjects will receive American College of Sports Medicine&#xD;
      guided-strength training Experimental: Subjects will receive BFRT strength training as part&#xD;
      of their post-operative physical therapy program for two months during normal post-op rehab.&#xD;
