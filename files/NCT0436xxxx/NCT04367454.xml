  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Out-of-hospital care during Chemical-Biological-Radiological-Nuclear-explosive (CBRNe) events&#xD;
      have recently evolved, but the available knowledge is still extremely partial. In particular,&#xD;
      the debate is still ongoing regarding which life-saving maneuvers should be implemented in&#xD;
      the pre-decontamination phase while wearing CBRNe personal protective equipment (PPE). The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesized that PPE may lengthen the execution times and worsen the success&#xD;
      rate of invasive and non-invasive procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial involves residents in emergency medicine and anesthesia/critical care of the&#xD;
      University of Padova (Italy) with the following procedures performed on high-fidelity&#xD;
      manikins, after being divided into two groups (wearing and not wearing PPE): positioning of&#xD;
      peripheral venous access; intraosseous access; drug preparation and administration; tension&#xD;
      pneumothorax (PNX) needle decompression; tourniquet positioning; chest compressions. The&#xD;
      primary outcome was the chest compressions depth mean difference between the two groups. As&#xD;
      secondary outcomes, the investigators measured differences between the two groups in: the&#xD;
      percentages of correct release during chest compressions; chest compressions rate (beats per&#xD;
      minute); and the times needed to complete the above-mentioned procedures (other than chest&#xD;
      compressions).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators expect that PPE will reduce CPR quality or delay the completion of the&#xD;
      procedures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-center, randomized (1:1), parallel-group, manikin trial comparing times of&#xD;
      execution and quality of life-saving procedures performed by residents while wearing PPE for&#xD;
      CBRNe events versus no PPE. The trial was deemed exempt from review by the local Ethics&#xD;
      Committee (No. 0045954/2019). The study was conducted aiming to reduce carbon footprint and&#xD;
      increase sustainability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population The trial involves Senior Emergency Medicine (EM) and Anesthesiology and&#xD;
      Critical Care (ACC) residents (PGY-4 and -5) from the residency programs of the University of&#xD;
      Padova (Padova, Italy), recruited via email by the study coordinator (GM) without selection.&#xD;
      Eligible residents are certified as proficient at the procedures described in the next&#xD;
      section by the respective residency board, being this a prerequisite to qualify as a PGY-4&#xD;
      and -5 in Italy. The subjects participating in the study don't receive any incentives.&#xD;
      Written consent is asked prior to the beginning. The study is organized at the &quot;SIMULARTI&quot;&#xD;
      medical simulation center of the University of Padova in Padova, Italy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventions and Procedures Residents are involved in performing the following procedures on&#xD;
      the ground on high fidelity manikins: two rescuers CPR (SUSIE - Gaumard Scientific, Miami,&#xD;
      FL); tactical tourniquet application (with a Combat Application Tourniquet速, CAT Resources,&#xD;
      Rock Hill, SC; on a Trauma Hal - Gaumard Scientific, Miami, FL); tension PNX needle&#xD;
      decompression (Truman Trauma X - TruCorp, Lurgan, N. Ireland); positioning of peripheral&#xD;
      venous access, intraosseous vascular access (with EZ-IO速 - Teleflex, Wayne, PA), and drug&#xD;
      preparation and administration (Code Blue III Adult - Gaumard Scientific, Miami, FL). Each&#xD;
      procedure is accomplished by the algorithms collected in an operations manual made available&#xD;
      to the researchers only, and verbally disclosed to the participants before their attempt (see&#xD;
      Online Supplement 1). The participants do not receive any feedback, neither verbal nor&#xD;
      visual, during the execution of the procedures. Subjects in the intervention group wear a&#xD;
      Tyvek pro-tech速 &quot;C&quot; gear (Bonetti, Milano, Italy), a full visor SGE 400 mask (EN 136:98 CL3)&#xD;
      connected to an A2B2E2K2-P3 R filter (Spasciani, Milano, Italy), and well-fitting,&#xD;
      non-sterile Mapa Ultranitril 480 gloves (Mapa SAS, Colombes, France). Subjects in the control&#xD;
      group only wear well-fitting, medical examination nitrile gloves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the end of the procedures under investigation, participants from the control group are&#xD;
      given the possibility to perform the procedures wearing CBRNe PPE, since this is a training&#xD;
      session part of their curricular activities. Finally, an anonymous questionnaire was&#xD;
      administered to the participants to evaluate their perception of the experience (Online&#xD;
      Supplement 2). The questionnaire was composed of 10 items - 7 positive and 3 negative - that&#xD;
      participants had to rate using a 5 point Likert scale (1=totally disagree; 2=disagree;&#xD;
      3=uncertain; 4=agree; 5=totally agree). The internal consistency of the questionnaire was&#xD;
      measured using Cronbach's alfa.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization For the 1:1 allocation of the residents, a computer-generated list of random&#xD;
      numbers is used. Participants are randomly assigned following variable block sizes of 2 and 4&#xD;
      to either the intervention group (in which they wore CBRNe PPEs) or to a control group (in&#xD;
      which they used only one pair of nitrile gloves) (Figure 1). Also, the participants perform&#xD;
      each procedure in a random order according to a computer-generated sequence. Randomization is&#xD;
      prepared by a researcher not directly involved with the experiments. The allocation of&#xD;
      subjects and order of the procedures are concealed by using sequentially numbered, opaque,&#xD;
      stapled envelopes, and upheld until each participant was in the simulation rooms. The&#xD;
      experiment coordinator (MP) opens the envelopes and assigns participants to group and&#xD;
      procedures. Blinding of participants and researchers involved in the experiment is&#xD;
      unfortunately not possible. Only the outcome assessor and data analyst (SS) is kept blinded&#xD;
      to the allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes The primary outcome is the difference in sternum to spine chest compressions (CCs)&#xD;
      depth during CPR between the two groups. Secondary outcomes are the differences in CCs&#xD;
      average rates per minute, percentage of CCs full release, times for completion of tourniquet&#xD;
      positioning, PNX decompression, positioning of a peripheral venous catheter and intraosseous&#xD;
      access, and drug preparation and administration. As tertiary outcome, the overall&#xD;
      participants' perception of this CBRNe simulated training at the end of the session is&#xD;
      measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection In each scenario, a researcher collects times with a stopwatch and monitors&#xD;
      the correct execution of procedures. In case of errors, the participant is stopped and&#xD;
      granted a second attempt, but is excluded from the study. As for CPR, data are collected&#xD;
      using UNI速 Unified Simulator Control Software ver 2.41.1.0 (Gaumard Scientific, Miami, FL).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample Size and Statistical Analysis The investigators calculated that group sample sizes of&#xD;
      18 and 18 would be required to detect a difference of 5.0 mm in CCs depth with a standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD) of 5.0 mm, at a significance level (alpha) of 0.05 and at least 80% power,&#xD;
      using a two-sided Mann-Whitney test, assuming that the actual distribution could be&#xD;
      non-normal. Qualitative data are analyzed descriptively through their distribution frequency.&#xD;
      Quantitative data are tested with a Shapiro-Wilk test for normality. Results are presented as&#xD;
      mean with SD, and differences tested with independent t-test in case of normally distributed&#xD;
      data with equal variance (tested with Levene's test; if not true: Welch test). Otherwise,&#xD;
      results are presented as median and interquartile range (IQR), and differences are tested&#xD;
      using a Mann-Whitney test. All tests are two-sided and p values &lt;0.05 are considered&#xD;
      statistically significant. An estimated difference with 95% confidence interval (CI) is&#xD;
      reported for the difference between testing conditions. Statistical software JASP (ver&#xD;
      0.11.1; JASP Team, 2019) is used to analyze the results.&#xD;
