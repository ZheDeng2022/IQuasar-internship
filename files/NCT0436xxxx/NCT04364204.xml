  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preterm birth complications are the leading cause of neonatal mortality and account for over&#xD;
      one million neonatal deaths annually. About 12% of babies are born before 37 weeks of&#xD;
      gestation, and are at risk for hypothermia, hypoglycemia, infections, and mortality during&#xD;
      the first 28 days of life. Kangaroo Mother Care (KMC) has been shown to reduce hypothermia,&#xD;
      neonatal infections and neonatal mortality, while improving weight gain and mother-infant&#xD;
      attachment; however, implementation to scale has been slow. The BEMPU® bracelet offers the&#xD;
      opportunity to monitor the body temperature of newborns for the early detection of&#xD;
      hypothermia and to increase the uptake of KMC. Further research is needed to evaluate the&#xD;
      impact of the BEMPU® bracelet on KMC practices and neonatal health outcomes and facilitate&#xD;
      its adoption in low-resource settings. The goal of this research is to evaluate its effect on&#xD;
      KMC practices and neonatal health outcomes in Ghana. Evidence of a significant impact on&#xD;
      outcomes will provide critical evidence to facilitate prompt identification of hypothermia,&#xD;
      maximize the benefits of KMC, decrease the risk of neonatal death, and impact the leading&#xD;
      cause of neonatal mortality in Ghana and other settings.&#xD;

      This study will evaluate the effect of the bracelet on KMC practices and neonatal health&#xD;
      outcomes in LBW infants using a randomized controlled trial. Infants currently being treated&#xD;
      in the KMC or neonatal wards of the participating hospitals will be screened for eligibility&#xD;
      by study nurses. After obtaining parental consent, infants will be randomly assigned with a&#xD;
      1:1 ratio to KMC with and without the BEMPU® bracelet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A standardized questionnaire will be administered to each mother to collect information on&#xD;
      socio-demographic characteristics and contact information. As is the standard of care, all&#xD;
      mothers regardless of study arm will be taught how to provide KMC, how to monitor the&#xD;
      infant's condition and recognize dangerous clinical signs during KMC and will be supported by&#xD;
      a nurse during initial attempts at practicing KMC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mothers of infants randomly allocated to the intervention arm will be taught to use the&#xD;
      bracelet. The meaning of the audiovisual alarm will be explained as well as the measures to&#xD;
      be taken if the device indicates any sign of hypothermia. There will not be any additional&#xD;
      training beyond that pertaining to the BEMPU® bracelet. The study nurse will then place the&#xD;
      BEMPU® bracelet on the wrist of the infant. Infants in the intervention arm will wear the&#xD;
      bracelet for up to 28 days post-discharge.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After discharge, participants in both the intervention and control arms will receive two&#xD;
      study visits; one at 7 days post discharge and one at 28 days post-discharge. During each&#xD;
      visit, infants will receive a physical examination to collect weight, length, head&#xD;
      circumference and axillary temperature, and additional data will be collected on history of&#xD;
      illnesses, care-seeking and treatment, KMC and feeding practices, and frequency of use of the&#xD;
      bracelet (if applicable).&#xD;

    <description>Kangaroo mother care involves early, continuous and prolonged skin-to-skin contact between a mother and her newborn, frequent and exclusive breastfeeding and early discharge from hospital. The BEMPU bracelet, also known as the BEMPU Tempwatch, is a silicone band with a thermistor metal cup that emits an audio alarm and flashes an orange light when the body temperature drops below 36.5⁰C, signaling hypothermia and prompting caregiver to provide thermal care.</description>
