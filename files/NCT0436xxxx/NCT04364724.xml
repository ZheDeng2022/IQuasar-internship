  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients with Multiple Myeloma are monitored for disease progression and for response to&#xD;
      treatment by the treating hematologist or oncologist. Laboratory tests are usually utilized&#xD;
      for these purposes. The role of imaging is confined to follow-up the progression of visible&#xD;
      bone lesions. We suggest that microscopic bone lesions impair bone structure well before they&#xD;
      grow enough to be visible on a CT scan. This impairment of bone strength can probably be&#xD;
      captured by application of CT-based finite element analysis to the CT scans that were&#xD;
      performed for monitoring of progression of the disease.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiple myeloma (MM) is the most common primary bone malignancy, caused by proliferation of&#xD;
      plasma cells secreting immunoglobulins. Active MM (aMM) is characterized in many patients by&#xD;
      multiple lytic bone lesions, presenting with pain in the involved bones (e.g. pelvis, spine,&#xD;
      etc.). In a recent publication, key-opinion leaders of multiple-myeloma state &quot;MM-induced&#xD;
      bone disease is a hallmark of MM; up to 80% of patients present with osteolytic bone lesions&#xD;
      at diagnosis and have an increased risk of skeletal-related events (SREs) associated with&#xD;
      increased morbidity and mortality&quot; (Terpos et al, 2018). Approximately 60% of myeloma&#xD;
      patients will develop a fracture during the disease course&quot; (Terpos et al, 2018). Current CT&#xD;
      scans provide qualitative measures of bone involvement detected only after irreversible&#xD;
      damage has occurred and which cannot predict disease evolution so to optimize treatment and&#xD;
      enhance life quality and longevity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical treatment modalities, including multi-agent chemotherapy and bone marrow&#xD;
      transplantation, may stop progression of MM, and prevent further bone lesions. Myeloma&#xD;
      response to therapy is usually monitored by measurement of the monocloncal protein which is&#xD;
      secreted by the malignant plasma cells into the blood and urine. This protein includes an&#xD;
      intact immunoglobulin - M-SPIKE - which is measured by serum protein electrophoresis (SPEP)&#xD;
      and, Circulating free light chains - kappa and lambda. Usually one of the chains is&#xD;
      &quot;involved&quot; in the disease; The level of M-SPIKE and the ratio of the &quot;involved&quot; to&#xD;
      &quot;uninvolved&quot; chains is used to monitor disease progression. The role of imaging technologies&#xD;
      in monitoring progression of the disease is less defined. Low-dose total body CT scans are&#xD;
      recommended as second-line imaging (total body MRI is first-line) during the initial&#xD;
      diagnostic workup of MM by the most current guidelines of National Institute for Healthcare&#xD;
      Excellence (NICE, 2016). The guidelines encourage further research of the role of various&#xD;
      imaging modalities in treatment of MM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Newer imaging techniques are replacing skeletal surveys for assessing myeloma related bone&#xD;
      disease in people with newly diagnosed myeloma. However, the most effective tech-nique is not&#xD;
      known. Outcomes of interest are lesion detection, sensitivity and specificity for myeloma&#xD;
      related bone disease, patient acceptability, incremental upstaging, radiation exposure, risk&#xD;
      of second primary cancer, the impact of additional information on predicting progression-free&#xD;
      survival, overall survival and skeletal related events.&quot; (NICE, 2016) As previously stated,&#xD;
      current imaging modalities visualize bone lesions but do not quantify their progression, any&#xD;
      response to therapy or their impact on bone strength. A novel scientific tool that describes&#xD;
      bone's response by mathematical equations and is based on CT scans of MM patients, allows to&#xD;
      construct a 3-D model of patient's femurs and vertebrae including the inhomogeneous material&#xD;
      properties, virtually loads the bones by physiological loads associated with patient's weight&#xD;
      and determine the deformations and strains by a computer simulation. This technology, termed&#xD;
      CTFEA, allows a quantitative evaluation of bone's strength and risk of fracture, was&#xD;
      double-blinded validated ex-vivo, and clinically validated in a retrospective clinical trial&#xD;
      on a cohort of 50 patients with metastatic tumors to their femurs (Sternheim et al, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combining the engineering and scientific expertise with the clinical knowledge and database&#xD;
      of MM patients accumulated during the past ten years, may identify by monitoring femurs' and&#xD;
      vertebrae' strength the evolution of MM, and trigger the need of prophylactic surgeries. Such&#xD;
      CTFEA has the potential to revolutionize MM treatment by providing the MDs quantitative&#xD;
      scientific measures to monitor and change treatment options so to optimize medication&#xD;
      prescription and enhance life-quality and longevity of MM patients on one hand, and determine&#xD;
      with high level of accuracy the risk of impending fracture due to metastatic tumors to the&#xD;
      femurs and vertebrae.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preliminary results on a cohort of seven MM patients (Cohen et al, 2017), has recently been&#xD;
      presented in Dec 2017 at the ASH conference in the USA. These results showed the potential of&#xD;
      assisting MDs to determine disease evolution and treatment. Since the vertebrae are prone to&#xD;
      MM involvement, we plan to validate the CTFEA methods for such vertebrae with MM involvement&#xD;
      by comparing experiments performed on cadaveric human vertebrae with the computational&#xD;
      simulation. In addition, we propose to in-vivo validate the accuracy and predictability of&#xD;
      patient specific CTFEA of vertebrae and femurs by a clinical trial on a cohort of MM patients&#xD;
      treated at Sourasky medical center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale CTFEA may add efficacy to CT scans used for follow-up of disease progression. This&#xD;
      analysis can detect differences of as little as 10% in bone strength. It has the ability to&#xD;
      detect changes even in normal looking bone on CT and not just in lytic lesions. In addition,&#xD;
      CTFEA characterises the effect of each myeloma lesion on bone structure and calculates the&#xD;
      risk of a pathologic fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hypothesize that CTFEA analysis of LDTBCT will detect changes over time in patients with a&#xD;
      dynamic disease, even when these changes in CT are undetectable to the human eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To observe CTFEA-determined bone strength changes over time in patients with Active MM.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To measure CTFEA changes over a period of 12 months in lumbar vertebrae and femurs of&#xD;
           patients with AMM.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine correlation between CTFEA and clinical indicators of response to treatment&#xD;
           (e.g. light chains, clinical staging of bone lesions).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare CTFEA changes over time between patients responding to AMM treatment and&#xD;
           those who do not respond to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods Study design This is a prospective study with one patient group. All patients will&#xD;
      undergo three Low-Dose Total Body CT (LDTBCT) scans as part of diagnostic workup for MM,&#xD;
      which represents our current common practice: at 0, 6 and 12 months into treatment (or 3 CT&#xD;
      scans at least 6 months apart).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All three scans will be sent for CTFEA, which is not part of the common practice. The CTFEA&#xD;
      results will be compared to clinical assessments as per patient files and light chain values&#xD;
      on blood work. Changes in lesion size will be compared to changes that the lesion inflicts in&#xD;
      bone structure and changes in the risk of fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bone strength in both femurs and lower lumbar vertebra will be analyzed even where there are&#xD;
      no lytic lesions for changes in bone strength.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results will be correlated with Myeloma clinical variables including baseline demographic and&#xD;
      disease charateristics, therapy details and response to treatment over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will continue followup, for recording of skeletal related events (fratures or new&#xD;
      lytic lesions)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measured parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary and secondary disease diagnoses and their ICD-9 codes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient ambulatory status at time of MM diagnosis: independent walker; cane ambulator;&#xD;
           walker ambulator; wheel chair bound.&#xD;

        3. Time since patient was independent walker, ECOG performance status (Oken et al,&#xD;
           1982)(Appendix A).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Treatment for osteoporosis and duration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Date of diagnosis of active MM (and preceding plasma cell dyscrasia if relevant)&#xD;

    <description>CTFEA is a computerized analysis of CT-scans which simulates stress testing of finite element models of various bones (in this study - femurs and vertebrae).&#xD;
No intervention is planned - the study is observational. CT scans are performed for follow-up as an accepted standard of care. Secondary use of CT scans for CTFEA is in addition to the standard of care.&#xD;
In a case when CTFEA analysis detects a high risk of pathologic fracture, the treating hematologist will be informed and will refer the patient for evaluation at the National Unit of Orthopedic Oncology.</description>
