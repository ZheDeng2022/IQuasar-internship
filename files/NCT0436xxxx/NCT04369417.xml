  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The proposed research has the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based off findings from the &quot;Development of a Resiliency Program for Siblings of Children&#xD;
      with Autism Spectrum Disorder&quot; qualitative focus group study (protocol 2019P002284), the aim&#xD;
      is to determine the feasibility and acceptability, of an 8-session Relaxation Response&#xD;
      Resiliency (SibChat) program for siblings of children with ASD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We primarily aim to test the preliminary effectiveness of a pilot waitlist controlled trial&#xD;
      on improving resiliency and stress coping, This will be assessed by comparing Baseline-3 mo.&#xD;
      scores on primary and secondary outcome measures between the Immediate and Waitlist control&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among participants randomized to both conditions, we secondarily aim to investigate the&#xD;
      extent of pre-post changes in primary and secondary outcomes. Among immediate condition group&#xD;
      only, we also aim to assess whether end-of-treatment (3 mo. post enrollment) improvements&#xD;
      will be sustained at 6-mo. post enrollment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      This intervention will be a modified version of Dr. Elyse Park's evidence-based 8-week&#xD;
      multimodal treatment which is designed to promote adaptation to stress and promotion of&#xD;
      resiliency. The program is an 8 session, 1 hour a week multi modal intervention that&#xD;
      incorporates relaxation techniques, stress awareness discussion, and adaptive strategies for&#xD;
      coping with stress. This study will refine an 8-session group virtual-delivered resiliency&#xD;
      treatment program consisting of 8 virtual group 1-1 Â½ hour sessions. The goal of this study&#xD;
      would be to advance our ultimate objective to implement a national sibling resiliency&#xD;
      program.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility assessed by the survey retention post intervention.</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among participants randomized to both conditions, feasibility is assessed by the number of participants who completed the T2 and T3 surveys, 3 months and 6 months post baseline, respectively.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability assessed using the participant feedback survey</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>The participant feedback survey is a questionnaire made up of likert scales and open ended questions designed to record acceptability of the SibChat-3RP program on topics including length of sessions, number of sessions, and virtual delivery.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Acceptability assessed by relaxation response adherence</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among participants randomized to both conditions, relaxation response adherence is measured at T1, T2 and T3. Relaxation response adherence is a 1-item likert scale that indicates how often participants practice relaxation response exercises. Acceptability is determined based on whether participants indicate that they practice relaxation response exercises at least bimonthly 3 months post intervention.</description>

    <measure>Effectiveness of trial on improving stress coping ability (assessed using Measure of Current Status-A)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Measure of Current Status-A is a questionnaire - the score on the questionnaire is used to indicate stress coping ability. A change in score indicates a change in indicated stress coping ability. Comparison of intervention and wait list control 3 months after baseline (T1).</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Effectiveness of trial on improving resiliency (assessed using Current Experiences Scale)</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Current experiences Scale is a questionnaire. Improved resiliency is measured base upon change in questionnaire score. Comparison of intervention and wait list control 3 months after baseline (T1).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Pre-post intervention changes as measured by change in primary outcome scores of resiliency and stress coping.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among participants randomized to both conditions, pre-post intervention changes in primary outcome scores of resiliency and stress coping will be assessed using the scores from the questionnaire (includes all primary outcome scores indicated above).</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Sustained improvements in primary outcomes of resiliency and stress coping as measured by sustained change in primary outcome scores.</measure>
    <time_frame>3 months</time_frame>
    <description>Among immediate condition group only, assess whether end-of-treatment (3 mo. post enrollment) improvements in primary outcome scores (resiliency and stress coping indicated above; collected using a questionnaire) will be sustained at 6-mo. post enrollment.</description>
