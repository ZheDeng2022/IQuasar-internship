      Background Chronic temporomandibular disorders (TMD) pain is an undertreated condition in&#xD;
      Sweden despite the fact that national guidelines includes effective treatment options. These&#xD;
      guidelines recommend multimodal treatment with a behavioral approach. Internet-based&#xD;
      intervention is an appealing modality for multimodal TMD treatment, enabling more patients to&#xD;
      be reached and treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To investigate the treatment effect of an internet-based multimodal pain program&#xD;
      (iMPP) on chronic TMD pain. As the study progressed, it also became a measure to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of running a larger randomized controlled trial.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Chronic temporomandibular disorders (TMD) pain is an undertreated condition in&#xD;
      Sweden despite the fact that national guidelines includes effective treatment options. These&#xD;
      guidelines recommend multimodal treatment with a behavioral approach. Internet-based&#xD;
      intervention is an appealing modality for multimodal TMD treatment, enabling more patients to&#xD;
      be reached and treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective To investigate the treatment effect of an internet-based multimodal pain program&#xD;
      (iMPP) on chronic TMD pain. As the study progressed, it also became a measure to evaluate the&#xD;
      feasibility of running a larger randomized controlled trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN An unblinded parallel-arm RCT pilot study with equal allocation was conducted.&#xD;
      Participants were randomized to the iMPP or to an active control. They were recruited from a&#xD;
      general dental care clinic (Fäladstorget) within the National Dental Care Skåne, Sweden.&#xD;
      Examination and allocated treatment were free of charge for participants and no other&#xD;
      financial compensation was given. This study is part of a large research project with the&#xD;
      primary objective to study changes in the brain after treatment in patients with chronic TMD&#xD;
      pain. Therefore, participants went through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain pre-&#xD;
      and post-treatment. The study was approved by the Ethics Review Board in Lund, Sweden (No.&#xD;
      2016/6). This study was not registered in a public trials registry due to its feasibility&#xD;
      character.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PARTICIPANTS Participants had to fulfill the following criteria: (1) age between 18 and 75&#xD;
      years; (2) at least one of the TMD pain diagnoses myalgia, myofascial pain with referral,&#xD;
      headache attributed to TMD or arthralgia according to the Diagnostic Criteria for&#xD;
      Temporomandibular Disorders (DC/TMD) {Schiffman, 2014 #4}; (3) chronic TMD pain (≥3 months),&#xD;
      experienced once a week or more often, with an intensity of ≥3 on an 0-10 numeric rating&#xD;
      scale (NRS); (4) access to a computer with an internet connection and a mobile phone; (5)&#xD;
      sufficient computer literacy and (6) mastery of the Swedish language. Exclusion criteria&#xD;
      were: (1) chronic inflammatory systemic disease; (2) all psychiatric disorders except&#xD;
      depression and anxiety (due to high comorbidity); (3) occlusal splint therapy in the past 12&#xD;
      months; (4) ongoing extensive dental treatment; and (5) conditions contradicting MRI&#xD;
      examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment of participants started in April 2016 and ended in December 2017. Screening was&#xD;
      paused during holiday periods (June-August) and during February-April in 2017 due to&#xD;
      technical issues with the MRI machine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE To identify potential participants, all consecutive adult patients visiting for a&#xD;
      regular dental check-up were screened. If eligible for the inclusion examination and&#xD;
      interested in participation oral and written information about the study was given and a new&#xD;
      appointment was booked. The inclusion examination was performed and written informed consent&#xD;
      was received. Permuted block randomization with a fixed block size of ten was used. If&#xD;
      allocated to iMPP, the participants received working material by mail and the URL to the&#xD;
      program was sent by email. Treatment start was assisted by phone. If allocated to treatment&#xD;
      with occlusal splint, alginate impressions and index were prepared at the same appointment as&#xD;
      the inclusion examination and a new appointment was booked for delivering the splint.&#xD;
      Follow-up was performed at three and six months after treatment start by questionnaires sent&#xD;
      by mail. Participants also went through an MRI of the brain at baseline (after randomization&#xD;
      but before treatment start) and at six months after treatment start at Skåne University&#xD;
      Hospital, Malmö, Sweden.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING The TMD screening tool 2Q/TMD was used to check for initial eligibility {Lövgren,&#xD;
      2016 #293} {Lövgren, 2016 #277}. The screening questions were (Q1) &quot;Do you have pain in your&#xD;
      temple, face, jaw or jaw joint once a week or more?&quot; and (Q2) &quot;Do you have pain once a week&#xD;
      or more when you open your mouth or chew?&quot;. Participants had to answer yes to at least one of&#xD;
      the questions and also not fulfill any of the exclusion criteria previously mentioned to be&#xD;
      eligible for the inclusion examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INCLUSION EXAMINATION All participants underwent a standardized examination according to the&#xD;
      DC/TMD to control for eligibility and to collect baseline data. The DC/TMD includes a&#xD;
      clinical examination and questionnaires described below {Schiffman, 2014 #4}. Demographic&#xD;
      data and pre-treatment expectancies on allocated treatment were also assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLINICAL EXAMINATION The clinical DC/TMD examination comprises a standardized assessment of&#xD;
      pain and headache locations, mouth opening capacity, pain on mandibular movement, pain on&#xD;
      palpation, including the presence of referred pain on palpation and temporomandibular joint&#xD;
      noises. The clinical examinations were carried out by one of two general dentists calibrated&#xD;
      by the DC/TMD Training and Calibration Center at Malmö University, Sweden {Vilanova, 2015&#xD;
      #1}. Re-calibration of the dentists was performed mid-way through the recruitment phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The DC/TMD Symptom Questionnaire was used to assess pain symptoms involving the jaw, jaw&#xD;
      noise and locking and headache. Data from this questionnaire were combined with the findings&#xD;
      in the clinical examination for diagnosis according to DC/TMD {Schiffman, 2014 #4}.&#xD;
&#xD;
      QUESTIONNAIRES Pain The Graded Chronic Pain Scale was used to assess the subdomains&#xD;
      characteristic pain intensity (CPI; mean of pain intensity for reported worst, current and&#xD;
      average pain) and pain-related disability (DS; mean of how much facial pain changed the&#xD;
      patient's ability to participate in daily activities, social activities and work). The&#xD;
      questionnaire includes the assessment of pain intensity and pain-related disability that are&#xD;
      scored on a 0-10 NRS (modified from{Von Korff, 2011 #279}).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A full-body pain drawing was used to assess pain locations and distribution {Pain, 2020&#xD;
      #278}. The pain distribution was categorized as local (in face area), (iii) regional pain&#xD;
      (pain in the neck area in addition to local pain) and (iv) widespread pain (pain at any other&#xD;
      site of the body in addition to local or regional pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical functioning The Jaw Functional Limitation Scale (JLFS-8) was used to assess the&#xD;
      overall functional limitation of the masticatory system {Ohrbach, 2008 #280}. The Oral&#xD;
      Behaviors Checklist was used to assess the self-reported frequency of oral parafunctional&#xD;
      behaviors during awake time {Markiewicz, 2006 #281}.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emotional functioning The Patient Health Questionnaire was used to assess depression and the&#xD;
      Patient Health Questionnaire-15 was used to assess non-specific physical symptoms {Kroenke,&#xD;
      2001 #282}{Kroenke, 2002 #283}. Anxiety was assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorders&#xD;
      Assessment-7 {Spitzer, 2006 #285}. Stress was assessed with the Perceived Stress Scale-10 and&#xD;
      the Pain Catastrophizing Scale was used to assess catastrophizing {Nordin, 2013&#xD;
      #286}{Sullivan, 1995 #287}.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient outcome expectancy A Swedish translation of the Stanford Expectations of Treatment&#xD;
      Scale (SETS) was used to assess pre-treatment expectancies on allocated treatment {Younger,&#xD;
      2012 #288}.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT ARMS INTERVENTION The iMPP is based on CBT and self-management principles that help&#xD;
      patient cope with chronic TMD pain. It was developed by orofacial pain specialists at the&#xD;
      Department of Orofacial Pain and Jaw Function, Malmö University, Sweden, in collaboration&#xD;
      with Psykologpartners AB (a Swedish supplier of internet-based psychological treatment).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iMPP translates a face-to-face therapy to a software platform program. It can be reached&#xD;
      through an URL wherever an internet connection is available and access requires a 2-factor&#xD;
      authentication system. A paper-back workbook with homework assignments is included in&#xD;
      addition to the internet program. The iMPP consists of seven treatment modules; each&#xD;
      described in Table 1 and print screens of the program is shown in Figure 1. Recurrent in each&#xD;
      module was a rating of pain frequency, stress levels and life satisfaction to keep track of&#xD;
      progression (Fig. 1). Seven weeks was the intended treatment duration: 1 module/week; 40&#xD;
      min/module online plus time for homework assignments. However, access to the program was not&#xD;
      time-limited in this pilot study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The iMPP was designed to be used without HCP involvement, however, in this study, guidance&#xD;
      was included in order to increase adherence. A dentist (JL) provided a start-up phone call,&#xD;
      follow-up phone calls after each finished module and also sent reminders if necessary. The&#xD;
      dentist was also available for additional support through the chat function in the program&#xD;
      (asynchronous). At the start-up phone call, participants were guided through the functions in&#xD;
      the program and informed about time requirements for the treatment. Follow-up phone calls&#xD;
      involved individualized support and feedback; and if participants were unreachable at&#xD;
      scheduled follow-up calls, a message through the chat function was sent with the prompt to&#xD;
      get in touch. The dentist who guided the treatment had received a 2-day training on&#xD;
      internet-based CBT treatment arranged by Psykologpartners AB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CONTROL CONDITION Participants randomized to active control received a hard Michigan-type&#xD;
      stabilization splint placed in the upper jaw by one of two calibrated general dentists&#xD;
      {Ramfjord, 1994 #276}. The splints were made of acrylic, covered all the maxillary teeth and&#xD;
      had a smooth flat surface. Within 2-6 weeks after treatment start, a check-up appointment was&#xD;
      booked. At this check-up appointment, the splint was controlled and, if needed, adjusted.&#xD;
      Participants were also encouraged to continue using it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FOLLOW-UP Follow-up was performed with questionnaires comprising a short version of the&#xD;
      DC/TMD axis II instruments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTCOME MEASURES PRELIMINARY EVALUATION OF PARTICIPANT RESPONSES TO INTERVENTION Measures&#xD;
      specific to TMD included in the DC/TMD were used as outcome measures, as guided by the&#xD;
      Initiative on Methods, Measurement and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials (IMMPACT). Primary&#xD;
      outcomes included characteristic pain intensity, pain-related disability and physical&#xD;
      functioning (CPI, DS and JFLS-8). Secondary outcomes were depression and anxiety as measures&#xD;
      of emotional functioning. In addition to the IMMPACT core domains, catastrophizing and stress&#xD;
      were evaluated as secondary outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FEASIBILITY Evaluation of the feasibility of the study concerned testing the study protocol&#xD;
      and estimation of recruitment and attrition rates in the current research setting. With&#xD;
      preliminary results, a post hoc power and sample size calculation were performed. With&#xD;
      knowledge of recruitment and attrition rate together with a new estimated sample size, a&#xD;
      decision of the feasibility of performing future larger RCT could be taken. The usage metrics&#xD;
      of iMPP were not assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADVERSE EFFECTS Adverse events for iMPP treatment were collected through the follow-up phone&#xD;
      calls. Also, all participants randomized to iMPP were given written information at the&#xD;
      3-month follow-up about the opportunity to withdraw from the study and receive rescue&#xD;
      treatment if symptoms worsened or they were not satisfied with treatment outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL ANALYSIS Non-parametric statistics were used due to the characteristics of the&#xD;
      pain-related variables. Post-hoc power analysis with CPI as the outcome measure was&#xD;
      performed. The sample size required for a parametric test on between-group comparison was&#xD;
      computed and then 15% additional subjects were added since non-parametric testing will be&#xD;
      used in a future RCT {GraphPad Software, 2020 #289}.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Estimation of required sample size was based on a previous neuroimaging study to detect&#xD;
      statistically significant results in functional MRI {Gracely, 2002 #290}. According to this,&#xD;
      20 participants in each group should be recruited.&#xD;
