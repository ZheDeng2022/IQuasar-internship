  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A protocol of ERACS is introduced to our hospital aiming at saving a lot of time and money&#xD;
      for the patients and the population at large .By this way ,free beds for more cases can be&#xD;
      available for others patients, so the researcher is welling to study this research on women&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study aims to assess the level of satisfaction of the women undergoing Enhanced Recovery&#xD;
      Program (ERP) versus conventional care after cesarean section..&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted at the woman's Health University Hospital at obstetrics ward and&#xD;
      postpartum ward of that hospital,at the Assuit&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size for this study will be 300 randomized -controlled trails women and divided&#xD;
      into two groups :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first 150 of women will be enrolled to the control group, receiving conventional care and&#xD;
      the second 150 of women will be recruited to the study group , receiving enhanced recovery&#xD;
      program based care .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization will done by using computer -generated random table.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  After acceptance of eligible women to participate in the study ,they will assigned&#xD;
           randomly to either one of the above groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two tools will be used to collect data of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tool I: perioperative cesarean Section assessment tool:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tool will be developed by the researcher based on reviewing available related literature&#xD;
      and will be used to collect data regarding outcomes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tool will include the following parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1:women's personal data: Consisted of 6 questions such as age, level of education ,&#xD;
      occupation, weight, height, indication for CS ,date ,time of admission and discharge .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: preoperative Data: Consisted of 13 questions such as present medical ,past and&#xD;
      surgical histories, obstetric history ,smoking history , vital signs, investigations, patient&#xD;
      advice and information ,breast feeding education ,discuss NPO status (reduced fasting times&#xD;
      ),hemoglobin optimization ,contact women the day before delivery to review ERAS goals , bowel&#xD;
      preparation, ,medications, time of transfer to theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 3:Intraopreative Data: Consisted of 10 questions such as duration of operation , total&#xD;
      fluid replacement ( including blood transfusion), vital signs ,urine output ,active warming,&#xD;
      delayed cord clamping , skin to skin contact on operation table , minimally invasive surgical&#xD;
      technique, anesthetic and analgesia medication .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 4:Post-operative Data: Consisted of 16 questions such as time of admission to ward, time&#xD;
      of starting oral fluid, time of mobilization , time of remove urinary catheter ,duration of&#xD;
      IV fluid ,use of chewing gum in early postoperative period ,pain intensity , use of analgesia&#xD;
      drug and anibiotics,postoperative complication, pain intensity on discharge ,postoperative&#xD;
      length of stay and reason of delayed postoperative length of stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tool II: Patient's satisfaction tool:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This tool will be developed by researcher based on reviewing related literature including&#xD;
      existing satisfaction tools, tested of validity ,piloted for internal consistency reliability&#xD;
      ,scored and will utilize to assess patient's satisfaction about quality of perioperative care&#xD;
      services. It is six domains and 40 items. Hospital admission procedure domain ( has 4&#xD;
      domains) such as women satisfied about ease of overall ,health care domain (has 10 domains)&#xD;
      such as women satisfied about number of around made of doctor, physician services&#xD;
      ,information provision domain (has 13 domains) such as women satisfied about information of&#xD;
      breast feeding and pain management , ,the personal treatment domain (has 5 domains) such as&#xD;
      women satisfied about kindness of staff , food domain (has 3 domains) such as women satisfied&#xD;
      about served food quality (has 5 domains) such as women satisfied about cleanliness in the&#xD;
      room and hospital facilities .&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Patient's satisfaction will measures by using four points Likert's scale ; Four point&#xD;
      Likert's format that goes from strongly satisfied (4) to strongly dissatisfied (1), which&#xD;
      helps in obtaining an ordinal measure of the strength of the satisfaction with each item. The&#xD;
      tool score range from 40 to 160 .The score of â‰¤ 80 = dissatisfied, the range score &gt; 80- 120&#xD;
      = satisfied , and the range score of &gt; 120 - 160 = very satisfied (Ahmed et.al,2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validity of data collection tools Content validity of the data collection tools will be&#xD;
      established by 5 experts in the field of the study .The necessary modifications will be done&#xD;
      accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pilot study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study will be carried out on the first 10 % of the total sample to test the content&#xD;
      validity, feasibility, clarity and objectively of the tool as well as estimate the time&#xD;
      needed for data collection. Data will analyzed manually following pilot study. According to&#xD;
      the result of pilot study the necessary modifications will be done accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      procedure: An written official approval letter from Faculty of Nursing at the University of&#xD;
      Assuit to the director of Women Health Hospital; this letter will include a brief explanation&#xD;
      of the objective and permission to carry out the study .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data will be collected from control group first and then from study group to prevent sample&#xD;
      contamination. The control group will receive the conventional care while study group will&#xD;
      receive developed enhanced recovery program care .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: Conventional Care Assessment Perioperative data will be collected from this group by&#xD;
      tool I .Every patient will be assessed at a day before operation to gather all preoperative&#xD;
      data .the women's operative report is reviewed by researcher and required information will be&#xD;
      recorded on data collection tool .After that women will be followed up till she is&#xD;
      transferred to postpartum ward where patient will daily be reassessed during morning shift&#xD;
      till patient discharge. The patient's satisfaction will be assessed at discharge using tool&#xD;
      II .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: Designing enhanced recovery program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on reviewing related to literature; enhanced recovery program after cesarean section&#xD;
      will be formulated by a designer team, which will consist of a supervisor and head nurse of&#xD;
      ward, and researcher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The established enhanced recovery pogram will consist of four parts:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part I: Preoperative evaluation and preparation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part will include health history, physical examination, and diagnostic investigation, as&#xD;
      well as pre-operative patient preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II: Postoperative daily intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part will include the daily nursing and collaborative interventions such as assessment,&#xD;
      nutrition, activities, medications, patient and family education, and discharge planning and&#xD;
      instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part III: Expected daily outcome :&#xD;
&#xD;
      This part will include the patient's daily outcomes such as vital signs stability , pain&#xD;
      control ,activities of daily living and mobility improvement; return bowel function, and&#xD;
      meeting discharge criteria .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase three: Implementing enhanced recovery program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The established pathway will implement on the study group by researcher from admission till&#xD;
      discharge as conventional care group assessment in phase one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase four: Evaluating enhanced recovery program outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of enhanced recovery program will be determined by comparing outcomes for&#xD;
      patients of both control and study groups&#xD;
