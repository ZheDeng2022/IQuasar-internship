    <textblock>
      Metastatic or recurrent colorectal cancer patients will be enrolled to evaluate the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and efficacy of YYB101 in combination with irinotecan. In&#xD;
      Phase 1b, YYB101 20 mg/kg in combination with irinotecan 150 mg/m2 will be administered as a&#xD;
      dose level 0, and the safety and pharmacokinetic assessments will be performed based on the&#xD;
      DLT after a 4-week treatment period. If no DLT occurs during the 4-week observation period,&#xD;
      dosing will be continued every 2 weeks until progressive disease (PD) or unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity occurs. After completion of Phase 1b, the SRC will determine the RP2D of YYB101 and&#xD;
      irinotecan, and Phase 2a will be initiated. Stage 2 will proceed when unconfirmed response is&#xD;
      observed in one or more subjects out of 10 subjects evaluable for tumor in Phase 2a Stage 1&#xD;
      which includes the RP2D dose cohort in Phase 1b.&#xD;
