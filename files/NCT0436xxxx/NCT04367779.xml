    <textblock>
      This trial is a paucicentric, clinico-biological cohort study with retrospective and&#xD;
      prospective enrollment, aiming to identify biomarkers predictive of response to Proton Beam&#xD;
      Therapy (PBT) in cancer patients (high grade sarcoma, brain tumors and meningioma). This&#xD;
      study include collection of clinical data, of tumor samples (collected during standard of&#xD;
      care) and a blood sample for alive patients.&#xD;

      The proton beam model policy adopted by the American Society of Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in&#xD;
      2017 supports proton therapy in primary solid neoplasms in children treated with curative&#xD;
      intent. To date, PBT is also recognised in adults as a valid option providing life expectancy&#xD;
      &gt; 10 years, for inoperable axial or head and neck sarcomas, low grade brain tumors (i.e. low&#xD;
      grade astrocytoma, oligodendroglioma and ependymoma), non-operated meningioma of skull base&#xD;
      and other rare clinical situations (re-irradiation, locally aggressive tumor malignant or not&#xD;
      arising in sites which preclude R0 or R1 surgical resection). Recently, Jhaveri et al. have&#xD;
      reported the retrospective analysis of a National Cancer Data Base (NCDB) and shown an&#xD;
      improved overall survival in adult Grade I-IV glioma patients treated with PBT versus&#xD;
      patients treated with radiotherapy (XRT). Positive impact on toxicity free survival and&#xD;
      general health status of patients were reported in others indications. centers join their&#xD;
      expertise (pediatric, brain and sarcoma cancers for Centre Léon Bérard (CLB) and protons for&#xD;
      CAL) and their recruitment to optimize the treatment strategy for these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Centre Leon Bérard recently reported on the ProfilER protocol (NCT01774409). It is the&#xD;
      largest molecular characterization program in France with now over 4000 patients included. It&#xD;
      enabled to identify genomic biomarkers of radio resistance. In this context, the&#xD;
      investigator's proposal is to conduct a genomic, epigenetic, and immunological analysis of&#xD;
      patients treated with proton beam therapy with the aim to identify Biomarkers of response to&#xD;
      PBT in pediatric and adult patients.&#xD;
