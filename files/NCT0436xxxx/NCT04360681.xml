  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposed study is to determine if lofexidine (LFX) as an adjunct&#xD;
      to buprenorphine (BUP) treatment improves symptoms of both opioid use disorder (OUD) and&#xD;
      Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Other study objectives are to compare the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and efficacy of BUP treatment alone, to BUP treatment with adjunct LFX, on&#xD;
      measures of OUD and PTSD symptoms in Veterans with both prognosis .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this clinical trial is to evaluate the efficacy of Lucemyra™ (lofexidine; LFX), an&#xD;
      alpha-2-adrenergic receptor (α2-AR) agonist, as a medication for the prevention of opiate&#xD;
      relapse and the alleviation of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in&#xD;
      opiate-dependent veterans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Endpoints :&#xD;
&#xD;
      For OUD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-Taking Behavior (% abstinent from illicit opioid use from Week 5 to Week 12 of the&#xD;
      active treatment phase) is the primary efficacy endpoint for monitoring the effects of&#xD;
      treatment on OUD, which is measured by both urine drug screen (UDS; opioids are detectable&#xD;
      for 1-4 days) and timeline follow-back (TLFB) interviews of drug/alcohol use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PTSD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary efficacy endpoint for monitoring the effects of treatment on PTSD symptoms is&#xD;
      mean change scores on the PTSD Checklist for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental&#xD;
      Disorders (DSM-5) (PCL-5), which is recommended by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the&#xD;
      Department of Defense (VA/DoD) Clinical Practice Guideline as a quantitative measure of a&#xD;
      patient's PTSD symptoms and response to treatment over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For OUD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Drug-Taking Behavior (≥ 80% abstinent between Week 5 to Week 12), treatment duration (days in&#xD;
      treatment), and scores on the Subjective Opiate Withdrawal Scale (SOWS), the Clinical Opiate&#xD;
      Withdrawal Scale (COWS), and the Opioid Craving Visual Analog Scale (OC-VAS) are secondary&#xD;
      efficacy endpoints for monitoring the effects of treatment on symptoms on OUD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For PTSD:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary efficacy endpoints for monitoring the effects of treatment on core symptoms of&#xD;
      PTSD are CAPS-5 change score (between screening and Week 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      120 veteran participants will be recruited from within the MEDVAMC. The study population will&#xD;
      consist of veterans diagnosed with OUD and potential or provisional PTSD who are seeking&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, single-site, parallel groups,&#xD;
      12-week treatment study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment period of 24 months. Participant duration is 18 weeks (consisting of 4 weeks&#xD;
      screening, a 12-week treatment period, and a 2-week follow-up).&#xD;

    <masking_description>To minimize bias, all participants will be screened for assurance that they meet study eligibility criteria. A placebo drug will be employed as the comparison group to active study drug and the study will be conducted in a double-blinded fashion in that both the participants and the site investigators and staff interacting with participants and assessing study outcomes will be blinded to treatment assignment.

A COWS score of 5 to 12 is considered mild, 13 to 24 is moderate, 25 to 36 is moderately severe, and a score exceeding 36 is considered severe withdrawal. These scales are completed</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male or female, 18 to 65 years of age, capable of reading and understanding English,&#xD;
             and able to provide written informed consent (i.e. no persons who are imprisoned, of&#xD;

             otherwise require a surrogate to provide informed consent).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be on a stable dose of BUP maintenance therapy for at least 7 days at the same&#xD;
             maintenance dose. Veterans who are not currently on a stable dose of BUP maintenance&#xD;
             therapy will be referred to the Substance Dependence Treatment Program at the MEDVAMC&#xD;
             and invited to screen for this study once BUP treatment is stable.&#xD;

             a positive UDS for that substance on study day 1. If a participant both meets DSM-5&#xD;
             criteria for a SUD and has a positive UDS at the screening visit, they will be&#xD;
