    <textblock>
      One of the mechanisms of action of progesterone-only contraceptive pills (minipills) is&#xD;
      increased tubal peristalsis without any scientific documentation. We succeeded to document&#xD;
      visualization of peristalsis of the proximal part of the Fallopian tubes and anatomic tubal&#xD;
      patency as well (Darwish test) via hysteroscopy. This study will test status of proximal&#xD;
      tubal peristalsis in women using minipills.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Progestogen-only pills (POP) prevent pregnancy by thickening the mucus in the cervix to stop&#xD;
      sperm reaching an egg and assumed to increase Fallopian tubal peristalsis so the fertilized&#xD;
      oocyte reaches the endometrial cavity too early for implantation. However, this assumption&#xD;
      has no scientific documentation so far. We succeeded to document visualization of peristalsis&#xD;
      of the proximal part of the Fallopian tubes and anatomic tubal patency as well (Darwish test)&#xD;
      via hysteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of study: to evaluate Darwish test (office hysteroscopic bubble suction test and proximal&#xD;
      tubal peristalsis) in women using minipills.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will include women using any form of minipills (Desogestrel 75 µg, or Norethisterone 350&#xD;
      µg) complaining from abnormal uterine bleeding in the form of menorrhagia, metorrhagia,&#xD;
      intermenstrual spotting or or postcoital bleeding. They will be assigned as group A. Group B&#xD;
      will include women subjected to office hysteroscopy for different indications but not using&#xD;
      any form of hormones or systemic or local hormonal contraception. Preoperative counseling of&#xD;
      all patients followed by an informed written consent taken from those who will agree. The&#xD;
      included patients subjected to complete history taking and meticulous physical examination. A&#xD;
      suspected pregnancy, heavy vaginal bleeding, active pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), severe&#xD;
      co-morbidity, e.g., severe cardiac, neurologic, or chest disease, and other medical&#xD;
      contraindications to pregnancy will be exclusion criteria of this study. Selected cases will&#xD;
      be subjected to office hysteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is based on our previous study on the prevalence of tubal peristalsis&#xD;
      seen via hysteroscopy. If it is supposed that tubal peristalsis would be positive in about&#xD;
      40% of apparently normal FT and it would be positive in about 80% of cases taking minipills,&#xD;
      sample size in each group would be 73 cases in each group. This means 73 or more&#xD;
      measurements/surveys are needed to have a confidence level of 90% that the real value is&#xD;
      within ±5% of the measured/surveyed value ( α error of 0.05 (the real value is within ±5% of&#xD;
      the measured/surveyed value). The vulva, vagina and the thighs will be disinfected with a 10%&#xD;
      povidone-iodine solution. Sterile draping will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office diagnostic hysteroscopy will be performed using a 2.6 mm 30° rigid scope with a 3.2mm&#xD;
      outer sheath (Karl Storz, Tutlingen, Germany). At the beginning in all cases vaginoscopic&#xD;
      approach is tried but if any difficulty will be encountered, grasping of the anterior lip of&#xD;
      cervix with a volsellum will be done. Thereafter, the uterus will be distended with normal&#xD;
      saline at 100-150 mmHg generated from a pneumatic cuff of sphygmomanometer wrapped around the&#xD;
      500-cm3 infusion bottle. As attached to a 250-W Xenon light source, the scope will be&#xD;
      introduced gently through the cervical canal and internal os. To perfectly perform&#xD;
      hysteroscopic Darwish test the following tricks should be followed. Clear view of the&#xD;
      endometrial cavity should be achieved on panoramic view by placing the hysteroscope at&#xD;
      internal os waiting for a while to achieve homogenous distension. The uterine cavity should&#xD;
      be systematically examined starting by its anterior and posterior walls, the fundus, and the&#xD;
      borders. Examination will be considered complete if the both tubal ostia will be reached&#xD;
      describing any gross pathology, e.g., septum, adhesions, polyp(s), myoma, and any growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prerequisites for a successful access to evaluate fallopian tubes via hysteroscopy include&#xD;
      utilization of a 300 telescope with gaining skill of its rotation to reach both cornea and&#xD;
      most importantly orientation with a fundamental anatomic triad (Darwish triad) (DT). The most&#xD;
      proximal corneal fine wide circle is the ostium (the end of the endometrial cavity)&#xD;
      representing a base of a cone which is followed by a shallow conical groove (the first&#xD;
      millimeters of the intramural part of FT). Finally, a distal pinhole dark spot (the narrowest&#xD;
      part of the FT) representing the tip of the cone. Putting DT (ostium, intramural part and&#xD;
      dark spot) in mind is the key step to evaluate tubal patency and physiology via hysteroscopy.&#xD;
      If DT is clearly accessible, the hysteroscopist should comment on this. If there are some&#xD;
      osteal lesions like tiny polyp(s) or fine adhesions that may hinder proper evaluation of the&#xD;
      tubal anatomy and physiology, the hysteroscopist should notice and document. Passage of any&#xD;
      air bubbles in the irrigating fluid towards DT is reported. If no observed air bubbles, the&#xD;
      hysteroscopist should inject just 2 ml of air into the rubber end of the sterile infusion&#xD;
      set. Hysteroscopic bubble suction test is considered positive if air bubbles are sucked by DT&#xD;
      within 1 min. During this period, neither injection of air nor increased pressure will be&#xD;
      done. If no suction of gas bubbles occurred, the examiner should wait for 1 min more to&#xD;
      exclude tubal spasm. Again, if no suction of the bubbles by DT and their accumulation at the&#xD;
      corneal end, the test will be considered negative. Simultaneously, careful visualization of&#xD;
      any change in the shape of the ostium and intramural part of FT particularly during suction&#xD;
      of the air bubbles will be recorded in all cases. Tubal peristalsis is defined as observed&#xD;
      osteal and intramural tubal rhythmic opening and closing on maintained intrauterine pressure,&#xD;
      i.e., periodic changes of DT in the form of widening followed by collapse on meticulous&#xD;
      observation. If the ostium and intramural part of the tube is obviously opened followed by&#xD;
      collapse and non-visualization of the pinhole dark spot of DT for a while, positive&#xD;
      peristalsis will be reported. The same steps will be repeated on the contralateral side and&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
