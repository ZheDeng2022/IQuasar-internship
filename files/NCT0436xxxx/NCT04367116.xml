    <textblock>
      The study is an open-label, prospective, single-arm, unicentral (Huashan Hospital Department&#xD;
      of Neurology/ Neurosurgery) and exploratory clinical trial. Subjects will be enrolled from&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease and Movement Disorder specialized outpatient department of Neurology in&#xD;
      Huashan Hospital and network platform of chronic diseases. Spinal Cord Stimultion (SCS) will&#xD;
      be performed in department of Neurosurgery and cerebral metabolism will be assessed in PET&#xD;
      center of Huashan Hospital. Specialists in Neurology will follow up 3 months to record any&#xD;
      unsafe incidents of progressive supranuclear palsy patients after the SCS surgery to evaluate&#xD;
      safety. Meanwhile, improvement in gait disorder (including 10MWT and TUG test score) will be&#xD;
      measured to evaluate efficacy.&#xD;

      The Study to Evaluate the Safety and Efficacy of Spinal Cord Stimulation on Progressive&#xD;
      Supranuclear Palsy is an open-label, prospective, single-arm, unicentral and exploratory&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the screening stage, patients clinically and radiologically diagnosed as progressive&#xD;
      supranuclear palsy with prominent gait disturbance will be enrolled. Then comprehensive&#xD;
      evaluations and spinal cord stimulation will be performed on patients eligible for&#xD;
      stimulation. In the subsequent process of neuromodulation, changes of clinical presentations&#xD;
      and cerebral metabolism of participants will be assessed. Any unsafe incidents in process&#xD;
      will be recorded in detail.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Clinical diagnosis is Progressive Supranuclear Palsy according to International&#xD;
             Movement Disorder society criteria for Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (2017).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2.18FDG-PET imaging was completed within three months before the operation, and the imaging&#xD;
        results were consistent with characteristics of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy, supporting&#xD;
        the clinical diagnosis of Progressive Supranuclear Palsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The clinical manifestation is prominent gait balance disorder with &quot;freezing gait&quot;,&#xD;
        &quot;turn difficulties&quot; and &quot;feet like a stick on the ground&quot;, &quot;instabillity&quot; and a fall&#xD;
        history in the nearly 6 months (fall number less than or equal to 3 times).Or the&#xD;
        researchers observe the existence of gait balance disorder, but patients can still walk&#xD;

          7. Complicated with severe heart, liver or renal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Clear and definite contraindications for surgery, electrical stimulation and PET&#xD;
             examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Unsuitable for surgery according to evaluation before the surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Other conditions that researchers think unsuitable surgery.&#xD;
