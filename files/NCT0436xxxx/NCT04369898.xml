  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the specificity/sensitivity of the combined presence of cortical&#xD;
      lesions (CLs)/leuco-cortical lesions (LCLs) and central veins sign (CVs) for multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and differential diagnosis.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      CLs and LCLs may be detected at 3 Tesla (T) MRI by using dedicated sequences. 3D Double&#xD;
      inversion recovery (DIR), Phase-Sensitive Inversion Recovery (PSIR), Magnetization Prepared -&#xD;
      RApid Gradient Echo (MPRAGE) and Magnetization Prepared - 2- RApid Gradient Echo (MP2RAGE)&#xD;
      have all shown variable sensitivity to CLs and LCLs. The central vein sign (CVS, i.e. the&#xD;
      detection of a central vessel in a focal lesion) has been recently proposed as a biomarker&#xD;
      for distinguishing between MS and not and not MS. Both the presence of CL and CVs brings high&#xD;
      sensitivity and specificity in distinguishing MS from not MS patients; whether their&#xD;
      combination achieves higher sensitivity and specificity to MS diagnosis and differential&#xD;
      diagnosis is to date not know. This study investigates the specificity/sensitivity of the&#xD;
      combined presence of cortical lesions (CLs)/leuco-cortical lesions (LCLs) and central veins&#xD;
      sign (CVs) for multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis and differential diagnosis.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>Image analysis/ Central vein detection</intervention_name>
    <description>Image analysis/ Central vein detection will be performed using a fully automated approach based on an ensemble of 3D convolutional neural Networks. The method is applied to T1w, T2w and T2*w data . Results will be manually reviewed by 2 experts in CVs detection. MRI data must have been collected at 3 Tesla (3T) between 1990 and 2020 and must include T1 w, T2 w, T2-star based sequence (CVs detection).</description>
