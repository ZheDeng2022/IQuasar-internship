  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      During their studies, the dental students of Brest (France) learn their future profession by&#xD;
      working in the Dental University Hospital, from the fourth academic year. This clinical&#xD;
      activity is considered as both a source of satisfaction and stress by most of the students.&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to investigate the experience of Brest dental students&#xD;
      through a qualitative methodology, with individual interviews, followed by an analysis by&#xD;
      grounded theory (Paillé, 1994).&#xD;

      During their studies, the dental students of Brest (France) learn their future profession by&#xD;
      working in the Dental University Hospital, from the fourth academic year. This clinical&#xD;
      activity is considered as a source of satisfaction by most of the students. They are also&#xD;
      reassured because they know that they will easily find an employment at the end of their&#xD;
      studies. However, the clinical activity can also create a stress among the students, which&#xD;
      varies with their progress in their studies (Polychronopoulou et Divaris, 2009). Other&#xD;
      sources of stress could also be identified. This multifactorial stress can influence their&#xD;
      well-being, their practices and their relationships with patients. The stress and&#xD;
      satisfactions of the dental students have mainly been studied by some questionnaires&#xD;
      (Inquimbert et al., 2017). The main objective of this study is to investigate the experience&#xD;
      of Brest dental students through a qualitative methodology, with individual interviews,&#xD;
      followed by an analysis by grounded theory (Paillé, 1994). This type of research can enable&#xD;
      us to keep a broad approach of students' experience and to stay faithful to it.&#xD;
