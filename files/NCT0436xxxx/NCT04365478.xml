  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hands and wrist spasticity are a common post stroke complication and often lead to&#xD;
      restrictions in daily living activities. Spasticity causes changes in muscle composition such&#xD;
      as accumulation of collagenous connective tissue and progressive loss of skeletal muscle&#xD;
      fibres and these changes start almost immediately after a vascular event. Radial Shock Wave&#xD;
      Therapy (rSWT) is a valid alternative rehabilitating tool in managing chronic spasticity but&#xD;
      no study has so far investigated the effect in a recently onset hemiparesis. The aim of this&#xD;
      study is to evaluate the efficacy of an early radial shock wave therapy in improving&#xD;
      spasticity of the upper limb in patients with a recent onset stroke. The secondary outcome is&#xD;
      to investigate the improvement of upper limb motor functionality, passive range of motion and&#xD;
      joint pain and to determine if it can lead to a better performance in daily living&#xD;
      activities. This study is a randomized controlled trial double arm single blind. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to enrol 40 hemiplegic patients with sub-acute stroke and randomly assign&#xD;
      them to an experimental or control group. The experimental group (EG) will perform one radial&#xD;
      shock wave therapy session a week for 8 weeks administered during the daily morning 40&#xD;
      minutes of conventional rehabilitation treatment. The control group (CG) 40-minutes of&#xD;
      conventional rehabilitation treatment for 5 days per week in the morning for 8 weeks. All&#xD;
      patients performed in the afternoon a second daily session of 40 minutes of conventional&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy 5 days per week. The Modified Ashworth Scale (MAS), Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      Assessment Upper Extremity (FMA-UE) (with motricity, Passive Range of Motion (PROM) and pain&#xD;
      sub-scores of upper extremity part of the scale), Modified Barthel Index and Visual Analogue&#xD;
      Scale (VAS) for patient's benefit perceived, will be evaluated before and a week after the&#xD;
      last intervention. MAS will be administered once a week, before rSWT treatment. The&#xD;
      investigators plan to have a 1 month follow up during which every outcome measure will be&#xD;
      administered. The investigators hypothesize that radial shock waves therapy, started early&#xD;
      and associated with traditional physiotherapy, may be more effective in promoting the&#xD;
      reduction of spasticity and pain of the upper limb, improve its functionality and therefore a&#xD;
      reduction in disability, compared to conventional rehabilitation treatment. A reduction in&#xD;
      the use of analgesic and muscle relaxants drugs is also conceivable&#xD;
