      Introduction: A significant increase in the risk of injury and illness at work has been&#xD;
      associated with fatigue, stress, haste, distraction, emergency situations, excessive noise,&#xD;
      complex procedures and anger among other factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most of these factors are related to the lack of attention to work in progress, which can be&#xD;
      improved by training attention and awareness during daily activities, as it would encourage a&#xD;
      resumption of focus on the task at hand and the possible risks associated with it. . The&#xD;
      primary objective of this project is to evaluate the effects of training to increase&#xD;
      attention and awareness for daily activities - FoCo - outlined for healthcare professionals&#xD;
      in their work schedule. Method: Health professionals from 18 to 60 years of age, of both&#xD;
      sexes, will participate in the study, working in 3 units, one in the care of patients in a&#xD;
      Emergency Care Unit (UPA), in an Elderly Residential and in a Center. Intensive Care (ICU).&#xD;
      In the UPA will be included 25 professionals in group A and 25 in group B; In the Residential&#xD;
      of Elderly, 40 professionals will be included in group A and 40 professionals in group B; In&#xD;
      the ICU will be included 30 professionals in group A and 30 in group B. They will be&#xD;
      randomized in both groups. Group A will receive training in the FoCo program and group B will&#xD;
      be a waiting group. After a period of one month, group B will receive training in FoCo and&#xD;
      group A will be instructed to continue on their own to apply FoCo in their daily lives&#xD;
      (Fig.1). Participants will be evaluated before, after one month and after two months.&#xD;
      Expected Outcomes: After training, an increase in mindful, attention and awareness scale,&#xD;
      self-compassion scale, positive affect, speed of digit and symbol test is expected. It is&#xD;
      also expected to reduce negative affects, perceived stress and an increased perception of&#xD;
      possible incidents.&#xD;
