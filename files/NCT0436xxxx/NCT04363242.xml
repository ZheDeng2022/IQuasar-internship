      A Phase 1 Dose Escalation Trial of SYN125 Single Agent in the Treatment of Solid Tumors and&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Humans have an immune system that can protect and fight infections and abnormal cells.&#xD;
      T-cells are a type of cell produced by the body that can attack and kill cancer cells.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, many cancer cells have ways preventing T-cells from working properly. SYN125&#xD;
      and SYN004 can make T-cells work again. This is a study to find the maximum tolerated dose of&#xD;
      SYN125 when it is used as a single treatment (Part A) for solid tumors, and when it is used&#xD;
      as a combined treatment with a fixed dose of SYN004 (Part B), in patients with epithelial&#xD;
      cancers with EGFR (epithelial growth factor receptor) expressions.&#xD;
