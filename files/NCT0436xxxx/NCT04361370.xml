      This study is phase II, open label, clinical trial to determine the efficacy of Olaparib&#xD;
      maintenance with Bevacizumab and Pembrolizumab by assessment progression-free survival(6&#xD;
      months PFS rate) in BRCA non-mutated patients with platinum-sensitive recurrent ovarian&#xD;

      'This is a Phase II, open-label, non-randomized, multi-center study assessing the efficacy&#xD;
      and safety of Olaparib maintenance with Bevacizumab and Pembrolizumab in subjects with&#xD;
      platinum-sensitive who have received prior of platinum-based chemotherapy. The study will&#xD;
      assess the effectiveness of progression-free survival(6 months PFS rate) as determined by&#xD;
      Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v1.1. The subject will be treated to&#xD;
      until disease progression as below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Maintenance : Olaparib 300mg (twice daily [BID])&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pembrolizumab 200mg every 3 weeks (Q3W) from 2nd infusion for up to 35 infusions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Bevacizumab 15mg/kg or 7.5mg/kg every 3 weeks (Q3W)&#xD;
