  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy of the Lake Effect Zero Degree Knee Splint brace in the&#xD;
      postoperative period of ACL reconstruction to improve range of motion, specifically the&#xD;
      achievement of terminal extension and time-to-achievement compared to the standard hinged&#xD;
      knee brace. This will be directly measured with goniometric angle and heel-height&#xD;
      measurements relative to the contralateral side. Other metrics will include standard,&#xD;
      validated patient reported outcomes and requirements for additional interventions to treat&#xD;
      extension deficits including, but not limited to, additional therapy, intraarticular&#xD;
      injections, oral corticosteroids, manipulation under anesthesia, or arthroscopic arthrolysis.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a prospective randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing&#xD;
      arthroscopic reconstruction of full thickness ACL tears with bone-patellar tendon-bone&#xD;
      autograft. All patients who sign the consent form will be enrolled in the study and&#xD;
      randomized to one of the two treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be appropriately fitted for the brace corresponding to randomization on the day&#xD;
      of surgery. All braces will be placed on the subject in the operating room at the conclusion&#xD;
      of the procedure. All patient will begin a standardized physical therapy protocol on&#xD;
      postoperative day 1-14.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up will take place at standard of care office visits at 1-week, 2-week, 6-weeks,&#xD;
      12-weeks, and 6-months. Range of motion, including goniometric angle and heel-height&#xD;
      measurements, will be recorded at all postoperative time points. Time-to-achievement of full&#xD;
      symmetric extension relative to the non-surgical knee will be monitored and recorded. At 3,&#xD;
      6, and 12 months, patients will also be asked to complete standardized, patient-reported&#xD;
      outcomes questionnaires including IKDC, KOOS, PROMIS, VAS pain, VR/SF 12, and brief&#xD;
      resilience scale. Patients will also be asked to answer questions regarding return to work&#xD;
      and return to sport throughout the 1-year postoperative period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both treatment groups will progress according to standardized, postoperative rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs, similar to the program outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I: Protection, Range of Motion (ROM), and Proprioception&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To protect the surgical graft, restore lower extremity mobility, and proprioception&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient can initiate immediate weight bearing with knee immobilizer brace locked at 0º&#xD;
           extension.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients may unlock or remove brace once they are able to perform a straight leg raise&#xD;
           without any quadriceps lag and perform a single leg stance (SLS) on surgical limb for at&#xD;
           least 30 seconds. Patients must also wear the brace with any weight bearing activity for&#xD;
           six weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for progression to next phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-antalgic gait with no observable gait impairments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ROM: Goal of extension to at least 0º, and flexion within 10º of contralateral knee.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform single leg stance on surgical limb on dynamic surfaces (balance board, foam,&#xD;
           etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises to be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROM:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Flexion: heel slides, wall slides, prone hamstring curls&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Extension: supine or prone hangs, hamstring and calf stretching&#xD;
&#xD;
      NWB strengthening:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Quadriceps sets (prone and supine), leg raises, and bridges on a swiss ball&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proprioception:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • SLS from static to dynamic surfaces and movements, 3-way lunges, balance board, rebounder&#xD;
      or therapist ball tossing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II: Strength and Endurance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Build single limb endurance and to prepare for agility training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • No running/jogging or jumping.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for progression to next phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Full, pain free knee AROM within 3º of contralateral knee&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to perform single leg squat to approximately 60º knee flexion for 2 minutes without&#xD;
           joint pain or compensations&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No compensatory gait patterns during faster ambulation speeds&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises to be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      ROM:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Stretching as needed (calf, hamstring, quad, trunk, upper body)&#xD;
&#xD;
      NWB:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Trunk/core dynamics&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proprioception:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Single leg stance with trunk rotations (use resistance for progression), floor touches,&#xD;
      cone pick-ups on stable and unstable surfaces&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase III: Power and Agility&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Gain type II, fast twitch muscle fibers and prepare for return to sport training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not to be initiated until at least 12 weeks post-operatively&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No uncontrolled jumping (i.e. on grass, when not supervised by medical staff)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No cutting or pivoting at full speeds&#xD;
&#xD;
      Criteria for progression to next phase:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform single leg squat to approximately 60º knee flexion for 3 minutes against&#xD;
           external resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform lateral and diagonal jumping of a distance equal to the patient's leg length or&#xD;
           greater for 2 minutes or longer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform double leg jumps from at least. a 12-inch surface&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Perform single leg static jumps from flat surface&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercises to be included:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leg press, lunge, hamstring curl&#xD;
&#xD;
      Agility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Ladder training, cone drills, lateral and diagonal jumping adding external resistance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase IV: Return to Sport Training&#xD;
&#xD;
      Precautions:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No physical contact during sport specific training&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No live sport performance until cleared by functional sports assessment and surgeon&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo standard of care physical therapy 2-3 times per week for 20 weeks as&#xD;
      directed by their physician. Physical therapy will begin as directed by physician generally&#xD;
      before post op day 14.&#xD;
