  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel group trial to investigate&#xD;
      the safety, tolerability and efficacy of multiple doses of VIT-2763 versus placebo in&#xD;
      participants with non-transfusion-dependent Beta-thalassemia (NTDT).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study includes a 12-week treatment period and a safety follow-up period of 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 36 participants (adults and adolescents) are expected to take part in this study at a&#xD;
      number of different institutions internationally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adult Participants (Cohort I) will be randomized to receive either VIT-2763 once daily (QD)&#xD;
      or twice daily (BID) or placebo, at a dose of 120 mg or 60mg depending on their body weight.&#xD;
      Following cohort I review, adolescent participants (Cohort II) will be randomized to the same&#xD;
      study arms with the same interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study medication will be given as oral capsules, containing 60 mg of VIT-2763 or placebo.&#xD;
