      Our approach will be to implement Virtual Immersive Communication Training on Recommending&#xD;
      Immunizations (VICTORI), an intervention that includes a self-directed app based curriculum&#xD;
      and VR simulations, designed to increase the strength and consistency of HPV vaccine&#xD;
      recommendations among clinicians. A single-site intervention assessing the efficacy of&#xD;
      VICTORI in increasing HPV vaccine rates will be conducted.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite strong evidence the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is effective in preventing&#xD;
      certain anogenital cancers, only 65% of adolescent females and 56% of males in the U.S. have&#xD;
      initiated the series, and only 43% of girls and 31% of boys have completed it.These rates&#xD;
      fall short of Healthy People 2020's objective of 80% coverage for adolescents years of age.&#xD;
      Research has demonstrated that the leading predictor of parents' decisions to vaccinate their&#xD;
      child against HPV is a strong clinician recommendation.However, evidence suggests that many&#xD;
      parents of age-eligible adolescents are not receiving HPV vaccine recommendations or are&#xD;
      receiving weak recommendations from clinicians.Previous interventions aimed at increasing HPV&#xD;
      vaccination rates have had variable effects in part due to reach and adoption of the&#xD;
      interventions within the practices. Also, the diffusion of successful interventions have been&#xD;
      limited by lack of scalable designs.Thus, we will solve this limitation by standardizing the&#xD;
      training component and moving towards developing a scalable model that translates into&#xD;
      consistently improved HPV vaccine rates. Simulation-based medical education (SBME) has become&#xD;
      an essential component of clinical training, demonstrating superior effectiveness in teaching&#xD;
      a wide range of medical skills compared to conventional training methods. Immersive virtual&#xD;
      reality (VR), one type of SBME, is a three-dimensional, computer-generated environment where&#xD;
      users interact with graphical characters called avatars. Within VR, a facilitator can design&#xD;
      scenarios based on specific behavioral objectives and create environments and avatars based&#xD;
      on training needs. The technology facilitates deliberate practice, a personal and&#xD;
      goal-oriented approach to skill development derived from Ericsson's Theory on Expertise. In&#xD;
      our preliminary study conducted in 2015, we developed an intervention for resident physicians&#xD;
      to address influenza vaccine hesitancy, comprised of a self directed application (app) based&#xD;
      curriculum about HPV vaccination followed by immersive VR simulations.Completion of the VR&#xD;
      simulations, compared to receipt of standard training, led to a significantly lower rate of&#xD;
      influenza vaccine refusal.26 Based on these promising preliminary results, we developed VR&#xD;
      simulations focused on HPV vaccine counseling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our approach will be to implement Virtual Immersive Communication Training on Recommending&#xD;
      Immunizations (VICTORI), an intervention that includes a self-directed app based curriculum&#xD;
      and VR simulations, designed to increase the strength and consistency of HPV vaccine&#xD;
      recommendations among clinicians. VICTORI will be implemented using a framework informed by&#xD;
      behavioral (Social Cognitive Theory, Health Belief Model, and Theory of Planned Behavior) and&#xD;
      educational theory (Ericsson's Theory on Expertise). The primary outcome will be an increase&#xD;
      in HPV vaccine rates among adolescent patients. We will also assess theory-based mechanisms&#xD;
      by which the intervention changes vaccination rates, including clinicians' knowledge,&#xD;
      attitudes, perceptions, self-efficacy, and strength of recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our long-term goal is to increase HPV vaccination rates in adolescents, which will decrease&#xD;
      rates of HPV-associated cancers and pre-cancers. Our short-term objective is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy of VICTORI, a novel VR intervention, designed to enhance the strength of clinicians'&#xD;
      HPV vaccine recommendations and improve HPV vaccine rates among 11 to 17-year-old patients.&#xD;
      To accomplish our objective, we will achieve the following specific aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conduct a single-site intervention assessing the efficacy of VICTORI in increasing HPV&#xD;
      vaccine rates. The working hypotheses are: 1) adolescent HPV vaccination rates will increase&#xD;
      significantly following implementation of VICTORI compared to pre-intervention rates and 2)&#xD;
      this increase will be mediated by clinicians' more positive attitudes, higher self-efficacy,&#xD;
      and stronger vaccine recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinician participants will receive a self directed app based curriculum prior to the VR&#xD;
      simulation, VICTORI. Clinicians will receive education to increase their knowledge of HPV and&#xD;
      the vaccine, perceived benefits, positive HPV vaccine attitudes, and subjective norms as well&#xD;
      as decrease their perceived barriers to recommending the vaccine. The participants will&#xD;
      engage in the VR simulations independently. VICTORI VR simulation implementation sessions&#xD;
      will be audio and video recorded. VICTORI's effect will be assessed using a repeated measures&#xD;
      pre-post study design with follow-up period. We will collect monthly baseline data on HPV&#xD;
      vaccine initiation and completion rates in the clinic for six months prior to implementing&#xD;
      VICTORI.We will then collect HPV initiation and completion rates monthly during the time of&#xD;
      intervention implementation and for the following six-months.Next, we will implement VICTORI&#xD;
      with staff including nurses and medical assistants in groups of up to 15-20 participants&#xD;
      (phase II; secondary outcome). Staff will watch a 5-minute video on evidence-based practices&#xD;
      in recommending the HPV vaccine and observe a facilitator and clinician participating in the&#xD;
      VICTORI VR simulations, and then engage in a 5-minute debriefing. Staff will complete a brief&#xD;
      pre and immediate post survey assessing their perceived benefits and barriers, subjective&#xD;
      norms, and positive messaging about the HPV vaccine. We will collect an additional six months&#xD;
      of monthly HPV vaccination initiation and completion data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another clinic will serve as en environmental control.Clinician participants at the control&#xD;
      site will use the self-directed app based curriculum. Participants will complete the repeated&#xD;
      measures pre-post study design with follow-up period. We will collect HPV vaccination data&#xD;
      from the other primary care clinic over the same study period to serve as a control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implications:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be the increase in the proportion of patients receiving HPV&#xD;
      vaccination seen by resident and attending physicians following participation in VICTORI.&#xD;
      Additional secondary outcomes, including physicians' behavioral capability, self-efficacy,&#xD;
      perceived benefits, perceived barriers, perceived risk, attitudes, subjective norms, and&#xD;
      strength of recommendations, as well as staffs' perceived benefits and barriers, subjective&#xD;
      norms, and positive messaging will be assessed via validated survey instruments.&#xD;
