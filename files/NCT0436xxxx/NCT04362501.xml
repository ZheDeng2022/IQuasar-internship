      The overarching objective of this study is to determine the clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      dupilumab for the treatment of CRS that includes several potential disease endotypes with the&#xD;
      exclusion of the nasal polyp cluster that has previously been determined. The additional&#xD;
      information gained from secondary and exploratory outcomes will help provide important&#xD;
      insight for applied research studies and may also provide practical guidance to clinicians on&#xD;
      how to select patients for treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 12% of adults in the United States, United Kingdom and other industrialized&#xD;
      nations suffer from chronic sinus disease. Corticosteroids and antibiotic regimens are often&#xD;
      used to treat the condition but the level of evidence to justify this approach is limited and&#xD;
      at best offers only a transient solution. Furthermore, adverse side effects from the use of&#xD;
      long-term oral steroids and concerns about skewing of the mucosal microbiota from overuse of&#xD;
      antibiotics make these options problematic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there are insufficient options for the approximately 30 million patients in the US&#xD;
      suffering from chronic sinus disease. Recent phase 3 clinical trials found that dupilumab, an&#xD;
      anti-IL4α receptor monoclonal antibody, reduces symptoms and polyp size in individuals with&#xD;
      CRS with nasal polyps (CRSwNP). Similarly anti-IL5 antibodies have also been shown to have&#xD;
      modest efficacy in this group of patients. However, for the approximately 65% of individuals&#xD;
      with non-polyp related chronic sinus disease, these agents were not evaluated and there&#xD;
      remains few viable options for therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic rhinosinusitis is defined as symptoms of nasal obstruction, facial pain or pressure,&#xD;
      and mucopurulent drainage for at least 12 weeks along with evidence of mucosal disease by&#xD;
      radiographic evidence or rhinoscopy. At least ten endotypes have been described although&#xD;
      there is considerable overlap in terms of mucosal morphology, allergic status, the presence&#xD;
      of polypoid tissue, and expression of biomarkers such as cytokines, specific IgE and other&#xD;
      proteins. It may be incorrect to assume that the effectiveness of dupilumab demonstrated for&#xD;
      those suffering with nasal polyps is exclusive to this CRS cluster alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One aspect to explain the differential effects of certain drugs and biologics on the&#xD;
      treatment of CRS relates to host nasal and sinus microbial environment. The microbiome of CRS&#xD;
      patients has been found to have reduced diversity, increased bacterial populations, and&#xD;
      ultimately to have less stable bacterial networks. This imbalance of the microbiome may be a&#xD;
      potential cause for sinus inflammation. Studies have demonstrated that Propionibacterium&#xD;
      acnes for example, acts as an important stabilizing organism in the bacterial networks.&#xD;
      Removal of this bacterial species e.g. from antibiotic use, may allow for more pathogenic&#xD;
      organisms such as Staphylococcus or Streptococcus to flourish leading to increased&#xD;
      inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An example of how Staphylococcus aureus may increase inflammation is through the production&#xD;
      of superantigen that is thought to skew nasal inflammatory responses towards a Th2 dominated&#xD;
      disease endotype. Other groups, have concluded that the host mucosal microbiota helps predict&#xD;
      disease severity and might also predict susceptibility to certain therapies. Indeed,&#xD;
      treatment with certain antibiotics has shown to modulate mucosal bacterial populations&#xD;
      leading to clinical improvement and reduced polyp formation in some patients. It is not known&#xD;
      whether host microbial and inflammatory milieu adequately predicts polyp formation or helps&#xD;
      predict treatment success in the presence of dupilumab. The current study will include&#xD;
      investigation of this important exploratory outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have previously shown that modulation of both the innate and adaptive&#xD;
      immune responses can impact dendritic cell and basophil responses in vitro and that these&#xD;
      changes correlate with treatment success of patients with chronic allergic rhinosinusitis.&#xD;
      The investigators also more recently discovered that IL-4 and IL-13 secreted by human&#xD;
      basophils upregulates CD20 (mannose receptor), CD23 (FcεRII) and pSTAT6 expression on&#xD;
      monocytes, while also promoting CCL17 (TARC) production by these cells. Other investigators&#xD;
      have shown that the mannose receptor on monocytes negatively modulates TLR-4 innate immune&#xD;
      signaling on dendritic cells that in turn affects T-cell polarization and response to&#xD;
      allergens. The investigators might expect dupilumab to help attenuate this pathway resulting&#xD;
      in a reduction of local sIgE production in the mucosa for example. It is already known that&#xD;
      dupilumab reduces the expression of other inflammatory mediators such as CCL17 in asthma and&#xD;
      atopic dermatitis. These aspects will be examined in the exploratory investigations using&#xD;
      cell culture assays, flow cytometry and immunofluorescence pre and post treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overarching objective of this study is to determine the clinical effectiveness of&#xD;
      dupilumab for the treatment of CRS that includes several potential disease endotypes with the&#xD;
      exclusion of the nasal polyp cluster that has previously been determined. The additional&#xD;
      information gained from secondary and exploratory outcomes will help provide important&#xD;
      insight for applied research studies and may also provide practical guidance to clinicians on&#xD;
      how to select patients for treatment.&#xD;
