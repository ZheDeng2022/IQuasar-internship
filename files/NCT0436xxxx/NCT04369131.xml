  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A common therapeutic intervention after spinal cord injury (SCI) is prolonged standing in a&#xD;
      standing frame. For people with SCI, standing for 40 minutes or more, three to four times&#xD;
      weekly improves several health-related issues including well-being, circulation, skin&#xD;
      integrity, reflex activity, bowel and bladder function, digestion, sleep, pain, and fatigue.&#xD;
      However, a person who experiences orthostatic hypotension (OH)-defined as a decrease of 20mm&#xD;
      hg in systolic blood pressure or a decrease of 10mm hg in diastolic pressure within 3 minutes&#xD;
      of standing from a sitting or supine position-secondary to SCI may not tolerate positioning&#xD;
      in a standing frame, thus resulting in a loss of access to these health benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OH is common for people with SCI. It results from central nervous system dysregulation&#xD;
      causing pooling of blood in the lower extremities that can lead to dizziness,&#xD;
      light-headedness, blurred vision, weakness, fatigue, nausea, palpitations, headache, and/or&#xD;
      syncope. Although an array of physical and pharmacologic interventions are available to&#xD;
      people in the general population for managing OH, few such interventions have been evaluated&#xD;
      for use by people with SCI, especially when the level of injury is C5 or above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One possible intervention that may be effective for people with OH secondary to SCI is&#xD;
      functional electrical stimulation (FES) because its application results in a dose-dependent&#xD;
      increase in blood pressure. An unanswered question is whether the placement of FES electrodes&#xD;
      on various parts of the body has differential effects. Therefore, the purpose of this study&#xD;
      is to evaluate blood pressure responses among people with OH secondary to cervical SCI when&#xD;
      receiving FES intervention involving the placement of electrodes in three different positions&#xD;
      as well as when receiving no FES intervention during tilt table sessions. The selected&#xD;
      positions for electrode placement are: (a) the calves, (b) the quads and abdominals, and (c)&#xD;
      the quads, abdominals, and calves. The researchers hypothesize that FES intervention,&#xD;
      regardless of placement, will result in better control of OH than no FES intervention and&#xD;
      that no significant blood pressure difference will occur across the three FES placements.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants will engage in three initial heads-up tilt table sessions with no FES&#xD;
      intervention to confirm the presence and consistency of OH. During these sessions, the&#xD;
      participant will lie supine on a tilt table at 0°, and, using a blood pressure cuff secured&#xD;
      around the arm, the researchers will measure and record supine blood pressure. The&#xD;
      researchers will then adjust the tilt table to 30° for three minutes and take and record&#xD;
      another blood pressure measurement. If the participant reports no OH symptoms and the&#xD;
      researchers observe no changes in appearance or signs of distress at that time, the&#xD;
      researchers will query the participant about willingness to adjust the table to an additional&#xD;
      10° of tilt. Following three minutes at this level, the researchers will again measure and&#xD;
      record the participant's blood pressure. These procedures will continue with increments of&#xD;
      10° of increased tilt every three minutes to a maximum of 90° tilt until the session time&#xD;
      (maximum of 60 minutes) has elapsed or the participant expresses discomfort, measured blood&#xD;
      pressure drops relative to the supine recording, or the researchers observe behaviors&#xD;
      indicative of OH (e.g., sweating, change in skin color, change in breathing pattern,&#xD;
      grimacing). If any of these OH symptoms occur, the researchers will adjust the tilt table to&#xD;
      lower levels of incline until the participant's blood pressure stabilizes to the supine&#xD;
      position measurement, and the session will be terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention sessions will begin after three days of baseline measurements. Intervention&#xD;
      sessions will follow the same procedures except that the conditions will alternate randomly&#xD;
      among the three FES placement and the no FES conditions. All sessions will be held at Quality&#xD;
      Living, Inc., in Omaha, Nebraska.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>Participants will engage in three baseline sessions to document blood pressure fluctuations associated with central nervous system dysregulation when changing from a sitting or supine position to a standing position involving the use of a head-up tilt table and no FES. Then, participants will engage in tilt table sessions in which the researchers randomly alternate the placement of FES pads across four conditions: (a) no FES, (b) calves only FES, (c) quads and abdominal only FES, and (d) calves, quads, and abdominal FES. Sessions will occur three to four times weekly until a participant demonstrates no OH upon tilt table adjustment to 90° (i.e., upright position) or the participant discharges from Quality Living, Inc., whichever comes first.</intervention_model_description>
