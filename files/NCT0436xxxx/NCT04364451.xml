    <textblock>
      Haematological malignancies constitute the most common neoplastic disease in child&#xD;
      population, with acute leukemia occupying the number one spot with a percentage of 32.8%. In&#xD;
      children, leukaemia is primarily encountered in its acute form (97%) and in the majority of&#xD;
      the cases it is presented as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - ALL (80%). Acute&#xD;
      Non-Lymphoblastic Leukemia - ANLL is encountered less frequently (17%) and it includes Acute&#xD;
      Myelogenous Leukaemia - AML (15%) and some other rare forms (2%), while the remainder 3%&#xD;
      corresponds to chronic leukaemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      L-Asparaginase (L-ASP) is a fundamental component during the loading phase with regards to&#xD;
      achieving remission of the disease and, likewise, during the maintenance phase with the&#xD;
      intention of establishing that remission in both children and adults suffering from ALL. The&#xD;
      cytotoxic effect of the exogenous administration of Asparaginase is caused by the depletion&#xD;
      of the reserve of asparagine in the blood. Asparaginase (ASP) acts as a catalyst for the&#xD;
      hydrolysis of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. Asparagine is vital for protein and&#xD;
      cell synthesis and, therefore, for their survival. The normal cells of the human body have&#xD;
      the ability to produce asparagine from aspartic acid, with the assistance of the enzyme&#xD;
      asparagine synthetase. However, the neoplastic cells either lack the enzyme completely or&#xD;
      contain minute amounts of it resulting in their inability to synthesize asparagine de novo.&#xD;
      The survival of these cells and their ability to synthesize proteins depends entirely on&#xD;
      receiving asparagine from the blood. Thus, the administration of ASP leads to the inhibition&#xD;
      of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis which, in turn, results in the apoptosis of these cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite L-ASP's paramount importance in the chemotherapy treatment of leukaemia, it is&#xD;
      responsible for a plethora of toxic adverse effects that sometimes even require the&#xD;
      termination of its administration. A critical adverse event of ASP is a disorder in the&#xD;
      metabolism of lipids. Specifically, it appears that the activation of the endogenous pathway&#xD;
      that produces triglycerides through hepatic synthesis leads to hypertriglyceridaemia. The&#xD;
      liver is capable of synthesizing VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoproteins) that are rich in&#xD;
      triglycerides. Utilising the effect of the enzyme Lipoprotein Lipase (LpL), located on the&#xD;
      vascular endothelium, the triglycerides detach from the VLDL causing the latter to transform&#xD;
      into IDL (Intermediate Density Lipoproteins) and afterwards into LDL (Low Density&#xD;
      Lipoproteins). The triglycerides are later extracted from the blood circulatory system and&#xD;
      stored in the adipose tissue, while the LDL particles connect with tissue receptors or&#xD;
      macrophage receptors. The final products of the breakdown (coming from the peripheral&#xD;
      hydrolysis of triglycerides with the help of LpL) of chylomicrons, VLDL, the remnants of&#xD;
      lipoproteins, will eventually be removed by hepatic receptors. Apolipoprotein E (Apo-E) plays&#xD;
      an important role in this procedure, it binds these remnants in the presence of LpL and&#xD;
      hepatic lipase. Along the duration of the treatment with ASP, reduced LpL functionality is&#xD;
      recorded, resulting in impaired plasma clearance of triglycerides and an increase in their&#xD;
      levels, while L-ASP appears to cause disorders in other lipid factors, such as cholesterol,&#xD;
      HDL and apolipoprotein A. Disorders of lipid metabolism have been found to be associated with&#xD;
      polymorphisms of the LpL and Apo-E genes, sometimes with positive and sometimes with negative&#xD;
      effects on the lipid profile and more likely participation in cardiovascular complications.&#xD;
      The current study will evaluate, the lipid profile of children with ALL, the effect of L-ASP&#xD;
      on the lipid profile of the aforementioned patients, as well as the correlation between the&#xD;
      polymorphisms of Lipoprotein Lipase (LpL) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) with the values of the&#xD;
      lipids during chemotherapy. Both the universal and national bibliography that pertain to the&#xD;
      effect of ASP on the potency of LpL and App E and to the values of the lipids in children&#xD;
      that suffer from ALL during chemotherapy with L-ASP is limited, while there exists no&#xD;
      bibliographic reference correlating the genetic background to LpL and Apo E and the relation&#xD;
      of the lipid profile. The current study will examine for the first time gene polymorphisms of&#xD;
      LpL and Apo E in children with ALL during treatment with ASP.&#xD;

      Introduction&#xD;
&#xD;
      Malignancies during childhood constitute the 2nd cause of death, following injuries&#xD;
      worldwide. According to epidemiological data, 300,000 new cases of neoplasia present&#xD;
      themselves every year in children and teenagers under 19 years of age1, 160,000 of which&#xD;
      concern children under the age of 15. Haematological malignancies constitute the most common&#xD;
      neoplastic disease in child population, with acute leukemia occupying the number one spot&#xD;
      with a percentage of 32.8%, followed by central nervous system tumors with a percentage of&#xD;
      21% on the second spot and lymphoma with a percentage of 12% on the third spot.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition - Pathophysiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Leukaemia (L) is defined as a group of perturbations characterized by uncontrolled&#xD;
      proliferation of white blood cells, due to the bone marrow's primary divergence from normal&#xD;
      and the its infiltration by immature undifferentiated stem cells. By definition, more than&#xD;
      20% of the bone marrow is infiltrated by stem cells. Leukaemia's exact pathogenic mechanism&#xD;
      has not been clarified as of yet, it appears, however, to be the result of genetic mutation&#xD;
      and damage to the multipotential haematopoietic ancestral cells, during one of their distinct&#xD;
      stages of differentiation. This fact leads to clonal expansion and inhibition of&#xD;
      differentiation. The leukaemic cell's immunophenotype reflects the level of differentiation&#xD;
      achieved by the neoplastic clone. The leukaemic cells divide at a slower pace and require&#xD;
      additional time to synthesize DNA compared to normal haematopoietic cells causing anaemia,&#xD;
      thrombocytopenia and neutropenia. At the time of the diagnosis, the leukaemic cells could&#xD;
      have, not only replaced the normal cells of the marrow but also expanded into extra-medullary&#xD;
      areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The various types of leukaemia are exceptionally heterogeneous and, depending on the cells'&#xD;
      origin, they are differentiated into lymphoblastic and non-lymphoblastic leukemias. Each one&#xD;
      of the above mentioned subgroups can be encountered in its Acute Leukaemia (AL) or Chronic&#xD;
      Leukaemia (CL) form. In the acute form, the immature cells of the haematopoietic tissue are&#xD;
      dominant and the progression of the disease without any treatment leads quickly to death. In&#xD;
      the chronic forms, the mature cells dominate the tissue and the development of the disease,&#xD;
      generally, takes longer. In children, leukaemia is primarily encountered in its acute form&#xD;
      (97%) and in the majority of the cases it is presented as Acute Lymphoblastic Leukaemia (ALL,&#xD;
      80%). Acute Non-Lymphoblastic Leukaemia - ANLL is encountered less frequently (17%) and it&#xD;
      includes Acute Myelogenous Leukaemia - AML (15%) and some other rare forms (2%), while the&#xD;
      remainder 3% corresponds to chronic leukaemia. AL occurs more often between the ages of 2 and&#xD;
      6 years old while the incidence is higher in boys compared to girls (1:1.3). 2.5% - 5% of&#xD;
      children's ALL and 6% - 14% of children's AML is encountered in infants under 1 year old. The&#xD;
      characteristic type of ALL is the B-cell ALL, which is additionally the most common in&#xD;
      children (85%) compared to the T-cell ALL (15%) which is accompanied by masses in the lymph&#xD;
      nodes of the mediastinum amongst other areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Epidemiology&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the United States of America (USA) and most of the countries of Western Europe, the&#xD;
      frequency of leukaemia in children is 3.5 - 4.0 cases per 100,000 childhood population yearly&#xD;
      and it is ranked as the 20th cause of death among malignancies of all ages. It is deduced&#xD;
      from large-scale cohort studies that the incidence of childhood cancer in developed countries&#xD;
      is rising 1% every year. The prevalence of ALL in children was detected for the first time in&#xD;
      the 1930s in the United Kingdom (UK) and the USA. In the USA, ALL appeared first in children&#xD;
      of European descent, and afterwards, in children of African descent in the 1960s. The&#xD;
      frequency of ALL is lower in developing and underdeveloped countries, a fact that hints at a&#xD;
      possible correlation between industrialization and leukaemogenesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asparaginase (ASP)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The chemotherapy combination treatments used today to treat ALL have improved significantly&#xD;
      the long-term course of the disease with the overall five-year-survival rate exceeding 80%,&#xD;
      while the respective ratio in the 1960s was under 30%. One of the main reasons that&#xD;
      contributed to this development is the intensive, extended and higher dosed administration of&#xD;
      Asparaginase. L-Asparaginase (L-ASP) is a fundamental component during the loading dose with&#xD;
      regards to achieving remission of the disease and, likewise, during the maintenance dose with&#xD;
      the intention of establishing that remission in both children and adults suffering from ALL.&#xD;
      The cytotoxic effect of the exogenous administration of asparaginase is caused by the&#xD;
      depletion of the reserve of asparagine in the blood. Asparaginase acts as a catalyst for the&#xD;
      hydrolysis of asparagine to aspartic acid and ammonia. Asparagine is vital for protein and&#xD;
      cell synthesis and, therefore, for their survival. The normal cells of the human body have&#xD;
      the ability to produce asparagine from aspartic acid, with the assistance of the enzyme&#xD;
      asparagine synthetase. However, the neoplastic cells either lack the enzyme completely or&#xD;
      contain minute amounts of it resulting in their inability to synthesize asparagine de novo.&#xD;
      The survival of these cells and their ability to synthesize proteins depends entirely on&#xD;
      receiving asparagine from the blood. Thus, the administration of asparaginase leads to the&#xD;
      inhibition of DNA, RNA and protein synthesis which, in turn, results in the apoptosis of&#xD;
      these cells. The low levels of asparagine only affect the survivability of the cancer cells,&#xD;
      leaving the healthy cells undisturbed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ability of L-ASP to suppress the proliferation of the leukaemic cells was first observed&#xD;
      in clinical studies during the 1970s, and from that moment on it has remained the cornerstone&#xD;
      of childhood ALL treatment. The natural forms of the enzyme, produced by the bacteria Erwinia&#xD;
      chrysanthemi and Escherichia coli (E.Coli), are being used for treatment, much like L-ASP's&#xD;
      product created from the conjugation of E. Coli. with polyethylene glycol&#xD;
      (Pegylated-Asparaginase, PEG-ASP) with prolonged half-life of 5.5 days instead of the 26 hour&#xD;
      half-life of the natural forms. Chemotherapy protocols for ALL recommend a dosage of 1,000 -&#xD;
      2,500 IU/m2 of PEG-ASP and 5,000 - 12,000 IU/m2 of the natural form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adverse Reactions of Asparaginase&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite L-ASP's paramount importance in the chemotherapy treatment of leukaemia, it is&#xD;
      responsible for a plethora of toxic adverse effects that sometimes even require the&#xD;
      termination of its administration. Studies have shown that the omission of administration of&#xD;
      doses due to the emergence of toxic adverse effects in previous administrations is linked to&#xD;
      poor prognoses in children with ALL. The most common adverse effects are hypersensitivity&#xD;
      reactions, as studies indicate their rate occurrence is as high as 75%. The ASP that is being&#xD;
      utilized is a large molecule of bacterial origin (mainly E. Coli) and thus is able to induce&#xD;
      an immune response which grows more intense after repeated exposure and, mainly, after a&#xD;
      delay of the drug administration. Aside from the clinical hypersensitivity reactions that&#xD;
      signal an immediate response from the attending medical staff, there also exist subclinical&#xD;
      reactions that can lead to a decrease in the potency of the drug that is difficult to detect&#xD;
      in order to act swiftly. Pancreatitis is reported at a rate as high as 18% of the patients&#xD;
      with ALL during treatment with ASP. The pathogenic mechanism is not yet known, however it&#xD;
      appears that the fault lies with the decrease of protein synthesis from organs with&#xD;
      significant protein turnover, like the pancreas. Moreover, it is considered that this&#xD;
      mechanism is also responsible for the hepatotoxicity detected during treatment with&#xD;
      asparaginase. Additionally, the ASP induced decrease in protein synthesis is involved in the&#xD;
      processes of coagulation and fibrinolysis which in turn leads to thrombotic episodes of the&#xD;
      central nervous system and deep vein thrombosis of the extremities. Other adverse reactions&#xD;
      are hyperglycaemia, as a result of decreased insulin production and myelosuppression, mainly&#xD;
      due to enhancing the suppression effect of the other chemotherapy drugs. Furthermore, there&#xD;
      have been reports of incidents of encephalopathy during therapy with ASP that could be&#xD;
      related with the elevated levels of ammonia that result from the breakdown of ASP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A critical adverse event of ASP that could result in additional complications if it is not&#xD;
      promptly identified is a disorder in the metabolism of lipids. Specifically, it appears that&#xD;
      the activation of the endogenous pathway that produces triglycerides through hepatic&#xD;
      synthesis leads to hypertriglyceridaemia. Some studies indicate that the rate of high values&#xD;
      of triglycerides is 67% 8 - 14 days after administering the medicine. The liver is capable of&#xD;
      synthesizing VLDL (Very Low Density Lipoproteins) that are rich in triglycerides. Utilizing&#xD;
      the effect of the enzyme Lipoprotein Lipase (LpL), located on the vascular endothelium, the&#xD;
      triglycerides detach from the VLDL causing the latter to transform into IDL (Intermediate&#xD;
      Density Lipoproteins) and afterwards into LDL (Low Density Lipoproteins). The triglycerides&#xD;
      are later extracted from the blood circulatory system and stored in the adipose tissue, while&#xD;
      the LDL particles connect with tissue receptors or macrophage receptors. The final products&#xD;
      of the breakdown (coming from the peripheral hydrolysis of triglycerides with the help of&#xD;
      LpL) of chylomicrons, VLDL, the remnants of lipoproteins, will eventually be removed by&#xD;
      hepatic receptors. Apolipoprotein E (apo-E) plays an important role in this procedure, it&#xD;
      binds these remnants in the presence of LpL and hepatic lipase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lipoprotein Lipase (LpL)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The LpL gene is located on the chromosome 8p22 and is comprised of 10 exons. There have been&#xD;
      recorded roughly 100 mutations, with 3 of them being the most common, 2 of which are&#xD;
      connected with reduced functionality of LpL and increased cardiovascular risk. The mutation&#xD;
      known as polymorphism N291S is present in 2-5% of the general population and its existence is&#xD;
      associated with decreased functionality of LpL and an imbalance in the VLDL metabolism&#xD;
      [increase of triglycerides, decrease of HDL (High Density Lipoproteins)]. In addition, it&#xD;
      appears that the effect of this mutation is amplified by the coexistence of other genetic&#xD;
      factors (familial hypercholesterolaemia, apolipoprotein E2/E2). The second mutation, known as&#xD;
      polymorphism D9N, is related to increased risk of atherosclerosis, even if the mutation&#xD;
      causes a light decrease in the functionality of LpL. As of late, it was observed that the&#xD;
      combination of small nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) on the genes of Apo E and of LpL&#xD;
      denominate a high-risk group for cardiovascular disease. Lastly, the third mutation,&#xD;
      encountered in the 20% of the general population, polymorphism S447X is linked with slightly&#xD;
      elevated HDL levels and low levels of triglycerides and thus has a positive impact on the&#xD;
      lipid profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Along the duration of the treatment with ASP, reduced LpL functionality is recorded, likely&#xD;
      caused by the altogether reduced protein synthesis from the liver, as is apparent from the&#xD;
      decreased concentrations of other proteins, such as albumin and fibrinogen. Studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated, in particular, that the suppression of the LpL's effects is connected with an&#xD;
      increase in the ratio of ApoCIII/ApoCII, where ApoCII is an essential cofactor of LpL and it&#xD;
      promotes the hydrolysis of triglycerides and ApoCIII acts as an inhibitor of LpL while&#xD;
      simultaneously appears to be able to regulate the levels of triglycerides in the serum&#xD;
      independently from LpL. Hence, a problem is created in the triglyceride cleansing from the&#xD;
      plasma as their levels rise. Another suggested mechanism for the high levels of triglycerides&#xD;
      during treatment with asparaginase is the increase in VLDL synthesis, which is also reflected&#xD;
      in the high apolipoprotein ApoB100 concentration, a component of VLDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Apolipoprotein E (Apo E)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gene of Apo E is situated on chromosome 19 and it is comprised of 4 exons. Apolipoprotein&#xD;
      E (Apo E) is one of the structural components included in lipoproteins, which are rich in&#xD;
      triglycerides, and it plays an important role in the hepatic protein intake. Apolipoprotein E&#xD;
      (Apo E) has 3 alleles ε2, ε3, ε4 [APOE-ε2 (cys112, cys158), APOE-ε3 (cys112, arg158) and&#xD;
      APOE-ε4 (arg112, arg158)]. ε3 is the most common in the general population and it contains&#xD;
      cysteine at position 112 and arginine at position 158. ε4 differs from ε3 at position 112,&#xD;
      where instead of it substitutes the cysteine for arginine55. The isomorph ε2 has a weaker&#xD;
      connection with the lipoprotein receptors of the liver which results in the accumulation of&#xD;
      remnants from chylomicrons and VLDLs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ApoE4 attaches to the lipoprotein receptors in the liver in vitro having the same affinity as&#xD;
      ApoE3, however the effect of ApoE4 in the cleansing of lipoproteins rich in triglycerides in&#xD;
      vivo is undefined as of yet. The ε2 allele is connected with higher triglyceride levels after&#xD;
      fasting, while the ε4 allele is connected with hypercholesterolaemia and high LDL&#xD;
      cholesterol. The individuals with the genotype E3/E4 display slower cleansing of lipoproteins&#xD;
      rich in triglycerides in comparison with individuals with the genotype E3/E3. The ε4 allele&#xD;
      looks to be associated with an affected triglyceride metabolism. The individuals with the ε2&#xD;
      allele have lower cholesterol levels compared to the individuals with ε3 and ε4 alleles.&#xD;
      Studies indicate, further, that individuals with genotype E2/E4 have higher triglyceride&#xD;
      levels after fasting in relation to the individuals with genotype E3/E3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alterations in the ApoE gene lead to changes in the amino acids of the coded protein, which&#xD;
      results in a modified structure of the normal protein. The latter results in a slower&#xD;
      cleansing of lipoproteins rich in triglycerides. In one study, it was revealed that there was&#xD;
      a higher prevalence of the phenotype E4/E3 in patients with hypertriglyceridaemia compared to&#xD;
      patients with normal triglyceride levels. Additionally, no significant statistical difference&#xD;
      was observed between triglyceride levels and the phenotypes of ApoE after treatment with&#xD;
      asparaginase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asparaginase and Lipid Profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the effect of asparaginase on cholesterol levels, the studies do not allow to&#xD;
      reach any reliable conclusion, as some studies found an increase in a small percentage of the&#xD;
      patients after administering the medicine, others indicated a significant increase, while&#xD;
      others yet presented a small but not significant decrease. Regarding the HDL levels, studies&#xD;
      have discovered that they are lower in children suffering from malignancies, specifically of&#xD;
      a haematological type. Another study focusing on children with ALL, during and after&#xD;
      treatment with ASP the HDL levels rose with a simultaneous drop Apo-A1 levels. HDL plays a&#xD;
      crucial role in the process of reverse transfer of cholesterol from the peripheral tissue to&#xD;
      the liver, a mechanism that imparts on HDL the properties of an anticoagulant agent.&#xD;
      Functioning in tandem with the aforementioned properties, other parts of HDL have&#xD;
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-apoptotic and anticoagulant properties that contribute&#xD;
      to safeguarding against atherogenesis. Lipoprotein Apo-A1 comprises the main structural&#xD;
      protein for HDL. It is apparent that asparaginase as an inhibitory factor of protein&#xD;
      synthesis could possibly modify the ratio of lipids/ proteins in favor of the first on the&#xD;
      molecules of HDL. Low HDL and Apo-A1 levels have been noticed even in free of disease&#xD;
      survivors of ALL after the end of treatment. This observation is of particular importance if&#xD;
      one thinks about the danger of atheromatosis and coronary disease due to low levels of HDL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertriglyceridaemia is able to become the sole contributor to the development of acute&#xD;
      pancreatitis. When the levels of triglycerides rise above 900 mg/dl they form chylomicrons,&#xD;
      molecules big enough in size that they can obstruct the pancreatic capillaries leading to&#xD;
      ischaemia and release of pancreatic lipase. The latter will reinforce the lipolysis with an&#xD;
      increase of free fatty acids which will, in turn, allow the release of free radicals and&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory derivatives causing, in the end, inflammation and necrosis. As seen above,&#xD;
      asparaginase is capable of taking part in the pathogenesis of pancreatitis through two&#xD;
      routes, an independent and a dependent upon triglycerides. Hypertriglyceridaemia could also&#xD;
      promote a predisposition for thrombosis in patients suffering from ALL and who are under&#xD;
      treatment with ASP, as on one hand, the medicine is connected to modifications of the&#xD;
      fibrinolytic system, as was already mentioned, meanwhile on the other hand the increase of&#xD;
      triglycerides causes hyper-viscosity of the blood raising the risk of thromboembolic&#xD;
      complications. Drawing from the cases documented in the universal bibliography, it is made&#xD;
      clear that the majority of the thromboses involves the central nervous system (CNS), while on&#xD;
      second place are cases of deep vein thrombosis of the upper extremities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lastly, it is significant to add that administration of ASP to children with haematological&#xD;
      malignancies in multiple phases of the treatment is co-administrated with corticosteroids,&#xD;
      either prednisone or dexamethasone. It can be easily perceived that corticosteroids can&#xD;
      synergize and intensify the adverse events, such as hyperlipidaemia, pancreatitis and&#xD;
      thrombosis. Furthermore, asparaginase can contribute to some adverse events of the&#xD;
      corticosteroids, such as osteonecrosis through the hyper-coagulant state that it creates.&#xD;
      Since both of these medications are pivotal therapeutic factors, a very close and attentive&#xD;
      monitoring of the patient's condition and emergence of adverse events is required in order to&#xD;
      intervene if necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originality&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both the universal and national bibliography that pertain to the effect of asparaginase on&#xD;
      the potency of LpL and Apo E and to the values of the lipids in children that suffer from ALL&#xD;
      during chemotherapy with ASP is limited, while there exists no bibliographic reference&#xD;
      correlating the genetic background to LpL and Apo E and the relation of the lipid profile.&#xD;
      The current study will examine for the first time gene polymorphisms of LpL and Apo E in&#xD;
      children with acute ALL during treatment with ASP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Importance&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this particular study investigators will focus on researching the lipid profile of&#xD;
      children with ALL, on the effect of ASP on the lipid profile of these patients, as well the&#xD;
      correlation between the polymorphisms of lipoprotein lipase (LpL) and Apolipoprotein E (ApoE)&#xD;
      with the values of lipids for the duration of the chemotherapeutic protocol. The hypothesis&#xD;
      that is going to be tested is whether recording the genotypes of the under-study children&#xD;
      with ALL will be able to constitute a preemptive indicative factor for the outcome of their&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this manner, vital conclusions will be extracted for the probable contribution of&#xD;
      genotypes of children that are being administered L-ASP to the laboratory demonstration of&#xD;
      lipid disorders during treatment, the closer supervision during the corresponding phases of&#xD;
      treatment and the timely therapeutic intervention in order to prevent any complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methodology&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Type: Prospective case-control study The characterization epidemiologic study is in&#xD;
      complete accord with the aim of our study, a study of the effect of ASP on the lipid profile&#xD;
      of children and adolescents with ALL (Patient Group) as well as the correlation of the&#xD;
      polymorphisms of LpL and ApoE with the lipid levels duration of the chemotherapeutic&#xD;
      protocol. The existence of two additional children groups that will act as population-control&#xD;
      (children and adolescents of the same age group that do not manifest the disease and&#xD;
      participants of the similar ages that have manifested the disease and have completed&#xD;
      chemotherapy as per protocol for at least 6 months prior) specialises our study type into a&#xD;
      case-control study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site: The study will be conducted in the Paediatric and Adolescent Haematology -&#xD;
      Oncology Unit of the 2nd Department of Paediatrics, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki&#xD;
      (AUTH), at University General Hospital AHEPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Description of the recorded parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the disease's diagnosis, the lipid profile of the patients' will be determined by&#xD;
      measuring the following parameters: total cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL-cholesterol,&#xD;
      LDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, apolipoprotein B100, lipoprotein α [Lp(α)], glucose,&#xD;
      Serum Glutamic Oxaloacetic Transaminase (SGOT), Serum Glutamic Pyruvic Transaminase&#xD;
      (SGPT),Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone (TSH), Free Thyroxine (FT4), amylase, lipase.&#xD;
      Additionally, a genetic analysis for polymorphisms of LpL and Apo E will be conducted.&#xD;
      Similar measurements will be done to all participants of all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants of group A will be immediately subjected to the chemotherapy protocol ALLIC&#xD;
      BFM 2009. During the loading dose, these children will receive treatment with prednisolone&#xD;
      for 33 consecutive days and asparaginase will be added on days 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30,&#xD;
      33. During the maintenance phase the children will be subjected anew to treatment with&#xD;
      corticosteroids, dexamethasone, and asparaginase will be added on days 8, 11, 16, 18. The&#xD;
      lipid identity will be checked before administration of ASP on day 0 and 11 as well as after&#xD;
      the administration of ASP and before the administration of the next dose at the loading dose,&#xD;
      meaning days 15, 24, 33. Similarly, the lipid identity will be checked on the maintenance&#xD;
      phase, meaning on days 8, 16, 21 as well as after the end of every phase of chemotherapy&#xD;
      protocol in which ASP is not administered.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, an examination of LpL polymorphisms (the three most common polymorphisms p.N291S,&#xD;
      p.D9N, p.S447X) and of Apo E polymorphisms [ε2(rs7412-T,rs429358-T), ε3(rs7412-C, rs429358-T)&#xD;
      and ε4 (rs7412-C, rs429358-C)] will be performed after isolating the DNA from the peripheral&#xD;
      blood and analyzing it with molecular techniques.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants that meet all the inclusion criteria for this study will be examined and undergo&#xD;
      treatment with ASP (Patient group) and will be compared to the corresponding teams of healthy&#xD;
      children and children that have ailed and are off chemotherapy for at least 6 months&#xD;
      (Controls group).&#xD;
