    <textblock>
      This study is being done to test a transplant method that may have fewer side effects (or&#xD;
      less toxic, less harmful) than conventional high dose chemotherapy conditioning-based&#xD;
      transplants for children and young adults with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). Patients less than&#xD;
      or equal to 25 years old with SCD who would likely benefit from allogeneic hematopoietic cell&#xD;
      transplantation (HCT) will be included in this study. Patients with a suitable HLA matched&#xD;
      sibling donor (MSD) will be enrolled on the MSD arm while patients without an eligible MSD&#xD;
      who have a suitable haploidentical (HAPLO) donor available will be enrolled on the HAPLO arm&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess the donor T-cell chimerism at 1-year post transplant in each respective arm (MSD,&#xD;
      HAPLO) of the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the overall survival and 1-year, 2-year and 3-year post-transplant graft versus&#xD;
           host disease (GVHD)-free SCD-free survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the primary and secondary graft rejection rate at 1-year, 2-year and 3-year&#xD;
           post- transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the incidence and severity of acute and chronic (GVHD).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the incidence of SCD recurrence after transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the neutrophil and platelet recovery kinetics post-transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Record immune reconstitution parameters, including chimerism analysis, quantitative&#xD;
           lymphocyte subsets, T cell receptor excision circle (TREC) analysis, V-beta&#xD;
           spectratyping, and lymphocyte phenotype and function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Conduct longitudinal examination of impact of HCT on patient health-related quality of&#xD;
           life (HRQL) and adjustment, and parental adjustment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Examine impact of HCT on patient cognitive and academic function.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine factors that influenced the decision to undergo HCT, explore perceptions of&#xD;
           the HCT experience, and assess decisional satisfaction/regret.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and evaluate an objective/quantitative imaging biomarker to assess organ (liver&#xD;
           and heart) function/disease status and changes following HCT.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Develop and evaluate an objective/quantitative imaging biomarker to determine cerebral&#xD;
           blood flow and oxygen extraction fraction following HCT.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a prospective single center phase II study of a reduced intensity conditioning based&#xD;
      hematopoietic cell transplant for patients with sickle cell disease. In this study, patients&#xD;
      with SCD who would be expected to benefit from an allogeneic HCT will receive an&#xD;
      unmanipulated peripheral blood derived hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) graft&#xD;
      from either an MSD or HAPLO donor after a reduced intensity conditioning regimen comprising&#xD;
      of alemtuzumab, thiotepa and low dose total body irradiation. All patients will receive a&#xD;
      pre-conditioning phase comprising of hydroxyurea and azathioprine to reduce the risk of graft&#xD;
      rejection. GVHD prophylaxis will consist of sirolimus. Patients on the HAPLO arm will also&#xD;
      receive two doses of post-transplant cyclophosphamide. All patients will receive regularly&#xD;
      scheduled low dose donor lymphocyte infusions till donor lymphocyte chimerism reaches at&#xD;
      least 90% donor. The main objective of this study is to improve graft function and immune&#xD;
      reconstitution after a reduced intensity conditioning based transplant.&#xD;
