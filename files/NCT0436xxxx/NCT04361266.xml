  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to assess Rotium, a novel nanoscaffold, impact on healing of a repaired&#xD;
      rotator cuff and compare to a repair without Rotium. Animal (sheep) models have shown both&#xD;
      quicker and more organized healing when Rotium is used, but there are no studies to confirm&#xD;
      these outcomes translate to human population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Rotium rotator cuff repairs will heal both quicker and better than traditional&#xD;
      rotator cuff repair techniques.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients indicated for rotator cuff repair surgery will be offered participation within the&#xD;
      study and consented accordingly. A copy of the consent will be provided to the participant. A&#xD;
      preoperative ultrasonographic assessment will occur by Dr. Onishi. A randomization process by&#xD;
      computer program will determine patients who have Rotium augmented repairs, or not. The&#xD;
      patients will not be blinded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The surgery will be carried out by a single surgeon making all aspects uniform, except if&#xD;
      there is or is not a Rotium patch. The Rotium patch will be implanted in accordance to&#xD;
      standards of handling sterile implants and placed in a manner that is consistent to its FDA&#xD;
      approval. The patch will be furnished by the institution where the surgery is being&#xD;
      performed. Digital photography will document pertinent arthroscopic operative findings per&#xD;
      standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant assessment will commence preoperatively in an outpatient clinic then continue in&#xD;
      postoperative period, occurring at 2, 4, 6 weeks and 3, 6 and 12 month intervals. During each&#xD;
      visit, the participants will be assessed by two clinicians: the principal investigator and a&#xD;
      blinded ultrasonographer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative assessment will include obtaining baseline patient reported outcomes (UCLA,&#xD;
      Rowe, Constant, American Shoulder and Elbow Surgeons (ASES) score and SANE (Single Alpha&#xD;
      Numeric Evaluation)scores) by paper questionnaire. A medical history will document NSAID use,&#xD;
      cortisone injections about the shoulder, tobacco usage, narcotic medicine consumption, and&#xD;
      pregnancy status. Due to their deleterious effects on healing, all patients will be&#xD;
      instructed to not take NSAIDs in the first 6 weeks postoperative. Noncompliance will be&#xD;
      noted, but not disqualify the participant from study. Smoking cessation will be strongly&#xD;
      encouraged. A shoulder physical examination will be performed; specifically range of motion&#xD;
      assessment in multiple planes (frontal flexion, internal and external rotation at 90 degrees&#xD;
      of abduction and at side), rotator cuff muscle strength testing with the scapula stabilized,&#xD;
      scapula posture observed, and provocative tests for impingement syndrome. Medical records&#xD;
      will be reviewed. This evaluation will be performed by the principal investigator and will&#xD;
      take 45-60 minutes. The participant will undergo a separate diagnostic ultrasonographic&#xD;
      assessment of the rotator cuff tendons by blinded ultrasonographer. This will take 15-30&#xD;
      minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aftercare of each population will be identical and will include a 6-week period of sling&#xD;
      immobilization, brief perioperative narcotic medicine, and physical therapy. Physical therapy&#xD;
      protocols will be identical. The participants will be treated by a variety of physical&#xD;
      therapists. All physical therapy will occur out of the home at a PT clinic. Additional home&#xD;
      exercises will be furnished and will be independently performed by the participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, at the 2-week postoperative visit a history will be obtained to quantify&#xD;
      narcotic usage, NSAID usage, VAS pain score, and assess for any complications. The surgical&#xD;
      site and sling will be inspected, passive range of motion of the shoulder assessed (frontal&#xD;
      flexion and external rotation at the side), and the examine will exclude any complications.&#xD;
      Physical therapy for shoulder passive range of motion and periscapular strengthening will be&#xD;
      prescribed, home exercise sheet provided, and the abduction portion of the sling will be&#xD;
      discontinued. Shoulder radiographs will be performed. This visit will take 15-30 minutes. In&#xD;
      addition and separate to this,blinded ultrasonographer will perform ultrasound assessment of&#xD;
      the repaired rotator cuff. Vascularity using superb microvascular imaging and standard&#xD;
      ultrasound techniques will assess vascularity and rotator cuff repair integrity. If possible,&#xD;
      elastography will be performed. These images will be stored in de-identified manner within&#xD;
      University of Pittsburgh HIPPA-compliant cloud. This will take 15-30 minutes and may be done&#xD;
      at a separate time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 4-week postoperative visit a history will be obtained to quantify narcotic usage,&#xD;
      NSAID usage, pain score, and assess for any complications. The surgical site and sling will&#xD;
      be inspected, passive range of motion of the shoulder (frontal flexion and external rotation&#xD;
      at the side) assessed, and the examine will exclude any complications. The prior physical&#xD;
      therapy and home exercises will be continued. This visit will take 15-30 minutes. In addition&#xD;
      and separate to this, blinded ultrasonographer will perform ultrasound assessment of the&#xD;
      repaired rotator cuff. This will take 15-30 minutes and may be done at a separate time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 6-week postoperative visit a history will be obtained to quantify narcotic usage,&#xD;
      NSAID usage, pain score, and assess for any complications. The surgical site and sling will&#xD;
      be inspected, passive range of motion of the shoulder (frontal flexion, internal and external&#xD;
      rotation at 90 degrees of abduction and at side) assessed, and the examine will exclude any&#xD;
      complications. The sling will be discontinued and new physical therapy and home exercises&#xD;
      will be provided; therapy will include shoulder passive range of motion and periscapular&#xD;
      strengthening and include rotator cuff strengthening progressing from isometric to concentric&#xD;
      then to eccentric with the pace being determined by a physical therapist, but done in a pain&#xD;
      free manner. Additionally, patient reported outcomes (UCLA, Rowe, Constant, ASES and SANE&#xD;
      scores) will be collected. This visit will take 30-45 minutes. In addition and separate to&#xD;
      this, blinded ultrasonographer will perform ultrasound assessment of the repaired rotator&#xD;
      cuff. This will take 15-30 minutes and may be done at a separate time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the 3-, 6- and 12-month postoperative visits a history will be obtained to assess shoulder&#xD;
      functionality/limitations, quantify NSAID usage, pain score, and assess for any&#xD;
      complications. The examination will be similar to the 6-week evaluation, except rotator cuff&#xD;
      specific strength will be assessed similar to the preoperative testing. Necessity of ongoing&#xD;
      physical therapy will be considered and ordered appropriately. Home exercises will be&#xD;
      continued. These visits will take 30-45 minutes. In addition and separate to this, blinded&#xD;
      ultrasonographer will perform ultrasound assessment of the repaired rotator cuff. This will&#xD;
      take 15-30 minutes and may be done at a separate time.&#xD;
