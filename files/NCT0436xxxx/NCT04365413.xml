  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and potential of a new experimental&#xD;
      imaging instrument called multispectral optoacoustic tomography (MSOT) to detect tumors and&#xD;
      lymph nodes with tumors.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will involve patients that are scheduled for routine standard of care surgery. It&#xD;
      is a single-arm study designed to provide safety information regarding the use of the Acuity&#xD;
      MSOT device in the clinical setting, and the ability of MSOT imaging data to correlate with&#xD;
      clinical findings identified via pathology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The device will be used to obtain images of the tumor or lymph node margins for&#xD;
      investigational use only to compare to clinical pathology and patient's medical record. All&#xD;
      images will be obtained pre- and post-surgery in a closed surgical patient. The temperature&#xD;
      of the patient's skin will also be measured prior to and after MSOT imaging. MSOT imaging&#xD;
      will be for research only and no treatment decisions will be based on the MSOT images&#xD;
      obtained.&#xD;

    <description>Adverse events as characterized by CTCAE v5.0 in patients that may result from MSOT imaging (≥44 degrees Celsius)&#xD;
Measurement of skin temperature pre- and post-MSOT imaging (2 measurements total) with a touch thermometer as part of the safety evaluation of the MSOT device. The thermometer will be placed onto the skin until a temperature appears, about 1 minute, and the temperature will be recorded.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Detection of Residual Tumor after Surgery</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>Percent residual tumor after resection based on MSOT imaging will be calculated. Tumor positivity based on signal detection using MSOT will be correlated with that obtained from standard clinical laboratory techniques.&#xD;
Medical record review will occur up to 6 months to allow for follow-up pathology assessments to be gathered and provide information to allow for analyses to be performed.</description>
