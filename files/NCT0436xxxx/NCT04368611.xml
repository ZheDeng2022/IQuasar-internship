      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the usual approach in dealing with cholithiasis that greatly&#xD;
      replace open approach even in acute emergency gall bladder diseases. Laparoscopic approach&#xD;
      has great advantages than open approach but the biliary injuries are higher in laparoscopic&#xD;
      approach than open approach. Laparoscopic approach is condemned for many years in&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary risk patients because of its adverse impacts on cardiopulmonary systems.&#xD;
      Performing laparoscopic cholecystectomy with low pressure pneumoperitoneum may be effective&#xD;
      in treatment of acute gall bladder disease but with fundus first approach than classical&#xD;
      Calot first approach.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: compare between initial Fundus first cholecystectomy followed by Calot dissection VS&#xD;
      Calot only cholecystectomy in Emergency laparoscopic cholecystectomy with low pressure&#xD;
      pneumo-peritoneum in cardiopulmonary risk patients as regard intraoperative data and&#xD;
      postoperative complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study prospective randomized controlled study was conducted on 470 cases with acute&#xD;
      cholecystitis, biliary colic, mucocele and pyocele of gall bladder in emergency general&#xD;
      surgery department. Patients were divided into 2 groups, Group A: fundus first group&#xD;
      (235cases) and Group B (235cases): classical Calot first approach.&#xD;

      1. INTRODUCTION Introduction of laparoscopy in management of cholithiasis gave a great push&#xD;
           to dealing with this disease. The advancement of laparoscopic cholecystectomy had&#xD;
           greatly evolved in the last years making laparoscopic cholecystectomy is the commonest&#xD;
           operation performed within field of gastrointestinal tract surgery and almost replaced&#xD;
           open cholecystectomy.[1] [2]&#xD;
&#xD;
           After introduction of laparoscopic cholecystectomy, many advantages the patients gained&#xD;
           over open cholecystectomy as small operative wounds with minimal postoperative pain and&#xD;
           infection and hence rapid discharge from hospital. Other advantages are better cosmosis,&#xD;
           earlier resumption of oral feeding and rapid restoration of daily activity and work. [3]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Although laparoscopic cholecystectomy had many advantages over open approach yet, many&#xD;
           disadvantages emerged after the wide spread use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy as&#xD;
           higher incidence of bile duct injuries that may reach 0.3-0.8% that may increase in&#xD;
           acute emergent cases. This is a grave problem that may cause mortality to the patients.&#xD;
           [4]Strasberg gave us the best solution up till now and the way to avoid injury to&#xD;
           biliary tract. [5].Other complications the patients may face after laparoscopic&#xD;
           cholecystectomy are organ injury; vascular injury and obstructive jaundice from missed&#xD;
           stone in common bile duct during the operation. [6]&#xD;
&#xD;
           About 30% of patients undergo laparoscopic cholecystectomy are elderly patients with&#xD;
           cardiopulmonary risks [7]&#xD;
&#xD;
           Co2 insufflation into the peritoneal cavity exerts bad effects on cardiac and&#xD;
           respiratory systems and may worsen the condition of cardio-pulmonary risk patients.&#xD;
           Pneumo-peritoneum with CO2 causes splintage of the diaphragm, hypercarbia with&#xD;
           arrhythmias, compression of main abdominal vasculature (Inferior Vena Cava and abdominal&#xD;
           aorta) and stretch of the peritoneal cavity with consequent parasympathetic irritation&#xD;
           causing baradycardia.[8][9][10][11][12].&#xD;
&#xD;
           Head up position during laparoscopic cholecystectomy exerts good effect on lung but bad&#xD;
           effects on heart as it decreases venous return and hence cardiac output. Also, the head&#xD;
           up position increases adrenaline level in the blood that lead to vasoconstriction of&#xD;
           blood vessels that increase peripheral resistance and decrease cardiac output and&#xD;
           increases load on myocardium.[13][14] [15]&#xD;
&#xD;
           No randomized studies have compared fundus first laparoscopic cholecystectomy with low&#xD;
           pressure pneumoperitoneum with Calot first dissection cholecystectomy in cardiopulmonary&#xD;
           risk patients with urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the outcome of urgent LC using either&#xD;
           fundus first approach or Calot classic approach in cardiopulmonary risk patients as&#xD;
           regard morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. THE AIM OF THE WORK The aim of this study was to evaluate and compare the outcome of&#xD;
           urgent laparoscopic cholecystectomy under low pressure Pneumo-peritoneum using either&#xD;
           fundus first approach and Calot classic approach in cardiopulmonary risk patients as&#xD;
           regard morbidity and mortality.&#xD;

&#xD;
        1. Full clinical examination: pain in right hypochondrium radiated to right shoulder, local&#xD;
           examination revealed tenderness in right hypochondrium or mass and fever.&#xD;
&#xD;

      pneumoperitoneum and initial fundus first cholecystectomy followed by dissection of Calot&#xD;
      triangle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group B (n=235): patients underwent laparoscopic cholecystectomy with low pressure&#xD;
      pneumoperitoneum and Calot first cholecystectomy from the start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efforts to decrease bias in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. For pretrial bias: Good Define objectives. Risk and outcome .Select patients on&#xD;
           probability sample with adequate sample size. Define confound factors and avoid it&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To avoid during trial bias: Standardize reaction and management of patients&#xD;
           blindly-Objective data use rather than subjective-Good handling of data- plan designed&#xD;
           for drop out&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To avoid after trial bias: Suitable statistical analysis used-Good and carefully&#xD;
           interpretation-Control of confound&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients were given general anesthesia. Nasogastric and urinary bladder catheters were&#xD;
      inserted to ensure the stomach and bladder were empty. Through the periumbilical incision, A&#xD;
      Hasson technique was used and a trocar is introduced to the abdomen under vision.&#xD;
      Pneumoperitoneum was created 8-10 mm Hg. The camera was introduced and the abdominal cavity&#xD;
      inspected. A 10 mm trocar was placed at the level of epigastrium 5 cm below xiphoid process.&#xD;
      A third 5 mm trocar was placed just below the right subcostal margin. 4th trocar is inserted&#xD;
      at the level of umbilicus at anterior axillary line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fundus first approach initial approach: we start dissection of the peritoneum at the side of&#xD;
      gall bladder and perform dissection in inverted U shaped incision in the peritoneum covering&#xD;
      the side and fundus of gall bladder then the gall bladder is dissected free from gall bladder&#xD;
      bed .then the fundus of gall bladder is retracted towards easily to the right shoulder and&#xD;
      start exposure and dissection of the Calot triangle .in this way, dissection of Calot&#xD;
      triangle became very easy. Sometimes aspiration of the gall bladder contents helped us to&#xD;
      grasp the fundus.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Calot triangle first dissection: we started dissection at gall bladder neck. Adhesions to&#xD;
      omentum, colon, duodenum or stomach are pulled away by blunt and diathermy dissection.&#xD;
      Dissection continued very close to gall bladder wall. Identification of Calot triangle helped&#xD;
      us to recognize the anatomy. Cystic duct and cystic artery are dissected free and clipped and&#xD;
      divided. Then the gall bladder is dissected free from the liver. The gallbladder bed was&#xD;
      inspected for hemostasis which was achieved by coagulation. The gallbladder was removed from&#xD;
      the abdomen through the epigastric port. Irrigation and suction of the bed was performed and&#xD;
      a drain is put in gall bladder bed. Under vision, all ports were removed. The umbilical&#xD;
      incision was closed in layers with Vicryl No 1 and subcuticular with prolene three zero.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Mortality (90-day mortality and mortality at maximal follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Postoperative complications: early (hemorrhage, bile leak, wound infection) and late&#xD;
           complications (biliary stricture)&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Port site hernia Secondary outcomes&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Conversion to open cholecystectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Total hospital stay.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Intra-operative findings (duration of operation, intra-operative bleeding and iatrogenic&#xD;
           injuries)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Return to work.&#xD;
