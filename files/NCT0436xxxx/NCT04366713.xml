    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, phase 2 study that will investigate colon pathology in patients with&#xD;
      HER2-positive breast cancer treated with neratinib as monotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive neratinib for the first 28 days as a single daily dose of 240 mg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy will be performed after eligibility has been confirmed, but prior to&#xD;
      administration of the first dose of neratinib and at Day 30 (± 3 days) the conclusion of&#xD;
      Cycle 1 (28 days).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the second study colonoscopy procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients being treated for stage 1 to 3c breast cancer in the extended adjuvant&#xD;
           setting, neratinib will continue to be administered at a single daily dose of 240 mg&#xD;
           until completion of one year of therapy from start of treatment, or until disease&#xD;
           recurrence (as determined by the Investigator), death, unacceptable toxicity, or other&#xD;
           specified withdrawal criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For patients being treated for metastatic breast cancer (mBC), capecitabine will be&#xD;
           introduced after the second study colonoscopy procedure at a dose of 750mg/m2 twice&#xD;
           daily for 14 days of each 21 day treatment cycle, with neratinib administered&#xD;
           continuously throughout at 240 mg daily, until disease progression, death, unacceptable&#xD;
           toxicity, or other specified withdrawal criterion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients will receive loperamide diarrhea prophylaxis daily for one 28-day cycle and then&#xD;
      as needed.&#xD;
