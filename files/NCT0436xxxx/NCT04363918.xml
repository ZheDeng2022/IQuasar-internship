    <textblock>
      Erectile dysfunction (ED), as defined by the International Consultation on Sexual Medicine,&#xD;
      is the consistent and recurrent inability to acquire or sustain an erection of sufficient&#xD;
      rigidity and duration to engage in satisfactory sexual intercourse. In the search for other&#xD;
      approaches to treat ED the use of bioelectrical stimulation (BES) has been successfully&#xD;
      introduced and applied in clinical studies. In the search for other approaches to treat ED&#xD;
      the use of bioelectrical stimulation (BES) has been successfully introduced and applied in&#xD;
      clinical studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The investigators randomized 30 male patients, aged 40 to 75 years, with known ED (defined as&#xD;
      a score of less than 22 on the IIEF-5), who had been in a stable relationship for more than 6&#xD;
      months and not taking any ED medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were randomly assigned to three groups: intervention (IG1), intervention&#xD;
      (MyoStim group) or control (CG). The IG1 received FES therapy (50 Hz/500 μs) for a total of 4&#xD;
      weeks, divided into two weekly sessions lasting 15 minutes each, with intensity set lower&#xD;
      than the motor threshold that was assessed individually. The MyoStim group received a&#xD;
      combination of low frequency BES and microcurrente for a total of 4 weeks, divided in two&#xD;
      weekly sessions lasting 45 minutes each with intensity set lower than the motor threshold&#xD;
      that was assessed individually which was delivered via two patch electrodes placed on the&#xD;
      dorsum surface of the penis and connected to a desk top Mettler model 240 Bioelectric&#xD;
      Stimulator, which was adjusted to reach each of the signals included in the protocol. In all&#xD;
      three groups two self-adhesive electrodes measuring 3 cm each were used. One electrode was&#xD;
      placed at the base of the penis, while the second was attached 2 cm below the first one. The&#xD;
      control group was treated with placebo FES machine (the red light functioning but there was&#xD;
      no power). Both groups attended sessions twice a week for a period of 4 weeks, for a total of&#xD;
      8 FES sessions. Erectile function was assessed by the validated International Index of&#xD;
      Erectile Function (IIEF-5) and Erection Hardness Score (EHS) instruments. All of the&#xD;
      questionnaires were applied before and immediately after the treatment. The instruments were&#xD;
      completed by a blinded investigator, according to the protocol to which the patient had been&#xD;
      randomized. Only the physiotherapist who applied the technique was aware of group allocation.&#xD;
      Participants had no treatment costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The IG1 received actual stimulation for only the VEGF signal during the each treatment&#xD;
      period, while the multi-signal MyoStim group received actual stimulation at precise&#xD;
      frequencies for the five proteins which were changed every 5-15 minutes including.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects completed all 8 treatments and the study questionnaires and metrics of ED before&#xD;
      and at the end of the study. The study was unblinded when the last enrolled patient had&#xD;
      completed their 4 weeks of treatment. The study included an opportunity for all patients&#xD;
      randomized to the Control group to then receive the full four-week, 8 session treatment, for&#xD;
      whichever of the two active treatment arms, VEGF alone or Myostim, was shown to be most&#xD;
      effective. MyoStim treatment was clearly superior to the other treatment arms and all ten&#xD;
      Control subjects elected to complete the full 4-week treatment with the MyoStim protocol in&#xD;
      an open-label cross-over design. These ten subjects were then added to the original cohort&#xD;
      assigned to MyoStim, for a total of 20 patients in the MyoStim arm. The statistical analysis&#xD;
      was completed for the original treatment assignments with 10 subjects in each group and the&#xD;
      total of 20 MyoStim subjects versus VEGF alone or Control.&#xD;
