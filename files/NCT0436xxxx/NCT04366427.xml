  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, Hyperbaric Oxigen (HBO) is a widely used treatment for several conditions. There&#xD;
      are 14 indications for HBO, officially recognized by the Undersea and Hyperbaric Medical&#xD;
      Society (UHMS), but research is discovering other interesting applications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBO plays an important role in enhancing antioxidant defense mechanisms by increasing radical&#xD;
      oxygen species (ROS) and nitric oxide species (NOS). This controlled oxidative stress has&#xD;
      been shown to stop the vicious circle of inflammation - damage - hypoxia already seen in&#xD;
      several diseases. Increased neoangiogenesis has been demonstrated at pressures of 2&#xD;
      atmospheres absolute (ATA), while effects helping ischemic tissues need pressures between 2.5&#xD;
      and 2.8 ATA to develop. Also, stem cell proliferation and mobilization have been demonstrated&#xD;
      after HBO treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During sports activities, metabolism generates waste products - mostly CO2, lactic acid, but&#xD;
      also ROS. HBO could be useful in modulating antioxidant mechanisms and increasing stem cell&#xD;
      mobilization, thus helping cells in the recovery after training and sportive competitions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors hypothesize that:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. HBO can reduce oxidative stress and induce stem cell mobilization in healthy&#xD;
           professional athletes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. hyperoxic mixtures can reduce oxidative stress and induce stem cells mobilization in&#xD;
           healthy professional athletes;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. HBO at low pressures (L-HBO at 1.45 ATA) is at least comparable to conventional HBO (at&#xD;
           2.5 ATA) in reducing oxidative stress and increasing stem cell mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Authors will include healthy athletes. These will be randomly assigned to a control&#xD;
      group, a L-HBO group, a HBO group, a 30% O2 group, or a 50% O2 group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Authors will assess oxidative stress changes and stem cells proliferation before and&#xD;
      after 20 L-HBO/HBO/30% O2 mix/50% O2 mix treatments, and after 2 months after the end of&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will be recruited through public announcements in local gyms and gathered to explain&#xD;
      the protocol. Those willing to participate will sign a written informed consent and&#xD;
      recruited. To be included, all the subjects will undergo a general medical screening to allow&#xD;
      hyperbaric treatments. This will include weight, height, non-invasive arterial blood&#xD;
      pressure, and heart rate measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After inclusion, subjects will be randomly assigned to three arms using an electronic number&#xD;
      generator by personnel not directly involved in the experiment:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 1(control): no intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 2 (L-HBO): treated with oxygen at 1.45 ATA for 60 min (inclusive of compression and&#xD;
           decompression times, and an air break of 3 minutes breathing air);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 3 (HBO): treated with oxygen at 2.5 ATA for 60 min (inclusive of compression and&#xD;
           decompression times, and an air break of 3 minutes breathing air).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 4 (30% O2): breathing an air mixture with 30% of oxygen at atmospheric pressure (1&#xD;
           ATA).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm 5 (50% O2): breathing an air mixture with 50% of oxygen at atmospheric pressure (1&#xD;
           ATA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects included in Arm 2, 3, 4, 5 will undergo a total of 20 treatments. They will follow a&#xD;
      personalized diet proportional to their energetic expenditure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Authors will identify 3 time-points in the protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      TIME 0 (T0): immediately after inclusion, before any treatment or experiment; TIME 1 (T1): at&#xD;
      the end of HBO treatments; TIME 2 (T2): 2 months after the end of HBO treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following exams will be performed on the included subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  a standardized panel including Complete Blood Count (CBC), creatinine, Blood Urea&#xD;
           Nitrogen (BUN), C reactive protein, and VES will be performed at T0, T1, and T2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  oxidative stress markers will be analyzed on blood, urine, and saliva samples. On blood&#xD;
           samples (T0; T1; T2), the Authors will measure IL-1 beta, IL-6, TNF-alfa, reactive&#xD;
           oxygen species and total antioxidant capacity (by paramagnetic resonance), total (tot)&#xD;
           and reduced (red) aminothiols (by fluorescence spectroscopy), 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) (by&#xD;
           competitive immunoassay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On urine samples (T0; T1; T2), the Authors will assess lipid peroxidation by measuring&#xD;
      8-isoprostane concentration (by competitive immunoassay), nitrite and nitrate (NO2/NO3)&#xD;
      concentration (by colorimetry based on the Griess reaction), inducible Nitric Oxide Synthase&#xD;
      (by ELISA commercially available kit), creatinine, neopterine, and uric acid concentrations,&#xD;
      8-oh-2-deoxyguanosine (by competitive immunoassay).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On saliva samples (T0; T1; T2) the Authors will measure reactive oxygen species and total&#xD;
      antioxidant capacity (by paramagnetic resonance), and cortisol (by competitive immunoassay).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  stem cells will be analyzed on blood samples (at T0, T1, T2) (by flow cytometry).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples (approximately 6-12 ml) will be drawn from the veins of the forearms&#xD;
      (preferentially on the non-dominant limb); plasma and erythrocytes will be separated by&#xD;
      centrifuge at 1000×g for 10 min at 4°C. Urine samples will be collected by voluntary voiding&#xD;
      in sterile containers. 1 mL of saliva will be obtained by Salivette devices (Sarstedt,&#xD;
      Nümbrecht, Germany). The subjects will be instructed to refrain from drinking, eating,&#xD;
      smoking, brushing their teeth, and using mouthwash in the 30 min before salivary collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All samples will be stored in multiple aliquots at - 80 °C until assayed and thawed only once&#xD;
      before analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this setting, blinding of patients and investigators will be impossible due to different&#xD;
      structural characteristics. However, outcome assessors will be blinded to patients'&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
