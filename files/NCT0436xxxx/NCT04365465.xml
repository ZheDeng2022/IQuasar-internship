  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, placebo controlled and natural-history controlled trial to investigate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of NSS-2 BRIDGEÂ® for postpartum women with AND without opioid use disorder&#xD;
      (OUD). The purpose of this pilot investigation is to establish feasibility/acceptability of&#xD;
      the trial design.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study is a randomized control trial with the following arms: 1) active device; 2)&#xD;
      placebo device; 3) non-intervention (active control). The devices will be placed while women&#xD;
      are still feeling pain relief from labor epidural analgesia (after delivering vaginally) or&#xD;
      from spinal or epidural anesthesia (after delivering by cesarean). By applying the devices&#xD;
      while women are still relatively pain-free, a preventative/pre-emptive approach to pain&#xD;
      management in women at risk for severe postpartum pain is taken. The study will enroll women&#xD;
      with and without OUD and follow them for five days postpartum.&#xD;
