  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is increasing in the population, and is associated&#xD;
      with heart disease and diabetes. At present there are no licensed drugs for treatment of&#xD;
      NAFLD, therefore changes in diet and increased physical activity leading to decreased body&#xD;
      fatness is the recommended management/treatment strategy. However, these are difficult to&#xD;
      achieve and maintain for many individuals. A potential compound gaining interest in regards&#xD;
      the treatment/prevention of NAFLD is sulforaphane, which is found in vegetables such as&#xD;
      Broccoli. Animal studies suggest supplementing with sulforaphane can increase fat oxidation.&#xD;
      This increased &quot;fat burning&quot; may result in lower levels of fat in the liver and overall in&#xD;
      the body.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will ask participants to undertake an intervention phase which will involve&#xD;
      consuming two sulforaphane tablets a day for approximately 3 weeks. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to maintain all other aspects of their lifestyle throughout the intervention phase. The&#xD;
      researchers will measure and compare participants whole-body and liver fat oxidation in&#xD;
      response to a standardised test meal before and after the intervention phase by taking blood&#xD;
      and breath samples. The researchers will also measure the amount of fat in participants liver&#xD;
      and heart using a non-invasive technique known as magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS)&#xD;
      before and after the intervention.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants satisfying the inclusion criteria will be invited to the Oxford Centre for&#xD;
      Clinical Magnetic Resonance Research (OCMR), to measure the amount of fat within their liver&#xD;
      and heart using magnetic resonance imaging and spectroscopy (MRI/S). Then on a separate day,&#xD;
      within one week of having their liver and heart fat content measured, participants will come&#xD;
      into the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) at the Oxford Centre for Diabetes Endocrinology and&#xD;
      Metabolism (OCDEM) for a 'postprandial study day' after an overnight fast. Participants will&#xD;
      be asked to avoid excessive exercise and alcohol for 24 hours prior to the study. The day&#xD;
      prior to and over the course of the 'study day' participants will be asked to drink some&#xD;
      'heavy water' ((2H2O) CK Isotopes Limited). The amount of 'heavy water' a volunteer will have&#xD;
      to consume is 3g heavy water per kg body water, which will achieve a plasma water enrichment&#xD;
      of 0.3%. Once participants arrive at OCDEM the researchers will make some anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements (e.g. weight, height, waist circumference etc.), collect a urine sample, and&#xD;
      place a small plastic tube (cannula) into a vein on the forearm, from which they will take&#xD;
      blood samples. A second cannula will also be placed into a large vein in the elbow crease of&#xD;
      the opposite arm. Sequential blood samples will be collected by the researchers at regular&#xD;
      intervals for a period of up to 8 hours from placing the first cannula. After the first blood&#xD;
      samples have been taken (Time -30) the researchers will start pumping fat labelled with&#xD;
      special atoms (stable isotopes from CK Isotopes Limited) into the other cannula. After&#xD;
      approximately 30 minutes of infusion, a second blood sample (time 0) will be taken, after&#xD;
      which participants will be fed a standardised test meal which will consist of cereal and&#xD;
      semi-skimmed milk and a &quot;fatty&quot; chocolate drink. The fatty chocolate drink is made with a&#xD;
      blend of oils and will be labelled with a stable isotope (from CK Isotopes Limited). The use&#xD;
      of the stable isotopes in small doses is considered to be completely harmless (it is not&#xD;
      radioactive). Once the test meal is consumed, the volunteer is free to rest on a bed or in a&#xD;
      chair, as they prefer, until the experiment is finished, up to 8 hours. After giving the&#xD;
      stable isotopes, blood and breath samples will be taken initially every 30 minutes for the&#xD;
      first two hours and then every 60 minutes up until the end of the study day (6 hours post&#xD;
      breakfast). The researchers would take blood samples through the cannula in the vein, and at&#xD;
      each time point would take approx. 25ml of blood. The most blood taken in total over the day&#xD;
      would be 250ml or approximately 1/2 of a pint.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three hours after consumption of the test breakfast meal the researchers will take two&#xD;
      adipose tissue biopsies. The first biopsy will be taken from the fat just under the skin in&#xD;
      the abdomen (tummy) and the second biopsy will be taken from the gluteal (buttock) region.&#xD;
      There will be numbing of the skin and fat tissue as a local anaesthetic (1% lignocaine) is&#xD;
      used prior to all biopsies. The choice as to whether or not to undergo biopsies will be given&#xD;
      to participants on the study day. At some point during the day a dual energy X-ray&#xD;
      absorptiometry (DEXA) scan will be performed. The DEXA scan will measure the total amount of&#xD;
      fat (adipose tissue) along with the amount of adipose tissue in specific depots (e.g. upper&#xD;
      body, lower body, visceral etc.). When all of the samples have been taken and the&#xD;
      measurements are finished, the researchers would take out the plastic tubes, and give the&#xD;
      participant something further to eat and drink before making sure they can get home, usually&#xD;
      by providing them with a taxi. Participants will also be provided with the sulforaphane&#xD;
      capsules to be ingested over the following 3-week period, and guidelines as to when to take&#xD;
      supplements. Participants will be asked to maintain their habitual diets during the&#xD;
      intervention phase, which will be assessed via the completion of food diaries where all foods&#xD;
      and beverages consumed on 3 days a week (two week and one weekend day) each week of the 3&#xD;
      week intervention phase. A member of the research team will be in regular contact with&#xD;
      participants via email throughout the intervention phase in an attempt to maintain&#xD;
      compliance. Following the 3-week intervention phase the volunteer's liver and heart fat&#xD;
      content will again be measured using MRI/S at OCMR, then on a separate day, within one week&#xD;
      of having their liver and heart fat content measured, participants will come into the CRU at&#xD;
      OCDEM for a second 'study day' after an overnight fast. The second 'study day' will be&#xD;
      identical to the first study day described above.&#xD;
