  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The research study is being conducted to test an experimental vaccine to potentially prevent&#xD;
      cancer for people with BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations. This study will test if the vaccine is safe&#xD;
      (without significant side effects) and test a new way of administering vaccines. It will also&#xD;
      test whether the vaccine activates your immune system.&#xD;
