  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To determine the effects of multisensory stimulation and soft tissue therapy on procedural&#xD;
      pain and neurodevelopment among neonates admitted to the NICU is the aim of the study. The&#xD;
      study will be two groups randomized clinical trial of five days intervention program. The&#xD;
      intervention will be given among two groups. Group A will receive both multisensory&#xD;
      stimulation and soft tissue therapy, Group B will receive only regular hospital care. The&#xD;
      PIPP and N-PASS will be used for assessing pain. The INFANIB and Premie-Neuro will be used&#xD;
      for assessing neuromotor development among neonates. The outcomes will be taken before and&#xD;
      after the fifth day of the intervention. Multisensory stimulation and soft tissue therapy&#xD;
      might help in reducing pain and promoting neurodevelopment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will utilize two parallel groups, randomised design to analyze the effects of soft&#xD;
      tissue therapy and multisensory stimulation on pain and neurodevelopment. 104 neonates&#xD;
      admitted in NICU will be recruited through purposive sampling for the trial. Procedural pain&#xD;
      will be assessed with PIPP and N-PASS through recorded video. Neurodevelopmental outcomes&#xD;
      will be assessed with INFANIB Scale and Premie-Neuro. The measurements will be taken after 24&#xD;
      hours of birth at the baseline and after the fifth day of the intervention. The treatment&#xD;
      will be given into two groups i.e. Group A (Multisensory stimulation and soft tissue therapy&#xD;
      group), Group B (routine hospital care). MSS will consist of Auditory Stimulation,&#xD;
      Tacto-Kinesthetic stimulation, Vestibular stimulation, Visual stimulation, Oral-stimulation,&#xD;
      and Olfactive stimulation. Soft tissue therapy consisted of stroking, effleurage, skin&#xD;
      rolling, and kneading techniques, Will be given in 5 Phases-Forehead and face, Back and Neck,&#xD;
      Chest and abdomen, upper-lower limbs. Total 30 min. of the treatment plan, per day, will be&#xD;
      given to the neonates, after 30 min. of feed, for up to 5 days of NICU stay.&#xD;
