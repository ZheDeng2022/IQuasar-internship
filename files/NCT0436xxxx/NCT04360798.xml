  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      70% of the general population suffers ankle injuries at least once in their lifetime. The&#xD;
      ankle lateral ligament injuries cause an average of 6.9 days of work loss, and it has been&#xD;
      reported that the quality of life of these patients is affected by their long-term results.&#xD;
      Exercise training is important to prevent job loss, increase individuals' quality of life, or&#xD;
      speed up their return to work. Functional or chronic insufficiency resulting from ankle&#xD;
      ligament injury results in various abnormalities in the lower extremity. Motor coordination&#xD;
      disorders due to instability, adhesions, peroneal muscle weakness, and loss of proprioception&#xD;
      can be seen in the talus or subtalar joint. Instabilities are usually caused by loss of&#xD;
      strength after an acute lateral ligament injury, hypomobility in the joint, inadequate&#xD;
      improvement in proprioception, or inadequate healing of the ligament.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Almost 40% of patients with lateral ankle injury develop a condition known as chronic ankle&#xD;
      instability. The cause of chronic ankle instability is classified as mechanical ankle&#xD;
      instability (MAI) and functional ankle instability (FAI). While MAI is caused by ligament&#xD;
      laxity, other factors such as proprioceptive problems, neuromuscular problems, postural&#xD;
      control deficiencies, and muscle weakness are caused by FAI. For this reason, peroneal muscle&#xD;
      strengthening, Achilles tendon stretching, balance training, and proprioceptive training are&#xD;
      shown as the most important components of the treatment program in the rehabilitation of&#xD;
      ankle instabilities. (5) It has been reported by many researchers that functional instability&#xD;
      can be reduced and repetitive injuries can be prevented in patients given proprioceptive&#xD;
      training and peroneal muscle strengthening on the balance board. In the results of another&#xD;
      study evaluating bilaterally in the lower limb after balance training given to the intact&#xD;
      side in individuals with chronic ankle instability, it was stated that the balance function&#xD;
      of the unstable ankle was developed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the treatment methods of ankle instability vary, there are very limited studies&#xD;
      comparing treatment methods unilaterally and bilaterally in the ankle lateral instability in&#xD;
      the literature. Our study will contribute to the literature to the next rehabilitation&#xD;
      programs by comparing unilateral and bilateral exercise training prepared by rehabilitation&#xD;
      protocols in many ways in two different groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Ankle ligament injuries are one of the most common musculoskeletal injuries among physically&#xD;
      active people, accounting for ~ 14% of all sports-related orthopedic clinic visits. And it is&#xD;
      stated that injuries that delay the return to sports the most. 4% of these injuries and the&#xD;
      most common are the lateral ankle ligament injuries. 70% of the general population, not only&#xD;
      specific to sports, suffers ankle injuries at least once in their lifetime. The ankle lateral&#xD;
      ligament injuries cause an average of 6.9 days of work loss, and it has been reported that&#xD;
      the quality of life of these patients is affected by their long-term results. When people who&#xD;
      play sports are taken into consideration, an ankle sprain can affect the quality of life of&#xD;
      the individual, as well as reduce performance and keep it away from education and&#xD;
      competition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ankle sprains often occur during physical activities such as basketball and football, which&#xD;
      require sudden stops, bounces, landings, and swings around a stable foot. Most lateral ankle&#xD;
      sprains occur when combined with excessive inversion or adduction with additional plantar&#xD;
      flexion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Functional or chronic deficiencies develop in the lower limbs as a result of ankle ligament&#xD;
      injury, resulting in various abnormalities. Motor coordination disorders due to instability,&#xD;
      adhesions, peroneal muscle weakness, and loss of proprioception can be seen in the talus or&#xD;
      subtalar joint. Instabilities are usually caused by loss of strength after an acute lateral&#xD;
      ligament injury, hypomobility in the joint, inadequate improvement in proprioception, or&#xD;
      inadequate healing of the ligament. Almost 40% of patients with lateral ankle injury develop&#xD;
      a condition known as chronic ankle instability (CAI). CAI is characterized by the occurrence&#xD;
      of recurrent cases of instability that cause constant ankle sprain and the giving-way&#xD;
      sensation of the ankle after the first ankle sprain. The diagnostic criteria are detailed in&#xD;
      the International Ankle Consortium, Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) is often used to&#xD;
      evaluate functional ankle instability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Among the most important factors causing instability in the ankle are proprioceptive&#xD;
      disorders, pain, and muscle weakness. Therefore, rehabilitation programs generally focus on&#xD;
      exercises that include muscle strengthening, balance training, neuromuscular training, and&#xD;
      proprioceptive training protocols. In another combined supporting study, Huang et al.&#xD;
      investigated the effects of combined balance exercises with plyometric exercise against&#xD;
      plyometric exercise in individuals with functional ankle instability and showed that the&#xD;
      combined program will reduce postural oscillation in static conditions, and improve stability&#xD;
      and energy propagation models in dynamic postural control. One of the factors contributing to&#xD;
      CAI is thought to be the loss of strength of the ankle circumference muscle groups in both&#xD;
      concentric and eccentric directions. It is assumed that a decrease in the strength of the&#xD;
      muscles of the more proximal joints, such as knee and hip, not just ankle oriented, may also&#xD;
      be effective in the formation of CAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It has been shown in systematic review and meta-analysis that proprioception disorder&#xD;
      contributes to chronic ankle imbalance. In another study in individuals with unilateral&#xD;
      chronic ankle instability, both extremities were evaluated in terms of strength and&#xD;
      proprioception, a decrease in the sensation of kinesthesia was observed, and loss of eversion&#xD;
      force and proprioceptive disorders were reported on both sides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although ankle instability treatment approaches vary widely in all these studies, there is no&#xD;
      detailed study comparing applications unilaterally and bilaterally in the literature. Our&#xD;
      study will contribute to the literature to the next rehabilitation programs by comparing&#xD;
      unilateral and bilateral exercise training prepared by rehabilitation protocols in many ways&#xD;
      in two different groups&#xD;
