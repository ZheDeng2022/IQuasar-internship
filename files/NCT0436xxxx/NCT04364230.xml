  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study evaluates whether it is safe to administer a peptide vaccine made of 6MHP and a&#xD;
      mutated neoantigen peptide (BRAF585-614-V600E) combined with adjuvants. The adjuvants that&#xD;
      will be used in this trial are a CD40 antibody (CDX-1140) and a toll-like receptor (TLR) 3&#xD;
      agonist (Poly-ICLC). The study will also investigate the effects of the vaccine and the&#xD;
      adjuvants on the immune response. The investigators will monitor these effects by performing&#xD;
      tests in the laboratory on participants' blood and skin tissue.&#xD;
