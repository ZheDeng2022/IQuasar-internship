  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Surgery is the first choice of treatment for early-stage primary pulmonary malignancies, but&#xD;
      up to 15% of all patients, and 33% of patients greater than 75 years of age, are not surgical&#xD;
      candidate's due to locally advanced disease, poor cardiopulmonary reserve and significant&#xD;
      medical co-morbidities. Some patients are also unwilling to undergo surgery. This has&#xD;
      prompted the development of alternatives to surgery so that local control of unresectable&#xD;
      tumors can be achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is currently an alternative therapy for these&#xD;
      patients with 3-year survival rates of between 42 and 60%. SBRT has excellent local control&#xD;
      rates and a favorable toxicity profile relative to other surgical and non-surgical therapies.&#xD;
      Radiation pneumonitis (RP), amongst others, is one of the major toxicities which can limit&#xD;
      the maximal radiation dose that can be safely delivered to thoracic tumors. Reported rates of&#xD;
      SBRT induced RP requiring clinical intervention range from 0% to 29% and life-threatening&#xD;
      toxicities have been reported in up to 12% of cases in various studies. The potential for&#xD;
      toxicities from SBRT could limit the number of times a patient could be treated with SBRT for&#xD;
      residual, recurrent or new pulmonary lesions over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the first report of thermal ablation for lung malignancies in 2000, this modality&#xD;
      has been used to treat primary and secondary malignancies and has emerged as an effective,&#xD;
      low-cost, safe and repeatable alternative to SBRT for local tumour control. The most widely&#xD;
      practised technique is radiofrequency ablation (RFA). Microwave ablation (MWA) is a&#xD;
      relatively new therapy and offers all the advantages of RFA, but with significant additional&#xD;
      advantages 3. These include reduced procedure times, lower complication rates, increased&#xD;
      ablative temperatures, improved propagation of thermal energy particularly in the lung,&#xD;
      improved efficacy in lesions that are in close proximity to blood vessels due to reduced&#xD;
      heat-sink effect, and less procedure associated pain 2,3. Using high energy MWA to treat 87&#xD;
      pulmonary tumors, Egashira et al achieved a primary technical success rate of 94% and&#xD;
      technique effectiveness of 98% at a median of 15 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MWA is performed by Interventional Radiologists using CT guidance. The treatment is performed&#xD;
      under general anaesthesia and is repeatable. Multiple lesions can be ablated in one treatment&#xD;
      session. Patients can potentially be discharged the same day of treatment, if there are no&#xD;
      adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MWA is a relatively new treatment option that could be considered in situations where the&#xD;
      patient is not a candidate for further treatment with surgery, SBRT or chemotherapy, or the&#xD;
      patient declines the recommended standard available treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives for Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective for Phase I of this study will be to demonstrate the Safety of MWA&#xD;
      performed for treatment of lung malignancy in patients not suitable for surgery, chemotherapy&#xD;
      or SBRT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective (Safety): to determine the proportion of patients experiencing local&#xD;
      adverse events at one week definitively related to the mwa procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective (Feasibility): To determine the proportion of patients in whom technical&#xD;
      success of MWA was achieved by assessing completion of ablation on CT at the time of the&#xD;
      procedure, indicated by replacement of tumor by ground glass change (including a 5mm ablation&#xD;
      zone in normal surrounding lung parenchyma).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives for Phase II Primary objective (Efficacy): To demonstrate efficacy by measuring&#xD;
      the proportion of patients demonstrating absence of residual tumor on follow up CT at 1 month&#xD;
      after MWA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective: To determine the proportion of patients needing re-treatment for&#xD;
      recurrent tumor at 1 month post MWA.&#xD;
