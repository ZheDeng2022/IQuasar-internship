      This research is being done to study the effects of the combination of ipilimumab, nivolumab,&#xD;
      and radiation therapy in people with microsatellite stable pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;

      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial study testing the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of the combination of ipilimumab, nivolumab, and radiation therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study procedures include screening for eligibility, and study treatment&#xD;
      including evaluations and follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be in this research study for as long as the study interventions are safe&#xD;
      and beneficial. Participants will then be followed for up to 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The names of the study interventions involved in this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Ipilimumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nivolumab&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiation Therapy It is expected that about 30 people will take part in this research&#xD;
           study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ipilimumab and Nivolumab are both antibodies. An antibody is a protein that attaches to other&#xD;
      cells to fight off infection. The antibodies in ipilimumab work by not allowing cancer cell&#xD;
      growth. The antibodies in nivolumab work by causing programmed cell death of the cancer&#xD;
      cells. Radiation therapy may increase the likelihood of response to interventions like&#xD;
      ipilimumab and nivolumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved ipilimumab and nivolumab for&#xD;
      microsatellite stable pancreatic cancer. but they have been approved for other uses.&#xD;
