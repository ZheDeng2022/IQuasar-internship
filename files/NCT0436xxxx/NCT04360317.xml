  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is designed as a single Group, Dose Elevating trial which evaluates safety to&#xD;
      confirm the final maximum tolerated dose by the combination of oral administration of SH003&#xD;
      to docetaxel administered patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Firstly, 3 subjects is recruited and administered for 21 days for the starting dose of 2,400&#xD;
      mg / day. If no DLT occurs, raise the dose to a secondary dose of 3,600 mg / day. If DLT&#xD;
      occurs, additional 3 subjects are recruited and administered for 2,400mg / day. After, If two&#xD;
      or more of the six subjects shows DLT, stop the capacity increase, whereas if DLT occurs in&#xD;
      less than 1 person, increase the dose to 3,600 mg / day. Next, 3 subjects is recruited and&#xD;
      administered for 21 days for a dose of 3,600 mg / day. If no DLT occurs, raise the dose to&#xD;
      4,800 mg / day. If DLT occurs, 3 subjects are additionally recruited and administered for&#xD;
      3,600 mg / day. After, If two or more of the six subjects shows DLT, stop the capacity&#xD;
      increase, whereas if DLT occurs in less than 1 person, increase the dose to 4,800 mg / day.&#xD;
      Finally, 3 subjects is recruited and administered for a dose of 4,800 mg / day. If no DLT&#xD;
      occurs, complete the study. If DLT occurs, additional 3 subjects are recruited and&#xD;
      administered for 4,800mg / day and complete the study after observation.&#xD;
