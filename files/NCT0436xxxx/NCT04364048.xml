      Single arm study of induction durvalumab (1500 mg IV) for 1 cycle (every 4 weeks),&#xD;
      administered prior to starting concurrent definitive chemoradiation, followed by&#xD;
      consolidation durvalumab (1500 mg IV every 4 weeks) for up to 12 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include an initial safety run-in portion. Patients in the safety run-in will&#xD;
      be monitored through completion of induction durvalumab, chemoradiation, and 2 cycles of&#xD;
      consolidation durvalumab for assessment of safety prior to completion of enrollment.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Eligibility Criteria for Consolidation Durvalumab&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have recovered from toxicities associated with prior chemoradiation to&#xD;
