      This study protocol evaluates the use of hysteroscopic endomyometrial resection in women&#xD;
      diagnosed with atypical endometrial hyperplasia or grade I endometrial cancer who have not&#xD;
      responded to anti-hormone therapy. Patients in this study wish to preserve fertility.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Endometrial cancer (EC) is the most common gynecological cancer among Canadian women. This&#xD;
      cancer often arises from a precursor lesion called atypical endometrial hyperplasia (AH).&#xD;
      Hysterectomy is the most effective treatment for EC and AH. It is well recognized that EC may&#xD;
      be diagnosed in younger women of child-bearing age. The diagnosis of EC or AH in these&#xD;
      younger women is devastating as a hysterectomy is frequently required. Though some of these&#xD;
      women respond to high-dose progestin treatment, the failure rate is high (60%), necessitating&#xD;
      surgery. Recent case series show that some women with AH and early EC can be treated by&#xD;
      resecting the precursor lesion of the early cancerous area in the uterus by hysteroscopy&#xD;
      without the need for hysterectomy. The fertility-sparing approach is outlined in this&#xD;
      research protocol.This is a multidisciplinary research project with input from gynaecologic&#xD;
      oncology, general gynaecology, reproductive endocrinology and infertility, and pathology. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that hysteroscopic resection (HR) is a safe and effective treatment for AH or&#xD;
      EC in women who want to preserve their fertility and have not been successfully treated using&#xD;
      progestin therapy. Patients will be closely monitored to ensure that this is a safe and&#xD;
      effective treatment option.&#xD;

    <description>Hysteroscopic Resection will be evaluated as a fertility-sparing treatment for patients with early Endometrial Cancer or Endometrial Hyperplasia (atypical or persisting typical) who fail progestin therapy. Failure of progesterone therapy is defined as: (a) Unsuccessful eradication of hyperplasia or cancer in the uterus or (b) Intolerance to the side effects of th hormone therapy.&#xD;
HR is a common gynecologic procedure that is offered to women for treatment of several benign gynecologic conditions. The conduct, risks, and complications of it are well-understood. In relation to this protocol, it is the indication for HR that constitutes the experimental intervention including the assessment of it's outcome. Patients deemed appropriate for hysteroscopic endomyometrial resection will be counselled on the nature of the procedure along with its risks and complications.</description>

        All candidates for this protocol must have an adequate trial of anti-hormone therapy prior&#xD;
        to hysteroscopic resection. In cases of EC, the minimum trial is 6 months of high-dose&#xD;
        progestin. In cases of AH, being that this is a benign condition (pre-malignant), patients&#xD;
        may not require a full 6 months of anti-hormone therapy. All patients must have a pre-HR&#xD;
        hysteroscopic evaluation to confirm that they are suitable candidates for this study.&#xD;
        Patients being considered for the experimental intervention (hysteroscopic resection) will&#xD;
        be reviewed and discussed by the study committee in order to ensure that the following&#xD;
        criterion are met in order to proceed with the surgical resection:&#xD;
