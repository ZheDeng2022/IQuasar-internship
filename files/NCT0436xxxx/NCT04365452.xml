      To assess patient centered outcomes of the Medela INVIA Motion prophylactic NPWT system at&#xD;
      cesarean delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be a two center case series of women undergoing caesarean delivery conducted&#xD;
      at two medical centers in Indianapolis, Indiana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients meeting inclusion criteria will be included. All enrolled patients will receive&#xD;
      the Medela INVIA Motion prophylactic NPWT device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit A: Interventional Procedure All enrolled patients will receive the Medela INVIA Motion&#xD;
      device placed by the patient's surgeon after the skin is closed with subcuticular suture or&#xD;
      staples. Research staff and clinicians (labor &amp; delivery and postpartum nurses, OR&#xD;
      technicians, physicians, etc.) involved in the study will receive formal training on how to&#xD;
      place and remove the prophylactic NPWT device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit B: Post Procedure until Discharge Patients will be monitored daily while in the&#xD;
      hospital by clinical staff and/or research staff for complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The negative pressure wound therapy dressing will be removed on the day of discharge. If the&#xD;
      patient remains hospitalized for more than 7 days, the dressing will be removed on&#xD;
      postoperative day 7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Replacement of any dressing that is saturated. If a patient develops infection with the NPWT&#xD;
      device in place the device will be removed and the patient given standard SSI therapy as&#xD;
      outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be educated about the signs and symptoms of infection and other study outcomes&#xD;
      and encouraged to call their provider if these should arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff document inpatient course regarding SSI. Management of surgical site&#xD;
      infections will follow the Practice Guidelines of the Infectious Diseases Society of America.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit C: Postpartum Follow Up&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will use active surveillance by research staff to ascertain surgical site infections:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will follow-up with the research participant at time of discharge or within 48&#xD;
      hours post discharge (postpartum day 1-9) to assess for adverse events, assess the&#xD;
      participant's pain, obtain their satisfaction with their dressing and aesthetic appearance of&#xD;
      the incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research staff will call subjects on approximately postoperative day 30 (Â±2 days). They will&#xD;
      ask the patient standardized questions regarding wound complications, patient satisfaction,&#xD;
      pain and aesthetic appearance. If the patient reports a hospital, clinic, or ER visit not&#xD;
      associated with the study centers, the staff will obtain the name of the medical facility and&#xD;
      request the records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The EQ-5D-3L quality of life questionnaire will be administered at the 30-day call.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical records from postpartum clinic visits as well as records of unscheduled visits (to&#xD;
      any hospital clinic or ER) will be sought to ascertain study outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of the subject's standard of care postpartum appointment about 4-6 weeks after&#xD;
      inpatient hospital discharge research staff will collect information on outcomes, pain and&#xD;
      patient satisfaction. If the patient does not attend the clinical postpartum visit, the study&#xD;
      staff will contact the subject by phone to collect the data.&#xD;
