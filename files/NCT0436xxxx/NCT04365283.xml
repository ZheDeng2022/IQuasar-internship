      ACTIVA BioACTIVE products are allegedly the first dental resins with a bioactive ionic resin&#xD;
      matrix, shock-absorbing rubberized resin component, and reactive ionomer glass fillers that&#xD;
      mimic the physical and chemical properties of natural teeth. These bioactive materials&#xD;
      actively participate in the cycles of ionic exchange that regulate the natural chemistry of&#xD;
      our teeth and saliva and contribute to the maintenance of tooth structure and oral health.&#xD;
      They are claimed to have the strength, esthetics and physical properties of composites and&#xD;
      are more bioactive than glass ionomers, combining the best attributes of both materials&#xD;
      without compromising either one.&#xD;

      High caries risk patients are those who have high DMF index, high sugar intake, poor oral&#xD;
      hygiene, inadequate salivary flow, low pH level, as well as deficient fluoride exposure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, their management has to be adequate and proper. To overcome these setbacks, glass&#xD;
      ionomer cements that have advantages such as similar coefficient of thermal expansion to&#xD;
      natural tooth tissue, physicochemical adhesion to tooth structure, biocompatability, fluoride&#xD;
      release, low shrinkage and low marginal leakage as well as anticaries properties and&#xD;
      increased remineralization interproximally ,which is especially beneficial in high risk&#xD;
      caries patients, have been considered as an alternative restorative material to composite and&#xD;
      amalgam. To enhance the mechanical properties of GIs, their constituents have been modified&#xD;
      Comparatively, resin-modified glass ionomer (RMGIs) with a longer working time, faster&#xD;
      setting, higher early strength, and improved appearance and translucency. Unfortunately, the&#xD;
      RMGI's mechanical properties of are different to resin composites. Progressive development of&#xD;
      material sciences has resulted in the introduction of bioactive restorative materials. These&#xD;
      materials can activate a tissue repair mechanism for or synthesis and elicit a response from&#xD;
      teeth and surrounding environment. ACTIVA BioACTIVE products are allegedly the first dental&#xD;
      resins with a bioactive ionic resin matrix, shock-absorbing rubberized resin component, and&#xD;
      reactive ionomer glass fillers that mimic the physical and chemical properties of natural&#xD;
      teeth. These bioactive materials actively participate in the cycles of ionic exchange that&#xD;
      regulate the natural chemistry of our teeth and saliva and contribute to the maintenance of&#xD;
      tooth structure and oral health. They are claimed to have the strength, esthetics and&#xD;
      physical properties of composites and are more bioactive than glass ionomers, combining the&#xD;
      best attributes of both materials without compromising either one.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Activa Presto light-cured material from Pulpdent is the company's latest product that&#xD;
      features biomimicry as Activa Bioactive dual-cured material. The material diffuses fluoride,&#xD;
      calcium, and phosphate ions that fortify the saliva and help replace essential minerals that&#xD;
      are lost in the decay process. This highly esthetic, light-cured resin contains these ions in&#xD;
      a stackable resin matrix that holds its shape and does not slump. This durable product is&#xD;
      resistant to fracturing and wear, especially so on the thin areas of enamel bevels, and is&#xD;
      indicated for all restorative procedures replacing dentin and/or enamel, anterior or&#xD;
      posterior.&#xD;
