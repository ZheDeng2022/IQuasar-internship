  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Minor traumatic brain injury (mTBI) (Glasgow Coma Scale 13 to 15) represent 70 to 90% of&#xD;
      traumatic brain injury. Different disorders may occur after a traumatic minor brain injury&#xD;
      (somatic, cognitive or affective) within 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For 10 to 20% these symptoms are persistent and are part of post-concussion syndrome. Today a&#xD;
      small amount of tools to predict this syndrome are available. Cerebral CT scan, a routine&#xD;
      test for mTBI, isn't relevant to predict the post concussion syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to improve understanding of the evolution toward this complication, it seems&#xD;
      relevant to run a multimodal study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multiparameter MRI combined to psychological and sociological evaluations cold provide a&#xD;
      better global perception.&#xD;

    <description>Describe correlation between risk factor and the development of post-concussion syndrome.&#xD;
Describe risk factors as demographic factors and medical history correlated with the development of post-concussion syndrome.&#xD;
The risk factors studies will be:&#xD;
Age (median in years)&#xD;
Sex&#xD;
Cohabitation status&#xD;
Education&#xD;
Daily consumption of alcohol&#xD;
Smoking&#xD;
Glasgow score&#xD;
Loss of consciousness after the trauma&#xD;
Associated injuries This information will be obtained using the medical record and by interviewing the patient. The presence of post-concussion syndrome will be defined using the Rivermead Post-concussion Symptoms Questionnaire. The presence of post-concussion syndrome will correspond to a score higher than 12.</description>
