      INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of tranversus abdominis&#xD;
      plane (TAP) block placed postoperatively using ultrasound guidance for patients with&#xD;
      caesarean section, myomectomy and hysterectomy under general anesthesia by eliminating&#xD;
      additional pain caused by surgical incision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study has been planned to investigate the postoperative analgesia&#xD;
      of 50 patients with TAP blocks applied and non-applied between the ages of 18-65, who will&#xD;
      pass abdominal surgery. Study has been conducted in a prospective, randomized and controlled&#xD;
      manner. Patients have been classified as those who have undergone TAP block (group: I) and&#xD;
      those without block (group: II).&#xD;

      The study was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration Principles (rev.2013) and&#xD;
      with the approval of the local ethical board. After the written and signed approval of the&#xD;
      patients, it has been planned to investigate the postoperative analgesia and comfort of a&#xD;
      total of 50 patients The study examined the postoperative pain levels after abdominal surgery&#xD;
      with and without TAP block. Subjects were between the ages of 18-65 who will have abdominal&#xD;
      surgery with transverse incision (cesarean section, hysterectomy (benign), myomectomy) and&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists Physical Status Classification System (ASA) I-II. Our&#xD;
      study is planned to be prospective, randomized and controlled. The individuals to be engaged&#xD;
      were divided into two groups in a randomized form. Randomization was based on a&#xD;
      computer-generated code. In the first group, a total of 25 patients were admitted with 16&#xD;
      cesareans, 6 myomectomies and 3 hysterectomies applied to the TAP block. In the second group,&#xD;
      a total of 25 patients who did not undergo TAP block, no needle intervention, 18 cesareans, 5&#xD;
      myomectomies and 2 hysterectomies were included as the control group. Those with skin&#xD;
      infections, patients with organomegaly (hepatomegaly and splenomegaly), people who did not&#xD;
      give consent to the method, and individuals with allergies to drugs to be used in the&#xD;
      intervention area where Transversus abdominis plane is to be conducted were not included in&#xD;
      the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Isolyte® balanced electrolyte solution at a rate of 2 ml/kg/hour was administered to the&#xD;
      individuals whose oral intake was discontinued 8 hours before the surgery. The individuals to&#xD;
      be included in the study were not given any sedative agent on the morning of their surgery.&#xD;
      10 cm visual analog scale (VAS) was explained in detail to all patients before the procedure.&#xD;
      All individuals to be included in the study were followed up with anesthesia monitor (Drager&#xD;
      Infinity Vista XL®), heart rate (CAH), electrocardiography (ECG) (lead II), systolic blood&#xD;
      pressure (SKB) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in the preoperative and preoperative&#xD;
      period. After induction of anesthesia with 1 µg/kg fentanyl (Fentanyl, Janssen-Cilag), 0.5&#xD;
      mg/kg rocuronium bromide (Esmeron® vial, Schering-Plough) and 5 mg/kg thiopental sodium&#xD;
      (Pental Sodium®, I.E Ulagay), 4-6% Desflurane (Suprane® Volatile Solution, Pharmacist-Head -&#xD;
      Baxter) and 50% N2O in Oxygen were used to maintain anesthesia following endotracheal&#xD;
      intubation. Differently in general anesthesia management at cesarean operations, 5 mg/kg&#xD;
      thiopental sodium (Pental Sodium®, I.E Ulagay) and 0.5 mg/kg rocuronium bromide (Esmeron®&#xD;
      vial, Schering-Plough) were administered in induction and 4-6% Desflurane (Suprane® Volatile&#xD;
      Solution, Pharmaceutical-headed-Baxter), (50% N2O+50% Oxygen) and 1 µg/kg fentanyl (Fentanyl,&#xD;
      Janssen-Cilag) are added as inhalation anesthesia after umbilical cord clamping in&#xD;
      maintenance. The maintenance dose of rocuronium bromide was 0.15 mg/kg for all cases.&#xD;
      Necessary fluid replacement was performed during the operation. At the end of the operation,&#xD;
      TAP blocks were placed to the 1st group patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the necessary sterilization conditions were established, the linear ultrasound probe&#xD;
      was sterilely coated and placed in the middle of the iliac crest with the end limit of the&#xD;
      ribs. Starting with skin, the layers in descending order, subcutaneous adipose tissue,&#xD;
      external oblique muscle, internal oblique muscle, transversus abdominis muscle and peritoneum&#xD;
      were identified. As the tip of the 21Gx100 mm needle (Pajunk®-Uniplex Nanoline cannula with&#xD;
      facet tip) passed through the muscular layers and fascia, a fascial click was felt and the&#xD;
      needle was advanced with ultrasound in a controlled manner. After receiving the second click&#xD;
      sensation (passage of the fascia of the internal oblique muscle), after a 0.5-1 ml test dose,&#xD;
      the location of the needle was fixed and frequently aspirated and applied to the bilateral&#xD;
      neurophysical plan so that 20 ml of 0.25% bupivacaine (Marcaine® 0.5%, Astra Zeneca) was&#xD;
      applied to one side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first group of patients were awakened after TAP block treatment and reversal of muscle&#xD;
      relaxant with atropine sulphate and neostigmine; the control group was awakened after&#xD;
      reversal of muscle relaxant with atropine sulphate and neostigmine at the end of the&#xD;
      operation. When VAS&gt;3 in the postoperative period, 1g of paracetamol was administered as an&#xD;
      intravenous infusion over 10 minutes in terms of the first analgesic requirement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, heart rate of all patients were monitored&#xD;
      immediately before and postoperatively at 30th minute and 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 12th and 24th&#xD;
      hours after block administration. The pain levels of the patients were measured at the 30th&#xD;
      minute, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 6th, 12th and 24th postoperative VAS values. The need for nausea,&#xD;
      vomiting, and initial analgesia was recorded. In this study, none of the patients underwent&#xD;
      any invasive procedures other than routine procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      When parametric test counts were fulfilled (Kolmogorov-Simirnov) by uploading the data&#xD;
      obtained from our study to SPSS (ver:22.0) program, significance test of the difference&#xD;
      between the two averages, variance analysis in repeated measurements, Bonferroni test, Mann&#xD;
      Whitney U test, Wilcoxon test, Freidman test and Chi-square test were used when parametric&#xD;
      test assumptions were not fulfilled. When α is taken as 0.05, β: 0.10, 1-β: 0.90, 25&#xD;
      individuals were included in each group and the strength of the test was p= 0.90388.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our data were reported as arithmetic mean, standard deviation, number of individuals and the&#xD;
      level of error was taken as 0.05.&#xD;
