    <textblock>
      This clinical study is aiming to determine the safest doses and schedule for the combination&#xD;
      of two drugs named palbociclib and avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also be investigating how effective the combination is for a subgroup of&#xD;
      breast cancer patients whose cancer expresses the androgen receptor (AR) but not the&#xD;
      oestrogen (hormone) or HER2 receptors. Palbociclib is a drug used in routine care for&#xD;
      hormone-receptor (HR) positive and HER2 negative advanced breast cancer, the most common&#xD;
      subtype of breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is possible that the combination of palbociclib and avelumab will be a more effective&#xD;
      cancer treatment than each drug separately, but this is unknown and this study is needed to&#xD;
      establish the best dosage and schedule of each drug as well as how effective the combination&#xD;
      is.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a phase Ib study designed to confirm the safety and evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      palbociclib combined with avelumab in AR positive TNBC. It is a multi-centre study design (it&#xD;
      will run at several hospitals in the UK).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Palbociclib inhibits two proteins involved in cell growth called cyclin dependent kinase 4&#xD;
      and cyclin dependent kinase 6 (CDK4/6). Inhibiting CDK4/6 stops cells, such as cancer cells,&#xD;
      from dividing and multiplying further. Palbociclib is currently approved for the treatment of&#xD;
      metastatic HR positive HER2 negative breast cancer, based on good results from large clinical&#xD;
      trials. Laboratory studies have shown that palbociclib might be also useful in some patients&#xD;
      with triple negative breast cancer, an aggressive subtype of breast cancer that does not&#xD;
      express the hormone receptors or HER2 receptor, but only if the cancer is positive for the&#xD;
      androgen-receptor (AR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avelumab is an immunotherapy drug which does not destroy cancer cells, but tries to stimulate&#xD;
      the body's immune system to do this. Avelumab has been tested in a number of different types&#xD;
      of tumours including breast cancer, but although approved for use in the USA, it is not&#xD;
      currently an approved standard treatment in the UK. The combination of both drugs has never&#xD;
      been tested in humans before.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment to Part A will be conducted only at the Royal Marsden Hospital and Part A of the&#xD;
      study will establish the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and optimal schedule of the combination&#xD;
      in any suitable patients with advanced breast cancer. Once this dose schedule has been&#xD;
      confirmed, the chosen dose level will be recruited to, aiming to include 27 patients with AR&#xD;
      positive TNBC (Part B).Part B will recruit at up to 8 high volume centres. The androgen&#xD;
      receptor is not routinely tested for in hospital laboratories, so patients with advanced&#xD;
      triple negative breast cancer who are interested in taking part in the study will be asked to&#xD;
      provide consent for previously taken cancer samples/biopsies to be sent to the Royal Marsden&#xD;
      for testing, to see if the cancer expresses the androgen receptor, which would make&#xD;
      participants potentially eligible for part B of the study. Approximately 20% of triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancers express AR. This phase of the study will include important&#xD;
      translational work using new cancer samples (biopsies) and blood samples to investigate&#xD;
      potential &quot;biomarkers&quot; -predictors of efficacy and resistance to the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part A of the study, patients with previously treated, advanced breast cancer will have an&#xD;
      ECG (heart trace) a CT scan of the body and potentially an MRI scan of the brain and a bone&#xD;
      scan (depending upon where the breast cancer is known to have spread to) as well as blood&#xD;
      tests to determine if participants are suitable for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the study participants will receive daily palbociclib tablets and intravenous&#xD;
      infusions of avelumab every two weeks. Participants will be monitored with regular blood&#xD;
      tests and repeat CT scans every 8 weeks. At whatever time point the treatment stops working,&#xD;
      the patient will stop treatment and will be asked to have further blood tests one month later&#xD;
      as well as a check up with the study doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part B of the study, patients with triple negative histology and positive androgen&#xD;
      receptor status tested at the Royal Marsden will be required to have a cancer biopsy before&#xD;
      participants start treatment on the study. LIke in Part A, participants will also have an ECG&#xD;
      (heart trace)a CT scan of the body and potentially an MRI scan of the brain and a bone scan&#xD;
      (depending upon where the breast cancer is known to have spread to) as well as blood tests to&#xD;
      determine if participants are suitable for the study. During the study participants will&#xD;
      receive daily palbociclib tablets and intravenous infusions of avelumab every two weeks.&#xD;
      Participants will be monitored with regular blood tests and check-ups with the study doctor&#xD;
      and repeat CT scans every 8 weeks as well as additional blood tests for research. After 3&#xD;
      weeks of treatment, the patient may have a further tumour biopsy, which is optional. At&#xD;
      whatever timepoint the treatment stops working, the patient will stop treatment and will be&#xD;
      asked to have further blood tests and a further biopsy. Participants will also have a&#xD;
      check-up with the study doctor and blood tests one month later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 45 breast cancer patients will be enrolled; up to 18 patients in part A and 27&#xD;
      patients with AR+ triple negative breast cancer in part B.&#xD;

             year) or active suicidal ideation or behaviour; or laboratory abnormalities that may&#xD;
             increase the risk associated with study participation or study treatment&#xD;
             administration or may interfere with the interpretation of study results and, in the&#xD;
             judgment of the investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for entry into this&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients on warfarin. Patients requiring anticoagulation for rate-controlled AF or&#xD;

             positive HBV or HCV test indicating acute or chronic infection&#xD;
&#xD;

             pregnancy test within 7 days prior to treatment initiation)&#xD;
&#xD;
         18. Diagnosis of other malignancy within 3 years, except for adequately treated basal cell&#xD;
             or squamous cell skin cancer, or carcinoma in situ of the breast or cervix, or&#xD;
             low-grade (Gleason ≤6) prostate cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
         19. Is a participant or plans to participate in another interventional clinical trial,&#xD;

             acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
         20. Known prior or suspected hypersensitivity to investigational products or to any of the&#xD;
             excipients&#xD;
&#xD;
         21. Vaccination within 4 weeks of the first dose of avelumab and while on trial is&#xD;
             prohibited except for administration of inactivated vaccines. Live vaccines must also&#xD;
             be avoided for 3 months after the last dose of avelumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
         22. Any psychiatric condition that would prohibit the understanding or rendering of&#xD;
             informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
         23. Requirement for continued use of preparations containing St. John's Wort is&#xD;
             specifically contraindicated. Other herbal medicinal or natural products that patient&#xD;
             is intended to take during the trial must be explored at the beginning and during the&#xD;
             course of the trial and discussed with the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
         24. Requirement for continued use of CYP3A inhibitors, inducers or substrates (listed in&#xD;
             Appendix 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
         25. Patients with rare hereditary problems of galactose intolerance, the Lapp lactase&#xD;
             deficiency, or glucose-galactose malabsorption should not take this medicine as this&#xD;
             medicinal product contains lactose.&#xD;
&#xD;
         26. Any other condition which in the Investigator's opinion would not make the patient a&#xD;
             good candidate for the clinical trial.&#xD;
