    <textblock>
      This Phase II study will recruit 40 metastatic non-small cell lung cancer patients who failed&#xD;
      treatment with a platinum-containing doublet treatment and an anti-PD1 or PD-L1 immune&#xD;
      checkpoint antibody, administered simultaneously or sequentially. All recruited patients will&#xD;
      receive AB-16B5 at a dose of 12 mg/kg once weekly combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75&#xD;
      mg/m2 once every 3 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label, single-arm, multi-center Phase II trial of AB-16B5 in combination with&#xD;
      docetaxel in previously treated subjects with metastatic non-small cell lung cancer who have&#xD;
      experienced disease progression following treatment with a platinum-containing doublet&#xD;
      treatment and an anti-PD1 or PD-L1 immune checkpoint antibody, administered simultaneously or&#xD;
      sequentially. Approximately 40 subjects will be enrolled in this trial and receive AB-16B5 at&#xD;
      a dose of 12 mg/kg once weekly on Days 1, 8 and 15 combined with docetaxel at a dose of 75&#xD;
      mg/m2 once every 3 weeks on Day 1. One cycle of treatment will consist of 21 days (3 weeks).&#xD;
      The safety profile of the AB-16B5 and docetaxel combination will be examined during a safety&#xD;
      lead-in period with the first 8 subjects completing one cycle of treatment. No dose&#xD;
      escalation will be performed but a decision to de-escalate the AB-16B5 dose could be made&#xD;
      using the modified toxicity probability interval method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated every 6 weeks with radiographic imaging to assess response to&#xD;
      treatment using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 criteria for&#xD;
      determination of the objective response rate (ORR) and progression free survival (PFS).&#xD;
      Paired tumor biopsies (pre-treatment and on-treatment) will be collected in all subjects.&#xD;
      Study treatment will continue until there is evidence of disease progression,&#xD;
      treatment-related adverse events of unacceptable severity, subject request for&#xD;
      discontinuation or Investigator determination that further treatment is not in the subject's&#xD;
      best interest. Treatment through progression will be allowed if the Investigator considers&#xD;
      the subject to be clinically stable. Subjects who must discontinue docetaxel due to toxicity&#xD;
      will continue on AB-16B5.&#xD;
