      A clinical study to investigate the effect of an investigational drug in adults with&#xD;
      schizophrenia by using Electrocardiogram (Picture of the electrical action of the heart).&#xD;
      This study is accepting male and female participants between 18 years old -65 years old who&#xD;
      have been diagnosed with schizophrenia. This study will be conducted in approximately 7&#xD;
      locations in the US. The study will last approximately 7 weeks.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, randomized, single-dose, active and placebo controlled, 3-period crossover&#xD;
      study of the effect of SEP-363856 150 mg on electrocardiogram (ECG) intervals in subjects&#xD;
      with schizophrenia. SEP-363856 and matching placebo will be utilized in a double-blind&#xD;
      fashion. Moxifloxacin will be utilized as an active control in an open-label fashion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary analysis will be based on concentration-QTc modeling of the relationship between&#xD;
      plasma concentrations of SEP-363856 or its metabolite SEP-363854 and change-from baseline&#xD;
      QTc.&#xD;
