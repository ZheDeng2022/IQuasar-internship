  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to learn about how deep brain stimulation (DBS) affects brain&#xD;
      activity in those with Parkinson's disease (PD) and essential tremor (ET). The effect of&#xD;
      therapeutic and non-therapeutic stimulation settings will be assessed. Additionally, DBS&#xD;
      effects in the presence and absence of anti-PD medication will be studied. Also of interest&#xD;
      are differences in stimulation effects while at rest versus while performing a task.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Deep brain stimulation (DBS) is a standard-of-care, FDA approved therapy for Parkinson's&#xD;
      disease (PD) and tremor and well over 1,000 patients have been implanted at the Cleveland&#xD;
      Clinic in the past 20 years. The therapy involves stereotactic implantation of one or more&#xD;
      leads into specific sensorimotor brain regions, with each lead consisting of an array of four&#xD;
      to eight contacts. The proximal end of the lead is tunneled to an implantable pulse generator&#xD;
      (IPG) placed under the skin of the chest. Post-operatively, a health care professional&#xD;
      carefully programs the IPG: adjusting the delivery location (i.e., contact selection) and&#xD;
      titrating the frequency, amplitude, and width of the stimulus pulses to maximize therapeutic&#xD;
      benefit while minimizing any side effects. It is hypothesized that the chronic, electrical&#xD;
      stimulation of the target region has both local and circuit-wide effects, the net effect of&#xD;
      which is to disrupt the pathophysiological neural activity present across both cortical and&#xD;
      subcortical brain regions that is thought to underlie disease manifestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study-related activities will begin in the morning, with participants reporting to the Center&#xD;
      for Neurological Restoration outpatient clinic desk in the S-building. Those participants&#xD;
      with a diagnosis of Parkinson's disease will be asked to arrive in the &quot;practically defined&#xD;
      OFF&quot; state (i.e., will come for testing having taken PD medications as usual up to midnight&#xD;
      of the preceding day, and none on the morning of testing). To help to minimize off-medication&#xD;
      risks, patients with PD will be offered the option to stay overnight at an on-campus hotel at&#xD;
      no cost. Patients will be provided with lunch and additional rest breaks, as needed,&#xD;
      throughout the day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A technician will apply either Ag/AgCl clinical scalp electrodes or an elastic cap&#xD;
      pre-populated with electrodes after which electroencephalographic (EEG) activity will be&#xD;
      monitored and recorded throughout the remainder of the study. Participants will undergo an&#xD;
      initial stimulation threshold evaluation to establish DBS-related sensorimotor side effect&#xD;
      thresholds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Throughout testing, participants will be seated comfortably in a quiet room. Continuous EEG&#xD;
      and EMG recordings will be made as the parameters of the patients IPG are systematically&#xD;
      modified (i.e., changes in pulse frequency, amplitude, width and active contacts) with the&#xD;
      patient at rest and, for specific settings, again while the patient performs a simple,&#xD;
      continuous motor task using the upper extremity (e.g., computer-generated sine tracking).&#xD;
      Visual and auditory evoked potentials will be elicited using stimuli delivered via goggles&#xD;
      (or other light source) and headphones, respectively. Somatosensory evoked potentials will be&#xD;
      elicited through electrical stimulation of the median or posterior tibialis nerve using&#xD;
      standard clinical techniques at approximately 125% of motor threshold. Event related&#xD;
      potentials tasks will include simple and choice reaction time, NoGo, as well as auditory&#xD;
      oddball tasks repeated in one or more DBS conditions. Note that the precise order of test&#xD;
      administration may be randomized in order to minimize order effects. Also note that patients&#xD;
      diagnosed with PD will be instructed to take their usual dose of anti-PD medication&#xD;
      approximately mid-way through the test session, after which a subset of the evoked potential&#xD;
      testing will be repeated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators will use multiple non-invasive physiological metrics,&#xD;
      including scalp electroencephalography and surface electromyography, to characterize the&#xD;
      spatiotemporal pattern of cortical and corticomuscular modulation associated with&#xD;
      therapeutic, non-therapeutic, and side-effect-inducing parameters of DBS to address the&#xD;
      specific aims.&#xD;
