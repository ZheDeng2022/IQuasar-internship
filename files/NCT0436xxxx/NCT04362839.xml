    <textblock>
      This phase I trial studies the side effects and best dose of regorafenib when given together&#xD;
      with ipilimumab and nivolumab in treating patients with microsatellite stable colorectal&#xD;
      cancer that has spread to other places in the body (metastatic) and remains despite&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment (resistant). Regorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Immunotherapy with monoclonal&#xD;
      antibodies, such as ipilimumab and nivolumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      regorafenib, ipilimumab and nivolumab may slow the tumor growth and/or shrink the tumor size&#xD;
      in patients with colorectal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the recommended dose level of the combination of regorafenib, nivolumab and&#xD;
      ipilimumab in patients with advanced metastatic colorectal cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the objective overall response rate per Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid&#xD;
      Tumors (RECIST) version (v)1.1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Estimate the duration of response, duration of stable disease (SD), progression free&#xD;
      survival (PFS), and overall survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Describe the safety of this regimen as determined by frequency and severity of&#xD;
      associated adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Correlate the presence of colony stimulating factor 1 receptor (CSF1R)+ macrophages,&#xD;
      regulatory T cells (Tregs), TILs (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) and tumor PD-L1, CTLA-4 and&#xD;
      PD1 expression (at baseline and post treatment) on tumor biopsies with response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Characterize the systemic immune alteration through evaluation of mandatory pre and post&#xD;
      cycle 1, and cycle 2, and at progression blood draws.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of regorafenib.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive regorafenib orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days 1-21, nivolumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 2 weeks (Q2W), and ipilimumab IV over 30 minutes&#xD;
      every 6 weeks (Q6W). Cycles repeat every 28 day for up to 2 years in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 and 90 days, then every 3&#xD;
      months for up to 5 years.&#xD;
