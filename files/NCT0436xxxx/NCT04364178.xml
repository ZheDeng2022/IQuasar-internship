  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary purpose of this phase I/II study is to evaluate whether partially matched, ≥2/6&#xD;
      HLA-matched, viral specific T cells have efficacy against adenovirus, CMV, and EBV, in&#xD;
      subjects who have previously received any type of allogeneic HCT or solid organ transplant&#xD;
      (SOT), or have compromised immunity. Reconstitution of anti-viral immunity by donor-derived&#xD;
      cytotoxic T lymphocytes has shown promise in preventing and treating infections with&#xD;
      adenovirus, CMV, and EBV. However, the weeks taken to prepare patient-specific products, and&#xD;
      cost associated with products that may not be used limits their value. In this trial, we will&#xD;
      evaluate viral specific T cells generated by gamma capture technology. Eligible patients will&#xD;
      include HCT and/or SOT recipients, and/or patients with compromised immunity who have&#xD;
      adenovirus, CMV, or EBV infection or refractory viremia that is persistent despite standard&#xD;
      therapy. Infusion of the cellular product will be assessed for safety and efficacy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If a subject shows a partial response, defined as a decrease in viral load of at least 50%&#xD;
      from baseline or 50% improvement of clinical signs and symptoms, or no response, they are&#xD;
      eligible to receive up to 2 additional cellular infusions from the same donor, at a minimum&#xD;
      of 21-day intervals. If the same donor is no longer available, another donor may be&#xD;
      considered for a maximum of 3 total cellular infusions at the discretion of the study PI and&#xD;
      treating physician. A subject will not exceed a maximum of 3 total infusions from 2 donors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are followed for 1 year post initial viral-specific T cell infusion. If subjects&#xD;
      receive additional infusion(s), GvHD and adverse events will be followed for an additional 90&#xD;
      days from last infusion. Data may be abstracted from subjects' medical charts for an&#xD;
      additional 1 year after most recent viral-specific T cell infusion.&#xD;
