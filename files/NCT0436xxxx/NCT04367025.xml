    <textblock>
      For locally advanced gastric cance, neoadjuvant chemotherapy can increase the resectability&#xD;
      of tumor, and finally improve the long-term survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer could be a novel therapy to increase response rate and resectability and reduce&#xD;
      recurrence rate. Camrelizumab（SHR-1210） in this study is a Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal&#xD;
      antibody for injection which has been approved for melanoma and Hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is a single center, open-label, randomized comparative phase II clinical trial to&#xD;
      evaluate safety and efficacy of Camrelizumab in combination with perioperative chemotherapy&#xD;
      in locally advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Differences in T&#xD;
      cell expression were detected by single cell RNA sequencing to screen people who were more&#xD;
      sensitive to immunotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastric cancer is one of the most common malignancies in China with incidence and mortality&#xD;
      both ranking the 2nd among malignancies in China. Surgery is the only possible way to cure&#xD;
      gastric cancer, however, over 80-90% of gastric cancer patients in China are in advanced&#xD;
      stage. Locally advanced gastric cancer could be cured by multi-disciplinary therapies&#xD;
      including surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy can increase the&#xD;
      resectability of tumor, and finally improve the long-term survival. However, the therapeutic&#xD;
      effects remain unsatisfactory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Combination of perioperative PD-1 antibody and chemotherapy for locally advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer could be a novel therapy to increase response rate and resectability and reduce&#xD;
      recurrence rate. Camrelizumab in this study is a Chinese anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibody for&#xD;
      injection which has been approved for melanoma and Hepatocellular carcinoma .This study is a&#xD;
      single center, open-label, randomized comparative phase II clinical trial to evaluate safety&#xD;
      and efficacy of Camrelizumab in combination with perioperative chemotherapy in locally&#xD;
      advanced adenocarcinoma of stomach or gastroesophageal junction. Differences in T cell&#xD;
      expression were detected by single cell RNA sequencing to screen people who were more&#xD;
