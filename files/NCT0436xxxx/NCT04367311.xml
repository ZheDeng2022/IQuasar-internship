  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The vast majority of patients with stage I (tumors ≥ 4cm), IIA, IIB (and select IIIA) NSCLC&#xD;
      are managed with upfront surgery, followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. However, relapse rates&#xD;
      remain high and are primarily due to distant, metastatic disease. Previous meta-analysis&#xD;
      evaluating the use of neo-adjuvant chemotherapy and adjuvant chemotherapy demonstrate a&#xD;
      similar impact on improved disease free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS). The role of&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors has been proven to be effective in the treatment of patients with&#xD;
      advanced NSCLC, regardless of histology and PD-L1 expression. Results from trials evaluating&#xD;
      the use of checkpoint inhibitors alone or in combination with chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting for early stage disease are promising. However, there are no trials evaluating the&#xD;
      role of concomitant chemotherapy and checkpoint inhibitors in the adjuvant setting. In&#xD;
      addition, emerging data supports the use of ctDNA as a promising biomarker for early&#xD;
      detection of minimal residual disease and have indicated that the presence of detectable&#xD;
      ctDNA after surgery for localized lung cancer is correlated with a 90-100% chance for disease&#xD;
      recurrence. Therefore, we propose this current study assessing concomitant chemotherapy plus&#xD;
      Atezolizumab in the adjuvant setting for patients with stage I (tumors ≥ 4cm), IIA, IIB (and&#xD;
      select IIIA) NSCLC who have detectable ctDNA after surgery. The clearance of ctDNA will serve&#xD;
      as a surrogate for long term DFS and OS in this patient population.&#xD;

At each time point, ctDNA detection status (detectable or not detectable) will be determined by CAPP-seq using the Monte Carlo-based ctDNA detection index cutoff point of &lt; 0.05, as described by Newman et al [53, 54]. If ctDNA detection index is &gt; 0.05, ctDNA will be classified as not detected at that time point, whereas if &lt; 0.05 then it will be classified as detected.</description>

             edition with negative margins (R0).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Squamous or non-squamous NSCLC histology. Cancers with a histology of &quot;adenosquamous&quot;&#xD;

          -  Surgery for this lung cancer must be completed &lt;= 60 days prior to starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Must have tissue available to perform prospective correlative testing. Tissue block is&#xD;
             preferred but 10-15 unstained slides (5 μm thick) are also acceptable. If prior PD-L1&#xD;
             results with Dako 22C3 antibody are not available, an additional 5 unstained slides (4&#xD;

             be obtained within 28 days prior to registration.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Females of childbearing potential must have a negative serum pregnancy test within 7&#xD;
             days prior to registration NOTE: Females are considered of childbearing potential&#xD;
             unless they are surgically sterile (have undergone a hysterectomy, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or they are naturally postmenopausal for at least&#xD;
             12 consecutive months&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For women of childbearing potential: agreement to remain abstinent (refrain from&#xD;
             heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods, and agreement to refrain from&#xD;
             donating eggs, as defined below:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Women must remain abstinent or use contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt;&#xD;
                  1% per year during the treatment period and for 5 months after the final dose of&#xD;
                  atezolizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  A woman is considered of childbearing potential if she is postmenarchal, has not&#xD;
                  reached a postmenopausal state (&gt; or equal to 12 continuous months of amenorrhea&#xD;
                  with no identified cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical&#xD;
                  sterilization (removal of ovaries and/or uterus). The definition of childbearing&#xD;
                  potential may be adapted for alignment with local guidelines or requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of &lt; 1% per year include&#xD;
                  bilateral tubal ligation, male sterilization, hormonal contraceptives that&#xD;
                  inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices, and copper&#xD;
                  intrauterine devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraception method must begin starting from the time of informed consent until 5&#xD;
             months after treatment discontinuation.&#xD;

                  must remain abstinent or use a condom during the treatment period and for 5&#xD;
                  months after the last dose of study treatment to avoid exposing the embryo. Men&#xD;
                  must refrain from donating sperm during this same period.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  The reliability of sexual abstinence should be evaluated in relation to the&#xD;
                  duration of the clinical trial and the preferred and usual lifestyle of the&#xD;
                  patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal, or&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  As determined by the enrolling physician or protocol designee, ability of the subject&#xD;
