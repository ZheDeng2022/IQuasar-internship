      The purpose of this study is to evaluate whether sequential treatment with high-flow&#xD;
      humidification therapy apparatus can improve the postoperative recovery and functional status&#xD;
      of patients with invasive mechanical ventilation in ICU after the withdrawal of the&#xD;
      catheter.Inclusion criteria: age 18-95;The hemodynamics were stable, that is, 50 &lt; heart rate&#xD;
      less than 120 beats/min, 90 &lt; systolic blood pressure &lt; 200mmHg, 55 &lt; mean arterial pressure&#xD;
      &lt; 120mmHg.Do not increase the dose of vasopressor for at least 2 hours;Intracranial pressure&#xD;
      was stable and there was no seizure within 24 hours.The breathing condition was stable, that&#xD;
      is, the oxygen satiety of the patient's finger vein was ≥88%, and the breathing frequency was&#xD;
      &gt;10 and&lt; 35 times/min.Exclusion criteria: pregnancy;Acute myocardial infarction.A total of 50&#xD;
      patients who are sequentially treated with high-flow humidification therapy apparatus after&#xD;
      extubation in ICU are randomly assigned. The experimental group receive respiratory&#xD;
      rehabilitation therapy, while the control group only receive routine medical treatment. All&#xD;
      the enrolled patients underwent rehabilitation evaluation and bedside diaphragmatic&#xD;
      ultrasound measurement.This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of the CPLA General&#xD;
      Hospital (project No.2018-212-01). The following clinical datas were recorded for all&#xD;
      patients through the unified database software: The rehabilitation program was formulated&#xD;
      according to the cluster management strategy of ABCDEF and the six-step method of early&#xD;
      activities.All of the patients in monitoring vital signs, every day at hospital group and all&#xD;
      peripheral muscle MRC assessment, 30 s sit stand trial, modified Barthel index, Borg dyspnea&#xD;
      score, arterial blood gas analysis, diaphragm ultrasonic monitoring by the bed, finally the&#xD;
      experimental process on the patients whether using noninvasive ventilator, whether for&#xD;
      endotracheal intubation again, whether to have new complications (pressure sores, aspiration,&#xD;
      thrombosis, etc.) and the patients bed time statistics for the first time. Statistical&#xD;
      analyses were conducted by SPSS 21.0 and a two-tailed P &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;
