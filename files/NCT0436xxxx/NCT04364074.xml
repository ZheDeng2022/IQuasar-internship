  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      One in every two deaths in the United States is caused by cardiovascular disease. Despite&#xD;
      strong mechanistic links established between a diet rich in lipids and the pathogenesis of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease, therapeutic advances have focused on reduction in either ingestion or&#xD;
      synthesis of cholesterol, and reduction in dietary trans and saturated fatty acids and&#xD;
      triglycerides. Even in the setting of aggressive high potency statin therapy and global&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk reduction efforts, most clinical trials reveal a significant residual&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk with, at best, only 30% reduction in major adverse cardiovascular events.&#xD;
      There exists a significant unmet clinical need for identifying novel therapies for the&#xD;
      prevention and treatment of cardiovascular disease. This requires identification of&#xD;
      additional contributory processes to cardiovascular disease pathogenesis, so that&#xD;
      mechanism-based interventions may be developed. Endothelial dysfunction is a pathological&#xD;
      state in which there is systemic inflammation of vascular endothelium with consequent&#xD;
      expression of pro-vasoconstrictive mediators, thrombotic and atherogenic tendencies.&#xD;
      Endothelial dysfunction precedes the development of atherosclerosis and portends an increased&#xD;
      risk of future adverse cardiovascular events. Endothelial dysfunction, therefore, can serve&#xD;
      as a &quot;barometer&quot; of future cardiovascular risk. Measurement of Flow-mediated dilation ( FMD)&#xD;
      is widely accepted as a method to assess vascular endothelial function.&#xD;

      Researchers at MCW have discovered a new pathway that links the type of bacteria present in&#xD;
      the intestines to the severity of heart attacks. This discovery of a relationship between&#xD;
      intestinal bacteria, bacterial metabolites, and severity of heart attacks means that for the&#xD;
      first time, we may be able to determine a person's probability of having a heart attack via&#xD;
      non-conventional risk factors. This may provide opportunities for novel diagnostic tests as&#xD;
      well as a potential for therapeutic intervention. The link between gut microbiota and the&#xD;
      severity of heart attacks may also lead to novel therapeutic approaches (probiotics,&#xD;
      non-absorbable antibiotics) to prevent heart attacks from happening. Our pilot study has&#xD;
      demonstrated that supplementation of Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) for 6 weeks to&#xD;
      adults with a history of coronary artery disease showed improvement in endothelial function.&#xD;
      Whether acute ingestion of a single drink containing Lp299v supplementation favorably impacts&#xD;
      vascular endothelial function is not known. The study proposed will test the hypothesis that&#xD;
      supplementation of Lp299v favorably impacts vascular endothelial function after ingestion of&#xD;
      a single supplement containing Lp299v.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 will determine the acute impact of probiotic supplementation on endothelial&#xD;
      cell function as measured by brachial artery flow mediated dilation (FMD)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 will determine the impact of acute probiotic supplementation on blood&#xD;
      biomarkers for inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 will be to determine the impact of baseline constitution of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota (assessed by stool microbiome) on change in FMD as a result of acute response to&#xD;
      probiotic supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 4 will be to determine the impact of baseline constitution of intestinal&#xD;
      microbiota (assessed by stool microbiome) on change in levels of blood markers for&#xD;
      inflammation as a result of acute response probiotic supplementation.&#xD;
