  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Urinary tract infections (UTI) are an important part of infectious diseases. For some&#xD;
      patients, those infections are recurrent and have many consequences such as altered quality&#xD;
      of life, recurrent symptoms, antibiotics overuse… The primary purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      estimate the proportion of patients in Puy-de-Dôme with recurrent urinary tract infections&#xD;
      among patients with at least one UTI during 2019. The secondary purposes are :&#xD;
      characteristics of patients with recurrent UTI, by sex ; determine predictive factors of&#xD;
      recurrent UTI, by sex ; describe bacterial ecology of recurrent UTI and the proportion of&#xD;
      multi-resistant bacteria.&#xD;
