  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Rationale: In view of patient care, patient characteristics and treatment parameters are&#xD;
      registered for all patients visiting the Mobility Clinic of the University Medical Center&#xD;
      Utrecht for orthopaedic knee treatment. Patients also fill out questionnaires for function,&#xD;
      pain and mobility of the knee, before and after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The main objective of this registry is to collect patient characteristics and&#xD;
      treatment parameters together with data from the questionnaires in a database. This knee&#xD;
      registry can be used for future research questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: This is a longitudinal observational registry.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: All patients that visit the Mobility Clinic will be asked to participate in&#xD;
      the knee registry. Patients that meet one or more of the following criteria will be excluded:&#xD;
      are below the age of 16, not able or willing to sign the broad consent form, not being able&#xD;
      to read and understand Dutch language, or receiving medical treatment for their knee&#xD;
      elsewhere.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: Data will be collected for future research for which the&#xD;
      purpose is not known at this time. When new research will be conducted, study parameters will&#xD;
      be set. A study application has to be submitted to the institutional ethical review board of&#xD;
      the University Medical Center Utrecht. Patients do not need to be asked permission for the&#xD;
      use of their data for each study individually. Only when additional information is needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The burden for patients to participate in this registry is minimal and consists&#xD;
      of time. Any future results may be beneficial for patients. Participation or refusal to&#xD;
      participate in the registry has no consequences for their treatment.&#xD;

    <description>The EQ-5D-5L is a questionnaire about the quality of life on a scale of 0-100 and has 5 dimensions, each dimension has 5 levels. A higher score indicates a higher health utility. The EQ VAS records the patient's self-rated health on a vertical visual analogue scale, where the endpoints are labelled 'The best health you can imagine' and 'The worst health you can imagine'. The VAS can be used as a quantitative measure of health outcome that reflect the patient's own judgement.</description>
