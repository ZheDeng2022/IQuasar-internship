      This study plans to enroll 5 patients to assess the safety of C-TCR055. Subjects who meet the&#xD;
      eligibility criteria will receive a single dose of C-TCR055 injection, and will be followed&#xD;
      up post treatment for safety monitoring. The follow up period will last 12 months.&#xD;
