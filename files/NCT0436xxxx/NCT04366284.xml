  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare three different ways to deploy a clinician-decision&#xD;
      support platform called NOCTEM COAST among behavioral health care providers who encounter&#xD;
      patients with insomnia.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Insomnia and other sleep disorders are highly prevalent among military service members and&#xD;
      compromise readiness, health, and performance; increase the risk of injury; and are&#xD;
      associated with astronomical healthcare costs. The first-line treatment recommended for&#xD;
      insomnia is cognitive-behavioral treatment for insomnia (CBTI). However, the large number of&#xD;
      service members who are in need of this treatment outnumber the clinicians who are experts in&#xD;
      behavioral sleep medicine and who currently provide this intervention in a cost-efficient&#xD;
      manner and in a way that is acceptable and accessible to patients and clinicians. To address&#xD;
      this challenge and scale the delivery and access to evidence-based behavioral sleep&#xD;
      interventions, NOCTEM™ has developed a digital health platform called COAST (Clinician&#xD;
      Operated Assistive Sleep Technology). However, the most effective way to implement the use of&#xD;
      digital sleep health technology, and its comparative impact on patient outcomes, remain to be&#xD;
      determined. Therefore, this trial will compare three different ways to deploy the NOCTEM™&#xD;
      platform among behavioral health care providers who encounter patients with insomnia.&#xD;
      Specifically, the study will evaluate and compare without external or internal support&#xD;
      (NOCTEM), with external support (i.e., facilitation) offered by the NOCTEM team (NOCTEM+EF),&#xD;
      and with external support and internal support from local champions (NOCTEM+EF/IF). The trial&#xD;
      will also compare the overall magnitude of improvements in insomnia among patients who use&#xD;
      the NOCTEM app with their provider.&#xD;
