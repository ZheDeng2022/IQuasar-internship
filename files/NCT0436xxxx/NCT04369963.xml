  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers at Seattle Children's Research Institute want to find ways to understand&#xD;
      gastrointestinal disease such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD), Irritable Bowel Syndrome&#xD;
      (IBS) and Graft-Versus-Host-Disease (GVHD). We want to compare healthy cells from the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract to cells from people with gastrointestinal diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are looking for healthy participants 18-25 with no gastrointestinal&#xD;
      symptoms to volunteer to have an upper and lower endoscopy and to collect blood and stool&#xD;
      samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hope the information gathered in this study will help to better predict and&#xD;
      treat these diseases in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants who join the study will complete the following activities:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1 hour appointment at Seattle Children's Hospital to determine eligibility Blood Draw Upper&#xD;
      and Lower Endoscopy with tissue biopsies Stool Sample collection Participants will get $600&#xD;
      to thank them for their time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may be eligible for this study if they meet the following requirements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 -25 years of age Do not have any abdominal symptoms (vomiting, diarrhea or abdominal pain)&#xD;
      Are not on any medications (vitamins and birth control are OK) Have a BMI (body mass index)&#xD;
      between 20-25 kg/m^2 Please note: Interested participants will have a 30 minute phone call&#xD;
      with the study team and subsequent 1 hour appointment at Seattle Children's to determine if&#xD;
      they meet all of the eligibility criteria.&#xD;

      This study will enroll a cohort of healthy individuals age 18-25 to volunteer for an&#xD;
      esophagogastroduodenoscopy and colonoscopy and will collect of gastrointestinal tissue biopsy&#xD;
      samples, blood and stool samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Procedures include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening questionnaires&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical records review&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Height, weight, blood pressure and temperature measurements&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Collection of urine sample for pregnancy test and banking&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood sample up to 50ccs(volume based on weight)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stool sample&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  GI tissue from endoscopy (4-16 biopsies collected from esophagogastroduodenoscopy, 4 -16&#xD;
           biopsies collected from colonoscopy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data to be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographics&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pregnancy test results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endoscopy results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pathology results&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical data related to endoscopy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical lab values&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will enroll 10 participants who meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age 18-25&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No signs or symptoms of present illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  No known history of chronic illness&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Not on any medications other than birth control or vitamin supplementation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI between 10-25 kg/m^2&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Negative pregnancy test result&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective/ Purpose:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The samples and information collected from this cohort will be used to understand the mucosal&#xD;
      immunity of the gastrointestinal tract in individuals without gastrointestinal problems or&#xD;
      history of chronic disease. This information will be used to study the immunology of diseases&#xD;
      such as Inflammatory Bowel Disease, Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders and Graft vs. Host&#xD;
      Disease.&#xD;
