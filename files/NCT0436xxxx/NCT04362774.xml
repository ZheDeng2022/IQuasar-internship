      A prospective, multicenter, open-label, post-approval study of the safety and effectiveness&#xD;
      of ORBERA36 as a 12-month adjunct to weight reduction for obese adults (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2 and&#xD;
      BMI ≤ 50 kg/m2) or for pre-surgical weight reduction in obese and super-obese adults (BMI ≥&#xD;
      40 kg/m2 or ≥ 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, multicenter, open label study of the safety and effectiveness of&#xD;
      ORBERA365™ for use as an adjunct to behavioral modification for obese adults (BMI ≥ 27 kg/m2&#xD;
      and BMI ≤ 50 kg/m2) or for pre-surgical weight reduction in obese and super-obese adults (BMI&#xD;
      ≥ 40 kg/m2 or ≥ 35 kg/m2 with comorbidities). All study subjects will participate in a&#xD;
      behavioral modification program for 52 weeks, which will include a low calorie diet as well&#xD;
      as nutritional and behavior modification counseling. Subjects will have ORBERA365™ placed for&#xD;
      up to 52 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations while on treatment will be performed at baseline (pre-placement), Day 0&#xD;
      (ORBERA365 placement) and during monthly clinic visits during the 1st 6 months of device&#xD;
      therapy and at months 9 and ORBERA365 removal. All subjects will have a final study visit at&#xD;
      12 months, or study exit, whichever comes first. Device removal will occur at 52 unless&#xD;
      removed early by subject request and/or physician recommendation. Reasons for early removal&#xD;
      may include, but are not limited to, adverse events, subject dissatisfaction or achievement&#xD;
      of weight loss goal.&#xD;
