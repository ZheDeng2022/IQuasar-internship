      Background and study aims: Management of esophago-jejunal anastomotic leackages (EJAL) after&#xD;
      gastric resections is challenging. Endoscopic negative pressure therapy (ENPT) is an emerging&#xD;
      effective tool for treatment of gastrointestinal and anastomotic leaks. We use ENPT for EJAL&#xD;
      after oncological gastric resections as first line therapy since 2018. The aim of the study&#xD;
      was to present our results with this strategy by a case series.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods: Eight patients were treated with ENPT for EJAL after oncological&#xD;
      gastric resections between 01.2018 and 12.2019. A retrospective analysis of patient's and&#xD;
      therapy related data was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: Time of detection was 6.25 ± 2.54 days after surgery. After 15.63 ± 9.92 days of&#xD;
      ENPT, 6.43 ± 3.66 endoscopies and 38.75 ± 17.35 days of hospitalization, endoscopic treatment&#xD;
      with ENPT combined with minimal-surgery for sepsis-control was effective in seven of eight&#xD;
      patients. In one patients treatment was changed to Stent-based therapy combined with further&#xD;
      surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusions: ENPT is one step in the complication management of patients with anastomotic&#xD;
      insufficiencies after oncological gastric resections. It can be recommended in combination&#xD;
      with minimal invasive surgery for sepsis-control. Success of ENPT for EJAL seams to be&#xD;
      dependent on the age and size of the insufficiency and the clinical situation of the patient.&#xD;

      Endoscopic negative pressure therapy (ENPT):&#xD;
&#xD;
      OPD: The commercially available Eso-SPONGE® System (B. Braun Melsungen AG, Melsungen,&#xD;
      Germany) was used for endoluminal vacuum therapy. For positioning the OPD in loop-technique a&#xD;
      loop (MersileneTM, Polyester, 4 Ph. Eur., Ethicon®, Norderstedt, Germany) is fixed at the&#xD;
      distal end of the drainage, gripped with an endoscopic grasper and placed under endoscopic&#xD;
      view. Endoscopic placement took place via oral intubation of the esophagus with finally&#xD;
      oro-nasal redirection and fixation with plasters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OFD: The OFD for endoluminal therapy is handmade, as previously described, by wrapping a thin&#xD;
      open-pore double-layered drainage film (Suprasorb® CNP, Drainage Film; Lohmann &amp; Rauscher&#xD;
      International GmbH &amp; Co.KG, Rengsdorf, Germany) on the distal end of a small caliber redon&#xD;
      drain, a gastric tube or the gastric segment of a naso-jejunal feeding tube (Freka®&#xD;
      Trelumina, Fresenius Kabi Deutschland GmbH, Bad Homburg Germany). Sutures (MersileneTM,&#xD;
      Polyester, 4 Ph. Eur., Ethicon®, Norderstedt, Germany) were used for the fixation of the&#xD;
      drainage film around the tube. Drain insertion took place via nasal positioning and&#xD;
      endoscopic guiding with grasper. Venting tubes in tri-lumen enteral feeding tubes has to be&#xD;
      closed for ENPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Controlled Negative Pressure: A continuous vacuum of -125 mmHg is generated by electronic&#xD;
      vacuum devices (KCI V.A.C. Ulta or V.A.C. Freedom; KCI USA Inc., San Antonio, TX, USA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedural informations: In patients with suspected EJAL first an index endoscopy under&#xD;
      general anesthesia with endotracheal intubation was indicated. Standard gastroscopes with&#xD;
      outer diameter of 9.8mm were used with carbon dioxide insufflation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of a anastomotic leak were endoscopic or radiological dehiscences at the&#xD;
      esophagojejunostomy with extravasation of fluids and gas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Decision criteria for placement of OPD or OFD were the defect size, radiological findings and&#xD;
      clinical situation of the patient. A CT scan in patients with suspected EJAL was done in all&#xD;
      cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Re-endoscopy was performed after 3-7 days. In the case of persisting leak or in the case of&#xD;
      uncertainty, the new ENPT system was re-inserted and treatment was continued. In patients&#xD;
      with OPD change interval was 3-4 days, in patients treated with OFD interval was longer up to&#xD;
      7 days. Success was defined as complete closure of the perforation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients with a good clinical situation with endoluminale placed OFD swallow of liquids is&#xD;
      allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Database:&#xD;
&#xD;
      An analysis was performed using SPSS v. 24.0.0.1 (IBM, Armonk, NY, USA). Data were presented&#xD;
      as means ± SD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results Eight patients (4 females and 4 males with a mean age of 61.39 ± 12.92 years) were&#xD;
      treated with ENPT for EJL. Patient's characteristics are presented in Table 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mean time point of diagnosis the EJAL was day 6.25 ± 2.54 after resection. Three patients&#xD;
      were treated at the ICU at the time of diagnosis of the EJAL. Symptoms that caused suspicion&#xD;
      of EJAL were respiratory insufficiency, conspicuous secretion via drains, fever, and elevated&#xD;
      inflammatory markers. All patients were treated and observed on ICU after detection an start&#xD;
      of ENPT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings of the index endoscopy varied strongly. Circumscribed insufficiencies, large&#xD;
      leakages with secretion of putrid fluids or fibrin coated anastomosis with exposed clamps&#xD;
      were seen. In Figure 1 and 2 examples of endoscopic finding during the index endoscopy are&#xD;
      presented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      First treatment mode in all patients with EJAL was endoluminale ENPT. In five patients ENPT&#xD;
      was performed with OPD and in three patients with OFD. In one obese patient with a complete&#xD;
      anastomotic avulsion ENPT was changed to SEMS-therapy. Treatment characteristics are&#xD;
      summarized in Table 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to achieve sepsis control additional surgery was indicated in seven of eight&#xD;
      patients. Number of needed re-operations varied strongly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral feeding was established in all patients. Enteral feeding was ensured by nutrition&#xD;
      tubes combined with ENPT through OFD in five patients and via needle catheter jejunostomy in&#xD;
      three patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In seven patients treated with ENPT for EJAL therapy combined with surgery for sepsis control&#xD;
      was successful. In five final endoscopic reports any dehiscences or insufficiencies were&#xD;
      characterized and in two reports small and clean insufficiencies with good wound granulation&#xD;
      were described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A later endoscopic intervention of a post-treatment stenosis of the anastomosis was not&#xD;
      detected in the analyzed patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion ENPT is a promising tool for treating EJAL. Furthermore, comparative studies&#xD;
      between ENPT and other endoscopic treatment options for EJAL are needed to determine the best&#xD;
      management options and indications for combined surgical interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We recommend ENPT in endoluminal position in patients who suffered from EJAL combined with&#xD;
      additional surgery if required to treat pleural or abdominal septic collections.&#xD;
