  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The complicated schedules for administering topical steroid eye drops combined with&#xD;
      forgetfulness and physical difficulties instilling the drops may compromise compliance; which&#xD;
      in turn could increase the risk for secondary complications such as PME post-cataract&#xD;
      surgery, especially in a high-risk diabetic population. Dextenza, a sustained- release&#xD;
      steroid insert, could help preclude adherence difficulties and provide better&#xD;
      bioavailability, being as effective as, or more effective than steroid drops in preventing&#xD;
      PME. The aim of this study is to assess the incidence of PME in diabetic patients undergoing&#xD;
      cataract surgery when comparing the Dextenza insert to topical prednisolone acetate 1% drops.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This prospective, open-label, single-center, randomized, fellow-eye, investigator-sponsored&#xD;
      clinical study seeks to investigate the incidence of PME in diabetic patients with any level&#xD;
      of background diabetic retinopathy undergoing cataract surgery treated with a 0.4mg&#xD;
      dexamethasone intracanalicular insert when compared to standard of care prednisolone acetate&#xD;
      1% QID/1 week, TID/ 1 week, BID/ 1 week, QD/1 week. Topical NSAIDs will not be used in this&#xD;
      study and all patients will receive an intracameral injection of moxifloxacin at the end of&#xD;
      the surgical procedure. After screening a patient for inclusion and exclusion criteria, and&#xD;
      gaining informed consent, each eye will undergo cataract surgery on separate days. The second&#xD;
      eye will be operated on within 60 days of the first eye's surgery. One eye will be randomized&#xD;
      to receive the dexamethasone insert using a coin flip. The other eye will be prescribed a&#xD;
      prednisolone acetate 0.1% eye drop QID/ 1 week, TID/ 1 week, BID/1 week, QD/ 1 week regimen.&#xD;
      The dexamethasone insert will be placed 2-4 days before surgery (Day -4 to Day-2) and those&#xD;
      randomized to receive prednisolone acetate will start 2-4 days before surgery. After surgery,&#xD;
      each eye will be followed for a period of approximately 60 days, consisting of four post-op&#xD;
      follow-up visits (eight total post-op visits per patient). Primary and secondary endpoints&#xD;
      will be assessed alongside standard-of-care procedures at all study visits . Adjusting for&#xD;
      the enrollment period, the study will last a total of approximately 12 months.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This prospective study will use a fellow-eye design for 30 participants, summing to 60 eyes total. All eyes will receive cataract surgery. Per participant, one eye will be randomized to receive DEXTENZAÂ® insertion at the end of the surgery, while the other eye will be assigned to a standard of care prednisolone acetate 1% eye drop regimen.</intervention_model_description>
