      Observational study about children with cleft palate from surgery to pre-adolescence&#xD;
      :Description of language development and hearing profile.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      &quot;Children with cleft palates are prone to complications that can impact on their overall&#xD;
      development. Several factors such as serous otitis media or abnormal musculature of the velum&#xD;
      can have consequences on hearing and language. In this context, it seems important to&#xD;
      describe the evolution of this disease after surgery to better anticipate complications and&#xD;
      improve their subsequent management. The aim of this study is to describe the hearing profile&#xD;
      and language development of children with cleft palate from surgery to pre-adolescence. The&#xD;
      hearing profile is assessed though an audiogram once or twice a year during the annual&#xD;
      follow-up with the referring surgeon. Language development is assessed by the intelligibility&#xD;
      scale, a validated questionnaire. This study will allow identification of : - predictive&#xD;
      criteria for poor hearing and poor language development; - risk groups: type of cleft,&#xD;
      medical history, genetic background, etc; - Level of speech disorder other than&#xD;
      intelligibility: rhinolalia, eagerness for communication; - Other factors in the history of&#xD;
      the disease: âge at surgery ; - history of chronic otitis media, ventilation tube placements;&#xD;
      - nasalization and language disorder; - speech-language pathology; - History of hearing&#xD;
      impairment; - age of first words; - Other ENT clinical history; - History of malformations; -&#xD;
      Socio-economic level of the household; - Mother's language / number of languages spoken at&#xD;
      home. This is a retrospective and prospective cohort study. Children aged 5 to 11 with a&#xD;
      cleft palate operated on for a veloplasty at Robert Debré Hospital between 2008 and 2014 were&#xD;
      included in the study between 2008 and 2014.&#xD;
