      SUMMARY Contextualization The knee is one of the joints that has more injuries reports in&#xD;
      men's soccer. Nowadays there are different injury prevention protocols, but none of them&#xD;
      specifically focus on the knee joint. Numerous studies have shown that proprioceptive work is&#xD;
      more effective than traditional protocols.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective This study aims to test the effects of a proprioceptive exercise program included&#xD;
      as part of warm-up or cool-down in preventing knee injuries and muscle performance in youth&#xD;
      soccer players Methodology This is a quasi-experimental study with three intervention groups.&#xD;
      One group will be control, another group will be experimental with the intervention in the&#xD;
      warm-up phase, and another one experimental group with the intervention in the cool-down&#xD;
      phase. The independent variable will be the proprioceptive exercises, the dependent variables&#xD;
      will be the dynamic balance measured with the Y Balance Test, and the muscular performance&#xD;
      measured with Counter Movement Jump and the 40m sprint. The confounding variables will be&#xD;
      age, height, weight, and body mass index (BMI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Soccer is a high intensity sport, characterized by continuous changes of direction and high&#xD;
      load unipodal actions, which generates high levels of stress in the lower limbs, particularly&#xD;
      in the knees . Consequently, there is a high rate of lower limb injury in men's soccer, with&#xD;
      the knee being one of the most frequent injured joint, with an average of 14% of injury&#xD;
      records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are varied preventive strategies for this type of injury which are usually included in&#xD;
      the warm-up. Popular protocols like FIFA 11+, HarmonKnee, Elis and Rosembaum, Prevent Injury&#xD;
      and Enhance Performance Program, include strength exercises, stretching, balance and&#xD;
      plyometry; and other protocols focus exclusively on plyometric exercises or strength&#xD;
      exercises in soccer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of these protocols usually show proprioception as one of the factors to be&#xD;
      improved since it has been observed that it is a determining element in the prevention of&#xD;
      injuries. Loss of proprioception has been shown to compromise motor and postural control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Warm-up can benefit proprioception, stability and, thus, injury prevention. There are several&#xD;
      recent studies showing that warm-up programs focused on proprioception are more successful at&#xD;
      preventing injuries than traditional warm-ups in athletes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, current protocols, such as those proposed by the FIFA Medical and Research&#xD;
      Center (F-MARC) and Hubscher, demand to study in a more isolated way which components of&#xD;
      these programs are the most effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another important feature of these programs is the time of training in which they are&#xD;
      included. Although most of the studies consider more appropriate to carry them out as part of&#xD;
      the warm-up, there is no consensus among the authors. Currently there is great controversy&#xD;
      due to the lack of studies evaluating and comparing the effects of this type of program on&#xD;
      key prevention parameters such as postural stability or lower limb strength as they are&#xD;
      included before or after training. Studies that have analyzed the effects of performing&#xD;
      preventive programs after training have shown similar gains in strength parameters, although&#xD;
      the components of the program were mostly eccentric exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, to our knowledge, there are no studies so far comparing the effects of a preventive&#xD;
      program based on postural stability exercises included before or after the main part of&#xD;
      soccer training. For this reason, it is necessary to carry out a study that evaluates the&#xD;
      effectiveness of a proprioceptive exercises program in the injurious incidence of the knee,&#xD;
      postural stability and muscular performance of youth soccer players, comparing these effects&#xD;
      according to the inclusion of this program as part of the warm-up or part of the cool-down of&#xD;
      the training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. -To compare the effects of a proprioceptive balance and force-explosive exercise program&#xD;
           included in the warm-up phase or cool-down phase on the knee injuries incidence in youth&#xD;
           soccer players.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. -To assess the effects of a proprioceptive exercise program of balance and strength on&#xD;
           the postural stability and muscular performance of youth soccer players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODOLOGY Study design This quasi-experimental study was carried out with 3 intervention&#xD;
      groups. The study will be carried out on soccer teams from the Community of Madrid. In each&#xD;
      team there will be 3 intervention subgroups. Each team is divided into: a control group (CG),&#xD;
      an experimental group in which the intervention will be performed in the warm-up phase (EG1)&#xD;
      and an experimental group in which the intervention will be carried out in the coool-down&#xD;
      phase. after the training or match (EG2). The CG will perform the training routine that the&#xD;
      team used to do; the EG1 will execute the warm-up routine that the team normally do plus the&#xD;
      balance exercises of the HarmoKnee program; and the EG2 will do the warm-up routine they used&#xD;
      to do at the training or game, plus, to finish, perform the balance exercises of the&#xD;
      Harmoknee program to cool-down.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified depending on the soccer club, guaranteeing the blinding of&#xD;
      the assignment sequence by the distribution of opaque or sealed letters. Study will start on&#xD;
      preseason, that take place on January 2020. Randomization and intervention will be carried&#xD;
      out in each club's soccer pitch. The exposition dedicated to the importance of training&#xD;
      proprioception at injury prevention and muscular performance to the primarily responsable&#xD;
      doctors and sport managers as the measurement taking to the players will be done the first&#xD;
      day of the team training. The same day, the multi-modal, HarmoKnee based-on balance exercises&#xD;
      that the experimental groups must do will be shown and taught. Intervention will last 8&#xD;
      weeks. Physiotherapists will examine the execution of the exercises corresponding to each&#xD;
      program in each training day or match to be able to make corrections if necessary and assure&#xD;
      the compliance to the injury prevention program. Measurements will be taken after the&#xD;
      intervention and a 1-month after the intervention a third and last measurement will be done.&#xD;
      The measurements the physiotherapists will take are: age, weight, height, body mass index&#xD;
      (BMI). Additionally, players will take these following tests, which will be taken before,&#xD;
      after, and one month after the intervention: Y balance Test, Counter Movement Jump and 40-m&#xD;
      Sprint Performance. Since the beginning of the intervention (January 2020) until the past 3&#xD;
      months a weekly register of the number of knee injuries that will be written in a Word&#xD;
      document and will be verified in person by the investigators and the medical service of the&#xD;
      team. Any missing time of training or any physical complaint (with no need of medical&#xD;
      assistance) by a player that comes of a match/ training will be considered as an injury.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The consensus found in the medical literature to classify the injury gravity - and the most&#xD;
      used criteria for it in similar studies to this (it is time-based: (on number of days) from&#xD;
      the moment that the injury occurs to the day that the player is able to fully return to&#xD;
      training and playing matches. The classification is described on the next table (Table 1):&#xD;
&#xD;
      TABLE 1. INJURY CLASSIFICATION DEFINITION INJURY DURATION Slight discomfort 0 days Minimum&#xD;
      injury 1-3 days Mild injury 4-7 days Moderate injury 8-28 days Severe injury &lt; 28 days&#xD;
      Injuries that cause the end of the sportive career&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants Sample size calculation was estimated using GiPower 3.1.9.2., Windows version,&#xD;
      using an ANOVA statistical test of repeated measures with an error α of 0,5, a potency of&#xD;
      0,95 for the 3 groups and 3 types of measurements with a result of 36 subjects, which effect&#xD;
      size will be 0,7. Despite this, our objective will be to recruit a maximum of 60 subjects,&#xD;
      that is to say, our sample will be comprehended between 36 and 60 subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The recruitment will apply for soccer teams from Madrid Community. Ethical Aspects Before&#xD;
      entering on the experimental phase, subjects will be informed of the intervention details.&#xD;
      Revocation of study participation has been included in a final paragraph at the informed&#xD;
      consent form. Study will be carried out following the Helsinki Declaration principles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Obtained data will be confidential (by anonymity, a codification system and safekeeping). In&#xD;
      addition, they will always be presented with due caution and guarantees, complying with the&#xD;
      Organic Law 15/1999, of December 13th, on protection of personal data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Codification procedure will be done by using the player's licence federation number, in a way&#xD;
      of avoiding the manipulation of personal data. In the case where personal data manipulation&#xD;
      will be needed, it will be the club coaches who provide that information, instead of being&#xD;
      the investigators the ones who are in possession of that information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting the intervention, presidents, coaches, club's technical group, players and&#xD;
      their parents (when needed) will be informed of the investigation project. For this purpose,&#xD;
      investigators will make an exposition to the to the primarily responsable doctors and sport&#xD;
      managers about the importance of injury prevention. Along the first session initial&#xD;
      measurements and earlier mentioned tests will be taken. Plus, an information paper will be&#xD;
      handed over the players , and another one for their parents and players of legal age along an&#xD;
      informed consent form for the voluntary participation to the study (to the players plus, in&#xD;
      the case they are minors, to theirs parents). Once informed consent form is signed by the&#xD;
      players and their parents when needed, the measure register will begin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initial measures that will be used as confounding variables are: height (measured with a&#xD;
      portable stadiometer SECA 217 in centimeters (cm)), weight (measured by a weight machine&#xD;
      Tanita BC-545N in kilograms (kg)), BMI (the ratio of a person's weight (kg) to his or her&#xD;
      height (m) squared), and age (years). Multimodal exercises are the independent variable.&#xD;
      Dependent variables will be postural stability (Y Balance Test), lower limb strength (Counter&#xD;
      Movement Jump) and speed (40 metre Sprint Performance). Tests will be taken after the teams&#xD;
      have warmed-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Y balance test YBT is an instrument for functional evaluation for lower limb derived from&#xD;
      Star Excursion Balance Test. To prepare this test, a &quot;Y&quot; letter is drawn on the ground with&#xD;
      an adhesive band. The length on each of the three directions will be of 1,5 meters; there&#xD;
      will be 90º between postero-medial axis (PMA) and postero-lateral axis (PLA); 135º between&#xD;
      the PMA and anterior axis (AA) and 135º between AA and PLA . One of the lower limbs must be&#xD;
      maintained in the convergence of those three directions and the other one must try to search&#xD;
      for the anterior, postero-medial and postero-lateral Y directions. To do this test each&#xD;
      individual must repeat 7 times the &quot;Y&quot;, rest for 30 seconds between repetitions, and for limb&#xD;
      changing, rest for a minute. 6 of 7 repetitions are for training and the measurement is taken&#xD;
      on the seventh repetition. The execution of this test will be performed in unipodal standing,&#xD;
      hands on waist, while the participant avoids loosing balance or stepping on the adhesive band&#xD;
      with the &quot;reaching&quot; foot and keeps looking to an anterior direction . The measures to take&#xD;
      will be: the distance the player has reached in each direction in centimeters, the length of&#xD;
      the assessed lower limb (from anterior superior iliac spine to medial malleolus) in&#xD;
      centimeters. After taking this measures the formula to be fulfilled will be: the result of&#xD;
      the maximum distance the individual has reached divided by the length, multiplied by&#xD;
      100[(maximum distance in one of the directions/lower limb length) * 100]. This is the way to&#xD;
      obtain the maximum length percentage. To accomplish reliable results, measures will be taken&#xD;
      by 2 physiotherapists: each one will obtain the measures independently, to compare them&#xD;
      afterwards, and obtain the IC of the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counter movement jump CMJ is a vertical jump from a static and standing position. To execute&#xD;
      the jump the individual must start from a 90º flex-extension position. The person being&#xD;
      evaluated must place the hands on the hips, put his/her feet in a plantar flexion, and avoid&#xD;
      to flex his/her knees or arching the back during the jump. The measurement will be done by&#xD;
      using the mobile application MyJump2. The result is the height of the jump, measured in&#xD;
      centimeters (cm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      40m sprint performance The players will make 2 maximum efforts of 40 metre sprint, resting 5&#xD;
      minutes between both sprints. It starts from a crouch position, with a hand contacting the&#xD;
      ground. Both sprints will be evaluated with the mobile application MySprint . The result will&#xD;
      be the speed in meters per second (m/s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once data is registered, randomization with opaque letters will start. Proprioceptive&#xD;
      exercises program Proprioception exercises will be the next: antero-posterior bipodal&#xD;
      horizontal jump, unipodal lateral jump, antero-posterior unipodal horizontal jump and bipodal&#xD;
      vertical jump with or without ball. The exercises will be repeted in two sets. The resting&#xD;
      will always be of 2 minutes between exercises and 1 minute between sets of exercises.&#xD;
      Exercises will be repeated three times a week (Tabla 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To select the exercises, authors have taken into account designs of programs done by previous&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TABLE 2. PROPRIOCEPTIVE EXERCISES PROGRAM&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - Antero-posterior bipodal horizontal jump: Players will jump forward and backward with&#xD;
           both feet together, keeping their hands on their waists for 30 seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - Unipodal lateral jump: Players will perform single-leg lateral jump on both sides of a&#xD;
           previously drawn line on the ground, and keeping their hands on their waists for 30&#xD;
           seconds per limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - Antero-posterior unipodal horizontal jump: Players will jump forward and backward with&#xD;
           one foot, keeping their hands on their waists for 30 seconds per limb.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - Bipodal vertical jump with or whitout ball: Players will perform vertical jumps with&#xD;
           both feet carrying a ball in their hands (this added difficulty will be optional) for 30&#xD;
           seconds&#xD;
&#xD;
      Injury register Once a week, a knee injuries register will be written. It will be done by&#xD;
      phoning the club's coach. Number of knee injuries will be registered in the ANNEX II Table.&#xD;
      This register will record the number of new injuries that may occur each week, giving that&#xD;
      number an absolute value. Also, it will differentiate between right or left leg.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The design section of the study gives the details about what is considered a knee injury in&#xD;
      soccer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Data will be organized and analyzed with SPSS 18.00 version for Windows&#xD;
      (IBM, Armonk, NY, EE.UU.). Statistical Significance level will be considered in a value of α=&#xD;
      0.05. In this study, according with the Saphiro Wilk test, in no case there won't be a number&#xD;
      of subjects (n) higher or equal to 30 per group. Then, a normal contrast must be done. We&#xD;
      will verify the normality of the main variables using the Shapiro-Wilk test. Plus, a&#xD;
      descriptive analysis of the data will be done providing the mean +/- Standard Deviation (SD)&#xD;
      of the normally distributed variables and median and interquartile ranges (Q1 and Q3) of the&#xD;
      non-normally distributed varibles. Both independent variable and dependent variables are&#xD;
      cuantitative. To establish intragroup comparatives of the three measurements (before&#xD;
      intervention, after intervention, at week 8; and a 1 month post-intervention one): if the&#xD;
      variable to manage is cuantitative and it adjusts to the normal distribution, ANOVA will be&#xD;
      used on repeated measures, complemented with comparative tests by pairs of measures as Simple&#xD;
      and Helmert contrasts. If the variable to manage is quantitative but doesn't adjust to normal&#xD;
      distribution, ANOVA Friedman's test will be used, also complemented with comparative tests&#xD;
      done by pairs of measures. To establish intergroup comparisons of each dependent variable: if&#xD;
      dependent variable is normal, lineal regression or Pearson correlation coefficient will be&#xD;
      used; if it is not normal, we will use Spearman's rank correlation coefficient or Kendall's&#xD;
      Tau correlation coefficient. Variance homogeneity between groups will be studied using&#xD;
      Levene's test for age, height, weight and BMI. To complete this analysis, effect size was&#xD;
      calculated making use of Cohen's kappa coefficient (d) and confidence intervals at 95%.&#xD;
