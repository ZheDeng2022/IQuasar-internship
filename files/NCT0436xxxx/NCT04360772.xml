  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Corticotherapy is widely used in auto-immune diseases. If induced immunosuppression by&#xD;
      corticosteroids is well admitted, it's currently not possible to determine individual risk of&#xD;
      infection. Thus, the development of new biomarkers able to reflect immunological status under&#xD;
      immunosuppressive treatments is needed. It would help identifying patients who would benefit&#xD;
      from adapted treatment protocols or infectious prophylaxis. In this field, the mHLA-DR&#xD;
      (monocyte Human Leukocyte Antigen-DR) has shown encouraging results. However, it has never&#xD;
      been used in patients treated by immunosuppressive therapies. The investigators aim to&#xD;
      describe changes induced by corticosteroids in mHLA-DR expression in vivo. To achieve this&#xD;
      goal, the investigators will measure mHLA-DR before treatment, after 1 months, 3 months and 6&#xD;
      months of treatment. Finally, the investigators will look for correlation between the level&#xD;
      of expression of mHLA-DR and the cumulated dose of corticosteroids administered.&#xD;
