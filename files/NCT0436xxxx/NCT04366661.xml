  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is a global problem. Worldwide, 1.2 million people die of lung cancer each year.&#xD;
      In Iraq, lung cancer is the most common malignancy after breast cancer and the leading cause&#xD;
      of cancer-related death. Tobacco smoking plays a major role in lung cancer; it is reported in&#xD;
      85-90% of lung cancer patients yet environmental tobacco smoke, environmental and domestic&#xD;
      air pollution, work-related risk factors, radon exposure, and viruses may also have an impact&#xD;
      on lung cancer incidence rates. Early detection of the disease before patients develop&#xD;
      symptoms considers the best way to improve patient outcomes. IT LUCAS is designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the utility of low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) screening in early detection and&#xD;
      management of lung cancer in high-risk people.&#xD;

      Background Lung cancer is a global problem. Worldwide, 1.2 million people die of lung cancer&#xD;
      each year. In Iraq, lung cancer is the most common malignancy after breast cancer and the&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer-related death. Tobacco smoking plays a major role in lung cancer; it&#xD;
      is reported in 85-90% of lung cancer patients yet environmental tobacco smoke, environmental&#xD;
      and domestic air pollution, work-related risk factors, radon exposure, and viruses may also&#xD;
      have an impact on lung cancer incidence rates. Early detection of the disease before patients&#xD;
      develop symptoms considers the best way to improve patient outcomes. Screening for lung&#xD;
      cancer using low dose computed tomography (LDCT) has been the subject of research studies&#xD;
      since the 1990s. It has been reported to be superior to CXR and septum cytology for small&#xD;
      tumors detection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study IT LUCAS is designed to evaluate the utility of LDCT screening in early&#xD;
      detection and management of lung cancer in high-risk people in Iraq.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design 500 healthy participants aged 50-75 years with a history of smoking of at least&#xD;
      30 pack year of smoking were recruited from Ministries of Oil and Transport. They were&#xD;
      offered Low dose CT of the chest. Nodules with suspicious (Lung RADs 4A or 4B) findings were&#xD;
      classified as positive and referred to the Respiratory Department for further workup and&#xD;
      biopsy. Nodules with Lung RADS 3 features are reviewed after 6 months while those with Lung&#xD;
      RADS 2 offered a LDCT after 12 months.&#xD;
