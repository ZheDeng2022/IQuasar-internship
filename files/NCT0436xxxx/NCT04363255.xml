  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our aim in this study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of etoposide combined with&#xD;
      cisplatin or carboplatin (EC/EP) chemotherapy regimens followed by toripalimab combined with&#xD;
      anlotinib for maintenance in extensive small cell lung cancer(ES-SCLC).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer is the most leading malignant tumor, among which small cell lung cancer accounts&#xD;
      for about 15%. Approximately 65% of new patients were diagnosed with ES-SCLC at the first&#xD;
      visit with less than 6 months of median PFS (mPFS) and 8-13 months of median OS (mOS).&#xD;
      Platinum combined with etoposide or irinotecan chemotherapy is the first-line standard&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatment. Despite high objective response of initial treatment, it is evitable&#xD;
      to develop chemotherapy resistance and the effects of follow-up line treatment is&#xD;
      dissatisfying. Therefore, combination therapy may be promising and efficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anlotinib, the brand new multi-target protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) blockers, could normalize&#xD;
      distribution of blood vessels in the tumor, gather T cells and enhance effect of immune drugs&#xD;
      via vascular endothelial growth factor receptor (VEGFR), platelet-derived growth factor&#xD;
      receptor (PDGFR), fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR), type Ⅲ tyrosine kinase and others&#xD;
      signal pathways, and then inhibit the growth, proliferation and differentiation of lung&#xD;
      cancer cells. According to ALTER1202 study, anlotinib played a promising role in local tumor&#xD;
      control and effectively prolonged PFS in third line or more for ES-SCLC patients. Meanwhile,&#xD;
      immunocheckpoint inhibitors can improve tumor immune microenvironment, relieve VEGF-mediated&#xD;
      immunosuppression, reduce Treg activity, promote tumor antigen presenting ability and better&#xD;
      infiltrate T cell into the tumor to play an anti-tumor effect. Emerging studies have shown&#xD;
      that immunocheckpoint inhibitors, such as Atezolizumab, Pembrolizumab and Nivolumab, can&#xD;
      effectively improve ORR, DoR and survival in SCLC patients. In terms of molecular mechanisms,&#xD;
      immunocheckpoint inhibitors and vascular targeting drugs complemented and the combination of&#xD;
      two drugs has superior efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), just as it shown in&#xD;
      IMpower150 and other studies. However, the role of immunocheckpoint inhibitors in maintenance&#xD;
      therapy in SCLC were disappointing in CheckMate451 and a study of pembrolizumab, although it&#xD;
      obtained some victories in first line or more for SCLC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, the investigators proposed that first-line etoposide/platinum-based chemotherapy&#xD;
      followed by toripalimab combined with anlotinib for maintenance may prolong chemo-resistance&#xD;
      in extensive small cell lung cancer.&#xD;
