      Brief Summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      SARS-CoV-2 virus infection is known to cause Lung Injury that begins as dyspnea and exercise&#xD;
      intolerance, but may rapidly progress to Critical COVID-19 with Respiratory Failure and the&#xD;
      need for noninvasive or mechanical ventilation. Mortality rates as high as 80% have been&#xD;
      reported among those who require mechanical ventilation, despite best available intensive&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have not developed respiratory failure be&#xD;
      treated with nebulized ZYESAMI™ (aviptadil acetate, a synthetic version of Vasoactive&#xD;
      Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP)) 100 μg 3x daily plus Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of&#xD;
      Care using an FDA 501(k) cleared mesh nebulizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be progression in severity of COVID-19 (i.e. critical OR severe&#xD;
      progressing to critical) over 28 days. Secondary outcomes will include blood oxygenation as&#xD;
      measured by pulse oximetry, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other&#xD;
      cytokines.&#xD;

      Detailed Description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Attack of the Alveolar Type II (ATII) cell via its ACE2 surface receptor by the SARS-CoV-2&#xD;
      virus leads to respiratory failure, morbidity, and frequently mortality in COVID-19. There is&#xD;
      no approved treatment that specifically targets the pulmonary injury. Vasoactive Intestinal&#xD;
      Peptide (VIP) is known to target the VPAC1 receptor of the ATII cell and to protect that cell&#xD;
      against all manner of injuries, including smoke inhalation, exposure to stomach acid, and&#xD;
      exposure to infectious agents. VIP prevents apoptosis, blocks cytokines, lowers TNFα levels,&#xD;
      reverses CD4/CD8 ratio, and reduces cough and dyspnea in nonclinical and clinical studies.&#xD;
      Aviptadil acetate, a synthetic form of Vasoactive Intestinal Polypeptide (VIP) has been&#xD;
      awarded FDA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Pulmonary Hypertension and&#xD;
      EMEA Orphan Drug Designation for the treatment of ARDS and Sarcoid. ZYESAMI™ (Aviptadil) has&#xD;
      been granted FDA Fast Track Designation for the treatment of ARDS/Acute Lung Injury in&#xD;
      COVID-19.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to identify patients severe COVID-19 who have not yet&#xD;
      developed respiratory failure and to treat them with inhaled ZYESAMI™ in the hope of&#xD;
      preventing progression to Critical COVID-19 with Respiratory Failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonclinical studies demonstrate that VIP is 70% concentrated in the lung, where it binds&#xD;
      primarily to ATII cells. VIP prevents NMDA-induced caspase-3 activation in the lung, inhibits&#xD;
      IL6 and TNFα production, protects against HCl-induced pulmonary edema, These and other&#xD;
      effects have been observed in numerous animal model systems of lung injury in mice, rats,&#xD;
      guinea pigs, sheep, swine, and dogs. In these models, Aviptadil restores barrier function at&#xD;
      the endothelial/alveolar interface and thereby protects the lung and other organs from&#xD;
      failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both intravenous and inhalation preclinical toxicology and safety pharmacology have been&#xD;
      performed in four species, with a six-month trial of inhaled Aviptadil in primates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aviptadil is approved for human use in the treatment of erectile dysfunction in Scandinavia&#xD;
      and several European countries in co-formulation with phentolamine and has a demonstrated&#xD;
      phase 2 safety in trials for Sarcoid, Pulmonary Fibrosis, and Bronchospasm. No adverse safety&#xD;
      signals were seen in a phase I trial IV Aviptadil in ARDS. In that phase I trial, 8 patients&#xD;
      with severe ARDS on mechanical ventilation were treated with ascending doses of VIP. Seven of&#xD;
      the 8 patients were successfully extubated and were alive at the five-day timepoint. Six left&#xD;
      the hospital and one died of an unrelated cardiac event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 60-day phase 2b/3 trial of IV Aviptadil (NCT 04311697) has recently completed enrollment&#xD;
      and 28-day top-line safety data have been reported. No unanticipated serious adverse events&#xD;
      were reported. The only adverse event that was statistically more frequent in&#xD;
      Aviptadil-treated participants than among placebo-treated participants was mild to moderate&#xD;
      diarrhea, which has not been reported as a frequent side-effect of inhaled Aviptadil (30% vs&#xD;
      1.5%; p&lt; .001). Systemic hypotension was seen in both Aviptadil-treated and placebo-treated&#xD;
      participants (25% vs 18.5%; P=NS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five GCP phase 2 trials of Aviptadil were conducted under European regulatory authority. Non&#xD;
      GCP healthy volunteer studies have shown that i.v. infusion of Aviptadil is well tolerated&#xD;
      with few adverse effects including alterations in blood pressure, heart rate, or ECG. In&#xD;
      addition to published studies of human use, Aviptadil has been used on a compounded basis in&#xD;
      certain ICUs for many years in the belief that it preserves life and restores function in&#xD;
      pulmonary hypertension, ARDS, and Acute Lung Injury (ALI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, patients with severe COVID-19 by FDA definition who have not developed&#xD;
      respiratory failure will be treated with nebulized ZYESAMI™ 100 μg in 1 cc normal saline 3x&#xD;
      daily plus Standard of Care vs. placebo + Standard of Care using an FDA 501(k) cleared mesh&#xD;
      nebulizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be progression to in severity of COVID-19 (i.e. critical OR severe&#xD;
      progressing to critical) over 28 days. Secondary outcomes will include blood oxygenation as&#xD;
      measured by pulse oximetry, dyspnea, exercise tolerance, and levels of TNFα IL-6 and other&#xD;
      cytokines.&#xD;
