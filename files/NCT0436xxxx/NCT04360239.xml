    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if continuing fish oil supplementation leads to&#xD;
      higher blood loss in patients undergoing total hip arthroplasty (THA). Another purpose is to&#xD;
      determine if patients on fish oil have less pain after THA. Fish oil (Omega-3 fatty acid) is&#xD;
      commonly used by patients as a natural anti-inflammatory to decrease joint pain from&#xD;
      arthritis. Supplements, including fish oil, are typically stopped 1-2 weeks prior to surgery&#xD;
      as there is an increased risk of perioperative bleeding. However, there are current methods&#xD;
      in joint replacement surgery that decrease the risk of perioperative bleeding. With the risk&#xD;
      of excessive bleeding being minimized, fish oil may not need to be stopped prior to surgery&#xD;
      and could be continued immediately after surgery. The anti-inflammatory effect of fish oil&#xD;
      may also help decrease pain after surgery.&#xD;

      Introduction/Purpose Fish oil (Omega-3 fatty acid) is commonly used by patients as a natural&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory to decrease joint pain from arthritis. Furthermore, fish oil has been found&#xD;
      to decrease the risk of coronary artery disease, decrease mild hypertension, prevent cardiac&#xD;
      arrhythmias and decrease blood triglyceride levels. Supplements, including fish oil, are&#xD;
      typically stopped 1-2 weeks prior to surgery as there is an increased risk of perioperative&#xD;
      bleeding. With modern blood management techniques in joint replacement surgery, including the&#xD;
      use of tranexamic acid, the risk of perioperative bleeding may be minimized. With the risk&#xD;
      being minimized fish oil may not need to be stopped prior to surgery and could be continued&#xD;
      immediately after surgery. The anti-inflammatory effect of fish oil in the perioperative&#xD;
      period may aid in post-operative pain management. The purpose of this study is to determine&#xD;
      if continuing fish oil supplementation leads to higher blood loss in patients undergoing&#xD;
      unilateral total hip arthroplasty (THA). A secondary analysis is to determine if patients on&#xD;
      fish oil have less pain after THA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Calculated total perioperative blood loss milliliters (mL) using Bourke's, Gross',&#xD;
      Camarasa's, and Lopez-Picado's formula based on post-operative (PO) D5 Hemoglobin and&#xD;
      Hematocrit&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Outcomes Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence of blood transfusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative day 1 Hemoglobin and Hematocrit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-operative pain scores&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain medication usage (morphine equivalents)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Difference in wound complications (superficial and deep infection, drainage, hematoma)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Design Open-label, adaptive randomized clinical trial with a 1:1 randomization&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control: No fish oil supplementation. Interventional: Fish oil supplementation started or&#xD;
      continued Fish-Oil naïve subjects will be started on fish oil 4 weeks prior to surgery and&#xD;
      continued until the 6 week follow up. Subjects already taking fish oil will be switched to&#xD;
      the study fish-oil formulation of two capsules twice daily (3000 mg of EPA and DHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be asked to stop all non-Fish Oil supplements 2 weeks prior to and 2 weeks&#xD;
      after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: The primary outcome is blood loss, mean of 1200 mL with a reported standard&#xD;
      deviation of 340 mL. A non-inferiority trial to determine if there is no difference in blood&#xD;
      loss between subjects taking fish oil and subjects not taking fish-oil will require 50&#xD;
      subjects in each arm with 80% power lower limit of a one-sided 90% confidence two-sided&#xD;
      confidence interval that the difference between the two groups is one half the reported&#xD;
      standard deviation of 340 mL (170 mL). To allow for drop-outs, 60 subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization: As patients already taking fish-oil supplements will likely not be willing to&#xD;
      discontinue their regimen, an adaptive randomization will be performed. Patients already on&#xD;
      fish-oil will be assigned to the Interventional Arm and the subsequent randomization&#xD;
      adjusted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Procedures After being deemed eligible, potential study participants will be approached&#xD;
      about the study asked to sign an informed consent form that has been approved by the internal&#xD;
      review board. Patients that meet the inclusion criteria will be randomized to either the&#xD;
      control group or experimental group. Patients in the experimental group will started on 3000&#xD;
      mg of EPA and DHA 4 weeks prior to surgery. The fish oil will be continued in the&#xD;
      perioperative period and until their 6 week follow up appointment. Patients will be supplied&#xD;
      the fish oil at no cost. Patients will stop all other supplements and herbal medicines 2&#xD;
      weeks prior to surgery and will not restart the supplements until 2 weeks after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative hemoglobin and hematocrit will be obtained on all patients during preadmission&#xD;
      testing. All patients must stay one night in the hospital after surgery. A post-day #1 and #5&#xD;
      hemoglobin and hematocrit will be obtained on all patients. Amount of fluid collected in the&#xD;
      wound drain will also be collected. Blood loss will be calculated using the Bourke's, Gross',&#xD;
      Camarasa's, and Lopez-Picado's formula. Data will be collected on the rates of blood&#xD;
      transfusions for each patient. Post-operative day 1 pain scores will be determined for each&#xD;
      patient using the visual analog scale. Pain medication use through patient report will be&#xD;
      collected and daily morphine equivalents starting on the day of surgery up until the patients&#xD;
      6 week follow up will be calculated. Date and quantity of any narcotic refill will be&#xD;
      recorded. Data will also be collected on the rate of wound complications in patients.&#xD;
      Enrollment into the study is voluntary and participants can voluntarily withdraw at any time.&#xD;
