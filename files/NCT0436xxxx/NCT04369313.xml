  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Evidence for benefited newborns following delayed cord clamping (DCC), including increasing&#xD;
      hemoglobin and hematocrit levels, improving iron stores, and decreasing need for blood&#xD;
      transfusion and incidence of intraventricular hemorrhage, in term or preterm infants led the&#xD;
      American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) to recommend a delayed cord&#xD;
      clamping at least 30-60 seconds in vigorous term and preterm infants at birth. Although DCC&#xD;
      has been found to be beneficial to infants, the additional blood provided by DCC could&#xD;
      increase the incidence of jaundice that requires phototherapy and the hyperbilirubinemia, and&#xD;
      the time prolonged by DCC might jeopardize timely resuscitation efforts, if needed. The&#xD;
      acid-base status in umbilical cord blood at birth reflects the newborn's aerobic and&#xD;
      anaerobic intrauterine metabolisms and is an objective measure of the fetal exposure and&#xD;
      response to hypoxia during labour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition in which glucose intolerance develops&#xD;
      during pregnancy. It has been estimated in 2009 that nearly 7% of pregnancies are complicated&#xD;
      by diabetes and approximately 86% of these cases represented women with GDM. The&#xD;
      Hyperglycemia and Adverse Pregnancy Outcome study (HAPO) revealed that the infants of&#xD;
      diabetic mothers (IDMs) are at increased risk of neonatal hypoglycemia, hyperbilirubinemia,&#xD;
      shoulder dystocia, and birth trauma. And newborns to diabetic mothers are at increased risk&#xD;
      of neonatal respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and hypoxia, a major cause of admission in&#xD;
      neonatal intensive care units. There is little direct evidence on the implementation of&#xD;
      delayed umbilical cord clamping in the risk group of IDMs. Therefore, it no clear that the&#xD;
      effectiveness and impairment of DCC in IDMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators conducted a prospective study in performing DCC in the infants&#xD;
      of diabetic mothers versus the newborns with early cord clamping (ECC) to assess the effect&#xD;
      of DCC on neonatal bilirubin levels, hyperbilirubinemia incidence, acid-base status and&#xD;
      hypoxia in IDMs.&#xD;
