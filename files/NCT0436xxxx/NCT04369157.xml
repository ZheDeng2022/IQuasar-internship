  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A decline in cognitive abilities following surgery (POCD: Post-Operative Cognitive&#xD;
      Dysfunction) affects up to 47% of patients undergoing a surgical procedure. Risk factors&#xD;
      include age, previous depression, alcohol and drug use, smoking, cognitive impairment as well&#xD;
      as pre-operative biochemical and haematological abnormalities. Inflammation has been proposed&#xD;
      as a potential cause, however, there is little empirical and clinical evidence in this area&#xD;
      to determine aetiology or reduce risk of incidence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc is an important metal for brain function, with deficiency associated with poorer&#xD;
      cognitive outcomes. In relation to POCD, biomarker studies have revealed that levels of a&#xD;
      zinc-alpha-2-glycoprotein (AZGP1) were lower in patients with POCD. AZGP1 is a&#xD;
      multifunctional glycoprotein implicated in cell adhesion, immune response, transmembrane&#xD;
      transport and cellular proliferation. Microglia, the immune cells of the brain, are highly&#xD;
      sensitive to changes in zinc which have been proposed to contribute to neurodegenerative&#xD;
      disease as well as POCD. However, whilst animal studies looking at the effects of zinc on&#xD;
      cognition have been promising, robust human trials are lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research aims to establish the role of zinc in POCD by determining associations between&#xD;
      zinc status, inflammation, cognitive function, and biomarkers of POCD risk and incidence.&#xD;
      This will be achieved by gathering clinical and cognitive data from a sample of older adults&#xD;
      undergoing surgery. Blood samples will be taken pre and post-operatively to establish zinc&#xD;
      status and plasma concentrations of biomarkers of POCD risk and incidence. Pre and&#xD;
      post-operative cognitive assessments will also be conducted to measure memory and executive&#xD;
      function. Incidence of POCD will be determined via neurological assessment according to&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should associations between zinc status, POCD biomarkers, inflammation, cognitive performance&#xD;
      and POCD incidence be established, not only would it lead to future work to investigate&#xD;
      potential mechanisms of action as well as intervention studies looking to support zinc&#xD;
      status, optimising early identification of individuals who may be at higher risk of&#xD;
      developing POCD should lead to better patient outcomes.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Healthy older adults under-going elective surgery (knee replacement, hip replacement or&#xD;
      colorectal surgery) will be recruited via the Royal Berkshire Hospital. Participants will be&#xD;
      aged 60 years and above, will have the capacity to give fully informed consent and will be&#xD;
      undergoing elective orthopaedic or colorectal surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will involve testing on 3 occasions: 48hours-3 weeks prior to surgery (in the&#xD;
      participant's home), 1-3 days post-surgery (in the Royal Berkshire Hospital) and&#xD;
      approximately one month post-surgery (in the participant's home).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On each occasion, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and Confusion Assessment Method&#xD;
      (CAM) will be administered along with various cognitive tests measuring executive function&#xD;
      (Trials A &amp; B, Stroop, Letter memory task, verbal fluency) and memory (the episodic memory&#xD;
      tests of free recall and recognition from the CERAD: Consortium to Establish a Registry for&#xD;
      Alzheimer's Disease neuropsychological test battery), as well as completion of questionnaires&#xD;
      to determine mood (the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS] and the Positive and&#xD;
      Negative Affect Scale [PANAS]) and sleep quality (the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). The&#xD;
      cognitive testing should take approximately 30-40 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the first session (pre-operation) only, dietary information will also be collected via a&#xD;
      food frequency questionnaire, as well as measures of fluid and crystallised intelligence (the&#xD;
      National Adult Reading Test and Block Design from the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale -&#xD;
      Revised respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, at each visit, a blood sample (maximum volume of 9mL, less than one tablespoon)&#xD;
      will be taken from the participants for analysis of zinc concentration and markers of POCD&#xD;
      and inflammation.&#xD;
