  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The incidence of malnutrition in patients with severe neurological diseases is approximately&#xD;
      37%, among which hypoproteinemia is a common manifestation. It has been confirmed that serum&#xD;
      albumin level is closely related to severity and mortality for patients. Protein is the basic&#xD;
      component of tissue cells in the body, which plays an important role in the growth and&#xD;
      development of senescent cells and the repair of damaged tissues. At present, the results of&#xD;
      some randomized controlled studies show that it is difficult to achieve enough protein&#xD;
      supplementation by commercial standard enteral nutrition agents alone, and additional protein&#xD;
      supplementation is required. Commercial standard enteral nutrition preparations, whose whole&#xD;
      protein components are casein and soy protein, do not achieve optimal uptake and utilization&#xD;
      compared to whey proteins, which are more readily absorbed and utilized by the human gut.&#xD;
      Whey protein and its hydrolyzed products have better nutritional quality than casein, which&#xD;
      can provide high-quality nitrogen source for enteral nutrition and play an important role in&#xD;
      correcting negative nitrogen balance, promoting wound healing and improving body immunity.&#xD;
      Whether whey protein supplementation based on standard enteral nutrition preparation can&#xD;
      improve serum albumin level and reduce the incidence of hypoproteinemia in patients with&#xD;
      severe acute neurological disease has not been proved. In conclusion, we propose the&#xD;
      hypothesis that compared with the standard enteral nutrition preparation regimen, the enteral&#xD;
      nutrition regimen supplemented with whey protein in patients with severe neurological disease&#xD;
      is more beneficial to improve the nutritional indicators of patients and reduce the&#xD;
      occurrence of hypoproteinemia. It is expected that this randomized controlled trial will&#xD;
      provide a new clinical basis for optimizing the enteral nutrition support program for&#xD;
      patients with severe neurological diseases.&#xD;

      The purpose of the study is to compare standard enteral nutrition regimen with the enteral&#xD;
      nutrition regimen supplemented with whey protein in severe neurological disease patients and&#xD;
      to observe nutritional indicators improvement in these patients. A total of 116 subjects will&#xD;
      be included. Counting process is as follows: referring available literature and the mean&#xD;
      value of serum albumin in patients on the 14th day of our preliminary tests, and the&#xD;
      difference test is used to compare the mean values of two independent samples. The ratio of&#xD;
      the experimental group and control group is 1:1. It was assumed that the serum albumin level&#xD;
      in the experimental group was higher than that in the control group. A single end is taken,&#xD;
      α=0.05, 1-β=0.80, experimental group patients serum albumin（Χ±S）=37.9±5.1, the control group&#xD;
      serum albumin（Χ±S）=35.6±4.8, so the total sample size was 116.It was estimated that 116&#xD;
      patients were enrolled consecutively, which were divided into experimental group and control&#xD;
      group by computer generated random number table. Patients in both groups received enteral&#xD;
      nutrition therapy with continuous tube feeding for 14 days. According to the nutritional&#xD;
      treatment requirements of critically ill patients in the Asia-Pacific region in 2016,&#xD;
      patients with severe acute stress were given energy demand for 25~30kcal/kg/d, protein demand&#xD;
      for 1.2~2g/kg/d and other standardized clinical treatments. Control group nutrition program:&#xD;
      standardized enteral nutrition preparation only. Experimental group nutrition program: whey&#xD;
      protein powder was added on the basis of standardized enteral nutrition preparation.&#xD;
      According to the body weight of the patients, different enteral nutritional preparations and&#xD;
      dose adjustments were selected to ensure that the calorie and protein intake of the two&#xD;
      groups of patients met the above nutritional treatment requirements.Primary endpoint: serum&#xD;
      albumin level at 14 days of enteral nutrition. Secondary end points: 1. APACHE II, GCS and&#xD;
      other clinical scores at 14 days; 2. total serum protein, proalbumin, hemoglobin and other&#xD;
      nutritional indicators; 3. the number and ratio of white blood cells, neutrophils, c-reactive&#xD;
      protein, interleukin-6, procalcitonin, absolute count of T lymphocyte subsets, immunoglobulin&#xD;
      and other inflammatory indicators at 14 days; 4. the number of cases of gastrointestinal&#xD;
      complications such as gastric retention, vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal distention,&#xD;
      constipation and gastrointestinal bleeding during the 14 days of enteral nutrition; 5. the&#xD;
      number of patients with serum albumin &lt; 30g/L within 14 days after admission.&#xD;
