      A Phase 2a, Multicenter, Open-Label Study of DKN-01 in Combination with Tislelizumab ±&#xD;
      Chemotherapy as First-Line or Second-Line Therapy in Adult Patients with Inoperable, Locally&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 2a nonrandomized, open-label, multicenter study to be conducted concurrently&#xD;
      in 2 Parts (Parts A and B). Approximately 72 patients aged 18 years or older with inoperable,&#xD;
      histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic G/GEJ adenocarcinoma with measurable&#xD;
      disease (RECIST v1.1) requiring therapy will be enrolled in the study. Both parts are&#xD;
      designed to evaluate safety, tolerability, and efficacy of the combination therapy of&#xD;
      intravenous (IV) DKN-01 and tislelizumab ± CAPOX in G/GEJ adenocarcinoma patients. Treatment&#xD;
      continues in repeating 21-day cycles until patient meets criteria for discontinuation or is&#xD;
      no longer deriving clinical benefit. Parts A and B will be enrolled concurrently. Two doses&#xD;
      of DKN-01 will be evaluated in Part B (Part B1 and Part B2)&#xD;
