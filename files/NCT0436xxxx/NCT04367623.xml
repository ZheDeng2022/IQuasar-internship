  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Spinal Cord Injury (SCI) affects person's ability to move and feel sensation from the body.&#xD;
      About half of patients with tetraplegia (high level SCI) have an incomplete injury, i.e. have&#xD;
      some sensation and control of muscles preserved and could recover some function of their&#xD;
      upper limbs. In this study the researchers would like to increase the effect of physical&#xD;
      therapy of the upper limbs by sensory-motor priming. To achieve this they will use Brain&#xD;
      Computer Interface (BCI) controlled Functional Electrical Stimulation (FES) immediately prior&#xD;
      to the physical therapy of the upper limbs. BCI will be operated by motor attempt (motor&#xD;
      priming) which will activate the FES applied to participants' hand muscles to achieve&#xD;
      movement (sensory and motor priming). Physical therapy in this study will not replace&#xD;
      conventional therapy that participant receive as a part of their standard treatment. There&#xD;
      will be two groups: a treatment group (BCI FES with physical therapy) and a control group&#xD;
      (physical therapy only), each receiving 20 therapy sessions of matched duration (40-50 min)&#xD;
      of their dominant hand. Based on power analysis and results from our study (Osuagwu et al.&#xD;
      2016, J Neural Eng) there will be thirteen participants per group matched by age and the&#xD;
      level of injury. Therapy will be applied to dominant hand only, because of the limited time&#xD;
      available for experimental studies on participants who are already under active&#xD;
      rehabilitation programme. Primary measures will be functional outcomes (range of movement,&#xD;
      muscle strength, grip force, independence) while secondary outcomes will be neurological&#xD;
      outcomes (EEG activity) and quality of life measures. The outcomes will be compared between&#xD;
      the treatment and the control group and between the dominant and the non-dominant hand of&#xD;
      each participant.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants who decide to take part will be assigned to a treatment or a control groups.&#xD;
      Both groups will have the same assessments and the same number of therapy sessions. Therapy&#xD;
      group will have a training that consist of Brain Computer Interface controlled Functional&#xD;
      Electrical Stimulation followed by physical practice of the dominant upper limb while the&#xD;
      control group will have physical practice only. One experimental session including will last&#xD;
      about 60 min for both groups (including setup and therapy) and participants in each group&#xD;
      will receive 20 sessions, about 3 times per week.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Assesments There will be three assessments: an initial assessment within a week prior to&#xD;
           the first therapy session, a final assessment within a week following the last therapy&#xD;
           session and a follow up session 3 months after the last therapy session. Assessments&#xD;
           will consist of qualitative and quantitative measures. It will comprise of assessments&#xD;
           of motor functions, neurological functions and participants feedback on the therapy&#xD;
           (questionnaires and. Interviews)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Therapy There will be 20 therapy sessions for each group 2.1. Therapy Treatment Group&#xD;
           This will consist of 30 min of BCI FES followed by 30 min of physical practice of the&#xD;
           dominant upper limb. We decided to include only dominant arm/hand from two reasons: Each&#xD;
           participant can be their own control to compare the outcome between hands. The other&#xD;
           reason is that it is not possible to find more than an hour free time in between of&#xD;
           their regular physical therapies and other activities. 2.1.1. BCI FES Participants will&#xD;
           be wearing an EEG device (Epoch, Emotiv) and will have several pair of self-adhesive FES&#xD;
           electrodes attached to their arms, over muscles that control reaching and grasping. The&#xD;
           exact location and number of FES electrodes will be patient specific and will depend on&#xD;
           their functional ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each therapy session will start with a 5 min long calibration (to set BCI parameters for that&#xD;
      day) followed by training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During calibration phase participants will watch a computer screen showing a hand squeezing a&#xD;
      ball. Participants will imagine doing the same action while their EEG will be recorded.&#xD;
      BCI-FES Upon seeing a visual cue (a small cross) on a screen, participants attempt to move&#xD;
      their dominant arm and hand to achieve reach and grasp movement towards an object (e.g. a&#xD;
      plastic bottle). They repeat this 30 to 40 times in total, targeting 30 successful trials.&#xD;
      The number of trials is based on our previous study (Osuagwu et al 2016, J Neural Eng).&#xD;
      During each trial, upon the appearance of cue on the screen, the participant has 10 seconds&#xD;
      to attempt movement to activate FES. They will practice movements of one hand only so there&#xD;
      will be only one type of cue. On a successful attempt, FES will be initiated for 10-15&#xD;
      seconds to complete reach and grasp movement. An anti-gravity support will be used to assist&#xD;
      movement, if necessary. This might be mentally demanding for some participants, and they&#xD;
      might require breaks in between trials. Thus although BCI FES effectively lasts about 10 min&#xD;
      (the same as in our previous study) the whole BCI FES session will take about 30 min. BCI FES&#xD;
      will be immediately followed by physical practice. It is not possible to wait for&#xD;
      participants regular occupation therapy because of a relatively short duration of the motor&#xD;
      priming effect (from the literature it is 10-30 min).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After 1st, 5th, 10th , 15th and 20th session participants will fill out NASA task load index&#xD;
      questionnaire, which takes about 5 min. This measures their workload. 2.1.2. Physical&#xD;
      practice Immediately after BCI FES, participant will have physical therapy for 30 min. The&#xD;
      objects and devices typically used in occupational therapy, putty, pegboards,&#xD;
      nut-bolt-boards, rings, etc will be used for reaching and grasping tasks. These tasks may&#xD;
      change over time depending on the capability of participant. FES will not be used in this&#xD;
      phase 2.2. Therapy Control Group Control group will receive 40 min of physical practice only,&#xD;
      that will be similar to the physical practice in the treatment group. Total duration is based&#xD;
      on the total duration of BCI FES (10 min) and physical practice (30 min) in the treatment&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
