  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical trial will evaluate a new combination of pembrolizumab, HPV-16 E6/E7 specific&#xD;
      therapeutic vaccination (ISA101b) and cisplatin-based chemoradiotherapy for patients with&#xD;
      newly diagnosed, local-regionally advanced, intermediate risk HPV-associated head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to enroll adult male and female patients who have intermediate risk disease&#xD;
      with histologically-confirmed head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) with no evidence&#xD;
      of distant metastasis. All patients will receive the same treatment and there is no active&#xD;
      control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this trial, patients will undergo biopsy followed by treatment with the ISA101b vaccine&#xD;
      which targets human papillomavirus (HPV). The vaccine treatment will begin 2 weeks prior to&#xD;
      cisplatin and Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (cisplatin-IMRT) and one week prior to&#xD;
      the first dose of pembrolizumab, an anti-cancer immunotherapy targeting PD-1. The vaccine&#xD;
      will be administered 2 additional times at weeks 2 and 5. Pembrolizumab will be initiated 1&#xD;
      week prior to cisplatin-IMRT at the dose of 200 mg IV q3 weeks (+/- 3 days). Pembrolizumab&#xD;
      will be continued concurrently through cisplatin-IMRT (weeks 3, 6 ), and continued for a 15&#xD;
      week maintenance period after completion of cisplatin-IMRT for a total pembrolizumab&#xD;
      treatment period of 24 weeks (8 doses; 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate patient survival following this combination of&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;

In addition to the relative increase of 20%, the sum must also demonstrate an absolute increase of at least 5 mm.
