  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific aims of the current study were: 1) To determine the prevalence of IDNA in a&#xD;
      sample of Mexican women of reproductive age and 2) To determine how iron supplementation in&#xD;
      IDNA women influences physical work capacity during submaximal exercise . The researchers&#xD;
      hypothesized that marginally iron depleted women will have improved physical work capacity&#xD;
      during submaximal intermittent exercise tests after dietary iron supplementation. However, no&#xD;
      improvement in peak maximal oxygen consumption after dietary iron supplementation because&#xD;
      they will remain non-anemic.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent estimates of the prevalence of anemia among non-pregnant Mexican women of reproductive&#xD;
      age range from 15 percent for a nationally representative sample from the 1988 National&#xD;
      Nutrition Survey to 29 percent for low socioeconomic women from the PROGRESA baseline survey&#xD;
      of 1998 (Mexican Ministry of Health, unpublished report). The cause of most of this anemia is&#xD;
      iron deficiency. It can be assumed that time between 15 and 30 percent of Mexican women also&#xD;
      experience iron deficiency without also experiencing anemia. In some studies of anemic women,&#xD;
      iron deficiency has been shown to result in reduced physical performance as measured by&#xD;
      VO2max (the oxygen consumption at maximum physical exertion), presumably due to reduced&#xD;
      oxygen (02) transport related to the reduced hemoglobin (Hb) concentration. However, no&#xD;
      effects of iron deficiency have been shown on VO2max in women who were not anemic. Given that&#xD;
      Hb concentration is not reduced in iron deficient non anemic women, it is expected that&#xD;
      VO2max remains unaffected. However, this less severe form of iron deficiency may still affect&#xD;
      physical performance. The important role of iron in the synthesis of many of the enzymes&#xD;
      involved in oxidative metabolism suggests that moderate levels of iron deficiency may impair&#xD;
      muscular energy transformation at levels of exertion that are not as severe as those&#xD;
      reflected in VO2max. The choice of the appropriate sub maximal physical performance test is&#xD;
      therefore critical to successful demonstration of the effects of moderate iron deficiency on&#xD;
      response to exercise stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators proposed to test the effects of iron deficiency on physical&#xD;
      performance using a randomized double blind design that assigns marginally iron depleted,&#xD;
      physically active women between 18 and 45 years to two treatments. One half of the women will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to a group that receives a daily oral iron supplement (20 mg of&#xD;
      elemental iron as slow release ferrous sulfate) while the remaining women received a placebo.&#xD;
      Investigators anticipated that iron supplementation would replete iron body stores in all&#xD;
      women and increase Hb only in those who are marginally anemic. Investigators tested the&#xD;
      physical performance response to iron treatment with two exercise tests. It was hypothesized&#xD;
      that VO2max would not be affected by iron supplementation. A graded submaximal exertion test&#xD;
      (30 60% of VO2max) to estimate energy expenditure (EE), gross efficiency (GE), and net&#xD;
      efficiency (NE) was administered to test for an increase in work efficiency due to iron&#xD;
      supplementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study has important implications for the definition of dietary iron requirements in this&#xD;
      segment of the Mexican population. The physical performance test used in this study (EE, GE,&#xD;
      and NE), while well recognized, have never been applied to this type of research question nor&#xD;
      has it been examined in relation to endurance performance in Mexican women. Investigators&#xD;
      believe that previous reliance on the VO2max test to measure performance has biased&#xD;
      conclusions toward concern only for the anemic subject, while the less severe forms of iron&#xD;
      deficiency have been considered benign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study, if successful in supporting the stated hypotheses, will serve as further confirm&#xD;
      the deleterious effects of iron deficiency without anemia and justify future research on more&#xD;
      practical measures of performance related to female economic productivity and time and effort&#xD;
      allocated to child care and household responsibilities.&#xD;
