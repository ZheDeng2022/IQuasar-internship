      Background Computerized cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) is proven to be an effective&#xD;
      self-help tool for preventing depression and suicide. Patient adherence is one of the&#xD;
      components that the effectiveness of cCBT self-help tools are dependent on and that needs to&#xD;
      be researched for understanding and maximizing the effectiveness of computer-based&#xD;
      interventions for depression and suicide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims The aims of this study were to compare the adherence of iFightDepression (iFD) online&#xD;
      tool user patients with and without an extra weekly phone call consultation and to test&#xD;
      predictors of adherence.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Depressive disorders are recognized as one of the most widespread lifetime disorders and&#xD;
      unipolar depression is identified as a leading cause of disease burden . These findings&#xD;
      legitimate the importance of reducing depressive symptoms by implementing cost-effective&#xD;
      interventions. Despite the fact that cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is proved to be an&#xD;
      efficient treatment for depression, mental health care resources are scarce and cannot fulfil&#xD;
      the huge amount of need for face-to-face psychotherapeutic treatments. The aim of&#xD;
      increasingly deploying computerized cognitive behavioural therapy (cCBT) is to improve access&#xD;
      to psychological treatments, reduce waiting lists, speed up clinical recovery and to bridge&#xD;
      the paucity of specialists in small towns. Moreover, guided web-based self-help interventions&#xD;
      are proved to be cost-effective and time-saving for mental health care systems as well.&#xD;
      Numerous studies have proved the cCBT to be effective in case of depression, however drop-out&#xD;
      rates of online self-help interventions are usually high - between 5 and 38.7%. Systematic&#xD;
      reviews showed that in web-based self-help treatments extra support obtains higher adherence&#xD;
      than no guidance. Treatment-adherence, defined as the amount of a therapeutic intervention&#xD;
      that an individual engages with or completes, has clear clinical implications: poor adherence&#xD;
      limits the exposure to the full program and increases the required 'dosage' of treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the comparison of drop-out rates of different psychological treatments, no difference has&#xD;
      been found between face-to-face and web-based interventions. Previous research has found that&#xD;
      the drop-out risk from cCBT is significantly correlated with gender, educational level and&#xD;
      age. Increased drop-out risk included male gender, younger age and lower educational level.&#xD;
      This finding has been proved in another research as well, where females have been found to&#xD;
      provide more effort to cope with depression compared to males.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to adherence, a low educational level might negatively influence the adherence to&#xD;
      cCBT as understanding the content of intervention can be troublesome. Results from previous&#xD;
      studies suggested that younger individuals had higher adherence to web-based treatment,&#xD;
      whilst some other studies showed that younger age was related to low treatment adherence.&#xD;
      Several findings also suggested that additional forms of guidance or support via phone or&#xD;
      email increase the level of adherence. In order to offer web-based treatment to patients with&#xD;
      the most benefits, it would be useful to identify the predictors of treatment adherence and&#xD;
      causes of the relatively high dropout rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Insomnia is one of the main symptoms of depression. Studies show insomnia to be one of the&#xD;
      risk factors such for development of depression as for reducing response to depression&#xD;
      treatment and increasing relapse of depression. Therefore, to quest a correlation between&#xD;
      adherence in an online self-help program for depression and sleep disturbances would be&#xD;
      subservient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our goal in this study was to identify predictors of adherence to a computerized CBT program&#xD;
      and to investigate whether sociodemographic variables, hopelessness and sleep disturbances&#xD;
      are connected to adherence. Another objective was to compare adherence in web-based self-help&#xD;
      intervention with and without weekly follow-up phone-calls as extra support. Our hypothesis&#xD;
      was that phone-support would increase adherence level of cCBT.&#xD;
