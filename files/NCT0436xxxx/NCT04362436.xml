  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open label study for patients with inoperable metastatic neuroendocrine liver&#xD;
      deposits to see whether treatment with Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (TheraSpheres)&#xD;
      could lead to improved treatment response rates with acceptable toxicity (minimal serious&#xD;
      adverse events reported). This research will also look at the progression free survival and&#xD;
      quality of life of the patients who decide to join the study.&#xD;

      Neuroendocrine tumours (NETs) are tumours which arise from cells of the neuroendocrine&#xD;
      system, which is the mechanism by which the hypothalamus maintains homeostasis.&#xD;
      Neuroendocrine cells secrete hormones, a type of signalling molecule, that play a role in&#xD;
      many of the body's different processes including growth and development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surgical resection remains the only curative approach to NETs. However, due to non-specific&#xD;
      representations, over 50% of NETs are unresectable at diagnosis. Patients with metastatic&#xD;
      high grade, poorly differentiated tumours have a median overall survival of 5 months, as&#xD;
      compared to 33 months for those with metastatic low or intermediate grade, well&#xD;
      differentiated disease. The liver is the most common site for metastasis and is directly&#xD;
      correlated to a much poorer prognosis if moderately to poorly differentiated disease is seen,&#xD;
      with 5-year survival of 50% less than those without liver metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Current treatment for non-resectable NETs include somatostatin analogues, systematic&#xD;
      anti-cancer therapy (with etoposide/carboplatin being the most commonly prescribed regime),&#xD;
      radionuclide therapy, Meta-iodobenzylguanidine Therapy (MiBGG) and Peptide Related Radiation&#xD;
      Therapy (PRRT). The last showing great promise in clinical trials with progression free&#xD;
      survival at 20 months of 65.2% in the Netter1 trial. However, this therapy is reliant on&#xD;
      tumoural expression and a key density of the somatostatin 2 receptor (SSTR2), a feature that&#xD;
      is often lost with increasing grade and aggressiveness of disease. In short, the current&#xD;
      proposed treatments for non-resectable NETs are still to be optimised and depend heavily on&#xD;
      patient status, SSTR2 expression and in the case of chemotherapy, is based on evidence of&#xD;
      treatment regimens for other types of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Selective Internal Radiation Therapy (SIRT), by hepatic arterial delivery of yttrium-90&#xD;
      (Y-90) labelled microspheres, is a safe and effective locoregional therapy that combines a&#xD;
      dual anticancer therapy, combining the effects of hepatic arterial embolization with targeted&#xD;
      delivery of high dose radiation. This selectively delivers a tumouricidal dose of&#xD;
      beta-radiation to the liver tumour, while maintaining a low radiation dose to surrounding&#xD;
      normal tissue. 20% of the blood supply of healthy liver comes from the hepatic artery, while&#xD;
      90% of liver tumours derive &gt;90% of their blood supply from the same artery and so the&#xD;
      hepatic artery is therefore a compelling target to deliver largely tumour specific treatment,&#xD;
      sparing healthy liver. SIRT microspheres are also small enough to get trapped in the liver&#xD;
      microvasculature but too large to pass through capillary beds and should therefore not reach&#xD;
      other places of the body to cause unwanted side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TheraSpheres consist of an yttrium-90 containing glass microsphere. Yttrium-90 is a pure beta&#xD;
      emitter with a half-life of approximately 64.1 hours. It has the same toxicity profile as&#xD;
      many chemotherapy agents with the common side effects reported as fatigue, anorexia, pain,&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting. In a past clinical trial on NETs, SIRT has shown a radiological response&#xD;
      rate of 63% and a median survival of 70 months.&#xD;
