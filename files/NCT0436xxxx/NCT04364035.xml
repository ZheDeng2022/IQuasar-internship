      AELIX-003 study aims to investigate the safety, tolerability, immunogenicity and efficacy of&#xD;
      a regimen containing AELIX Therapeutics' HTI T-cell vaccines and Gilead´s Toll-Like Receptor&#xD;
      7 (TLR7) agonist vesatolimod in HIV-infected individuals on antiretroviral therapy. Study&#xD;
      that will be conducted in 57 participants who have started antiretroviral therapy during&#xD;
      early HIV infection, enrolled at various clinical trial sites in Spain. All participants will&#xD;
      be on antiretroviral therapy upon starting the study, with their HIV viral loads &lt;50&#xD;
      copies/mL. Following exposure to the vaccine/vesatolimod, all participants, under careful&#xD;
      monitoring, will temporarily stop their antiretroviral drugs to determine if the intervention&#xD;
      is effective in keeping their HIV levels under control.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study will evaluate safety of the investigational drugs ChAdOx1.HTI and MVA.HTI (referenced&#xD;
      collectively as CCMM) with vesatolimod (also known as GS-9620) in participants with early&#xD;
      treated HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will also investigate the immunogenicity of CCMM + vesatolimod treatment&#xD;
      and the impact of CCMM + vesatolimod treatment on viral rebound and viral control following&#xD;
      an analytical treatment interruption (ATI) in participants with early treated HIV-1&#xD;
      infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIVACAT T cell immunogen (HTI) is a novel T cell immunogen covering the most vulnerable&#xD;
      regions of HIV. The encoding DNA sequence that has been inserted in various vaccine vectors,&#xD;
      including viral and non-viral vectors Administration of the HTI immunogen is implemented&#xD;
      through a heterologous prime-boost approach that includes 2 vaccine components. The aim of&#xD;
      the sequential administration of the therapeutic vaccines is to achieve a so-called&#xD;
      &quot;functional cure,&quot; in which HIV-infected participants can control viral replication in the&#xD;
      absence of ART. In this double blind, randomised, safety and tolerability study (AELIX-003),&#xD;
      the HTI immunogen will be administered in a prime-boost regimen consisting of vaccinations&#xD;
      with ChAdOx1.HTI (prime) and MVA.HTI (boost).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment regimen in this study will also include a toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) agonist,&#xD;
      GS-9620, which is supported by a recent non clinical study where sequential administration of&#xD;
      vaccines and a TLR7 agonist (GS-986, an analogue of vesatolimod) demonstrated efficacy in&#xD;
      simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV)-infected rhesus monkeys on ART.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HTI is currently being tested in the Phase I, double blind, placebo controlled clinical study&#xD;
      AELIX-002 through a heterologous prime-boost vaccination employing 3 products expressing the&#xD;
      HTI antigen, DNA.HTI and MVA.HTI and ChAdOx.HTI. The available clinical data from AELIX-002&#xD;
      do not suggest a risk for serious adverse events (SAEs) from the products alone, used&#xD;
      sequentially, or from the immunogen itself.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will screen HIV-1 infected participants who have initiated ART within 180 days (6&#xD;
      months) of the estimated date of HIV-1 acquisition and who have achieved virological&#xD;
      suppression for at least 1 year prior entering AELIX-003. Participants who provide informed&#xD;
      consent and meet study entry criteria will be randomised into 1 of 2 parallel treatment&#xD;
      groups. The study will be conducted in 3 periods: Period 1 will last 48 weeks during which&#xD;
      participants will receive blinded IMPs and will continue their ART regimen; Period 2 will&#xD;
      last up to 24 weeks during which participants will discontinue their ART regimen; and Period&#xD;
      3 will last 12 weeks during which participants will be monitored following the restart of&#xD;
      their ART.&#xD;
