  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate why individuals with type 2 diabetes are at&#xD;
      increased risk for heart disease and stroke. This study will investigate risk factors for&#xD;
      heart disease and stroke, including platelet (involved in clotting) activity, inflammation,&#xD;
      blood vessel wall function, and genetic information (blueprints of your cells), in&#xD;
      participants with type 2 diabetes and elevated cholesterol. This study will also include a&#xD;
      control group - subjects with elevated cholesterol who do not have diabetes. All participants&#xD;
      will be given cholesterol-lowering medicines (PCSK9 inhibitor and statin or ezetimibe) for 1&#xD;
      month with the same risk factors being measured following cholesterol reduction. This study&#xD;
      will help understand why individuals with type 2 diabetes are at higher risk for heart&#xD;
      disease and stroke before and even after cholesterol reduction.&#xD;

      As part of this SFRN investigating REPAIR (non-progression of clinical events or regression&#xD;
      of atherosclerosis) in T2D, this project will reveal mechanisms behind the platelet mediated&#xD;
      increased cardiovascular risk in patients with T2D by focusing on the platelet transcriptome&#xD;
      in those with clinical progression and subsequent cardiovascular events versus those without&#xD;
      clinical progression. A prospective clinical study will investigate platelet activity and&#xD;
      transcriptome before and after significant cholesterol reduction to better understand&#xD;
      mechanisms of increased residual risk observed in patients with T2D, even when cholesterol is&#xD;
      not elevated. By combining prospective studies on the platelet phenotype in humans with T2D,&#xD;
      mechanistic mouse models of diabetes-accelerated atherosclerosis in the Fisher, Basic&#xD;
      Project, and the human plaque and genomic data available data from the Giannarelli,&#xD;
      Population Project, the investigators believe the research will fill an important and&#xD;
      clinically significant gap in the understanding of how diabetes attenuates cardiovascular&#xD;
      repair and to identify new treatment and prevention strategies.&#xD;

    <description>The difference in platelet activity will be assessed by measuring changes in monocyte-platelet aggregates. Monocyte platelet aggregates (MPA) are a robust marker of platelet activity and inflammatory monocytes. The difference in platelet activity before and after cholesterol reduction will be compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. The study will also perform a linear mixed model for the multivariate analysis; the primary outcome will be the change in platelet activity (MPA) before and after cholesterol reduction. All tests will be 2-tailed, and a P &lt;0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.</description>

    <measure>Change in platelet activity (LTA) before and after cholesterol reduction</measure>
    <time_frame>Follow up visit (4 weeks)</time_frame>
    <description>The difference in platelet activity will be assessed by using the light transmission aggregometry test (LTA). Light Transmission Aggregometry [LTA] is frequently undertaken as the first test of platelet function, as a screening test for a bleeding disorder and in addition for monitoring of anti-platelet drugs using platelet rich plasma (PRP). The difference in platelet activity before and after cholesterol reduction will be compared using paired t-test or Wilcoxon signed-rank test. We will also perform a linear mixed model for the multivariate analysis; the primary outcome will be the change in platelet activity (LTA) before and after cholesterol reduction. All tests will be 2-tailed, and a P &lt;0.05 will be considered as statistically significant.</description>
