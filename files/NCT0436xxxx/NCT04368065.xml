      COVID-19 Active Research Experience (CARE) is an observational, direct-to-participant,&#xD;
      web-based, longitudinal study of adults with COVID-19 or COVID-19 like illness or who were&#xD;

      This is an observational, direct-to-participant, web-based, longitudinal study of adults with&#xD;
      COVID-19 or COVID-19 like illness to better understand risk factors, symptoms, and treatments&#xD;
      for COVID-19 illness and vaccine safety and effectiveness. Upon consent and enrollment,&#xD;
      participants will complete an initial baseline survey reporting their demographics, relevant&#xD;
      medical history, testing, vaccination, symptoms, use of prescription medications as well as&#xD;
      use of supplements and other factors. The study follow-up period is 12 months. During the&#xD;
      first month of follow-up participants will be invited to complete a symptom diary weekly to&#xD;
      gauge symptom progression and severity and to provide updates on pharmaceutical and&#xD;
      non-pharmaceutical interventions as well as healthcare encounters. Reporting will then reduce&#xD;
      to monthly for Month 2 through 12.&#xD;
