  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to observe whether PARP inhibitors have an effect on serum&#xD;
      creatinine level, and whether this reflects a change in creatinine secretion or a true change&#xD;
      in kidney function.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      PARPi medications interact with transporters along the renal tubules involved in the&#xD;
      secretion of creatinine and an increase in serum creatinine is often observed in patients&#xD;
      treated with these agents; however, it is not known whether PARP inhibitors are associated&#xD;
      with an actual change in the glomerular filtration rate, or if the observed elevations of&#xD;
      serum creatinine are a result of a drug effect on creatinine secretion unrelated to changes&#xD;
      in kidney function. The investigators therefore propose a prospective observational study to&#xD;
      examine the incidence of elevation in serum creatinine from baseline levels in patients&#xD;
      initiated on PARP inhibitors and compare the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on&#xD;
      creatinine to that from alternative tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary purposes of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assess the incidence of increase in serum creatinine in patients with a solid-organ&#xD;
           cancer on treatment with a PARP inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the estimated glomerular filtration rate based on serum creatinine with that&#xD;
           of alternative biomarkers to assess whether changes in serum creatinine reflect changes&#xD;
           in kidney function or creatinine secretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the persistence or resolution of creatinine increase and/or GFR decrease&#xD;
           noted after discontinuation of PARPi&#xD;
