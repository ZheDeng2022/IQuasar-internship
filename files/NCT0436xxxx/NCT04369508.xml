  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Immunotherapy is currently revolutionizing the field in oncology. However, prostate cancer is&#xD;
      poorly responsive to immune checkpoint inhibition. The combination of immunotherapy and&#xD;
      radiotherapy is an emerging clinical treatment aradigm. X-ray radiation treatment can&#xD;
      activate both the adaptive and innate immune systems through directly killing tumor cells,&#xD;
      causing mutations in tumor-derived peptides, and causing localized inflammation that&#xD;
      increases immune cell trafficking to tumors. Recently, preclinical study reported that immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibition combined with radiotherapy treats CPRC with significant increases in&#xD;
      median survival compared to drug alone.&#xD;

      Permanent brachytherapy is one of those standard treatments for localized prostate cancer&#xD;
      patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsy confirms prostate cancer. Blood and urine of localized prostate cancer patients will&#xD;
      be collected before and at different time points after permanent brachytherapy (1, 3, 6, and&#xD;
      12 months)&#xD;

    <description>Briefly, the patient had a general anesthesia and PPB was performed by using the &quot;real-time&quot; intraoperative planning method guided by TRUS. The radioactive seeds were inserted transperineally according to a modified peripherally loaded Seattle technique 17. I-125 was used for all implants with a mean seed activity of 0.45 mCi per seed. All procedures were completed by a single surgeon.</description>
