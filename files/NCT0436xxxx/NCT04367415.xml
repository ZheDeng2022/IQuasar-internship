    <textblock>
      Anatomic Fallopian tubal patency and physiologic patency testing are feasible via&#xD;
      hystertoscopy. This study aims to test the impact of different types of intrauterine polyp(s)&#xD;
      on Darwish test (office hysteroscopic bubble suction test and tubal peristalsis).&#xD;

      It will include women with suspected intrauterine polyp(s) as diagnosed by transvaginal&#xD;
      ultrasonography (TVS) or saline infusion sonography (SIS). They will be women complaining&#xD;
      from abnormal uterine bleeding in the form of menorrhagia, metorrhagia, intermenstrual&#xD;
      spotting or postcoital bleeding, or infertility. Intrauterine polyp(s) could be included&#xD;
      based on a recent hysterosalpingography (HSG) with an intrauterine circumscribed filling&#xD;
      defect with sharp border. Preoperative counseling of all patients followed by an informed&#xD;
      written consent taken from those who will agree. The included patients subjected to complete&#xD;
      history taking and meticulous physical examination. A suspected pregnancy, heavy vaginal&#xD;
      bleeding, active pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), severe co-morbidity, e.g., severe&#xD;
      cardiac, neurologic, or chest disease, and other medical contraindications to pregnancy will&#xD;
      be exclusion criteria of this study. Selected cases will be subjected to office hysteroscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculation is based on the investigator's previous study on the prevalence of&#xD;
      tubal patency using bubble suction test in infertility patients with normal FT. The&#xD;
      percentage of agreement between office hysteroscopy and diagnostic laparoscopy will be 92%&#xD;
      and 88% for the right and left tubes respectively. If it is supposed that bubble suction test&#xD;
      would be positive in about 90% of apparently normal FT and it would be positive in about 60%&#xD;
      of cases with intrauterine polyp(s), sample size in each group would be 51 cases needed to&#xD;
      have a confidence level of 95% with α error of 0.05 (the real value is within ±5% of the&#xD;
      measured/surveyed value). The vulva, vagina and the thighs will be disinfected with a 10%&#xD;
      povidone-iodine solution. Sterile draping will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Office diagnostic hysteroscopy will be performed using a 2.6 mm 30° rigid scope with a 3.2mm&#xD;
      outer sheath (Karl Storz, Tutlingen, Germany). At the beginning in all cases vaginoscopic&#xD;
      approach is tried but if any difficulty will be encountered, grasping of the anterior lip of&#xD;
      cervix with a volsellum will be done. Therafter, the uterus will be distended with normal&#xD;
      saline at 100-150 mmHg generated from a pneumatic cuff of sphygmomanometer wrapped around the&#xD;
      500-cm3 infusion bottle. As attached to a 250-W Xenon light source, the scope will be&#xD;
      introduced gently through the cervical canal and internal os. To perfectly perform&#xD;
      hysteroscopic tubal patency testing the following tricks should be followed. Clear view of&#xD;
      the endometrial cavity should be achieved on panoramic view by placing the hysteroscope at&#xD;
      internal os waiting for a while to achieve homogenous distension. The uterine cavity should&#xD;
      be systematically examined starting by its anterior and posterior walls, the fundus, and the&#xD;
      borders. Examination will be considered complete if the both tubal ostia will be reached&#xD;
      describing any gross pathology, e.g., septum, adhesions, polyp(s), myoma, and any growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the uterine cavity is normal the patient will be allocated as group A. If there is one or&#xD;
      more polyp(s) the patient will be allocated as group B. Localization and size estimation of&#xD;
      the polyp(s) is mandatory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prerequisites for a successful access to evaluate tubal patency include utilization of a 300&#xD;
      telescope with gaining skill of its rotation to reach both cornea and most importantly&#xD;
      orientation with a fundamental anatomic triad (Darwish triad) (DT). The most proximal corneal&#xD;
      fine wide circle is the ostium (the end of the endometrial cavity) representing a base of a&#xD;
      cone which is followed by a shallow conical groove (the first millimeters of the intramural&#xD;
      part of FT). Finally, a distal pinhole dark spot (the narrowest part of the FT) representing&#xD;
      the tip of the cone. Putting DT (ostium, intramural part and dark spot) in mind is the key&#xD;
      step to evaluate tubal patency and physiology via hysteroscopy. If DT is clearly accessible,&#xD;
      the hysteroscopist should comment on this. If there are some osteal lesions like tiny&#xD;
      polyp(s) or fine adhesions that may hinder proper evaluation of the tubal anatomy and&#xD;
      physiology, the hysteroscopist should notice and document. Passage of any air bubbles in the&#xD;
      irrigating fluid towards DT is reported. If no observed air bubbles, the hysteroscopist&#xD;
      should inject just 2 ml of air into the rubber end of the sterile infusion set. Hysteroscopic&#xD;
      bubble suction test is considered positive if air bubbles are sucked by DT within 1 min.&#xD;
      During this period, neither injection of air nor increased pressure will be done. If no&#xD;
      suction of gas bubbles occurred, the examiner should wait for 1 min more to exclude tubal&#xD;
      spasm. Again, if no suction of the bubbles by DT and their accumulation at the corneal end,&#xD;
      the test will be considered negative. Simultaneously, careful visualization of any change in&#xD;
      the shape of the ostium and intramural part of FT particularly during suction of the air&#xD;
      bubbles will be recorded in all cases. Tubal peristalsis is defined as observed osteal and&#xD;
      intramural tubal rhythmic opening and closing on maintained intrauterine pressure, i.e.,&#xD;
      periodic changes of DT in the form of widening followed by collapse on meticulous&#xD;
      observation. If the ostium and intramural part of the tube is obviously opened followed by&#xD;
      collapse and non-visualization of the pinhole dark spot of DT for a while, positive&#xD;
      peristalsis will be reported. The same steps will be repeated on the contralateral side and&#xD;
      reported.&#xD;
