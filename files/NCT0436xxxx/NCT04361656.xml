      This is a multicenter interrupted-time series study. The study will include patients between&#xD;
      the age of 18-85 year old, both males and females, who are scheduled for inpatient&#xD;
      colonoscopy procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be divided into two phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial phase will be a prospective review of inpatient colonoscopy procedure between&#xD;
      September, 1st 2020 and March, 31st 2021 to assess overall adequacy of inpatient colonoscopy&#xD;
      preparation and patient satisfaction at the three participating sites using standard of care&#xD;
      colonoscopy preparation prior to implement our intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention phase will take place between April, 1st 2021 and October 31st 2021, where&#xD;
      all patient undergoing inpatient colonoscopy procedures will receive Lubiprostone in addition&#xD;
      to large-volume PEG-ELS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be evaluated with colonoscopy the next day. The preparation quality will be&#xD;
      documented using the Boston Bowel Preparation Scale (BBPS).&#xD;

      2. INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND 2.1. Study rationale and aim An excellent bowel preparation is&#xD;
      crucial to perform a high-quality colonoscopy and essential to visualize the entire colonic&#xD;
      mucosa and to increase the safety of therapeutic maneuvers. Prior studies revealed that&#xD;
      inpatient setting was associated with higher rate of poor bowel preparation which led to&#xD;
      lower rate of procedure completion. The addition of Lubiprostone to standard PEG-ELS bowel&#xD;
      preparation for colonoscopy was evaluated in the outpatient setting and revealed&#xD;
      significantly better colon cleansing, decrease total length of procedure, and improved the&#xD;
      overall patient satisfaction with the preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this trial is to evaluate the effect of adding Lubiprostone to standard&#xD;
      large-volume PEG-ELS on the bowel preparation for inpatient colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.2. Background Colonoscopy is a procedure that permits direct visualization, examination and&#xD;
      treatment of the rectum, colon and terminal ileum. It can be used for both diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic purposes. In order to perform a high-quality colonoscopy examination, the&#xD;
      American Society of Gastrointestinal Endoscopy/American College of Gastroenterology Taskforce&#xD;
      on Quality in Endoscopy committee established a pre-, intra- and post-procedural quality&#xD;
      indicators. Bowel preparation is one of the most important pre-procedural indicators, as an&#xD;
      excellent preparation is crucial to visualize the entire colonic mucosa and to increase the&#xD;
      safety of therapeutic maneuvers. Multiple studies revealed rates of incomplete colonoscopy&#xD;
      between 10-20%, Sidhu et al revealed a rate of 7.8% of incomplete colonoscopies with&#xD;
      inadequate bowel preparation being the most common culprit. It has been reported that&#xD;
      inadequate or poor preparation occurs in 20-25% of colonoscopies in the United States. The&#xD;
      diagnostic yield, safety and quality indicators (adenoma detection rate, withdrawal time and&#xD;
      cecal intubation rate) of colonoscopy can be inversely affected by inadequate or poor bowel&#xD;
      preparation, as it can lead to: Increase procedural duration, cancel or repeat procedures,&#xD;
      increase health costs, a potential increase in complications and increase probability of&#xD;
      missing neoplastic lesions or adenomatous polyps (28-42% patients had adenomas on repeated&#xD;
      exam within 3 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Factors that can be associated with inadequate or poor bowel preparation has been evaluated&#xD;
      by researchers in order to improve this quality indicator. It has been shown that inadequate&#xD;
      preparation is more likely in the following situations: Inpatient status, prior inadequate&#xD;
      bowel preparation, advanced age, comorbidities (obesity, cirrhosis, stroke, dementia, and&#xD;
      Parkinson's), language barrier, polypharmacy, late colonoscopy starting time and failure to&#xD;
      follow preparation instructions. Ness et al and Almadi et al in their studies found that&#xD;
      inpatient setting was associated with higher rate of poor bowel preparation which led to&#xD;
      lower rate of procedure completion and terminal ileum intubation. An ideal bowel cleansing&#xD;
      preparation should be safe, tolerable, affordable, and can reliably empty the colon in a&#xD;
      timely fashion without altering the colonic mucosa histology. The large-volume polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol-electrolyte solution (PEG-ELS) is one of the most used FDA approved bowel preparation&#xD;
      methods. PEG-ELS is an inert polymer of ethylene oxide formulated as a non-absorbable&#xD;
      solution which is osmotically balanced with non-fermentable electrolyte solutions. It passes&#xD;
      through the gastrointestinal tract without net absorption, secretion, or significant effect&#xD;
      on fluid and electrolyte shift. Giving part of the bowel preparation does on the same day as&#xD;
      the colonoscopy (termed split-does) results in a higher quality colonoscopy examination&#xD;
      compared with ingestion of the entire preparation on the day or evening before colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As no available preparation has all of the ideal characteristics, studies evaluated the&#xD;
      effect of adding other medications to enhance the quality of the preparation. The routine&#xD;
      addition of prokinetic agents or bisacodyl to one of the standard regimens (Polyethylene&#xD;
      glycol-electrolyte solution) did not improve patient tolerance or colonic cleansing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lubiprostone is a derivative of prostaglandin E1 which has been shown to be effective in&#xD;
      treating Chronic Idiopathic Constipation, Opioid Induced Constipation and Irritable Bowel&#xD;
      Syndrome-Constipation (IBS-C). Lubiprostone works by stimulating and inducing the secretion&#xD;
      of chloride by activating chloride channel Type-2 and cyctic fibrosis transmembrane&#xD;
      conductance regulator chloride channels in the apical membrane of the intestinal epithelial&#xD;
      cells. Ultimately, the release of chloride ions from the cells into the intestinal lumen&#xD;
      results in increase fluidity within the lumen itself. Furthermore, the increase of fluid&#xD;
      contents within the lumen results in increase luminal distention which promotes the&#xD;
      gastrointestinal tract motility, resulting in an increase in intestinal and colonic transit.&#xD;
      By increasing the fluid content within the luminal wall and increasing intestinal and colonic&#xD;
      transit, the resultant benefit is softening of stool and rather rapid and facilitated&#xD;
      emptying of colonic contents which results in improvement in constipation and efficient&#xD;
      colonic emptying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Joel et al, and Banerjee et al evaluated the addition of Lubiprostone to standard PEG-ELS&#xD;
      bowel preparation for colonoscopy performed in the outpatient setting. They showed&#xD;
      significantly better colon cleansing, decreased total length of procedure, and improved&#xD;
      overall patient satisfaction with the preparation. Grigg et al revealed a trend toward&#xD;
      improved quality of colonoscopy preparation by adding two doses of Lubiprostone to standard&#xD;
      PEG in diabetic patients undergoing outpatient screening colonoscopy. Documentation of&#xD;
      quality of bowel preparation is an important post-procedural quality indicator. The Boston&#xD;
      Bowel Preparation Scale is one of the most commonly used validated systems in the literature&#xD;
      for documentation of the colonoscopy preparation. It is a 10-point (0-9) summation score&#xD;
      assessing bowel preparation quality in 3 segments of the colon after all cleansing maneuvers&#xD;
      during colonoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3. Risk/Benefit assessment 2.3.1. Known potential risks Lubiprostone is an approved and&#xD;
      licensed medication. The Product/Safety Information published on the company website&#xD;
      (https://www.amitiza.com/hcp/safety-indication/chronic-idiopathic-constipation) was used as&#xD;
      the primary source of the potential risks associated with Lubiprostone use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Lubiprostone is not for everyone&quot;. It is contraindicated in patients with known or suspected&#xD;
      mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction. It should be avoided in patients with severe&#xD;
      diarrhea and during pregnancy (unless the potential benefit justifies the potential risk to&#xD;
      the fetus). Caution should be exercised when it is administered to a nursing woman. These&#xD;
      were included as exclusion criteria. Syncope, hypotension and dyspnea have been reported&#xD;
      within an hour of the first dose or subsequent doses of Lubiprostone and generally resolve&#xD;
      prior to the next dose, but may recur with repeat dosing. In clinical trials of Lubiprostone&#xD;
      (24 microgram (mcg) twice daily vs placebo), the most common adverse reactions (incidence &gt;&#xD;
      4%) were nausea (29% vs 3%), diarrhea (12% vs 1%), headache (11% vs 5%), abdominal pain (8%&#xD;
      vs 3%), abdominal distension (6% vs 2%), and flatulence (6% vs 2%). There was no clinically&#xD;
      significant changes in serum electrolyte levels in adult patients with CIC receiving&#xD;
      Lubiprostone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other potential risks associated with PEG-ELS and colonoscopy procedure are not included in&#xD;
      this study protocol as they are considered part of the standard of care required for patient&#xD;
      evaluation and not part of this research study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2.3.2. Known potential benefits The addition of Lubiprostone to standard PEG-ELS bowel&#xD;
      preparation for colonoscopy was evaluated in the outpatient setting and revealed&#xD;
      significantly better colon cleansing, decrease total length of procedure, and improved the&#xD;
      overall patient satisfaction with the preparation. This would potentially result in reduce&#xD;
      health costs, decrease complications rate and enhance the accuracy of neoplastic lesions or&#xD;
      adenomatous polyp detection rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
