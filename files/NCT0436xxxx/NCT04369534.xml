  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The specific goal of this study is to determine whether the individualized approach and&#xD;
      adjusting the dosage of the P2Y12 receptor inhibitors will improve the platelet inhibiton and&#xD;
      the clinical outcome in patients with an ACS, that were treated with PCI and the&#xD;
      aforementioned drugs, but with an increased initial residual platelet activity. It is&#xD;
      expected that the patients that have undergone the P2Y12 inhibitor therapy adjustment&#xD;
      (according to the platelet reactivity measured by POC devices) will have better clinical&#xD;
      outcomes (ie less ischemic events, without a significant increase in bleeding events) than&#xD;
      those who did not undergo the therapy adjustment.&#xD;

      In this study we plan to continue our previous research on individualized approach to&#xD;
      platelet aniaggregation therapy in patients with an ACS treated with a PCI. The subjects&#xD;
      included in this study will be adult patients successfully treated in our department for ACS&#xD;
      (unstabile angina pectoris, non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction and ST segment&#xD;
      elevation myocardal infarction) with a PCI, a coronary stent implantation and the subsequent&#xD;
      dual platelet antiaggregation therapy combining ASA and a P2Y12 receptor inhibitor. The&#xD;
      diagnosis of different types of ACS will be made depending on the clinical presentation, ECG&#xD;
      findings and changes in cardiac biomarker serum levels (troponin T and MB creatinine kinase&#xD;
      isoezyme). Percutaneous coronary revascularization and the dual platelet antiaggregation&#xD;
      therapy are the basis of the modern ACS treatment. Because the newer P2Y12 receptor&#xD;
      inhibitors are not momentarily widely available in Croatia, the initial treatment will&#xD;
      include the combination of ASA and clopidogrel. The exclusion critera are as following:&#xD;
      postinterventional continuous GPIIb/IIIa inhibitor therapy, thrombocytopenia (&lt;150x10E9/L),&#xD;
      signifcant renal failure (creatinine&gt;200 Âµmol/L), anemia (Htc&lt;30%), hemorrhagic diathesis,&#xD;
      history of recent hemorrhagic or ischemic CVI (within 6 months of admission), recent surgical&#xD;
      procedure (within 6 weeks of admission) and an indication for chronic anticoagulant therapy.&#xD;
      Also patients older than 80 years of age will not be included into this study. The necessary&#xD;
      number of subjects is between 100 and 120.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aggregometry using the ADP test will be done to all the patients without the exclusion&#xD;
      criteria that were successfully treated wth PCI. The testing will be done within 24 hours of&#xD;
      the intervention in order to determine the pharmacodynamic effect P2Y12 receptor inhibitors&#xD;
      have on platelets and their reactivity. The optimal platelet reactivity (according to the&#xD;
      international consensus) is between 19 and 46 U (49). The patients that will have an&#xD;
      increased residual PR (&gt;46 U) after being given the loading doses of clopidogrel will be&#xD;
      included in this study and randomized into three groups using a computer software (Research&#xD;
      Randomizer). The patients randomized into the first group will be given the newer P2Y12&#xD;
      receptor inhibitor ticagrelor during the 12 months. The second group of patients will be&#xD;
      given ticagrelor initially, and after the first 30 days it will be replaced with clopidogrel,&#xD;
      that will be given for the remaining time period (up to 12 months). Clopidogrel dosing will&#xD;
      be modified according to the results of the aggregometry using the ADP test. The third group&#xD;
      of patients will have the same therapy regiment as the second group, but will be given the&#xD;
      standard doses of clopidogrel regardless of the aggregometry findings. The follow-up period,&#xD;
      during which the dual platelet antiaggregation therapy will be administered, is going to be&#xD;
      12 months for each patient. Within this time-frame, total of ten PR measurements will be&#xD;
      done. The measurements in the first month are scheduled as follows: on the first, second,&#xD;
      third, seventh and thirtieth day after the ACS and the PCI. The following measurements are&#xD;
      scheduled two, three, six, nine and twelve months after the ACS and the PCI.&#xD;
