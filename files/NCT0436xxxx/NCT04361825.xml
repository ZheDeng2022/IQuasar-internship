  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is a single arm, multi-center phase II study of durvalumab and AZD6738 combination&#xD;
      therapy in subjects with relapsed small cell lung cancer (SCLC) as a second or third line&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects will receive durvalumab and AZD6738 combination therapy. The arm is composed of 45&#xD;
      subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Durvalumab 1500mg via IV administered for every 4weeks(fixed dosing for subjects &gt; 30 kg body&#xD;
      weight) in Day 1 of each cycle and AZD 6738 240mg bid per os administered in each cycle days&#xD;
      15 and 28. One cycle is consisted of 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumour evaluation using CT or MRI, RECIST 1.1, CEA, NSE and LDH will be conducted at&#xD;
      screening (within 28days prior to first dose of Cycle1 Day1) and every 8weeks(±1week) for the&#xD;
      first 56weeks relative to the start of combination therapy(Cycle1 Day1), and thereafter every&#xD;
      12weeks(±1week) until objective disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study treatment will be continued until objective disease progression (unless other criteria&#xD;
      for treatment discontinuation are met). Subjects may continue durvalumab and AZD6738 beyond&#xD;
      progression(according to RECIST 1.1), at the discretion of the investigator if they are&#xD;
      clinically benefiting from the treatment and they do not meet any other discontinuation&#xD;
      criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a subjects discontinues study treatment prior to disease progression, they should continue&#xD;
      to be assessed using RECIST 1.1 until disease progression and then followed up for survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments for survival should be made every 3months following objective disease&#xD;
      progression. The details of first and subsequent therapies for cancer, after discontinuation&#xD;
      of durvalumab and AZD6738 treatment, will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The imaging modalities used for RECIST 1.1 assessment will be CT or MRI scans of chest,&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis. And CEA, NSE and LDH tests are also used for the evaluation. RECIST 1.1&#xD;
      scans will be analysed by the investigator on site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects may also be requested to provide tumour samples from the primary or metastatic&#xD;
      tumours on progression to understand resistance mechanisms. Sample provision is optional and&#xD;
      depend on the subject's will.&#xD;
