  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Asymptomatic men without pain due to prostate cancer progressing with metastatic CRPC after&#xD;
      treatment with combination or sequential ADT + Abi will be treated on a randomized, open&#xD;
      label study to determine if sequential treatment with high dose T and Enza will improve&#xD;
      primary and secondary objectives vs. continuous Enza as standard therapy.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Eligible patients are those who have progressive disease after treatment with Abi either in&#xD;
      combination with ADT as initial therapy or as second-line therapy after development of&#xD;
      resistance to primary ADT. Patients will continue on ADT with LHRH agonist (i.e. Zoladex,&#xD;
      Trelstar, Eligard or Lupron) or LHRH antagonist (Degarelix) if not surgically castrated&#xD;
      throughout the duration of the study to inhibit endogenous testosterone production. Patients&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:2:2 and stratified based on whether they received Abi in combination&#xD;
      with ADT or in sequence after progression on ADT and based on duration of response to Abi (&lt;6&#xD;
      or ≥ 6 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Arm A will receive continuous therapy with standard dose Enza (160 mg&#xD;
      po q day).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Arm B will receive Sequential Testosterone and Enzalutamide (STE).&#xD;
      Patients in Arm B will receive intramuscular injection with testosterone cypionate (T) at a&#xD;
      dose of 400 mg every 28 days x 2 (i.e. cycle 1). This dose was selected based on data&#xD;
      demonstrating that it produces an initial high dose serum level of T (i.e. &gt; 1500 ng/dL or&#xD;
      3-10 times normal level) with eugonadal levels achieved at the end of two weeks and near&#xD;
      castrate levels after 28 days. On Day 1 of cycle 2, patients will stop testosterone and begin&#xD;
      enzalutamide 160 mg po q day for 56 days. Each cycle is 56 days. On Day 1 of cycle 3, patient&#xD;
      will not take enzalutamide and will again receive injection of testosterone. Patients will&#xD;
      continue to alternate one cycle of testosterone (2 injections) with one cycle of 56 days of&#xD;
      enzalutamide.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients randomized to Arm C will receive Variable Sequential Testosterone and Enzalutamide&#xD;
      (VSTE). Patients in Arm C will receive intramuscular injection with testosterone cypionate&#xD;
      (T) at an FDA-approved dose of 400 mg every 28 days x 2 injections per cycle. Patients will&#xD;
      remain on high dose T for at least one cycle. Each cycle is 56 days. Patients with declining&#xD;
      PSA will remain on high dose T for additional cycles of 2 injections until PSA progression&#xD;
      occurs based on PCWG3 criteria. Patients with PSA progression (≥25% increase in PSA from&#xD;
      baseline) will stop T injection. These patients will then be started on Enzalutamide.&#xD;
      Patients on enzalutamide with PSA decline after one 56 day cycle will continue on&#xD;
      Enzalutamide until PSA progression occurs. Patients with PSA progression (≥25% increase in&#xD;
      PSA from baseline) will stop Enzalutamide and will restart injections of T with 2&#xD;
      injections/cycle. These cycles of switching between T and Enza with onset of PSA progression&#xD;
      will continue until clinical and/or radiographic progression occurs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will have prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level and symptoms assessment checked&#xD;
      every cycle. Every 2 cycles (~4 months) patients will have repeat bone/CT scans to evaluate&#xD;
      treatment response status. On CT scan, radiographic progression will be defined by RECIST&#xD;
      criteria (i.e. &gt;20% increase in the sum of target lesions). On bone scan, radiographic&#xD;
      progression will be defined by PCWG3 criteria as ≥ 2 new bone lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with PSA progression but with disease response or stable disease on imaging studies&#xD;
      will remain on study until clinical or radiographic progression criteria are met. Patients&#xD;
      with radiographic disease progression will stop treatment and come off study. Patients with&#xD;
      clinical progression due to pain flare after first two injection of testosterone can remain&#xD;
      on study. If pain persists after first cycle of enzalutamide, patients will stop treatment&#xD;
      and come off study. If pain resolves on enzalutamide, but returns with next or subsequent&#xD;
      cycles of testosterone, patients will stop treatment and come off study.&#xD;
