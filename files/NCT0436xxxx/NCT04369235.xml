  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial electrical stimulation (tCES) is contemporarily important issues in the advanced&#xD;
      rehabilitation medicine. tCES can selectively change the excitability of regional cortex with&#xD;
      non-invansive and safety properties. Therefore, the investigators aim to develop a set of&#xD;
      tCES system with special waveforms for using in clinical rehabilitation of upper extremities.&#xD;
      This developed tCES system is smaller than all commercial available products, which could be&#xD;
      conveniently and portably wore on head for clinical rehabilitation. In addition, the present&#xD;
      tCES system with special waveforms developing by the investigators is much more efficient on&#xD;
      improving neuroplasticity than the traditional transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS)&#xD;
      in rats. The investigators hope the tCES system combined with the rehabilitation of body&#xD;
      extremities will become a routine treatment for stroke patients at hospitals or residential&#xD;
      rehabilitation in the future.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) and intermittent theta burst stimulation&#xD;
      (iTBS) were both demonstrated to have therapeutic potentials to rapidly induce neuroplastic&#xD;
      effects in various rehabilitation training regimens. Recently, the investigators have&#xD;
      developed a novel transcranial electrostimulation device that can flexibly output an&#xD;
      electrical current with combined tDCS and iTBS waveforms. However, limited studies have&#xD;
      determined the therapeutic effects of this special waveform combination on clinical&#xD;
      rehabilitation. Herein, the investigators aiming to brain stimulation effects of tDCS-iTBS on&#xD;
      upper-limb motor function in chronic stroke patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Twenty-four subjects with a chronic stroke were randomly assigned to a real non-invasive&#xD;
      brain stimulation (NIBS; subjects received the real tDCS+iTBS output) group or a sham NIBS&#xD;
      (subjects received sham tDCS+iTBS output) group. All subjects underwent 1 h treatment of a&#xD;
      conventional rehabilitation program (3 days a week for 6 weeks), where a 20-min NIBS&#xD;
      intervention was simultaneously applied during conventional rehabilitation. Outcome measures&#xD;
      were assessed before and immediately after the intervention period: Fugl-Meyer&#xD;
      Assessment-Upper Extremity (FMA-UE), Jebsen-Taylor Hand Function Test (JTT), and&#xD;
      Finger-to-Nose Test (FNT).&#xD;

    <description>The FMA-UE was performed (score ranges from 0 to 66) to assess upper limb motor recovery. Each movement is estimated by a 3-point scale (0-1-2). The total score of the FMA-UE is 66, and a higher score indicates that the patient has better movement ability.</description>

    <time_frame>Baseline (within 7 days ahead to the 1st intervention session) and after 6-week intervention (within 7 days after the last intervention session)</time_frame>
    <description>The JTT assesses hand functions commonly used in activities of daily living. The subtests are scored according to time taken to complete the task. Total score is the sum of time taken for each subtest, with shorter times indicating better performance.</description>

    <description>The Finger to Nose Test assesses coordination of upper-extremity movement. The number of complete nose-target movements during a 1 min period will be recorded.</description>
