      The overall objective of this study is to identify the best strategy to eliminate unnecessary&#xD;
      antibiotic use after surgery in pediatric surgical procedures considered low-risk for an SSI.&#xD;
      Based on literature and our preliminary data suggesting surgeons will not fully accept&#xD;
      standardized order sets based on current guidelines, the investigators hypothesize that order&#xD;
      set modification combined with ASP facilitation will outperform standard order set&#xD;
      modification alone in de-implementing unnecessary postoperative antibiotic use.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Antibiotics have revolutionized healthcare allowing clinicians the ability to treat&#xD;
      life-threatening infections and to prevent infections following life-saving surgery.&#xD;
      Unfortunately, antibiotic overuse results in antibiotic resistant bacteria and unnecessary&#xD;
      adverse events including Clostridioides difficile infections (CDI). Data demonstrate that&#xD;
      antibiotic resistant bacteria and CDI annually kill up to 150,000 and 29,000 Americans,&#xD;
      respectively. Surgical antibiotic prophylaxis is a common area for unnecessary antibiotic use&#xD;
      among children. Recent CDC surgical site infection (SSI) guidelines and the AAP Choosing&#xD;
      Wisely Campaign recommend no postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis for procedures considered&#xD;
      low risk for an SSI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, our team will develop and test two theoretically informed strategies to&#xD;
      eliminate (&quot;de-implement&quot;) unnecessary postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis through the&#xD;
      collaboration of surgeons and antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs). One promising&#xD;
      strategy is the implementation of standard surgical order sets, which offer relative ease of&#xD;
      implementation and a systematic approach across surgical subspecialties. While evidence&#xD;
      suggests that order set standardization is a good approach, barriers to implementation are&#xD;
      commonly noted, especially the lack of engagement with clinicians affected by change when&#xD;
      initiating a new strategy. As such, complementary strategies are needed to extend the impact&#xD;
      of order set standardization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will be guided by the i-PARIHS framework (Integrated Framework for Promoting&#xD;
      Action on Research Implementation in Health Services), an implementation science framework&#xD;
      designed to guide implementation of evidence-based practices. This framework posits that&#xD;
      successful implementation of evidence into practice is a function of the quality and type of&#xD;
      evidence to be implemented, the characteristics of the context where the evidence will be&#xD;
      implemented, and the means by which it is integrated or facilitated into practice. Four&#xD;
      primary constructs comprise the i-PARIHS framework: the innovation, recipients, context, and&#xD;
      facilitation. Innovation describes the evidence and knowledge regarding a particular issue,&#xD;
      as well as the qualities of the evidence that may influence how it is perceived by the&#xD;
      potential user, recognizing that evidence may or may not be valuable to the end user based on&#xD;
      local circumstances and priorities. Recipients are actors involved in implementation who may&#xD;
      be affected by and influence the implementation of evidence. Context characterizes the&#xD;
      circumstances in which knowledge and innovation uptake occurs, consisting of multiple factors&#xD;
      at the micro, meso, and macro levels. Finally, integral to this framework is facilitation as&#xD;
      the active mechanism by which uptake and implementation of evidence occurs, making it an&#xD;
      ideal and appropriate fit for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All research activities for this study will be conducted in 9 children's hospitals that&#xD;
      participate in both the SHARPS Collaborative and NSQIP-P. Our participating hospitals are&#xD;
      geographically dispersed and (like most children's hospitals) are located in urban settings.&#xD;
      SHARPS Collaborative hospitals feature active ASPs operated by dedicated pharmacists and&#xD;
      physician leaders. Clinicians (MD/DO or PharmD) overseeing ASPs and surgical champions in&#xD;
      participating hospitals will implement the proposed strategies and collect implementation&#xD;
      outcomes that quantify the extent to which the test strategies are successfully deployed in&#xD;
      the hospital. The daily work of these individuals to improve antibiotic use includes frequent&#xD;
      interaction with surgical specialties that perform clean and clean-contaminated surgeries.&#xD;
      Implementing our proposed strategies via established ASP clinicians and a surgical leader&#xD;
      (rather than, for example, directly by a member of the research team) will leverage existing&#xD;
      relationships between these clinicians and their associated surgical teams, creating a more&#xD;
      realistic circumstance under which new ASP strategies are implemented. This approach will&#xD;
      provide better insight into the feasibility of implementing these strategies in a sustainable&#xD;
      way in the future. In addition to being SHARPS Collaborative hospitals, our participating&#xD;
      hospitals will also be NSQIP-P hospitals, each with a full-time, trained dedicated data&#xD;
      abstractor collecting data on surgeries and surgical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will compare the efficacy of the two strategies designed to reduce&#xD;
      unnecessary postoperative antibiotic prophylaxis, using a cross-sectional stepped-wedge&#xD;
      design. The investigators have identified 9 Children's Hospitals from across the US to&#xD;
      participate in the study. Each of the 9 hospitals will be randomized into one of 3 clusters&#xD;
      (cluster size = 3). All hospitals will begin with the control intervention-implementation of&#xD;
      order set review and modification-at time 0. Each Step will last 6 months. Prior to the&#xD;
      beginning of Step 1, Cluster 1 hospitals will receive the experimental intervention -order&#xD;
      set review and modification plus facilitation. Just prior to steps 1, 2 and 3, the ASP teams&#xD;
      will receive a 2-day in-person workshop led by the implementation scientist (Co-I Dr. McKay)&#xD;
      and PI Dr. Newland, covering the specific facilitation strategies to be utilized. Every 6&#xD;
      months, an additional cluster will initiate the experimental condition (Steps 2 and 3). The&#xD;
      amount of time each cluster will receive the experimental condition will be 30 months&#xD;
      (Cluster 1), 24 months (Cluster 2), and 18 months (Cluster 3). Monthly study webinars will&#xD;
      occur with all sites in step 0. During steps 1 and 2, sites in the experimental arm will have&#xD;
      a monthly webinar separate from the group still in the control arm. By step 3 all sites will&#xD;
      be a part of the same monthly webinar.&#xD;
