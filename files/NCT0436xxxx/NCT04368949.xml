  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Preclinical mobility limitations (PCML) manifest early in the process of declining mobility,&#xD;
      and are not typically identified or acted upon by clinicians. These mobility limitations&#xD;
      manifest as changes in how daily tasks such as walking are performed (slower speed, lower&#xD;
      endurance). Persons in the PCML stage are at increased risk for the onset of disability and&#xD;
      chronic disease. Persistent deterioration in mobility is a predictor of mortality and has&#xD;
      been reported even in the absence of changes in activities of daily living over a two-year&#xD;
      period. Further, older persons with mobility limitations, including reduced gait speed, are&#xD;
      at risk for falls. These cumulative transitions of a person's life-long mobility form their&#xD;
      mobility trajectory and preventing mobility decline at an early stage along this trajectory&#xD;
      is the focus of this research initiative. This study will evaluate a novel intervention,&#xD;
      STEPPING-UP, for improving walking ability in persons with PCML.&#xD;
