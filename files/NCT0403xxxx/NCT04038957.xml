      This is a single-site, open-label, flexibly-dosed study evaluating the effect on brain&#xD;
      dopamine synthesis capacity as measured by 18F-DOPA PET imaging of adjunctive open-label&#xD;
      administration of SEP-363856 (50 to 75 mg/day) over 2 weeks in adults with schizophrenia. The&#xD;
      study will consist of 3 periods: Screening (up to 28 days), Treatment (2 weeks), and a&#xD;
