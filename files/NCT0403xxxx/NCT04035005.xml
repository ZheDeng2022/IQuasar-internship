  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the efficacy and safety of ocrelizumab ( Ocrevus®) compared with&#xD;
      placebo in participants with primary progressive multiple sclerosis (PPMS), including&#xD;
      participants later in their disease course. This study focuses on upper limit disability&#xD;
      progression. This study will consist of the following phases: screening, double-blind&#xD;
      treatment, follow-up 1 (FU1), an optional open-label extension (OLE), follow-up 2 (FU2), and&#xD;
      B-cell monitoring (BCM).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The screening phase will last up to 24 weeks. In the double-blind treatment phase,&#xD;
      participants will undergo at least 120 weeks of study treatment. Study drug (ocrelizumab or&#xD;
      placebo) will be administered every 24 weeks. In the FU1 phase, all participants who&#xD;
      discontinue prematurely from the double-blind treatment phase will enter the FU1 phase,&#xD;
      including participants who receive post-double progression ocrelizumab (PDP OCR) treatment,&#xD;
      other immunomodulatory or immunosuppressive treatment(s) for MS, commercial ocrelizumab, or&#xD;
      no treatment. The FU1 phase will run in parallel with the double-blind treatment phase until&#xD;
      the primary analysis is performed. If the primary analysis is positive, an optional OLE phase&#xD;
      is planned for eligible participants who either have remained in the double-blind treatment&#xD;
      phase or are on PDP OCR treatment at the time of the primary analysis and, in the opinion of&#xD;
      the investigator, could benefit from ocrelizumab treatment. The follow-up 2 (FU2) phase will&#xD;
      begin after the primary analysis is performed. The following participants will move into the&#xD;
      FU2 phase: participants who are ongoing in the FU1 and not on PDP OCR treatment at the time&#xD;
      of primary analysis; participants who are ongoing in the double-blind treatment phase or&#xD;
      receiving PDP OCR at the time of the primary analysis and do not enter the OLE phase;&#xD;
      participants who complete or withdraw from the OLE phase. At the end of the FU2, all&#xD;
      participants will move into B-cell monitoring (BCM) phase until the end of the study. This&#xD;
      study will end when all participants who are not being treated with an alternative B-cell&#xD;
      depleting therapy have repleted his or her B-cells.&#xD;
