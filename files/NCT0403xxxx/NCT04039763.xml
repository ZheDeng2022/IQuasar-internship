  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pilot study to evaluate the effect of real time continuous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) on&#xD;
      young-adults with insulin-treated diabetes, who are defined as high risk due to suboptimal&#xD;
      HbA1c (blood glucose control) or a history of hospital admissions for high blood glucoses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: RT-CGM provided to young adults with suboptimal blood glucose control, has a&#xD;
      beneficial impact on HbA1c and hospital admissions for high blood glucoses. We will use data&#xD;
      from this pilot work to inform a larger powered study to address this knowledge gap.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Real time continous glucose monitoring (RT-CGM) is a technology that measures people's sugar&#xD;
      level all the time, using a sensor that is placed on the skin. The sensor can be worn for 10&#xD;
      days and the small transmitter clicks into the sensor and sends the glucose readings&#xD;
      wirelessly to a smartphone or a small handset, which displays the glucose level on the&#xD;
      screen. It also has alarms to tell people when their sugar level is too high or too low. This&#xD;
      study uses the Dexcom G6 RT-CGM system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RT-CGM devices have become smaller and can connect easily with mobile phones. We want to find&#xD;
      out whether young people, in particular, find the technology useful and whether it improves&#xD;
      how they self-managed their diabetes over a 6-month period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomised controlled cross over trial; participants are randomly assigned to the&#xD;
      control group (standard care which is self-monitoring of blood glucose via fingerprick) or&#xD;
      the intervention group (RT-CGM) for the first 6 months and then cross over for the 2nd 6&#xD;
      months. Participants will be able to share their CGM data if they wish via Dexcom Clarity&#xD;
      with the research/clinical team, who will support them in making treatment decisions in light&#xD;
      of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will be asked to take part in a semi-structured interview with a Diabetes&#xD;
      Specialist Clinical Psychologist at baseline, including to address some of the barriers to&#xD;
      self-management and a further interview at the end of the 6 months during which they use RT-&#xD;
      CGM, to explore their experiences using it. All participants will be asked to complete&#xD;
      validated psychology questionnaires at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. A blood test for&#xD;
      HbA1C will be done at baseline, 6 months and 12 months. After 12 months, all participants&#xD;
      will be invited to attend a focus group to provide feedback &amp; share their experiences of&#xD;
      using RT-CGM and raise themes brought up in psychology interviews to the whole group.&#xD;
