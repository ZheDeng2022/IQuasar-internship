  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a multisystem disease with diverse manifestations, including&#xD;
      progressive neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, respiratory disease, and genomic&#xD;
      instability. One of the most important features of A-T is the increased predisposition to&#xD;
      cancer, especially to lymphoid malignancies. Patients with A-T are generally excluded from&#xD;
      collaborative clinical trials, their treatment outcomes and toxicity profiles have rarely&#xD;
      been reported, and little is currently known concerning the treatment intensity required to&#xD;
      provide a reasonable balance between efficacy and toxicity. The aims of this study are to&#xD;
      build a large international de-identified database of children with A-T treated for leukemia&#xD;
      and lymphoma, to investigate epidemiology and outcome of treatment, toxicity profiles and&#xD;
      risk factors which impact outcome, in order to eventually enable the generation of data-based&#xD;
      treatment recommendations for this population.&#xD;

      Ataxia telangiectasia (A-T) is a multisystem disease with diverse manifestations, including&#xD;
      progressive neurodegeneration, immunodeficiency, respiratory disease, and genomic&#xD;
      instability. A-T is caused by biallelic mutations in the ATM gene, a major activator of the&#xD;
      cellular response to DNA double strand breaks. One of the most important features of A-T is&#xD;
      the increased predisposition to cancer. Lymphoid malignancies represent the majority of&#xD;
      cancers. The treatment of cancer in children with A-T is extremely challenging, due to severe&#xD;
      co-morbidities and a significantly increased risk of cancer therapy-related toxicities.&#xD;
      Patients with A-T are generally excluded from collaborative clinical trials, their treatment&#xD;
      outcomes and toxicity profiles have rarely been reported, and little is currently known&#xD;
      concerning the treatment intensity required to provide a reasonable balance between efficacy&#xD;
      and toxicity. The optimal treatment approach is controversial; some advocate treatment by&#xD;
      standard chemotherapeutic protocols, while others advise initial protocol modifications with&#xD;
      chemotherapy dose reductions. Due to the rarity of this disorder, there is an unmet need for&#xD;
      an international collaboration for data collection concerning treatment, toxicity and outcome&#xD;
      in children with cancer and A-T. Data will be collected from patient files, including patient&#xD;
      characteristics and history, AT manifestations, malignancy characteristics, treatment,&#xD;
      chemotherapy doses, treatment response, toxicity and outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aims of the study are to build a large international de-identified database of children&#xD;
      with A-T treated for leukemia and lymphoma, to investigate epidemiology and outcome of&#xD;
      treatment, toxicity profiles and risk factors which impact outcome, in order to eventually&#xD;
      enable the generation of data-based treatment recommendations for this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will not involve the use of specimens or participant contact. All the data&#xD;
      required have already been collected during the treatment of the participants, and is&#xD;
      available in patient records.&#xD;
