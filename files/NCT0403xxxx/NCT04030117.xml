  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Successful restoration of cavities in primary molars can be considered challenging. It is&#xD;
      different from restoring cavities in permanent molars because factors such as the level of&#xD;
      co-operation of the child and the handling properties and setting time of the restorative&#xD;
      material will have some influence on the success rate of the restoration. The ideal&#xD;
      requirements that a filling material should possess include that it bears the occlusal force,&#xD;
      withstands the acidic and bacterial attack, survives in the oral environment in addition to&#xD;
      being biocompatible with the oral tissues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In an attempt to achieve this idealism, a new class of restorative materials known as&#xD;
      &quot;bioactive materials&quot; has been developed. The concept of bioactive materials was introduced&#xD;
      in 1969 and later defined as &quot;one that elicits a specific biological response at the&#xD;
      interface of the material which results in the formation of a bond between tissues and the&#xD;
      material.&quot; An example of bioactive materials is ACTIVA™ BioACTIVE (Pulpdent, USA). These&#xD;
      materials are ionic composite resins which combine the biocompatibility, chemical bond and&#xD;
      the ability to release fluoride of glass ionomers with the mechanical properties, esthetic&#xD;
      and durability of composite resins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Compomer is widely accepted as a standard restorative material for primary dentition for&#xD;
      Class I and II cavities. Its range of success rate in Class II restorations in primary molars&#xD;
      is 78-96%. Many randomized clinical trials have reported comparable clinical performance to&#xD;
      composite resin with respect to color matching, marginal discoloration, anatomical form,&#xD;
      marginal integrity and secondary caries. In comparison to glass ionomer and Resin Modified&#xD;
      Glass Ionomer, compomers tend to have better physical properties in the primary dentition.&#xD;
      However, their cariostatic properties didn't differ significantly from those materials.&#xD;

      1. Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           The null hypothesis is that there is no difference between using ACTIVA and Dyract® in&#xD;
           children to restore Class II cavities in carious vital primary second molars.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Trial design:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  A pilot study, parallel group, two arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Allocation ratio is 1:1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) Diagnosis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnostic chart will be filled with personal, medical and dental history.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The intra-oral examination will be made using gloves, mask, gauze and dental mirror.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A pre-operative radiograph (bitewing) will be taken for diagnosis. b) The intervention&#xD;
           in this pilot study will be (ACTIVA™ BioACTIVE, Pulpdent, USA) - Gp1 while the&#xD;
           comparator will be (Dyract® DENTSPLY, Germany)- Gp2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three follow up visits for restoration at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      T1 (3 months), T2 (6 months) and T3 (12 months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Same procedure in both groups will be followed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The tooth will be anesthetized using local anesthesia, and isolated using rubber dam.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Caries will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A proximal box is prepared.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A metal matrix band is fixed around the tooth and a wedge is placed interdentally.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. The restorative material chosen according to the randomization is placed in the cavity&#xD;
           according to the manufacturer's instructions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. A post-operative digital bitewing radiograph will be taken immediately after the&#xD;
           treatment as a base line reference and to check for voids or any defect in the&#xD;
           restoration.&#xD;
