  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to evaluate the outcomes and processes of a video and web-based&#xD;
      worksite exercise intervention for sedentary office workers in China.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intervention is informed by behaviour change theory, and is a digital workplace&#xD;
      intervention (called Move-It) involving a 10-minute Qigong exercise session (video&#xD;
      demonstration via website) which is delivered twice a day at set break times during the&#xD;
      working day for 12 consecutive weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The setting is a large organisation with 2 sites (in Beijing and Guangzhou). The objectives&#xD;
      are to examine the effect of a video-based intervention on employees' physical activity, time&#xD;
      spent sitting and work performance. This is tested in a 2-group, randomised wait-list control&#xD;
      trial. This means that employees at one site receive the intervention first (site 1 -&#xD;
      intervention group), and when they have completed (12 weeks later), the other site then&#xD;
      receives the same intervention (site 2 - wait-list control). At the end of the intervention,&#xD;
      there is a process evaluation with the intervention group which includes focus groups with&#xD;
      employees and managers to gather information about the way in which the intervention was&#xD;
      implemented. The process evaluation is based on a framework called 'Reach Effectiveness&#xD;
      Adoption Implementation Maintenance' (RE-AIM). Data were collected at baseline (before the&#xD;
      intervention began) and after 12 weeks in both groups.&#xD;

      Aim The aim of the study is to deliver a digital video-based worksite exercise intervention&#xD;
      in China and conduct outcome and process evaluation. The objectives are: [1] to examine the&#xD;
      effect of a video-based intervention on physical activity (PA) and weekday sitting hours&#xD;
      (individual level); [2] to examine the effect of a video-based intervention on individual&#xD;
      work performance (individual level); [3] to conduct a process evaluation of the intervention&#xD;
      implementation (individual and cluster level).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design This is a 2-arm cluster-randomised wait-list control trial, with outcomes assessed in&#xD;
      two groups: intervention and wait-list control (objectives 1 and 2).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clusters (sites) will be randomly allocated to groups at 1:1 ratio using computer-generated&#xD;
      random number sequence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Setting 2 sites of a major organisation in China (one in Beijing, one in Guangzhou), with a&#xD;
      total of 490 employees.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Data will be collected through online questionnaires emailed to all employee&#xD;
      participants (Time 1 = T1). Employees in both groups will complete a second online&#xD;
      questionnaire (Time 2 = T2). For the intervention group T2 will be immediately&#xD;
      post-intervention, for the wait-list control group this will be just prior to receiving the&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size At an individual level, the estimated sample size is a minimum 72 for&#xD;
      intervention group and 72 for control group, alpha 0.05, beta 0.2 and power 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention This digital intervention consists of a series of six video clips demonstrating&#xD;
      Qigong exercises designed to be undertaken at set exercise break times during the working&#xD;
      day. The intervention includes a specially designed logo and selected images to be used on&#xD;
      promotional posters and a dedicated 'Move-It' webpage. The six promotional videos are&#xD;
      designed to be posted in sequence, one every two weeks, on the Move-It website. A Move-It&#xD;
      icon on each employee's desktop computer screen will be scheduled to pop up twice a day as a&#xD;
      prompt to interrupt sitting. The intervention is designed to be completed within 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures Self-report measures of PA, work performance and weekday sitting hours are taken at&#xD;
      T1 (baseline) and T2 (12 week follow-up).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis Intervention outcome data will be analysed using the Statistical Package for&#xD;
      the Social Sciences (IBM SPSS) Version 24.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes will be compared between the pre- and post-intervention time points. Intracluster&#xD;
      correlations and estimated effects sizes will be presented for each outcome. Data from both&#xD;
      clusters will be included in all analyses, and analysis is by intention-to-treat.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Process evaluation Will take place at the end of the intervention (intervention site only).&#xD;
      This will include up to 6 focus groups (up to n=35) with employees (both participants and&#xD;
      non-participants), organisational committee members and senior management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These will be aligned with the RE-AIM framework to explore intervention reach, effectiveness,&#xD;
      adoption, implementation and maintenance.&#xD;
