      This study prospectively investigates the safety, FVIII immunogenicity, and hemostatic&#xD;
      efficacy of prophylactic HEMLIBRA® given with a concomitant low dose recombinant factor VIII&#xD;
      (rFVIII) known as NUWIQ®, in HA infants and children &lt;3 years old who have had little to no&#xD;
      previous exposure to FVIII. In addition, the study investigates the safety and efficacy of a&#xD;
      novel FVIII ITI regimen in children &lt;21 with existing low and high titer inhibitors (LTI and&#xD;
      HTI).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemophilia A (HA) is a congenital bleeding disorder caused by deficient or dysfunctional&#xD;
      factor VIII (FVIII) which leads to bleeding correlated with severity. Management is focused&#xD;
      on FVIII replacement in reaction to a bleed or preventive as prophylaxis. Effective treatment&#xD;
      is complicated by the: (1) difficulty to administer standard replacement therapy via&#xD;
      intravenous injection especially in infants and young children; and (2) development of&#xD;
      inhibitors (FVIII neutralizing antibodies). Inhibitors can increase morbidity and mortality&#xD;
      and exponentially raise the cost of health care. Although inherited and environmental risk&#xD;
      factors for inhibitor formation have been identified, there is no effective strategy to&#xD;
      prevent inhibitors from developing. Emicizumab (HEMLIBRA®) was recently approved by the Food&#xD;
      and Drug Administration (FDA) in infants, children, and adults with congenital hemophilia A,&#xD;
      with and without inhibitors, and offers hemostatic efficacy while reducing the burden of&#xD;
      administration since it is given weekly, biweekly (every 2 weeks), or monthly via&#xD;
      subcutaneous (SQ) route compared to the intravenous (IV) route of FVIII.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study prospectively investigates the safety, FVIII immunogenicity, and hemostatic&#xD;
      efficacy of prophylactic HEMLIBRA® given with a concomitant low dose recombinant factor VIII&#xD;
      (rFVIII) known as NUWIQ®, in HA infants and children &lt;3 years old who have had little to no&#xD;
      previous exposure to FVIII. In addition, the study investigates the safety and efficacy of a&#xD;
      novel FVIII ITI regimen in children &lt;21 with existing low and high titer inhibitors (LTI and&#xD;
      HTI).&#xD;
