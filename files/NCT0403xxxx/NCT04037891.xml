      Topical rVA576 for treatment of atopic keratoconjunctivitis: a randomised placebo-controlled&#xD;
      double masked parallel trial (TRACKER)&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recombinant rVA576 is a small protein (16.7kDa) which has two independent actions. It&#xD;
      inhibits the activation and cleavage of complement C5 and it binds and inactivates&#xD;
      leukotriene B4 (LTB4). It acts on the complement system by preventing the cleavage of C5 by&#xD;
      C5 convertase into C5a and C5b and so is effective in inhibiting terminal complement activity&#xD;
      irrespective of the activating pathway.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Atopic keratoconjunctivitis (AKC) is a type of allergic conjunctivitis which involves mast&#xD;
      cell activation due to the predominance of inflammatory mediators such as eosinophils and&#xD;
      Th2-generated cytokines (Mishra et al. 2011).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant rVA576 eye drops solution is the investigational medicinal product. It is&#xD;
      intended for ophthalmic use by topical administration to the eye.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recombinant rVA576 is a compact small protein molecule with a lipocalin-like structure&#xD;
      consisting of alpha helices and a beta barrel. There is a surface-active site which binds to&#xD;
      the complement C5 molecule with a high affinity (KD 1.85 x 10-8 M) and an internalised active&#xD;
      site which binds the small eicosinoid molecule leukotriene B4 (Hepburn et al. 2007).&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    The trial has terminated early due to the disruptions caused by the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.&#xD;
    The decision was not related to any efficacy, safety or clinical concerns regarding&#xD;
    rVA576/Coversin.&#xD;

    <description>Part 1: The first 3 patients selected for the study will be treated with the active drug in an open-label manner at intervals of 1 week and will have weekly clinic visits until Day 14, after which the visit will be every two weeks. When the first 3 patients have completed two weeks of treatment and the safety and tolerability data has been reviewed by the PI and an independent clinician, provided the data is favourable the randomisation process will begin (Part 2). The first 3 patients will continue treatment for a total of 8 weeks and will be assessed throughout the trial by the Principal Investigator according to the Schedule of Events Part 2: Sixteen patients will be randomised 1:1. between active and placebo and patients allocated to either group will receive the appropriate product throughout the trial.</description>
