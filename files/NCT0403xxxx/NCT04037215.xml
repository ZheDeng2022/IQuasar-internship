  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In order to explore the cognitive treatment of patients with early onset anorexia nervosa&#xD;
      (AM) in front of images of silhouettes and food, we will use the eye-tracking method. While&#xD;
      we hypothesize a judgment disorder in these patients, the exploration of implicit cognitive&#xD;
      treatment without desirability bias is essential. Eye-tracking is a method of recording the&#xD;
      eye path that provides qualitative and quantitative information on the visual exploration of&#xD;
      subjects. The visual pathway depends on how the subject's attention is directed to a given&#xD;
      stimulus, but also on certain cognitive traits (e.g., excessive attention to details) or&#xD;
      symptoms (e.g., avoidance of caloric food images or attraction to thin images). It is&#xD;
      therefore a non-invasive exploration tool, which provides information on how patients look at&#xD;
      food images and silhouettes. This project will describe the cognitive treatment of dietary&#xD;
      stimuli and body image in young patients with early onset AM. It could identify a biomarker&#xD;
      of AM in the pediatric population and improve the diagnosis of the disease. A better&#xD;
      diagnosis of AM in patients under 15 years of age is essential and will improve medical care&#xD;
      and develop personalized medicine.&#xD;

      Monocentric, prospective cohort, case-control type study. The population concerned is&#xD;
      composed of patients with early onset anorexia nervosa (AM) and control subjects (two&#xD;
      groups).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objectives of this study are to:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the cognitive treatment of early-onset AM patients with specific stimuli of the&#xD;
      disorder (eating and body images) compared to age- and sex-matched control subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children controls not achieved with normal body mass index(BMI);&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  children with unbalanced insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes, therefore subject to a&#xD;
           strict diet that requires good nutritional knowledge and no weight judgment disorders.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Describe the links between cognitive treatment and clinical phenotype in patients with early&#xD;
      onset AM, in particular severity of eating behaviour trouble symptomatology (TCA),&#xD;
      psychiatric and somatic comorbidities, neuropsychological profile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      30 patients with early-onset AM. Two groups of control subjects (matched for age and gender):&#xD;
      30 subjects from the general population with a normal Body Mass Index (BMI) and 30 subjects&#xD;
      with chronic somatic pathology (type 1 diabetes) without weight variation (good knowledge of&#xD;
      dietary caloric values without impaired judgment about the caloric value of foods and&#xD;
      representation of the body image of self and others) A total of 90 participantsPatients and&#xD;
      controls without eating disorders will be recruited at Robert Debré Hospital, after signature&#xD;
      of the authorization by the holder(s) of parental authority present at the time of&#xD;
      hospitalization All patients treated in the department benefit from extensive phenotypic&#xD;
      exploration, carried out in routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For controls, phenotypic exploration will require a half-day evaluation.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>All assessments in patients with AM are performed as part of routine care and do not require additional monitoring modalities added by research.&#xD;
For controls, phenotypic exploration will require a consultation with clinical examination including the search for psychiatric comorbidities and the completion of standardized questionnaires, exploration of the neuropsychological profile (with eye tracking, overall cognitive exploration, executive functions, social cognition and self-esteem).&#xD;
Test results will not be returned except for screening requiring specific management. The information will then be returned to the child's parents by the investigating doctor, who will be responsible for organizing specific care whenever it is necessary.</intervention_model_description>

    <description>In order to explore the cognitive treatment of patients with early onset anorexia nervosa in front of images of silhouettes and food, it is currently used in the child psychiatry department of the Robert Debré Hospital, the eye-tracking method. Eye tracking is a non-invasive and painless method of recording the path of vision on images presented on a computer screen. In order to understand the specificities of the eye path in sick patients, we will compare the data with those of controls without eating disorders.</description>
