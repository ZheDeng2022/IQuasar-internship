    <textblock>
      Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is a vitamin-like substance produced in all living human cells and&#xD;
      naturally occurring in dietary sources. In addition to being responsible for the synthesis of&#xD;
      adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a major source of energy, CoQ10 plays an essential role in&#xD;
      maintaining several biochemical pathways of the human body: i) it acts as a primary scavenger&#xD;
      of free radicals, and ii) it protects membranes phospholipids from peroxidation and membranes&#xD;
      proteins and mitochondrial DNA from oxidative damage. Despite the potential impact that it&#xD;
      has shown in a wide array of health conditions, CoQ10 has been reported to have a poor&#xD;
      bioavailability in humans with a slow and incomplete absorption from the small intestine.&#xD;
      This has been attributed to its high molecular weight, strongly lipophilic nature and low&#xD;
      aqueous solubility. To overcome the above limitations, various drug delivery systems such as&#xD;
      liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles,&#xD;
      nanostructured lipid carriers, self-emulsifying systems, nanoemulsions and solid and aqueous&#xD;
      dispersions have been explored and developed to improve the solubility, the absorption and&#xD;
      the bioavailability of CoQ10. Even though these different technologies and delivery systems&#xD;
      were able to improve the absorption of CoQ10 and increase its bioavailability, the carriers&#xD;
      used to deliver CoQ10 are based on synthetic products with no health benefits attributed to&#xD;
      them. Aligned with its mission and vision to provide its clients with wellness products,&#xD;
      Biodroga Neutraceuticals Inc developped a CoQ10 product using its patented MaxSimil&#xD;
      technology that is based on omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) and this health product will be&#xD;
      serving as the carrier for CoQ10. Therefore, the aim of this study is to perform a PK study&#xD;
      using a powder product of CoQ10 and a rice bran oil + CoQ10 forms as comparators to the&#xD;
      MaxSimil® + CoQ10 omega-3 supplement and compare their bioavailability and side effects. In&#xD;
      this context, a randomized crossover design with a minimum of 7 days of washout between&#xD;
      treatments will be used. The MaxSimil® + CoQ10 formulation is anticipated to provide the best&#xD;
      vehicle to increase the bioavailability of CoQ10 with the lowest side effects for the&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Benefits and importance of CoQ10 for the human health:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) is an endogenously produced lipid-soluble molecule of the human organism&#xD;
      that is considered an essential component of the mitochondrial electron transport chain where&#xD;
      it is the electron acceptor for complexes I and II. In this context, CoQ10 plays a key role&#xD;
      in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and ATP production and therefore it is essential&#xD;
      for all energy-dependent processes in the body, enhancing the immune-system and acting as a&#xD;
      free radical scavenger. In addition to its abundant presence in the mitochondrion, CoQ10 is&#xD;
      found in other organelles such as endoplasmic reticulum, peroxisomes, lysosomes and vesicles.&#xD;
      It is a membrane stabilizer, preserves myocardial sodium-potassium ATPase activity, and&#xD;
      stabilizes myocardial calcium-dependent ion channels. Several factors such as ageing, poor&#xD;
      eating habits, stress and infection, are known to affect the organism's ability to continue&#xD;
      synthesizing and providing the adequate amounts of CoQ10. With age, the human organism begins&#xD;
      to develop a CoQ10 deficiency due to its inability to synthesize it from food where it is&#xD;
      present in beef, poultry, broccoli, soya oil and peanuts. In this context, several&#xD;
      researchers have advised using CoQ10 supplements alone or in combination with other&#xD;
      nutritional supplements to alleviate this deficiency and help maintain health of elderly&#xD;
      people or treat some of the health problems or diseases. Due to these functions, CoQ10 finds&#xD;
      its application in different commercial branches such as food, cosmetic, or pharmaceutical&#xD;
      industries. The antioxidant activity of CoQ10 surpasses both in the amount and in efficiency&#xD;
      other antioxidants. The protective effect is extended to lipids proteins and DNA mainly&#xD;
      because of its close localization to the oxidative events and the effective regeneration by&#xD;
      continuous reduction at all locations. CoQ10 in its reduced form as a hydroquinone&#xD;
      (ubiquinol) is a potent lipophilic antioxidant that has a great importance as a free radical&#xD;
      scavenger. CoQ10 protects the stability of the cell membranes, protects DNA from free radical&#xD;
      induced oxidative damage, and is capable of recycling and regenerating other antioxidants,&#xD;
      such as tocopherol and ascorbate. Other important functions of CoQ10 as e.g. cell signaling&#xD;
      and gene expression have also been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Absorption and Transport of CoQ10:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Taking its lipophilic nature, the absorption of CoQ10 is enhanced in the presence of lipids&#xD;
      with the main role attributed to the intestinal secretions from the pancreas and bile that&#xD;
      are known to facilitate emulsification and micelle formation required for the fats&#xD;
      absorption. Either during or following its absorption in the intestine, CoQ10 is reduced to&#xD;
      ubiquinol, incorporated into chylomicrons and then transported via the lymphatics to the&#xD;
      circulation where about 95% of CoQ10 in circulation exists in its reduced form as ubiquinol&#xD;
      in human subjects. Plasma CoQ10 concentrations are highly dependent on plasma lipoproteins&#xD;
      where CoQ10 redistributes possibly to protect lipoproteins from oxidation. Several factors&#xD;
      have highlighted the poor absorption of orally administered CoQ10 such as its insolubility in&#xD;
      water, limited solubility in lipids, and relatively large molecular weight. A preclinical&#xD;
      study has reported that only about 2-3% of orally-administered CoQ10 was absorbed.&#xD;
      Additionally, the absorption of CoQ10 and its bioavailability have been shown to be dependent&#xD;
      on other factors such as the nature of the formulation of CoQ10 with solubilized formulations&#xD;
      been reported to have an advanced effect on the bioavailability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tissue distribution of CoQ10 in humans and animals:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon its presence in the circulatory system, CoQ10 is distributed in all the tissues in&#xD;
      varying amounts with high concentrations been reported to be present in organs with high&#xD;
      metabolic activities such as the heart, kidney, liver and muscle. Additionally, and due to&#xD;
      its lipophilic nature, the lipid content of the body organ do play a role in the CoQ10&#xD;
      distribution. At the subcellular level, data have shown that a large portion of CoQ10&#xD;
      (40-50%) is localized in the mitochondrial inner membrane, with smaller amounts in the other&#xD;
      organelles and in the cytosol. At the blood level, about 95% of CoQ10 is present in the&#xD;
      ubiquinol-reduced form. Among blood cells, lymphocytes and platelets contain significant&#xD;
      amounts of CoQ10 whereas red blood cells contain only a tiny amount due to their lack of&#xD;
      mitochondria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pharmacokinetics of CoQ10:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a pharmacokinetic study conducted on sixteen healthy subjects, and using deuterium-labeled&#xD;
      CoQ10 (100 mg), a Tmax of 6.5 h along with an elimination half-life of about 33 hours and a&#xD;
      mean plasma levels around 1 µg/ml have been reported. Similar results have been also found&#xD;
      when unlabeled CoQ10 has been used in another study. It is worth to mention that powder-based&#xD;
      CoQ10 products were used in both of these studies. To compare the bioavailability of several&#xD;
      CoQ10 formulations, three different solubilized formulations of CoQ10 were compared to a&#xD;
      powder-based formulation. Results have shown that two of the solubilized formulations along&#xD;
      with the powder product have showed a Tmax of about 6 h whereas the remaining solubilized&#xD;
      formulation had a Tmax of about 8 h. These results were similar and in accordance to other&#xD;
      results. The Tmax value of about 6 h or longer indicates that CoQ10 is absorbed slowly from&#xD;
      the gastrointestinal tract and this is attributable to both its hydrophobicity and high&#xD;
      molecular weight. In the different pharmacokinetic studies conducted on CoQ10, a second&#xD;
      plasma CoQ10 peak has been observed at about 24 h following oral ingestion, which may be due&#xD;
      to both enterohepatic recycling and redistribution from the liver to circulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bioavailability of CoQ10 / Delivery systems:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although CoQ10 has been reported to be useful for the treatment of several diseases such as&#xD;
      ageing, fatigue, irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, and immune system impairment among&#xD;
      others, its efficacy has been always hindered by its high lipophilicity and poor solubility&#xD;
      in water, which leads to decreased absorption into the systemic circulation. Several&#xD;
      conventional formulations of CoQ10 are available in the form of soft gel capsules, oral spray&#xD;
      and tablets. Despite these, the idea of delivery of CoQ10 to the body remains a challenge. To&#xD;
      overcome the slow absorption of CoQ10, various bioavailability enhancement methods have been&#xD;
      developed such as liposomes, polymeric nanoparticles, polymeric micelles, solid lipid&#xD;
      nanoparticles, nanostructured lipid carriers, self-emulsifying systems, nanoemulsions and&#xD;
      solid and aqueous dispersions have been explored and developed to improve the solubility, the&#xD;
      absorption and the bioavailability of CoQ106. Based on purified phospholipids as the key&#xD;
      component and with a dose of 100 mg of CoQ10, NanoSolve has shown to increase the&#xD;
      bioavailability of CoQ10 fivefold in comparison to pure CoQ109. Using cyclodextrin as a&#xD;
      carrier, a novel patented formulation known as Q10Vital® has demonstrated its ability to&#xD;
      increase the bioavailability of CoQ10 when two Q10Vital formulations (liquid and powder) were&#xD;
      compared to regular CoQ10/soybean oil softgels. Although no difference in the Tmax was&#xD;
      observed between the three tested products, both Q10Vital formulations have reported a higher&#xD;
      Δcmax (32 % for the liquid formulation and 25% for the powder formulation) in comparison with&#xD;
      the regular softgel product.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although several technologies and delivery systems have been used to improve the absorption&#xD;
      of CoQ10 and increase its bioavailability, the carriers used to deliver CoQ10 are based on&#xD;
      synthetic products with no health benefits attributed to them. In alignment with its mission&#xD;
      and vision to deliver wellness products, Biodroga Neutraceuticals Inc has decided to develop&#xD;
      a new product (MaxSiQ10) aiming to increase the absorption and the bioavailability of CoQ10&#xD;
      by using omega-3 fatty acids as a vector delivery system and a carrier for CoQ10. The&#xD;
      benefits of omega-3 fatty acids to the human health have been well documented and reported in&#xD;
      several studies20-22. Because the human body does not efficiently produce fish-derived&#xD;
      omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) from its precursor alpha-linolenic acid, it is necessary to&#xD;
      obtain adequate amounts through fish and fish-oil products. Studies have shown that EPA and&#xD;
      DHA have been associated with better fetal development, including neuronal, retinal, and&#xD;
      immune function. Additionally, EPA and DHA may affect many aspects of cardiovascular function&#xD;
      including inflammation, peripheral artery disease, major coronary events, and&#xD;
      anticoagulation. Promising results have been attributed for EPA and DHA in weight management,&#xD;
      and prevention of cognitive decline. To differentiate themselves from the other products and&#xD;
      technologies already existing on the market, Biodroga Neutraceuticals Inc will be using its&#xD;
      MaxSimil® technology as the vector delivery system for CoQ10. MaxSimil is a new-patented&#xD;
      delivery technology that intrinsically enhances the absorption of omega-3 fatty acids (EPA&#xD;
      and DHA) of a given fish oil by modifying its glyceride composition to simulate digestion.&#xD;
      This technology delivers &quot;absorption-ready&quot; formulations enriched with &quot;self emulsifing&quot;&#xD;
      monoglycerides (MAG) and have the potential to be better absorbed when compared to the more&#xD;
      traditional ethyl ester (EE) and reconstituted triglycerides (rTG) fish oil forms available&#xD;
      on the market today. What differentiates MaxSimil relies in being a completely natural health&#xD;
      product with a demonstrated ability to increase the absorption of omega-3 fatty acids whereas&#xD;
      other carriers are synthetic chemical surfactants with detrimental effects on human cells.&#xD;
      Therefore, this project will test a MAG-Omega-3 formulation enriched with CoQ10, since it was&#xD;
      hypothesized that this formulation will be the most absorbed and bioavailable with the lowest&#xD;
      side effects in men and women without any disease such as intestinal lipid absorption issues.&#xD;
