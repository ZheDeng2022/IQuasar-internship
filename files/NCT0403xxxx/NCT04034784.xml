  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will assess the safety and tolerability of a new liquid anti-adhesion device,&#xD;
      Discrete(TM), in healthy volunteers, in order to determine the best volume of Discrete(TM) to&#xD;
      go forward into clinical efficacy research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical trial will progress in accordance with first-in-human study guidance from the&#xD;
      United States Food and Drug Administration (US FDA) and European Medicines Agency (EMA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      It will be conducted as a randomized, controlled, double-blinded, single ascending volume,&#xD;
      single-center, interventional safety trial. Participants will remain blinded to treatment&#xD;
      until end of clinical trial. A maximum of 7 cohorts will be studied to assess maximum&#xD;
      tolerated volume of investigational medical device compared with Control Lactated Ringer's&#xD;
      solution (LRS) administered intraperitoneally. The trial will commence with a low volume and&#xD;
      progress in a sequential, stepwise volume-escalating schema until defined maximum tolerated&#xD;
      volume criteria are met. Following determination of the maximum tolerated volume, it is&#xD;
      anticipated that up to 2 additional cohorts will be enrolled, wherein all participants will&#xD;
      also receive a single standard dose of a commonly used anticoagulant as used in surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of 81 participants will be enrolled. Eligible and consented adult men and women&#xD;
      will be sequentially enrolled within each cohort at a ratio of 6 participants on Discrete(TM)&#xD;
      to 3 participants on Control LRS. Participants will be followed for up to 10 days after&#xD;
      intraperitoneal application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An independent Data and Safety Monitoring Committee will closely review safety in the&#xD;
      clinical trial.&#xD;
