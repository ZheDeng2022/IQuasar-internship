    <textblock>
      This single arm study will evaluate whether Xermelo (telotristat ethyl) associated weight&#xD;
      gain is affects lean body mass, dietary intake, and physical and cognitive functioning among&#xD;
      neuroendocrine tumor (NET) patients with a history of carcinoid syndrome.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the mechanisms of weight gain associated with the&#xD;
      drug telotristat ethyl (Xermelo) among patients with a neuroendocrine tumor (NET) with&#xD;
      history of carcinoid syndrome. We want to know if taking Xermelo affects patients' lean body&#xD;
      mass, quality of life, dietary intake, and physical and cognitive functioning during&#xD;
      treatment. A better understanding of the mechanisms of weight gain from Xermelo may allow us&#xD;
      to determine whether this drug may be beneficial for treating carcinoid syndrome, cachexia,&#xD;
      or weight loss seen in other diseases.&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in lean body mass (measured using DXA Scan) from baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment.</measure>

  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in patient reported outcomes using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30) from baseline up to 3 years post treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>The summary score (SS) is a mean of 13 QLQ-C30 subscale scores, ranging from 0 to 100, with a higher SS rating reflecting a better health status.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in patient reported outcomes using the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MOCA) test from baseline up to 3 years post treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 3 years post treatment</time_frame>
    <description>MOCA scores range between 0 and 30, with higher scores indicating higher cognitive function.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Mean change in patient reported outcomes using a stool survey measured from baseline and after 13 weeks of treatment.</measure>
    <time_frame>From baseline to 13 weeks post-treatment.</time_frame>
    <description>The stool survey is a non-validated descriptive measure of gastrointestinal symptoms by taking the mean score on a scale of 0 - 10, where 0 indicates no symptoms and higher scores denote a worsening of symptoms.</description>
