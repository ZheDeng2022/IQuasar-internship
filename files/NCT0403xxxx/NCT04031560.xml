  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bipolar disorder is related to a high level of personal, familial, social and economic&#xD;
      burden. There is a need for feasible adjunctive psychological interventions to use in&#xD;
      clinical practice as a complement of pharmacotherapy to enhance aspects that medication&#xD;
      cannot reach. This project aims at develop and evaluate the impact of an adjunctive brief&#xD;
      integrative program for bipolar patients (euthymic or with subthreshold symptoms). The&#xD;
      patients (N=124) will be randomly assigned to two different groups. The experimental group&#xD;
      (62 patients) will take part on a group integrative program consisting of 12-sessions of 90&#xD;
      minutes (based on psychoeducation, mindfulness and functional remediation) whilst the control&#xD;
      group (62 patients) will not receive any sort of add-on psychotherapy. All patients will&#xD;
      mantain standard psychiatric treatment. Together with the baseline assessment, the whole&#xD;
      sample will be assessed after the intervention and at 12 months from the baseline evaluation,&#xD;
      regarding sociodemographic, clinical and neuropsychological variables. If the intervention is&#xD;
      effective it will improve psychosocial functioning (main variable), wellbeing and quality of&#xD;
      life, as well as improve clinical outcomes and neurocognitive functioning of those affected&#xD;
      by the illness.&#xD;

      Study design: Single-blind randomized control trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Study participants will be enrolled from the Bipolar Disorders Program of the&#xD;
      Hospital Clinic of Barcelona (Spain) and the Bipolar Disorders Unit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: At baseline, the sample will be evaluated with respect to sociodemographic,&#xD;
      clinical and neuropsychological variables. Subsequently, patients will be randomly assigned&#xD;
      (1:1) to two different groups. The experimental group (62 patients) will take part on the&#xD;
      integrative group program consisting of 12-sessions, 90 minutes each, once a week (4 focused&#xD;
      on psychoeducation, 1 directed to the family relatives, 3 on mindfulness and 4 on functional&#xD;
      remediation) whilst the control group (62 patients) will not receive any type of add-on&#xD;
      psychotherapy. All the patients will maintain a standard psychiatric treatment during the&#xD;
      study. Together with the baseline assessment, the whole sample will be assessed after the&#xD;
      intervention and at the 12 months of follow-up. Psychiatric medication will be recorded&#xD;
      during the follow-up and the reasons for eventual modifications. All the subjects will be&#xD;
      evaluated by researchers blinded to the treatment condition. Semi-structured interviews will&#xD;
      be conducted and complemented with clinical records and with assessment instruments to&#xD;
      collect variables related to the course of the illness. This study will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the ethical principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and Good Clinical&#xD;
      Practice and approved by the Hospital Clinic Ethics and Research. All participants will be&#xD;
      asked to provide written informed consent prior to their inclusion in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Variables assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demographic variables: gender, age, marital status, educational status and work&#xD;
           situation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Clinical variables: age at the onset of BD, age at first hospitalization, total number&#xD;
           and type of previous episodes, hospitalizations, history of psychotic symptoms, polarity&#xD;
           of the first episode, seasonal pattern, presence of rapid cycling, bipolar subtype (I or&#xD;
           II), comorbidities, familial psychiatric history, familial history of affective&#xD;
           disorder, familial history of complete suicide, previous suicide attempts, number of&#xD;
           attempts, method and medical severity of attempts, history of drug use.&#xD;
&#xD;

           (BRIAN, Rosa et al., 2007), and Cognitive Complaints in Bipolar Disorder Rating&#xD;
           Assessment (COBRA, Rosa et al., 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Psychosocial functioning: Functional assessment short test (FAST, Rosa et al., 2007).&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Wellbeing and quality of life: WHO (Five) Well Being Index (WHO, 1998), Quality of Life&#xD;

    <description>The scale is interviewer-administered, designed for the assessment of psychosocial functioning. The 24 items of the scale are divided among 6 specific areas of functioning: autonomy, occupational functioning, cognitive functioning, financial issues, interpersonal relationships and leisure time. Each individual item is scored from 0 to 3. The global score (0-72) is obtained when the scores of each item are added up. The higher the score, the more serious the difficulties.</description>
