  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      By capturing possible or known risk factors, it will be possible to recognize connections&#xD;
      between these risk factors and the disease, thus obtaining valuable insights into the cause&#xD;
      of the disease. This in turn facilitates an improved evaluation of the treatment situation as&#xD;
      well as influencing future framework conditions for preventive measures and planning&#xD;
      treatments. Disease registries are thus crucial for the planning and structuring of health&#xD;
      policies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present registry protocol serves as a basis for the proper implementation of a registry&#xD;
      for patients with chronic inflammatory bowel diseases. It describes the study rationale,&#xD;
      objectives, design, participant groups, procedures and evaluation methods. Furthermore, it&#xD;
      defines the responsibilities of each person involved in maintaining the registry and also&#xD;
      forms the basis for decisions regarding evaluation by the Ethics Committee.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In view of the high prevalence and currently unsatisfactory treatment status, there is a&#xD;
      significant medical demand for more effective treatment options. These require greater&#xD;
      knowledge about the condition in the form of full disease progressions while exposed to a&#xD;
      wide range of different treatment concepts and influencing factors. It has been possible to&#xD;
      significantly increase scientific understanding of the pathogenesis of ulcerative colitis and&#xD;
      Crohn's disease over the last few decades. Clinical and experimental results indicate a&#xD;
      causal link with gastrointestinal barrier dysfunction and defective regulation of the immune&#xD;
      system. However, no evidence has been found to prove that patients with the disease develop&#xD;
      an immune deficiency by themselves, resulting in an increased susceptibility to bacterial or&#xD;
      viral infections. Furthermore, there are unanswered questions concerning aetiology, risk&#xD;
      factors and influencing factors for the early prediction of treatment responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this registry is to expand on previous findings in the field of diagnostic and&#xD;
      therapeutic pathways for patients with Crohn's disease, ulcerative colitis and indeterminate&#xD;
      colitis undergoing routine administration of a targeted therapy (biologics or another&#xD;
      targeted therapy such as Janus kinase therapy) and various different treatment approaches. A&#xD;
      data pool is to be generated for this purpose, in order to&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  analyse disease progression&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  systematize findings about treatment processes&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify potential influencing factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  review any new diagnostic procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  identify potential test subjects for further study&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  evaluate the safety of various treatment concepts&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific objective has not been defined for this registry as a registry does not per se&#xD;
      need to build upon the foundation of a theoretically-deduced research hypothesis. Rather, it&#xD;
      acts as a gateway for generating a systematic data repository.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The registry offers researchers the opportunity to formulate their own research hypotheses&#xD;
      based on the collected data and to then use the generated data pool to attempt to test their&#xD;
      hypothesis. Additional data/variables could also be collected as necessary in order to answer&#xD;
      certain questions.&#xD;
