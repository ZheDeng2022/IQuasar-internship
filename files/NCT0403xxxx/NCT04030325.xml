  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study evaluates the relative merit of a multi-component PFI presented in the traditional&#xD;
      simultaneous delivery (i.e., all components at once) versus a sequential format, wherein&#xD;
      individual PFI components are delivered one at a time over several weeks to minimize time and&#xD;
      attention demands for each component.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study builds upon the latest alcohol intervention literature to develop and test the&#xD;
      next wave of personalized feedback interventions (PFIs) to address harmful alcohol use among&#xD;
      college students. The purpose of this research is to determine optimal configuration of PFIs&#xD;
      to take advantage of the clarity and initial impact of single-component PFIs and greater&#xD;
      effect size and duration of personalized multi-component PFIs. The Investigators seek to&#xD;
      increase and evaluate engagement with the PFI and text-message materials and boost innovation&#xD;
      of both content and process of the intervention. In addition to PFI content and delivery, the&#xD;
      investigators will use qualitative and quantitative methods to determine personal relevance&#xD;
      of the chosen high-risk events among a sample of students who engage in heavy episodic&#xD;
      drinking to better understand duration of PFI effects impacted by fluctuations in drinking&#xD;
      associated with high-risk events. Prior interventions have targeted drinking in general or a&#xD;
      single high-risk drinking event (e.g., Spring Break), but have not targeted both general and&#xD;
      event-specific drinking together. These enhanced intervention effects, could have a&#xD;
      significant impact on risks associated with college student drinking, and can be rapidly&#xD;
      disseminated and implemented on campuses nationwide to address the public health problem&#xD;
      posed by heavy episodic drinking among college students.&#xD;

    <time_frame>6 months of assessment</time_frame>
    <description>The first primary outcome of this program of research is to assess change in alcohol use from baseline to 6 months utilizing the Daily Drinking Questionnaire. The Daily Drinking Questionnaire assesses typical number of drinks on each of day of a typical week in the past month.&#xD;
Participants are allowed to enter the number of drinks for each day of the week. Values for each day will be summed together to create a composite score of typical weekly drinking. Minimum value is zero (0) and there is no maximum for the scale. Data will be assessed for outliers.</description>
