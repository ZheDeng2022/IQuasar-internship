  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The reason for the study is to find out if an experimental combination of an oral medication&#xD;
      called osimertinib (TAGRISSO®) when used in combination with chemotherapy is more effective&#xD;
      than giving osimertinib alone for the treatment of locally advanced or metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer. Some lung cancers are due to mutations in the Deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)&#xD;
      which, if known, can help physicians decide the best treatment for their patients. One type&#xD;
      of mutation can occur in the gene that produces a protein on the surface of cells called the&#xD;
      Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Osimertinib is an Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)&#xD;
      that targets Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutations. Unfortunately, despite the&#xD;
      benefit observed for patients treated with osimertinib, the vast majority of cancers are&#xD;
      expected to develop resistance to the drug over time. The exact reasons why resistance&#xD;
      develops are not fully understood but based upon clinical research it is hoped that combining&#xD;
      osimertinib with another type of anti-cancer therapy known as chemotherapy will delay the&#xD;
      onset of resistance and the worsening of a patient's cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In total the study aims to enroll approximately 586 patients, consisting of approximately 30&#xD;
      patients who will participate in a safety run-in component of the trial, and approximately&#xD;
      556 who will receive osimertinib alone or osimertinib in combination with chemotherapy in the&#xD;
      main trial. In the main part of the trial there is a one in two chance of receiving&#xD;
      osimertinib alone, and the treatment is decided at random by a computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study involves a Screening Period, Treatment Period, and Follow up Period. Whilst&#xD;
      receiving study medication, it is expected patients will attend, on average, approximately 15&#xD;
      visits over the first 12 months and then approximately 4 visits per year afterwards. Each&#xD;
      visit will last about 2 to 6 hours depending on the arrangement of medical assessments by the&#xD;
      study centre.&#xD;
