  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was a Phase 3, multicenter, randomized, controlled, double-masked (including subjects,&#xD;
      Investigators, study site personnel, and Sponsor personnel) study designed to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray 0.6 mg/mL and 1.2 mg/mL in adult&#xD;
      participants with DED. The study randomized 758 subjects at least 22 years of age with a&#xD;
      physicians' diagnosis of DED and meeting all other study eligibility criteria to receive&#xD;
      OC-01 (varenicline) nasal spray or placebo twice daily (BID) for 28 days with three&#xD;
      additional long-term follow-up visits at 6 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Participants who&#xD;
      terminated from the study during the treatment period were asked to complete safety&#xD;
      assessments (if the participants agree) prior to study exit. Participants who were terminated&#xD;
      early from the study were not replaced&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have used and/or desired to use an artificial tear substitute for dry eye symptoms&#xD;
             within 6 months prior to Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have had any intraocular surgery (such as cataract surgery), extraocular surgery (such&#xD;
             as blepharoplasty) in either eye within three months or refractive surgery (e.g.&#xD;
             laser-assisted in-situ keratomileusis, laser epithelial keratomileusis,&#xD;
             photorefractive keratectomy or corneal implant) within twelve months of Visit 1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a history or presence of any ocular disorder or condition in either eye that&#xD;
             would, in the opinion of the Investigator, likely interfere with the interpretation of&#xD;
             the study results or participant safety such as significant corneal or conjunctival&#xD;
             scarring; pterygium or nodular pinguecula; current ocular infection, conjunctivitis,&#xD;
             or inflammation not associated with dry eye; anterior (epithelial) basement membrane&#xD;
             corneal dystrophy or other clinically significant corneal dystrophy or degeneration;&#xD;
             ocular herpetic infection; evidence of keratoconus; etc. Blepharitis not requiring&#xD;
             treatment and mild meibomian gland disease that are typically associated with DED are&#xD;
             allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a systemic condition or disease not stabilized or judged by the Investigator to&#xD;
             be incompatible with participation in the study or with the lengthier assessments&#xD;
             required by the study (e.g., current systemic infection, uncontrolled autoimmune&#xD;
             disease, uncontrolled immunodeficiency disease, history of myocardial infarction or&#xD;
             heart disease, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have a known hypersensitivity to any of the procedural agents or study drug components&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have any condition or history that, in the opinion of the investigator, may interfere&#xD;
             with study compliance, outcome measures, safety parameters, and/or the general medical&#xD;
             condition of the subject&#xD;
