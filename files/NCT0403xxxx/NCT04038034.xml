  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a randomized, double blind study with competitive enrolment, aimed to enroll a total&#xD;
      of 70 patients with a diagnosis of primary open angle glaucoma (POAG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients, after signing the Informed Consent, will enter into a 1- week screening phase&#xD;
      during which the baseline tests will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be randomized in a 1:1 ratio to the following groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group A of 35 patients treated with pressure lowering drugs and placebo;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  group B of 35 patients with pressure lowering drugs and COQUN oral formulation 100 mg&#xD;
           BID.&#xD;

             time prior the initiation of the stable treatment with anti-hypertensive topical&#xD;
             drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients affected by POAG and under stable treatment with anti-hypertensive topical&#xD;
