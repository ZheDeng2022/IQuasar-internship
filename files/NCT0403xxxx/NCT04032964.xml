      Open-label, phase 1 dose confirmation study in patients with advanced, unresectable and/or&#xD;
      metastatic soft tissue sarcoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six (6) Patients will be enrolled sequentially and will be treated according to the following&#xD;
      scheme:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Doxorubicin 75 mg/m2 i.v. on day 1 of each 21-day cycle L19TNF 13 µg/kg i.v. on day 1,3 and&#xD;
      5 of each 21-day cycle Initiation of the study treatment for an individual subject will occur&#xD;
      no less than 3 days after initiation of the study treatment for the previous patient. Not&#xD;
      more than 2 patients are to be treated simultaneously in Cycle 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should unacceptable toxicities occur in ≥ 2 patients during the observation period from Day 1&#xD;
      to Day 21 (first cycle), enrollment will be stopped.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If a patient is not evaluable for unacceptable toxicity, he/she will be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be treated in repeated cycles until the treatment or when one of the following&#xD;
      criteria are met:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unacceptable toxicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease Progression or relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient or the investigator requests the treatment discontinuation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The patient meets a withdrawal criterion. Patients with SD or PR (according to Response&#xD;
           Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) v.1.1 evaluation) after the maximum of 6&#xD;
           cycles of study treatment, will receive maintenance therapy for up to 18 maintenance&#xD;
           cycles from start of treatment, toxicity or until disease progression occurs.&#xD;
           Maintenance can start immediately after the end of cycle 6 and consists infusions of&#xD;
           L19TNF on Day 1 of each maintenance cycle (every 3 weeks) and doxorubicin on Day 1 of&#xD;
           maintenance cycle 1 and 2 (if appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to evaluate the safety of L19TNF in combination with doxorubicin and&#xD;
      to establish a recommended dose (RD), assessed as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Adverse events (AEs), serious adverse events (SAE) and drug induced liver injury (DILI)&#xD;
           assessment based on Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v.5.0&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Standard laboratory (hematology, biochemistry and urinalysis) parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Electrocardiogram (ECG) and echocardiogram (ECHO) findings. In particular, data about&#xD;
           QT/QTc intervals will be collected and analyzed for QT/QTc prolongation potentially&#xD;
           caused by treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical examination findings including assessment of vital signs and physical&#xD;
           measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of the study is to evaluate signs of efficacy measured as&#xD;
      progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 3, 6, 9, 12 and 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other secondary objectives of the study are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Efficacy of L19TNF in combination with doxorubicin:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Overall response rate (ORR, consisting of CR and PR).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Disease Control Rate (DCR, i.e. complete response (CR), partial response (PR) and stable&#xD;
           disease (SD))&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of the formation of human anti-fusion protein antibodies (HAFA) against&#xD;
           L19TNF.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Characterization of pharmacokinetics (PK) of L19TNF and doxorubicin&#xD;

             follow-up imaging, have been asymptomatic for at least 60 days and are not receiving&#xD;
             systemic corticosteroids and or/anticonvulsants, are eligible. Participants with signs&#xD;

&#xD;
         11. History within the last year of cerebrovascular disease and/or acute or subacute&#xD;
