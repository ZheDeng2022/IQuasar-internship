  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The majority of endometrial cancer patients with disease spread beyond the uterus will&#xD;
      progress within 1 year. Platinum-based chemotherapy was used as the first-line treatment in&#xD;
      metastatic or advanced endometrial cancer. There is no standard protocol for the second-line&#xD;
      option when tumors persist or recur. In vitro and in vivo studies showed Crizotinib, an&#xD;
      approved drug for the treatment of ALK-positive non-small cell lung cancer, demonstrated&#xD;
      activities in endometrial cancer with c-MET kinase and Sema domain mutations. As a&#xD;
      consequence, a phase 2 clinical trial to investigate the efficacy of Crizotinib in&#xD;
      endometrial cancer patients with MET mutation is initiated.&#xD;

      In this phase 2 study, the target population is patients with recurrent or persistent&#xD;
      metastatic endometrial cancer. The mutation status of c-MET gene will be tested and only&#xD;
      patients with c-MET mutation will be enrolled. After enrollment, Crizotinib 250 mg bid will&#xD;
      be used orally. CT scan or MRI will be used to determine the response. Crizotinib will be&#xD;
      continued till disease progression. Primary end is objective response rate. The secondary&#xD;
      endpoints include progression-free survival, overall survival and safety profiles.&#xD;
