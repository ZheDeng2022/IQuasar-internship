  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of the study is to evaluate if daily feedback on food-derived metabolites in&#xD;
      stool enhances an individual's ability to make and/or sustain a dietary change.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out how people respond to information about food-derived&#xD;
      compounds measured in their stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will take place over a three-week period. For these three weeks, participants in a&#xD;
      medical weight loss program will be asked to collect samples of their stool daily from Monday&#xD;
      to Friday, with optional sampling on weekends. We will measure the amount of butyrate, a&#xD;
      breakdown product of fiber, in each sample provided and return this measurement by text&#xD;
      message. Participants will be randomized into two groups: one group will have new&#xD;
      measurements returned the day after providing each stool sample, and another will have their&#xD;
      measurements returned all at once, at the end of the study. Both groups will also receive a&#xD;
      daily text message report of their fiber intake, based on the foods they ordered at the&#xD;
      weight loss facility cafeteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The greatest risks of the study include the possibility of infection while sampling stool,&#xD;
      possible gastrointestinal discomfort from changes to the diet, and potential loss of&#xD;
      confidentiality.&#xD;
