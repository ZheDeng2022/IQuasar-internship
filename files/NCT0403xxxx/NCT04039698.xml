  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a non-randomized, single group clinical trial on monitoring hepatitis C therapy&#xD;
      using telemedicine. Patients with chronic hepatitis C without cirrhosis will be treated with&#xD;
      the pangenotypic regimen of direct acting antivirals sofosbuvir and velpatasvir for 12 weeks&#xD;
      after a single visit to the clinic, in which treatment will be prescribed. Patients will be&#xD;
      then monitored by telemedicine tools, like instant message application, telephone and video&#xD;
      calls and by his or her primary physician when needed. Twelve weeks after treatment&#xD;
      conclusion, hepatitis C virus RNA levels will be measured on a blood sample, indicating the&#xD;
      cure rate and efficacy of this protocol on HCV treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of the study is to address the feasibility and applicability of the&#xD;
      usage of telemedicine tools to increase access and monitor HCV treatment with direct-acting&#xD;
      antivirals in public health in Brazil.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Scientific rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      It's estimated that 0.7% of the Brazilian population is infected with hepatitis C virus&#xD;
      (HCV). In March 2018, the Ministry of Health defined all patients with HCV to be able to&#xD;
      receive direct-acting antivirals (DAAs) from the public health system without any charges.&#xD;
      Though this &quot;universal-access policy&quot;, frequently there are still many obstacles for patients&#xD;
      to actually get at the treatment: patients living in cities distant from big centres and&#xD;
      underserved by specialized physicians in the country, lack of medical doctors experienced in&#xD;
      HCV treatment in the public system, delay between prescription and starting of medications&#xD;
      because of administrative issues, and socioeconomic vulnerability among people.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Telemedicine tools are powerful ways of reaching people living distant from big centres, and&#xD;
      there are some successful international experiences with hepatitis C treatment in this field,&#xD;
      like Project ECHO® (Extension for Community Healthcare Outcomes). In Brazil, there is a&#xD;
      national program, geographically located in Porto Alegre, that uses telemedicine to improve&#xD;
      healthcare quality in primary care by offering continuous education and teleconsultations (by&#xD;
      text or toll-free hotline) to community physicians and other healthcare professionals working&#xD;
      in public primary care institutions all over the country.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address the applicability of telemedicine tools to increase access and monitor HCV&#xD;
      treatment with direct-acting antivirals in public health in Brazil.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research methods&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV-infected patients in the waiting list for specialized consultation with&#xD;
      gastroenterologist or infectious disease physician will be recruited to a meeting that will&#xD;
      consist of a HCV lecture followed by individual, focused consultation with medical history,&#xD;
      analysis of previous lab results (including fibrosis evaluation by the AST-to-platelets ratio&#xD;
      index - APRI) and collection of blood samples. All patients will receive a prescription of&#xD;
      pan-genotypic DAA sofosbuvir and velpatasvir regimen for 12 weeks according to the Brazilian&#xD;
      Ministry of Health's Treatment Protocol, along with orientations about use and potential side&#xD;
      effects and ways to contact the telemedicine centre - mobile phone instant messages and&#xD;
      WhatsApp® messages, phone calls and video calls. Issues regarding the administrative process&#xD;
      will be held by the study team and medications will be delivered to each patient's city or&#xD;
      region at the time they're available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before starting treatment, patients will be oriented about treatment administration, its&#xD;
      potential side effects and ways of contacting the research team by text messages, phone calls&#xD;
      and, when appropriate, teleconsultation by video teleconference with the patient and one of&#xD;
      the healthcare professionals of the study. During the treatment course, adverse effects will&#xD;
      be monitored and, when present, graded by the Division of AIDS (DAIDS) Table from the&#xD;
      National Institutes of Health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The family physicians working in each patient area will be oriented about this study and HCV&#xD;
      treatment. Moreover, they will be invited to join the regular Project ECHO® meetings held by&#xD;
      the Brazilian centre located at Porto Alegre. Healthcare professionals also have the&#xD;
      toll-free hotline to get in touch with the telemedicine program and investigators. HCV-RNA&#xD;
      will be collected 12 weeks after the end of therapy at a local institution next to patient&#xD;
      home or city.&#xD;
