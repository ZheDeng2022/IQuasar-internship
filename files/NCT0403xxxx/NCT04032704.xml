  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial will study ladiratuzumab vedotin (LV) to find out if it works to treat different&#xD;
      types of solid tumors. It will also find out what side effects may occur. A side effect is&#xD;
      anything the drug does besides treating cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This trial is designed to assess the antitumor activity, safety, and tolerability of LV for&#xD;
      the treatment of solid tumors. Participants with the following advanced solid tumors will be&#xD;
      enrolled:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cohort 1: small cell lung cancer (SCLC) Cohort 2: non-small cell lung cancer-squamous&#xD;
      (NSCLC-squamous) Cohort 3: non-small cell lung cancer-nonsquamous (NSCLC-nonsquamous) Cohort&#xD;
      4: head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) Cohort 5: esophageal squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
      (esophageal-squamous) Cohort 6: gastric and gastroesophageal junction (GEJ) adenocarcinoma&#xD;
      Cohort 7: castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) Cohort 8: melanoma&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will continue to receive study treatment until disease progression, unacceptable&#xD;
      toxicity, investigator decision, consent withdrawal, study termination by the sponsor,&#xD;
      pregnancy, or death, whichever comes first.&#xD;
