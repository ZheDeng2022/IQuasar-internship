  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this study, liver samples will be collected, processed and stored in a specialized,&#xD;
      clinical grade, cell bank for potential future clinical use. A set of ex-vivo immunogenicity&#xD;
      and transdiffrentiation tests will be carried to confirm the ability of this cryopreserved&#xD;
      cell batch to be used as clinical grade raw material. Biopsies will be collected during TP or&#xD;
      PP with the assumption that some of the patients (especially PP patients will not go through&#xD;
      Islets autotransplantation) will develop brittle diabetes, thus Orgenesis therapy can provide&#xD;
      them in the long run, a treatment. In terms of T1DM the purpose is to have available clinical&#xD;
      grade raw material for cell replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected liver samples will be proliferated (up to passage 4) for future use. A portion&#xD;
      of the stored cells will be utilized in a small-scale process to test possible immunogenicity&#xD;
      performed on the collected blood sample. The assay will provide data whether immunomodulation&#xD;
      treatment will be required in the future clinical trials. Also the transdffrentiated cells&#xD;
      (AIPs) will be tested according to release criteria relevant for clinical IPC production.&#xD;
      Liver biopsy donors will be contacted upon approval of the consecutive study and will have&#xD;
      study recruitment priority. The donors can refuse to participate in the future study or may&#xD;
      not need the therapy, however, their biopsies will be stored for a potential use if required,&#xD;
      after the therapy is approved.&#xD;
