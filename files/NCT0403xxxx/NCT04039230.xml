      This research is studying the effect of Antibody-Drug Conjugate Sacituzumab Govitecan in&#xD;
      Combination with the Poly (Adenosine Diphosphate [ADP]-Ribose) Polymerase (PARP) Inhibitor&#xD;
      Talazoparib in Patients with Metastatic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Phase I/II clinical trial. You are being asked to participate in the Phase I&#xD;
      portion of the study. A Phase I clinical trial tests the safety of an investigational drug&#xD;
      and also tries to define the appropriate dose of the investigational drug to use for further&#xD;
      studies. &quot;Investigational&quot; means that the drug is being studied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved sacituzumab govitecan as a&#xD;
      treatment for any disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The FDA has not approved talazoparib for this specific disease, but it has been approved for&#xD;
      other uses in breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sacituzumab govitecan is an antibody-drug conjugate which means it's made up of an antibody&#xD;
      attached to an anticancer drug. An antibody is a protein normally made by the immune system&#xD;
      (the system in the body that fights off diseases). Sacituzumab govitecan is believed to work&#xD;
      by binding the antibody portion of the drug to the tumor(s) while the anticancer drug portion&#xD;
      works to prevent the cancer cells from growing/spreading.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Talazoparib belongs to a group of drugs called PARP inhibitors. PARP is a protein that is&#xD;
      involved with repairing damaged DNA (the genetic material of cells). Talazoparib is believed&#xD;
      to work by inhibiting (stopping) the PARP proteins from working in the cancer cells so that&#xD;
      the cancer cannot fix its damaged DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that the combination of sacituzumab govitecan and talazoparib may&#xD;
      help stop the cancer from growing and spreading by administering an anticancer drug directly&#xD;
      to the cancerous tumor(s) through sacituzumab govitecan and by stopping the cancer's cells&#xD;
      from fixing its damaged DNA through talazoparib.&#xD;

             receiving combination antiretroviral therapy when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the safety of study medications is&#xD;
             not established in pregnant women.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child-bearing potential, defined as all women physiologically capable of&#xD;
             becoming pregnant, or fertile men, unless they are using highly effective methods of&#xD;
             contraception throughout the study and after study drug discontinuation (till 8 weeks&#xD;
             in women and six months in males, post-study). Male patient should not donate sperm&#xD;
             while on treatment and up to 6 months after last dose. Women are considered&#xD;
             post-menopausal and not of child bearing potential if they have had 12 months of&#xD;
             natural (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (e.g. age&#xD;
             appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;
             oophorectomy (with or without hysterectomy) or tubal ligation at least six weeks ago.&#xD;
             In the case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has&#xD;
             been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment is she considered not of child&#xD;
             bearing potential. Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient. Periodic abstinence (e.g., calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy, or tubal ligation at least six weeks before&#xD;
                  taking study treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;
                  status of the woman has been confirmed by follow up hormone level assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Use of oral, injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception or placement&#xD;
                  of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS), or other forms of&#xD;
                  hormonal contraception that have comparable efficacy (failure rate &lt;1%), for&#xD;
                  example hormone vaginal ring or transdermal hormone contraception.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  In case of use of oral contraception, women should have been stable on the same&#xD;
                  pill for a minimum of 3 months before taking study treatment. Note: While oral&#xD;
                  contraceptives are allowed, they should be used in conjunction with a barrier&#xD;
                  method of contraception due to unknown effect of drug-drug interaction.&#xD;
