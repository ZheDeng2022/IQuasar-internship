  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Continuity of care in home care services is necessary to facilitate the assessment and&#xD;
      treatment of persons with dementia and cognitive failure. TIME (Targeted Interdisciplinary&#xD;
      Model for Evaluation and Treatment of Neuropsychiatric Symptoms) is a multi-component&#xD;
      intervention with a biopsychosocial approach, based on the theoretical framework of cognitive&#xD;
      behavioral therapy and person-centred care. The trial is designed to assess the effects of&#xD;
      TIME on Neuropsychiatric symptoms for persons (NPS) with dementia in home care services.&#xD;

      The Targeted Interdisciplinary Model for Evaluation and Treatment of Neuropsychiatric&#xD;
      Symptoms (TIME) is a multi-component intervention with a biopsychosocial approach, based on&#xD;
      the theoretical framework of cognitive behavioral therapy and person-centred care. TIME&#xD;
      consists of a manual based multicomponent program which includes a rigorous assessment,&#xD;
      treatment, and the evaluation of neuropsychiatrc symptoms (NPS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cluster RCT will contain two parallel groups, where randomisation is performed based on&#xD;
      clusters. One municipality is one cluster, randomized to receive either the intervention with&#xD;
      TIME or a brief two hours education-only intervention about dementia and NPS for the control&#xD;
      group. Totally 10 municipalities will be included. Data will be collected at baseline before&#xD;
      randomisation and at the end of the implementing phase. Measurements at patient level are&#xD;
      taken at baseline prior to randomization and after 6 months. The primary outcome measure is&#xD;
      difference in change between the intervention group and the control group from baseline to&#xD;
      follow up at 6 months in the Cornell Scale for Depression in Dementia (CSDD).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection will be performed by project nurses recruited outside the home care services.&#xD;
      They will interview the staff or family members who knows the patient best. The assessors&#xD;
      will be blinded to the randomization of the home care services. Interviews will be done by&#xD;
      telephone or face-to-face, depending on what is best for the person interviewed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the intervention focus group interviews with staff and family members will be&#xD;
      conducted.&#xD;

    <description>Totally 5 municipalities (25 persons with dementia) will be included in the intervention group, and will receive training in the TIME model. This includes two hours of lectures about dementia and neuropsychiatric symptoms (NPS) and three hours of training and roleplay in using the TIME model.

From each municipality, three staff members, called TIME administrators, will receive additional three hours of lectures and roleplay in TIME, and will thereafter have the responsibility for performing the intervention.</description>
