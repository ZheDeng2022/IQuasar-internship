  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over the last few decades, the classical two-stage surgical procedure for inserting&#xD;
      bone-anchored hearing implants (BAHIs) has been modified in adults into a single-stage&#xD;
      procedure. This approach has several advantages since it avoids a second surgical procedure.&#xD;
      The single-stage approach is proven to be safe and feasible in adults and is nowadays&#xD;
      referred to as the standard surgical technique in adults. Despite favorable outcomes and&#xD;
      advantages of the single-stage surgery, most Ear Nose Throat (ENT) surgeons still perform&#xD;
      two-stage surgery when inserting BAHI in the pediatric population. Therefore, the aim of this&#xD;
      study is to compare implant loss between single-stage BAHI surgery and two-stage BAHI surgery&#xD;
      in children aged 4 to 9 years.&#xD;

      General description:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A prospective comparative study with historical control group will be performed.The test&#xD;
      group will consist of 22 children aged 4-9 years old who are found to be suitable candidates&#xD;
      for treatment with a BAHI (BHX implant and abutment). The control group consists of&#xD;
      approximately 50 children, aged 4-9 years old, who already underwent insertion with a wide&#xD;
      diameter implant between 2012 and 2018. In the test group, BAHI insertion will be performed&#xD;
      using single-stage surgery. Patients in the control group already underwent BAHI insertion&#xD;
      using two-stage surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and consent:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children planned for implantation with bone-anchored hearing implants will be screened&#xD;
      for inclusion in the present study. Patients who meet the inclusion criteria will be&#xD;
      approached for participation by their ENT-specialist, after patients' and parents/caretakers'&#xD;
      approval they will be informed and screened for participation by one of the researchers. The&#xD;
      study protocol will be discussed with the potential study participant and his/her&#xD;
      parents/caretakers by the researcher. The potential study participant and his/her&#xD;
      parents/caretakers will be given/sent the Informed Consent Form to read. Potential study&#xD;
      participants will be encouraged to discuss the study with family members and personal&#xD;
      physician(s) before deciding whether to participate in the study. Patients and their&#xD;
      parents/caretakers have 14 days to consider their decision. In order to participate in the&#xD;
      study, both parents/caretakers need to sign the informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data handling:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data captured will be recorded in Castor using electronic Case Report Forms (eCRFs). All&#xD;
      data, patient and product related, must be accurately recorded in the eCRF by the delegated&#xD;
      site staff. All users of the Castor system have personal, password protected accounts&#xD;
      allowing tracking of all data entry in the system. Data management and data cleaning will be&#xD;
      performed in the eCRF using the queries function to ensure traceability of all data entry and&#xD;
      changes by the assigned data manager. Data including patient identifying information (i.e.&#xD;
      name, initials, birth date) will be stored on a secured network drive using a code. Only the&#xD;
      investigator who has the code can correlate the data with the patient's name and date of&#xD;
      birth. It is the responsibility of the investigator to make sure that patient identification&#xD;
      listings with patient code and identity are kept. Raw measurement data and other data such as&#xD;
      historical information will be storedin the patient file, since data may be partly acquired&#xD;
      and/or evaluated during standard patient care to limit the amount of extra procedures and&#xD;
      hospital visits. For data analyses, data will be exported and stored in a digital research&#xD;
      environment, separate from the key to the code. After completion of the study data collection&#xD;
      and final monitoring visit, the electronic database will be locked and exported to SPSS&#xD;
      format, which will be archived for 15 years after completion of the study. The coded study&#xD;
      data will be archived separately from the key to the subject code in a secured digital&#xD;
      research environment, also for a period of 15 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reporting (severe) adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator will report the Severe Adverse Events (SAEs) through the web portal&#xD;
      ToetsingOnline to the accredited Medical Ethical Committee (METC) that approved the protocol,&#xD;
      within 7 days of first knowledge for SAEs that result in death or are life threatening&#xD;
      followed by a period of maximum of 8 days to complete the initial preliminary report. All&#xD;
      other SAEs will be reported within a period of maximum 15 days after the investigator has&#xD;
      first knowledge of the serious adverse events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Device deficiency:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inadequacy of an investigational medical device related to its identity, quality, durability,&#xD;
      reliability, safety or performance. This may include malfunctions, use error, or inadequacy&#xD;
      in the information supplied by the manufacturer. Device deficiency's will be logged together&#xD;
      with an assessment by the investigator and reported to the manufacturer where applicable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up of adverse events:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Adverse Events (AEs) will be followed until they have abated, or until a stable situation&#xD;
      has been reached. Depending on the event, follow up may require additional tests or medical&#xD;
      procedures as indicated, and/or referral to the general physician or a medical specialist.&#xD;
      SAEs need to be reported until the end of study within the Netherlands, as defined in the&#xD;
      protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Monitoring and Quality Assurance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In accordance with the guidelines of the 'Dutch Federation of university medical centers'&#xD;
      (NFU) for monitoring of studies with negligible risk, a qualified monitor of another&#xD;
      department of the Radboudumc, who is not part of the research team of this study, will be&#xD;
      appointed. 28% of informed consents, 10% of inclusion and exclusion criteria (and three&#xD;
      subjects who were enrolled first), 10% source data verification, reported SAEs and 10% of&#xD;
      participants with regard to missed SAEs will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main analyses will be the comparison between the test group, in which single-stage&#xD;
      surgery is performed and the control group undergoing two-stage surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Concerning the primary outcome, the proportions of implant loss in the test and control group&#xD;
      will be compared using an exact binominal test and a one tailed confidence interval of 95%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcome measures will be compared between groups using the unpaired t-test&#xD;
      (normally distributed data or Mann-Whitney U tests (not normally distributed data) for&#xD;
      continuous variables, Mantel Haenszel chi-square test for ordered categorical variables,&#xD;
      Fisher's exact test for dichotomous variables and Chi-square test for non-ordered categorical&#xD;
      variables. If significant differences are found for baseline variables between the test group&#xD;
      and the control group a complementary analysis between the two groups will be performed with&#xD;
      adjustment for these variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Handling of missing data for secondary and tertiary endpoints (especially applicable for&#xD;
      control group data), depends on the reason why this data is missing and on the amount of&#xD;
      missing data. Therefore decisions on handling of missing data will be made after all data is&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All tests will be performed using a confidence interval of 95% and a significance level of&#xD;
      0.05&#xD;
