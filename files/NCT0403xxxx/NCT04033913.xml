  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Management of voiding dysfunction has been revolutionized by the practice of clean&#xD;
      intermittent self-catheterization (CISC) described by Lapides. It is nowadays the gold&#xD;
      standard for the treatment of urinary retention in neurogenic bladders. But increasingly,&#xD;
      CISC is prescribed to patients with non-neurogenic lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS).&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated an improvement in quality of life in patients under CISC.&#xD;
      There are several indications for CISC in older adults, either in neurological condition&#xD;
      (myelopathy following neck osteoarthritis, lumbar spinal stenosis, multiple sclerosis (MS),&#xD;
      etc…) or not (bladder outlet obstruction, underactive detrusor, etc…).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arrival of hydrophilic catheters has revolutionized management, reducing the risk of&#xD;
      traumatic and infectious complications and facilitating their use. Many catheters are now&#xD;
      available, and the choice of catheter may depend on different factors: grip disorder, ease of&#xD;
      use, design and packaging, discomfort or pain when testing a specific material, specific&#xD;
      anatomical conditions (male Tiemann or olive tip), longer catheter length in case of&#xD;
      imperfect emptying, explanations given on how to use the catheter... Thus, if the doctor and&#xD;
      the nurse involved in the patient's therapeutic education in self-catheterization will guide&#xD;
      the choice of the catheter according to medical criteria and the patient's physical&#xD;
      capacities, the patient remains an active participant in the choice of the model. Making the&#xD;
      patient an actor and decision-maker can also improve adherence to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to evaluate which are the most important criteria guiding the choice&#xD;
      of the catheter for the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators develop a questionnaire based on expert meetings and&#xD;
      literature review of the criteria that guide the choice of the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Five areas are explored: catheter design, catheter length, comfort of using the catheter,&#xD;
      nurse's explanations, easy to transport and dispose of the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The importance of each criterion is rated by a 4-level likert scale (strongly disagree,&#xD;
      somewhat disagree, somewhat agree, strongly agree) and patient have to report the most&#xD;
      important criterion for the choice of the catheter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number of types of catheter showed and tried are reported, and if they chose the first,&#xD;
      second, are two types of catheter. The questionnaire is completed at the end of a day&#xD;
      hospital to learn to perform CISC&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collected are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sex&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Etiology of urinary disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Score of the Pencil and Paper Test&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Functional Independence Measure score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nine Hold Peg Test over 18&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  &quot;Tinetti Mobility Test&quot; score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  sensory hand problems assessed by Weber test&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses will be performed with the R software for Windows (Rx64 3.2.3, R&#xD;
      Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). Descriptive data will be presented as&#xD;
      means with standard deviation for continuous data and as medians with range for ordinal data&#xD;
      and data not normally distributed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Differences between the choosing criterion and the patients' characteristics will be assessed&#xD;
      using analysis of variance or Chi2 tests. A p value of less than 0.05 will be considered&#xD;
      statistically significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study was approved by the local ethics review board.&#xD;
