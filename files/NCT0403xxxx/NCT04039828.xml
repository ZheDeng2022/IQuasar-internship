      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc (Zn) is an essential mineral widely distributed within the human body with&#xD;
      metalloproteins, Zinc-binding proteins, etc. It is necessary for signal transduction and also&#xD;
      cell growth and proliferation via respective metallo- and zinc-dependent enzymes. Zinc&#xD;
      supplementation can significantly reduce diarrheal severity and duration as well as prevents&#xD;
      future incidences and reduces use of other medications in diarrhoea. For this reason WHO,&#xD;
      UNICEF, USAID and experts worldwide jointly recommended zinc supplementation (10 mg for&#xD;
      infants less than 6 months old and 20 mg in 6 - 59 months old) combined with reduced&#xD;
      osmolarity ORS for clinical management of acute diarrhoea. But due to strong metallic taste&#xD;
      zinc products are less palatable to children even after using masking flavours as recommended&#xD;
      by WHO. Several companies have formulated the product since WHO recommendations came but&#xD;
      still transient side effects like vomiting and regurgitation remain evident. Despite careful&#xD;
      counselling to the caregivers expected adherence rate to 10 days regimen of zinc supplement&#xD;
      is yet to be reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With the aim to increase zinc supplement coverage during acute diarrheal illness, it is&#xD;
      necessary to conduct a study to introduce new formulation Zinc tablet which is more&#xD;
      palatable, more dispersible and more acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc sulfate [Zinc Dispersible Tablet, 20 mg; (Elemental Zinc 20 mg as Zinc Sulfate&#xD;
      Monohydrate / Tablet)]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Prospective, open label, interventional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improved formulation of Zinc Sulfate will have good acceptability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum 1: 3 months - &lt;18 months = 175 children Stratum 2: 18 months - 59 months = 175&#xD;
      children&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Acceptability of the zinc product in the management of childhood diarrhea will be&#xD;
           assessed by observing:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Incidence of vomiting or regurgitation among enrolled children receiving the&#xD;
           improvised zinc formulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) The adherence: The number of days (out of the total 10 days) the child took the&#xD;
           protocol-prescribed dose of the medicine. The treatment will be considered to have good&#xD;
           acceptability if at least 80% of the prescribed treatment is taken by at least 70% of&#xD;
           the children over the duration of 10 days, as per WHO guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objective :&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess palatability Secondary end point evaluation (Palatability): The statistical&#xD;
      analysis will comprise the calculation of the percentage of patients out of 350 who found the&#xD;
      investigational product to have &quot;very well-tolerated, well-tolerated or tolerated&quot; scores&#xD;
      (i.e. any of the upper 3 possible scores). A 95% confidence interval, using the normal&#xD;
      approximation of the binomial distribution, will be calculated for the percentage.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc is a metalloprotein. The two important function of zinc are- first, unlike other metals&#xD;
      zinc is virtually non-toxic (1). The homeostatic mechanisms that regulate its entrance,&#xD;
      allocation, and excretion from cells and tissues are so well-organized that no disorders are&#xD;
      known to be associated with its excessive accumulation, in contrast to iron, copper, mercury,&#xD;
      and other metals. Second, its physical and chemical properties, including its generally&#xD;
      stable relationship with macromolecules and its co-ordination flexibility, make it extremely&#xD;
      adaptable in meeting the needs of proteins and enzymes that take diverse biological functions&#xD;
      (2-4). Zinc is one of the most common metal ion distributed widely in cytoplasm as well as&#xD;
      building blocks for keratin like structures and intracellular organelles like chromosomes(5).&#xD;
      Importance of zinc as an essential trace element is well established for its role on growth&#xD;
      and development, protection against free radical damage, endocrine, reproductive and&#xD;
      cognitive functions(6). Globally, zinc deficiency is associated with 16% of lower respiratory&#xD;
      tract infections and 10% of diarrheal diseases respectively with higher attributable&#xD;
      fractions in sub-regions(7). Severe zinc deficiency is a rare entity whereas mild to moderate&#xD;
      zinc deficiency is quite evident mostly in children living in poverty and associated with&#xD;
      approximately 453,000 deaths each year(8, 9). Simultaneously, diarrhoea as the second most&#xD;
      prevalent cause of under five deaths and is responsible for 800,000 deaths each year (10). A&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 12 studies observed the impact of zinc supplements on the management of&#xD;
      acute diarrhea, 11 studies showed a reduction in the duration of the diarrheal episode. In&#xD;
      eight of these reported that the reduction of diarrheal episode was statistically&#xD;
      significant. Five of these studies also found that zinc supplements reduced stool output and&#xD;
      frequency. The data revealed that zinc supplementation had a significant effect on the&#xD;
      clinical course of acute diarrhea, reducing its duration as well as severity (11). Another&#xD;
      meta-analysis of 18 trials with 6165 enrolled participants observed that in acute diarrhea,&#xD;
      zinc reduced duration of diarrhea (MD -- 12.27 hours, 95% CI -23.02 to -1.52 hours; 2741&#xD;
      children, nine trials), and a reduced amount of diarrhea by day three (RR 0.69, 95% CI 0.59&#xD;
      to 0.81; 1073 children, two trials), day five (RR 0.55, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.95; 346 children,&#xD;
      two trials), and day seven (RR 0.71, 95% CI 0.52 to 0.98; 4087 children, seven trials). Zinc&#xD;
      also reduced the period of persistent diarrhea (MD -15.84 hours, 95% CI -25.43 to - 6.24&#xD;
      hours; 529 children, five trials). In few trials there was report on the severity, but the&#xD;
      results were not consistent (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Zinc supplementation can significantly reduce diarrheal severity and duration as well as&#xD;
      prevents future incidences and reduces use of other medications in diarrhea (13-16). Several&#xD;
      studies evaluated the effect of zinc supplementation on diarrhea and found a preventive and&#xD;
      long-lasting impact. These showed that 10 mg to 20 mg of zinc per day, for 10 - 14 days,&#xD;
      reduced the number of diarrheal episodes in 2 - 3 months after the supplementation (12). For&#xD;
      this reason WHO, UNICEF, USAID and experts worldwide jointly recommended zinc supplementation&#xD;
      (10 mg for infants less than 6 months old and 20 mg in 6 - 59 months old) combined with&#xD;
      reduced osmolarity ORS for clinical management of acute diarrhoea (17).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physiological effect of zinc on intestinal ion transport has not yet been established&#xD;
      thoroughly. In in-vitro studies with rat ileum recently established that zinc inhibits&#xD;
      cAMP-induced, chloride-dependent fluid secretion by inhibiting basolateral potassium (K)&#xD;
      channels. This study has also observed the specificity of Zn to cAMP-activated K channels,&#xD;
      because zinc did not block the calcium (Ca)-mediated pottasium channels. As this study was&#xD;
      not done in Zn-deficient animals, it provides support that Zn is probably effective in the&#xD;
      absence of Zn deficiency (18, 19). Zinc also improves the absorption of water and&#xD;
      electrolytes, improves regeneration of the intestinal epithelium, increases the levels of&#xD;
      brush border enzymes, and enhances the immune response, allowing for a better clearance of&#xD;
      the pathogens. Another report has recently shown evidence that zinc inhibits toxin-induced&#xD;
      cholera, but not Escherichia coli heat-stable, enterotoxin-induced, ion secretion in cultured&#xD;
      Caco-2 cells (20). In this way, Zinc plays an important role in modulating the host&#xD;
      resistance to infectious agents and decreases the risk, severity, and duration of diarrheal&#xD;
      diseases. It also plays an important role in metallo-enzymes, polyribosomes, and the cell&#xD;
      membrane and cellular function, giving belief that it plays a central role in cellular growth&#xD;
      and in the function of the immune system (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary site of absorption of exogenous zinc in the human is in the proximal small bowel,&#xD;
      either the distal duodenum or proximal jejunum ((22). Factors known to control absorption&#xD;
      include the amount of zinc present in the intestinal lumen, the presence of dietary promoters&#xD;
      (e.g., human milk, animal proteins) or inhibitors (e.g., phytate, other minerals), zinc&#xD;
      &quot;status&quot; especially in relation to chronic zinc intake, and physiologic states (23).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After absorption zinc is bound to protein metallothionein in the intestines. Zinc is widely&#xD;
      distributed throughout the body. It is primarily stored in RBCs, WBCs, muscles, bones, Skin,&#xD;
      Kidneys, Liver, Pancreas, retina, and prostate. The extent of Zinc binding is 60 - 70% to&#xD;
      plasma albumin, 30 - 40% to alpha 2 macroglobulins or transferring, and 1% to amino acids&#xD;
      like histidine and cysteine. Peak plasma concentration of Zinc occurs in approximately two&#xD;
      hours. The processes of secretion and reabsorption or excretion of intestinal endogenous zinc&#xD;
      have not been well characterized in humans. There are several potential sources of the&#xD;
      endogenous zinc: pancreatic and biliary secretions, gastroduodenal secretions,&#xD;
      transepithelial flux from the enterocytes or other intestinal cell types and sloughing of&#xD;
      mucosal cells.(23) Zinc sulfate, acetate, and gluconate are all acceptable zinc salt&#xD;
      formulations, of which zinc sulfate is low-cost, efficacious, safe, and therefore, optimal&#xD;
      for the national program. Zinc sulfate tablets may be dispersed in breast milk, in oral&#xD;
      rehydration solutions, or in water on a small spoon. Zinc sulfate dispersible tablet is also&#xD;
      available in the market, containing 20 mg of elemental zinc. Pediatric zinc sulfate tablets&#xD;
      are also available(24) It has been anticipated that the successful scaling up of zinc&#xD;
      supplementation for childhood diarrhea could potentially save 400,000 under-five deaths per&#xD;
      year (25). The Scaling Up of Zinc for Young Children (SUZY) Project was established in 2003&#xD;
      with the aim of setting Bangladesh on the path to covering all under-five children with zinc&#xD;
      supplementation in any diarrheal illness episode. In December, 2006 a national mass media&#xD;
      campaign to promote a dispersible tablet zinc formulation, &quot;Baby Zinc,&quot; for management of&#xD;
      childhood diarrhea was launched. All media messages linked zinc treatment to the continued&#xD;
      use of oral rehydration salts (ORS)(26). However, by 2012, zinc coverage was below 5%&#xD;
      globally though in some countries such as Bangladesh, coverage was as high as 41% (27).&#xD;
      According to WHO, Bangladesh was the only country to achieve high treatment rates nationally:&#xD;
      as of 2014 nearly 80% of children with diarrhea received ORS, and 34% received both ORS and&#xD;
      zinc (28). This was achieved through decades of investment by the government, icddr,b, the&#xD;
      international development organizations, BRAC, and other key stakeholders (29, 30). This&#xD;
      endeavor included the large-scale Scaling Up Zinc for Young Children (SUZY) Project which was&#xD;
      initiated in 2003 and included partnerships with the government, non-governmental&#xD;
      organizations (NGOs), the private sector to improve provider dispensing, caregiver demand and&#xD;
      availability of optimal, affordable products (26, 31).&#xD;
&#xD;
      But combined data collected from five RCTs (n = 3156) observed that zinc significantly&#xD;
      increased the chance of vomiting compared to the control agent (RR1.2, 95% CI 1.05-1.4)(32).&#xD;
      Due to strong metallic taste zinc products are less palatable to children even after using&#xD;
      masking flavours as recommended by WHO. Several companies have formulated the product since&#xD;
      WHO recommendations came but still transient side effects like vomiting and regurgitation&#xD;
      remain evident (33-36). Despite careful counselling to the caregivers expected adherence rate&#xD;
      to 10 days regimen of zinc supplement is yet to be reached (33, 35, 37, 38).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A clinical trial with new formulation Zinc Sulfate for use in acute diarrheal illness will be&#xD;
      conducted to achieve good adherence rate. New improvised Zinc preparation will be palatable,&#xD;
      more dispersible and thereby acceptable to young children with diarrhea.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, open label, interventional study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Site: The study will be conducted at the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for&#xD;
      Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh (icddr,b).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stratum- I : 3 months - &lt;18 months Stratum- II : 18 months - 59 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is estimated considering the primary outcome variables:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For one component of the primary objective we have considered the study-report done by Khan&#xD;
      et al (34), where they found incidence of vomiting or regurgitation in 22% of enrolled&#xD;
      children. We assume that the incidence of vomiting or regurgitation on receiving the&#xD;
      improvised zinc formula would not be greater than 10 % cases in this study, thus a total 300&#xD;
      children will be needed that would accommodate up to 19% attrition. Sample size is calculated&#xD;
      using the formula [ 2(Zα + Zβ)2 * p * q] / d2&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where:&#xD;
&#xD;
      P = (p1+p2)/2 p1 = 22% incidence of vomiting or regurgitation according to study report done&#xD;
      by Khan et al p2 = 10% incidence of vomiting or regurgitation with the improvised zinc&#xD;
      formula that we are assuming Zα = 5% significance level Zβ = (1 -β) = 80% power p = [p1 (22%)&#xD;
      + p2 (10% )]/2 = 16%; q = 100% -16% = 84%; Zα = 1.96 and Zβ = 1.64 Sample size is further&#xD;
      estimated for the other component of the primary objective, i.e. adherence. A total of 350&#xD;
      children will be enrolled (175 patients from 3 months to below 18 months age group, and 175&#xD;
      children from 18 months to 59 months age group). To identify a ± 7.5% minimal difference in&#xD;
      acceptability between children aged over and below 18 months with an anticipated 70%&#xD;
      acceptability (p), setting the level of confidence at 95% (z = 1.96) using the formula: pqz2/&#xD;
      d2 the estimated sample size is 175 children per group allowing 18% dropout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigational product: Zinc Sulfate [Zinc Dispersible Tablet, 20 mg; (Elemental Zinc 20 mg&#xD;
      as Zinc Sulfate Monohydrate / Tablet)]&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dosage:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Half the tablet (10 mg) for 3 to 6 months old children and 20 mg daily for &gt; 6 to 59 months&#xD;
      old children. The tablet will be dissolved in a teaspoon of safe water or breast milk and&#xD;
      administered once daily for 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Packaging and labeling: Investigational product will be dispensed in a blister pack&#xD;
      containing 10 tablets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The caregivers will bring the blister packs (even if all tablets are used) on day 11 (after&#xD;
      enrollment) for a follow up visit to the outpatient department (OPD) of the Dhaka Hospital of&#xD;
      icddr,b, and they will be evaluated about the adherence with the supplied drug intake during&#xD;
      the follow up visit. Study investigator will update accountability records of the&#xD;
      investigational product according to ICH E6, GCP guideline. If caregiver failed to have the&#xD;
      follow up visit at hospital, the study staff will visit children's house after 12 days of&#xD;
      enrollment. Investigational product will not be provided to any third party.&#xD;
