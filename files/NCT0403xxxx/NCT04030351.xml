  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Most adults consume acid-producing diets because their high intake of protein and/or cereal&#xD;
      grains in relation to their intake of fruits and vegetables. This study is being done to&#xD;
      determine whether acid-base balance can be restored by the addition of dried fruits to the&#xD;
      diet. In this study adults with low usual fruit intake will be provided with either 100 g per&#xD;
      day of a mix of dried fruits or no dried fruit. Participants will be followed for 1 year.&#xD;
      Acid-base status will be assessed by measuring the acid content in 24-hour urine collections.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Most adults consume acid-producing diets because their intake of protein and/or cereal grains&#xD;
      is high in relation to their intake of fruits and vegetables. Supplementation with alkaline&#xD;
      salts such as potassium bicarbonate and potassium citrate have been shown to reduce 24-hr&#xD;
      urinary net acid excretion (NAE) in healthy adults. This approach requires taking many&#xD;
      capsules daily, in split doses after each meal with a full glass of water. An alternative and&#xD;
      perhaps more acceptable approach to achieving acid-base balance for most adults may be to&#xD;
      modify their diet by increasing intake of alkali-producing foods, such as fruit. Maintaining&#xD;
      acid base balance may be important for preserving bone and muscle and renal function and&#xD;
      other outcomes but this has not been established. The investigators propose to determine&#xD;
      whether adults who are provided with 100 g per day of a selection of dried fruits will&#xD;
      actually consume enough of it to correct their acid-producing diets, as evidenced by a&#xD;
      lowering of their urinary NAE. The investigators will also determine whether and how&#xD;
      participants will alter their overall diets or their body weight when provided with the dried&#xD;
      fruit. The comparator group will receive no dried fruit (or other intervention).&#xD;
