  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine serous carcinoma (USC) is an uncommon, but aggressive variant of endometrial&#xD;
      carcinoma that has poor response to standard therapy. After staging and surgery, radiation&#xD;
      therapy and/or chemotherapy is recommended to treat patients at high risk for recurrence. In&#xD;
      advanced stage and recurrent setting, high risk uterine cancer mirrors ovarian cancer with it&#xD;
      spread patterns and response to therapy. Based on these findings and the similarities as well&#xD;
      as the clinical success of paclitaxel with IP platinum therapy in patients with ovarian&#xD;
      serous carcinoma, investigators propose to prospectively assess IV/IP therapy in patients&#xD;
      with advanced stage and recurrent USC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During Week 1-18, subjects will be placed on open-label IP Carboplatin/IV Paclitaxel on Day&#xD;
      1, then administered IP Paclitaxel on Day 8. This will be repeated every 3 weeks for 6&#xD;
      cycles. A CT imaging scan will be performed after six cycles of chemotherapy, prior to&#xD;
      radiation. Also, in Week 19-23, subjects will receive Pelvic radiation therapy (IMRT) if&#xD;
      deemed necessary. Additionally, from Week 24-26, High Dose Radiation or IMRT will be used&#xD;
      where appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be monitored for toxicity and feasibility of the regimen. Secondary outcomes&#xD;
      will include assessing the frequency and the reasons for early discontinuation of the study&#xD;
      treatments as well as describing patient-reported quality of life parameters at specified&#xD;
      time points during the study using validated questionnaires: EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-OV28.&#xD;

      TREATMENT PLAN 5.1 Dosing Guidelines 5.1.1 Chemotherapy Paclitaxel is available commercially.&#xD;
      Paclitaxel 135mg/m2 will be given over 1 hour in 250-500 ml of 5% dextrose or normal saline.&#xD;
      Premedication for prevention of anaphylactic reactions with anti-histamines and/or steroids&#xD;
      should be administered as per standard practice. Paclitaxel should be given first given the&#xD;
      risk of immediate drug sensitivity reaction. Following on Day 8 of the cycle, paclitaxel will&#xD;
      be given IP at 60mg/m2. After infusion the patient will be asked to change position at&#xD;
      15-minute intervals for two hours to ensure adequate intra-abdominal distribution. No attempt&#xD;
      will be made to retrieve the infusate, however if a large amount of ascites is present,&#xD;
      ascites may be drained by paracentesis or accessed port prior to instillation of drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Carboplatin is available commercially. Carboplatin should be reconstituted in 500-1000cc of&#xD;
      normal saline warmed to 37 °C (when feasible) and infused through a peritoneal catheter as&#xD;
      rapidly as possible. It is preferred that an additional 1000 ml of warm saline is infused&#xD;
      after IP Carboplatin, or 500ml of warmed normal saline infused before and after IP&#xD;
      Carboplatin to help with drug dispersion throughout the peritoneal cavity, for a total volume&#xD;
      of approximately two liters. After infusion the patient will be asked to change position at&#xD;
      15-minute intervals for two hours to ensure adequate intra-abdominal distribution. No attempt&#xD;
      will be made to retrieve the infusate, however if a large amount of ascites is present,&#xD;
      ascites may be drained by paracentesis or accessed port prior to instillation of drug.&#xD;
      Carboplatin at an AUC of 6.0 will be administered intraperitoneally (if there is a prior&#xD;
      history of radiotherapy, AUC of 5 would be used). AUC based dosing as described by Calvert et&#xD;
      al. will be according to the following formula: Dose (mg) = AUC x (GFR + 25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial GOG trial using combination paclitaxel and carboplatin therapy was performed on&#xD;
      patients with optimally debulked ovarian epithelial carcinoma.40 At that time, the&#xD;
      carboplatin dose was an AUC of 7.5. Since then, multiple large cooperative trials have been&#xD;
      performed using AUCs of 6.0 and even 5.0. The lower dosage of carboplatin does not appear to&#xD;
      compromise the efficacy of the drugs, and is associated with less toxicity.41-43 Where AUC is&#xD;
      as stated above and GFR is the calculated renal function according to the method of Cockcroft&#xD;
      and Gault: GFR (ml/min) = 0.85 x {(140-age)/Scr)} x {wt(kg)/72}.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Where Scr is the serum creatinine level. Investigators will use GFR of 125ml/min as cutoff as&#xD;
      per NCI guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following 6 cycles of IV/IP chemotherapy, a CT of chest, abdomen and pelvis should be&#xD;
      obtained for disease surveillance prior to proceeding with radiotherapy (See section 5.4). If&#xD;
      clinically indicated, the primary oncologist may have the option to proceed with the CT&#xD;
      imaging after 3 cycles of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1.2 Antiemetic Regimens&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nausea and vomiting is anticipated as a side effect. The following representative antiemetic&#xD;
      regimen is suggested:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ondansetron 8-32 mg IV or PO 30 minutes prior to administration of chemotherapy and&#xD;
      dexamethasone 10-20 mg IV or PO 30 minutes prior to drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aprepitant 125 mg PO one hour prior to chemotherapy on day 1 and 80 mg daily PO on days 2 &amp; 3&#xD;
      for patients having nausea or vomiting with carboplatin (the intravenous formulations may be&#xD;
      substituted when available).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Granisetron 10 mcg/kg IV (or 2mg PO) 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy, dexamethasone 10-20 mg&#xD;
      IV 30 minutes prior to chemotherapy 5.2 Intraperitoneal device specifications: Insertion of&#xD;
      peritoneal catheter may be done by the following procedures as listed below: 1) at time of&#xD;
      original laparotomy 2) laparoscopic placement 3) interventional radiology guided placement.&#xD;
      Silicone catheters are preferred. Controversy exists between the use of venous 9.6 silicone&#xD;
      catheters or silicone IP ports with fenestrations. Bardport silicone peritoneal catheter 14.3&#xD;
      Fr (Reorder number 0603006) is the preferred catheter. This has been FDA approved for IP&#xD;
      therapy. The 9.6 Fr single lumen IV access device is also acceptable. Equivalent or similar&#xD;
      devices are acceptable if silicone large enough not to kink and without a Dacron cuff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure at time of original laparotomy:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. AT the completion of the laparotomy just prior to closing the incision, make a 3-4&#xD;
           centimeter incision over the lower costal margin on the side where the catheter is to be&#xD;
           placed. The incision is carried down to the fascia using blunt and sharp dissection.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A subcutaneous pocket superior to the incision is fashioned slightly larger than the&#xD;
           diameter of the portal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Select an area several centimeters below and lateral to the umbilicus as the peritoneal&#xD;
           entrance site of the catheter. Prepare a subcutaneous tunnel from the portal pocket to&#xD;
           the site in the peritoneal cavity for the catheter to enter the abdomen and draw the&#xD;
           catheter through the subcutaneous tissue into the abdomen using a tunneling device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Attach the catheter to the portal as per manufacturer's instructions and suture the&#xD;
           portal in place with permanent suture (i.e. 2-0 prolene) to the fascia overlying the rib&#xD;
           cage. Be sure the chemotherapy nurses will be able to feel the port and stabilize it on&#xD;
           the chest wall for easy access with Huber needle in the future. Be sure the Huber needle&#xD;
           will not have to go through the wound to access the port; the port should lie superior&#xD;
           to the port incision site.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. After flushing the system with heparin 100 units per ml to determine that flow is not&#xD;
           obstructed and no leaks exist, place the distal end of the catheter to the desired&#xD;
           infusion site, with at least 10 cm of free catheter in the abdomen. Do not allow the&#xD;
           catheter to be long enough to reach the bladder, vagina or rectum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Close incisions and place a Huber needle trans-dermally into the portal if the catheter&#xD;
           is going to be irrigated in the immediate postoperative period. Wait a minimum of 24&#xD;
           hours prior to treating patient after IP port placement, and wait for return of&#xD;
           gastrointestinal function (regular diet tolerated and normal bowel movement) after major&#xD;
           laparotomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postoperative procedure with mini laparotomy (video available at SGO.org and GOG.org)&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Select a site several centimeters below and lateral to the umbilicus and make an&#xD;
           incision through skin, subcutaneous tissue and fascia. Separate rectus muscle and enter&#xD;
           peritoneum. Knowledge of the previous surgical resections and current anatomy will&#xD;
           assist in choosing location.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Pull the catheter from subcutaneous tissue into the peritoneal cavity through the full&#xD;
           thickness of the abdominal wall (fascia, muscle, peritoneum) from an adjacent location&#xD;
           (not through the incision) while under direct visualization to prevent injury to bowel.&#xD;
           This can be accomplished with a tonsil clamp or tunneling device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The catheter must be left in the abdominal cavity at least 10 cm to prevent migration&#xD;
           out of the peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The opposite end of the catheter is tunneled up to the costal margin where it is&#xD;
           attached to an implanted port as described above. The catheter is left long enough to&#xD;
           not retract, but not long enough to reach vagina, rectum or bladder. It is generally&#xD;
           left at least 10 cm into the peritoneal cavity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative laparoscopically assisted surgical implantation of Port&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Laparoscopic placement of an IP catheter is usually feasible from a left upper quadrant&#xD;
           approach. Knowledge of the previous procedures performed (i.e. bowel resections and&#xD;
           anastomosis sites) and location of the tumor will inform the surgeon as to the best&#xD;
           approach and what locations to avoid.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Once the peritoneal cavity can be visualized, a second puncture can be used to gain&#xD;
           access to the peritoneal cavity and then the catheter is tunneled in the subcutaneous&#xD;
           tissues to the planned Port pocket.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Port placement under Interventional Radiologic guidance&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interventional radiology may also place IP catheters, if preferred by treating provider.&#xD;
      Knowledge of anatomy and the best sites for placement should be communicated between the&#xD;
      primary provider or surgeon and the radiologist. CT or ultrasound can allow direct access to&#xD;
      peritoneal cavity, followed by subcutaneous tunneling to the anterior chest wall for&#xD;
      appropriate port placement and catheter attachment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation therapy will be delivered at provider discretion after the 6th cycle of&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Factors: All treatment will be delivered by megavoltage equipment ranging from 6 MV&#xD;
      to a maximum of 25 MV photons. Cobalt-60 equipment will not be acceptable for treatment on&#xD;
      this protocol. Tomotherapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Localization and Simulation Methods: Localization images taken on the conventional or&#xD;
      CT-simulator will be necessary in all cases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment Plan and Dose Specification: Patients may be treated with either conventional&#xD;
      radiation therapy approaches or with IMRT. The use of individualized custom blocking is&#xD;
      required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Daily Tumor Dose, Total Dose, and Overall Treatment Time: A daily tumor dose of 180 cGy per&#xD;
      day will be given to a total dose of 4500 cGy (180 cGy x 25 treatments) in approximately five&#xD;
      weeks. Treatment will be given 5 days a week, from Monday through Friday Dose Distribution&#xD;
      (Site): Dose to the CTV should not vary by more than +/- 5% from the prescribed dosage for 3D&#xD;
      conformal plans. The use of tissue wedges and/or compensating filters may be necessary to&#xD;
      accomplish this goal. As a general rule, only pelvic radiation therapy will be given, unless&#xD;
      there is imaging, intra-operative, histologic, or other evidence of para-aortic node&#xD;
      involvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If there is tumor extension into the vagina, the external beam fields will be modified to&#xD;
      include the disease volume with at least a 2 cm margin. For involvement of the distal 1/3 of&#xD;
      the vagina, inguino-femoral nodes should also be covered in the external beam RT ports. If&#xD;
      the patient's tumor extends into the cervix, or invades deeply and extends into the lower&#xD;
      uterine segment, or if there is lymph-vascular space invasion by tumor, or if the tumor has&#xD;
      extended into the vagina, such a patient will receive intravaginal boost brachytherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiation Therapy Volumes and Technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pelvic field: 3D Conformal&#xD;
&#xD;
      Portal and Treatment Volume Definition:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The boundaries are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      AP/PA Fields: Cephalad Border:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A transverse line drawn within 2 cm of the L5-S1 interspace or higher if necessary to include&#xD;
      known areas of lymph node involvement by tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      AP/PA Fields: Caudal Border:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mid-portion of the obturator foramen or a minimum of 4 cm margin on the vaginal cuff,&#xD;
      preferably defined by marker seed placement or by placement of a vaginal swab at the time of&#xD;
      simulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral Borders: &gt;1 cm beyond the lateral margin of the true pelvis at its widest points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alternatively, use of a CT scan to outline the target vessels with a border of at least 1 cm&#xD;
      is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lateral Pelvic Fields:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cephalad and caudal borders are same as above.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anterior Border:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A horizontal line drawn anterior to the symphysis pubis. When extended in the cephalad&#xD;
      direction, this line should pass at least 1 cm anterior to known nodal regions or, in the&#xD;
      absence or radiographic documentation, the line should pass at least 1.5 cm anterior to the&#xD;
      L5 vertebral body. Individualized custom blocks can be used to achieve this goal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Posterior Border:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cephalo-caudal line passing through the third sacral vertebra. Every effort should be made&#xD;
      to include the upper vaginal stump with a margin of at least 3 cm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IMRT Patient Immobilization: Prior to simulation, it is recommended that radiopaque marker be&#xD;
      inserted into the vaginal apex to help to identify the area by CT scan. Patients are to be&#xD;
      immobilized in the supine position in an immobilization device. Patients are to be treated in&#xD;
      the immobilization device. CT scan thickness should be 3 mm or smaller through the region&#xD;
      that contains the PTV, extending from at least L3-4 level to below the perineum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simulation: CT simulation is required to define clinical target volume (CTV) and planning&#xD;
      target volume (PTV). The CT scan should be acquired in the same position and immobilization&#xD;
      device as for treatment. The use of IV contrast and bowel prep-contrast are highly&#xD;
      recommended for better delineation of the contrast-enhanced pelvic vessels used as a&#xD;
      surrogate for regional nodal delineation, as well as small bowel contouring, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contouring the Target volumes:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please refer to the RTOG Gynecological Atlas for volume specification. The atlas may be&#xD;
      accessed on the RTOG website at: http://www.rtog.org/gynatlas/main.html The Clinical Target&#xD;
      Volume (CTV) is defined as the vaginal apex in addition to pelvic nodal regions lying within&#xD;
      the field borders given in Section 4.61. If gas/stool distends the rectum, the CTV is to be&#xD;
      expanded to include the anterior half of the rectum to account for evacuation of the rectum.&#xD;
      The nodal portion of the CTV should include the internal (hypogastric and obturator), and&#xD;
      external iliac lymph node regions. The CTV should be delineated using the contrast enhanced&#xD;
      (preferably IV contrast administered) iliac vessels, in addition to the perinodal soft tissue&#xD;
      (minimum of 6 mm axial margin around the vessels). Bone and intraperitoneal small bowel&#xD;
      should be excluded from the CTV as much as possible (leaving at least 6 mm margin around the&#xD;
      vessels). Approximately 1-2 cm of tissue anterior to the sacrum (S1-S3) may be added to the&#xD;
      CTV for adequate coverage of pre-sacral nodes, although this is optional and at the&#xD;
      discretion of the treating radiation oncologist. In addition the most antero-lateral margin&#xD;
      of the external iliac nodes that lie just proximal to the inguinal canal should be excluded&#xD;
      from the CTV (nodal CTV should stop at the femoral head). Proximally, the CTV should end 7 mm&#xD;
      from the L5-S1 interspace to account for the PTV. The CTV should include the inguino-femoral&#xD;
      nodes if the distal one-third of the vagina is involved with tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The PTV should provide a 7 mm-1 cm margin in all directions around the CTV. The definitions&#xD;
      of volumes will be in accordance with the 1993 ICRU report #50. Prescribing, recording and&#xD;
      reporting photon beam therapy and 1999 ICRU report #62.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critical normal surrounding structures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bladder will be contoured in each slice in which it appears. Rectum will be contoured in each&#xD;
      slice in which it appears. As a general guideline, the radiation oncologist can consider the&#xD;
      maximum caudal extent of the rectum to lie 1.5-2.0 cm from the bottom of the ischial&#xD;
      tuberosities. Superiorly, judgment will be required to establish where the rectum ends and&#xD;
      the sigmoid colon begins. The transition to the sigmoid colon is marked by increased&#xD;
      curvature and tortuosity in its path. Bowel will be contoured in each slice in which it&#xD;
      appears, 2 cm above the PTV as bowel bag and inferiorly to the rectosigmoid junction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Femoral heads will be contoured in all the slices in which they appear. Constraints:&#xD;
      Participants are strongly encouraged to respect the following limits, whether 3-D conformal&#xD;
      or IMRT approaches are used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Small bowel: &lt;30% to receive ≥ 40Gy, Dmax &lt;46 Gy Rectum: &lt; 80% to receive ≥ 40Gy, Dmax &lt;55 Gy&#xD;
      Bladder: &lt; 50% to receive ≥ 45Gy, Dmax &lt;60 Gy Femoral heads: &lt; 50% to receive ≥ 40Gy, Dmax&#xD;
      &lt;50 Gy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radiotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachytherapy: If a vaginal brachytherapy boost is to be given based on the criteria given in&#xD;
      the protocol. It should commence within 2 weeks of completion of the external beam RT. It&#xD;
      should be delivered with a vaginal cylinder (HDR or LDR) or colpostats (LDR), and in the&#xD;
      absence of gross residual disease following surgery the treating physician must choose one of&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A) HDR: 600 cGy x 2-3, weekly, prescribed at the vaginal surface. Dose optimization should be&#xD;
      used in an effort to create reasonable homogeneity of dose around the surface of the&#xD;
      applicator. A minimum of 4 cm of vaginal length should be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      B) LDR 2000-3500 cGy prescribed at the vaginal surface in 1 insertion at a dose rate of&#xD;
      40-100 cGy/hr. A minimum of 4 cm of vaginal length should be treated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical Factors If an intravaginal boost is to be used, it should be delivered with an&#xD;
      intravaginal cylinder (HDR or LDR). Acceptable isotopes include cobalt or iridium for HDR,&#xD;
      radium or cesium for LDR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8.1 Duration of Follow Up Patients will be followed for every 3 months for the first two&#xD;
      years, and every 6 months for three years and yearly thereafter, or until death, whichever&#xD;
      occurs first. In total, patients will be followed for a maximum of 10 years. Testing such as&#xD;
      CA-125 or CT scans may be performed at discretion of the primary physician once off-study.&#xD;
      Patients removed from study for unacceptable adverse events will be followed until resolution&#xD;
      or stabilization of the adverse event.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.1 Pre Study Evaluation This evaluation requires completion within 21 days of registration,&#xD;
      unless otherwise described. Baseline requirements will consist of a thorough history and&#xD;
      physical examination. An ECG &lt; 6 months prior to registration and laboratory tests will be&#xD;
      obtained. Tests include, CBC with differential, platelet count, serum chemistry, including&#xD;
      electrolytes, creatinine, BUN, glucose, magnesium, calcium, albumin, phosphorous, liver&#xD;
      function tests, CA-125, and urinalysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Histological documentation of UPSC is required. Pre-study CA125, CT scan of chest, abdomen&#xD;
      and pelvis, and CXR (not required if CT of the chest is available) will be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.2 Tests during Treatment: Please refer to Appendix A (Study Schedule) Weekly: CBC with&#xD;
      differential and platelet count Every 3 weeks (each cycle): CBC with differential and&#xD;
      platelet count electrolytes, BUN, creatinine, glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorous,&#xD;
      albumin, CA125. Every 3 weeks (each cycle): Complete review of systems and complete physical&#xD;
      examination, including pelvic examination, clinical evaluation for ototoxicity and&#xD;
      neuropathy. Weight and performance status will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.3 End of Study Evaluation This evaluation includes a complete history and physical&#xD;
      examination and documentation of weight and performance status. Laboratory tests include a&#xD;
      complete blood count with differential and platelet count, electrolytes, BUN, creatinine,&#xD;
      glucose, magnesium, calcium, phosphorous, albumin, CA125 and urinalysis. CT scan of chest,&#xD;
      abdomen and pelvis will be obtained at the completion of the entire IP/carboplatin protocol&#xD;
      or earlier if indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      10.4 Follow-up Patients will be evaluated every 3 months for the first 2 years and every 6&#xD;
      months for the next 3 years. Evaluation at each visit includes a complete history and&#xD;
      physical examination and documentation of weight and performance status. Laboratory tests to&#xD;
