    <textblock>
      REGONIVO is a Phase Ib study to explore the efficacy and safety of regorafenib in combination&#xD;
      with nivolumab in the treatment of gastric cancer and colorectal cancer with MSS. The study&#xD;
      enrolled 50 patients with advanced disease, including 25 cases of gastric cancer, 25 cases of&#xD;
      colorectal cancer, except for one case of colorectal cancer with MSI-H, and others were MSS&#xD;
      type. The results of the study showed that patients with colorectal cancer had an objective&#xD;
      response rate (ORR) of 36% and a progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on the preliminary results of the REGONIVO study, the aim of this phase 2 study is to&#xD;
      explore the safety and efficacy of regorafenib and nivolumab in combination with radiotherapy&#xD;
      with or without irinotecan in previously treated metastatic colorectal cancer patients with&#xD;
      pMMR/MSS.&#xD;

    <description>The PFS is defined as the time from the start of treatment to the date of first documented PD or death as a result of any cause, whichever occurred first. When a patient was alive and without progression, PFS was censored at the date of the last disease assessment. The PFS rates at 6 months was estimated from Kaplan-Meier curves.</description>
