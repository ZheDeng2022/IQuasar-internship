  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Due to the increasing sedentary behaviors in older adults, it is important to understand the&#xD;
      factors related to sedentary behaviors. Although systematic reviews have identified&#xD;
      sociodemographic and environmental factors related sedentary behaviors, no study on the&#xD;
      relationships between interested and important activities and sedentary behaviors in older&#xD;
      adults was found.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, investigators aim to investigate the relationships among interested and&#xD;
      important activities, sedentary behaviors, and sociodemographic factors in older adults&#xD;
      living in the community. Investigators will recruit 30 sedentary older adults living in the&#xD;
      community who are cognitively intact, have no physical limitations, and are medically stable.&#xD;
      Participants will be assessed once using subjective and objective measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) estimated energy expenditure levels for interested, important, and current activities, 2)&#xD;
      time spent on sedentary activities, and 3) sociodemographic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will provide supporting evidence for the role of meaningful&#xD;
      occupations to decrease sedentary behaviors. In addition, the results may show the relevant&#xD;
      sociodemographic factors that occupational therapy practitioners need to be aware when&#xD;
      encouraging active lifestyle for sedentary older adults in the community.&#xD;

    <time_frame>One time during the initial, one-time study visit about their current stauts (participants are visited only once in the study)</time_frame>
    <description>The Activity Card Sort assesses the participation level in instrumental, leisure, and social activities. The Activity Card Sort uses 89 photographs. For each photograph, participants will be asked if they are interested in doing the activity in each photograph, if the activity in each photograph is important for them to do, and if participants are currently doing it. Then, Three mean metabolic equivalent levels of interested, important, and current activities will be calculated.</description>

    <description>The information will be used to determine the characteristics of the participants and generalizability of the results, and to determine the relationships with interested, important, and current activities. The form collects socio-demographic information, such as race, gender, highest education received, living status, occupations, total household annual income, recent hospitalization, cardiovascular risk factors, the number of medications taken daily, and weekly exercise level. Information is all self-reported.</description>
