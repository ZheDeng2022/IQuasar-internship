      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vector-borne diseases are caused by the bite of an infected mosquito, fly, flea, tick, or&#xD;
      other blood-feeder. These diseases cause almost 1 million deaths per year. And they are on&#xD;
      the rise, particularly in Southeast Asia in particular. Researchers think that these diseases&#xD;
      make up about 10 percent of fevers in Cambodia. But many of these illnesses are never&#xD;
      diagnosed. Studying these diseases can help find new ways to identify and treat them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find pathogens in people who have a fever using metagenomic pathogen sequencing platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 6 months to 65 years with a fever of at least 38 degrees Celsius who visit the&#xD;
      referral hospital in Cambodia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with their medical history. Children will be weighed to make&#xD;
      sure they are big enough to give blood samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will share data about their sex, age, and where they live. They will answer more&#xD;
      questions about their heath history. They will answer questions about and any places to which&#xD;
      they have recently traveled. They will take a questionnaire. They will have a blood test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants aged 2 years or older who test positive for malaria will have one more blood&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation will last up to 2 days....&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Vector-borne diseases continue to cause significant global morbidity and mortality,&#xD;
      particularly in Southeast Asia. However, given a lack of diagnostics available in&#xD;
      resource-poor countries, many vector borne diseases are never diagnosed and therefore their&#xD;
      impact is underappreciated. Cross sectional retrospective surveys have revealed higher than&#xD;
      expected antibody prevalence to a number of diseases including mosquito-borne viruses and&#xD;
      ectoparasite borne rickettsial diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here, we aim to collect specimens from febrile individuals to better describe the febrile&#xD;
      disease landscape of Cambodia using novel genomics technologies (unbiased next-generation&#xD;
      sequencing) to investigate possible infectious etiologies of illnesses of unexplained&#xD;
      etiology in Cambodian children and adults. If sequencing identifies a highly transmissible&#xD;
      pathogen of public health concern, we will take a convalescent sample from the individual and&#xD;
      screen his/her close contacts with serological assays to add an additional layer of&#xD;
      understanding to the disease burden. With the current rise of vector-borne diseases around&#xD;
      the world, we hope the results of this study contribute to better understanding the&#xD;
      epidemiology and burden for vector-borne diseases in this region.&#xD;
