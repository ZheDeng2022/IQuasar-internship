      A randomised clinical trial to assess the impact of group singing on health for people with&#xD;
      chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Singing for lung health (SLH) is a novel approach intended to improve the health status of&#xD;
      people with respiratory disease. In group sessions, a trained singing leader teaches vocal&#xD;
      techniques, which improve breathing control and posture, in the context of an enjoyable&#xD;
      non-disease related activity. Initial pilot studies and qualitative work have established the&#xD;
      concept that SLH can produce physical, psychological and social benefits. A properly&#xD;
      conducted efficacy study is needed before larger scale trials, addressing impacts over a&#xD;
      longer term and effect on health resource utilisation, can be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN: An assessor blind, parallel group, randomised controlled trial, to assess the effects&#xD;
      of SLH compared to usual care on health status. The investigator will also evaluate the&#xD;
      impact on physical activity, physical performance, and breathlessness perception to&#xD;
      investigate the mechanisms involved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research question and outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be change in health status, assessed using the Short Form 36 tool&#xD;
      (SF-36), comparing SLH and control arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additional endpoints will be: the COPD assessment test score (CAT), the MRC dyspnoea score,&#xD;
      Dyspnoea-12, Activities-specific Balance Confidence scale (ABC scale).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For psychological health, anxiety will be assessed using the GAD-7 and depression using the&#xD;
      PHQ-9.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity will be assessed using the cPPAC PROactive physical activity in COPD tool&#xD;
      (a combination of questionnaire and actigraphy). Physical capacity using the six-minute walk&#xD;
      test, and physical performance using the short physical performance battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments: At an initial baseline assessment a structured clinical history will take place&#xD;
      and the diagnosis confirmed by spirometry. The outcomes outlined above will be recorded at&#xD;
      baseline and then after 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POPULATION: Adult patients with COPD will be recruited from primary and secondary care as&#xD;
      well as through advertising. Diagnosis will be based on clinical history, confirmed by&#xD;
      spirometry and a history of smoking. Participants in the active arm will attend once weekly&#xD;
      SLH groups for 12 weeks. The comparison arm will receive usual care. Randomization will be&#xD;
      stratified by prior participation in pulmonary rehabilitation and by MRC dyspnoea score, to&#xD;
      ensure groups are matched.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAMPLE SIZE Sample size: Based on pilot data, where the standard deviation (SD) for change in&#xD;
      SF-36 was 15 points, to identify a clinically relevant 10 point difference in SF-36 responses&#xD;
      at a 0.05 level of significance with a 90% power would require 48 patients in each treatment&#xD;
      arm. Allowing for 20% dropout the investigator will therefore recruit 120 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary analysis will be on an intention to treat basis. Change in parameters will be&#xD;
      assessed comparing SLH/control using Generalised Linear Models to estimate treatment effects.&#xD;
      In order to better understand changes in the SF-36 &quot;anchor measure&quot;, the investigator will&#xD;
      relate this to changes in measures of breathlessness, physical activity, capacity and&#xD;
      performance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An additional responder analysis will compare the proportion in each treatment arm achieving&#xD;
      a clinically important (10%) improvement in SF-36.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addendum: Due to the COVID-19 pandemic an it became inappropriate to continue delivering&#xD;
      group singing sessions in person, so the first group of participants is to complete their 12&#xD;
      weeks of intervention using online delivered sessions. This relates the first group of 18&#xD;
      participants had been recruited, randomised, baseline assessments completed and begun the&#xD;
      intervention. Their follow-assessments will be posted to participants for them to complete at&#xD;
      home. All assessment measures will be the same as originally stated, however the 6MWT and&#xD;
      SPPB require clinical supervision, so will not be completed. The results from this group will&#xD;
      be reported separately to the rest of the study who will complete the original protocol when&#xD;
      the situation with COVID-19 has improved, and it is safe for participants to do so. An&#xD;
      appropriate amendment to ethical approval has been made. Data from the control group may also&#xD;
      be reported separately, being of interest in itself, as a natural experiment regarding the&#xD;
      impact of social distancing and shielding measures on people with COPD. Again, the variables&#xD;
      assessed will not change.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Addendum 2: Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the study will continue to be conducted&#xD;
      remotely, as described above, with online delivery of the singing intervention and remotely&#xD;
      collected outcome measures. Most recent clinical spirometry will be used for COPD diagnosis&#xD;
      confirmation. Due to no longer being able to conduct the object assessments of physical&#xD;
      performance mean daily step count will also be reported as a secondary outcome measure. For&#xD;
      clarification, the exclusion criteria of previous participation in Singing For Lung health,&#xD;
      refers to no participation in the last year. Appropriate amendments to the ethical approval&#xD;
      have been made.&#xD;
