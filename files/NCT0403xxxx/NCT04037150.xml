  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      -  The investigators will prospectively recruit 100 NSCLC patients. The cfDNA samples will&#xD;
           be gathered before the surgery and postoperatively 4-6 weeks after surgery and at 6 and&#xD;
           12 months follow-up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This study aims to investigate the role of ctDNA in NSCLC patients treated with curative&#xD;
           intent surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative ctDNA will be compared to primary tumor DNA to investigate the concordance&#xD;
           of mutations and gained mutations from possible primary tumor cancer stem cell.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Preoperative ctDNA findings will be tested for associations with baseline&#xD;
           characteristics as well as clinically important factors such as TNM stage,&#xD;
           histopathological findings, and tumor volume.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The investigators aim to identify molecular residual disease (MRD) using multiple ctDNA&#xD;
           samples after the surgery and search the associations with clinical recurrence and&#xD;
           survival, with possible correlation to palliative chemotherapy response&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using multiple ctDNA samples, the investigators will gather information about tumor&#xD;
           heterogeneity, diversity of disease genotypes, and dynamic changes in ctDNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  If additional data from palliative immunotherapy (PD-L1 inhibitors) is available, the&#xD;
           effect of this will be evaluated in the study.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Plasma liquid biopsy is rapidly emerging non-invasive diagnostic tool that could be used as a&#xD;
      surrogate for tumor biopsy or disease activity. Circulating cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is short&#xD;
      fragment double stranded DNA that is present in blood. Ultrasensitive mutation specific&#xD;
      techniques based on polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) analysis are required to detect mutations&#xD;
      and alterations in circulating tumor cells. Early studies based on a small number of patients&#xD;
      indicate that ctDNA analyses could be used for molecular testing, cancer detection, surrogate&#xD;
      for tumor burden or activity, and treatment monitoring in solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the current study the role of ctDNA from plasma in surgically treated early stage NSCLC&#xD;
      patients will be investigated. The investigators aim to collect a prospective cohort of a&#xD;
      hundred patients with preoperative and follow-up samples as well as diagnostic tissue&#xD;
      specimen. The investigators hypothesize that longitudinal ctDNA-samples could be used as&#xD;
      prognostic marker for recurrence and survival. Finding postsurgical positive ctDNA could aid&#xD;
      us to identify patients who would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy before clinical&#xD;
      recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and ethical considerations&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a prospective, non-interventional, single arm study that will be conducted in&#xD;
      collaboration with Helsinki Biobank. It is estimated that cohort of 100 patients will provide&#xD;
      with ample sample size, as 30-40% will develop a recurrence during the 5 year follow up. A&#xD;
      preliminary agreement with Helsinki Biobank about the sample collection and storage has been&#xD;
      made. There will be no additional study appointments as all the control visits and study&#xD;
      samples are scheduled according to normal clinical protocol. The patients will be recruited&#xD;
      from 1.5.2019 to 31.12.2020. The recruited patients will provide both a written informed&#xD;
      consent for this study and a Helsinki Biobank consent that covers plasma and surgical&#xD;
      samples. Participants can withdraw the consent at any time of the study. The Biobank samples&#xD;
      will be taken simultaneously with clinical samples, minimizing the additional harm to&#xD;
      participants. A Helsinki University Hospital (HUS) institution review board permission (HUS&#xD;
      60/2019) and ethical statement has been granted (455/2019). The study will be conducted in&#xD;
      accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients are recruited prior to surgery from preoperative multidisciplinary team (MDT)&#xD;
      meeting. The inclusion criteria into this study is histologically confirmed NSCLC eligible&#xD;
      for surgical treatment and naïve for systemic oncological treatments with either&#xD;
      formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue or fresh frozen tissue sample available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical patient data will be collected from electronic medical records (EMR) at each&#xD;
      point of time (e.g. preoperative, operative, follow-up). Each patient is evaluated in MDT&#xD;
      meetings before and after the surgery, where the both the clinical and the pathological stage&#xD;
      is determined. In addition, radiological consolidation/tumor ratio will be calculated from&#xD;
      preoperative computerized tomography (CT) scans. This data will be transferred to a secure,&#xD;
      certified electronic database (Granitics Unify Med) with access only by group researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood and tissue sample collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      The blood and tissue samples will be taken simultaneously with clinical samples. The&#xD;
      investigators aim to collect surgically removed tissue samples as well as preoperative and&#xD;
      follow-up cfDNA samples from all patients. In addition to surgical samples, tissue samples&#xD;
      will be collected from metastatic lesions including autopsy samples in deceased patients. If&#xD;
      not already taken, the standard Biobank blood sample will be taken simultaneously to&#xD;
      preoperative samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Plasma samples will be taken at the time of the patient's clinical blood samples. A&#xD;
      preoperative sample will be taken 1-2 day before the surgery. The first post-operative&#xD;
      follow-up sample will be taken at the surgical visit 4-6 weeks after the operation. The&#xD;
      second and third follow-up samples will be taken at 6 and 12 months during clinical follow-up&#xD;
      visit. At each time point, cfDNA samples will be collected into duplicate specialized&#xD;
      collection tubes containing fixatives to stabilize DNA from fragmentation (2 x 10ml Streck&#xD;
      cfDNA BCT). Blood sample will be centrifuged to extract plasma. Plasma and tissue samples&#xD;
      will be stored at -80 celsius in Helsinki Biobank.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study outcomes Preoperative ctDNA mutations will be matched to clinically important endpoints&#xD;
      such as disease-free survival, tumor size, histology, TNM-stage, and overall survival. The&#xD;
      clinical cancer recurrence will be obtained from radiological or tumor tissue samples.&#xD;
      Disease free survival will be assessed from surgery to disease recurrence in MDT meetings or&#xD;
      death. Overall survival is assessed from surgery to death as a result of any cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative and mutation specific ctDNA analysis will be made via tumor/somatic exome genome&#xD;
      panel that includes 23.000 gene panel with 50 million bases. Germline DNA isolation will be&#xD;
      done from buffy coat taken from patients' blood sample (B-Bio-0). Firstly, to achieve true&#xD;
      somatic mutations the germline variation is deleted from the ctDNA. Secondly, ctDNA will be&#xD;
      compared to tumor tissue DNA mutations to exclude false positive findings. Thirdly, similar&#xD;
      or new mutations collected from follow-up samples will be used to detect postsurgical&#xD;
      residual disease or cancer recurrence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sequencing will be done in collaboration with Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland&#xD;
      (FIMM), with their proprietary gene paneling.&#xD;
