    <textblock>
      This is an unblinded, randomized clinical study comparing the efficacy of DNA damaging&#xD;
      chemotherapy using carboplatin, to standard of care therapy for patients who have metastatic&#xD;
      castrate resistant prostate cancer. This trial will use olaparib or carboplatin as initial&#xD;
      therapy with crossover to the alternate or second-line drug after first progression for&#xD;
      patients with tumors containing BRCA1, BRCA2 or PALB2 inactivating DNA mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are randomized (1:1) and receive either carboplatin (AUC 5, IV) every 21 days,&#xD;
      first or olaparib taken orally (300 mg), twice daily in 28 day cycles, until intolerance,&#xD;
      complete response, or progression by Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants then crossover from the first-line therapy to the second-line therapy with the&#xD;
      opposite study medication and receive treatment to intolerance or progression (whichever is&#xD;
      first). Enrolled participants will be allowed to crossover to second line therapy if they&#xD;
      continue to meet initial eligibility criteria, and at least three weeks have elapsed since&#xD;
      last administration of either carboplatin or olaparib. Throughout the study, safety and&#xD;
      tolerability will be assessed. Progression will be evaluated with bone scan, CT of the&#xD;
      abdomen/pelvis, or MRI and PSA as per PCWG3 criteria.&#xD;

      Study General Trial Over-view&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is designed to help better understand treatment options compared to standard&#xD;
      therapies for patients who have targeted BRCA1, BRCA1 and/or PALB2 genetic mutations and&#xD;
      metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer therapies are aimed at finding a way to kill the cancer cells while causing minimal&#xD;
      damage to normal (non-cancer) cells. This often works because cancers cells grow faster than&#xD;
      many normal cells, many treatments are aimed at to take advantage of that difference. One of&#xD;
      the ways to do this is to damage the DNA of these more rapidly growing cells. However, if the&#xD;
      cells have a way of repairing that damage then therapies may not work as well. Some research&#xD;
      shows that when specific changes or mutations occur in the genes involved with repairing DNA&#xD;
      damage, resulting cancers have responded well to drugs which damage DNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Olaparib is known as a PARP inhibitor and is standard of care therapy for men with BRCA&#xD;
      altered mCRPC. Carboplatin is a synthetic antineoplastic agent which has been used in the&#xD;
      treatment of solid tumors and BRCA related cancers. When mutations occur in critical&#xD;
      DNA-repair genes, research has found that treatment with carboplatin is also effective.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This research is being done to determine the response of mCRPC in patients with DNA repair&#xD;
      mutations to treatment with olaparib compared to carboplatin. This study will test whether&#xD;
      giving one drug or the other a has a better response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients wishing to participate in this study are screened for safety and health eligibility&#xD;
      before enrolling.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is enrolling 100 male participants total, from across the VAMC nationally who have&#xD;
      the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cancer that has gotten worse, after any number of first-line treatments&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mutations in DNA-repair genes discovered as part of a patient's routine care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once eligibility is determined, enrolled participants are randomized into one of two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group A will start with carboplatin (IV) first, given every 21 days, then have the&#xD;
           option to switch to the second treatment with olaparib taken daily, (orally) with cycles&#xD;
           of every 28 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group B will start with olaparib first, taken (orally), with 28 day cycles, then have&#xD;
           the option to switch to the second treatment with carboplatin (IV) every 21 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both study drugs in this trial are currently FDA approved, and are prescribed at the&#xD;
      participating VAMC clinical sites per institutional guidelines. Carboplatin given in IV is&#xD;
      also given as prescribed at the participating VAMC, and administered per institutional&#xD;
      guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are monitored for health and body function, cancer progression, toxicity and&#xD;
      life quality at every visit during the trial and at an end of treatment visit (28 days after&#xD;
      completion of the trial or after withdrawal). For participants who respond well to treatment&#xD;
      during the trial, additional treatment cycles may be added and the study can be extended.&#xD;
      Participants who experience intolerable toxicity, cancer progression, or whose doctors decide&#xD;
      to change treatment, will either be switched to the opposite study drug or withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This important trial is designed to compare response rate and duration of response using&#xD;
      carboplatin compared to olaparib in patients who have mCRPC which contains DNA repair gene&#xD;
      mutations.&#xD;
