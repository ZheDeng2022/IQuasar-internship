  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bullous pemphigoid (BP) is the most common of the autoimmune blistering skin diseases in&#xD;
      Western Europe. [Joly 2012]The study will recruit the new onset or relapsing mild to moderate&#xD;
      BP patients. The study population will consist of patients above the age of 18 years with an&#xD;
      active episode of BP, confirmed by inclusion and exclusion criteria and who, in the opinion&#xD;
      of the Investigator, would benefit from treatment with rVA576. Recombinant rVA576 is a small&#xD;
      protein complement C5 and LTB4 inhibitor, which prevents the cleavage of C5 by C5 convertase&#xD;
      and thereby inhibits generation of C5b-9 the membrane attack complex (MAC), as well as&#xD;
      preventing the release of the anaphylatoxin C5a. rVA576 is effective in inhibiting terminal&#xD;
      complement activity irrespective of the activating pathway (classical, lectin or&#xD;
      alternative). This Phase IIa open-label single-arm study will evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of rVA576 in adult mild to moderate Bullous Pemphigoid patients&#xD;
