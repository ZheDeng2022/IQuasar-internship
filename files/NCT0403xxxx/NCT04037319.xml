  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will report the incidence of atrial fibrillation after elective colorectal cancer&#xD;
      resection in the over 65 age group. This will be used to validate a risk model for the&#xD;
      development of post-operative atrial fibrillation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible patients will undergo electrocardiogram based screening for atrial fibrillation, as&#xD;
      well as brain natriuretic peptide tests prior to surgery. They will undergo 24 hour holter&#xD;
      monitor prior to surgery, and at 30 and 90 days following surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will be occurrence of atrial fibrillation within 90 days of surgery.&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include quality of life change, use of hospital services for atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation, and complications of atrial fibrillation. This will be used to validate the&#xD;
      pre-existing model for prediction of atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

      Background Atrial fibrillation is an irregularly irregular heartbeat and occurs in around&#xD;
      1.5% of the population. It is associated with negative clinical outcomes such as cardiac&#xD;
      failure and mortality. It is strongly implicated in the evolution of stroke, which carries&#xD;
      significant burden and cost to patients and the National Health Service (NHS). Atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation can be triggered by major physiological stresses such as surgery. The literature&#xD;
      suggests that symptomatic atrial fibrillation occurs in 10% of patients within 90 days of&#xD;
      surgery. This means that a proportion of patients may have undetected atrial fibrillation,&#xD;
      and require treatment to reduce their risk of complications. As the investigators move&#xD;
      towards stratified and personalised medicine, it is important to identify the characteristics&#xD;
      of the patients at risk of developing atrial fibrillation after surgery in order to mitigate&#xD;
      the effects of the condition. This research group has proposed a basic model to stratify&#xD;
      patients into high risk groups for post-operative atrial fibrillation, although this requires&#xD;
      testing and refinement in a prospective study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims To estimate the rate of atrial fibrillation following colorectal cancer surgery and to&#xD;
      characterise patients at highest risk of atrial fibrillation following surgery for colorectal&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method A prospective study of patients over the age of 65 undergoing colorectal cancer&#xD;
      resection will be conducted across 15 colorectal units in the United Kingdom. It will recruit&#xD;
      720 patients over an 18 month period. The study has been designed with regard to public and&#xD;
      patient involvement. Patients over the age of 65 undergoing surgery for colorectal cancer&#xD;
      with curative intent and no prior diagnosis of atrial fibrillation will be eligible for&#xD;
      inclusion. Participants will be screened prior to entry with an electrocardiogram (ECG).&#xD;
      Following consent, routine demographic data, EQ-5D-5L (five dimension), and blood sample for&#xD;
      Brain Natriuretic Peptide (BNP) will be collected. A 24-hour cardiac rhythm recording will be&#xD;
      undertaken prior to surgery to confirm the absences of atrial fibrillation. ECG will be&#xD;
      repeated on the day of discharge and 24 hour rhythm recordings repeated at 30 and 90 days&#xD;
      post surgery. EQ-5D-5L x will be recorded at 90 days along with any use of health services&#xD;
      for cardiac symptoms. Participants diagnosed with atrial fibrillation during the study will&#xD;
      be directed to local inpatient or primary care services as appropriate. Demographic&#xD;
      characteristics, ECG parameters and BNP will be combined with a previously derived model and&#xD;
      tested for ability to predict atrial fibrillation.&#xD;

    <description>Quality of life change as measured using EQ-5D-5L from baseline to 90 days post-surgery calculated as population adjusted health index based on total score. In the UK population this can range from -0.594 to 1.0. Higher values are associated with better quality of life scores. A positive change in quality of life index means improved quality of life.</description>
