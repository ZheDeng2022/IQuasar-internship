      Study Name: The CorNeat EverPatch - a First-In-Man Clinical Study for demonstrating the&#xD;
      Safety of a Synthetic Tissue Substitute for concealment of artificial implants and glaucoma&#xD;
      tube shunts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the Safety of the Corneat&#xD;
      Everpatch for concealment of artificial implants and glaucoma tube shunts&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will consist 10 subjects requiring concealment of a glaucoma shunt or other&#xD;
      ophthalmic implant. Eligible subjects who signs an ICF will be enrolled to the study.&#xD;
      Subjects will be implanted with the Corneart EverPatch as part of a glaucoma shunt surgery or&#xD;
      during a corrective surgery to repair a breached conjunctiva over an implanted device.&#xD;
      Subjects will be monitored for a period of 12 months post-op during which follow up visits&#xD;
      will occur at 1 week, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 &amp; 12 months following surgery including clinical&#xD;
      examination of the operated eye using slit-lamp biomicroscopy and imaging using OCT or UBM&#xD;
      (will be performed only at the 6 &amp; 12 months follow up visits).&#xD;

      Study Name: The CorNeat EverPatch - a First-In-Man Clinical Study for demonstrating the&#xD;
      Safety of a Synthetic Tissue Substitute for concealment of artificial implants and glaucoma&#xD;
      tube shunts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this clinical trial is to demonstrate the Safety of the Corneat&#xD;
      Everpatch for concealment of artificial implants and glaucoma tube shunts&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Safety Endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The frequency of all Unanticipated Adverse Device-related Events (UADE) or treatment-related&#xD;
      adverse events, during and following implantation and follow-up for up to 12 months will be&#xD;
      10% or less.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effectiveness Endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary: Conjunctival integrity at the implantation site will be 90% or more. Secondary:&#xD;
      Stability in patch dimensions, less than 10% change (length, projected width and thickness)&#xD;
      measured by OCT after 1-week and follow-up for up to 12 months post-implantation in 90% of&#xD;
      the implanted patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intended uses: The CorNeat EverPatch intended use is concealment of artificial ophthalmic&#xD;
      implants and glaucoma tube shunts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The clinical investigation of the CorNeat EverPatch device is essential to validate its&#xD;
      safety and efficacy in its target implantation site and to substantiate regulatory clearance.&#xD;
      Clinical investigation of a medical device must be in compliance with Good Clinical Practice&#xD;
      as set forth in ISO 14155, which addresses good clinical practices for the design, conduct,&#xD;
      recording and reporting of clinical investigations carried out in human subjects for the&#xD;
      purpose of assessing the safety and performance of medical devices for regulatory purposes,&#xD;
      as well as applicable local laws and regulations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: 10 subjects requiring concealment of artificial ophthalmic implants and&#xD;
      glaucoma tube shunts. Unilateral and bi-lateral. The device can be implanted in patients'&#xD;
      right or left eye (selection according to Principle Investigator's discretion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Subjects will be followed-up for 12 months from device implantation date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit Schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Screening: Day 0-7, Subjects will sign an Informed Consent Form (ICF) on screening visit&#xD;
      and baseline assessments for clinical condition, concomitant medication and medical history&#xD;
      data will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Implantation: Implantation day will be recorded as day 0; enrollment day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Follow up visits at 1 week, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9 &amp; 12-month post-op (total of 7 follow up visits).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each follow up visit, subjects will be evaluated for: (i) conjunctival integrity; (ii)&#xD;
      device dimensions, (iii) clinical evaluation; (iv) device retention and (v) any clinically&#xD;
      necessary interim safety exam per PI decision. Additionally, at 6 &amp; 12 months post-op,&#xD;
      subjects will undergo an imaging evaluation of the device's dimensions (either by UBM or&#xD;
      OCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety Assessment: A record of UADE as well as incidence and nature of Serious Adverse Events&#xD;
      (SAE) will be recorded. Incidence and nature of Adverse Events (AE) will be collected&#xD;
      throughout the study starting from implantation. The following types of events are outside of&#xD;
      this category:&#xD;
&#xD;
      (i) Adverse events related to the disease such as glaucoma and not caused by implant&#xD;
      concealment (ii) Adverse events related to the primary implant such as tube shunt blockage&#xD;
      not related to implant concealment&#xD;
