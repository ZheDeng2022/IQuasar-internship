  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Consumptive coagulopathy is associated with increased mortality in patients with heart&#xD;
      failure (HF). Physical activity influences the risk of major vascular thrombotic events. This&#xD;
      study investigates how high-intensity interval training (HIIT) affects the capacity of&#xD;
      endogenous thrombin generation (TG) by modulating circulatory procoagulant microparticles&#xD;
      (MPs) in HF patients. Thirty-eight HF patients and 38 age- and gender-matched normal&#xD;
      counterparts (NC) were recruited into this study. The HF group performed HIIT (3-min&#xD;
      intervals at 40% and 80%VO2peak) on a bicycle ergometer for 30 min/day, 3 days/week for 12&#xD;
      weeks, whereas the NC group did not receive any form of intervention. Plasma TG kinetics,&#xD;
      procoagulant MPs, coagulation-related factors, and oxidative stress/proinflammatory status&#xD;
      were analyzed. The results demonstrated that the HF group exhibited (i) less endogenous&#xD;
      thrombin potential (ETP) and TG rate, (ii) lower concentration/activity of tissue factor (TF)&#xD;
      and counts of TF-rich MPs derived from blood cells, and (iiii) higher vascular endothelial&#xD;
      shedding and plasma myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 concentrations, compared to the NC&#xD;
      group did. However, HIIT elevated plasma ETP and TG rate, as well as, TF&#xD;
      concentration/activity and blood cell-derived procoagulant MP levels in the HF patients.&#xD;
      Moreover, the exercise regimen also decreased vascular endothelial shedding and plasma&#xD;
      myeloperoxidase and interleukin-6 concentrations in patients with HF. Hence, we conclude that&#xD;
      HF reduces the capacity of endogenous TG in plasma, which is associated with decreased (or&#xD;
      consumed) circulatory procoagulant MP levels. However, HIIT alleviates HF-declined endogenous&#xD;
      TG capacity and vascular endothelial damage through recuperating TF-related coagulation&#xD;
      activity and suppressing oxidative stress/proinflammatory status.&#xD;
