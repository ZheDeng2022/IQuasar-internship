      Design: Prospective observational diagnostic study and methods-comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of the project is to better define the pathogenic microorganisms in patients&#xD;
      with microbial keratitis (MK) through a better understanding of the corneal and ocular&#xD;
      surface microbiome in health and disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This will be achieved through the following objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Using NGS, analyse the corneal microbiome of the affected and unaffected eye of patients&#xD;
           with and without MK and compare with simultaneous results from CDC and MTPCR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Determine the microbiological spectrum of the cornea, ocular surface and contiguous&#xD;
           structures, in patients with MK, healthy controls, contact lens wearers and eye drop&#xD;
           users.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A comparison of isolation rates and identified bacteria obtained from CDC, MTPCR and NGS&#xD;
           processing of MK corneal samples will be made.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Microorganisms identified in the eyes with MK will be compared to the fellow eye and&#xD;
           other control groups and subtractive bioinformatics methodology applied to identify the&#xD;
           most likely pathogenic organisms compared to those seen in the healthy corneal and&#xD;
           ocular surface microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Comparisons of the relative abundance of microorganisms obtained from MK corneal samples&#xD;
           over the participant's follow-up visits will be used to evaluate longitudinal changes in&#xD;
           the corneal and ocular surface microbiome during treatment and resolution of MK.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. A direct comparison between the relative abundance of microorganisms isolated from&#xD;
           participants cornea, conjunctiva, eyelids and nose (contiguous structures) will be made&#xD;
           to identify any possible endogenous sources of infection for MK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Population Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All patients aged 18 years and over presenting with unilateral clinically suspected MK&#xD;
           to St. Paul's Eye Unit, The Royal Liverpool University Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients with keratoconus undergoing cross-linking, subjects with no history of MK,&#xD;
           subjects with no history of MK who are contact lens wearers and subjects with no history&#xD;
           of MK but who are on eye drop treatment for glaucoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration: Three years.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Microbial keratitis (MK) is an ophthalmological emergency that can lead to sight threatening&#xD;
      complications such as corneal scarring, perforation, endophthalmitis and ultimately&#xD;
      blindness. The patient requires aggressive topical antimicrobial therapy and close treatment&#xD;
      response monitoring, often including hospitalisation followed by frequent outpatient visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Improving outcomes depends on rapidly identifying the causative microorganism. Currently the&#xD;
      likely causative microorganism is only isolated in around 30 to 40% of cases using&#xD;
      traditional scraping methods and standard conventional diagnostic culture (CDC), with results&#xD;
      typically taking up to 4 days to become available to the clinician [1]. More sensitive&#xD;
      methods such as microorganism targeted polymerase chain reaction (MTPCR) and metagenomic&#xD;
      analysis increase the potential to detect microorganisms but may increase the likelihood of&#xD;
      picking up commensal microorganisms, making it difficult for the treating clinician to&#xD;
      interpret which of the isolated organisms is likely to be causative in MK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the barriers to identifying the organisms has been the difficulty in collecting&#xD;
      samples from the cornea. In 2015, a group led by Professor Kaye at the University of&#xD;
      Liverpool developed a non- invasive corneal sampling methodology using a corneal impression&#xD;
      membrane (CIM) made from polytetrafluoroethylene [2]. This was shown to have a significantly&#xD;
      higher overall isolation rate compared to conventional scraping methods. As it is minimally&#xD;
      invasive, the CIM sampling method offers a unique opportunity to sample both the affected&#xD;
      cornea and unaffected cornea of patients presenting with MK as well as the eyes of patients&#xD;
      unaffected by MK. This will enable us to obtain a much better understanding of the clinical&#xD;
      significance of isolated organisms in MK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metagenomic next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques enable the genomic analysis of all&#xD;
      the microbes in a sample, giving a wealth of information regarding the presence and&#xD;
      interaction of microorganisms as well as the presence or absence of antimicrobial resistance&#xD;
      (AMR) genes. Previous studies attempting to characterise the ocular surface microbiome in&#xD;
      health using metagenomics have demonstrated a diverse resident homeostatic microbiome,&#xD;
      however, have been limited to swabs taken from the lid, conjunctiva and tears rather than the&#xD;
      cornea [3-5]. Variations in the microbiome have been associated with conditions such as dry&#xD;
      eye syndrome, contact lens wear and infectious pathologies, including a pathological&#xD;
      microbiome dominated by pseudomonas spp. in a small number of patients with bacterial&#xD;
      keratitis [4-6]. Despite the cornea being the surface affected by MK, there is no data&#xD;
      regarding the healthy corneal microbiome because traditional sampling methods have been&#xD;
      invasive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite NGS generating personalised results in a matter of hours, its sensitivity to detect&#xD;
      all organisms present without an understanding of their clinical significance is a barrier to&#xD;
      its introduction into clinical practice. In this project, we aim to use the CIM sampling&#xD;
      method and NGS processing to improve understanding of the causative organisms in MK.&#xD;
      Furthermore, through sampling both the affected and unaffected eyes of MK patients and from&#xD;
      those without MK, we will be able to develop a diagnostic rule in order to identify and&#xD;
      discount commensal organisms. The inclusion of different control groups will also provide&#xD;
      information on the influence of contact lenses and eye drops on the microbiome, which have a&#xD;
      role both on the development and treatment of MK. This will greatly facilitate current&#xD;
      interpretation of corneal sample results and facilitate potential future use of NGS in&#xD;
      routine ophthalmic clinical practice.&#xD;
&#xD;

      The overall aim of the project is to better define the pathogenic microorganisms in patients&#xD;

&#xD;
      Study Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Prospective observational diagnostic study and methods-comparison.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Duration: Three years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Number and type of subjects:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will recruit 151 patients with MK for derivation of the diagnostic NGS strategy with ulcer&#xD;
      characteristics. This is based on the sample size calculation below.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size calculations: Current standard diagnostic reference method (CDM) has a diagnostic&#xD;
      accuracy of 40%. For clinical implementation of NGS, diagnostic accuracy will be required to&#xD;
      increase to at least 80%. NGS can only increase the proportion of detected micro-organisms.&#xD;
      To estimate a diagnostic rate of 80% with a 95% confidence interval (of width 15%) 137&#xD;
      participants are required. This calculation assumes that the smallest diagnostic group has a&#xD;
      prevalence of 20%. To adjust for a 10% rate of possible loss of follow-up, we will recruit&#xD;
      151 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also recruit 90 participants to four control groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. 20 patients with no history of MK who use no eye drop medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. 20 patients with no history of MK who are contact-lens wearers&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. 20 patients who have no history of MK but are on eye drop treatment for glaucoma. This&#xD;
           group has been included to assess for changes in the corneal microbiome that could be&#xD;
           secondary to drop treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. 30 patients with keratoconus who are undergoing cross-linking will be recruited. These&#xD;
           participants as part of the routine cross-linking procedure will have their corneal&#xD;
           epithelium removed. This removed epithelium from an otherwise healthy corneal surface&#xD;
           will allow for a direct comparison between the corneal microbiome characterised from the&#xD;
           CIM and that characterised directly from the epithelium.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical data collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      At presentation, patient demographics, risk factors (ocular surface disease, contact lens&#xD;
      wear, previous MK), and treatment received in the past or using at presentation will be&#xD;
      obtained from interview, together with ulcer characteristics (major and minor axes of the&#xD;
      corneal ulcer measured using a continuous scale). A standardised data collection form will be&#xD;
      utilised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), size, location and depth of the ulcer will be recorded&#xD;
      using a slit lamp biomicroscope. Ulcer size (minor and major axes) and location (minimum&#xD;
      distance from the limbus) will be measured. Ulcer depth will be measured on a nominal scale&#xD;
      of 1-4 based on percentage of remaining corneal thickness underneath the ulcer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specimen Collection&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each participant, the following samples will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Three CIMs from the affected and unaffected eyes of participants with MK, or from one&#xD;
           eye of control participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Swabs from conjunctiva of the participant's affected and unaffected eyes, upper eyelids&#xD;
           and nose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three CIMs will be applied (PTFE Millipore culture insert, pore size 0.40micrometres) to the&#xD;
      surface of the cornea for 5 seconds and one CIM to the participants inferior fornix&#xD;
      conjunctiva for 5 seconds using sterile gloves. A topical anaesthetic (one drop of 0.5%&#xD;
      proxymethacaine) will be instilled into the lower conjunctival fornix prior to application of&#xD;
      the CIMs. The first CIM sample obtained from the participants cornea will be placed and&#xD;
      transported in a bottle containing 0.5mL of BHI broth for culture. The CIMs obtained from the&#xD;
      participants cornea and the inferior conjunctiva will be kept dry in a sterile tube. In&#xD;
      addition to the collection of samples described, the corneal epithelium removed from patients&#xD;
      undergoing corneal cross-linking will be placed in a sterile eppendorf and stored at -80 C.&#xD;
      Swabs will be taken from the participant's conjunctiva, upper eyelids and anterior nares in&#xD;
      order to characterize the surrounding microbiome and endogenous sources.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MK participant follow up&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants presenting with clinically suspected MK will be followed up at 3 days, 7 days&#xD;
      and 1 month following presentation, as per normal procedure for follow-up of MK. At each&#xD;
      follow up appointment BCVA, size and depth of the ulcer will be recorded. All samples will be&#xD;
      repeated at each follow up appointment from the participants affected eye only. These will&#xD;
      include three corneal CIMS, conjunctival, upper eyelid and nasal swabs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Processing of samples and identification of microorganisms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. CDC (established diagnostic standard): Blood, chocolate, and Sabouraud's dextrose agar&#xD;
           plates and a 24-hour subculture of the BHI broth inoculated with the bacterial swabs and&#xD;
           membranes will be examined for evidence of bacterial growth after 24 and 48 h&#xD;
           incubation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. MTPCR:DNA will be extracted and quantified from the CIM and virology conjunctival swab.&#xD;
           A multiplex microorganism targeted PCR (MTPCR) master mix, including primers for HSV-1,&#xD;
           HSV2, acanthamoeba, 16S and 18S ribosomal DNA will be prepared and PCR performed using a&#xD;
           real-time PCR instrument&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. NGS: Metagenomic testing will be performed using high-throughput platforms, such as the&#xD;
           Illumina HiSeq 4000. Sequencing depth will be determined empirically. Genome alignments,&#xD;
           filtering and pathogen calling will be performed using established pipelines. An&#xD;
           analysis approach based on read classification will be applied for taxonomic&#xD;
           classification. A subtractive analysis method based on removal of host DNA and healthy&#xD;
           control eye metagenome will be applied.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A comparison of isolation rates and identified bacteria obtained from CDC, MTPCR and NGS&#xD;
      processing of MK corneal samples will be made. This will be visualised using a Venn Diagram.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For NGS data, we will work with the Centre of Genomic Research (CGR) to assign taxonomy&#xD;
      labels and calculate relative abundances in each sample. For detection of AMR, software will&#xD;
      be used to directly map reads to those in a comprehensive AMR database and report the AMR&#xD;
      genes present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Microorganisms identified in the eyes with MK will then be compared to the control fellow eye&#xD;
      and other control groups and subtractive bioinformatics methodology applied to identify the&#xD;
      most likely pathogenic organisms compared to those seen in the healthy corneal microbiome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparisons of the relative abundance of microorganisms obtained from MK corneal samples over&#xD;
      the participant follow up visits will be used to evaluate longitudinal changes in the corneal&#xD;
      microbiome during treatment and resolution of MK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A direct comparison between the relative abundance of microorganisms isolated from&#xD;
      participants cornea, conjunctiva, eyelids and nose will be made to identify any possible&#xD;
      endogenous sources of infection for MK. Overlaps of microorganisms between the sample sites&#xD;
      will be visualised using a Venn diagram and non-parametric tests used to assess for&#xD;
      differences between the sample sites.&#xD;
