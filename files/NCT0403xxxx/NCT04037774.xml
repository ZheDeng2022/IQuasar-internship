      SYNOPSIS:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparison of different doses of intra-thecal dexmedetomidine as an additive to low-dose&#xD;
      bupivacaine(5mg) in selective spinal anesthesia for transurethral resection of prostate in&#xD;
      elderly patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most patients scheduled for Transurethral Resection of the Prostate Gland are elderly and&#xD;
      usually present with cardiovascular, endocrine, renal, cerebral or respiratory diseases&#xD;
      thereby increasing their risk for surgery and anaesthesia. Spinal anesthesia is the technique&#xD;
      of choice in transurethral resection of prostate . The major problem of spinal technique is&#xD;
      risk of hypotension. In spinal anesthesia due to sympathetic blockade, there is&#xD;
      vasodilatation leading to diminished venous return which is the main contributory factor for&#xD;
      hypotension. 1 Selective spinal anesthesia , commonly known as saddle block, is defined as&#xD;
      &quot;the practice of employing minimal doses of intrathecal agents so that only the nerve roots&#xD;
      supplying a specific area and only the modality that require to be anesthetized are&#xD;
      affected.&quot; Thus, Selective spinal anesthesia is more appropriate in elderly patients3 Saddle&#xD;
      block paralyzed pelvic muscles and sacral nerve roots. As lower level of block is achieved,&#xD;
      hemodynamic derangement is less and fluid requirement is also less. So there is minimum&#xD;
      chance of circulatory overload1 but may provide insufficient surgical anaesthesia.5and also&#xD;
      may not achieve an extended duration of postoperative analgesia.2 Dexmedetomidine is a highly&#xD;
      selective alpha2 adrenoceptor (α2-AR) agonist recently introduced to anaesthesia practice. It&#xD;
      produces dose-dependent sedation, anxiolysis and analgesia (involving spinal and supraspinal&#xD;
      sites) without respiratory depression7 intrathecal Dex has been used as an adjuvant to&#xD;
      different local anesthetics in humans with various doses ranging from 2.5 to 15 micrograms&#xD;
      [2,3,9-15] resulting in improving the quality of sensory and motor blockade and increasing&#xD;
      their duration and decreasing the dose of local anesthetic used intrathecal Dex has been used&#xD;
      as an adjuvant to different local anesthetics in humans with various doses ranging from 2.5&#xD;
      to 15 micrograms [2,3,9-15] resulting in improving the quality of sensory and motor blockade&#xD;
      and increasing their duration and decreasing the dose of local anesthetic used intrathecal&#xD;
      Dex has been used as an adjuvant to different local anesthetics in humans with various doses&#xD;
      ranging from 2.5 to 15 micrograms, resulting in improving the quality of sensory and motor&#xD;
      blockade and increasing their duration and decreasing the dose of local anesthetic used.4&#xD;
&#xD;
      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The charactereistics of a spinal block varies with the dose of local anaesthetic and the&#xD;
      adjuvant used. Literature review did not show comparison of different doses of&#xD;
      dexmedetomidine with low-dose bupivacaine in saddle block. The rationale of this study is to&#xD;
      determine an optimum dose of dexmedetomidine which in combination with low dose bupivacaine&#xD;
      would provide satisfactory block with hemodynamic stability. This would be beneficial for&#xD;
      patients scheduled for transurethral resection of prostate, as these patients are mostly&#xD;
      elderly with various comorbidities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate and compare the effects of Two doses of intra-thecal dexmedetomidine (5 and 10&#xD;
      µgrams) with 5mg hyperbaric bupivacaine, and 5mg hyperbaric bupivacaine alone in saddle block&#xD;
      for ,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  onset and regression of sensory block times,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  peak sensory block,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  hemodynamic changes,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  adequate surgical conditions&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  duration of effective post-operative analgesia&#xD;
&#xD;
      Operational definations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      MEAN ARTERIAL PRESSURE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The arithmetic mean of the blood pressure in the arterial part of the circulation, it is&#xD;
      calculated by adding the systolic pressure reading to two times the diastolic reading and&#xD;
      dividing the sum by 3.&#xD;
&#xD;
      record arterial blood pressure and mean heart rate for both groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adequate surgical conditions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory block height till T12 and adequate relaxation of pelvic floor muscles will be&#xD;
      considered optimal surgical conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative analgesia:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time from intrathecal drug administration till demand of first rescue analgesia is considered&#xD;
      as effective post-opertaive analgesic period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      onset of sensory block: Time from intrathecal drug injection till achievement of highest&#xD;
      sensory block level would be labelled as onset of sensory block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regression of sensory block:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Time from intrathecal drug injection till two segment sensory regression from peak sensory&#xD;
      level .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: higher doses of dexmedetomdine with low dose bupivacaine provide more&#xD;
      prolongation of effective post-operative analgesia, as compared too low doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: single blind prospective randomized control trial. Setting: After approval from&#xD;
      ethical committee, this study will be conducted at the Department Of Anesthesiology and&#xD;
      Surgical Intensive Care Unit , services Hospital Lahore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of study: The proposed study will be completed in six months after approval of&#xD;
      synopsis from services institute of medical sciences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size is calculated by taking mean time to 2 segment regression in minutes from&#xD;
      following data, 116±20.1 vs 130 ± 15.5 At significance level of alpha 5% , confidence level&#xD;

&#xD;
      Male gender, age between 50 and 70 years old and Patients' physical status by the American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologist (ASA): ASA class I, II and III&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Contraindications of spinal anesthesia, Patients who were taking α2-adrenergic agonist or&#xD;
      antagonist therapy, Patients who were having labile hypertension, uncontrolled cardiac&#xD;

      mental retardation or deafness and Allergy to the drug or local anesthetics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Seventy five elderly male patients in the age group between 55 and 75 years and American&#xD;
      Society of Anesthesiologists Grade I-III undergoing Transuretheral resection of prostate will&#xD;
      be included in this study. Using a computer-generated random number table, patients will be&#xD;
      enrolled in one of the two groups, Group I: will receive 5 mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine&#xD;
      hydrochloride( 1ml) with 5 micro grams of dexmedetomidine (1ml). Total drug volume will be&#xD;
      2ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group II : will receive 10 μg of dexmedetomidine hydrochloride(1ml) combined with 5mg of 0.5%&#xD;
      hyperbaric bupivacaine hydrochloride. Total drug volume will be 2ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group III: will receive 5mg of 0.5% hyperbaric bupivacaine(1ml) with 1ml of Normal sline as&#xD;
      placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each patient will recieve an appropriate randomised number allocated to his group according&#xD;
      to the number, sealed and packed inside opaque covers and labelled with the project title,&#xD;
      investigators' name and the randomisation number..&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard monitoring including electrocardiogram , pulse oximetry and noninvasive blood&#xD;
      pressure will be attached to the patients upon their arrival to the operating room. Baseline&#xD;
      parameters will be recorded, and monitoring will be initiated. Intravenous access will be&#xD;
      secured using 18Gauge cannula. patients will be made to position is sitting position for&#xD;
      institution of saddle block. Complete aseptic precautions including cleaning with povidone&#xD;
      iodine and draping will be performed. The L3/L4 or L4/L5 intervertebral space will be&#xD;
      located. The skin overlying the intervertebral space after identification will be&#xD;
      anesthetized with 3 ml of 2% lidocaine using a size 22Gauge hypodermic needle. Lumbar&#xD;
      puncture will be performed using a 23 or 25Gauge pencil point spinal needle to inject the&#xD;
      study agent intrathecally. After testing the backflow of cerebrospinal fluid, the intrathecal&#xD;
      injectate will be given over approximately ten seconds. The spinal needle will then&#xD;
      withdrawn, and a light dressing will be placed over the puncture site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will remain in sitting position for atleast 10 minutes, then patients will be made&#xD;
      to lie supine. The level of sensory block will be determined using the hub of a sterile&#xD;
      22-gauge needle in the midline, and dermatomal level will be assessed every 2 min from&#xD;
      completion of injection until the assessed sensory level remained stable for four consecutive&#xD;
      assessments. Testing will be conducted every 10 min thereafter until two-segment regression&#xD;
      will be noticed. Further testing will be performed at 20 min intervals in the recovery room&#xD;
      until regression of 2 segments from peak sensory levels . Systolic blood pressure, diastolic&#xD;
      blood pressure and heart rate will be recorded every 3 min for the first 15 min following&#xD;
      spinal anaesthesia, and then every 5 min until the end of surgery. Hypotension (Systolic&#xD;
      blood-pressure &lt;90 mmHg or 30% decrease from the baseline) and bradycardia (Heart rate &lt;45&#xD;
      beats/min) will be treated with Intravenous bolus of phenylephrine 50 micrograms alliquots&#xD;
      and atropine 0.6 milligram, respectively. Adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting,&#xD;
      shivering, pruritus, respiratory depression, and transient neurological symptoms will be&#xD;
      recorded. The duration of surgery will be noted. The patients would be instructed to tell the&#xD;
      staff nurse whenever they felt the need for an analgesic. The staff nurse will note the time&#xD;
      to first analgesic request from the patient within 24 hours after surgery. Toradol&#xD;
      Intravenous 30 mg and paracetamol Intravenous 1gram would be the postoperative rescue&#xD;
      analgesics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistics: Statistical analysis will be done by SPSS 20. Demographic data will be expressed&#xD;
      as mean±SD. Mean time to Onset of sensory block, two segment regression of sensory block and&#xD;
      duration of analgesia between groups will be analysed by one way ANOVA. Haemodynamic measures&#xD;
      will be analysed by repeated measures ANOVA. Intergroup comparison of Level of sensory block&#xD;
      will be done by Mann Whitney U test. A p value &lt;0.05 will be taken as significant.&#xD;
