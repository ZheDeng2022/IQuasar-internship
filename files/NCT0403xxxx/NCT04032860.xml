  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In Asia, hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) commonly occurred in the underlying hepatitis B virus&#xD;
      (HBV)-related liver disease.Curative therapies could improve the prognosis of HCC patients.&#xD;
      However, tumor recurrence after curative therapy remains high with a 5-year recurrence rate&#xD;
      &gt;70%.The risk for HCC development is increased for patient with HBV infection，but there was&#xD;
      no consensus about which kind of oral antiviral treatment was the best option in the&#xD;
      prevention of HBV related HCC recurrence after curative treatment.Therefore, we conducted&#xD;
      this study to investigate the different effects of nucleotides(TDF) and nucleosides(ETV) on&#xD;
      the prognosis of HBV-related HCC after curative resection.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study was designed to compare the efficacy of ETV and TDF for patients with HBV-related&#xD;
      HCC patients undergoing curative liver resection. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in&#xD;
      a 1:1 ratio via computer-generated allocation to either the ETV group or TDF group. A block&#xD;
      size and strata were used in the randomization. In 2015, the American Association for the&#xD;
      Study of Liver (AASLD) adopted ETV and TDF as first-line antiviral treatments for chronic&#xD;
      hepatitis B. Patients in the ETV group received ETV tablets (RunZhong, CHIATAI TIANQING,&#xD;
      China) 0.5 mg/d orally starting from 2-4 weeks before surgery; those in the TDF group receive&#xD;
      TDF tablets(Viread, Aspen Port Elizabeth, China) 300 mg/d orally starting from 2-4 weeks&#xD;
      before surgery. Antiviral treatment was continued unless there was unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      withdrawal of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperatively, all patients underwent chest radiography and at least 2 dynamic imaging&#xD;
      examinations (contrast-enhanced ultrasound, contrast-enhanced computed tomography(CT) or&#xD;
      magnetic resonance imaging(MRI)). HBsAg and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg), HBV-DNA load,&#xD;
      anti-HCV, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcinoembryonic antigen(CEA), carbohydrate antigen&#xD;
      19-9(CA19-9), liver function and HBV genotypes were serologically examined within 1 week&#xD;
      before surgery. Additional serum samples were collected to test single-nucleotide&#xD;
      polymorphisms(SNPs) of the interleukin 28B(IL-28B) gene and serum levels of&#xD;
      interferon(IFN)-λ1, IFN-λ2, IFN-λ3, IL-1β, tumor necrosis factor alpha(TNF-α), IL-6, IL-8 and&#xD;
      IL-10. All serum and DNA samples were stored at -80°C until use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After general anesthesia, surgery was performed as the standard protocol. Intraoperative&#xD;
      ultrasonography was performed to assess the relationship of the tumor to vascular structures&#xD;
      and to eliminate the extrahepatic metastasis. Pringle's maneuver was applied to occlude the&#xD;
      blood inflow of the liver with cycles of 15 minutes clamp time and 5 minutes unclamped time.&#xD;
      Liver resection was carried out by the Cusa Excel Ultrasonic Surgical Aspirator System(CUSA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study, the primary outcome measures included both recurrence and overall survival&#xD;
      rates from the date of the operation. Secondary outcome measures included patient tolerance&#xD;
      of antiviral treatment, virologic response, liver function and additional cytokines such as&#xD;
      IFN-λ1 IFN-λ2, IFN-λ3, IL-1β, TNF-α, IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10. All the patients received&#xD;
      follow-up monitoring 1 month after the operation, every 3 months thereafter during the first&#xD;
      3 years, and then every 6 months in subsequent years. Physical examination, blood cell and&#xD;
      differential counts, renal and liver function tests, AFP levels, HBV serology and HBV-DNA&#xD;
      levels, serum IFN-λ level and imaging examinations were included in the follow-up&#xD;
      examinations when necessary. Follow-up was continued until August 2020 when all surviving&#xD;
      patients had a minimum follow-up of 24 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tumor recurrence was diagnosed based on the identification of a new lesion on at least 2&#xD;
      radiological examinations and increased AFP levels (&gt;100 ng/mL). Patients with tumor&#xD;
      recurrence were actively treated with salvage liver transplantation, repeat hepatic&#xD;
      resection, radiofrequency ablation, transcatheter arterial chemoembolization(TACE),&#xD;
      sorafenib, and/or chemotherapy, depending on the extent of the disease, the liver function,&#xD;
      and general condition of the patient.&#xD;
