    <textblock>
      The main aim of this study is to conduct a pretest-posttest RCT with a three-month follow-up&#xD;
      to investigate the sustainability of outcomes in students who use the Media Aware program.&#xD;
      Media Aware, a web-based media literacy education program for high school students to promote&#xD;
      sexual and relationship health. Media Aware is designed to provide high school students with&#xD;
      sexual health knowledge, media literacy skills, and the skills to make healthy decisions&#xD;
      about sexual activity. This study will examine if behavioral indicators among students in the&#xD;
      intervention group sustain, emerge, or diminish over time compared to students in the delayed&#xD;
      intervention group.&#xD;

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

Media Aware Sexual Health - High School: Media Aware is an online media literacy and sexual health education program developed for high school students that addresses the influence of media on sexual behaviors explicitly using established message processing theory. The program consists of 4 self-paced modules each with two to three lessons. Broadly, the modules cover healthy and unhealthy relationships, sexually transmitted infections, consent, substance use, pregnancy, protection and contraception, and communication between adolescents and their partners, parents, or health providers. Users also learn media literacy skills including message deconstruction to help examine the truth behind media messages.</description>

      <desc>Study risks were defined as discomfort with assessment procedures/content, or breach of confidentiality. Measures were taken to provide confidentiality with respect to questionnaire responses and program process data. To minimize the risk of discomfort for participants, participants could skip any question and quit participation at any time. Research staff scanned the incoming data on a regularly basis to record any concerns about any participants. No adverse events were reported.</desc>

    <limitations_and_caveats>The COVID-19 pandemic began during this trial, and primarily impacted the collection of follow-up data. Data collection procedures were revised to take into account social distancing measures and schools switching to remote learning. Response rates were lower and analyses revealed systematic differences between groups; therefore, data from these students were not included in the follow-up analyses.</limitations_and_caveats>
