  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a cross-sectional diagnostic accuracy study that includes both participants and&#xD;
      health worker participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant population will be recruited at clinics and through a household survey using&#xD;
      an enriched sample of a population with known G6PD status, established through previous&#xD;
      epidemiological studies. Clinic staff will take capillary blood samples and conduct two point&#xD;
      of care (POC) tests: 1) HemoCue® hemoglobin test, and 2) the investigational Standard&#xD;
      Diagnostics (SD) Biosensor STANDARD POC test for glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD)&#xD;
      deficiency. Venous blood will be collected and transferred to a laboratory where reference&#xD;
      assays will be performed on venous samples using the Pointe Scientific G6PD Analyzer and&#xD;
      hemoglobin tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The health worker participants will include trained intended users of the G6PD tests. Trained&#xD;
      health workers will be surveyed to assess product usability through a questionnaire to assess&#xD;
      label and packing comprehension as well as results interpretation.&#xD;

    <measure>Sensitivity of SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test for Identifying G6PD Deficient Individuals</measure>
    <time_frame>All samples were collected on study day 1</time_frame>
    <description>For the purposes of this study, an individual was considered G6PD deficient if they tested positive in the Pointe Scientific assay. A true positive was defined as a participant with ≤ 30% of normal G6PD activity in circulating venous blood determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;
Diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test is defined as the percentage of participants who tested positive for G6PD deficiency on the reference test who were identified by the test assay as positive, calculated as:&#xD;
Number of participants who were both test and true positive / (Number of participants who were test and true positive + Number of participants who were test negative but true positive [ie false negative]) * 100%.&#xD;
Sensitivity of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test was calculated from both venous and capillary blood samples.</description>

        <title>Sensitivity of SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test for Identifying G6PD Deficient Individuals</title>
        <description>For the purposes of this study, an individual was considered G6PD deficient if they tested positive in the Pointe Scientific assay. A true positive was defined as a participant with ≤ 30% of normal G6PD activity in circulating venous blood determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;
Diagnostic sensitivity of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test is defined as the percentage of participants who tested positive for G6PD deficiency on the reference test who were identified by the test assay as positive, calculated as:&#xD;
Number of participants who were both test and true positive / (Number of participants who were test and true positive + Number of participants who were test negative but true positive [ie false negative]) * 100%.&#xD;
Sensitivity of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test was calculated from both venous and capillary blood samples.</description>

        <title>Sensitivity of SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD Test for Identifying Women With Intermediate G6PD Activity</title>
        <description>To investigate the performance of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test to distinguish females with intermediate G6PD activity from females with normal activity, assay sensitivity was determined at a G6PD activity threshold of 70%. A true positive for intermediate G6PD activity in females was defined as G6PD activity between 30 and 70% of normal in circulating venous blood as determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;

        <description>For the purposes of this study, an individual was considered G6PD deficient if they tested positive by the Pointe Scientific assay. A true negative was defined as &gt; 30% of normal G6PD activity in circulating venous blood as determined by the Pointe Scientific test.&#xD;
Specificity is the percentage of participants who tested negative for G6PD deficiency on the reference test who were identified as negative using the test assay, calculated as:&#xD;
Number of participants who were both test and true negative / (Number of participants who were test and true negative + Number of participants who were test positive but true negative [ie false positive]) * 100%.&#xD;
Specificity of the SD Biosensor STANDARD G6PD test was calculated from both venous and capillary blood samples.</description>

        <description>After completing training, health worker participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their comprehension of the test label. The questionnaire consisted of 13 multiple-choice questions with mutually exclusive options and a single correct answer focused on aspects of the product label including key warnings, limitations, and restrictions as well as the proper test procedure.&#xD;
Acceptance (success) criterion for label comprehension was defined as at least 85% correct responses (11 out of 13 possible points).</description>

        <title>Number of Participants Who Met Acceptance Criteria for Accurate Results Interpretation</title>
        <description>After completing training, health worker participants were asked to complete a questionnaire to assess their ability to interpret the test result outputs. The questionnaire consisted of seven short-answer questions (5 valid results, 2 invalid results) focused on the participant's ability to read the results screen, record the simulated G6PD and hemoglobin quantitative results, and classify the results as normal, intermediate, deficient, or invalid.&#xD;
For each valid result, three points were possible: (one for G6PD result transcription, one for hemoglobin result transcription, and one for result interpretation) and for each invalid result, one point was possible, resulting in a total of 17 possible points.&#xD;
Acceptance (success) criterion for results interpretation was defined as at least 85% correct responses (15 out of 17 possible points).</description>
