  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lung cancer accounts for 30% of all cancers among American war Veterans and remains the&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer related deaths. Half of all lung cancers are metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a 2-year survival rate of 10%. Immunotherapy with immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy that aims to&#xD;
      harness the immune system to fight lung cancer. However, given the modest response rates of&#xD;
      20-25% to these immune checkpoint inhibitors, there is a greater desire to extend their&#xD;
      benefits to more patients. Along with the desire to extend their benefits, there is a&#xD;
      critical need for the development of novel approaches that can expand the benefit from immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors and create more durable responses, prolonging survival from lung&#xD;
      cancer. The investigators' studies show that extended dexamethasone (Dex) treatment induces&#xD;
      irreversible cell cycle blockade and a senescence phenotype through chronic activation of the&#xD;
      p27Kip1 gene in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) overexpressing lung adenocarcinoma (AC) cell&#xD;
      populations. Further, following withdrawal of Dexamethasone, proteins associated with the&#xD;
      senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP) strongly attracted and expanded T-cells, NK&#xD;
      cells and monocytes stimulated tumor cell cytolytic activity of NK cells. Therefore,&#xD;
      dexamethasone may induce a persistent senescence phenotype in tumor cell sub-populations&#xD;
      expressing moderate/high levels of GR and resultant chemokines produced by the senescent&#xD;
      cells will mobilize host immune cells to reboot response to immune checkpoint inhibitors&#xD;
      following complete Dexamethasone withdrawal.&#xD;

      Lung cancer accounts for 30% of all cancers among American war Veterans and remains the&#xD;
      leading cause of cancer related deaths. Half of all lung cancers are metastatic non-small&#xD;
      cell lung cancer (NSCLC), with a 2-year survival rate of 10%. Immunotherapy with immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy that aims to&#xD;
      harness the immune system to fight lung cancer. However, given the modest response rates of&#xD;
      20-25% to these immune checkpoint inhibitors, there is a greater desire to extend their&#xD;
      benefits to more patients. Along with the desire to extend their benefits, there is a&#xD;
      critical need for the development of novel approaches that can expand the benefit from immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors and create more durable responses, prolonging survival from lung&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our studies show that extended dexamethasone (Dex) treatment induces irreversible cell cycle&#xD;
      blockade and a senescence phenotype through chronic activation of the p27Kip1 gene in&#xD;
      glucocorticoid receptor (GR) overexpressing lung adenocarcinoma (AC) cell populations.&#xD;
      Further, following withdrawal of Dexamethasone, proteins associated with the senescence&#xD;
      associated secretory phenotype (SASP), particularly CCL2, CCL4, CXCL1 and CXCL2 strongly&#xD;
      attracted and expanded T-cells, NK cells and monocytes stimulated tumor cell cytolytic&#xD;
      activity of NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our overarching hypothesis is that in lung adenocarcinoma patients who are not on baseline&#xD;
      steroids, pre-treatment with Dexamethasone will induce a persistent senescence phenotype in&#xD;
      tumor cell sub-populations expressing moderate/high levels of GR and resultant chemokines&#xD;
      produced by the senescent cells will mobilize host immune cells to reboot response to immune&#xD;
      checkpoint inhibitors following complete Dexamethasone withdrawal. The investigators will&#xD;
      test this hypothesis through the conduct of the following aims.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: Use FLT-PET imaging and blood analysis to test whether a 7-14-day&#xD;
      pre-treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients with Dexamethasone followed by Dexamethasone&#xD;
      withdrawal will induce persistent senescence related cell cycle arrest in 1 lesion in 60% of&#xD;
      patients, (based on GR expression) accompanied by release of SASP proteins and activation of&#xD;
      T and NK cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Test whether a 7-14-day pre-treatment of lung adenocarcinoma patients with&#xD;
      Dexamethasone followed by Dexamethasone withdrawal and subsequent re-challenge with&#xD;
      pembrolizumab will yield an overall response rate (ORR) of 33% to pembrolizumab in&#xD;
      association with tumor GR status, SASP and immune cell activation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These aims will be conducted through a Phase II clinical trial designed as a single-arm&#xD;
      two-stage study in Veterans whose lung adenocarcinoma has progressed on immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors. Based on the investigators' preliminary data, the investigators expect that&#xD;
      Dexamethasone will induce tumor senescence in at least one lesion in 60% of patients and&#xD;
      secondarily improve overall response to pembrolizumab by 33%. Success with these aims would&#xD;
      inform a larger study that could potentially change the way the investigators approach&#xD;
      patients with primary or acquired resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors with an off the&#xD;
      shelf medication that could re-sensitize lung adenocarcinoma to immune checkpoint inhibitors.&#xD;
      The proposed research could substantially benefit Veterans with metastatic NSCLC, a group&#xD;
      with the most genomically complex lung cancers and poor survival.&#xD;

    <description>The primary objective in SA 2 is to assess the effect of Dex on pembrolizumab in terms of overall response rate (ORR). Based on pre-clinical and clinical studies, the investigators hypothesize that the true ORR of Dex followed by pembrolizumab will be at least 33% (i.e., p1 = 0.33) vs. the historical control whose ORR is at most 7% (i.e., p0 = 0.07). The ORR will be statistically evaluated when the FLT-PET response trial enters the third stage, where the number of patients with the selected optimal Dex duration will be 21. Otherwise, ORR will be summarized descriptively. The null hypothesis (p0 = 7%) will be rejected if five or more responses are observed in 21 patients, which yields a 1-sided type I error rate of 5% and power of 87% when the true ORR is 33% (i.e. p1 = 33%).</description>
