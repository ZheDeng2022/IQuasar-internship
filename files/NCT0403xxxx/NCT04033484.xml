  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Perineal wound healing is a significant challenge after extralevator abdominoperineal&#xD;
      excision (ELAPE) due to a high rate of wound breakdown. And it was proved that neoadjuvant&#xD;
      radiotherapy significantly increases perineal wound problems after abdominoperineal resection&#xD;
      for rectal cancer. Negative pressure therapy has proven benefits in open wounds, and recently&#xD;
      a negative pressure system has been developed for use on closed wounds at high risk of&#xD;
      breakdown. A systematic review suggested a significant decrease in perineal wound&#xD;
      complications when using incisional negative pressure wound therapy was demonstrated, with&#xD;
      surgical site infection rates as low as 9% (vs 41% in control groups). The review suggested&#xD;
      that incisional negative pressure wound therapy decreases perineal wound complications after&#xD;
      abdominoperineal resection. Prospective study also suggested that after ELAPE the application&#xD;
      of a negative pressure system to the perineal wound closed with biologic mesh may reduce&#xD;
      perineal wound complications. The aim of the present study was to determine whether negative&#xD;
      pressure therapy combined with biological mesh compared with biological mesh alone after&#xD;
      ELAPE could improve wound healing.&#xD;

    <description>The perineal wound was reconstructed with biologic mesh after ELAPE. The subcutaneous adipose layer was closed with 2/0 vicryl sutures, and a suction drain was left in the deep layer. The subcuticular layer and skin were closed with 3/0 vicryl mattress sutures and the negative pressure system applied at 80 mmHg</description>
