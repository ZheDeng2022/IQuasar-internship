      To evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of autologous γδT cells in the treatment of&#xD;
      advanced hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single-centre, non-randomised, open label, no control, prospective clinical trial.&#xD;
      The study will include the following sequential phases: sign informed consent, γδT cells&#xD;
      pre-culture, fresh biopsy and screening, apheresis, γδT cells preparation, treatment and&#xD;
      follow-up. The study will evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of autologous γδT&#xD;
      cells in patients with advanced hepatitis B related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) which are&#xD;
      refractory to current treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage I comprising a safety cohort of patients to identify a safe dose, Stage II comprising&#xD;
      an expanded patient group for response signal identification, Stage III to confirm efficacy&#xD;
      and safety.&#xD;
