  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the incremental effectiveness of a twice daily plant&#xD;
      sterol supplement in a population of South Asian patients who have low-to-moderate&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, we aim to measure the LDL-C reducing impact of regular plant sterol&#xD;
      supplementation added to a proven CVD reduction program for low-to-moderate risk South Asians&#xD;
      who do not meet guideline-based criteria (2018 ACC/AHA Lipid Guidelines) for medical lowering&#xD;
      of their LDL-C with an HMG CoA reductase inhibitor (statin) drug, and they are recommended to&#xD;
      improve their lipid-risk profile through diet and exercise primarily. In addition, patients&#xD;
      who may qualify for statin therapy, but are deemed to be intolerant of statins or who refuse&#xD;
      lipid lowering medication may also qualify.&#xD;

             laxative ≤2 teaspoons/d is allowed.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject is a female, who is pregnant, planning to be pregnant during the study period,&#xD;
