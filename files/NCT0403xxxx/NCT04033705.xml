  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will investigate if the HbA1c result before surgery which assesses glucose control&#xD;
      over the longer term, can accurately predict what happens to the glucose levels and glucose&#xD;
      profile following surgery. This will be recorded using continuous glucose monitoring sensors&#xD;
      which are worn by participants pre and post elective surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research question addressed in this study is how preoperative markers of diabetes control&#xD;
      correspond with the fluctuations in glucose levels which occur around surgery measured using&#xD;
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). At present a HbA1c blood test prior to surgery is&#xD;
      routinely used to infer the surgical risk associated with a person's glucose levels. HbA1c&#xD;
      gives a measure of average blood glucose levels over the preceding 2-3 months and the joint&#xD;
      British diabetes society guidelines recommend aiming for an HbA1c of 69mmol/mol or less&#xD;
      before planned surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However the HbA1c does not give a complete picture of a person's diabetes control and the&#xD;
      evidence behind this threshold is incomplete. Furthermore due to the physiological stress of&#xD;
      surgery and counterregulatory hormone release glucose levels can be more dynamic and&#xD;
      unpredictable in this population. With CGM glucose levels are recorded multiple times an&#xD;
      hour, revealing glucose variation and the amount of time the person's glucose levels spend&#xD;
      above and below the ideal range which is understood to be associated with increased risks.&#xD;
      This study aims to examine how such glucose patterns and 'at risk' time periods when glucose&#xD;
      levels are outside of the target range correspond with different levels of HbA1c before&#xD;
      surgery. This is an important area of study as diabetes is becoming increasingly prevalent in&#xD;
      surgical patients and is associated with worse outcomes. Using new technologies to evaluate&#xD;
      predictors of such harmful patterns in glucose levels is therefore vital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individuals who are eligible for this study are those with type 2 diabetes undergoing&#xD;
      elective primary hip or knee replacement surgery. This is an observational study.&#xD;
      Participants will wear a Freestyle Libre Pro glucose sensor for 2 weeks before and 2 weeks&#xD;
      immediately post their surgery. The investigators will also collect information about&#xD;
      participants recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Duration of the study will be up to 8 weeks. The study will take place at Portsmouth Hospital&#xD;
      NHS trust.&#xD;
