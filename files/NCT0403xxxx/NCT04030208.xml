    <textblock>
      Randomized, control crossover study comparing Umbulizer's efficacy to traditional mechanical&#xD;
      ventilators&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mechanical ventilators cost tens of thousands of dollars, rendering them difficult for low&#xD;
      and middle income countries to procure. Given chronic shortages of these devices in places&#xD;
      like Pakistan, patients are often ventilated manually with Ambu Bags for hours or days. This&#xD;
      method is not suitable for long term ventilation and is extremely life threatening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Umbulizer seeks to reduce preventable deaths due to ventilator scarcity by providing a&#xD;
      reliable alternative. The device is accurate, low-cost, and portable, and is an ideal&#xD;
      solution for treating patients with respiratory diseases in low-resource settings. The&#xD;
      primary objective of this study is to test efficacy and determine non-inferiority of this&#xD;
      device in comparison to ventilation provided by traditional ventilators. Secondary objectives&#xD;
      of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Testing safety of the device for use over a predetermined period of time&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluating patient comfort during ventilation with this device&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assessing ease of use of this device for doctors and medical staff&#xD;

    <description>If patient is randomly assigned to Sequence A, they will be placed on a traditional ventilator for the first period. This period will be 1 hour in duration. Delivered tidal volume, respiratory rate (RR), and peak pressure will be recorded throughout the period using the ventilator. Heart rate (HR), Blood Pressure (BP), and oxygen (O2) saturation measurements will be recorded every 5 minutes. Arterial blood gas (ABG) data will be taken at t = 1 hour if the patient is stable on the traditional ventilator. ABGs may be taken more frequently if the patient is destabilizing. Next, the study participant will be transitioned to the Umbulizer to begin Period 2. This period will also be 1 hour in duration. Delivered tidal volume, RR, and peak pressure will be recorded throughout the period using Umbulizer. HR, BP, O2 saturation measurements will be taken every 5 minutes. ABG data will be taken at t = 30 minutes and 1 hour.</description>
