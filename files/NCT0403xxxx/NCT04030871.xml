  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This document is a protocol for a human research study. This study is to be conducted&#xD;
      according to US and international standards of Good Clinical Practice (International&#xD;
      Conference on Harmonization ICHE6, R2), the Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 parts 803&#xD;
      and 812, and other applicable government regulations and Institutional research policies and&#xD;
      procedures. The purpose of the study is to compare the cost effectiveness and tolerability of&#xD;
      standard of care gastrostomy tubes to newer capsule dome gastrostomy tubes. The newer tubes&#xD;
      are significantly more expensive, therefore the aims of this study will be to determine&#xD;
      economic feasibility of going to the new model. Data are lacking on the newer g-tubes in&#xD;
      terms of longevity and cost-effectiveness&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastrostomy tubes are enteral feeding devices that are designed to provide delivery of&#xD;
      nutrients, fluids, medications directly into the stomach, bypassing the mouth and esophagus.&#xD;
      These devices are also known as gastrostomy tubes (G-tubes) or percutaneous endoscopic&#xD;
      gastrostomy tube (PEG tube). These are used when patients have conditions that make them&#xD;
      unable to swallow. While parenteral (Intravenous) nutrition and nasogastric tubes are also&#xD;
      nutritional-support methods. A variety of g-tube designs have been used in pediatric to adult&#xD;
      populations. The insertion of a g-tube is one of the most common endoscopic procedures and is&#xD;
      relatively safe. The OSU endoscopy lab placed 381 g-tubes in 2018.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most common G-tube used by the OSU Endoscopy Lab is the Balloon Bolus feeding tube. In&#xD;
      2017 the Capsule Dome G-Tube became commercially available. The cost of the Capsule dome&#xD;
      g-tube is twice as expensive as the standard balloon g-tube. The insertion costs would be&#xD;
      comparable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The need to perform a pilot comparative study of the two g-tubes is necessary to improve our&#xD;
      physicians understanding of the potential cost-effectiveness that longer patency we could&#xD;
      gather from the alternative device.&#xD;
