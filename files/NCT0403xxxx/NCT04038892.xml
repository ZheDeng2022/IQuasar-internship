  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bronchiectasis is defined as abnormal, chronic and permanent enlargement of one or more&#xD;
      bronchi. Disease symptoms; often productive cough, dyspnea, fatigue and wheezing. Changing&#xD;
      pulmonary mechanics, inadequate gas exchange, decreased muscle mass and associated&#xD;
      psychological problems may cause dyspnea, decreased exercise capacity and health-related&#xD;
      quality of life. Exercise training as a part of pulmonary rehabilitation is used to reduce&#xD;
      the severity of symptoms; is an effective treatment to improve exercise capacity and health&#xD;
      status. Virtual reality based exercise training has taken its place in many areas of&#xD;
      rehabilitation as a current and new approach. In the studies in the literature, Nintendo Wii&#xD;
      Fit games are an effective, motivating, entertaining and clinically useful method for&#xD;
      reducing symptoms in the rehabilitation of chronic lung diseases. Wii Fit games generally&#xD;
      include strengthening, aerobics and balance exercises. Developed by BreathingLabs, Breathing&#xD;
      Games, which is based on breathing exercises, are a new product, a virtual reality&#xD;
      application that has been included in a limited number of studies, has shown its effect on&#xD;
      reducing respiratory problems and is open to research effects for many patient groups. The&#xD;
      importance of this study is that it will be the first study on Nintendo Wii Fit games based&#xD;
      exercise training and Breathing Games based breathing exercises training in children with&#xD;
      bronchiectasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to investigate the effect of different virtual reality-based&#xD;
      exercise trainings on pulmonary function, respiratory and peripheral muscle strength,&#xD;
      functional capacity and balance in children with bronchiectasis.&#xD;
