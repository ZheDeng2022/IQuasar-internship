      assessment of bacterial reduction and post-operative pain following Laser activated&#xD;
      irrigation using sodium hypochlorite and a 980 nm diode laser device as an adjunct to&#xD;
      conventional root canal treatment, and comparing it with passive ultrasonic irrigation using&#xD;
      sodium hypochlorite and an ultrasonic device in patients with single rooted asymptomatic&#xD;
      necrotic teeth.&#xD;

      After thorough diagnosis and recording of the patient's perceived preoperative pain using the&#xD;
      numeric rating scale (NRS), which should be zero. Patients with single rooted necrotic teeth&#xD;
      will be randomly divided into two groups for endodontic treatment in a single visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group LAI (in which laser activated irrigation will be done) and group PUI (in which passive&#xD;
      ultrasonic irrigation will be done).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The teeth are anesthetized and isolation is done. the clamp, tooth crown and rubber dam are&#xD;
      disinfected using 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and 30% hydrogen peroxide then sodium thiosulphate&#xD;
      to neutralize their effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of caries and defective restorations is done, followed by access cavity preparation&#xD;
      using round burs and fine tapered stones. then the first microbiological sample is taken&#xD;
      using paper points. Afterwards root canal preparation is done using Protaper Next files and&#xD;
      irrigation is done using 2.5% sodium hypochlorite and a 30 -gauge side vented needle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After chemomechanical preparation of the canal, the second microbiological sample is taken,&#xD;
      afterwards the canals are filled with sodium hypochlorite and according to the group, the&#xD;
      following is done:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group LAI: the 200 micrometer fibre of the diode laser device enters the root canal and&#xD;
      the device is activated at a setting of 980 nm and 1.5 Watts for 5 seconds, repeated 4 times&#xD;
      with a 10 seconds gap in between.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In group PUI: the ultrasonic device is activated inside the canal using a passive non cutting&#xD;
      tip and kept activated for 1 minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Then, irrigation with saline solution is done then the third microbiological sample is taken,&#xD;
      afterwards obturation is done and temporization. the patient is referred to the restorative&#xD;
      dentistry clinic to complete the restoration of his tooth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient is instructed to record his pain at 6,12,24 and 48 hours postoperatively and the&#xD;
      microbiological samples are analyzed&#xD;

    <description>bacterial cultures made from microbiological samples taken at different stages of the endodontic treatment. The bacteria will be counted as colony forming units (CFUs). There are three samples that are taken during the endodontic treatment : S1: After Access cavity preparation. S2: After chemomechanical preparation S3: After using the intervention or control. The CFUs will be counted in the culture obtained from each sample then a comparison will be made between the intervention and control groups regarding the difference in the number of CFUs in S2 between S3</description>
