      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Three-fourths of people diagnosed with gastric cancer will die from it. Researchers want to&#xD;
      see if giving cancer drugs in a new way can help people live longer and delay the time it&#xD;
      takes for the cancer to grow.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a better way to treat advanced stomach cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with stomach cancer that has spread throughout their belly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood, urine, and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
      Scans&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cancer sample: If they do not have one, they will have a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tests of performance of normal activities&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary assessment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a laparoscopy. Small cuts are made into their abdomen. A thin camera&#xD;
      with a light is inserted. Small instruments are used to take biopsies. This will be repeated&#xD;
      during the study to monitor the cancer. During the first laparoscopy, a port with a catheter&#xD;
      attached will be put into the abdomen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants may also have an endoscopy: A thin tube with a camera is inserted through the&#xD;
      mouth and into the stomach. The tube collects samples to monitor the cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get paclitaxel every 3 weeks through the abdominal port and through a small&#xD;
      plastic tube in an arm vein. They will also take capecitabine by mouth twice daily for the&#xD;
      first 15 days of a 21-day cycle.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After participants finish 3 cycles, they will have scans to see how they are doing. They may&#xD;
      get another course of therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have visits every 3 weeks during treatment. Then they will have follow-up&#xD;
      visits for 5 years. Then they will keep in touch with researchers for the rest of their life.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An estimated 28,000 cases of gastric adenocarcinoma are diagnosed annually in the U.S.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Peritoneal metastasis is a common finding at diagnosis, making curative surgical&#xD;
           resection possible in an estimated 25% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Systemic chemotherapy is the recommended treatment for patients with metastatic gastric&#xD;
           cancer to the peritoneal cavity, however selective use of cytoreductive surgery and&#xD;
           intraperitoneal chemotherapy has been associated with improved overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Multiple chemotherapeutic agents and delivery systems have been described for&#xD;
           intraperitoneal therapy, but no standard regimen exists.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Determine the intraperitoneal progression free survival (iPFS) in patients with peritoneal&#xD;
      metastases from gastric cancer after repeated intraperitoneal chemotherapeutic infusion (IPC)&#xD;
      and systemic paclitaxel administration with concomitant capecitabine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed adenocarcinoma of the stomach.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Radiographic evidence of peritoneal carcinomatosis and/or sub-radiographic evidence of&#xD;
           peritoneal carcinomatosis found at staging laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medically fit for systemic chemotherapy and intraperitoneal chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Men and women age greater than or equal to 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Phase II, nonrandomized, open label study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients will enroll in two cohorts: those with prior systemic chemotherapy and those&#xD;
           who are treatment naive.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patients undergo staging laparoscopy and placement of peritoneal access port.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intraperitoneal paclitaxel (60 mg/m^2 weekly), intravenous paclitaxel (80 mg/m2 weekly),&#xD;
           and capecitabine (825 mg/m^2 twice daily for 14 days of each cycle) for 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Treatment response will be assessed with imaging and laparoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  It is expected that 16-20 patients per year for total 4 years will be enrolled. The&#xD;
           accrual ceiling is set at 74 patients.&#xD;

             intralumenal heparin) for venous or arterial access devices is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Pregnant women are excluded because paclitaxel and capecitabine can cause fetal harm&#xD;
             when administered to pregnant women. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
