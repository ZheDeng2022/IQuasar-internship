  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is an open-label trial of 20 study participants with glaucoma or ocular hypertension.&#xD;
      Participants with qualifying study eye(s) after screening and baseline evaluations will&#xD;
      receive the Balance Goggles System. After a baseline evaluation (prior to negative pressure&#xD;
      application through the BGS), study eyes will be treated for one hour in the clinic and be&#xD;
      evaluated again. They will then use the BGS for the next 3-6 weeks and be evaluated again.&#xD;
      The goal is to determine whether the intraocular pressure (IOP)-lowering effects of BGS is&#xD;
      accompanied by changes in retinal thickness measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT),&#xD;
      retinal vascular density measured by OCT-angiography, or retinal fluorescence measured by a&#xD;
      fundus camera.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Participant must be medically able to undergo the testing required in the schedule of&#xD;
             events (SOE).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Participant's clinical diagnosis must be consistent with glaucoma characterized by&#xD;
             clinical evidence of progressive retinal ganglion cell dysfunction and degeneration&#xD;
             using at least one visual field and at least one structural modality, OR with ocular&#xD;
             hypertension with intraocular pressure above 21 mm Hg.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If a participant has two eyes meeting study criteria, both may be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with orbital anatomy that permits a proper seal in both eyes when goggles are&#xD;
             placed over eyes and can tolerate measurements with goggles in place&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participant must understand and sign the informed consent. If the participant's vision&#xD;
             is impaired to the point where he/she cannot read the informed consent document, the&#xD;
             document will be read to the participant in its entirety.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with a history of allergy to primary study device material (i.e., silicone)&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subjects with a history of any ocular disorder or condition (e.g., corneal transplant)&#xD;
             in either eye that would likely interfere with the interpretation of the study results&#xD;
             or compromise subject safety&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subjects with a prior retinal detachment, active retinal detachment, an untreated&#xD;
             retinal detachment, unresolved cystoid macular edema, or any other fundus findings&#xD;
             that may prevent visualization of the retina in either eye; subjects with macular&#xD;
             degeneration are not excluded from participation in the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subjects with a history of prior penetrating glaucoma surgery (e.g. trabeculectomy,&#xD;
             tube shunt, etc.) in either eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subjects with narrow anterior chamber angle anatomy in either eye as visualized by&#xD;
             gonioscopy with a Shaffer angle grade of â‰¤ 2 in any of the four quadrants&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subjects with eyelid edema, festoons or excessive skin laxity in either eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subjects with conjunctival chemosis in either eye&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subjects with best corrected visual acuity of 20/200 or worse in either eye due to&#xD;
             glaucoma&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Subjects who have had intraocular surgery in the study eye within 12 weeks prior to&#xD;
             the screening visit , or who, in the opinion of the investigator, may require any&#xD;
             ocular surgery (e.g., cataract extraction or glaucoma procedure) in either eye during&#xD;
             the course of the study&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Subjects who do not wish to or cannot comply with study procedures, including home use&#xD;
             of the study device&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Subjects with any physical or mental condition that would, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, increase the risk of participation in the study or may interfere with&#xD;
             the study procedures, evaluations and outcome assessments&#xD;
