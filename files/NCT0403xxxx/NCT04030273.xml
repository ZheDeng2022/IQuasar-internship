  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Uterine fibroids are the most common benign tumors of the genital organs of women of&#xD;
      childbearing age. Literature data show that more than 75% of women have fibroids.Symptomatic&#xD;
      fibroids account for approximately over 200,000 hysterectomies and 50,000 myomectomies&#xD;
      annually in the United States. Fibroids have a major impact on fertility, with significant&#xD;
      adverse effect on implantation rate and spontaneous abortion rates when compared with&#xD;
      infertile women without fibroids. The definitive treatment for uterine fibroids in a fertile&#xD;
      patient is surgical excision. Although usually effective, myomectomy is not a risk-free&#xD;
      operation, since the surgical procedure can cause mechanical infertility and can be&#xD;
      associated with infection, injury to adjacent tissues, hemorrhage and need to convert to&#xD;
      hysterectomy. A not often mentioned consequence of myomectomy is post-operative intrauterine&#xD;
      adhesion formation. It has been reported that 50% of women undergoing open myomectomy are&#xD;
      found to have intrauterine adhesions diagnosed by hysteroscopy performed 3 months after&#xD;
      surgery. Such a high prevalence of intrauterine adhesions after open myomectomy is&#xD;
      unexpected, however only few studies have addressed this topic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is accepted that injury to the endometrium is generally considered to be the primary&#xD;
      causative factor for the development of intrauterine adhesions. The reason for such a high&#xD;
      incidence of intrauterine adhesions after open myomectomy is unclear. It is speculated that&#xD;
      infection or in adverted closure of the uterine cavity may play a role in intrauterine&#xD;
      adhesion formation. The relationship between the number of fibroids removed and the risk of&#xD;
      adhesions suggests a traumatic etiology. In the preservation of the uterus for the purpose of&#xD;
      fertility, it is essential to also understand the impact of myomectomy on the endometrium.&#xD;
      Currently no guideline recommends in office hysteroscopy as follow-up after myomectomy. The&#xD;
      purpose of the present study is to evaluate the frequency of uterine adhesions following&#xD;
      myomectomy and the impact of number, size and location of the fibroids as well as&#xD;
      intraoperative breach of the endometrial cavity at the time of the myomectomy.&#xD;
