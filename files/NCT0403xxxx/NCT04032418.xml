  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well pembrolizumab given every 12 weeks works compared to&#xD;
      every 3 weeks in treating patients with non-small cell lung cancer. Immunotherapy with&#xD;
      monoclonal antibodies, such as pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the&#xD;
      cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving&#xD;
      pembrolizumab every 12 weeks may provide similar disease control with fewer treatments for&#xD;
      patients with non-small cell lung cancer when compared to every 3 weeks. Demonstrating that&#xD;
      12 week dosing is as effective as 3 week dosing may also have a significant impact when&#xD;
      considering the cost required for these medications.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the 1-year progression-free survival rate with 200mg pembrolizumab&#xD;
      administered every 3 weeks compared to 200mg pembrolizumab administered every 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess overall survival between the two treatment groups. II. To assess the serious&#xD;
      adverse event profiles between the two treatment groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate circulating biomarkers of treatment response and resistance. II. To&#xD;
      characterize fecal microbiotic profile and to correlate those results with tumor&#xD;
      characteristics and antitumor immune responses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive pembrolizumab intravenously (IV) over 30 minutes every 3 weeks for up&#xD;
      to 24 months in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive pembrolizumab IV over 30 minutes every 12 weeks for up to 24 months&#xD;
      in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days, and then every 12&#xD;
      weeks for at least 12 months.&#xD;
