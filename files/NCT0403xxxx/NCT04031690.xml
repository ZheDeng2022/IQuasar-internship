  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a chronic, disabling disease characterized by a&#xD;
      progressive and irreversible deterioration in respiratory function, resulting in impaired&#xD;
      quality of life (QoL) and patient dependence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The factors involved in the alteration of QoL in these patients are the physical symptoms&#xD;
      related to fibrosis (dyspnea, cough, fatigue) and psychological symptoms (anxiety and&#xD;
      depression) as well as social, relational and financial factors, the experience of the&#xD;
      disease and disability, the time required for diagnosis, the information received, and the&#xD;
      initiation of a treatment such as oxygen therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Caregivers primarily in chronic diseases (so-called natural or informal caregivers) provide&#xD;
      partial or total assistance to a dependent person for activities of daily living for care,&#xD;
      social support and maintenance of autonomy, administrative procedures, psychological support,&#xD;
      communication, domestic activities or even financial assistance, often despite their own&#xD;
      exhaustion and health issues.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies on the QoL of patient-caregiver dyads in IPF through semi-structured&#xD;
      interviews highlight the role of previously identified factors in caregivers as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators want to confirm the data obtained in a large population of patients and their&#xD;
      caregivers in order to evaluate the QoL of caregivers and confirm the impact of its various&#xD;
      factors on it in order to suggest ways to improve the lives of both the caregiver and the&#xD;
      patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of investigators' work is that the QoL of caregivers of patients with IPF is&#xD;
      altered, particularly by the patient's functional symptoms (cough, dyspnea, fatigue, anxiety&#xD;
      and depression), the arrival of oxygen therapy in the home and the caregiver's social&#xD;
      isolation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators believe that there are links and interactions between the caregiver's and&#xD;
      patient's quality of life and therefore have an impact on the patient's care.&#xD;
