      DISCOVER CKD is an international observational cohort study in patients with CKD, comprising&#xD;
      both prospective and retrospective patient cohorts. The study does not attempt to test any&#xD;
      specific a priori hypotheses, is largely descriptive, and utilises data collected only under&#xD;
      conditions of routine clinical care.&#xD;

      DISCOVER CKD is an international observational cohort study in CKD patients, comprising both&#xD;
      prospective and retrospective patient cohorts. The study does not attempt to test any&#xD;
      specific a priori hypotheses, is largely descriptive, and utilises data collected only under&#xD;
      conditions of routine clinical care. No additional invasive clinical tests or procedures are&#xD;
      mandated per study protocol, and all data collected/extracted is based solely on observations&#xD;
      of disease management and treatment decisions made between the treating physicians and their&#xD;
      patients, and is not intended to be interventional in anyway. Patients will not receive any&#xD;
      experimental intervention or experimental treatment as a result of participating in this&#xD;
      study. Analyses will be conducted separately for prospective and retrospective CKD cohorts&#xD;
      (via interim reports), and then in aggregate by combining prospective and retrospective data,&#xD;
      to the extent possible, at the end of the study.&#xD;

    <arm_group_label>Retrospective CKD cohort</arm_group_label>
    <description>Retrospective (secondary) data refers to patient data extracted from existing electronic health records (EHRs)/registries/databases. It represents existing real-world data, regardless of reason for collection or location of storage and is analogous to those represented in the study protocol for which feasibility assessments are conducted. Retrospective data will be collected from registries, databases, and EHRs. The aim is to identify and extract clinical data retrospectively from a minimum of 100000 (no set maximum) CKD patients via existing databases/registries/EHRs across geographies. The retrospective data will be captured beginning 1 January 2008 through the most currently available data.</description>

  <arm_group>
    <arm_group_label>Prospective CKD cohort</arm_group_label>
    <description>Prospective (primary and secondary) data refers to manual collection/extraction of data in a de novo manner for the purpose of addressing study objectives. Collection/extraction of patient data in the prospective cohort will be done via electronic case report form, questionnaires, and mobile phone/tablet application. The initial aim is to identify and collect/extract data from approximately 1000 (no set maximum) enrolled CKD patients until the decision to stop the study is taken, with the possibility of prospective follow-up for a minimum of approximately 1 year up to a maximum of approximately 3 years. The patient specific data in the prospective cohort will be collected by utilizing Rapid Assessment of Physical Activity (RAPA) questionnaire, Work Productivity and Activity Impairment (WPAI) questionnaire, Short Form (SF)-36 questionnaires, simple food diary, and other patient reported outcomes - including a set of questions to collect patient symptoms.</description>
