  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Over 50% of the more than 270,000 childhood cancer survivors in the U.S. have been treated&#xD;
      with anthracyclines and thus are at risk of developing cardiotoxicity. The impact of exercise&#xD;
      training on LV structure has been extensively studied. Left ventricular hypertrophy and&#xD;
      cardiac chamber enlargement with the accompanying ability to generate a large stroke volume&#xD;
      are direct results of exercise training. Aerobic exercise therapy offers a&#xD;
      non-pharmacological mechanism to modulate multiple gene expression pathways that may promote&#xD;
      cardiac remodeling. No prior studies have investigated the efficacy of aerobic exercise in&#xD;
      the prevention or treatment of anthracycline-induced cardiotoxicity. We hypothesize that&#xD;
      exercise intervention leads to a reverse in adverse cardiac remodeling with improvement of&#xD;
      global and regional myocardial function in patients exposed to anthracycline.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research is to assess the effect of exercise intervention on imaging&#xD;
      parameters by CMR, cardiopulmonary indices and MicroRNA expression in survivors of childhood&#xD;
      cancer exposed to anthracycline therapy. Thus, results from this study could provide a&#xD;
      foundation for a paradigm shift in our approach to the prevention and management of&#xD;
      anthracycline induced cardiotoxicity in this population. Patients who have been exposed to&#xD;
      anthracycline treatment and who are greater than 9 years of age will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will come into the clinic for 7 study visits. Patients will have an exercise&#xD;
      intervention provided to them by a trainer at the designated YMCA. Patients will start their&#xD;
      exercise for 15 minutes per day for 3-5 days a week for week one progressing to 45 minutes&#xD;
      per day, 3 - 5 days a week as tolerated by the end of week four. The goal during each session&#xD;
      is for the patient to exercise at 50-80% of their age adjusted maximum heart rate, which will&#xD;
      be determined by the personal trainer (PT) at their initial visit. The exercise program will&#xD;
      continue for 12 weeks (ending at 16 weeks after entry to the study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinic patients will have the following tests completed:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 0 and Week 16: Cardiac MRI, stress test along with blood samples and Karnofsky/Lansky&#xD;
      Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 0 patients receive a Fitbit and home diary/Wellness Log for completion. Week 4 began&#xD;
      exercise intervention Weeks 0, 4, 8, 16 and 20 patients will receive phone calls for symptom&#xD;
      tracker Weeks 0, 16, and 6 month f/u patients complete a questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also have Fitness assessments to see how their exercise intervention is doing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1: To measure the impact of the toolbox exercise intervention on cardiac&#xD;
      remodeling as measured by cardiac magnetic resonance Imaging (CMR) in childhood cancer&#xD;
      survivors exposed to Anthracycline therapy. The objective of this Aim is to use CMR to&#xD;
      characterize changes of myocardial mass, volume, global and regional myocardial function at&#xD;
      baseline and following exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2a: To examine the impact of the toolbox exercise intervention on exercise&#xD;
      testing derived cardiopulmonary parameters in childhood cancer survivors exposed to&#xD;
      Anthracycline therapy. The objective of this aim is to assess changes in oxygen consumption&#xD;
      (peak VO2), VO2 @ anaerobic threshold, O2 pulse, and he ventilation/carbon dioxide slope&#xD;
      (VE/VCO2slope) at baseline and following exercise intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2b: To examine the impact of the toolbox exercise intervention on quality of&#xD;
      life, functional status and fitness in childhood cancer survivors exposed to anthracycline&#xD;
      therapy. his Aim will test the hypothesis that exercise intervention will result in&#xD;
      improvement in:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quality of life as measured by PedsQL 4.0 for children â‰¤ 18 and the SF-36 for adults &gt;&#xD;
           18&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patient functional status as measured by the Karnofsky/Lansky Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fitness as measured by range of motion, balance, endurance, body composition and and&#xD;
           functional strength&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3: Analyze serum microRNA (miRNA) expression focusing on cardiac stress&#xD;
      signaling pathways at three time points during each stress test: at baseline (prior to stress&#xD;
      testing), immediately post-exercise (within 1min of completion of exercise testing), and&#xD;
      after 1 hour of rest following stress testing). The objective of this aim is to measure&#xD;
      changes in microRNA expression in plasma related to stress signaling pathways after exercise&#xD;
      intervention when compared to baseline&#xD;
