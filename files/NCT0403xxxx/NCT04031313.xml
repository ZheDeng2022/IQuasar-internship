      Background: The current study will prospectively follow-up on chronic pain patients treated&#xD;
      with oil extracts of medical cannabis (MC) for a period of six months in &quot;real life&quot;&#xD;
      conditions. This study will enable a deep investigation regarding the effects of the active&#xD;
      extract of cannabis inflorescence formulated in oil, derived from the cannabis plant. The&#xD;
      results may allow us to reduce the gap in understanding MC's effects on pain relief and its&#xD;
      safety, to identify predictors for treatment success/ failure, as well as to enable us&#xD;
      tailoring a personalize MC treatment by choosing optimal concentration and dose according to&#xD;
      the patient needs. We hypothesize that following the treatment with oil extracts of MC for&#xD;
      chronic pain, associations will be found between its effectiveness and the types of clinical&#xD;
      pain, personality traits and demographic characteristics. We also do not expect serious (life&#xD;
      threatening) adverse events to be reported. Methods: This study has been already approved by&#xD;
      the ethics committee of Haifa University (approval number 216/19). The sample will include a&#xD;
      prospective cohort of 600 patients with chronic non-cancer pain that will request license to&#xD;
      use oil extracts MC. The patients who will be approved to receive a license will be&#xD;
      followed-up longitudinally for a period of six months from the signing of the consent form.&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to fill a variety of questionnaires that may indicate the outcome&#xD;
      of the treatment. The follow-up will take place in four time points: at the time of approval&#xD;
      of the license (before starting the treatment, baseline), as well as at one, three, and six&#xD;
      months from the initiation of treatment. Data will be collected by a web based data&#xD;
      collection technology (Qualtrics®). In cases which there are a need for it, the information&#xD;
      will be gathered by phone or face to face meetings.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The use of medical cannabis (MC) for the treatment of chronic pain has risen in the last&#xD;
      decade. According to the Israel Medical Cannabis Unit (IMCU) of the Israeli Ministry of&#xD;
      Health (IMOH), there are currently several tens of thousands licenses for the use of medical&#xD;
      cannabis in Israel, mostly for the relief of chronic pain (mainly utilized by smoking and&#xD;
      inhalation). It is estimated that 2,000 new licenses will be issued yearly. Recently, the&#xD;
      IMOH approved the use of drops of whole extract of cannabis inflorescence formulated in oil,&#xD;
      intended for sublingual administration, for the treatment of chronic pain. That far, there is&#xD;
      a distinct lack of evidence about the efficacy and safety of MC treatment in the long-term&#xD;
      with relatively few prospective randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining this issue.&#xD;
      This can be explained, at least partially, by the reluctance of physicians, researchers and&#xD;
      pharmaceutical companies to engage in MC research for various reasons (mainly when utilized&#xD;
      by smoking and inhalation). Such reasons include the following facts: MC is classified as a&#xD;
      schedule I drug by the American Food and Drug Administration (FDA); MC is often smoked; that&#xD;
      the level of cannabinoids and terpenes can vary between suppliers and even from the same&#xD;
      supplier and therefore it is difficult to quantify the dose; there is abuse of MC;&#xD;
      patentability of a natural compounds is problematic; and MC consumption is stigmatized. One&#xD;
      of the accepted ways to narrow gaps of information in medical research where there is a&#xD;
      dearth of RCTs is to develop cohorts that may allow for the prospective, structured data&#xD;
      collection and data mining of a large number of &quot;real life&quot; patient conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will prospectively follow-up on chronic pain patients treated with oil&#xD;
      extracts MC for a period of six months in &quot;real life&quot; conditions. This study will enable a&#xD;
      deep investigation regarding the effects of the active extract of cannabis inflorescence&#xD;
      formulated in oil, derived from the cannabis plant. The results may allow us to reduce the&#xD;
      gap in understanding MC's effects on pain reduction and its safety, to identify predictors&#xD;
      for treatment success/ failure, as well as to enable us tailoring a personalize MC treatment&#xD;
      by choosing optimal concentration and dose according to the patient needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The sample will include a prospective cohort of patients with chronic non-cancer&#xD;
      pain that will request license to use oil extracts medical cannabis. The estimated sample&#xD;
      size is 600 patients. The patients who will be approved to receive a license will be&#xD;
      followed-up longitudinally for a period of six months from the signing of the consent form.&#xD;
      The patients will be recruited by their physicians in their clinics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria - Patients that will be recommended to use oil extracts medical cannabis&#xD;
      for the treatment of all forms of chronic pain (despite cancer); Patients above the age of 18&#xD;
      years; Patients who will sign an informed consent after receiving explanation on the&#xD;
      requirements, duration and nature of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria - Patients who lack the ability to understand the purpose and instructions&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires - (1) Demographic questionnaire includes data regarding age, gender, marital&#xD;
      status, country of origin, religion, weight, height, smoking habitats, and pain etiology; (2)&#xD;
      Co-morbidities; (3) Expectations from cannabis treatment; (4) Information regarding the oil&#xD;
      extracts as: type of the oil, concentration, dose, effect, etc. (5) Patient satisfaction from&#xD;
      the treatment and the information they will be receive; (6) Pain - The short-form McGill Pain&#xD;
      Questionnaire (SF-MPQ), Pain Disability Index (PDI), Pain treatment and other pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments; (7) Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI); (8) Beck Depression Inventory&#xD;
      (BDI-II); (9) Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS); (10) General Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7); (11)&#xD;
      Quality of life (EQ5); (12) Changes in appetite; (13) Adverse events - occurrence, severity;&#xD;
      (14) Cognitive status - by a telephone interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedure - The study has been approved by the ethics committee of Haifa University&#xD;
      (approval number 216/19). Participants will be recruited by physicians either with pain&#xD;
      management expertise or those who have license to offer MC. Potential patients who will meet&#xD;
      the inclusion criteria, will get a full explanation about the study aims and procedure.&#xD;
      Following their agreement to participate in the study they will sign a written informed&#xD;
      consent that will be sent to the investigator along with the patient's diagnosis and contact&#xD;
      information. Then, the patients will be contacted by the investigator and will be asked to&#xD;
      complete the questionnaires at each of the following time-points: at the time of approval of&#xD;
      the license (before starting the treatment, baseline) a month, three months and six months,&#xD;
      from the initiation of treatment. Data will be collected by a secured web based data&#xD;
      collection technology (Qualtrics®). In case of difficulties in using that technology, the&#xD;
      data will be collected via phone or face to face meetings. Notably, this study is only&#xD;
      observational and not interventional, e.g., the patient will be informed that participation&#xD;
      in this study will not influence the approval\disapproval for the acceptance\renewal of the&#xD;
      oil extract medical cannabis license from the Medical Cannabis Unit (MCU) of the Israeli&#xD;
      health ministry. Additionally, the research related tie between patients to their physician&#xD;
      will be terminated following the signing of the consent form, from this point forward, the&#xD;
      physician will have no access to the specific patients' study related data. This is in&#xD;
      purpose to assure that decisions regarding the patient's further treatments will not be&#xD;
      influenced by any way from the collected data.&#xD;
