    <textblock>
      Study CC-99712-MM-001 is an open-label, Phase 1, dose escalation (Part A) and expansion (Part&#xD;
      B), First-in-Human (FIH) clinical study of CC-99712 in monotherapy or combination in&#xD;
      participants with relapsed and refractory multiple myeloma (MM). The dose escalation part&#xD;
      (Part A) of the study will evaluate the safety and tolerability of escalating doses of&#xD;
      CC-99712, administered intravenously (IV) in monotherapy (Arm 1) or combination (Arm 2), to&#xD;
      determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of CC-99712 guided by a Bayesian logistic&#xD;
      regression model (BLRM). A modified accelerated titration design will also be used for Arm 1&#xD;
      and Arm 2. The MTD may be established separately for CC-99712 administered at Q3W and/ or Q4W&#xD;
      schedules. The expansion part (Part B) will further evaluate the safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      CC-99712 in monotherapy (Arm 1) or combination (Arm 2) administered at or below the MTD in&#xD;
      selected expansion cohorts in order to determine the RP2D. One or more doses or dosing&#xD;
      regimens may be selected for cohort expansion. All participants will be treated until&#xD;
      confirmed disease progression per IMWG criteria, unacceptable toxicity, or&#xD;
      participants//Investigator decision to withdraw.&#xD;

                       is performed within the prior 72 hours). A serum or urine pregnancy test&#xD;
                       (investigators discretion) must also be performed at the end of study for&#xD;
