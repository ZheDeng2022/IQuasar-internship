  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is investigating the value of an imaging study of the brain called an MRI&#xD;
      (which stands for magnetic resonance imaging), utilized in unique way, to delineate whether&#xD;
      the tumor has recurred or whether radiation changes have occurred after a brain metastasis&#xD;
      treated with focused radiation has enlarged.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This research study is a Phase II clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this research study, the investigators are utilizing MRIs of the brain with additional&#xD;
      post-imaging processing (called Treatment Response Assessment Maps or TRAMs) to try to&#xD;
      delineate tumor recurrence from radiation changes. The investigators hope to understand&#xD;
      whether such a test may allow future patients to avoid resection entirely.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have a histologically or cytologically confirmed solid malignancy of&#xD;
             extracranial origin and radiographic evidence of at least one brain metastasis for&#xD;
             which stereotactic radiation was utilized in the past. Patients with intracranial&#xD;
             pathologic confirmation of a malignancy which originated extracranially but for which&#xD;
             extracranial disease has not been biopsied are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must have an enlarging lesion in the brain at least 4 months after prior&#xD;
             stereotactic radiation to the same site for which neurosurgical resection is planned&#xD;
             as routine standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be age 18 years or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must be willing to undergo study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The effects of gadolinium / other MRI-based contrast agents on the developing human&#xD;
             fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential and men must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control;&#xD;
             abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Should a&#xD;
             woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she is participating in this&#xD;
             study, she should inform her treating physician immediately.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants must possess the ability to understand and the willingness to sign a&#xD;
             written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have a contraindication to MRI (e.g. non compatible implanted&#xD;
             metallic device for which MRI is absolutely contraindicated).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants who have chronic kidney disease stage IV-V or end stage renal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with a history of anaphylactic reactions to gadolinium.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because gadolinium-based agents have not&#xD;
             been proven to be safe to administer to a developing fetus. Similarly, breastfeeding&#xD;
             women will be excluded from this study.&#xD;
