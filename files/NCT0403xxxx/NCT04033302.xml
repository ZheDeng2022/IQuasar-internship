      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of CAR T&#xD;
      cell therapy against CD7-positive hematological malignancies using CD7 specific CAR T cells.&#xD;
      The study also aims to learn more about the function of CD7 CAR T cells and their persistence&#xD;
      in patients of hematological malignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hematological malignancies including T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL), T cell&#xD;
      lymphoma (TCL), natural killer cell lymphoma (NKL) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML) are&#xD;
      aggressive diseases which may express the early T cell development molecule CD7.&#xD;
&#xD;
      T-ALL represents 15% of childhood and 25% of adult ALL, and T-ALL patients are prone to early&#xD;
      disease relapse and suffer from poor outcomes. Several immunophenotypic classifications have&#xD;
      been proposed. According to European Group for the Immunological Characterization of&#xD;
      Leukemias (EGIL), the presence of cytoplasmic or membrane expression of CD3 defines T-ALL.&#xD;
      Four subgroups are proposed: (TI) the immature subgroup or pro-T-ALL is defined by the&#xD;
      expression of CD7 and cCD3; (TII) pre-T-ALL also expresses CD2 and/or CD5 and/or CD8; (TIII)&#xD;
      or cortical T-ALL shows CD1a positivity; (TIV) finally, mature T-ALL is characterized by the&#xD;
      presence of surface CD3 and CD1a negativity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Over the past few years, T cells modified with lentiviral chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)&#xD;
      gene have been studied in different clinical settings. CD7 is a T cell surface protein that&#xD;
      plays important role in T cell-B cell interaction in early lymphoid development, displays&#xD;
      membrane expression early during T cell development before TCR rearrangement, and persists&#xD;
      through terminal stages of T cell development, and a well-known marker for T-ALL. CD7 is&#xD;
      considered a promising target for the treatment of T-ALL, TCL, AML and NKL. In this study, we&#xD;
      will investigate CD7 CAR-T in combination with alternative targeting CAR-T cells as a new&#xD;
      strategy to treat hematological malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The T cells from patients or transplantation donors will be genetically modified with&#xD;
      lentiviral CAR vector to recognize CD7 expressed on the surface of the cancer cells. The&#xD;
      engineered T cells will be applied to patients through intravenous delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this clinical trial is to assess the feasibility, safety and efficacy of&#xD;
      multiple CAR-T cell therapy in hematological malignancies. Another goal of the study is to&#xD;
      learn more about the function of CAR T cells and their persistence in the patients.&#xD;
