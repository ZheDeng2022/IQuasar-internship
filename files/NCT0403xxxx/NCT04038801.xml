    <textblock>
      This study aimed to compare the effects of full-mouth disinfection (FMD) and full-mouth&#xD;
      ultrasonic debridement (FMUD) on clinical, microbiologic and biochemical parameters with&#xD;
      conventional quadrant-wise scaling and root planning (Q-SRP) in patients with severe chronic&#xD;
      periodontitis. 60 patients with severe chronic periodontitis were randomly allocated to three&#xD;
      groups: FMD (n=20), FMUD (n=20) and Q-SRP (n=20). At baseline, gingival crevicular fluid&#xD;
      (GCF) and subgingival plaque were collected and clinical periodontal parameters were&#xD;
      recorded. Ultrasonic debridement was completed within 24 hours in FMD and FMUD groups.&#xD;
      Chlorhexidine gluconate was used for FMD. Q-SRP was performed by hand instruments per&#xD;
      quadrant at 1-week-intervals. Clinical parameters were recorded and samples were collected at&#xD;
      1, 3, 6 months after treatment. Real-time PCR was used for quantitative analysis of&#xD;
      Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia,&#xD;
      Tannerella forsythia, Fusobacterium nucleatum and total bacteria count. Calprotectin,&#xD;
      osteocalcin and cross-linked N-telopeptide of type I collagen (NTx) levels in GCF were&#xD;
      analysed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.&#xD;

      Study population and clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
      60 consecutive severe chronic periodontitis patients were recruited for the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The whole mouth clinical periodontal examination included measurement of probing depth,&#xD;
      clinical attachment level and plaque index at 6 sites per tooth, except the third molars The&#xD;
      papillary bleeding index was recorded for the entire oral cavity. Clinical periodontal&#xD;
      parameters were recorded at baseline and 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after treatments.&#xD;
      Alveolar bone loss were assessed using an digital panoromic radiograph in each participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of severe chronic periodontitis was based on clinical and radiographic&#xD;
      diagnostic criteria proposed by 1999 International Workshop for a Classification of&#xD;
      Periodontal Diseases and Conditions. These individuals had a minimum of four non-adjacent&#xD;
      teeth with sites with PD ≥6 mm and CAL ≥5 mm. They had also ≥50% alveolar bone loss in at&#xD;
      least two quadrants that was commensurate with amount of plaque accumulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All clinical measurements, GCF and plaque sampling and also all treatments were performed by&#xD;
      the same calibrated and trained investigator (B.A.) in a standardized manner (single-blinded&#xD;
      trial).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit, immediately before non-surgical periodontal treatment GCF and&#xD;
      subgingival plaque samples were collected per patient and clinical periodontal measurements&#xD;
      were recorded in all groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Q-SRP group, SRP were started with the upper right quadrant, and continued clockwise&#xD;
      over four visits at 1-weekly intervals. SRP was performed using an assortment of manual&#xD;
      periodontal curettes. The tooth surfaces were instrumented until it was visually and&#xD;
      tactilely free of all deposits. Re-examinations were performed at 1, 3 and 6 months following&#xD;
      the completion of the SRP in the lower right quadrant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the FMUD group, subgingival debridement were performed in upper jaw at the morning session&#xD;
      and in lower jaw at the afternoon session. The procedure was completed in two visits (with 45&#xD;
      minutes interval) of the same day. All periodontal sites were debrided by a piezoceramic&#xD;
      ultrasonic instrument with unmodified and modified inserts. Each tooth was instrumented till&#xD;
      the root surface was visually and tactilely clean and smooth. Re-examinations were performed&#xD;
      at 1, 3 and 6 months after the completion of full-mouth subgingival debridman.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the FMD group, ultrasonic subgingival debridman was combined with an intensive&#xD;
      antimicrobial regime with chlorhexidine. The dorsum of the tongue was brushed with a 1%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine gel for 1 minute. The patients were instructed to rinse twice for 1 minute with&#xD;
      0.2% chlorhexidine solution. Each tonsil was sprayed four times with 0.2% chlorhexidine&#xD;
      spray. Repeated subgingival irrigation with 1% chlorhexidine gel of all the pockets by a&#xD;
      blunt needle. This subgingival application was repeated at day 8. For 14 days after the&#xD;
      treatment, the patients were instructed to rinse twice daily for 1 min with 0.2%&#xD;
      chlorhexidine solution and to spray the tonsils twice daily with a 0.2% chlorhexidine spray.&#xD;
      Re-examinations were performed at 1, 3 and 6 months after 14 days washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard oral hygiene instructions were given all patients immediately after the first&#xD;
      session of Q-SRP group and the completion of the ultrasonic debridement in FMD and FMUD&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCF sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      GCF was sampled from the buccal aspects of two nonadjacent interproximal sites in&#xD;
      single-rooted teeth with PD ≥6 mm, CAL ≥5 mm and visible signs of inflammation at baseline.&#xD;
      Re-sampling was repeated at 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after treatment. Standardized&#xD;
      filter paper strips were used for GCF sampling. The absorbed fluid volume was measured with a&#xD;
      precalibrated electronic device. The paper strips were stored at -40◦C for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subgingival plaque sampling&#xD;
&#xD;
      After GCF collection, the subgingival plaque samples were collected from one site per&#xD;
      quadrant with the deepest PD (≥5 mm) of single-rooted teeth at baseline and 1 month, 3 months&#xD;
      and 6 months after treatment using two standardized no.30 sterile paper points. Pooled&#xD;
      samples were stored at -40◦C for further analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of calprotectin, osteocalcin, and NTx levels in GCF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two paper strips were pooled, placed in 300 microliter phosphatebuffered saline containing&#xD;
      0.05% polysorbate 20 and incubated for 20 minutes at room temperature on an orbital shaker.&#xD;
      The fluid from the paper strips was recovered by centrifugation at 13 000 rpm for 5 minutes&#xD;
      at +4◦C. Calprotectin, osteocalcin and NTx levels in GCF samples were measured by ELISA using&#xD;
      commercial kits in line with the manufacturer's guidelines. Plates were measured at 450 nm&#xD;
      with 650 nm as a reference wavelength by using an ELISA reader. Cytokine concentrations were&#xD;
      calculated from the standard curve. GCF results were expressed as total amounts at two sites&#xD;
      per sampling time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Molecular detection of target bacteria in subgingival plaque.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) method was used for the quantitative detection of the&#xD;
      selected periodontal pathogens in subgingival plaque. Total microbial DNA on paperpoints were&#xD;
      extracted using High Pure PCR Template Preparation Kit according to the manufacturer's&#xD;
      instructions. LightCycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR Green I Kit was used for the detection of&#xD;
      target oligonucleotides according to the manufacturer's instructions. Real-time PCR protocols&#xD;
      were constructed considering specific primer sets. Standard curves were constructed for the&#xD;
      calculation of target oligonucleotides in the samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to detect intra- and intergroup&#xD;
      differences in clinical, microbiological and biochemical parameters. Analysis of covariance&#xD;
      was used for comparison of the improvements in parameters between the three treatment groups&#xD;
      adjusting for the potential difference in the baseline data and Bonferroni test was performed&#xD;
      post-hoc. The significance level was set at p &lt;0.05.&#xD;
