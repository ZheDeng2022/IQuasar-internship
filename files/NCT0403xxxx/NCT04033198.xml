      Aims of this study are :&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Estimate the incidence of A.A. in patients above age of 30 y in 4 age groups .&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Correlate between different clinical aspects and histopathological results.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determine rate of negative appendectomy in those patients.&#xD;

      Acute appendicitisis the clinical condition which refer to inflammation of the vermiform&#xD;
      appendix1. It is the most common abdominal emergency2,3,4 .it accounts for more than 40,000&#xD;
      hospital admissions in England every year 5 . Approximately 8% of the population in Western&#xD;
      countries would have appendicitis during their life 6 .In the United States, the estimated&#xD;
      incidenc of acute appendicitis is 11 cases per 10,000 population 5 . However, in South&#xD;
      Africa, the incidencewas estimated to be less than 9 per 100,000 6 .Appendectomy is&#xD;
      considered the most common emergency surgical procedure worldwide6,8 ,9. The cause of acute&#xD;
      appendicitis is unknown but it is multifactorial; luminal obstruction , dietary and familial&#xD;
      factors have been suggested 5 . Fecoliths are the most common cause of obstruction. It was&#xD;
      demonstrated that the mean duration of abdominal pain in patients with gangrenous appendix is&#xD;
      46.2 hours and 70.9 hs for perforated 7 .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The peak incidence of acute appendicitis is at the age of 10 to 30 years 6,10. There are&#xD;
      special features for appendicitis according to age 1. A.A is primarily a disease of the&#xD;
      younger population, with only 5-10% of cases occurring in elderly people, but the incidence&#xD;
      of acute appendicitis in elderly began to increase with the increase in life expectancy14.&#xD;
      Older patients with acute abdominal pain are high-risk patients, unlike their younger&#xD;
      counterparts15 . Morbidity and mortality rates are greater in elderly due to atypical&#xD;
      presentations and delay in diagnosis leading to increase rate of perforation and&#xD;
      intra-abdominal infection.. They need to be clinically evaluated by experienced surgeons&#xD;
      within a narrow time margin14,15.&#xD;

        The study includes 70 patients with age above than thirty years old. The patients are&#xD;
        divided into 4 age groups :group 1 (30-39 y) , group 2(40-49), group 3(50-59) and group4&#xD;
        (patients older than 60 y) .They were admitted to our emergency hospital with features of&#xD;
        acute appendicitis. A detailed history was taken and clinical examination of the patient&#xD;
        was carried out at the time of admission .Data was collected regarding investigations (CBC&#xD;
        , GUE , US). Appendectomy done for the 70 patient,their operative findings along with any&#xD;
        complications as well as histopathological findings were recorded&#xD;
