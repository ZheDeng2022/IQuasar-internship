      This study evaluates efficacy of LY3023414 and prexasertib in patients with metastatic triple&#xD;
      negative breast cancer.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Seventy to eighty percent of breast cancers have a gene expression profile which is&#xD;
      characterized by homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) and high proliferation. HRD leads&#xD;
      to errors in DNA pathway [non -homologous end joining (NHEJ)] that repair DNA-breaks, a&#xD;
      process required for metastatic triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) survival. The hypothesis&#xD;
      of this pilot trial is that administration of LY3023414 and prexasertib will inhibit NHEJ in&#xD;
      metastatic TNBC.&#xD;

    <description>Patients with metastatic TNBC who meet the enrollment criteria will receive LY3023414 and prexasertib until disease progression. Patients whose disease does not respond to the combination of LY3023414 and prexasertib may be treated with standard of care breast cancer therapies off study, at the recommendation of the treating physician.</description>

    <intervention_name>Drug 1: LY3023414; Drug 2: Prexasertib</intervention_name>
    <description>Metastatic TNBC patients will consent to and undergo core needle biopsies of a metastatic lesion for NGS, RPPA, and other molecular analyses at study entry.&#xD;
Patients will then be treated with 150 mg LY3023414 PO BID and prexasertib 80 mg/m^2 IV administered every 2 weeks until disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Any time after the completion of Cycle 2 of the treatment combination, or at the physician's discretion, a second core needle biopsy of the same metastatic lesion (or different metastases if the initial metastasis has regressed) will be performed for RPPA and other molecular analyses. If a research biopsy from a patient's metastatic disease cannot be safely obtained, a skin biopsy is permitted.&#xD;
Treatment will be discontinued in patients who achieve a confirmed clinical complete response, and these patients will be followed to document the durability of the complete responses.</description>

&#xD;
          1. Patients ≥18 years of age. Patients must agree to use one highly effective (less than&#xD;
             1% failure rate) method of contraception or use a combination of two effective methods&#xD;
             of contraception during treatment with study drug and for at least 12 weeks following&#xD;
             the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Have a diagnosis of metastatic TNBC previously treated with standard anthracycline,&#xD;
             cyclophosphamide, and taxane chemotherapy, unless there was a contraindication to&#xD;
             doxorubicin, in which case prior treatment with this agent is not required. NOTE: TNBC&#xD;
