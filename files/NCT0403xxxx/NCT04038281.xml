  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is an increasing problem for adults in the UK. Diets high in fat and sugar are the&#xD;
      major contributors to weight gain. Individual differences in taste perception are a crucial&#xD;
      factor in determining the investigator's choice of foods and an individual's sensitivity to&#xD;
      the either bitter or fat taste compounds has been linked to a preference for different foods&#xD;
      including sweet and high fat foods. Previous research has not comprehensively explored the&#xD;
      effect of both fat and bitter taste sensitivity on dietary intake and obesity status.&#xD;
      Therefore, the aim of this study is to explore the associations between genetics, fat and&#xD;
      bitter taste sensitivity, food preference, dietary intake and obesity measures in the adult&#xD;
      UK population.&#xD;

      Demographic data Participants will complete a questionnaire asking about their demographics&#xD;
      provided in Appendix. The answers to these questions will be used to control for potential&#xD;
      confounding effects in statistical analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Genetic Analysis Saliva samples (2 ml) will be collected for DNA analyses (Genefix, Isohelix,&#xD;
      Kent, UK) and stored in the fridge at 4 °C in M201 lab at St Mary's University. DNA&#xD;
      extraction will be carried out through use of a PSP® SalivaGene 17 DNA Kit 1011 following the&#xD;
      standard manufacturer protocol. DNA quantification and quality control will be assessed with&#xD;
      spectroscopy. Following this, genotyping will be carried out using prepared TaqMan® SNP&#xD;
      genotyping assays for genes coding for bitter and fat taste receptors and a StepOnePlus&#xD;
      thermocycler. All samples will be analysed in duplicate in accordance with the manufacturer's&#xD;
      protocol. All genetic analyses will be carried out at St Mary's University, Twickenham.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometrics Height (m), weight (kg) and waist circumference (cm) will be recorded by the&#xD;
      researcher team. BMI will be calculated using the equation: weight (kg)/ height (m2) ±&#xD;
      standard deviation and waist circumference and distribution will be compared to the UK&#xD;
      standards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat and bitter taste sensitivity The Oral Fatty Acid Threshold Assessment and Ascending&#xD;
      Forced Choice Triangle Procedure will be used to determine each participant's oleic acid&#xD;
      (C18:1) detection threshold (fat taste sensitivity). Briefly, each participant will be&#xD;
      presented with three cups containing 30 ml vehicles in a random arrangement, two controls and&#xD;
      the third containing oleic acid (0.02, 0.06, 1, 1.4, 2, 2.8, 3.8, 5, 6.4, 8, 9.8, 12, 20 mM).&#xD;
      Participants will have to identify the oleic acid solution by tasting but not ingesting the&#xD;
      solutions. A participant will be required to choose the oleic acid solution correctly three&#xD;
      times at the same concentration to define their threshold. If participant is incorrect at any&#xD;
      point, further three cups will be presented, one containing the higher concentration. There&#xD;
      will be thirteen concentrations in total. The bitter taste compound used to classify&#xD;
      participants into bitter taste hypo-, normal- and hypertasters will be PTC. Participants will&#xD;
      place a strip on the tongue and use the general Labeled Magnitude Scale (gLMS) to report the&#xD;
      intensity of the taste compound.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Food preference Food preference will be measured by asking participants to taste food usually&#xD;
      perceived as bitter (dark chocolate and broccoli) as well as food that are defined as sweet&#xD;
      (milk chocolate and carrots).To minimise variability, the vegetables will be presented raw.&#xD;
      Overall preference will be tested using a nine-point Likert scale. Each participants will&#xD;
      rinse their mouth with water between each food and a minimum of one minute will be left&#xD;
      between each test. Eating behaviour will be determined by use of the validated Adult Eating&#xD;
      Behaviour Questionnaire. Fat preference will be determined by a UK adaption of the validated&#xD;
      Fat Preference Questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary Intake The validated EPIC Norfolk Food Frequency Questionnaire (FFQ) will be used to&#xD;
      measure dietary intake over the previous year.&#xD;
