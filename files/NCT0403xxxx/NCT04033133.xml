      With this study, the investigators will substantiate if regional cerebral blood flow (CBF) is&#xD;
      affected by tDCS, assess the amount of CBF change in relation to different currents, and&#xD;
      measure differences in regional CBF under stimulation reactivity between healthy subjects and&#xD;
      people with Multiple Sclerosis (PwMS)using Water O-15 PET (Water Oxygen-15 Positron&#xD;
      EmissionTomography) imaging. The objective is to investigate the changes in regional CBF&#xD;
      after transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) at different intensities (1 mA, 2 mA, 3&#xD;
      mA, 4 mA) in healthy subjects and PwMS. The design is a cross-sectional proof of principle&#xD;
      study in 10 healthy subjects and 10 PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Relative regional brain CBF (rCBF) will be analyzed semi-quantitatively using voxel-wise and&#xD;
      region of interest-based approaches. Changes in CBF associated with tDCS-application will be&#xD;
      calculated with a general linear model in a ramp function of the task-specific rCBF,&#xD;
      according to previous work in our group using a glucose analogue. Exploratory statistical&#xD;
      testing will be done using a paired samples t-test between task and rest conditions and&#xD;
      unpaired t-tests between PwMS and healthy controls at the same intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study the investigators will be able to dose-dependently measure real-time rCBF&#xD;
      changes after non-invasively stimulating the superficial parts of the dorsolateral prefrontal&#xD;
      cortex (DLPFC), a commonly used target in therapeutic tDCS applications. This will provide&#xD;
      further insight into whether tDCS is capable of inducing changes in rCBF.&#xD;

      Aim 1: To determine the effects of different stimulation intensities on relative cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow (rCBF).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, researchers use tDCS as an interventional modality to modulate the excitability of&#xD;
      the brain, with measureable changes in both motor evoked potentials and physical&#xD;
      performances. However, because of the relatively large size of most electrodes, and the&#xD;
      electrodynamics of the brain, it still remains unclear what specific brain structures are&#xD;
      being stimulated and how the mechanics of stimulation (e.g., stimulation penetration and&#xD;
      areas affected outside of target area) change with different intensities. The investigators&#xD;
      hypothesize that regional CBF at the DLPFC (target area) will increase in a dose-dependent&#xD;
      way with greater stimulation intensity. Furthermore, it is hypothesized that the areas&#xD;
      surrounding the DLPFC will be increasingly affected by higher stimulation intensities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To contrast the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation on relative&#xD;
      cerebral blood flow between healthy subjects and people with Multiple Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PwMS typically present with glucose hypometabolism compared to their healthy peers and&#xD;
      because CBF and glucose metabolism are highly coupled, a similar trend in CBF may be&#xD;
      expected. Additionally, tDCS has been shown to be effective at increasing cortical&#xD;
      excitability and glucose metabolism in both populations. However, what still remains&#xD;
      uncertain is if PwMS and healthy subjects experience the same amount of increased activity&#xD;
      for the same stimulation intensity. The investigators hypothesize that PwMS will experience a&#xD;
      greater increase in rCBF at the DLPFC and surrounding areas than healthy controls for the&#xD;
      same stimulation intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To extend our understanding of the safety and efficacy of transcranial direct current&#xD;
      stimulation at higher current intensities for healthy subjects and people with Multiple&#xD;
      Sclerosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite some work on the feasibility and safety of performing tDCS at intensities &gt; 2 mA&#xD;
      (i.e., up to 4 mA), the convention for most tDCS studies is to use intensities less than or&#xD;
      equal to 2 mA. This has been sufficient to illicit measurable effects in both excitability&#xD;
      and performance outcomes. However, the potential benefits of increasing intensity to either&#xD;
      enhance the effects of a given stimulation protocol (e.g., time or magnitude) or to&#xD;
      potentially access deeper brain areas justifies further exploration of current intensities &gt;&#xD;
      2 mA. It is also important to add to the safety protocol of higher intensities in healthy and&#xD;
      clinical (e.g., PwMS) subjects. The investigators hypothesize that higher intensities (i.e.,&#xD;
      &gt; 2 mA) will be well tolerated by both healthy subjects and PwMS. Additionally, the&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize no serious adverse effects from higher stimulation intensities. The&#xD;
      existing side-effects of tDCS at intensities less than or equal to 2 mA include low-grade&#xD;
      occurrences of tingling, itching, and burning sensation at the electrode sites; a few&#xD;
      subjects have reported short-lived (&lt; 5 min) headaches. In a study testing the safety of&#xD;
      higher intensities similar to those proposed here, these same side-effects were observed in&#xD;
      50% of the subjects. This rate of occurrence is slightly higher than studies using less than&#xD;
      or equal to 2 mA, but the magnitudes of the negative effects were still well within safely&#xD;
      tolerable limits and were all transient in nature.&#xD;
&#xD;
      I.6 Background and significance and/or Preliminary studies related to this project.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (do not indicate &quot;see protocol&quot;) Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a&#xD;
      non-invasive and well-tolerated brain stimulation technique (1-4) that can modulate the&#xD;
      cortical excitability of targeted brain regions (5) as well as cerebral blood flow (6) in a&#xD;
      polarity-dependent manner.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Models of tDCS current flow (7,8) and findings from studies in which human functional&#xD;
      magnetic resonance Imaging (fMRI) has been used to measure brain activity (9-11) suggest that&#xD;
      tDCS can alter processing across large areas of the cortex. In this sense, the effects of&#xD;
      tDCS are likely to be relatively broad. Thus, while the neural changes induced by tDCS are&#xD;
      concentrated around regions of cortex closest to the electrodes (12), broader networks of&#xD;
      functionally-connected regions may also be recruited (9,10,13,14). Furthermore, no systematic&#xD;
      investigation has been done to determine the most efficacious current intensity for PwMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is empirical evidence that tDCS with current intensity between 1 and 2 mA for 20-40&#xD;
      minutes for either single or multiple sessions can safely and effectively be administered to&#xD;
      PwMS (15-20). Although tDCS with current intensities &gt; 2 mA are considered safe 21, no&#xD;
      studies have investigated how brain activity is affected during tDCS at intensities &gt; 2 mA.&#xD;
      Although the safety of higher intensity tDCS in PwMS may be initially assumed from previous&#xD;
      work using subjects who have experienced a stroke (21), it has also been suggested that more&#xD;
      studies on the safety of higher intensity stimulation in other populations are needed in&#xD;
      order to exercise due diligence before widely prescribing intensities greater than the&#xD;
      present convention (22).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cerebral activation in PwMS has been investigated with [15O] water and with [15O] O2 PET&#xD;
      (indexes oxygen metabolism)(23). Widespread reductions in cerebral blood flow and oxygen&#xD;
      metabolism in both gray and white mater have been reported in PwMS (24). Furthermore, these&#xD;
      studies indicate that the degree of oxygen metabolism reduction correlated with worse&#xD;
      cognitive performance and expanded disability status scale (EDSS), and that the degree of&#xD;
      cerebral oxygen hypometabolism was associated with the number of relapses (25).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A close coupling of perfusion and metabolism is assumed, reflecting oxidative phosphorylation&#xD;
      of glucose as the predominant source of energy production. Consequently, CBF is often&#xD;
      considered as an indirect measure of neuronal function and integrity (26). This is supported&#xD;
      by the significant association of metabolism with regional CBF (rCBF) across different brain&#xD;
      regions (27,28), and with global CBF (gCBF) across varying states of consciousness (29).&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this study, the investigators will be able to substantiate if rCBF is affected by tDCS,&#xD;
      assess the amount of signal change in relation to different currents, and measure differences&#xD;
      in CBF distribution under stimulation reactivity between healthy subjects and PwMS. The&#xD;
      objective is to investigate the changes in rCBF after transcranial direct current stimulation&#xD;
      at different intensities (1 mA, 2 mA, 3 mA, 4 mA) in healthy subjects and PwMS. The design is&#xD;
      a cross-sectional proof of principle study in 10 healthy subjects and 10 PwMS.&#xD;
