      Purpose: In this study, the investigators will delineate how brain network dynamics are&#xD;
      modulated by experimentally induced elevated blood glucose levels and examine how glucose&#xD;
      levels gate neuronal excitability measured by the response to TMS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Participants must be between the ages of 18 and 65 with no known diabetes, no&#xD;
      known adverse reaction to finger prick blood draw, and no known neurological or psychiatric&#xD;
      illness. Participants must have a body-mass index less than 30.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures: Participants will consume either a drink that contains 75 g of glucose or a&#xD;
      placebo, and their response to TMS will be measured to examine the effect of glucose on motor&#xD;
      cortex excitability.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study will be a placebo-controlled study that investigates brain function with both&#xD;
      electroencephalography (EEG) and TMS. On each study visit, a drink (either glucose drink or&#xD;
      water) is administered after baseline assessment of fasting glucose. Changes in brain&#xD;
      activity and excitability will be measured with resting-state EEG. Periodic high-density EEG&#xD;
      of resting-state brain activity and activity during a working memory task will be performed&#xD;
      before the administration of the drink, immediately after the administration of the drink, as&#xD;
      well as 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, and 180 minutes after the&#xD;
      administration of the drink. The spectral content of the EEG signal will be investigated to&#xD;
      identify the relative presence of cortical oscillations. Primarily, there will be a focus on&#xD;
      theta (4-8 Hz) and alpha (8-12 Hz) oscillations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Previous literature indicates that theta and alpha oscillations represent an engaged and&#xD;
      disengaged cortical state, respectively [1]. Alpha and theta oscillations are implicated in&#xD;
      cognitive function and are altered in depression. Therefore, this study aims to identify a&#xD;
      decrease in frontal theta oscillations and an increase in left frontal alpha oscillations,&#xD;
      two defining features of impaired top-down control and mood regulation, in response to the&#xD;
      glucose drink contrasted with the response to the placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will also examine how glucose levels gate neuronal excitability measured by the&#xD;
      response to TMS. Cortical excitability will be measured by applying TMS pulses to the motor&#xD;
      cortex and measuring the response in the form of a motor evoked potential by electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG). TMS will be applied before the administration of the drink, immediately after the&#xD;
      administration of the drink, as well as 30 minutes, 60 minutes, 120 minutes, 150 minutes, and&#xD;
      180 minutes after the administration of the drink. Changes in blood glucose will be monitored&#xD;
      over this time interval as well.&#xD;

    <description>The TMS Evoked Potential (TEP) is the difference in microvolts from 25 milliseconds after a TMS pulse versus pre-TMS such that greater values indicate greater motor cortex excitability. The measure of the change in TEP over time since either glucose or water was consumed approximates a z-distribution with a range of -20 to 20 with central distribution measures of zero. TEPs were source localized and reported using a pseudo-neural activity index (PNAI) expressing source activation in relation to pre-TMS pulse trial baseline. The difference in the source peaks corresponding to the early P25 component have been reported as differences from baseline. Higher values indicate greater cortical excitation, consistent with the study hypothesis.</description>

    <description>This outcome will analyze the change in accuracy in a computerized working memory task over time. During the task, subjects will be presented with an array of colored squares. Then, they will need to hold this array in mind during a delay period. Finally, participants will be tested on their memory of the array by responding whether a presented color is the same or different as the corresponding square in the first array. Participants' accuracy will be expressed as the percentage of correct responses (from 0% correct responses to 100% correct responses). An accuracy rate of 50% indicates that the participant is performing at the same accuracy level as random chance.</description>

        <title>TMS Evoked Potential (TEP)</title>
        <description>The TMS Evoked Potential (TEP) is the difference in microvolts from 25 milliseconds after a TMS pulse versus pre-TMS such that greater values indicate greater motor cortex excitability. The measure of the change in TEP over time since either glucose or water was consumed approximates a z-distribution with a range of -20 to 20 with central distribution measures of zero. TEPs were source localized and reported using a pseudo-neural activity index (PNAI) expressing source activation in relation to pre-TMS pulse trial baseline. The difference in the source peaks corresponding to the early P25 component have been reported as differences from baseline. Higher values indicate greater cortical excitation, consistent with the study hypothesis.</description>
        <time_frame>Measurements will be taken before the administration of the drink, as well as 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the administration of the drink.</time_frame>
        <population>From the 10 participants who completed, 3 were excluded from the analysis due to technical reasons. Two participants had to end their glucose visits early due to scheduling conflicts. The reported N below is adjusted where appropriate.</population>

        <title>Working Memory Task Accuracy</title>
        <description>This outcome will analyze the change in accuracy in a computerized working memory task over time. During the task, subjects will be presented with an array of colored squares. Then, they will need to hold this array in mind during a delay period. Finally, participants will be tested on their memory of the array by responding whether a presented color is the same or different as the corresponding square in the first array. Participants' accuracy will be expressed as the percentage of correct responses (from 0% correct responses to 100% correct responses). An accuracy rate of 50% indicates that the participant is performing at the same accuracy level as random chance.</description>
        <time_frame>Measurements will be taken before the administration of the drink, as well as 0, 30, 60, 120, and 180 minutes after the administration of the drink.</time_frame>
        <population>From the 10 participants who completed, one was excluded from the analysis due to technical reasons. Two participants had to end their glucose visits early due to scheduling conflicts. The reported N below is adjusted where appropriate.</population>

      <pi_employee>All Principal Investigators ARE employed by the organization sponsoring the study.</pi_employee>
      <restrictive_agreement>There is NOT an agreement between Principal Investigators and the Sponsor (or its agents) that restricts the PI's rights to discuss or publish trial results after the trial is completed. </restrictive_agreement>
    </certain_agreements>
    <limitations_and_caveats>The end sample sizes are lower than intended as the trial was ended early due to COVID-19-related research drawdowns. Technical limitations in the Electroencephalogram (EEG) and Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) data collection resulted in N=1 and N=3 dataset to be excluded from final analyses, respectively.</limitations_and_caveats>
