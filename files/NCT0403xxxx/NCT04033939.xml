  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is the first clinical trial of HSK3486 and will be conducted in healthy volunteers to&#xD;
      determine the safety, tolerability (including pain on injection), and PK(only to be assessed&#xD;
      for subjects who are randomized to HSK3486 in Cohorts 3 to 8)and PD and profiles of HSK3486&#xD;
      administered as a single IV injection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results from this study will supports further clinical development of HSK3486. This study&#xD;
      will be performed in compliance with the protocol, International Conference on Harmonization&#xD;
      Good Clinical Practice (ICH GCP) and local regulatory requirements. Aspects of the study&#xD;
      concerned with the investigational product will meet the requirements of Good Manufacturing&#xD;
      Practice (GMP).&#xD;

    <masking_description>Following Screening, subjects who meet the inclusion/exclusion criteria will be assigned a subject number in the order in which they are enrolled in the study. The subject number will determine the allocation of treatment as per the randomization list which will be generated by INCResearch Australia Pty Ltd and provided to the pharmacist. Cohorts 1 and 2 are a placebo controlled design, with open-labelling for the sentinel subjects and double-blind thereafter. Cohorts 3 to 8 are an open-label, positive controlled design.</masking_description>
