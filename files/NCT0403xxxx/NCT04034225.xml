  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To evaluate safety, immunogenicity and anti-tumor responses of intradermally delivered&#xD;
      SNS-301 added to checkpoint inhibitor therapy in locally advanced unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic/recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck (SCCHN) patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1/2, open-label, multi-center trial to evaluate the safety, immunogenicity&#xD;
      and preliminary clinical efficacy of SNS-301 delivered intradermally in addition to&#xD;
      pembrolizumab in patients with locally advanced unresectable or metastatic/recurrent SCCHN.&#xD;
      The trial population consists of patients with locally advanced unresectable or&#xD;
      metastatic/recurrent SCCHN who are currently receiving checkpoint inhibitor (CPI) therapy&#xD;
      (Cohort A) or are naïve to CPI therapy (Cohort B). Patients who are currently receiving CPI&#xD;
      therapy must have a best response of stable disease (SD) or first evidence of progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD) after a minimum of 12 weeks of treatment with a CPI. Patients receiving a CPI&#xD;
      other than pembrolizumab will be switched over to pembrolizumab at the time of entering this&#xD;
      study. Patients receiving pembrolizumab in the first line setting must be PD-L1 positive.&#xD;
