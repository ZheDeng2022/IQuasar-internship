  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Inhibitors of sodium-dependent glucose-transporter 2 (including dapagliflozin) represent&#xD;
      intensively investigated drugs in the field of diabetes. SGLT-2 inhibition limits glucose&#xD;
      reabsorption in renal tubular cells, hereby increasing the amount of glucose excreted via&#xD;
      urine in the hyperglycemic state. Its mechanisms of action are independent of insulin, the&#xD;
      indispensable standard of care in Type 1 Diabetes (T1D). Several international diabetes&#xD;
      experts highlighted the need for adjunct therapies in T1D.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subcutaneous application of insulin is non-physiological. Most significant, subcutaneous&#xD;
      insulin substitution does not address the bi-hormonal character of T1D. The loss of&#xD;
      pancreatic beta cells and subsequent endogenous insulin production uncouples alpha cell&#xD;
      derived glucagon secretion from its paracrine suppressor. Consequently, excess glucagon&#xD;
      concentrations occur in the fasting and the postprandial state, which promotes hyperglycemia,&#xD;
      requires higher doses of subcutaneous insulin, and promotes glycaemic variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recent studies on SGLT-2 inhibition in T1D showed better glycemic control compared to&#xD;
      placebo, whereas a higher risk for the development of diabetic ketoacidosis was observed.&#xD;
      Knowledge about the underlying mechanisms is scarce. Studies showed that SGLT-inhibition&#xD;
      increased Glucagon-like-peptide 1 (GLP-1) in T1D, an incretin hormone capable of suppressing&#xD;
      glucagon. On the other side, total concentrations of ketone bodies were higher following&#xD;
      SGLT-2 inhibition, irrespective of ongoing subcutaneous or intravenous insulin substitution.&#xD;
      The present study aims to investigate the effect of SGLT-2 inhibitor dapagliflozin on&#xD;
      hormonal regulators of glucose homeostasis and ketogenesis in T1D. The primary endpoint is&#xD;
      the difference of GLP-1 during oral glucose tolerance test clamps (OGGTc). Secondary&#xD;
      endpoints comprise total ketone body concentrations, free fatty acids, glucagon, and&#xD;
      somatostatin during OGTTc and hyperinsulinemic, euglycemic clamps (HEC) following&#xD;
      dapagliflozin and placebo. The study recruits male and female patients with T1DM in a&#xD;
      randomized, open label, cross-over intervention study.&#xD;
