    <textblock>
      Lyme arthritis resolves with appropriate antimicrobial treatment in a majority of patients,&#xD;
      but 10-20% of patients develop antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis with prolonged arthritis&#xD;
      symptoms and treatment courses. Excessive up-regulation of the inflammatory process has been&#xD;
      shown in patients with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. The over-expressed&#xD;
      pro-inflammatory cell mediators are downstream of NSAID inhibition, which would suggest&#xD;
      initial inflammatory inhibition may be beneficial in these patients. While NSAIDs are known&#xD;
      to reduce pro-inflammatory cell mediators early in the course of inflammation, research has&#xD;
      shown that there are other cytokines that play a role in the healing after inflammation that&#xD;
      are also inhibited by NSAIDs, and that NSAID use can delay healing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not known if scheduled NSAID therapy will reduce, increase, or have no effect on the&#xD;
      occurrence of refractory Lyme arthritis cases. The hypothesis of the study is that&#xD;
      prescribing scheduled NSAIDs at the time of diagnosis of Lyme arthritis can prevent the&#xD;
      development of the excessive inflammatory phase and decrease the number of patients with&#xD;
      antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, or at least decrease the duration of persistent Lyme&#xD;
      arthritis symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The pilot study design randomizes patients to scheduled NSAIDs, scheduled acetaminophen, or&#xD;
      scheduled NSAIDs x 1 week than acetaminophen. Primary outcomes are duration of arthritis&#xD;
      symptoms, number of refractory cases, side effects and compliance.&#xD;

      Specific Aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Demonstrate feasibility to ensure adequate patient enrollment and symptomatic follow-up&#xD;
           of patients with Lyme arthritis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Develop pilot data necessary for sample size and power calculations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of the research study is to evaluate whether there is symptomatic benefit of&#xD;
      schedule NSAID therapy in patients with Lyme arthritis diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Quantification of antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis in our population&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Symptomatic outcomes of patients with Lyme arthritis on scheduled NSAIDs versus those&#xD;
           not placed on scheduled NSAIDs (duration to resolution and number of patients with&#xD;
           resistant arthritis)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Assess side effects of patients with Lyme arthritis placed on scheduled NSAIDs versus&#xD;
           those not placed on scheduled NSAIDs&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Assess changes in resources (follow-up visits, further prescriptions) required for&#xD;
           patients taking scheduled NSAIDs versus not taking scheduled NSAIDs&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lyme disease is the systemic tick-borne disease caused by Borrelia burgdorferi infection, and&#xD;
      is endemic to an expanding portion of the United States. Lyme arthritis is a common&#xD;
      presentation of Lyme disease. While Lyme arthritis resolves with appropriate antimicrobial&#xD;
      treatment in a majority of patients, 10-20% of patients develop antibiotic-refractory Lyme&#xD;
      arthritis with prolonged inflammatory arthritis. Research suggests excessive up-regulation of&#xD;
      the inflammatory process in patients with prolonged symptoms. The over-expressed pro-&#xD;
      inflammatory cell mediators are downstream of NSAID inhibition, which would suggest NSAIDs&#xD;
      may be beneficial in these patients. In fact, there is data that NSAIDs and/or&#xD;
      disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be beneficial in refractory Lyme&#xD;
      arthritis cases, once diagnosed as refractory.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The hypothesis of the study is that prescribing scheduled NSAIDs at the time of diagnosis can&#xD;
      prevent the development of the excessive inflammatory phase and decrease the number of&#xD;
      patients with antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis, or at least decrease the duration of&#xD;
      persistent Lyme arthritis symptoms. There are no known methods to identify patients who will&#xD;
      develop antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis. This work is important to delineate optimal&#xD;
      timing and duration of NSAIDs given the research that shows the anti- inflammatory effects&#xD;
      during healing can potentially delay recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While antibiotic-refractory Lyme arthritis has been studied at a microbiologic/cytokine level&#xD;
      as well as evaluated in terms of treatment once patients have been deemed antibiotic&#xD;
      refractory, to our knowledge there are no published studies evaluating prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With no literature looking at the question of NSAIDs for the prevention of antibiotic-&#xD;
      refractory Lyme arthritis, this pilot study is needed to adequately calculate sample size and&#xD;
      power calculations for a large-scale multicenter study. There is anecdotal data from the&#xD;
      Rheumatology and Infectious Disease departments at the UPMC Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh&#xD;
      that early scheduled NSAIDs may decrease refractory cases, but there has been no formal&#xD;
      evaluation into this question. Retrospective evaluation is challenging since the medications&#xD;
      in question (NSAIDs) are over the counter, and clinicians may recommend scheduled or&#xD;
      intermittent NSAID therapy without documentation, and certainly without prescriptions in the&#xD;
      medical record. Many patients with refractory Lyme arthritis are placed on NSAIDs, but given&#xD;
      the question of delayed healing with inhibition of prostaglandins during the healing phase of&#xD;
      inflammation, the question of whether NSAIDs are beneficial in patients to prevent refractory&#xD;
      arthritis is worthwhile rather than the current process of variable NSAID prescription.&#xD;
