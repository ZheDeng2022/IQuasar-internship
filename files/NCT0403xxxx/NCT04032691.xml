  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This investigator initiated, pilot study will assess the feasibility of characterizing the&#xD;
      effects of an orally administered alpha-2 adrenergic (a2a) agonist, clonidine, on the&#xD;
      clearance rates of Carbon-11 butanol from the ventricular cerebrospinal fluid (vCSF) with&#xD;
      positron emission tomography (PET) in healthy volunteers.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This will be an open label pilot study of feasibility in healthy volunteers with no&#xD;
      therapeutic intent. Vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters, and sleep quality will&#xD;
      be measured repeatedly during a one week lead-in period. Then, the ventricular cerebrospinal&#xD;
      fluid (vCSF) clearance rates of [11C]butanol will be measured with PET before and after one&#xD;
      week of treatment with clonidine, 0.1 mg by mouth daily at bedtime. Safety surveillance will&#xD;
      be augmented with home health monitoring devices that are wifi and blue tooth enabled.&#xD;
      Surveillance for adverse events related to drug discontinuation will be monitored for one&#xD;
      week during a washout period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective: To assess the logistical feasibility and safety of treating normotensive&#xD;
      adults with clonidine and monitoring its effects with home health devices. The primary&#xD;
      outcome measure will be the number of adverse events (AEs) or serious adverse events (SAEs).&#xD;
      Other measures will include changes in sleep quality, vital signs and ECG parameters, such as&#xD;
      the PR and corrected QT intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives: To estimate drug-induced changes in vCSF clearance rates of butanol&#xD;
      with PET scans acquired before and after treatment as a function of steady-state plasma&#xD;
      levels of clonidine.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Able to give informed consent. No vulnerable populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 18-to-89 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Mini-Mental Status Examination of â‰¥ 28&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed by the screening procedures to still be reasonably healthy and, in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigators, likely to tolerate the imaging procedures. For example,&#xD;
             patients with chronic low back pain might not be able to lie still for very long.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Confirmed by the screening procedures to have normal hemodynamic function. Systolic&#xD;
             blood pressure and pulse must be higher than 120 mmHg and 60 beats per minute (bpm)&#xD;
             while sitting. At the discretion of the investigators, athletic people who engage in&#xD;
             vigorous exercise of one hour or more at least four times per week may be enrolled if&#xD;
             their systolic blood pressure and pulse are higher than 100 mmHg and 50 beats per&#xD;
             minute while sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unremarkable electrocardiograms with PR intervals of less than 200 mSec and QT&#xD;
             interval corrected with Frederica's method (QTcF) of less than 440 mSec.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to refrain from abusing any recreational drugs, including marijuana&#xD;
             because of its sleep effects, and drink less than one unit of alcoholic beverages per&#xD;
             day starting one week prior to the lead-in period, and avoided for the next three&#xD;
             weeks while on study (the one week lead-in period, one week on drug period, and one&#xD;
             week washout period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain from donating blood during the month of study (because of its&#xD;
             potential effect of quickening pulse).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain from participating in any other research study that requires taking&#xD;
             medication during the month of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain from being vaccinated during the month of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have not participated in research with exposure to ionizing radiation that would&#xD;
             result in approaching the exposure limits for healthy volunteers described in the Code&#xD;
             of Federal Regulations, Title 21 Part 361.1 (21CFR361.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to clonidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of multiple hypersensitivity reactions, as indicated by allergies to multiple&#xD;
             medications, foods, and seasonal pollens.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or physical examination suggestive of a condition, disorder, or disease that&#xD;
             could represent a contra-indication to taking an antihypertensive. The relative&#xD;
             contraindications to clonidine listed in the package insert under the section on&#xD;
             precautions will be exclusionary in this study. They include subjects with coronary&#xD;
             artery insufficiency syndromes, histories of myocardial infarction, cardiac conduction&#xD;
             abnormalities, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding will not be eligible to participate in the&#xD;
             study, as clonidine is classified as a Class C risk to a fetus. (In fact, there is a&#xD;
             safety signal in pregnant animal models that justifies exclusion, even if the signal&#xD;
             is weak.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History, physical examination or clinical laboratory test result suggestive of a&#xD;
             condition, disorder, or disease that could affect the adsorption, distribution,&#xD;
             metabolism or excretion of clonidine, including an alcohol abuse or dependence&#xD;
             disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine toxicology screen for drugs other than cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be a member of a vulnerable population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not have donated blood in the 30 days prior to the start of the lead-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not have participated in research administering drugs in the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not have been vaccinated in the 30 days prior to the start of the lead-in period.&#xD;
