  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      It is a randomized controlled trial to determine the total tramadol consumption after major&#xD;
      gynecological studies. Intervention groups include TAP block or local infiltration by the&#xD;
      surgeon. These will be compared to a control group. Total tramadol consumption will be&#xD;
      calculated and therefore pain control will be assessed.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      All patients will receive standardized general anesthetic with standard monitoring.&#xD;
      Anesthesia will be induced with intravenous (IV) tramadol (1milligram/kg), propofol (2 mg/kg)&#xD;
      and atracurium 0.5mg/kg. Anaesthesia will be maintained with oxygen/air (40:60) with one&#xD;
      MAC(Minimum Alveolar Concentration) of isoflurane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TAP block will be performed for Group T patients before surgical incision with the help of an&#xD;
      ultrasound and will be performed by two of the anesthesiologists who are part of this study.&#xD;
      The study drug for the TAP block will be two syringes of 20 ml containing bupivacaine 0.25%&#xD;
      with no other additives. For the infiltration group I, a 50ml syringe will contain 25ml of&#xD;
      0.5% Bupivacaine and 25ml of 5mics/ml epinephrine. These solutions will be made there and&#xD;
      then by the anesthesiologist and the drugs for these solutions will be provided by the&#xD;
      clinical trial unit. Allocation to group T, I and C will be according to the randomization&#xD;
      block explained earlier. For group T, the US-guided TAP block technique will be similar to&#xD;
      the method described by Hebbard and colleagues; (21) an ultrasound linear probe will be&#xD;
      positioned in the mid-axillary line in the axial plane half-way between the iliac crest and&#xD;
      the costal margin. Transversus abdominal plain will be located under ultrasound guidance. One&#xD;
      ml test injection of the study solution will be permitted to confirm needle location. A total&#xD;
      of 20ml of study solution will be injected on each side after aspiration to avoid&#xD;
      intravascular placement. Surgical incision will be given after 20 minutes of TAP. Additional&#xD;
      doses of Tramadol 10mg IV stat will be given on need basis (Rise of heart rate and blood&#xD;
      pressure more than 20 % of baseline).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Towards the end of surgery, 50 ml of solution prepared by the anesthesiologist will be used&#xD;
      for Group I. 50ml of 0.25% Bupivicaine with epinephrine will be poured into a sterile galley&#xD;
      pot, from which the surgeon will draw up the solution. The surgeon will be asked to spray&#xD;
      10ml of this solution on to the pouch of Douglas, 10ml in the peritoneum, 10ml in the rectus&#xD;
      sheath and 20ml in the skin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of Bupivicaine used for group I and T is less than the maximum safe dose which is&#xD;
      2.5mg per kg. Minimal side effects are reported using an ultrasound guided TAP block&#xD;
      technique(22). If an immediate side effect is noted while performing the technique, treatment&#xD;
      will be administered and the patient will be withdrawn from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group (C) will receive the standard anesthesia and analgesia as mentioned above&#xD;
      without any nerve block technique.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prophylactic antiemetics in the form of ondansetron 4mg IV stat block and IV paracetamol&#xD;
      15mg/kg will be administered 30 minutes before the end of surgery and diclofenac 100 mg&#xD;
      suppository will be administered at the end of surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Routine monitoring of intraoperative blood pressures, heart rates, (base line, induction,&#xD;
      surgical incision and at 10 minutes interval) administered fluid and drugs, surgical time and&#xD;
      estimated blood loss will be recorded on intraoperative chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of the surgical procedure, patients will be transferred to the post&#xD;
      anesthesia care unit (PACU). A standardized postoperative analgesic regimen, consisting of&#xD;
      regular rectal diclofenac 100 mg every 12 hours and oral paracetamol 1000mg every 6 hrs&#xD;
      combined with IV PCIA Tramadol (no baseline infusion, demand bolus dose 15 mg, lock out 8&#xD;
      min), will be commenced on admission to the PACU for all 3 groups. Total tramadol consumption&#xD;
      and side effects will be calculated at end of 12 hours.&#xD;
