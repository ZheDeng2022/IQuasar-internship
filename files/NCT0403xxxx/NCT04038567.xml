      This is a factorial experimental trial involving adult survivors of cardiorespiratory failure&#xD;
      treated in intensive care units (ICUs) that is conceptualized as the Optimization Phase of a&#xD;
      multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework. This will allow optimization of a mobile&#xD;
      mindfulness intervention by comparing eight different iterations across domains including&#xD;
      impact on symptoms, feasibility, acceptability, usability, scalability, and cost.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      As survival has improved for the 2 million people with cardiorespiratory failure managed&#xD;
      annually in US intensive care units (ICUs), it has become apparent that these patients suffer&#xD;
      from severe and persistent post-discharge symptoms of psychological distress including&#xD;
      depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, few targeted&#xD;
      interventions exist that are relevant to patients' experiences and that accommodate their&#xD;
      many physical, social, and financial barriers to personalized care. To fill this gap, an&#xD;
      innovative app-based mobile mindfulness training program twas developed hat promotes&#xD;
      automated care delivery and self-management of symptom-related distress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subsequently, a pilot randomized clinical trial (RCT) called the LIFT study (R34 AT00819)&#xD;
      compared mobile mindfulness to both a standard telephone mindfulness program and an ICU&#xD;
      education control among survivors of cardiorespiratory failure. Key findings were that mobile&#xD;
      mindfulness was feasibly delivered, acceptable, usable, and had a greater clinical impact on&#xD;
      psychological distress than either comparator. This trial also highlighted opportunities to&#xD;
      improve the intervention's impact related to its targeted population, content delivery, and&#xD;
      system technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To address these gaps, this 5-year project is conceptualized as the Optimization Phase of a&#xD;
      multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) framework. It will optimize mobile mindfulness with&#xD;
      four specific aims as described in the following sections. At the conclusion of this&#xD;
      factorial randomized clinical trial study involving 240 cardiorespiratory failure survivors,&#xD;
      a mobile mindfulness system fully optimized for usability, efficiency, scalability, and&#xD;
      clinical impact will be delivered that will be off-the-shelf ready for a next-step definitive&#xD;
      RCT-and can serve as a model for distance-based mind and body interventions.&#xD;
