  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      At two sites (Boston University and the University of Texas at Austin, under the MPI&#xD;
      direction of Drs. Otto and Smits) the investigators propose to randomly assign 240 adult&#xD;
      smokers who have achieved short-term abstinence following open treatment with a 4 session&#xD;
      cognitive-behavior therapy program combined with medication (nicotine patch, varenicline, or&#xD;
      bupropion, selected openly) to (1) d-cycloserine augmentation of multimodal cue exposure&#xD;
      therapy (CET), or (2) placebo augmentation of multimodal CET. This Stage II project is&#xD;
      designed to: (1) evaluate the short-term and long-term efficacy of the experimental&#xD;
      intervention, (2) further test putative mechanisms of change, (3) explore possible moderator&#xD;
      effects of theoretically-relevant variables, and (4) use innovative, multimodal CET&#xD;
      strategies. Putative mediators and smoking abstinence will be assessed during the&#xD;
      intervention period and up to 6 months following the quit attempt.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study utilizes on open phase of 4-sessions of cognitive-behavior therapy for smoking&#xD;
      cessation that is combined with open pharmacotherapy (selected by participants in&#xD;
      collaboration with the study medical team: nicotine patch, varenicline, or bupropion).&#xD;
      Session topics include educational (e.g., health risks of smoking, effectiveness of different&#xD;
      treatment approaches), motivational enhancement (e.g., identifying personally relevant&#xD;
      benefits of quitting, and costs of continuing to smoke), and cognitive-behavioral elements&#xD;
      (e.g., identifying smoking triggers, developing coping strategies for these triggers,&#xD;
      planning for high risk situations, relapse prevention). The study therapists will also make a&#xD;
      supportive phone call on the day of the quit attempt, with repeated check-in calls over the&#xD;
      quit window (i.e., weeks 4-6) as needed for individuals having difficulties reaching&#xD;
      abstinence. Participants who fail to achieve smoking cessation during the quit period window&#xD;
      will be referred for clinical treatment as desired in the center the study is conducted in or&#xD;
      an alternative site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following successful smoking abstinence at Week 0 (Week 0 is defined by 24 hr abstinence&#xD;
      within a two-week grace period of the target date), participants will be randomized to the&#xD;
      study drug condition (50 mg DCS or matching placebo) combined with cue-exposure therapy&#xD;
      (CET). CET is manualized and will have four modalities: (1) exposure to slides of smoking&#xD;
      (pictorial), (2) exposure to emotions and imagined situations that most reliably trigger an&#xD;
      urge to smoke (emotional/imaginal), (3) exposure to a participant's own cigarettes and pack&#xD;
      (in vivo),70 and (4) personalized and immersive 360Â° VR exposure (participants select the VR&#xD;
      scene-e.g., break time outside work, evening party, car ride that best corresponds to their&#xD;
      highest craving situation). CET sessions are scheduled for the quit week, one week later, and&#xD;
      again 8 weeks later. Smoking cessation assessments continue across 24 weeks of follow-up.&#xD;
