      Research Questions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To understand the clinical outcomes of patients treated with sunitinib in first line and&#xD;
      axitinib in second line in a real world setting as therapies for metastatic and/or advanced&#xD;
      renal cell carcinoma (mRCC).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. What is the progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated in first line with&#xD;
           sunitinib, and stratified by Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center / International&#xD;
           Metastatic Renal Cell Carcinoma Database Consortium (MSKCC/IMDC) risk category&#xD;
           (favourable, intermediate, poor)?&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. What is the progression free survival (PFS) of patients treated in second line with&#xD;
           axitinib, and stratified by MSKCC/IMDC risk category (favourable, intermediate, poor)?&#xD;

&#xD;
      The objectives listed below will also be assessed as exploratory analyses for various patient&#xD;
      subgroups of interest, and will be conducted if sufficient numbers of patients are available:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Axitinib PFS and OS, as a second line therapy following sunitinib, pazopanib, or&#xD;
           following other Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (e.g. sorafenib)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Axitinib PFS and OS as a third line therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Axitinib PFS and OS post-immunotherapy (IO), taking into consideration 2nd and 3rd&#xD;
           therapy lines, following all IO therapy options, E.g. atezolizumab/bevacizumab,&#xD;
           nivolumab/ipilumimab, nivolumab, interleukin-2&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. For the post-sunitinib axitinib cohort: What was the duration of sunitinib therapy&#xD;
           before patients transitioned to axitinib?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. For the post-pazopanib axitinib cohort: What was the duration of sunitinib therapy&#xD;
           before patients transitioned to axitinib?&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Is the duration of therapy on first line sunitinib and/or pazopanib related to duration&#xD;
           of therapy for second line axitinib?&#xD;
