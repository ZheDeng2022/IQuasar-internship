  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In the past few decades, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have rapidly&#xD;
      developed as effective, and probably the most cost-effective tools to connect most aspects of&#xD;
      family lives. Alongside the growth in popularity of ICTs and its role in promoting family&#xD;
      well-being, there is also an increasing appreciation that ICTs such as internet-enabled&#xD;
      devices and web-based applications can offer many advantages compared to traditional&#xD;
      face-to-face approaches when delivering behaviour change programmes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To gain more understanding of the potential new avenues of using ICT in programme&#xD;
      implementation, The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has initiated the Jockey Club SMART&#xD;
      Family-Link Project in collaboration with The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and NGOs. This&#xD;
      project aimed at helping 26 NGO-operated Integrated Family Service Centres and Integrated&#xD;
      Service Centres (Centres), making effective use of information and communications technology&#xD;
      (ICT) and data analytics, to enhance the quality and efficiency of their family service.&#xD;
      Besides, it aims at building the capabilities of front-line workers so as to achieve the goal&#xD;
      of enhancing family well-being by building an online training platform. We anticipated that&#xD;
      the platform will benefit social workers or service-related workers in terms of knowledge&#xD;
      transfer, experience sharing, and wisdom practice.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      In the past few decades, Information and Communications Technology (ICT) have rapidly&#xD;
      developed as effective, and probably the most cost-effective tools to connect most, if not&#xD;
      all, aspects of family lives. In Hong Kong, as of March 2016, the number of mobile service&#xD;
      subscribers was 16.72 million, representing one of the highest penetration rates in the world&#xD;
      at about 228.3 per cent; amongst these subscribers, 14.69 million were 3G/ 4G service&#xD;
      customers and there is a surge to 20,557 Terabytes (or an average of 1,358 Megabytes per&#xD;
      2.5G/3G/4G mobile user) recorded for local mobile data usage, representing a growth of 1.18&#xD;
      times and 1.58 times over the same period in 2015 and 2014 respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While alongside the growth in popularity of ICTs and its role in promoting family well-being,&#xD;
      there is also an increasing appreciation that ICTs such as internet-enabled devices and&#xD;
      web-based applications can offer many advantages compared to traditional face-to-face&#xD;
      approaches when delivering behaviour change programmes. It is believed that ICT helps&#xD;
      facilitate access to interventions from a large variety of settings at all times, bringing&#xD;
      the intervention to participants at times convenient to them and diminishing the influence of&#xD;
      the situational constraints on intervention participation rates. The rise of ICT has created&#xD;
      promising and potential new avenues and demand for implementing interventions related to&#xD;
      mental health and parenting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Hong Kong Jockey Club Charities Trust has initiated the Jockey Club SMART Family-Link&#xD;
      Project in collaboration with The University of Hong Kong (HKU) and NGOs, making effective&#xD;
      use of information and communications technology (ICT) and data analytics, aimed at helping&#xD;
      26 NGO-operated Integrated Family Service Centres and Integrated Service Centres (Centres),&#xD;
      to enhance the quality and efficiency of their family service. The project also aims at&#xD;
      building the capabilities of front-line workers so as to achieve the goal of enhancing family&#xD;
      well-being by building an online training platform.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The i-Training, Learning, and Sharing (i-TLS) platform will provide staff training and skills&#xD;
      enhancing through carefully selected materials in one convenient location, forums for wisdom,&#xD;
      experience, and information sharing between staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. i-Training: Using a variety of computerized formats, the i-Training platform may bring&#xD;
           professional training content to social workers at their convenience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. i-Learning: It provides a co-learning area for social and related service workers from&#xD;
           different service centers to learn from and support each other, such as the NGO-shared&#xD;
           best practice and the updated ICT information in relation to family services and&#xD;
           activities. This may enhance service effectiveness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. i-Sharing: It provides social and service-related workers with an instant online means&#xD;
           to share experiences and have discussions&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Platform will benefit social workers or service-related workers in terms of knowledge&#xD;
      transfer, experience sharing, and wisdom practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goal of the study is to assess the feasibility and effectiveness of using online i-TLS&#xD;
      platform to provide training and encourage a co-learning and sharing culture amongst social&#xD;
      work professionals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A process evaluation will be performed to evaluate the process of each component of the&#xD;
      program. Qualitative and quantitative assessments will be used to evaluate the effectiveness&#xD;
      of the activities&#xD;
