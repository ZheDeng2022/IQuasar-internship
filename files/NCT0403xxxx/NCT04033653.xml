  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a common critical illness in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). With the continuous&#xD;
      progress of severe medicine, the mortality rate of ICU hospitalization for sepsis has&#xD;
      decreased, but the long-term prognosis is not satisfied. Due to the high long-term mortality,&#xD;
      poor physical and mental health and cognitive impairment, the long-term quality of life&#xD;
      decreases greatly, putting great burden on the family and society. Therefore, it is of great&#xD;
      significance to understand the epidemiology and risk factors of the long-term prognosis of&#xD;
      sepsis and find out how to improve the prognosis .&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis is a clinical syndrome in which the body's host response to uncontrolled infection&#xD;
      leads to life-threatening organ dysfunction. In recent years, with the continuous improvement&#xD;
      of the early diagnosis ability of sepsis, the deepening of the understanding of&#xD;
      pathophysiology, and the continuous updating of treatment, the hospital mortality rate of&#xD;
      sepsis has decreased significantly. However, studies have shown that the prevalence of sepsis&#xD;
      is still increasing year by year, and the number of deaths due to sepsis is increasing.&#xD;
      Sepsis is the main cause of death in ICU patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the mortality rate of patients with sepsis is significantly reduced, the increasing&#xD;
      survival of patients with long-term outcome is not satisfied. All studies have shown that&#xD;
      patients with sepsis have a high long-term mortality, and the long-term physiological,&#xD;
      psychological, and cognitive function levels are reduced, which increases the economic burden&#xD;
      and mental burden of the family and society. The increasing number of discharges has been&#xD;
      considered a potential public health threat. In recent years, more and more researchers begin&#xD;
      to pay attention to the long-term outcome of sepsis survivors. But compared with other acute&#xD;
      or severe diseases, such as stroke, cancer, sepsis survivors has not been paid enough&#xD;
      attention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, all stages of treatment and rehabilitation of sepsis require extensive social&#xD;
      attention. Continuous research and input are needed to explore predicting factors and&#xD;
      effective interventions to improve the outcome and help patients and their families return to&#xD;
      normal life,to reduce the social burden.&#xD;
