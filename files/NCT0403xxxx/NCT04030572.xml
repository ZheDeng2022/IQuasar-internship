  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This will be a Phase 1, open label study of the pharmacokinetics (PK) and pharmacodynamics&#xD;
      (PD) of clonidine, an alpha-2 adrenergic (a2a) agonist, in healthy volunteers. The primary&#xD;
      aim is to show that the drug regimen is safe and reasonably well tolerated. The secondary aim&#xD;
      is to demonstrate that safety can be monitored with home health devices.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Subjects who screen in will participate in a drug-free lead-in period of one week duration.&#xD;
      Then, the drug test article, clonidine HCl, 0.1 mg tabs, will be administered once daily by&#xD;
      mouth at bedtime for one week. Steady-state PK will be measured on Day 8 post-drug with a&#xD;
      single blood draw of 10 mL. This will be followed by a one week wash out period. During each&#xD;
      of these three different one-week periods, sleep quality will be monitored nightly with a&#xD;
      blue tooth and wireless enabled, wearable sleep tracker. Vital signs (VSs) will be monitored&#xD;
      daily at home with a blue tooth and wireless enabled blood pressure machine. VSs and&#xD;
      electrocardiograms (ECGs) will be measured before drug on Day (-7) and Day 1. Repeat&#xD;
      measurements will be made during clinic visits on Day 2, Day 8, and Day 16.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings should show that there is, or is not, a PD effect produced by this rather low&#xD;
      dose of drug administered for a relatively short period of time. Showing a PD effect at a&#xD;
      safe and reasonably well tolerated dose would qualify this drug dosing regimen as a&#xD;
      pharmacological challenge in future studies.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  able to give informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  age 18-89&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjectively healthy and, in the opinion of the investigators, likely to be compliant&#xD;
             with the drug regimen and the schedule of follow up visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Normal hemodynamic function. Systolic blood pressure and pulse must be higher than 120&#xD;
             mmHg and 60 beats per minute while sitting. At the discretion of the investigators,&#xD;
             athletic people who are in exceptionally robust condition may be enrolled if their&#xD;
             systolic blood pressure and pulse are higher than 100 mmHg and 50 beats per minute&#xD;
             while sitting.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Unremarkable electrocardiograms with PR intervals of less than 200 mSec and QT&#xD;
             intervals corrected with Fridericia's method (QTcF) of less than 440 mSec.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No concurrent medications with the exception of p.r.n. NSAIDS, which must be&#xD;
             discontinued one week prior to the lead-in period, and avoided for the next three&#xD;
             weeks while on study (the one week lead-in period, one week on drug period, and one&#xD;
             week washout period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing and able to refrain from abusing any recreational drugs, including marijuana&#xD;
             because of its sleep effects, and drink less than one unit of alcoholic beverages per&#xD;
             day starting one week prior to the lead-in period, and avoided for the next three&#xD;
             weeks while on study (the one week lead-in period, one week on drug period, and one&#xD;
             week washout period).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain from donating blood while during the month of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain from participating in any other research study that requires taking&#xD;
             medication during the month of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willing to refrain from being vaccinated during the month of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of allergy to clonidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of multiple hypersensitivity reactions, as indicated by allergies to multiple&#xD;
             medications, foods, and seasonal pollen.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or physical examination suggestive of a condition, disorder, or disease that&#xD;
             could represent a contra-indication to taking an antihypertensive. The relative&#xD;
             contraindications to clonidine listed in the package insert under the section on&#xD;
             precautions will be exclusionary in this study. They include subjects with coronary&#xD;
             artery insufficiency syndromes, histories of myocardial infarction, cardiac conduction&#xD;
             abnormalities, cerebrovascular disease, and chronic renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women who are pregnant or breast feeding will not be eligible to participate in the&#xD;
             study, as clonidine is classified as a Class C risk to a fetus. (In fact, there is a&#xD;
             safety signal in pregnant animal models that justifies exclusion, even if the signal&#xD;
             is weak.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History or physical examination suggestive of a condition, disorder, or disease that&#xD;
             could affect the adsorption, distribution, metabolism or excretion of the study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Positive urine toxicology screen for recreational drugs, other than cannabis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) as a child or a residual&#xD;
             disorder as an adult, because safety, tolerability, and patient acceptability have&#xD;
             already been shown in these populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects may not be a member of a vulnerable population.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not have taken any controlled medications, including other study drugs, in the&#xD;
             last 30 days or for 10 half-lives, whichever is longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not have donated blood in the 30 days prior to the start of the lead-in period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not have participated in research administering drugs in the last 30 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  May not have been vaccinated in the 30 days prior to the start of the lead-in period.&#xD;
