      Comparison of water-perfused (WP) and air-charged (AC) catheters for invasive urodynamic&#xD;
      investigation (UDI) regarding consistency, features and artifacts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      UDI is the gold standard to assess refractory lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS), i.e. to&#xD;
      detect and specify lower urinary tract dysfunction (LUTD). Therefore, UDI findings lead to&#xD;
      diagnosis and decision-making for further non-invasive and invasive therapies. For UDI&#xD;
      pressure recordings, the use of WP catheters is recommended by the International Continence&#xD;
      Society (ICS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently AC catheters have been marked for pressure recording as an alternative to WP&#xD;
      catheters. However, the number of comparative studies is very limited. Nevertheless, since&#xD;
      release, AC catheters have gained popularity due to their omnidirectional detection of&#xD;
      pressure, and claimed reduction in movement artefacts (due to weight-less air column vs&#xD;
      weighted water column), lack of external reference level, and ease of set-up/use. Still,&#xD;
      there is debate whether AC catheters are an acceptable alternative to fluid-filled lines for&#xD;
      measuring intravesical and intra-abdominal pressure in UDI. Based on the available&#xD;
      literature, an appropriate conclusion, whether both systems can be used as equivalents and&#xD;
      interchangeably, cannot be drawn.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, the investigators compare both systems regarding consistency, features and&#xD;
      artifacts.&#xD;
