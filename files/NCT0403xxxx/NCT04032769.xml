    <textblock>
      Because a missed PE could be potentially lethal, several researches reported that PE is both&#xD;
      overinvestigated and overdiagnosed. The diagnostic gold standard for PE is the computed&#xD;
      tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and has been shown to have clear risks and other&#xD;
      downsides. To limit the use of CTPA, two rules were recently reported to be safe to exclude&#xD;
      PE: the PERC rule and the YEARS rule. PERC is an 8 item block of clinical criteria that has&#xD;
      recently been validated to safely exclude PE in low risk patients. YEARS is a clinical rule&#xD;
      that allow to raise the threshold of D-dimer for the order of CTPA. However, whether a&#xD;
      modified diagnostic algorithm that includes these two rules combined could safely reduce&#xD;
      imaging study use in the ED is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a non-inferiority, cluster cross-over randomized, international trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each center will be randomized on the sequence of period intervention: 4 months intervention&#xD;
      (MOdified Diagnostic Strategy: MODS) followed by 4 months control (usual care), or 4 months&#xD;
      control followed by 4 months intervention with 1 month of &quot;wash-out&quot; between the two periods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All centers will recruit adult emergency patients with a suspicion of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group (usual strategy), patients will be tested for D-dimer, followed if&#xD;
      positive by a CTPA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the intervention group (MODS) :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will be tested with quantitative D-dimer. The MODS work-up will be&#xD;
      based on YEARS rule :&#xD;
&#xD;
      - If all YEARS criteria are absent, the threshold of D-Dimer for ordering a CTPA will be&#xD;
      raised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at least one criterion of YEARS is present, then the D-dimer threshold for ordering a CTPA&#xD;
      will be as usual.&#xD;

      The diagnosis of Pulmonary Embolism (PE) is a crucial matter in the Emergency Department&#xD;
      (ED). Because a missed PE could be potentially lethal, several researches reported that PE is&#xD;
      both overinvestigated and overdiagnosed. The diagnostic gold standard for PE is the computed&#xD;
      tomographic pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) and has been shown to have clear risks (allergic&#xD;
      reaction, acute renal failure, delayed solid tumor) and other downsides such as prolonged ED&#xD;
      stay and increased cost. To limit the use of CTPA, two rules were recently reported to be&#xD;
      safe to exclude PE: the PERC rule and the YEARS rule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PERC is an 8 item block of clinical criteria that has recently been validated to safely&#xD;
      exclude PE in low risk patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      YEARS is a clinical rule that allow to raise the threshold of D-dimer for the order of CTPA.&#xD;
      However, whether a modified diagnostic algorithm that includes these two rules combined could&#xD;
      safely reduce imaging study use in the ED is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to assess the safety of a modified diagnostic strategy&#xD;
      (MODS) with the YEARS for patients in whom PE was not excluded by PERC score in the ED.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary endpoint is the failure percentage of the diagnostic strategy, defined as a&#xD;
      diagnosed thrombo-embolic event at 3 month follow-up (either a PE or a deep venous&#xD;
      thrombosis), among patients in whom PE has been initially ruled out.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes try to assess the efficacy of the modified diagnostic strategy (MODS)&#xD;
      in reducing order of irradiative imaging studies, ED length of stay, undue onset of&#xD;
      anticoagulation regimen, hospital admission, hospital readmission, and mortality at 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the efficacy of the modified diagnostic strategy to reduce overall 3-months total&#xD;
      cost.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CTPA or V/Q scan&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anticoagulant therapy administration&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Length of stay in the ED (hours)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Admission to the hospital following ED visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  All causes re hospitalization at 3 months,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Death from all causes at 3 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Diagnosed pulmonary embolism at 3 month follow-up excluding the isolated sub-segmental&#xD;
           pulmonary embolism, among patients in whom PE has been initially ruled out&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PEPS score&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  3 months total cost and cost effectiveness&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the Modified diagnostic strategy (MODS), All included patients will be tested with&#xD;
      quantitative D-dimer. The MODS work-up strategy will be based on YEARS rule, that included&#xD;
      three criteria (hemoptysis, signs of DVT, PE is the most likely diagnosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
      - If all YEARS criteria are absent, the threshold of D-Dimer for ordering a CTPA will be&#xD;
      raised at 1000 ng/ml.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If at least one criterion of YEARS is present, then the D-dimer threshold for ordering a CTPA&#xD;
      will be as usual (500 ng/ml, or agex10 for patients aged 50 and over)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group control :&#xD;
&#xD;
      All included patients will be tested with D-Dimer, the threshold for ordering a CTPA will be&#xD;
      as usual (conventional age-adjusted threshold at 500 ng/ml, or agex10 for patients aged 50&#xD;
      and over).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safely reducing the use of CTPA would be beneficial for the patients, by limiting their risk&#xD;
      of associated adverse events and overdiagnosis of PE, and will also reduce their length of&#xD;
      stay in the ED, which is associated with better outcomes. Furthermore, reducing supplemental&#xD;
      investigations for patients with suspicion of PE may also reduce the cost of ED visits, which&#xD;
      would be of great benefit in the context of increasingly resource stretched healthcare&#xD;
      services.&#xD;

    <description>the threshold of D-dimer will depend on the YEARS rule (MODS strategy):&#xD;
If all the three items of YEARS are negative (i.e. No hemoptysis, No clinical sign of deep venous thrombosis and PE is not the most likely diagnosis), then the threshold of D-dimer will be raised at 1000 ng/ml.&#xD;
If at least one item of YEARS is positive, then the threshold will remain unchanged (&quot;&gt;500 ng/ml&quot; for patients aged &lt; 50 and &quot;&gt; agex10&quot; for patients aged 50 and over).&#xD;
A positive result of D-dimer and the absence of other obvious cause for PE will mandate a CTPA, or V/Q scan if CTPA is contra-indicated.&#xD;
A negative result of D-dimer will rule out PE.</description>
