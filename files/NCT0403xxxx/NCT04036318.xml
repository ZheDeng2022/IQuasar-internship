  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sexually transmitted infections (STI) are important causes of reproductive health morbidity&#xD;
      and mortality, and have long been implicated as major co-factors in the sexual transmission&#xD;
      of HIV. Both ulcerative and non-ulcerative STI have been found to be strongly associated with&#xD;
      HIV in cross-sectional and prospective studies and hence STI prevention and care are&#xD;
      important aspects of HIV prevention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Periodic Presumptive Treatment of STIS (PPT) where risk populations are presumptively treated&#xD;
      with a single dose of Azithromycin+Cefixime in regular intervals of 3 months has been shown&#xD;
      to be effective in reducing STI prevalence at population level and has recently been&#xD;
      integrated into the National STI guidelines of Tanzania. The USAID funded Sauti program will&#xD;
      be one of the first to implement these new guidelines and roll out PPT in high risk&#xD;
      populations in selected regions in Tanzania. This study will evaluate the impact of PPT as&#xD;
      delivered by the Sauti program on prevalence of STIs in men who have sex with men and female&#xD;
      sex workers in Dar es Salaam and Shinyanga respectively.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This intervention linked study evaluates the impact of PPT on population level in FSW and MSM&#xD;
      in Tanzania (Shinyanga and Dar es Salaam respectively). It is expected that PPT will reduce&#xD;
      laboratory diagnosed STIs by 50% in the population after a roll out of 6 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This evaluation uses a cross-sectional venue-based sampling design. Three rounds of cross&#xD;
      sectional data collection will be undertaken for MSM in Dar es Salaam and FSW in Shinyanga at&#xD;
      three months intervals (baseline, 3 months and 6 months). The change in prevalence will be&#xD;
      measured between baseline and 6 months assessments. The interim assessment will be used to&#xD;
      refine the sample size. Study participants will be recruited in venues frequented by FSW&#xD;
      (Shinyanga) and MSM (Dar es Salaam) in wards where Sauti operates. Respondents will be&#xD;
      continuously sampled from all venues until sample size is reached. In each round of data&#xD;
      collection, study participants will undergo physical examination, biological specimen&#xD;
      collection, laboratory and HIV tests and a questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STI prevalence in MSM and FSWs will be measured during each survey and laboratory-confirmed&#xD;
      STI prevalence (gonorrhoea, chlamydia, syphilis) will be assessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, effect on STI prevalence in the bridge population will be measured by&#xD;
      retrospective analysis of routine data for the prevalence of syndromic STIs among the mining&#xD;
      population in Shinyanga, as collected in the context of the Sauti program mobile biomedical&#xD;
      services (CBHTC+), which will visit the major mines in Shinyanga prior PPT implementation and&#xD;
      after each survey. By the term major mines, we mean mines with large population of male mine&#xD;
      workers (between 1000-2000 male mine workers) at higher risk of HIV rather than mines with&#xD;
      modern mining infrastructure.&#xD;
