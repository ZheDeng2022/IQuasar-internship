  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to investigate, at first, safety and tolerability of a novel liquid&#xD;
      vaccine formulation named MV-ZIKA-RSP, in healthy adults aged 18 to 55 years&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is an observer-blinded, block-randomized, dose-finding, phase I trial, comparing&#xD;
      different dose levels of MV-ZIKA-RSP to evaluate the safety, tolerability, and&#xD;
      immunogenicity, of this novel ZIKA-RSP vaccine. Placebo (physiological saline solution) will&#xD;
      be applied to blind the different treatment schedules.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the screening procedures, 48 healthy male and female volunteers aged 18-55 years will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to one of four treatment groups (A, B, C or D). Participants will be&#xD;
      assessed for immunogenicity on days 0, 28 and 56 (treatment period), as confirmed by the&#xD;
      presence of functional anti-zika-rsp antibodies determined by (PRNT50) and by ELISA, at the&#xD;
      same time safety will be also assessed. After the treatment period, participants will be&#xD;
      called by phone (day 182) for evaluation of safety follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator and site personnel assessing AEs, all participants, as well as one of the&#xD;
      sponsor's representatives involved in the monitoring and conduct of the study will be blinded&#xD;
      to which vaccine was administered. Only the unblinded monitor, site personnel performing&#xD;
      randomization, preparation and administration of IMP will be unblinded.&#xD;
