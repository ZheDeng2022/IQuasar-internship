      Background: Gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) is a worldwide prevalent gastrointestinal&#xD;
      disorder which has negative impacts on quality of life, health and economy. The aims of this&#xD;
      study were to assess the prevalence of GERD among college students in southwestern Saudi&#xD;
      Arabia and to evaluate its personal, academic and stress correlates Materials and Methods:&#xD;
      Through a cross-sectional study design, a self-reported questionnaire was distributed between&#xD;
      a representative sample of students in health and non-health care colleges in southwestern&#xD;
      Saudi Arabia. The questionnaire included data for personal characteristics, academic study,&#xD;
      and Arabic versions of GERD questionnaire (GerdQ) and Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale.&#xD;

      Study design and setting A cross-sectional study was carried out in both male and female&#xD;
      campuses of King Khalid University (KKU) during the academic year 2018-2019. The University&#xD;
      is located in Aseer region in the southwestern part of Saudi Arabia. The area of Aseer region&#xD;
      is about 80.000 square kilometers occupied with more than 1.6 million people. The university&#xD;
      comprise 5 health colleges and 24 non-health colleges with a total number of 60.312 male and&#xD;
      female students in the academic year 2014-2015.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Target population Students in Health and non-health care colleges in KKU were the target&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size and sampling method Sample size was estimated by using Epi info program version&#xD;
      7.2 with the anticipated prevalence of GERD symptoms among college students 23.8% [6], 95%&#xD;
      confidence level and acceptable margin of error of 2.5%. The calculated cluster size was 1113&#xD;
      students. To account for the possibility of non-response, 1200 students were targeted from&#xD;
      each of health and non-health care colleges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All health care colleges were included in the study. They were colleges of medicine,&#xD;
      pharmacy, dentistry, nursing and applied medical science. Five non- health care colleges were&#xD;
      selected by random method. They were colleges of education, science, humanities,&#xD;
      administrative and financial sciences, and languages and translation. Participants were&#xD;
      selected through stratified cluster sampling technique. Within each college, students were&#xD;
      stratified by academic level. Within each level a cluster (section or study group) was&#xD;
      selected. When possible, all registered students within each cluster were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study tool and data collection A self-reported questionnaire was distributed personally by&#xD;
      medical students-during their training in community medicine course- between the&#xD;
      participants. The questionnaire includes the following sections: a) personal data such as,&#xD;
      age sex, marital status, smoking status and family income; b) academic data which include,&#xD;
      name of college, academic level and Grade point average (GPA); c) Arabic version of GERD&#xD;
      questionnaire (GerdQ)[10]; d) Arabic version of Cohen's Perceived Stress Scale (PSS) [8].&#xD;
&#xD;
      All incomplete questionnaires were excluded. Arabic version of GERD questionnaire (GerdQ)&#xD;
      GerdQ is a valid questionnaire used to explore the probaility of GERD. It is consisted of 6&#xD;
      questions as follow: four positive questions to assess GERD symptoms (heartburn,&#xD;
      regurgitation, sleep disturbance related to heartburn and regurgitation and use of&#xD;
      medications) and two negative questions (epigastric pain and nausea). Each item rated from 0&#xD;
      to 3 depending on the rate of symptoms over the previous week. GERD was detected with a total&#xD;
      score value of 8 or more [10]. Score value of 8 or more plus total score value of 3 or more&#xD;
      for the impact questions (sleep disturbance and use of medications) indicted GERD with impact&#xD;
      on daily life. The Arabic version of GerdQ was developed and validated for use among Arabic&#xD;
      speakers [11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis The gained data were entered, revised, and analyzed using SPSS, version 22&#xD;
      software package. Grading of PSS into low, moderate and high was according to Cohen's et al&#xD;
      [12]. Crude odds ratio (cOR) and adjusted odds ratio (aOR) were calculated using univariate&#xD;
      and multivariable logistic regression analysis respectively. Their 95% confidence intervals&#xD;
      (95% CIs) were used to identify significant factors associated with GERD among students.&#xD;
