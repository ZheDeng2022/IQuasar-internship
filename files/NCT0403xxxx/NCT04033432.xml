    <textblock>
      The purpose of this phase II, single-arm, open-label, three center study is to evaluate the&#xD;
      efficacy, safety, and tolerability of sEphB4-HSA in patients with mCRPC (metastatic&#xD;
      castration-resistant prostate cancer). The study drug, sEphB4-HAS, is a form of protein that&#xD;
      has not been approved for sale by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The&#xD;
      study drug prevents tumor cells from multiplying and blocks several compounds that promote&#xD;
      the growth of blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the efficacy of recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein (sEphB4-HSA) in patients&#xD;
      with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) as measured by confirmed&#xD;
      prostate specific antigen (PSA) response rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. The safety and tolerability of sEphB4-HSA in patients with mCRPC according to National&#xD;
      Cancer Institute (NCI) Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) version (v)&#xD;
      5.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess the time to PSA progression. III. To assess overall response rate in patients&#xD;
      with measurable disease using Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST) 1.1 (soft&#xD;
      tissue) and Prostate Cancer Working Group 3 (PCWG3) (bone) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To assess radiological progression free survival (rPFS) using RECIST 1.1 (soft tissue)&#xD;
      and PCWG3 (bone) criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore molecular changes associated with EphB4 and ephrinB2 expression in tumor&#xD;
      specimens (primary and/or metastatic tissue).&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore association of response with molecular biomarkers including aberrations in the&#xD;
      PI3K pathway, MYC and TP53.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To assess immune cell infiltration of tumors in biopsies. IV. To assess circulating&#xD;
      immune changes associated with treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive recombinant EphB4-HSA fusion protein intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on&#xD;
      day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days for cycles 1-6 and then every 21 days for subsequent&#xD;
      cycles. Patients may continue to receive sEphB4-HSA treatment until no longer clinically&#xD;
      benefiting (PCWG3), unacceptable toxicity, treatment delay &gt;= 4 weeks, or prohibitive&#xD;
      illness/change in patient?s condition, or patient decides to withdraw from study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 30 days and then every 6&#xD;
      months for up to 1 year.&#xD;
