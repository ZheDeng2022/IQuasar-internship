      This study evaluates the feasibility of walnuts supplementation among population of high CVD&#xD;
      risks over a period of 6 months. 70 participants will be controls receiving non-edible gifts.&#xD;
      70 participants will be given 30 grams of walnuts everyday and 70 participants will be given&#xD;
      60 grams of walnuts a day.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Increased consumption of nuts improves the levels of lipid risk factors associated with&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease and consistently relates to lower risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD)&#xD;
      in prospective cohort studies. The estimates of health effects and potential population&#xD;
      benefits of increased consumption of nuts are based mostly on observational data and there&#xD;
      remains considerable uncertainty about whether higher intake of nuts will actually reduce&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes. To address this uncertainty will require a well-conducted,&#xD;
      adequately powered, large-scale, randomised control trial that tests the causal relationship&#xD;
      between nut intake and the risk of cardiovascular diseases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hereby designed a 6-month walnut supplementation trial in a rural area of China with high&#xD;
      rates of CVD, to obtain data to support and help to refine the design of a future long-term&#xD;
      large RCT testing the effect of nut supplementation on CVD risk. The main objectives of the&#xD;
      current trial are to assess the acceptability and adherence to two different doses of walnut&#xD;
      supplementation (30 and 60 grams per day). The exploratory objectives are to determine the&#xD;
      effects of walnut supplementation on cardiovascular risk factors including blood lipids,&#xD;
      fasting glucose, and body weight.&#xD;
