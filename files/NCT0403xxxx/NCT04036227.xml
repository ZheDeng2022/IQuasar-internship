  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a First in Human (FIH), double-blinded, parallel-group, randomised,&#xD;
      placebo-controlled study designed to evaluate the safety, tolerability, PK and PD of single&#xD;
      and multiple ascending oral doses of GS-248 in healthy subjects.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Part I (SAD); In the SAD part of the study, single oral doses of GS-248 will be administered&#xD;
      in 6 sequential cohorts, each consisting of 8 subjects randomised to receive either GS 248 or&#xD;
      placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The first 2 subjects in each cohort will be dosed in a sentinel&#xD;
      fashion; 1 subject will receive GS-248 and the other will receive placebo as randomised. The&#xD;
      subjects will be carefully monitored by clinical staff during and after dosing. Vital signs&#xD;
      and ECG will be checked at regular intervals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part II (MAD); The MAD part of the study will explore multiple ascending dosing of GS-248&#xD;
      administered for 10 days. The proposed starting dose is 25 mg/day. However, the starting dose&#xD;
      as well as subsequent dose levels may be adjusted based on safety and PK evaluation in&#xD;
      previous cohorts. GS-248 will be administered in 4 sequential cohorts, each of 8 subjects&#xD;
      randomised to receive either GS 248 or placebo in a 3:1 ratio. The subjects will be carefully&#xD;
      monitored by clinical staff during and after dosing. Vital signs and ECG will be checked at&#xD;
      regular intervals.&#xD;
