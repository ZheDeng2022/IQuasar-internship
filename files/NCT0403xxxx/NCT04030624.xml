  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to evaluate a program that involves remote electronic&#xD;
      monitoring of vital signs and symptoms of patients with gastrointestinal cancer who were&#xD;
      recently hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital or presented to the oncology clinic&#xD;
      for an unplanned, urgent visit.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with gastrointestinal cancer often experience troublesome symptoms and side effects&#xD;
      related to the cancer and its treatment. Unfortunately, patients commonly require hospital&#xD;
      admission or urgent clinic visits to help manage uncontrolled symptoms. For this study, the&#xD;
      investigators seek to determine if a program that entails remote electronic monitoring may&#xD;
      improve the overall care experience of patients with gastrointestinal cancer who have urgent&#xD;
      care needs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are asking the participants to take part in this research study because the&#xD;
      participants are currently hospitalized at Massachusetts General Hospital or recently&#xD;
      presented to the oncology clinic for an urgent visit, and are receiving treatment at the&#xD;
      Cancer Center. The goal of this study is to test a program that involves remote electronic&#xD;
      monitoring of vital signs and patient-reported health outcomes. This study is a pilot study,&#xD;
      and the investigators are evaluating the feasibility of delivering the program, the&#xD;
      acceptability and satisfaction with the program, changes in the quality of life and symptoms&#xD;
      of patients who receive the program, as well as the frequency of urgent hospital visits while&#xD;
      the patient is in the program.&#xD;

    <description>The Remote Electronic Patient Monitoring intervention will entail monitoring of vital sign data and patient reported assessments to address and manage any concerning issues identified.&#xD;
The Remote Patient Monitoring system uses algorithms that can indicate when patient vitals and patient-reported outcomes have changed.&#xD;
Automatic patient surveys are sent to the patient with results displayed on the clinician user interface (i.e., dashboard) on a computer located in the clinical area.&#xD;
Qualitative interviews with patient participants and their oncology clinicians using a semi-structured interview guide will be conducted.</description>

    <description>The Remote Patient Monitoring intervention is a remote monitoring system intended for use by healthcare professionals for the collection of physiological data in home and healthcare settings. Patient information is displayed on a computer located at the medical institution. Throughout the day, patient data from the remote monitoring system are presented on the clinician user interface (e.g., temperature, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration rate). Data are transmitted from sensors to the patient's smart phone.</description>
