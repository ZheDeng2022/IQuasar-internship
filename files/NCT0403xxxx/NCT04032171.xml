  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of evobrutinib administered orally twice&#xD;
      daily versus Interferon-beta-1a (Avonex®), once a week intramuscularly in participants with&#xD;
      Relapsing Multiple Sclerosis (RMS).&#xD;

  <overall_status>Terminated</overall_status>
  <why_stopped>
    Following analysis of open label extension (OLE) data from RMS phase 2 study (MS200527- 0086),&#xD;
    it was determined that a change in active comparator warranted in phase 3 RMS comprised of&#xD;
    trial MS200527-0074. Consequently, this trial terminated early.&#xD;

    <measure>Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR)</measure>
    <time_frame>At Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The annualized relapse rate at 96 weeks was to be calculated based on qualified relapses. A qualifying relapse is the occurrence of new or worsening neurological symptoms attributable to MS. The relapse should be accompanied by an increase of 0.5 points or more on Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or 2 points increase on one of the Functional System Scores (FSS), or 1 point increase on at least two of the FSS. The increase in FSS scores must be related to the neurological symptoms which were reported as new or worsening.</description>

    <measure>Time to First Occurrence of 12-Week Confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that measures disability in participants with MS. EDSS progression is defined as an increase of 1 point or more from Baseline EDSS score when the Baseline score is 5.0 or less, and an increase of 0.5 points or more when the Baseline score is 5.5 or greater. Time to first occurrence of 12-week confirmed EDSS progression is defined as the time from randomization to the first EDSS progression event that was confirmed at a regularly scheduled visit at least 12 weeks later.</description>

    <measure>Time to First Occurrence of 24-Week Confirmed Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) Progression</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 96 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that measures disability in participants with MS. EDSS progression is defined as an increase of 1 point or more from Baseline EDSS score when the Baseline score is 5.0 or less, and an increase of 0.5 points or more when the Baseline score is 5.5 or greater. Time to first occurrence of 24-week confirmed EDSS progression is defined as the time from randomization to the first EDSS progression event that was confirmed at a regularly scheduled visit at least 24 weeks later.</description>

    <measure>Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (PF) Short Form Score at Week 96</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, Week 96</time_frame>
    <description>The PROMIS PF Short Form is specific to measuring the physical function domain of MS patients, with each item on the form scored on a T-score metric. Higher scores indicate higher PF. Change from baseline at Week 96 is the difference between the PROMIS PF scores at 96 weeks and at baseline.</description>

    <description>The PROMIS Fatigue Short Form is specific to measuring the fatigue domain of MS patients, with each item on the form scored on a T-score metric. Higher scores indicate higher fatigue. Change from baseline at Week 96 is the difference between the PROMIS Fatigue scores at 96 weeks and at baseline.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs), Serious TEAEs and Adverse Events of Special Interest (AESIs)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 254 days</time_frame>
    <description>An AE is any untoward medical occurrence in a participant administered a pharmaceutical product, regardless of causal relationship with this treatment. Therefore, an AE can be any unfavorable and unintended sign (including an abnormal laboratory finding), symptom, or disease temporally associated with the use of a medicinal product, regardless if it is considered related to the medicinal product. TEAE is an AE that started after study drug treatment; or if the event was continuous from baseline &amp; was serious, related to investigational medicinal product (IMP), or resulted in death, discontinuation, interruption or reduction of study therapy. TEAEs included both serious and non-serious TEAEs. AESIs included liver AEs (possible drug-induced, non-infectious, non-alcoholic and immune-mediated) infections (serious and opportunistic infections), lipase and amylase elevation, and seizure.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) Based on Severity According to National Cancer Institute-Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events Version 4.03 (NCI-CTCAE v4.03)</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline up to 254 days</time_frame>
    <description>Adverse event (AE) was defined as any untoward medical occurrence in a participant, which does not necessarily have causal relationship with treatment. A serious AE was defined as an AE that resulted in any of the following outcomes: death; life threatening; persistent/significant disability/incapacity; initial or prolonged in participant hospitalization; congenital anomaly/birth defect or was otherwise considered medically important. TEAEs included both serious TEAEs and non-serious TEAEs. Severity of TEAEs were graded using NCI CTCAE v4.03 toxicity grades, as follows: Grade 1= Mild; Grade 2 = Moderate; Grade 3 = Severe; Grade 4 = Life-threatening and Grade 5 = Death. Number of participants with TEAEs based on severity were reported.</description>

      <pre_assignment_details>This study was to be conducted in 2 periods; double blind period and open label extension period. However, due to early termination of the study, the sponsor decided not to conduct the open label extension period. A total of 950 participants were planned to be included in 1:1 to treatment with evobrutinib or Avonex, however only 1 participant was enrolled in evobrutinib due to early termination.</pre_assignment_details>

        <title>Annualized Relapse Rate (ARR)</title>
        <description>The annualized relapse rate at 96 weeks was to be calculated based on qualified relapses. A qualifying relapse is the occurrence of new or worsening neurological symptoms attributable to MS. The relapse should be accompanied by an increase of 0.5 points or more on Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), or 2 points increase on one of the Functional System Scores (FSS), or 1 point increase on at least two of the FSS. The increase in FSS scores must be related to the neurological symptoms which were reported as new or worsening.</description>

        <description>EDSS is an ordinal scale in half-point increments that measures disability in participants with MS. EDSS progression is defined as an increase of 1 point or more from Baseline EDSS score when the Baseline score is 5.0 or less, and an increase of 0.5 points or more when the Baseline score is 5.5 or greater. Time to first occurrence of 12-week confirmed EDSS progression is defined as the time from randomization to the first EDSS progression event that was confirmed at a regularly scheduled visit at least 12 weeks later.</description>

          <title>Change From Baseline in Patient Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Physical Function (PF) Short Form Score at Week 96</title>
          <description>The PROMIS PF Short Form is specific to measuring the physical function domain of MS patients, with each item on the form scored on a T-score metric. Higher scores indicate higher PF. Change from baseline at Week 96 is the difference between the PROMIS PF scores at 96 weeks and at baseline.</description>
