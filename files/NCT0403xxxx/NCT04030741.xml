      Gold Standard treatment of appendicitis is appendectomy but non-operative treatment of&#xD;
      non-perforated appendicitis with antibiotics is also under trial. Although appendectomy is&#xD;
      curative but it is an invasive procedure done under general anesthesia with different risks&#xD;
      and complications during and after operation, leading to disturbance of child daily routines&#xD;
      and activities. Reported rates of perioperative complications are from 5% - 10%, with serious&#xD;
      complications occurring in 1% to 7% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children presenting with acute (&lt;2 days) right iliac fossa pain with pediatric appendicitis&#xD;
      score &gt;7, with none of the following on ultrasonography: abscess formation, or loss of the&#xD;
      echogenic sub-mucosal layer of the appendix or presence of an appendicolith or&#xD;
      periappendiceal fluid collection will be labeled as having appendicitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After diagnosis we divided the patients into two groups.patients in group A will be treated&#xD;
      with antibiotics and appendectomy is done for group B patients.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Acute appendicitis is one of the most common presenting conditions in pediatric emergencies.&#xD;
      It has an estimated lifetime risk of about 8%. Although it commonly occurs in the second&#xD;
      decade of life but 11.4% children are diagnosed with acute appendicitis in the pediatric&#xD;
      emergency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale of my study is that limited local clinical trial is available regarding the&#xD;
      efficacy of non-operative treatment with antibiotics vs operative treatment of acute&#xD;
      non-perforated appendicitis in children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children between 5 and 15 years of age of both genders admitted in the pediatric surgery&#xD;
      emergency with having pediatric appendicitis score (PAS anexure 1) &gt;7 will be included in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the patients inducted in the study will be randomly divided into two groups:&#xD;
      Non-operative treatment (group A) and operative treatment (group B), using computer generated&#xD;
      number. Each patient will be evaluated and relevant data according to the predesigned&#xD;
      questionnaire will be collected and documented. Age, duration of symptoms, body&#xD;
      temperature,C-reactive protein, white blood cell, neutrophil concentrations, Ultrasound&#xD;
      findings and PAS score will be noted at the time of admission. Children in non-operative&#xD;
      treatment group will be given intravenous meropenem (10 mg/kg/dose x IV x TDS) and&#xD;
      metronidazole (20 mg/kg/day divided into 3 doses) for at least 48 hours. Once the child&#xD;
      starts tolerating oral intake and becomes clinically improved, the treatment will be changed&#xD;
      to oral ciprofloxacin (20 mg/kg/day divided into 2 divided doses) and metronidazole (20 mg/kg&#xD;
      × 1 per 24 hours) for another 8 days. Supportive care will be given equally to all the&#xD;
      patients as protocol of treatment with regular vital monitoring. Improvement or development&#xD;
      of complications will be noted. Discharge criteria for both groups will be: afebrile for 24&#xD;
      hours, with or without oral antibiotics, adequate pain relief on oral analgesia assesd by&#xD;
      visual analogue scale ( VAS) scale (anexure 2), tolerating a light diet, and mobile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Failure of non-operative treatment will be defined if any one of the following is seen:&#xD;
      abscess formation or complex peri-appendiceal fluid collection seen on ultrasonography, the&#xD;
      need for surgery (due to worsening of symptoms evaulated by history, physical examination and&#xD;
      repeat ultrasonography) within 48 hours, or recurrence of appendicitis within 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with recurrence of symptoms of appendicitis (right iliac fossa pain with pediatric&#xD;
      appendicitis score &gt;7) after complete resolution previously with non-operated treatment, will&#xD;
      be labeled as Recurrent appendicitis.All the data will be collected on a preformed&#xD;
      questionnaire. Discharge criteria for both the groups will be: afebrile for 24 hours, with or&#xD;
      without oral antibiotics, adequate pain relief on oral analgesia and tolerating a light diet.&#xD;
      Patient will be kept on follow-up in group-A for duration of 3 month to 6 month. Patients&#xD;
      will be kept on follow-up in Outdoor patients department once in a week till 3 months in&#xD;
      group B.&#xD;
