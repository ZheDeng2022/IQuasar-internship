      This study is a non-randomized survey. The aim of the current protocol is to describe how&#xD;
      will be the process to get information about the participant, the questionnaire design and&#xD;
      how was validated and the planned analysis of results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants: Around 150 Down Syndrome people from Cordoba, Malaga y Granada who belong to&#xD;
      The Down Syndrome association and 150 parents, family, tutors, teachers etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Consent process: Before designing the survey, consent was requested from the management team&#xD;
      Down of Córdoba, Malaga and Gradana associations, as well as family members, parents, tutors,&#xD;
      teachers, etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard Operating Procedures: First, RC (author) gathered as much information as possible&#xD;
      about the subject under study and selected the most important topics related to the research&#xD;
      focus. After that, the questionnaire was designed modifying the KidsLife-Down Scale. The&#xD;
      questionnaire will be divided into three parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An introduction to the questionnaire describes the instructions, structure, the reasons for&#xD;
      the study and confidentiality in accordance with the Spanish Organic Law 3/2018 on the&#xD;
      Protection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first part of the questionnaire will assess self-perception from people with Down about&#xD;
      their social skills. The second will evaluate the opinion of this issue from other people who&#xD;
      know them well (at least for six months) and who have the opportunity to observe the person&#xD;
      evaluated for extended periods of time (parents, family, tutors, teachers etc.). Finally, for&#xD;
      the third part, it will be used the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for&#xD;
      the purpose of collecting information about the types of physical activity do in their daily&#xD;
      routines. The questions will be referred to the time they have been physically active in the&#xD;
      last 7 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Second, the questionnaire was sent to the Down Syndrome Association of Córdoba (DSAC) so that&#xD;
      they reviewed the possible mistakes made when defining the questions and validate it. After&#xD;
      that, Down Malaga and Down Granada Association found the questionnaire understandable and&#xD;
      acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Third, they gave the corresponding feedback that served to formulate the questions in the&#xD;
      appropriate way to avoid confusion in the surveyed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The questionnaire will be sent by e-mail to the Cordoba Association and a paper version will&#xD;
      available for participants. From Córdoba, it will be spread to Málaga and Granada&#xD;
      Associations in order it will be distributed among associates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis of results: Estimated outcomes will be percentages of agreement with each answer.&#xD;
      Data from all surveys will be analyzed. The statistical study will be carried out with the&#xD;
      SPSS 24.0 program. The mean value and standard deviation (± SD) of each item will be&#xD;
      calculated on a numerical scale. Statistical analysis will be performed with parametric&#xD;
      tests, t-Student for related samples. The level of statistical significance will be&#xD;
      calculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two of the authors (RC and JC) will analyse de data, and results will be discussed among the&#xD;
      work team.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conducting a pilot test or pre-test before applying the survey will help to detect possible&#xD;
      failures and optimize the results of our survey. Despite its importance, should not consider&#xD;
      the pilot study as a substitute for a careful wording of the questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Report on the survey: Before writing the report, It will be reviewed the data for errors and&#xD;
      inconsistencies. Make sure the data reflects exactly what the survey concludes. The&#xD;
      conclusion will summarize the results.&#xD;
