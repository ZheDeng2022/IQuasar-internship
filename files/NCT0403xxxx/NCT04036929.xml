  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Post-menopausal women aged 40-65 with symptomatic hand osteoarthritis are invited to take&#xD;
      part in this feasibility study. The study's aim is to investigate whether it is acceptable to&#xD;
      women with painful hand OA to take an estrogen-containing therapy, and what is the best way&#xD;
      of collecting some of the information in order to facilitate planning a full size trial. The&#xD;
      investigator's long-term aim is to find out whether giving estrogen-containing therapy to&#xD;
      women after the menopause improves hand OA symptoms.&#xD;
