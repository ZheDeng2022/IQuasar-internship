  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well olaparib with or without tremelimumab works in treating&#xD;
      patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer that has come back (recurrent).&#xD;
      PARPs are proteins that help repair DNA mutations. PARP inhibitors, such as olaparib, can&#xD;
      keep PARP from working, so tumor cells can't repair themselves, and they may stop growing.&#xD;
      Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as tremelimumab, may help the body's immune&#xD;
      system attack the cancer, and may interfere with the ability of tumor cells to grow and&#xD;
      spread. Giving olaparib and tremelimumab together may work better than olaparib alone in&#xD;
      treating patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine whether olaparib plus tremelimumab has adequate safety in the study&#xD;
      population. (Safety Lead-in Trial Components) II. To compare the progression-free survival&#xD;
      (PFS) duration of olaparib monotherapy versus olaparib plus tremelimumab in women with&#xD;
      recurrent, platinum sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal, or fallopian tube cancer. (Phase&#xD;
      II Trial Component)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To compare the overall response rate (ORR) by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors&#xD;
      (RECIST) 1.1 in women with recurrent, platinum sensitive ovarian, primary peritoneal or&#xD;
      fallopian tube cancer treated with either olaparib monotherapy or olaparib plus tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To compare the overall survival (OS) of women with recurrent, platinum sensitive ovarian,&#xD;
      primary peritoneal or fallopian tube cancer treated with either olaparib monotherapy or&#xD;
      olaparib plus tremelimumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To explore whether conditions in the tumor microenvironment (as measured by gene&#xD;
      expression signature in archived tumor samples) identify patients that benefit from combined&#xD;
      olaparib and tremelimumab immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To explore whether mutations in BRCA1/2 genes or other evidence of homologous repair&#xD;
      deficiency (HRD+) is prognostic and/or predictive of response to combined olaparib and&#xD;
      tremelimumab immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To explore associations between PD1 expression in the tumor microenvironment and outcome&#xD;
      and changes in circulating leukocyte populations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To explore the correlation between tumor mutational burden and response to olaparib and&#xD;
      tremelimumab immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. To explore the impact of olaparib and tremelimumab versus olaparib monotherapy on&#xD;
      circulating leukocyte subsets via exploration of the immunomodulatory effects of PARP&#xD;
      inhibition and the added impact of CTLA4 blockade in this patient population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. To explore cytokine/chemokine levels using a multiplex immunoassay (Olink) and correlate&#xD;
      these levels with clinical endpoints.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. To use cell-free deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) to assess BRCA mutation status as a&#xD;
      mechanism of acquired resistance to prior PARP inhibition and to compare with treatment&#xD;
      efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM I: Patients receive olaparib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM II: Patients receive olaparib as in Arm I. Patients also receive tremelimumab&#xD;
      intravenously (IV) over 60 minutes on day 1. Cycles of tremelimumab repeat every 4 weeks for&#xD;
      4 doses and then every 12 weeks for up to 2 years total in the absence of disease progression&#xD;
      or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up monthly for 3 months, then&#xD;
      every 3 months for 2 years, followed by every 6 months for 3 years.&#xD;
