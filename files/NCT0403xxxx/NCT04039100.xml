  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Family caregivers are of great importance to patients undergoing treatment for&#xD;
      cancer, but at the same time, caregivers themselves are in great risk of distress and high&#xD;
      symptom burden which affects their quality of life and ability to support the patients.&#xD;
      Within hematology the context of treatment from hospital to home has changed in the past&#xD;
      years placing more responsibilities on caregivers. Finding new ways to support caregivers&#xD;
      within the health care context is important. Psychosocial interventions can enhance emotional&#xD;
      well-being, and peer to peer support model has been found to be effective for patients coping&#xD;
      with cancer. There is a lack of knowledge and evidence of the feasibility and effects of a&#xD;
      peer-to-peer support in caregivers within hematology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims: The study aim to examine the feasibility and safety of Family Caregiver Ambassador&#xD;
      Support in caregivers of newly diagnosed patients with hematological disease, and to examine&#xD;
      if it has an effects on symptoms and psychological wellbeing in both family caregivers and&#xD;
      ambassadors. It is hypothesized that the family caregiver peer to peer support model will&#xD;
      reduce symptoms of burden, reduce concerns and improve emotional and social well-being in&#xD;
      family caregivers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and methods: The study is a one arm feasibility intervention trial with family&#xD;
      caregivers (n=30) and family caregiver ambassadors (N=20). Family Caregivers will be&#xD;
      recruited at the Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet. Family Caregivers will be&#xD;
      partnered with a family caregiver ambassador. The intervention will be carried out in a&#xD;
      12-week period and consist of telephone and/or e-mail contact and face to face meetings with&#xD;
      one follow-up at three months. Both caregiver and ambassador data will be collected at&#xD;
      baseline, post intervention and follow-up 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implication: The study has the potential to be a new model of care incorporated in the&#xD;
      clinical setting to strengthen the support system for caregivers and may likely be tailored&#xD;
      to other cancer groups and caregivers.&#xD;

      Aim: To investigate whether a Family Caregiver Support Model intervention (FAM-CARE) is&#xD;
      feasible and safe, and the impact on the caregiving role and psychosocial wellbeing in family&#xD;
      caregivers of newly diagnosed patients with hematological malignancies, and former caregivers&#xD;
      (family caregiver ambassadors).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design and Methods: This study is a one arm feasibility 12-week intervention trial including&#xD;
      family caregivers (FC) (n=30) and family caregiver ambassadors (FCA)(n=20).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: FC will be recruited at the Department of Hematology, Rigshospitalet (RH).&#xD;
      Eligible family caregivers will receive oral and written information on the project from main&#xD;
      investigator Iben Husted Nielsen (IHN) within four weeks from the patients' diagnosis. Due to&#xD;
      ethical considerations and data protection guidelines patients of eligible caregivers will be&#xD;
      approached by IHN with permission to contact their caregivers before approaching them. Family&#xD;
      caregivers will be given information on the study and the opportunity to raise questions and&#xD;
      concerns and time to consider before enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FCA will be recruited voluntarily from the Department of Hematology, RH and patient&#xD;
      associations (LyLe, Myeloma). The FCA is screened by IHN to assess their appropriateness for&#xD;
      the intervention with interview questions regarding their motivation, availability, and&#xD;
      vulnerability. They will be asked to sign a confidentiality commitment. The FCA will be&#xD;
      informed that they must provide transportation but will receive a monetary incentive for&#xD;
      their participation. Further FCA will be asked to provide information regarding age, gender,&#xD;
      interests, work, education and social conditions and family role in order to match with the&#xD;
      FC. FC and FCA will be matched according to their preferences i.e. patient diagnosis, age,&#xD;
      gender and other factors that might create a mutual understanding and ease communication.&#xD;
      Given the preferences cannot be granted, the FC and FCA will be involved in the decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      FAM CARE Intervention: The intervention consists of individual support provided by the FCA to&#xD;
      the FC, with minimum four face-to-face meetings between the FC and FCA, and with ad hoc&#xD;
      telephone and/or email contact based on the FC's individual needs, and one follow-up&#xD;
      telephone contact at 3 months. The place of meeting and purpose of each face-to-face meeting&#xD;
      is agreed upon by the FC and FCA. The FCA will follow one FC at a time, however at the end of&#xD;
      the 12- week period the FCA can choose to follow a new FC. Upon the first meeting and&#xD;
      expectation agreement will be discussed between the FC and FCA. During the intervention the&#xD;
      FCA will document the frequency of meetings, duration, place, content and quality of the&#xD;
      interactions between FC and FCA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruited FCA's will receive a six-hour group education and training program prior to&#xD;
      interacting with FC. The training program include important and relevant actions and&#xD;
      information on the role as ambassador, communication skills with emphasis on active&#xD;
      listening, and discussion about volunteering and how to maintain appropriate boundaries to&#xD;
      ensure that FCA are aware of their role as listeners who share their experiences only when&#xD;
      solicited by the FC. The training will be organized by IHN and a project nurse and carried&#xD;
      out by IHN, the project nurse and a project psychologist. To secure the safety of FCA during&#xD;
      the intervention they will be offered to attend support meetings organized by IHN and the&#xD;
      project psychologist to process and share their experiences with being an ambassador. Support&#xD;
      meetings will be held every second month and FCA can request individual supervision from the&#xD;
      project psychologist during the intervention. Any severe adverse events will be documented&#xD;
      and acted upon.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures and data collection: Data are collected by patient reported outcome measures&#xD;
      (PROM) as self-reported questionnaires completed by FC electronically prior to intervention,&#xD;
      post intervention (12-weeks) and at 3-month follow-up. PROM is completed by FCA prior to&#xD;
      intervention and at post intervention (12 weeks). Socio-demographic data are collected by&#xD;
      questionnaire. At the end of the 3-months follow-up focus group interviews with FC and FCA&#xD;
      will be conducted on their experiences.&#xD;
