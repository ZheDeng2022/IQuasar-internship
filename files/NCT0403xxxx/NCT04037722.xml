      This study evaluates the cardiovascular effects of adding the ketone body 3-hydroxy butyrate&#xD;
      (3-OHB) to whey protein during human endotoxemia. Further, this study compares cardiovascular&#xD;
      changes during healthy and catabolic conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive isocaloric, isonitrogenous beverages of either whey or 3-OHB+whey&#xD;
      in a randomized crossover design during either healthy (overnight fast) or catabolic&#xD;
      conditions (inflammation/endotoxemia + 36 h fast and bed rest).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      Background: A newly published study found beneficial cardiovascular effects of 3-OHB infusion&#xD;
      in a population with chronic heart failure, significantly increasing cardiac output. Similar&#xD;
      effects on cardiac output were observed in healthy volunteers. These findings pave the way&#xD;
      for 3-OHB as a therapeutic nutritional supplement, since it is well-absorbed during oral&#xD;
      consumption. However, it is unknown whether the cardiovascular effects of 3-OHB persist&#xD;
      during a sepsis-like catabolic state and when administered orally.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim: This study aims to investigate the cardiovascular effects of adding the ketone body&#xD;
      3-hydroxy butyrate (3-OHB) to whey protein during a human disease model, comprising&#xD;
      endotoxemia + bed rest + fast.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Adding the ketone body 3-OHB to an oral protein supplement increases cardiac output&#xD;
           measures&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Catabolic stress (endotoxemia/inflammation + 36 h fast and bed rest) induces&#xD;
           cardiovascular changes compared with healthy conditions (overnight fast)&#xD;
&#xD;
           Interventions:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In a randomized crossover design, eight healthy, lean, young men will undergo either:&#xD;
&#xD;
           i) Healthy conditions (overnight fast) + whey protein^&#xD;
&#xD;
           ii) Catabolic conditions (Inflammation (LPS) + 36-hour fast and bed rest*) + whey&#xD;
           protein^&#xD;
&#xD;
           iii) Catabolic conditions (Inflammation (LPS) + 36-hour fast and bed rest*) + 3-OHB/whey&#xD;
           protein^&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
           *LPS will be administered (1 ng/kg) the day prior to the study together with fast and&#xD;
           bed rest. On the study day LPS (0.5 ng/kg) will be injected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ^Beverages will be isonitrogenous and isocaloric (fat will be added) with 45 g whey&#xD;
           protein + 20 g maltodextrin. Bolus/sip administration will be applied (1/3 bolus, 1/2&#xD;
           sip)&#xD;
&#xD;
           &quot; 50 grams of 3-OHB will be orally administered (1/2 bolus, 1/2 sip)&#xD;
