    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 non-randomized, open-label, parallel cohort, multi-site study to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of renal impairment on the pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of PF-06651600 after multiple oral doses of 50 mg daily. Subjects will be selected and&#xD;
      categorized into normal renal function or renal impairment groups based on their estimated&#xD;
      glomerular filtration rate. Part 1: A total of approximately 16 subjects will be enrolled;&#xD;
      approximately 8 subjects with severe renal impairment and approximately 8 with normal renal&#xD;
      function. After statistical evaluation of results from Part 1, Part 2 may be conducted with&#xD;
      approximately 8 subjects each with moderate and mild renal impairment. The total duration of&#xD;
      participation from Screening visit to Day 11 will be a maximum of 39 days and from Screening&#xD;
      visit to Follow-up/Contact Visit will a maximum of 73 days.&#xD;

    <measure>Number of Participants With Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs)</measure>
    <time_frame>From Screening (Day -28) through and including up to 35 calendar days after the last administration of investigational product, assessed up to 74 days.</time_frame>
    <description>An AE was any untoward medical occurrence in a clinical study participant, temporally associated with the use of study intervention, whether or not considered related to the study intervention. An AE is considered a TEAE is the event started during the effective duration of treatment. All events that started on or after the first dosing day and time/start time, if collected, but before the last dose plus the lag time were flagged as TEAEs. An AE was considered treatment-related if the causality of the AE was assessed to be the investigational product. The causality of AEs was assessed by the investigator using clinical judgment.</description>

    <measure>Number of Participants With Laboratory Abnormalities</measure>
    <time_frame>At Screening Visit 1 and on Days -1, 5, 11 and early termination day.</time_frame>
    <description>Safety laboratory assessments include clinical chemistry, hematology and urinalysis. Serum creatinine was only assessed on Screening visit 2 and on Day 2 and Day 8 for eGFR assessment. The number of participants with laboratory test abnormalities without regard to baseline abnormality was reported.</description>

    <time_frame>At screening, on Day 1, Day 5, Day 11 and early termination/discontinuation.</time_frame>
    <description>Vital signs evaluations included supine blood pressure (BP), pulse rate, and temperature. Criteria for vital signs values included: supine diastolic BP &gt;= 20 mmHg increase from baseline, supine systolic BP &gt;= 30 mmHg increase from baseline, supine diastolic BP &gt;= 20 mmHg decrease from baseline, and supine systolic BP &gt;= 30 mmHg decrease from baseline.</description>
