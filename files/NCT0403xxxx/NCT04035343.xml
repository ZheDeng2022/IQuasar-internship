  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Patients may experience metamorphopsia, or image distortion, after having vitrectomy to&#xD;
      repair their rhegmatogenous retinal detachments especially those with a detached macula.&#xD;
      Retinal displacement, as measured on autofluorescence photography, likely contributes to this&#xD;
      distortion. It is thought that the retina slips inferiorly due to the residual subretinal&#xD;
      fluid shifting as the patient transitions from the supine position intraoperatively to the&#xD;
      sitting up position in the immediate postoperative period. By having the patient immediate&#xD;
      position facedown or according to the retinal break, the risk of slippage is theoretically&#xD;
      decreased.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Rhegmatogenous retinal detachments (RRD) are a sight-threatening condition with an incidence&#xD;
      of approximately 10 per 100 000 people. RRDs can be broadly classified into those with the&#xD;
      macula still attached, and those with the macula detached. Visual prognosis for RRDs with&#xD;
      attached macula tend to be much better than those with detached macula. Pars plana vitrectomy&#xD;
      (PPV) is one of the procedures used to treat RRD. PPV is carried out in the operating room&#xD;
      under regional anesthestic, and often times sedation. The retina is reattached by either&#xD;
      draining the subretinal fluid through a peripheral retinal break, by draining the subretinal&#xD;
      fluid through a posterior retinotomy, or by using a heavier-than-water liquid such as&#xD;
      perfluorocarbon to push out the subretinal fluid. At the end of the surgery, the vitreous&#xD;
      cavity is filled with a substance that will tamponade the retina to the wall of the eye.&#xD;
      Tamponade agents can be temporary, such as sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) and octafluoropropane&#xD;
      (C3F8), or long term, such as silicone oil. After the surgery, patients are usually told to&#xD;
      put their facedown allowing the tamponade agent to keep the macula attached while the&#xD;
      remaining subretinal fluid is reabsorbed by the retinal pigment epithelium. Alternatively,&#xD;
      some surgeons ask that their patients position according to the location of their retinal&#xD;
      breaks with the aim for the buoyant gas bubble to cover the break or breaks. Patients may&#xD;
      experience metamorphopsia, or image distortion, after having their RRD repaired especially&#xD;
      those with a detached macula. Retinal displacement, as measured on autofluorescence&#xD;
      photography, likely contributes to this distortion. Supine positioning in theory covers all&#xD;
      break locations as usually breaks occur in the anterior part of the retina near the vitreous&#xD;
      base. This position has the advantage of being more ergonomic than face down. Depending on&#xD;
      the results, this study might provide evidence for the current standard of care, which is&#xD;
      face down positioning for the first day after vitrectomy for retinal detachment. Or, if&#xD;
      supine positioning demonstrates superiority in reducing the risk of retinal displacement,&#xD;
      patients would be able to maintain a more comfortable position after surgery.&#xD;

    <description>Patients in third arm will be treated with the current standard of care, that is, they will be kept supine in the ophthalmic surgery chair after the completion of their surgery. They will then be taken to the recovery area where, once transferred to the care of the postoperative care unit staff, they will transition to face down positioning. They will maintain this positioning until their first day postoperative visit after which they will position according to the retinal breaks found during surgery.</description>
