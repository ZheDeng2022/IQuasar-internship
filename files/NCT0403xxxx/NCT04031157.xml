  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will compare two groups of patients: a control group of patients treated per the&#xD;
      Standard of Care when prescribed with a medication for their Major depression disorder,&#xD;
      versus a group of patients that used the Predictix Antidepressant tool when prescribed with a&#xD;
      medication for their Major depression disorder by their treating physician. Success will be&#xD;
      measured by the number (proportion) of responders per group.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be comprised of two arms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. PGT arm - Predictix Antidepressant-guided treatment condition&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. SOC (control) arm - Standard of Care condition Eligible subjects will be assigned to one&#xD;
           of the study arms at a 1:1 ratio and will be followed for a period of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An assigned psychiatric expert will review and approve subject's eligibility prior to&#xD;
      entrance to the study, as well as, the medication/s prescribed based on the Predictix report&#xD;
      prior to treatment start.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 12 weeks of follow up , data will be collected at the following timepoints:&#xD;
      Screening, Baseline (start of treatment) and at 4, 8 and 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visits will include the completion of several questionnaires designed to answer the study&#xD;
      objectives, either as self-reported by the patients and/ or by the physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depression scores by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS 16) questionnaire&#xD;
      and evaluation of all safety related endpoints will be analyzed following the completion of&#xD;
      the 12 weeks visit procedures. In case of a change in treatment, as per the treating&#xD;
      physician's decision, a new 12 weeks cycle of data collection will start. Two independent&#xD;
      cycles are permitted per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, retrospective (6 months prior to enrollment) and long-term follow up period data&#xD;
      (12 months post enrollment) will be analyzed, in order to evaluate the device use effect on&#xD;
      patients care outcomes in terms of economic burden and Social impact, on patients, employers,&#xD;
      the health care system and payers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analysis will be based on both the work productivity and activity impairment&#xD;
      questionnaire and the patient's electronic medical data record.&#xD;
