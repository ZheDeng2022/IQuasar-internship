      Single-site prospective interventional study aiming to demonstrate the effect of&#xD;
      spore-forming probiotics on dyspeptic symptoms and blood, saliva and stool parameters in FD&#xD;
      patients with and without acid suppression, compared to placebo.&#xD;

      Prospective randomized placebo-controlled study in 2 parallel FD cohorts (8 weeks) with&#xD;
      open-label extension phase (8 weeks):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cohort 1FD (on-PPI): study procedures at inclusion (1) and after 8 weeks on-PPI+&#xD;
           sporebiotics or placebo (2) followed by 8 weeks on-PPI+ sporebiotics (open label)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  cohort 2FD (off-PPI): study procedures at inclusion (1) and after 8 weeks of&#xD;
           sporebiotics or placebo (2) followed by 8 weeks of sporebiotics (open label)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical outcomes and blood, saliva and stool parameters will be assessed at the beginning&#xD;
      and end of each treatment period (week 0, 8 and 16) with additional questionnaires after 1&#xD;
      month (week 4 and 12).&#xD;

    <description>The Leuven Postprandial Distress Scale (LPDS) is a daily diary assessing the severity of 11 upper gastrointestinal symptoms scored from 0 (none) to 4 (very severe). A difference of 0.7 from baseline for the cardinal PDS symptoms (average of first 3 questions) will be used as a cut-off to determine clinical response by comparing averaged pre-treatment scores with the average score during the last week on treatment with sporebiotics vs. placebo. Only subjects with baseline score &gt;1 (mild) will be included in the intention-to-treat and per-protocol analysis.</description>
