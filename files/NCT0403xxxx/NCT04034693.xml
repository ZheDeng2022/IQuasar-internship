  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigators are testing the efficacy of Smartphone-delivered cognitive behavioral&#xD;
      therapy (CBT) treatment for body dysmorphic disorder (BDD). The investigators hypothesize&#xD;
      that participants receiving app-CBT will have greater improvement in BDD-YBOCS scores than&#xD;
      those in the waitlist condition at treatment endpoint (week 12).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this study is to test the efficacy of a Smartphone-based CBT treatment for&#xD;
      adults with BDD recruited nationally. In a prior study (Clinical Trials Identifier #&#xD;
      NCT03221738), the investigators developed and pilot-tested the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      and preliminary efficacy of a CBT for BDD app in an open pilot trial. The investigators are&#xD;
      now further testing these outcomes in a randomized controlled trial. Eligible subjects (N=&#xD;
      64) will be randomly assigned to 12-weeks of Smartphone-delivered CBT for BDD either&#xD;
      immediately, or after a 12-week long waiting period (50/50 chance).&#xD;

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in BDD severity (BDD-YBOCS) at the end of treatment/waitlist period.</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>The BDD Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (BDD-YBOCS) is the gold-standard, semi-structured clinician-administered assessment of BDD severity. It contains 12 items ranging from 0 to 4, which are summed to generate a total score (range = 0 to 48). Higher scores indicate more severe BDD symptoms. The BDD-YBOCS will be used to assess change in BDD symptoms from baseline to endpoint.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in depression at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on depression (QIDS-SR). The QIDS-SR is a self-report measure of depressive symptoms consisting of 16 scale items with responses ranging from 0 to 3, including one suicide item (item #12). Higher scores correspond with greater depression severity, and the measure is a well-validated, sensitive measure of symptom severity in depression.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in delusionality at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on delusionality, assessed using the Brown Assessment of Beliefs Scale (BABS).The BABS is a semi-structured, clinician-administered interview that assesses delusional thinking related to one's appearance concerns. It contains 7 items ranging from 0-4, which are summed to generate a total score (range= 0-24). Higher scores indicate greater delusionality.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in functional impairment at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on functional impairment (SDS). The SDS uses a Likert scale from 0 (not at all) to 10 (extremely) to assess impairment in occupational, social, and family domains. Higher scores indicate greater impairment.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Difference in quality of life at the end of treatment/waitlist period</measure>
    <time_frame>Endpoint (week 12)</time_frame>
    <description>Participants who receive app-CBT will have greater improvement on quality of life, assessed using The Quality of Life, Enjoyment, and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form (Q-LES-Q). The Q-LES-Q-SF is a self-report measure of subjective quality of life, containing Likert items ranging from 1 (Very Poor) to 5 (Very Good). Total scores are presented as a percentage of the maximum value (i.e., ranging from 0 to 100, with higher scores indicating greater quality of life).</description>

    <description>12-week Smartphone-delivered CBT for BDD. In-person cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an empirically supported treatment for BDD. The app-delivered CBT in this project includes modules such as cognitive skills (e.g., cognitive restructuring, core belief work), behavioral skills (e.g., exposure with ritual prevention), and perceptual retraining/mindfulness skills.</description>
