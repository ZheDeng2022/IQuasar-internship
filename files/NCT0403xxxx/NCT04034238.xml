      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protein mesothelin is found on many kinds of tumors. The drug LMB-100 targets cancer&#xD;
      cells that make this protein. Researchers want to see if LMB-100 combined with another drug&#xD;
      can help people with these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To find a safe dose of LMB-100 plus tofacitinib in people with pancreatic cancer, bile-duct&#xD;
      cancer, and other solid tumors that make mesothelin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with pancreatic cancer, bile-duct cancer, or any other solid tumor&#xD;
      with mesothelin that worsened after treatment or they could not receive standard treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tumor tissue sample. If they do not have a sample, they will have a biopsy.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood and heart tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans and x-rays: They may have a dye injected for the scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take the drugs in up to three 21-day cycles. They will take tofacitinib by&#xD;
      mouth twice a day on days 1-10 of each cycle. They will have LMB-100 injected into the blood&#xD;
      on days 4, 6, and 8 of every cycle. Patients that do not have a medi-port may need to have a&#xD;
      central vein access line placed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take other drugs on the days they receive LMB-100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will repeat screening tests during the study. They may have a biopsy at the&#xD;
      start of the first 2 cycles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If participants must stop the study, they will have a safety visit 3-6 weeks after their last&#xD;
      dose of the study drug. Some participants may then have visits every 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After treatment, participants will be contacted about once a year. They will be asked about&#xD;
      their cancer.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pancreatic cancer is the fourth most common cause of cancer death in the United States,&#xD;
           claiming more than 40,000 lives each year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Incidence nearly equals mortality with just 6% of participants living five years beyond&#xD;
           their diagnosis. Most patients are diagnosed at an advanced stage, but even patients&#xD;
           with early stage disease have a long-term survival of less than 20%.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cholangiocarcinoma is a rare disease and just 3,000 patients are diagnosed with the&#xD;
           extrahepatic form yearly. The median overall survival of patients with advanced disease&#xD;
           receiving standard of care treatment is less than 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Expression of mesothelin (MSLN) in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA) has been&#xD;
           examined in several published studies and ranges from 86 to 100%. Similar incidence of&#xD;
           expression has been observed in extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In addition to pancreatobiliary tumors, many other solid tumor types also express MSLN&#xD;
           such as mesothelioma, colorectal, lung adenocarcinomas, epithelial ovarian, gastric and&#xD;
           triple negative breast cancers, as well as some tumors of squamous cell origin.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LMB-100 and a closely related immunotoxin also targeting MSLN have been studied in&#xD;
           previous Phase 1 clinical studies for mesothelioma and pancreatic cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Results from these studies showed that almost all patients formed anti-drug-antibodies&#xD;
           (ADAs) that neutralized subsequent injection of the product making it ineffective.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tofacitinib is an oral Janus Kinase-1 and -3 (JAK) inhibitor approved by the FDA for the&#xD;
           treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and ulcerative colitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-clinical studies have shown that tofacitinib can prevent the formation of ADAs&#xD;
           against an immunotoxin closely related to LMB-100&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Co-administration of tofacitinib with immunotoxin increased immunotoxin serum half- life&#xD;
           in mice and enhanced anti-tumor efficacy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This clinical trial will investigate whether co-administration of tofacitinib with LMB-&#xD;
           100 can prevent or delay the formation of ADAs and thus allow patients to receive&#xD;
           additional effective cycles of LMB-100.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of the dose escalation phase of this study is to assess the safety&#xD;
           and tolerability of LMB-100 given in combination with tofacitinib to patients with&#xD;
           pancreatic adenocarcinoma, extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma and other mesothelin-&#xD;
           positive solid tumors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The primary objective of the expansion phase of this study is to determine whether co-&#xD;
           administration of tofacitinib delays formation of neutralizing anti-LMB-100 ADAs through&#xD;
           cycle 2 of treatment (as measured by LMB-100 serum drug levels) in patients with&#xD;
           pancreatobiliary cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age &gt;= 18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Histologically confirmed solid tumor malignancy for which no curative therapy exists&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants must have received at least one prior systemic treatment regimen for their&#xD;
           disease OR be ineligible to receive available standard treatments for their disease OR&#xD;
           refused first-line standard systemic treatments but have been treated with other&#xD;
           anti-cancer agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is a Phase I study which will accrue up to 45 subjects total, accounting for screen&#xD;
           failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants will be co-treated for 3 cycles with tofacitinib given orally for the first&#xD;
           10 days of each 21 day cycle, and LMB-100 given on days 4, 6 and 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A 3+3 dose escalation schema will be used. Two dose levels are planned. One minus dose&#xD;
           level could be utilized if dose de-escalation is necessary.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Following identification of an optimal dose and schedule, an expansion phase of 15&#xD;
           participants will be initiated at the optimal dose for patients with pancreatic&#xD;
           adenocarcinoma and extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma. At least 8 participants in the&#xD;
           expansion phase must have pancreatic adenocarcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Participants on the Dose Escalation and Dose Expansion Arms who appear to be obtaining&#xD;
           clinical benefit from LMB-100/tofacitinib after 3 cycles of treatment may elect to&#xD;
           receive additional cycles of therapy at the discretion of the PI.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Known or clinically suspected CNS primary tumors or metastases including&#xD;
             leptomeningeal metastases as CNS penetration of LMB-100 is expected to be poor. CNS&#xD;
             metastases are permitted if they have been previously treated, are asymptomatic, and&#xD;
             have had no requirement for steroids or enzyme-inducing anticonvulsants in the last 14&#xD;

             compliance with the protocol or interpretation of results, including significant&#xD;
             pulmonary disease other than that related to the primary cancer, uncontrolled diabetes&#xD;
             mellitus, and/or significant cardiovascular disease (such as New York Heart&#xD;
             Association Class III or IV cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the last 6&#xD;
             months, unstable arrhythmias, unstable angina, or clinically significant pericardial&#xD;
             effusion).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any known diagnoses, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition (other than&#xD;
             mesothelin [+] cancer diagnosis) that would contraindicate the use of an&#xD;
             investigational drug, interfere with tumor measurement or lead to a life expectancy of&#xD;
             less than 6 months as judged by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Contraindication to receiving prophylactic doses of low-molecular weight heparin&#xD;
             (LMWH) or direct oral anticoagulants (DOAC) such as current active bleeding (except&#xD;
             for grade 1 hematuria or epistaxis), recent history of significant bleeding without&#xD;
             subsequent effective medical or surgical intervention, known history of gastric&#xD;
             varices, uncontrolled malignant hypertension, history of coagulopathy that confers&#xD;
             increased risk of bleeding. Patients on concurrent treatment with anti-platelet agents&#xD;
             such as aspirin or clopidogrel are eligible if deemed to have acceptable risk of&#xD;
             bleeding in consultation with Hematologist. Patients already receiving prophylactic or&#xD;
             therapeutic doses of anticoagulant (heparin-based or DOAC) for at least 4 weeks with&#xD;
             no indication of significant bleeding while on therapy are considered NOT to have a&#xD;
             contraindication to this therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to administer or unwillingness to comply with recommended VTE prophylaxis&#xD;
             for the duration of study treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior diagnosis of hematologic malignancy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active or uncontrolled infections (including tuberculosis, HIV, HBV, or HCV) or&#xD;
             reasonable clinical suspicion of an active infection (such as cholangitis) as&#xD;
             tofacitinib suppresses lymphocyte signaling and will impair host response to infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Latent TB infection as identified by interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA). If IGRA is&#xD;
             indeterminate, tuberculin skin test (TST) may be used to determine status.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Live attenuated vaccinations within 14 days prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Use of a strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4 within 14 days prior to enrollment or&#xD;

          -  Inability to take or digest oral medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Dementia or altered mental status that would prohibit informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because the effects of LMB-100 and/or&#xD;
             tofacitinib on the developing fetus are unknown and may have the potential to cause&#xD;
             teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk&#xD;
             for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with&#xD;
             LMB-100 and/or tofacitinib, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is&#xD;
             treated with either of these agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Baseline QTcF interval of &gt; 470 ms, participants with baseline resting bradycardia &lt;&#xD;
             45 beats per minute, or baseline resting tachycardia &gt;100 beats per minute.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with contra-indication and/or history of severe hypersensitivity&#xD;
             reactions to any components related to LMB-100 and tofacitinib.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have previously received LMB-100 (and therefore have high-levels of&#xD;
             preexisting ADA s to drug)&#xD;
