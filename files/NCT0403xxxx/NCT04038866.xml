      In functional environments, dual-tasks (DT) are common and require a correct motor and&#xD;
      cognitive performance to be carried out successfully. In people with neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), to walk with a secondary task affects gait. The&#xD;
      inclusion of DT to the assessment and physical rehabilitation of patients allows to simulate&#xD;
      day-to-day contexts in a controlled and safe environment and consequently, extrapolate more&#xD;
      easily the advances of rehabilitation to daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project studied the effects of a gait rehabilitation program with dual tasks (DUALGAIT)&#xD;
      in patients with Parkinson's disease and compared the results with a control active group of&#xD;
      patients who performed a general physical rehabilitation program (without dual-task and only&#xD;
      motor exercise practice).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigator's hypothesis is that gait training under dual conditions has a greater&#xD;
      effect than traditional motor physiotherapy programs on the biomechanics of parkinsonian&#xD;
      gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study is a randomized controlled clinical trial, with evaluators blind to the&#xD;
      allocation of participants in the different groups.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
      In functional environments, dual-tasks (DT) are common and require a correct motor and&#xD;
      cognitive performance to be carried out successfully. In people with neurodegenerative&#xD;
      diseases such as Parkinson's disease (PD), to walk with a secondary task affects gait causing&#xD;
      an alteration of velocity, stride length, cadence and double support time and therefore,&#xD;
      greater risk of falls. In fact, patients report gait impairments as the most disabling motor&#xD;
      symptoms of the disease. The inclusion of DT to the assessment and physical rehabilitation of&#xD;
      patients allows to simulate day-to-day contexts in a controlled and safe environment and&#xD;
      consequently, extrapolate more easily the advances of rehabilitation to daily life.&#xD;
      Advantages of this kind of training are not only functional, but it could induce&#xD;
      neuroplasticity because it is a highly challenging activity for people with PD. While the&#xD;
      neurophysiological changes of dual-task training are not yet known, the effects of training&#xD;
      with dual-tasks on gait seem relatively clear. Studies so far have shown that improvements of&#xD;
      spatiotemporal parameters of DT gait can be observed in integrated and consecutive DT&#xD;
      training, which means that the addition of cognitive tasks into gait rehabilitation, either&#xD;
      simultaneous or consecutively, is effective. However, there is not enough evidence that DT&#xD;
      training is better than traditional EP training, i.e., including only motor training in&#xD;
      single-task (ST) mode. The rest of the published studies include a passive control group&#xD;
      (i.e. group that does not perform any type of control rehabilitation) or they correspond to&#xD;
      repeated measures studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, there are other methodological issues that hinder the external validity of the&#xD;
      experiments referenced so far. Firstly, the use of the same DT, both in training and&#xD;
      evaluation of these effects training, could prevent to observe the transfers of these effects&#xD;
      in untrained contexts. Secondly, the use of complex secondary tasks during the assessment&#xD;
      such as mathematical tasks or recite alphabet letters may not be representative of the DT&#xD;
      that occur in daily life. Thirdly, the different studies included the follow-up usually one&#xD;
      month after the training, only one study evaluated the effects beyond this time. Finally, the&#xD;
      lack of training done in a group, it prevents knowing if training with DT is possible in a&#xD;
      group format, as well as individually at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, this study aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the short and mid-term effectiveness of a group dual-task program versus a&#xD;
           group single-task program on biomechanics gait in people with PD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To analyze the effect of dual-task therapy on clinical gait variables (standardized&#xD;
           scales and tests), cognitive performance and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To analyze the impact of secondary cognitive and motor tasks on single-gait before and&#xD;
           after both physiotherapy programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the parkinsonian gait before and after both therapies with normal gait from&#xD;
           matched healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a single-blind, Randomized Control Trial (RCT) with 8-week follow-up and a&#xD;
      convenience sample (specifically, modal instance sampling) in two parallel-group&#xD;
      (experimental and active control group [1:1]) and one matched healthy control group and&#xD;
      factorial design study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      BLINDING&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the nature of physical rehabilitation interventions, patients cannot be totally blind&#xD;
      to the treatment that were performed and neither the treating physiotherapists, but the&#xD;
      hypothesis and objectives of the study were hidden. At the same time, all participants were&#xD;
      instructed to not divulge information regarding their intervention to the raters&#xD;
      physiotherapists, who were blinded to group allocation in all assessment times. To control&#xD;
      expectancy effects for patients it was explained that it is not yet determined which therapy&#xD;
      is more effective. On the other hand, a code of consecutive numbers were assigned to the&#xD;
      patients without pointing to the treatment group to which they belong.&#xD;
&#xD;
      RANDOMIZATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The randomization process was performed by an extern researcher who is not involved in the&#xD;
      development of the study. Stratified randomization will be performed by the severity stages&#xD;
      of the disease (Hoehn &amp; Yahr stages I, II and III) and participants were accordingly&#xD;
      allocated to one of the two groups of physiotherapy treatment. Randomization was performed&#xD;
      with a Microsoft Excel software with which a random sampling of half of the total of patients&#xD;
      were extracted by the strata set for the dual-task program. After this, the treating&#xD;
      physiotherapists will be responsible for the management and organization of the appointments&#xD;
      of participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      POWER CALCULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size power calculation has been conducted based on the changes in the main&#xD;
      outcomes of gait velocity evidenced in the literature in a verbal dual-task after a dual-gait&#xD;
      training effect with PD patients. Previously, it has been shown that verbal tasks have great&#xD;
      interference on Parkinsonian gait. For the sample size analysis, the Gpower software&#xD;
      (Universität Kiel, Germany, Version 3.1) has been used [25]. A type I statistical error of 5%&#xD;
      and a power of 80% was considered, which has resulted in 24 participants per group of&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      INTERVENTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      To ensure that the therapy sessions were carried out with a maximum of 10 people, the&#xD;
      development of each program was repeated twice (DTP and STP), until completing the training&#xD;
      of all recruited participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups of the study (experimental and active comparator) performed 20 one-hour&#xD;
      rehabilitation sessions, twice a week (10 weeks in total). All sessions of both groups were&#xD;
      developed in a place provided by the researchers with the necessary elements for&#xD;
      rehabilitation and in each of the sessions, there always were two physiotherapists. In each&#xD;
      session, there were no more than ten patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Dual-task group Patients with Parkinson's disease carry out the rehabilitation gait with&#xD;
           a dual-task program (DUALGAIT) with secondary cognitive and upper limb motor tasks.&#xD;
&#xD;
           In this group, the training of walking and functional secondary tasks (cognitive or&#xD;
           motor) first was separately (consecutive task training), to be performed later together&#xD;
           in a dual-task (integrated dual-task training) with a progression system.&#xD;
           Cognitive/motor secondary tasks were different from those used in the assessment of&#xD;
           gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Each training session consisted of three parts: the initial warm-up, dual-training, and&#xD;
           back-to-calm.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objectives to walking improve and exercises were: i) Step/stride length with&#xD;
           objective distance from 0.4 a 0.8 m in a progressive way and adapted to the heights of&#xD;
           the participants, ii) Cadence/velocity training by digital metronome from 60 to 120 bpm,&#xD;
           which in combination with the step lengths allowed the progressive training of walking&#xD;
           velocity, iii) Lateral gait with lengths from 0.4 to 0.8 m., iv) Lower limb kinematics&#xD;
           in support and swing phase through standardized practice of ankle, knee and hip&#xD;
           movements during both phase, v) Arm swing practice during gait through elements,&#xD;
           coordination with a partner and free, vi) Control of the flexor postural pattern by the&#xD;
           practice of postural exercises and active movement that favor upright posture (neck&#xD;
           extension, scapular adduction, shoulder retroversion, pelvic anteversion) and vii) Joint&#xD;
           mobility and dissociation scapular-pelvic waist. In all of them, the use of external&#xD;
           visual, auditory and verbal cues was included to provide the most objective feedback&#xD;
           possible during motor learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Additionally, the cognitive tasks used during the training were rehearsed in different&#xD;
           positions (1st seated, 2nd biped and 3rd static gait) prior to the dual realization with&#xD;
           the forward gait.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The types of secondary tasks trained were: 1) verbal fluency, 2) auditory recognition,&#xD;
           3) visual recognition, 4) mathematical calculation, 5) memory, 6) visuospatial planning,&#xD;
           7) fine motor skills, 8) motor task of money manipulation, 9) motor transport task and&#xD;
           10) motor task of transferring an object to another person. Each task category had a&#xD;
           level of complexity (basic, medium and high).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Single-task group Patients with Parkinson's disease carry out the rehabilitation gait&#xD;
           without a dual-task program (physical and walking exercises without an additional load&#xD;
           of cognitive or upper limb motor tasks). Each training session consisted of three parts:&#xD;
           initial warm-up, physical exercise in single-task condition, and back-to-calm. The&#xD;
           objectives and walking exercises were the same as those performed in the experimental&#xD;
           group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty participants completed the study, 23 performed the dual-task physiotherapy program and&#xD;
      composed the Dual-task group (DTG), while the other 17 formed the Single-task group (STG).&#xD;
      All patients came from the La Fe Clinical and Polytechnic Hospital (Valencia, Spain)&#xD;
      completed all phases of the study. The patients were recruited with the diagnosis made by a&#xD;
      neurological doctor. All participants signed informed consent prior to their participation in&#xD;
      the study, then they were randomly assigned to one of the rehabilitation groups (DTG and&#xD;
      STG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      TEST PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before conducting the biomechanics gait assessments, a previous evaluation was carried out to&#xD;
      verify the eligibility criteria. This valuation session was held a few days before the&#xD;
      biomechanics gait assessment prior to the intervention and the following was verified:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Registration of sociodemographic data and neurological history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Anthropometric evaluation&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical evaluation of Parkinson's disease (Disease duration, Hemibody where signs&#xD;
           predominate, Hoehn &amp; Yahr stage, New Freezing of Gait Questionnaire)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cognitive state (Mini-mental test adapted for Parkinson's disease).&#xD;
&#xD;
      After determining the eligibility criteria, three assessments sessions were carried out at&#xD;
      the University of Valencia laboratories. These were: 1) immediately before starting the&#xD;
      rehabilitation program (Baseline), 2) immediately after completing the rehabilitation program&#xD;
      (Postintervention) and 3) eight weeks after completing the rehabilitation program (8-week&#xD;
      follow-up). Between Postintervention and 8-week follow-up tests, participants did not perform&#xD;
      any kind of physical therapy, sports or physical activity. Participants were evaluated in the&#xD;
      on-medication state. In each of the assessment sessions biomechanics of gait, the clinical&#xD;
      performance of mobility, balance and gait, and cognition were evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biomechanics gait evaluation was carried out in a corridor 10m long and data were&#xD;
      registered using 3D photogrammetry with 12 smart cams (Kinescan/IBV software, Biomechanical&#xD;
      Institute of Valencia, Valencia, Spain, version 5.3.0.1) and two force platforms&#xD;
      (Dinascan/IBV Biomechanical Institute of Valencia, Valencia, Spain). All the participants&#xD;
      walked at a self-selected comfortable speed, barefoot and under five conditions: i) single&#xD;
      task (ST): walking without secondary tasks with the attention focused only on walking&#xD;
      performance, ii) visual dual-task (viDT): walking while watching the time on an analog clock&#xD;
      projected at the end of the walkway, iii) verbal dual-task (veDT): walking while telling the&#xD;
      evaluator the activities they had performed the previous day in a chronological order, iv)&#xD;
      auditory dual-task (aDT): walking while listening and recognizing different daily noises and,&#xD;
      v) motor dual-task (mDT): walking while carrying one glass in each hand and repeatedly&#xD;
      transferring their contents from one to the other. During DT gait, participants were urged to&#xD;
      focus attention on the secondary task. For each of the five evaluated walking conditions, 10&#xD;
      repetitions were performed, five with each foot, to later use their average. Before recording&#xD;
      gait, participants were allowed to walk in the corridor (ST condition) to familiarize&#xD;
      themselves with the test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biomechanics outcomes were:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Spatio-temporal outcomes: velocity (m/s), stride length (m), cadence (steps/min), double&#xD;
           support time (% of gait cycle) and step width (m).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. kinematics outcomes: range of motion of the ankle (°), maximum hip extension (°),&#xD;
           maximum hip flexion (°).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Kinetic outcomes: vertical reaction force 1 (N), vertical reaction force 2 (N),&#xD;
           anterior-posterior reaction force 1 (N).&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the other hand, to know if the effects of the treatments would be detectable with the&#xD;
      clinical tests and scales, a Dynamic Parkinson Gait Scale (DYPAGS), Tinetti Mobility Test,&#xD;
      both total score (TinettiT) and scores from subtest gait (TinettiG) and balance (TinettiB)&#xD;
      and Time up and go test (TUG) were used. Finally, we used the Trail making test, parts A&#xD;
      (TMTa) and B (TMTb) to evaluate executive cognitive performance and the Parkinson's disease&#xD;
      questionnaire-39 (PDQ-39) for quality of life assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTIC ANALYSIS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analyses were performed using SPSS v.24 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Mean and&#xD;
      standard deviations (SD) were calculated. A three-factor mixed Multivariate Analysis of&#xD;
      Variance (MANOVA) was conducted to analyze their effects on the biomechanical dependent&#xD;
      variables previously described in table 3. The within-subject factors are rehabilitation with&#xD;
      three categories (Baseline, Postintervention and Follow-up) and conditions, with five&#xD;
      categories (ST, viDT, veDT, aDT and mDT). The between-subject factor is group with two&#xD;
      categories (DTG and STG). Stride length was standardized by the lower limb length of&#xD;
      participants. In addition, a two-factor mixed MANOVA was conducted to analyze the effects of&#xD;
      within-subject factors rehabilitation and the between-subject factor group on the clinical&#xD;
      tests. When significant effects are found, Bonferroni was used for post hoc comparisons.&#xD;
      Differences was declared statistically significant if p&lt;0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To check for differences between the demographic outcomes between groups, multivariate&#xD;
      one-way analysis with the between-subject factor group was conducted. Furthermore, to test&#xD;
      for sex differences between groups, a chi-square test was used.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the statistical analysis, the following assumptions were checked: 1) Normality, the&#xD;
      distribution of the residuals was tested using the Shapiro-wilk test, 2) Sphericity, the&#xD;
      homogeneity between variances of the differences between pairs of measures was checked with&#xD;
      the Mauchly sphericity test, 3) Homoscedasticity, homogeneity of variances was evaluated&#xD;
      using the Levene test, 4) Equality of covariance matrices, the equality of&#xD;
      variance-covariance matrices across the cells formed by the between-subjects effects was&#xD;
      tested with the Box's M test, 5) Absence of multicollinearity, the correlation level between&#xD;
      dependent variables were observed with the Pearson correlation test. When any of these&#xD;
      assumptions were not met, the necessary statistical corrections were used.&#xD;
