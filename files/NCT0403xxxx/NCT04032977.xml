      The objective of the study is to compare the safety and efficacy profile of PN40082 versus&#xD;
      Restylane Silk Injectable Gel with 0.3% lidocaine (Restylane Silk) for lip augmentation.&#xD;
      Approximately 158 subjects will be randomized at approximately 7 sites in this is a&#xD;
      double-blind, randomized, controlled, multicenter clinical study of subjects seeking lip&#xD;
      augmentation. Subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria will be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      treatment with either PN40082 or Restylane Silk. The Evaluating Investigator will be blinded&#xD;
      to the treatment. Injections of the study device will be performed by an unblinded Treating&#xD;
      Investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At each visit, the blinded Evaluating Investigator evaluations and subject evaluations of the&#xD;
      treated areas will be performed and recorded. Visits and telephone contacts will occur at:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1 / Week 0 (Day 1) - baseline and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 3 (±2 days) - Safety follow-up telephone call&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 14 (±2 days) - Safety follow-up telephone call Visit 2 / Day 28 (±2 days) / Month 1&#xD;
           - interim visit (touch-up if necessary)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 33 (±2 days) - Safety follow-up telephone call (for subjects with touch-up treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 44 (±2 days) - Safety follow-up telephone call (for subjects with touch-up&#xD;
           treatment) Visit 3 / Day 56 (±4 days) / Month 2 - interim visit Visit 4 / Day 84 (±4&#xD;
           days) / Month 3 - interim visit&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 112 (±4 days) / Month 4 - Safety follow-up telephone call&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Day 140 (±4 days) / Month 5 - Safety follow-up telephone call Visit 5 / Day 168 (±7&#xD;
           days) / Month 6 - End of Study (EOS) Visit. All subjects will undergo the consent&#xD;
           procedure for the open label retreatment protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lip Fullness Grading Scale (LFGS) (Overall lip fullness considering both lips together,&#xD;
      fullness of the upper lip and fullness of the lower lip) Perioral lines at rest severity&#xD;
      scale (POL) (Overall perioral lines at rest severity considering both lips together, perioral&#xD;
      lines at rest severity of the upper lip and perioral lines at rest severity of the lower lip)&#xD;
      Patient Global Aesthetic Improvement (pGAI) Investigator Global Aesthetic Improvement (iGAI)&#xD;
      Safety will be assessed by monitoring adverse events (AEs) at all study visits&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other Safety Evaluations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lip Function Lip Sensation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other evaluations include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigator Ease of Use Assessment Swelling Assessment Subject Satisfaction with Lips&#xD;
      Assessment Subjects participation will be approximately 6 months and the study is estimated&#xD;
      to last 20 months from first subject first visit to last subject last visit.&#xD;
