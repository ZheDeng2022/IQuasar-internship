    <textblock>
      The overall objective of this research is to test the effectiveness of a parenting program on&#xD;
      Filipino parents living in California. The sample will include 180 Filipino immigrant&#xD;
      families, half of which will receive the Online Incredible Years® School Age Basic &amp; Advanced&#xD;
      Parent Training Program (intervention) and the other half will receive the American Academy&#xD;
      of Pediatrics' Bright Futures handouts (control) and be placed on a 3-month waitlist for the&#xD;
      IY parenting program.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The overall objective of the proposed research is to test the effectiveness of a parenting&#xD;
      program (Incredible Years® School Age Basic &amp; Advanced Parent Training Program, IYP) on&#xD;
      Filipino parents recruited from multiple community-based settings and its impact on&#xD;
      trajectories of parenting practices, parenting stress, and child problem behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evidence-based parenting interventions provided in early childhood have proven to be&#xD;
      effective in preventing the onset and escalation of child mental health disorders. IYP is one&#xD;
      of the best-studied and most highly regarded parent training programs. As a result of pilot&#xD;
      studies funded by a NIH K23 and a NCATS KL2 award, the investigators have identified IYP as a&#xD;
      community-identified solution for preventing behavioral health disparities, demonstrated IYP&#xD;
      efficacy in improving parenting practices and parenting stress in Filipino parents, and child&#xD;
      problem behavior.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This population was chosen because: 1) Filipinos are the second largest immigrant population&#xD;
      in the U.S. with the highest concentration living in Los Angeles; 2) Filipinos are exposed to&#xD;
      multiple adversities, including immigration stress and relocation, loss of social status, and&#xD;
      lower self-esteem due to discrimination, placing young children at risk for future behavioral&#xD;
      and mental health problems; 3) U.S.-born Filipino youth exhibit higher rates of mental health&#xD;
      problems than non-Hispanic whites and attain significantly lower levels of education than&#xD;
      their foreign-born counterparts and other U.S.-born Asian American populations; and 4)&#xD;
      Filipinos are less likely than non-Hispanic whites to participate in mental health and&#xD;
      preventive care interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed study will be a randomized controlled trial involving 180 parents of children&#xD;
      aged 8-12 years old. Parents will be randomly chosen to receive either a) an online 12 - week&#xD;
      parenting intervention called the Incredible Years (intervention group) or b) AAP bright&#xD;
      future handouts with general parenting advice (control group). The control group will be&#xD;
      offered the Incredible Years after a 3-month wait list period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings will contribute to the scientific literature on preventive and early intervention&#xD;
      programs for children at high risk for future behavioral problems. The data will also provide&#xD;
      important information to understand the processes underlying how IYP affects parenting&#xD;
      practices and subsequent child problem behavior among Filipino families. The importance of&#xD;
      this research rests on its potential to prevent behavioral health disparities in this&#xD;
      understudied and high-risk population.&#xD;

Parents describe their child's behavior within the past 6 months (from baseline and from 3 month time points). Questions are rated on a scale from 0 (not true) to 2 (very true or often true). The CBCL screens for the following behaviors: Aggressive Behavior, Anxious/Depressed, Attention Problems, Rule-Breaking Behavior, Somatic Complaints, Social Problems, Thought Problems, Withdrawn/Depressed. Results for each subscale are presented as a percentile and T-score, with scores above 97th percentile considered as &quot;clinical range&quot; based on the DSM-V.</description>

    <description>The Incredible Years® School Age Basic Parent Training Program targets many of the proposed mechanisms and risk factors for internalizing distress in early childhood: harsh and unpredictable or critical parenting behaviors. Parents also learn cognitive strategies for themselves; such as self-praise, coping thoughts, how to challenge negative thoughts, and how to get support that they are encouraged to model for and teach their children. Finally, they learn how to be more positive and nurturing through academic, social and emotional coaching.</description>
