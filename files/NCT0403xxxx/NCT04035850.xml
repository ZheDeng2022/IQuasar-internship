    <textblock>
      The present study is a single-group open-label investigation of the potential efficacy of&#xD;
      Vortioxetine for treatment of 30 adult volunteers with Hoarding Disorder (HD) (flexible-dose&#xD;
      study, with a target dose range 5-25mg). The proposed study will be the first Vortioxetine&#xD;
      study in HD, and conducted at the Anxiety Treatment and Research Clinic (ATRC) Canada's&#xD;
      largest academic anxiety clinic, a regional referral center for individuals with HD. The&#xD;
      study requires a Letter of No Objection from Health Canada and the study will be approved by&#xD;
      Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (HiREB).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hoarding disorder (HD) is a common and severe new diagnostic category. HD has two core&#xD;
      dimensions: difficulty discarding items and the resultant clutter, which may preclude the use&#xD;
      of living spaces for their intended. Other HD criteria, distress and impairment, often&#xD;
      include unemployment, removal of children, health risks (e.g. infestations, falls, fires,&#xD;
      etc.). The estimated prevalence of hoarding is 5.3% in adults and 2% in youth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Existing treatments of hoarding are only partially effective. Emerging evidence supports the&#xD;
      partial efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) in the treatment of HD though,&#xD;
      paradoxically, this therapy mostly addresses the excessive attachment to possessions but not&#xD;
      the above-identified cognitive deficits. On the other hand, the study of pharmacological&#xD;
      treatments for hoarding is in preliminary stages and there currently are no well-validated or&#xD;
      official guidelines for the use of psychotropic medications in HD. Given that HD is a highly&#xD;
      prevalent and severe condition, there is an urgent need to address this gap in the literature&#xD;
      to improve the well-being of patients with the disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Emerging evidence suggests that serotonergic medications may have an important role in the&#xD;
      treatment of HD. First, HD is highly comorbid with obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and&#xD;
      major depressive disorder (MDD), two disorders that respond well to serotonergic medications.&#xD;
      Second, a recent meta analysis of 14 clinical trials suggested that hoarding symptoms had&#xD;
      responded to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRIs) (i.e., paroxetine and sertraline)&#xD;
      and venlafaxine, a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, with response rates&#xD;
      ranging between 37%-76% of participants. Interestingly, this response rate is similar to&#xD;
      response rates reported by meta-analyses of the treatment response of OCD to SRIs. However,&#xD;
      those findings should be interpreted with caution given the lack of controlled studies and&#xD;
      the diagnostic heterogeneity, the latter a result of the diagnostic ambiguity that prevailed&#xD;
      prior to the introduction of HD in the fifth version of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual&#xD;
      (DSM-5).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Treatment of hoarding symptoms should ideally target the obsessional aspect of the syndrome&#xD;
      (abnormal attachment to possessions), some or all of the identified cognitive deficits and&#xD;
      commonly associated comorbidities. Although preoccupation with possessions, an OCD/MDD-like&#xD;
      feature of hoarding, can arguably be addressed by the use of Serotonin reuptake inhibitors&#xD;
      (SR) medications that are highly effective for the treatment of OCD and MDD , targeting&#xD;
      cognitive deficits in hoarding likely requires a different approach and the use of newer&#xD;
      generation serotonergic medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vortioxetine is a novel serotonergic antidepressant with a unique pharmacodynamics profile,&#xD;
      reported precognitive effects and proven efficacy for the treatment of MDD . Vortioxetine is&#xD;
      a 5-HT3, 5-HT7 and 5-HT1D receptor antagonist, 5-HT1B receptor partial agonist, 5-HT1A&#xD;
      receptor agonist and serotonin (5-HT) transporter (SERT) inhibitor. There is preliminary&#xD;
      evidence that Vortioxetine's unique serotonergic modulation profile may be associated with&#xD;
      distinct mechanisms of action at the brain network level. In addition, several studies1&#xD;
      report that Vortioxetine is associated with improved cognitive performance in patients with&#xD;
      MDD. These procognitve effects appear to distinguish Vortioxetine from other antidepressant&#xD;
      agents. As such, Vortioxetine should be considered a prime candidate for medication trials in&#xD;
      HD. To date, however, no studies of vortioxetine in HD have been published.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this in mind the goal of the present study is to conduct a preliminary, single-group&#xD;
      open-label investigation of the potential efficacy of Vortioxetine for treatment of 30 adult&#xD;
      volunteers with HD (flexible-dose study, with a target dose range 5-25mg). The proposed study&#xD;
      will be the first Vortioxetine study in HD, and conducted at the ATRC Canada's largest&#xD;
      academic anxiety clinic, a regional referral center for individuals with HD. The study&#xD;
      requires a letter of no objection from Health Canada and the study will be approved by&#xD;
      Hamilton Integrated Research Ethics Board (HiREB).&#xD;
