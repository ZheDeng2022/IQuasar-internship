  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Compassion focused therapy (CFT) is a relatively new psychological therapy. Research has&#xD;
      shown that CFT can improve psychological wellbeing and functioning in people with anxiety and&#xD;
      depressive disorders. Research into CFT has focused on working age adults. It would be useful&#xD;
      to evaluate whether CFT could be of benefit to the older adult population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The present study aims to use the Medical Research Council (MRC) framework for developing and&#xD;
      evaluating new treatments for complex conditions such as mental health. The present study&#xD;
      aims to explore the feasibility and acceptability of a CFT group as a treatment for older&#xD;
      adults with anxiety or depressive disorders. Additionally, the study aims to use the&#xD;
      statistical data to inform future research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be older adults (aged 60+) referred to National Health Service (NHS)&#xD;
      Greater Glasgow and Clyde (GGC) older people's mental health service for common mental health&#xD;
      conditions. People with psychosis, addictions, diagnosis of dementia or risk of self-harm&#xD;
      will be ineligible. Participants will be offered the group as part of their treatment.&#xD;
      Participants in the group will be identified and approached by an NHS clinician and asked to&#xD;
      consent to participate in the study; non participation in the study will not affect their&#xD;
      place in the group. The group protocol has been developed from previous research and will&#xD;
      last for 10 weekly sessions of 90 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is mixed methods, using both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative&#xD;
      part will use outcome measures which will look for a statistical relationship between the CFT&#xD;
      group and changes in wellbeing and functioning. The qualitative part will use a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview to hear people's experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CFT group will be delivered by an NHS clinical psychologist and Community Psychiatric&#xD;
      Nurse (CPN).&#xD;

      Recruitment Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Potential participants will be recruited from the older adult service within NHS GGC.&#xD;
      Multidisciplinary team (MDT) staff within the service will identify potential participants&#xD;
      for a CFT group and if they agree to participate in the group, attendees will then be asked&#xD;
      to participate in the study by the student researcher. Group attendees' inclusion in the&#xD;
      group is not dependent on their participation in the study. Inclusion and exclusion criteria&#xD;
      will be assessed by Principal Clinical Psychologist and eligible participants will be asked&#xD;
      for their consent to participate in the project by Trainee Clinical Psychologist.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principal Clinical Psychologist will administer outcome measures at beginning and end of the&#xD;
      group programme. Additionally, measures will be administered after specific sessions to&#xD;
      assess the effect of specific interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures to be used are -&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) - a 9 item self-report measure of depressive&#xD;
           symptoms.1 minute completion time. Administered after sessions 1, 5, 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) - a 7 item self-report measure of anxiety symptoms.&#xD;
           1 minute completion time Administered after sessions 1, 5, 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mechanisms of Change:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Forms of self-criticising/attacking &amp; self-reassuring scale (FSCRS) - a self-report measure&#xD;
      of self-criticism and self-reassurance. Used to evaluate the level of self-criticism a person&#xD;
      experiences, which is often linked to mental health problems. Additionally, it evaluates the&#xD;
      ability to reassure oneself. 4 minutes completion time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Administered after sessions 1, 9, 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Self-compassion scale (SCS) - a self-report measure measures a person's ability to show&#xD;
           themselves compassion in the face of challenges. 4 minutes completion time. Administered&#xD;
           after sessions 1, 8, 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Toronto Mindfulness Scale - Trait - a self report measure of mindfulness traits such as&#xD;
           curiosity, acceptance and openness. Given the CFT group incorporates elements of&#xD;
           mindfulness, this will be useful to measure. 3 minutes completion time. Administered&#xD;
           after sessions 1, 7, 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other as Shamer Scale - a self-repost measure to evaluate beliefs a person has about&#xD;
           other's evaluation of them. 3 minutes completion time. Administered after sessions 1, 5,&#xD;
           10.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Social Connectedness Scale - Revised - a self-report measure which evaluate people's&#xD;
           feelings of connectedness to others. To measure whether the group itself has an impact&#xD;
           on people's feelings. 4 minutes completion time. Administered after sessions 1, 5, 10.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As this is a feasibility study, a mix methods study design will be used. For the quantitative&#xD;
      part of the study a within group design will be used to assess outcomes at baseline and&#xD;
      posttreatment. Treatment acceptability will also be evaluated by semi-structured interviews&#xD;
      following the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CFT Protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group programme of CFT will run for 10 sessions lasting 90 minutes per session. The group&#xD;
      has been developed by an experienced NHS Clinical Psychologist working with older adults. The&#xD;
      group protocol has been developed from a previous group run in NHS GGC with working age&#xD;
      adults. The group will be delivered by NHS clinicians and led by Dr John Hickey. The sessions&#xD;
      are titled as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Session 1: Introduction, aims and soothing rhythm breathing Session 2 &amp; 3: Psychoeducation&#xD;
      Session 4: Formulation Session 5: Formulation &amp; the threat system Session 6: Compassionate&#xD;
      Self Session 7: Compassionate Image and barriers to compassion Session 8: Multiple selves -&#xD;
      responding with different emotions Session 9: Shame and self-criticism Session 10: Review,&#xD;
      formulation and planning ahead Participants will be asked to practice techniques and record&#xD;
      their progress throughout the intervention. They will practice breathing and mindfulness&#xD;
      techniques and keep a compassionate diary to support their learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All outcome measures will be completed by participants pre-intervention, they will be posted&#xD;
      to participants prior to the group (once consent has been received) and they will be asked to&#xD;
      bring them to the first session. Copies will be available at the first session in case&#xD;
      participants forget to bring them or have difficulties completing them. Time will be&#xD;
      available to complete measures if necessary. The measures will also be repeated after&#xD;
      specific sessions to evaluate any change from a specific intervention. Demographic data will&#xD;
      also be obtained to allow for a description of the data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lead clinician will administer and collect the outcome measures at the end of the&#xD;
      specified session. Attendance and dropout from the group will also be recorded for analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the completion of the group, participants will be asked to attend for a&#xD;
      semi-structured interview to discuss their experience of the CFT group protocol. All those&#xD;
      who consented to participate in the study will be asked to participate in the semi-structured&#xD;
      interview. The interviews will be conducted by Fiona McConnell (Trainee Clinical&#xD;
      Psychologist). Interviews will be based on a topic guide, which will focus on the&#xD;
      participant's experience of the intervention and their thoughts for improvements. The&#xD;
      interviews will be audio recorded and transcribed and all patient identifiable data will be&#xD;
      anonymised. The recordings will be destroyed once the project is complete.&#xD;
