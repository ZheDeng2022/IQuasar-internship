      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes is a chronic disease that requires lifelong self care behavior. Successful treatment&#xD;
      of chronic diseases is closely associated with the education of both patients and their&#xD;
      relatives. Patient education is one of the most important responsibilities of diabetes nurse&#xD;
      educators. In the management of diabetes, helping patients to improve their health and&#xD;
      quality of life is considered an important aspect of diabetes self-care education. Solid&#xD;
      organ transplantation is now the standard of care for end-stage organ failure. New-onset&#xD;
      diabetes mellitus after solid organ transplantation (NODAT) has emerged as an increasingly&#xD;
      important determinant of outcomes and survival in transplant recipients. Patient education&#xD;
      and self-management are crucial for ensuring successful outcome post transplantation. No&#xD;
      adequate studies concerning education of diabetic renal transplants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the work: The aim of this work is to evaluate the effect of diabetes education given&#xD;
      to renal transplant recipients with new onset diabetes after transplantation (NODAT) on their&#xD;
      self-care activities and metabolic control variables and reversibility of the present chronic&#xD;
      diabetic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will involve 210 diabetic renal transplant patients (NODAT) who will be referred&#xD;
      from Hamed Al-Essa organ transplant center to Dasman Diabetes Institute. These patients will&#xD;
      be sub-divided into three subgroups: patients who will receive group education (n=70) will&#xD;
      represent group1, patients who will receive one to one education (n=70) will represent group&#xD;
      2, while those who will receive the conventional (not structured) education program will&#xD;
      serve as control group 3(n= 70). All patients of group 1 and 2 will receive intensive&#xD;
      education for 3-4 months, then refreshment session every 3 months for 2 years. Initially,&#xD;
      patient data will be collected through 3 types of forms: patient identification form,&#xD;
      metabolic control parameters form and diabetes self-care scale questionnaire; then every 6&#xD;
      months metabolic parameters and diabetes self-care scale questionnaire will be reassessed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected outcome: Patient education given to transplant recipients with NODAT could affect&#xD;
      patients' self-care activities, metabolic control positively and possibly help in reversal of&#xD;
      chronic diabetic complications&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The research population will include organ transplant recipients with NODAT who are followed&#xD;
      up in Hamed AL-Essa organ transplant centre of Kuwait and who will meet the eligibility&#xD;
      criteria. Two hundred and ten diabetic renal transplant recipients will be enrolled in this&#xD;
      prospective randomised controlled study. Patients who fulfil the following criteria will be&#xD;
      included in the study: 1) transplant duration more than 6 months; 2) being an outpatient; 3)&#xD;
      not having any psychiatric history of illness; 4) written consent to participate in the&#xD;
      research; and 5) age of diabetic patients more than 21 years . We will exclude paediatrics&#xD;
      (bellow 21 years) and mentally abnormal patients. Ethical principles of the research Written&#xD;
      permission will be received from the institutions where the research will be carried out.&#xD;
      Information form including the aim and scope of the research will be submitted to Ethical&#xD;
      Committees of both ministry of health (MOH) of Kuwait and Dasman Diabetes Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection tools&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient identification form:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This form will include information about the patient's identifying characteristics such as&#xD;
      age, gender, education status and disease-related information such as duration of the disease&#xD;
      and the treatments management of diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolic control parameters form:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This form will include patient's metabolic control variables such as HbA1c, lipids (Total&#xD;
      cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL),&#xD;
      renal and liver function tests. Metabolic control parameters will be measured in Hamed&#xD;
      Al-Essa organ transplantation center (OTC) outpatient clinic and will be sent with each&#xD;
      patient to Dasman Diabetes Institute within one week of patient evaluation for starting&#xD;
      educational program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood pressure, height, weight, body mass index and waist circumference of patients will be&#xD;
      measured and recorded by the researcher each time by using the same measurement device and&#xD;
      method. Patients' waist circumferences will be measured midway between costal margin and&#xD;
      iliac crests by a measuring tape in standing position, over underwear and after slight&#xD;
      expiration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diabetes self-care scale (DSCS) The Arabic translated 24-items scale- developed in English by&#xD;
      Lee and Fisher(41) which measures the self care of patients with diabetes -will be applied to&#xD;
      patients before and after the education program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection method In the pretest phase of the research, patients will be given a patient&#xD;
      identification form, metabolic control parameters form and a DSCS. The forms will be&#xD;
      completed within15-25 minutes by the patients in the presence of the researcher. Telephone&#xD;
      numbers and addresses of patients will be taken for proper communication if needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient education Group education sessions will be carried out in special halls in Dasman&#xD;
      Diabetes Institute (DDI) after proper coordination with the randomly selected patients (group&#xD;
      1) (6-10 patients in each education group). Patients of one to one education group (group 2)&#xD;
      will receive education sessions individually in closed education clinics of DDI. The first&#xD;
      session will last for 60 minutes then the next sessions will last for 30 minutes. The content&#xD;
      of education will be repeated entirely or partly by the researcher according to each&#xD;
      patient's needs. Mixed education techniques such as description, question and answer&#xD;
      techniques will be used as an education method and feedback will be stimulated trying to&#xD;
      enable patients to understand their self-care management independently. Refreshment education&#xD;
      sessions will be delivered every 3 months later on till the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regarding patients of the third group (control group), each patient will receive the&#xD;
      conventional (non-structured) education program in their mother hospital (OTC).&#xD;
