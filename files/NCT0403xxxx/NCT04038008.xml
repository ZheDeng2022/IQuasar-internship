  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This single dose study is designed in accordance with EMA (the European Medicines Agency)&#xD;
      regulatory guidelines, with the aim of characterizing the comparative bioavailability of&#xD;
      fluconazole in the two formulations in healthy subjects. As this is a bioequivalence trial&#xD;
      where each subject will receive each study treatment in a crossover fashion, a control group&#xD;
      is not included. Within the clinical portion of the study each subject will receive a single&#xD;
      oral dose of the test and the reference formulation in compliance with the generated&#xD;
      randomization code. The primary study endpoints are the pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters Cmax&#xD;
      and AUC0-t of fluconazole.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a single center, randomized, 2-treatment, 2-period, 2-sequence, crossover, single&#xD;
      dose study design, in which 26 healthy adult subjects will receive one of the study&#xD;
      treatments during each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to determine the bioequivalence of two different formulations&#xD;
      of fluconazole after a single oral dose administration under fasting conditions. The&#xD;
      secondary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of the Test&#xD;
      product compared to the Reference formulation in healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject eligibility for this study will be determined at the screening visit and eligible&#xD;
      subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit at least 10 hours prior to drug&#xD;
      administration for each study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject who withdraws or is withdrawn during the pretrial evaluations but before receiving&#xD;
      the IP will not be considered as a drop-out and will not be included in the final database.&#xD;
      Standbys should be recruited and available to replace any subject who withdraws prior to the&#xD;
      first drug administration. On-study drop-outs will not be replaced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Altasciences will generate the randomization code with a computer program according to the&#xD;
      study design, the number of subjects and the sequence of treatment administration. The random&#xD;
      allocation of each sequence of treatment administration to each subject will be done in such&#xD;
      a way that the study is balanced. Once generated, the randomization code will be final and&#xD;
      will not be modified.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each study period, subjects will receive a single 40 mg oral dose of olmesartan medoxomil&#xD;
      (the test or the reference formulation). Study participants will be aware they will receive&#xD;
      different formulations of the same drug, without being informed which product (Test or&#xD;
      Reference) is being administered.The date and time of each dose will be recorded. For each&#xD;
      subject, all scheduled postdose activities and assessments will be performed relative to the&#xD;
      time of study drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will fast overnight (no food or drink except water), for a minimum of 10 hours prior&#xD;
      to dosing. Fasting will continue for at least 4 hours following drug administration, after&#xD;
      which a standardized lunch will be served. A supper and a light snack will be served at&#xD;
      appropriate times thereafter, but not before 9 hours after dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 22 blood samples will be collected (one tube of 4 mL each) in each study period&#xD;
      for PK assessments. The first blood sample will be collected prior to drug administration&#xD;
      while the others will be collected up to 120 hours after drug administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The analyte to be measured in the present study will be fluconazole. Fluconazole plasma&#xD;
      concentrations will be measured according to a validated bioanalytical method.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects are to be discharged from the clinic after the 24-hour postdose PK sample&#xD;
      collection, and following medical approval. However, they may be advised to stay at the&#xD;
      clinical site for safety reasons, if judged necessary by the physician in charge. Subjects&#xD;
      will return to the clinic for blood collections at 48, 72, 96, and 120 hours postdose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected terminal elimination half-life of fluconazole is 34 hours. To avoid any&#xD;
      carry-over effect, a wash-out of 21 calendar days is planned between drug administrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision of which subjects will be included in the PK analysis is to be documented by the&#xD;
      pharmacokineticist (or delegate) and approved by the sponsor before the start of the sample&#xD;
      analysis by the bioanalytical facility. Subjects who are expected to provide evaluable PK&#xD;
      data for both the Test and Reference products (based on viable PK samples) will be included&#xD;
      in the PK analysis. Concentration data of the remaining subjects will be presented&#xD;
      separately. Subjects who do not complete the sampling schedule of one or more study periods&#xD;
      may be included in the PK and statistical analysis and bioequivalence determination for only&#xD;
      the PK parameters that are judged not to be affected by the missing sample(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The parameter Tmax will be analyzed using a non-parametric approach. Test of fixed period,&#xD;
      sequence and treatment effects will be based on the Wilcoxon's rank sum test (Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      U-test). When appropriate (e.g. small or sparse sample), the exact version of the test will&#xD;
      also be presented. All primary endpoints will be statistically analyzed using an ANOVA model.&#xD;
      The fixed factors included in this model will be the subject effect (nested within sequence),&#xD;
      the treatment received, the period at which it was given, as well as the sequence in which&#xD;
      each treatment is received.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The treatment, sequence and period effects will the evaluated at the 5% significance level.&#xD;
      Explanations for significant effects will be provided for log transformed PK parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 90% confidence interval for the exponential of the difference in LSmeans between the Test&#xD;
      and Reference product will be calculated for the ln-transformed parameters (Test to Reference&#xD;
      ratio of geometric LSmeans).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical inference of fluconazole will be based on a bioequivalence approach using the&#xD;
      following standards:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. The ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence interval calculated&#xD;
           from the exponential of the difference between the Test and Reference for the&#xD;
           lntransformed parameters Cmax and AUC0-T should all be within the 80.00 to 125.00%&#xD;
           bioequivalence range.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. In case if AUC0-T is less than 80% of AUC0-∞ in more than 20% of the observations,&#xD;
           truncated AUC0-72 will be used for bioequivalence assessment instead of AUC0-T. The&#xD;
           ratio of geometric LSmeans with corresponding 90% confidence interval calculated from&#xD;
           the exponential of the difference between the Test and Reference for the ln-transformed&#xD;
           parameters Cmax and AUC0-72 should all be within the 80.00 to 125.00% bioequivalence&#xD;
           range.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The safety population will include all subjects who received at least one formulation (Test&#xD;
      or Reference). Safety assessments will include physical examination, clinical laboratory test&#xD;
      and AE monitoring. Additional safety measurements may be performed at the discretion of the&#xD;
      investigator for reasons related to subject safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Total study duration: up to 55 days (including screening).&#xD;
