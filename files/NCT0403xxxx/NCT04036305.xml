  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Local anesthetic resistance is commonly reported by patients with EDS. However, there are no&#xD;
      objective data on the occurrence of local anesthetic resistance in EDS patients and in&#xD;
      healthy volunteers. We propose to collect such objective data on the frequency of drug&#xD;
      resistance and whether any problems with local anesthesia are due to initial ineffectiveness&#xD;
      or due to its effects dissipating too soon.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There was a prior large online questionnaire to better understand the issues around local&#xD;
      anesthetic resistance. By November 2018, 933 EDS patients (total 1059 respondents) completed&#xD;
      the survey, 99.2% of which had previously received local anesthetics. Among these patients,&#xD;
      88% reported that they have &quot;had a problem with local anesthetic injection not working&#xD;
      adequately or properly,&quot; while only 54% of respondents without EDS reported a similar&#xD;
      problem. These data suggests that local anesthetic resistance might be more prevalent in&#xD;
      patients with EDS than in the general population. If these findings are true, then this might&#xD;
      have significant implications for the appropriate management of these patients during minor&#xD;
      surgery and dental procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to assess the frequency and related issues around local anesthetic resistance&#xD;
      in EDS patients, including whether the problem is a lack of analgesia or a timing effect&#xD;
      (short duration of action or delayed onset of action), and whether the problem relates only&#xD;
      to some local anesthetics or whether there is a problem with the whole class of local&#xD;
      anesthetics.&#xD;
