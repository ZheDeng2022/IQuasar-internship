  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The DGC provides an end-to-end solution to the Oncogenetics screening process from&#xD;
      participant registration to receipt of the genetic test results and their interpretation.&#xD;
      These steps are provided using personalized animated videos.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Step 1. Registration: During the initial phone call with potential participants, qualified&#xD;
      staff that are part of the study will explain the process and extend an invitation to&#xD;
      participated in the study. The DGC process will begin when the Sheba MC Genetics Institute&#xD;
      will send potential participants a link. Participant will undergo the standard two-factor&#xD;
      authentication method based on phone number and last four digits of the ID number. At the end&#xD;
      of this process a new user will be created in the system. Note: There are no physical risks&#xD;
      associated with participation in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 2. Interactive medical questionnaire: The interactive medical questionnaire is defined&#xD;
      as the process of gathering personal information relevant to the specific clinical genetic&#xD;
      scenario (e.g. personal information, personal and family medical information). The&#xD;
      questionnaire is dynamic and is interactively adapted based on live information supplied by&#xD;
      the participant. The questionnaire was approved by the Sheba MC PI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Please note that the essence of the DGC system is to enable to conduct genetically relevant&#xD;
      medical informatics processes in the context of digital sessions with secured and adaptive&#xD;
      systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the major aims of the questionnaire is to enable the use of the scientific risk&#xD;
      calculator &quot;BRCAPRO&quot; (a breast and ovarian cancer risk assessment algorithm accepted by&#xD;
      Israel MOH). This allows the DGC to provide the participant with her risks for being a BRCA&#xD;
      mutation carrier and the risk of developing breast/ovarian cancer prior to the oncogenetic&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of that phase of the DGC use, the participant will be informed that: &quot;You are&#xD;
      presented with a questionnaire regarding genetic test for having a mutation in BRCA1/2, by&#xD;
      answering the questions you hereby accept the participation this medical questionnaire.&#xD;
      Before the submission of DNA sample to the test you will be asked to sign an Informed Consent&#xD;
      for the participation in the study, that this questionnaire is part of it.&quot; Note: The genetic&#xD;
      test is part of a routine test performed at the Sheba MC Genetic Institute and is not part of&#xD;
      this study. Participants will be asked to sign the routine Informed Consent for the genetic&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 4. Sample submission and signing a hard copy Informed Consent for the BRCA1/2 test: At&#xD;
      the Sheba MC Genetic Institute, before the submission of buccal/saliva/blood samples to the&#xD;
      test, participants will be asked to sign a hard copy Informed Consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Step 5. Introductory personalized animated video: A personalized and dynamic animated video&#xD;
      is machine-generated following a well-characterized medically supervised algorithm to tailor&#xD;
      the video to each participant. The algorithm that generates the personalized introductory&#xD;
      video is approved by the Sheba medical staff. Participants will receive a short-animated&#xD;
      video summarizing the medical process they are going through, the potential risks and other&#xD;
      details that they need to know and understand before approving and continuing with the&#xD;
      procedure. The content of these videos is dynamic and in full alignment with the Sheba MC&#xD;
      requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The dynamic video is generated by a third party that receives ONLY the following information:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Participant first name&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Participant age&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Is the participant having one of the following cancers: breast, ovarian, pancreas,&#xD;
           stomach, uterus or other. As a general approach we need to address women with cancer&#xD;
           differently than cancer free women. In addition, the potential risks of breast and&#xD;
           ovarian cancers is different. The pancreas, stomach, uterus indications are important as&#xD;
           identification of a mutation in the BRCA1/2 genes may lead to change in the therapeutic&#xD;
           options for these women.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Is the risk for harboring a mutation in BRCA1/2 as determined by BRCAPRO 10% or above?&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Is the risk for breast cancer according BRCAPRO greater than 20%?&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the dynamic video, the system will examine participants' understanding by a short&#xD;
      interactive quiz that summarizes the relevant topics presented in the video. Following the&#xD;
      quiz, the participant will be asked to sign an electronic Informed Consent for carrying out&#xD;
      the routine mutation carrier test in the BRCA1/2 genes. When the participants come to the&#xD;
      Genetics Institute to provide the buccal/saliva/blood samples, she will re-sign a hard copy&#xD;
      of the Informed Consent in front of the clinician. It is important for the usability study to&#xD;
      test the responsiveness of the participant to sign the electronic Informed Consent following&#xD;
      the personalized introductory video.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators believe that this video will provide a clear and, in most cases, more&#xD;
      thorough explanation than the common face-to-face explanation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Board Dashboard for the Medical Staff: A dedicated dashboard enables medical staff to&#xD;
      monitor the advancement of a participant throughout the process. It will include all the&#xD;
      information gathered from the participant through the on-line registration and questionnaire&#xD;
      and a genetic counselor is able to revise the data. The genetic counselor can send the&#xD;
      participant a signed summary letter (PDF) via the secure DGC system and invite him/her to&#xD;
      perform the genetic test. Following completion of data entering of the medical questionnaire,&#xD;
      the system will automatically run the BRCAPRO risk calculator to predict the participant&#xD;
      predicted lifetime risk of having breast cancer and of being a BRCA1/2 gene mutation carrier.&#xD;
      In case the risk for harboring a mutation in the BRCA1/2 genes is 10% or higher, the cost of&#xD;
      the genetic test is reimbursed by the HMO (in the &quot;health basket&quot;). In those cases, the&#xD;
      participant will receive a signed letter summarizing her family history and specifying the&#xD;
      calculated risk for carrying a BRCA mutation to enable HMO reimbursement of the test cost&#xD;
      (TOFES 17). For women where the estimated risk for harboring mutation is less than 10% the&#xD;
      cost of the test is out of pocket for the participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant concludes the session of Participant Enrollment (Pre-Test), all her data&#xD;
      are presented in the medical staff dashboard. A genetic counselor will be able to edit the&#xD;
      data mainly derived from the self-reported questionnaire and the BRCAPRO predictions. Next,&#xD;
      the genetic counselor will send the participant a signed summary letter (PDF) via the DGC&#xD;
      system. This letter will present the information entered into the system by the participant&#xD;
      and invite her to perform the genetic test. Using the standard two-factor authentication&#xD;
      method based on phone number and the last four digits of the participants' ID number, the&#xD;
      participants will be able to view the report. In cases of risk harboring a mutation in the&#xD;
      BRCA genes &gt;10% that qualify with reimbursed by the HMO, the letter to the participant will&#xD;
      also include the information how to ask for HMO reimbursement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling logic - the logics of the DGC system (the &quot;brain&quot;):&#xD;
&#xD;
      DGC Algorithm: The results of the genetic test chosen by the health care providers are&#xD;
      uploaded to the Sheba MC system via an interface for this specific genetic test. Next, the&#xD;
      system utilizes its medically-supervised genetic algorithm to decide on the outcome of the&#xD;
      genetic counseling. The algorithm takes advantage of all relevant information in the system&#xD;
      including the predictions of the risk calculator BRCAPRO. The outcomes of the system are&#xD;
      either a digital genetic counseling report generator (see next section) or an invitation to a&#xD;
      face-to-face genetic counseling session to receive the results. All women who are found to&#xD;
      harbor a germline mutation in the BRCA1/2 genes will be invited to a face-to-face genetic&#xD;
      counseling session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk Calculators: Provide evidence-based estimation of the risk of the participant to develop&#xD;
      Breast Cancer and Ovarian cancer as well as to be carrier of a mutation in the BRCA1/2 genes.&#xD;
      As mentioned above, risk calculations using a variety of algorithms can be performed before&#xD;
      and after the genetic test. Pretest calculations are done in order to see if risks justify by&#xD;
      law HMO coverage of the genetic test. Post-test run of the calculators aims to provide the&#xD;
      residual risk taking into account the results of the genetic test. The BRCAPRO algorithm is&#xD;
      based on posterior calculations of residual carrier risk, genetic test results, ethnicity,&#xD;
      and pre-existing knowledge of carrier state frequencies in the given population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interface for genetic results: In the current study, the DGC will work only with the results&#xD;
      of the test done at the Sheba MC Oncogenetic laboratory for the 14 BRCA1/2 mutations&#xD;
      prevalent in Israeli population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Counseling Summary Session:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This module is responsible to generate two types of outputs. Low risk participants (namely&#xD;
      individuals that based on their personal and family history in conjunction with the test&#xD;
      results are deemed at a low risk of having an inherited predisposition to cancer) are&#xD;
      approved to receive an automated digital report (personalized video), while high risk&#xD;
      participants are urged to schedule a face-to-face genetic counseling session. In high risk&#xD;
      cases, the genetic counselor will have the digital information provided by the participants&#xD;
      and the genetic test results, to make the counseling process more effective. The threshold of&#xD;
      High/Low risk assignment is determined by the head of the head of Sheba MC Genetic Institute.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Digital Genetic Counseling Report Generator: This component generates an animated,&#xD;
      personalized dynamic video and a written report (in PDF format) summarizing the genetic&#xD;
      counseling provided to the participant online. The report is machine-generated and approved&#xD;
      by medical personnel before its disclosure to the participant. Using the standard two-factor&#xD;
      authentication method based on phone number and the last four digits of the participants' ID&#xD;
      number, the participants will be able to view the personalized video and download the&#xD;
      reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Support for face-to-face Genetic Counseling: The system dashboards will present the genetic&#xD;
      counselor with a full report containing all gathered information to-date, augmented with&#xD;
      digital tools, such as animated videos aimed to facilitate an effective session.&#xD;

    <description>The investigators expect that the pre-test session of all participants will be handled using the enrollment module of the system making the face-to-face session unneeded. In addition, the investigators expect that about 10% of BRCA negative, low risk women that received digital counseling will still request a face-to-face counseling session. Overall, the investigators estimate that the 55% of the women will not require a post-test face-to-face session.</description>
