      Acting early in the process of weakening elders in order to keep them longer in good health&#xD;
      and socially active is possible. During the past decade, museums have become involved in the&#xD;
      care of patients by using art to improve their quality of life and well-being. Museums have,&#xD;
      thus, emerged as new partners in public health. Very few programs developed by museums have&#xD;
      focused on elders. Only one focused on elders in situation of early frailty and demonstrated&#xD;
      that it was possible, through participatory visual art-based activities, to improve the&#xD;
      health status of elders living at home.&#xD;
