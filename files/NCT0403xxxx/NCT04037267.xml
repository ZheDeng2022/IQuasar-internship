  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) accounts for about 20% of intracerebral hemorrhage, but its&#xD;
      mortality rate is as high as 50%-80%. External ventricular drainage (EVD) can rapidly reduce&#xD;
      intracranial pressure, but clinical practice found that drainage catheters are often blocked&#xD;
      by blood clots and long-term thrombolytic therapy is likely to cause secondary bleeding. The&#xD;
      application of neuroendoscopy in IVH has attracted more and more attention in recent years.&#xD;
      Studies have shown that the use of neuroendoscopy for IVH evacuation (with EVD) has&#xD;
      advantages over EVD alone. However, the cases of most current research are small and all of&#xD;
      them are retrospective studies, which means lacking prospective clinical studies to provide&#xD;
      high-quality evidence. Based on this, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled,&#xD;
      multi-center clinical trial to compare the prognosis of patients who undergo endoscopic IVH&#xD;
      evacuation surgery versus those who undergo external ventricular drainage for moderate to&#xD;
      severe IVH.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Spontaneous Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) is defined as bleeding into the cerebral&#xD;
      ventricular system caused by spontaneous rupture of brain arteries, veins and capillaries&#xD;
      instead of trauma. IVH accounts for about 20% of cerebral hemorrhage, but its mortality rate&#xD;
      is as high as 50%-80%. According to the results of the STICH trial, the prognosis of patients&#xD;
      with IVH is worse than that of patients without IVH (p&lt;0.00001); if patients with IVH have&#xD;
      hydrocephalus, the prognosis is the worst.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the edition of 2015 Chinese multidisciplinary experts' consensus for spontaneous&#xD;
      cerebral hemorrhage diagnosis and treatment and 2015 AHA/ASA spontaneous cerebral hemorrhage&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment guidelines, for patients with small amount of IVH without obstructive&#xD;
      hydrocephalus, conservative treatment or continuous lumbar drainage can be effective. For&#xD;
      patients with large amount of IVH (hematoma occupying more than 50% of the lateral ventricle,&#xD;
      secondary obstructive hydrocephalus or obviously increased intracranial pressure), the&#xD;
      occupancy effect is dramatic and patients are prone to suffering from hydrocephalus and&#xD;
      cerebral palsy, in which circumstances urgent evacuation of hematoma is required, but it is&#xD;
      controversial whether it is beneficial for the patients and whether it can improve the&#xD;
      prognosis of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the regular treatment for IVH, external ventricular drainage (EVD) can rapidly reduce&#xD;
      intracranial pressure, but clinical practice found that drainage catheters are often blocked&#xD;
      by blood clots, and long-term thrombolytic therapy is likely to cause secondary bleeding.&#xD;
      Usually, the catheters need to be removed or replaced one week after placement as for the&#xD;
      increasing risk of infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The application of endoscopy in IVH has attracted more and more attention. Studies have shown&#xD;
      that the use of endoscopy for IVH evacuation (with EVD) has advantages over EVD alone. The&#xD;
      incidence of postoperative hydrocephalus and the need for ventricular-peritoneal shunt&#xD;
      surgery is lower. However, the cases of most current research are small and all of them are&#xD;
      retrospective studies. There are no such clinical trials registered at home and abroad, and&#xD;
      that is, there is a lack of prospective high-quality clinical studies to further demonstrate&#xD;
      the effect of endoscopic treatment for IVH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on this, we intend to conduct a randomized, controlled, multi-center clinical trial to&#xD;
      compare the prognosis of patients who undergo endoscopic IVH evacuation surgery versus those&#xD;
      who undergo external ventricular drainage for moderate to severe IVH.&#xD;

    <description>Endoscopy was performed using a rigid endoscope. The hematoma was removed by a technique using irrigation and aspiration. The ventricular drainage catheter was placed on the surgical side. Six hours after surgery, we administered 20,000 U urokinase with 5 ml saline every 8 hours through the catheter and the catheter was closed for 1 hour to allow drug-clot interaction and then reopened to allow for gravitational drainage. Subsequent CT scans were done for any safety concern or every 24 hours. Administration of urokinase was stopped when the CT scans showed that the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is unobstructed. When CT scans showed that the intracerebral hematoma was significantly reduced and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is unobstructed, the catheter could be clamped for 24 h. If there was no acute intracranial pressure increase, the catheter could then be removed.</description>

    <description>The surgeons used a soft catheter to puncture in depth of about 5 cm. The next step was to fix the drainage catheter. Postoperative CT was done immediately to confirm positioning of the soft catheter and stability of the hematoma. Six hours or more after catheter placement, we administered 20,000 U urokinase with 5 ml saline every 8 hours and the catheter was closed for 1 h to allow drug-clot interaction and then reopened to allow for gravitational drainage. Subsequent CT scans were done for any safety concern or every 24 hours. Administration of urokinase was stopped when the CT scans showed that the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is unobstructed. When CT scans showed that the intracerebral hematoma was significantly reduced and the circulation of cerebrospinal fluid is unobstructed, the catheter could be clamped for 24 h. If there was no acute intracranial pressure increase, the catheter could then be removed.</description>
