  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Obesity is characterized by excessive white adipose tissue (WAT) that increases risk for&#xD;
      disease. About 700 million adults are obese worldwide, designating the need of reducing&#xD;
      excessive WAT in humans and subsequently the risk for disease. For this reason, previous&#xD;
      research focused on the thermogenic capacity of white adipocytes in response to chronic&#xD;
      exercise. It is suggested that the latter occurs due to increased demand of oxidation during&#xD;
      exercise to maintain non-esterified fatty acids flux in the circulation, thus to maintain&#xD;
      energy supply White adipocytes express the uncoupling protein one (UCP1), which dissipates&#xD;
      chemical energy in the mitochondria to produce heat in response to cold exposure. UCP1 was&#xD;
      thought that exclusively appears in brown adipose tissue (BAT), which during the&#xD;
      mitochondrial electron transport chain process, bypasses the adenosine triphosphate (ATP)&#xD;
      synthase to produce heat, as a thermoregulatory mechanism of maintaining body temperature.&#xD;
      Its presence in white adipocytes, indicates a thermogenic capacity of WAT, which could lead&#xD;
      to similar health benefits as those reported for increased BAT activity; mainly reduced body&#xD;
      mass index (BMI) and fat mass, which designate body weight loss and reduced obesity&#xD;
      phenotype.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aimed to identify whether UCP1 in human WAT is altered by chronic exercise.&#xD;

      The investigators obtained three (baseline, post-exercise, post-de-training) subcutaneous fat&#xD;
      biopsies from 32 healthy men who undertook three different eight week exercise programs&#xD;
      [aerobic (9 participants), resistance (8 participants), combined (aerobic+resistance, 8&#xD;
      participants)] and a non-exercise group (7 participants), followed by an eight week&#xD;
      de-training period. Exercise intensity was set at 65% of peak oxygen consumption (VO2peak)&#xD;
      and 1 repetition maximum (1RM) throughout the exercise period, while the content of the&#xD;
      exercise programs based on a previous study that examined the PGC1a gene, which is thought&#xD;
      that increases UCP1 in human white adipose tissue (WAT). Exercise performed in three local&#xD;
      gyms in Trikala, Thessaly, Greece, each for every exercise group to avoid cross-contamination&#xD;
      between participants, while the exercise supervisors were blinded to the aim of the study.&#xD;
      Measurements for anthropometry, body composition, resting energy expenditure (REE), and&#xD;
      subcutaneous fat biopsy were obtained at baseline, post-exercise (week 8) and post&#xD;
      de-training (week 16) periods while diet data were randomly collected for two weekdays and&#xD;
      one weekend day at baseline, 8th and 16th week. VO2peak and 1RM were measured at baseline,&#xD;
      4th (to adjust the required exercise intensity at 65%), 8th and 16th week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anthropometry The participants visited the laboratory between 07:00 and 09:00 am and the&#xD;
      following anthropometry measures took part: Height was measured using a Seca (Hamburg,&#xD;
      Germany) device and weight using a scale (KERN &amp; Sohn GmbH, Version 5.3, Germany) while&#xD;
      waist-to-hip ratio was measured using a tape measure and blood pressure through an acoustic&#xD;
      method using an Aneroid sphygmomanometer. Percent body fat and fat-free mass were measured&#xD;
      via bioelectrical impedance using a body composition monitor (Fresenius Medical Care AG &amp; Co.&#xD;
      KGaA D-61346 Bad Hamburg, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fat biopsies All biopsies were executed by an experienced surgeon following a previous&#xD;
      methodology via a non-diathermy method. The participants underwent a subcutaneous fat biopsy&#xD;
      after at least an eight hour fast and they were instructed to refrain from exercise, alcohol,&#xD;
      and passive smoking in 72 hours prior the biopsy procedure in order to minimize the risk for&#xD;
      misleading results. Each participant was positioned on a surgical bed in a supine position.&#xD;
      The site of the incision was disinfected and a 10 ml of xylocaine 2%-no adrenaline was&#xD;
      injected in the region of the incision for local anaesthesia. An incision on the skin and&#xD;
      subcutaneous tissue until adipose tissue was revealed, was executed approximately 3-5&#xD;
      centimetres nearby the navel while the incision length was approximately 2-2.5 centimetres.&#xD;
      Subsequently, the subcutaneous tissue was removed with an operating scissors and when the&#xD;
      adipose tissue became visible nearly 500 milligrams of adipose tissue was captured and&#xD;
      removed. The collected adipose tissue was immediately immersed in liquid nitrogen of -190°&#xD;
      Celsius. For the final deposition the samples were placed in Eppendorfs and they were&#xD;
      deposited in a freezer at -80° Celsius until analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UCP1 mRNA analysis The investigators who performed the gene and protein expression analyses&#xD;
      were blinded to the aim of the study. Total RNA was extracted from adipose tissue biopsies&#xD;
      using RNeasy Lipid Tissue mini kit (QIAGEN) following the manufacturer's protocol.&#xD;
      First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from equal amounts of total RNA using random primers and&#xD;
      M-MLV reverse transcriptase (Promega). Quantitative real time polymerase chain reaction for&#xD;
      the UCP1 gene was performed using Sybr Green fluorophore. The change in fluorescence at every&#xD;
      cycle was monitored and a threshold cycle above background for each reaction was calculated.&#xD;
      A melt curve analysis was performed following every run to ensure a single amplified product&#xD;
      for every reaction. All reactions were carried out in at least duplicated for every sample.&#xD;
      18S rRNA gene was constantly expressed under all experimental conditions and was then used as&#xD;
      a reference gene for normalization given that this gene was suggested as the most appropriate&#xD;
      one for normalization of UCP1 mRNA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      UCP1 protein analysis Subcutaneous adipose tissue was homogenized in RIPA Lysis Buffer with&#xD;
      protease inhibitors (Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy), centrifuged at 800g for 10 minutes at 4°&#xD;
      Celsius and then the middle layer was collected. Equal amounts (50 micrograms) of proteins&#xD;
      were separated on 10% SDS-polyacrylamide gel, transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. UCP1&#xD;
      from subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were detected by primary antibodies, respectively&#xD;
      rabbit polyclonal anti-human UCP1 (1:1000, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy) and mouse monoclonal&#xD;
      anti-human β-actin (1:5000, Sigma-Aldrich, Milan, Italy). Secondary antibodies were&#xD;
      peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG for UCP1 and anti-mouse IgG for β-actin. Human&#xD;
      adipocytes that treated with 100uM menthol were used as positive controls for UCP1 protein&#xD;
      expression according to previous methodology. Western blotting analysis was performed using&#xD;
      Immobilion Western Chemiluminescent HRP Substrate (Millipore) and detection was made using&#xD;
      photographic films. The images have been analysed by densitometry, which evaluates the&#xD;
      relative amount of protein staining and quantifies the results in terms of optical density.&#xD;
&#xD;
      REE assessments REE assessments were conducted between 07:00 to 09:00 am following 12 hours&#xD;
      of fast, while participants refrained from exercise, alcohol, and passive smoking in 72 hours&#xD;
      prior to the measurements. REE was measured using an automated gas analyzer (Vmax,&#xD;
      CareFusion, USA) that was attached to the participants to record respiratory variables every&#xD;
      20 seconds in a supine position for 30 minutes in a quiet room of 22-24° Celsius. From the 30&#xD;
      minutes of the collected data, the first and last five minutes were removed. Finally, the&#xD;
      remaining 20 minutes of the collected data were averaged to obtain the final REE (calories)&#xD;
      value. Respiratory gas measurements were extracted using the Weir equation to convert VO2 and&#xD;
      VCO2 values to REE (calories) values. To ensure accuracy of the REE measurements the average&#xD;
      respiratory exchange ratio was also verified according to previous methodology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VO2peak and 1RM assessments At baseline, a pre-screening was performed for each participant&#xD;
      to identify their eligibility to undertake a VO2peak test using the Physical Activity&#xD;
      Readiness Questionnaire. To ensure the familiarization of the participants with the VO2peak&#xD;
      test a detailed verbal description of the protocol was given in advance. The protocol&#xD;
      involved a five minute warm-up and a familiarization period of a cycling in a Monark&#xD;
      Ergomedic 839E, Vansbro, Sweden. Consequently, the test involved a three minute of pedaling&#xD;
      at 60 revolutions per minute at 60 Watts followed by an increment of 30 Watts/minute until&#xD;
      volitional exhaustion. An automated gas analyzer (Vmax, CareFusion, USA) was attached to the&#xD;
      participants to record respiratory variables every 20 seconds. The highest oxygen uptake&#xD;
      (milliliters/minute) for any 20 second interval was recorded as the final VO2peak value.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1RM of leg extension and chest press were tested as following: A suitable weight was&#xD;
      adjusted for each participant in order to not be able to lift it for no more than 10&#xD;
      repetitions. The number of the repetitions were then calculated and a norm was used to&#xD;
      predict the 1RM using the weight in kilograms that each participant lifted and the number of&#xD;
      the repetitions that were performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Diet assessment Participants were randomly contacted by telephone - by an independent&#xD;
      assistant who was blinded to the aim of the study - on three separate days (two weekdays, one&#xD;
      weekend day) during a week period for the completion of a three-day diet record. All food and&#xD;
      beverages consumed on the day of contact were recorded. Three-day diet records were collected&#xD;
      at baseline, 8th and 16th week of the intervention. All diet records were analyzed by another&#xD;
      trained assistant who was blinded to the aim of the study using Nutritionist Pro, Version&#xD;
      5.4.0, Axxya Systems (Redmond, WA, USA). This software (i.e. Nutritionist Pro) has been&#xD;
      previously used for research purposes. For the analysis, a search was conducted in&#xD;
      Nutritionist Pro for each food and beverage consumed. Details regarding the amount and&#xD;
      preparation of each food and/or beverage were also included. Once all the relevant&#xD;
      information regarding the food or beverage was entered into the software, a corresponding&#xD;
      list of macro and micro-nutrient content was provided and subsequently saved. This process&#xD;
      was repeated for all food and beverages listed on the diet record. If a particular food or&#xD;
      beverage was not found within the Nutritionist Pro database, the investigator manually&#xD;
      entered the macro and micro-nutrient content of that particular food and saved it to the&#xD;
      database for future use. The feedback provided by the software for each food or beverage&#xD;
      included the following dietary variables: total energy intake (calories), weight of food&#xD;
      (grammars), protein (grammars), carbohydrate (grammars), total fat (grammars), total sugar&#xD;
      (grammars) and caffeine (micro-grammars).&#xD;
