  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted during the period of, January 2019 - August 2019 with&#xD;
      pre-diabetic participants on a NHS England funded National Diabetes Prevention Program (NDPP)&#xD;
      with a clinically diagnosed Haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) referral reading of between 42mmol/mol -&#xD;
      47mmol/mol within the last 12 months. The term pre-diabetic can all be used to explain blood&#xD;
      glucose levels that are higher than normal, but not high enough for participants to be&#xD;
      diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Having high blood glucose levels can increase a participant's&#xD;
      risk of developing Type 2 diabetes and other health complications, although this is not&#xD;
      inevitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      100 participants will take part in the study. Participants will be eligible if they are aged&#xD;
      between 18 and 65 years and have an HbA1c referral reading of between 42-47mmol/mol within&#xD;
      the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participants will be given a written consent form to sign to take part in the study,&#xD;
      after receiving both written and verbal information beforehand on the study protocol from the&#xD;
      researcher. Health screening to determine eligibility for the NHS funded program will be&#xD;
      undertaken directly by the intervention provider.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design and procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be delivered in a controlled format and will be designed to assess the&#xD;
      relationship between the elevation of HbA1c level, sleep quality and sleep duration in&#xD;
      clinically diagnosed pre-diabetic participants referred and registered to join the NHS NDPP.&#xD;
      Participants will receive a pre-program information pack in conjunction with a sleep quality&#xD;
      and sleep duration questionnaire at the end of their 1:1 initial appointments for the NHS&#xD;
      NDPP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be given prepaid envelopes to send their anonymised questionnaires back to&#xD;
      the researcher once completed after their appointments. The researcher will ensure&#xD;
      confidentiality by keeping all questionnaires in a securely combination coded locked cupboard&#xD;
      that only the researcher has access to. Participants will be instructed to not write their&#xD;
      names on the questionnaires but to only state their gender, age, and referral HbA1c reading&#xD;
      received from the relevant health care professional.&#xD;
