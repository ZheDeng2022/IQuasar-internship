        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Must have the ability to understand and sign a written informed consent form, which&#xD;
             must be obtained prior to initiation of study procedures;&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Male and female subjects,18 years of age and older, based on the date of the screening&#xD;
             visit;&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Suboptimal Responders to Entecavir (defined as CHB patients treated with at least 12&#xD;
             months of ETV 0.5mg QD with prior suboptimal response viral load still detectable at&#xD;
             week 48).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. ETV intolerance population (defined as unwilling or poor adherence to administer ETV&#xD;
             in fasting food, renal impairment with ETV dosage adjustment required, pts with other&#xD;
             unidentified reasons willing to switch, etc);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Screening serum ALT level ≤ 10 × ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Normal ECG (or if abnormal, determined by the Investigator not to be clinically&#xD;
             significant);&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Must be willing and able to comply with all study requirements.&#xD;

&#xD;
          4. Evidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (e.g. as evidenced by recent imaging);&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Abnormal hematological and biochemical parameters, including: Hemoglobin &lt; 10 g/dl,&#xD;
             Absolute neutrophil count &lt; 0.75×109/L, Platelets ≤ 50×109/L, AST or ALT &gt; 10 × ULN,&#xD;
             Total bilirubin &gt; 2.5 × ULN, Albumin &lt; 3.0 g/dl, INR &gt; 1.5 × ULN;&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Received solid organ or bone marrow transplant;&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Recent history of pancreatitis (within 24 weeks prior to the first dose of study&#xD;
             medication);&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Evidence of other autoimmune or metabolic liver diseases (except non-alcoholic fatty&#xD;
             liver disease);&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Significant renal, cardiovascular, pulmonary, or neurological disease in the opinion&#xD;
             of the investigator;&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Malignancy within the 5 years prior to screening, with the exception of specific&#xD;
             cancers that are cured by surgical resection(basal cell skin cancer, etc). Subjects&#xD;
             under evaluation for possible malignancy are not eligible;&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Known hypersensitivity to study drugs, metabolites, or formulation excipients;&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Current alcohol or substance abuse judged by the investigator to potentially interfere&#xD;
             with subject compliance;&#xD;
&#xD;
         13. Any other clinical condition or prior therapy that, in the opinion of the&#xD;
             investigator, would make the subject unsuitable for the study or unable to comply with&#xD;
             dosing requirements.&#xD;
