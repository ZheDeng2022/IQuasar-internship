  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Clostridium difficile (C. difficile) is a major pathogen causing serious&#xD;
      healthcare-associated diarrheal illness in patients. Prevention of healthcare facility-onset&#xD;
      C. difficile infection (CDI) is essential. Many CDI cases are caused by the transmission of&#xD;
      the pathogen from patients who carry the bacteria, but do not have symptoms. However, there&#xD;
      are limited data on how to prevent the transmission of C. difficile from patients who do not&#xD;
      have symptoms. Universal gloving practices - the use of gloves by all healthcare workers for&#xD;
      all patient contacts - may reduce CDI cases. In this study, the investigators will examine&#xD;
      the effectiveness of universal gloving practices as compared to standard of care (use of&#xD;
      gloving for contact only in patients with known CDI or other infections). The investigators&#xD;
      will compare the effects of these practices on the transmission of C. difficile within&#xD;
      participating hospital units to determine if universal gloving is an effective practice to&#xD;
      prevent healthcare-associated CDI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Background: Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) has become the most common&#xD;
      healthcare-associated infection (HAI) in US hospitals, causing approximately 500,000&#xD;
      infections and 30,000 deaths per year. Prevention of healthcare-onset (HO) CDI has quickly&#xD;
      become a priority for many hospitals. Hospital prevention measures are limited to modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors (i.e., prudent antibiotic use and limiting exposure to C. difficile). Hospital&#xD;
      exposure to C. difficile can occur directly (i.e., hands or clothing of healthcare workers)&#xD;
      or indirectly (i.e., environmental surfaces or shared equipment), so infection prevention&#xD;
      measures focus on healthcare worker hand hygiene, barrier precautions (use of gowns and&#xD;
      gloves) and cleaning of the hospital environment and reusable medical equipment. However,&#xD;
      these interventions are limited to symptomatic patients who test positive for CDI.&#xD;
      Asymptomatic patients serve as a reservoir for cross-contamination, but microbiological&#xD;
      screening for asymptomatic carriage of C. difficile is not routinely performed in healthcare.&#xD;
      Gloving for all patient contacts may interrupt transmission from asymptomatic patients&#xD;
      colonized with C. difficile.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives: The overall purpose of the study is to determine the effectiveness of healthcare&#xD;
      worker use of gloves for all patient contact (universal gloving) on reducing acquisition of&#xD;
      C. difficile and hospital-onset CDI in inpatient hospital units. The main objective of the&#xD;
      study is to compare the effects of universal gloving for all patient contact to the current&#xD;
      standard of care (i.e., glove and gown use only for known CDI cases). The specific aims are:&#xD;
      1) compare the effects of universal gloving for all patient contact to the current standard&#xD;
      of care on C. difficile acquisition rates in hospitalized patients; 2) compare the effects of&#xD;
      universal gloving compared to standard of care on CDI rates, other HAI rates, 30-day&#xD;
      mortality, and unit length of stay; and 3) evaluate intervention fidelity, cost, and&#xD;
      stakeholder experiences with universal gloving.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The study will be a cluster randomized trial (CRT) in ten inpatient VA hospital&#xD;
      units. Hospital units will be randomized either to implement universal gloving intervention&#xD;
      or to continue standard of care. The universal gloving intervention will consist of all&#xD;
      healthcare workers (nurses, providers, respiratory therapists, radiology and laboratory&#xD;
      technicians, etc) utilizing gloves for all patient contacts in the units that are randomized&#xD;
      to receive the intervention. The non-intervention units will follow standard of care which&#xD;
      consists of healthcare workers using gowns and gloves only for patients with known CDI and&#xD;
      other infections (e.g., MRSA). Unit-level data will be collected, including C. difficile&#xD;
      acquisition and infection rates, mortality, length of stay, barrier precaution compliance,&#xD;
      and end-user perceptions.&#xD;
