      1.0 BACKGROUND, RATIONALE Since the turn of the century, opioid prescriptions and&#xD;
      opioid-related overdose deaths in the United States has been on the rise, and is seen as the&#xD;
      main cause of the consecutive decrease in life expectancy seen in 2015-2016. This epidemic&#xD;
      has been declared a Public Health Emergency by the Department of Health and Human Services&#xD;
      (HHS), with approximately 115 people dying daily from opioid-related drug overdoses&#xD;
      nationwide. Over 40% of these overdoses are associated with prescription opioid abuse.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While non-medical opioid use is seen most commonly in those aged 15-24, accidental opioid&#xD;
      overdose rates are highest in the those aged 45-54, an age group in which the medical use of&#xD;
      opioids is most common. For many adults, their first medical exposure to opioids is following&#xD;
      a surgical procedure. New persistent opioid use has been identified following both minor and&#xD;
      major surgical procedures in 5.9% to 6.5% of patients, and was associated with behavioral and&#xD;
      pain disorders rather than surgical pain itself. Furthermore, prolonged opioid use beyond 5&#xD;
      days, and even more so when the prescription exceeds 10 days, has been associated with an&#xD;
      increased probability of continued long term opioid use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better pain management strategies and better research are key strategies the HHS have&#xD;
      identified to combat the growing opioid epidemic. Current prescription patterns in the US are&#xD;
      highly variable, although initiatives have been put into place to develop evidence based&#xD;
      guidelines. Prescription opioid use has previously been linked to improved patient&#xD;
      satisfaction with care, and in a study of primary care providers, those physicians who were&#xD;
      incentivized by patient satisfaction scores reported an increased impact of these scores on&#xD;
      their opioid prescribing practices. However, multiple studies have revealed no correlation&#xD;
      between patient satisfaction scores and the amount of postoperative opioids prescribed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A systematic review of studies describing opioid oversupply after surgery reported that&#xD;
      67-92% of patients reported unused opioids with few storing or disposing of excessive pills&#xD;
      in an appropriate manner. Multiple studies have looked at interventions on the provider side,&#xD;
      in order to minimize opioid prescriptions and thus minimize the availability of excess&#xD;
      opioids that may facilitate opioid dependence and diversion into the community. While there&#xD;
      has been an almost universal reduction in opioids prescribed, fewer studies have demonstrated&#xD;
      a reduction in actual opioids taken by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hill et al identified in 642 patients undergoing 5 common outpatient procedures a wide&#xD;
      variation in the number of opioid pills prescribed and identified an ideal number of opioid&#xD;
      pills per procedure that would adequate treat postoperative pain in the majority of patients,&#xD;
      a number that was typically less than 50% of what was historically prescribed. The same group&#xD;
      then presented their findings at their institution and recommended prescribers to encourage&#xD;
      patients to use nonopioid analgesics. They found that following this education, there was a&#xD;
      significant reduction in number of opioid pills prescribed across all procedures and also a&#xD;
      decrease in the mean number of pills taken by patients following inguinal hernia and partial&#xD;
      mastectomy with sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Howard et al reported a decrease in median amount of opioids prescribed for laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy from 250mg to 75mg following the development and education of physicians on&#xD;
      evidence based prescribing guidelines. This was associated with no increase in the frequency&#xD;
      of refill requests and a median postoperative opioid use reduction from 30mg to 20mg without&#xD;
      a change in pain score. Similar results were seen in a group of oncology patients undergoing&#xD;
      breast and melanoma procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have also incorporated preoperative patient education about expected&#xD;
      postoperative recovery and pain management strategies. However, most of these studies have&#xD;
      been retrospectively performed in the context of quality improvement projects, with the&#xD;
      comparison of preinterventional and postinterventional cohorts of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Shindo et al in a retrospective cohort study of patients undergoing thyroid and parathyroid&#xD;
      surgery reported a significant decrease in the amount of opioids prescribed following an&#xD;
      intervention including preoperative patient counselling regarding pain management, the use of&#xD;
      multimodality nonopioid pain management and the education of nurses and physicians. Prabhu et&#xD;
      al took a shared decision-making approach to opioid prescribing utilizing a tablet computer&#xD;
      based decision aid and found that patients who participated chose a 50% decreased in the&#xD;
      number of opioids prescribed postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Holman et al performed a retrospective cohort study on orthopedic trauma patients and found&#xD;
      that patients who were instructed at the time of index procedure that they would receive&#xD;
      prescription opioids for a maximum of 6 weeks were significantly more likely to have stopped&#xD;
      using opioids by that time, although this effect was lost at 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prospective studies evaluating the effects of these interventions have been fewer. Hartford&#xD;
      et al developed a 4-pronged opioid intervention involving the implementation of patient&#xD;
      education, healthcare provider education, intraoperative and postoperative multimodal&#xD;
      analgesia with opioid reduction strategies in patients undergoing laparoscopic&#xD;
      cholecystectomy or open hernia repair and evaluated their results prospectively. They found&#xD;
      no difference in patient reported average postoperative pain scores but improvements in&#xD;
      patient reported pain control. They also found a decrease in the number of opioids prescribed&#xD;
      by the provider and ultimately filled by the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sugai et al randomized patients who underwent outpatient aesthetic surgery to preoperative&#xD;
      education on how the body responds to pain and the side effects of opioids. Compared with&#xD;
      patients who did not receive education in whom 100% filled their opioid prescription, they&#xD;
      found that 90% of patients who received education declined a postoperative opioid&#xD;
      prescription. Furthermore, patients in the control group had significantly greater&#xD;
      postoperative average pain scores and a significantly longer duration of pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Alter et al performed a prospective randomized controlled trial of patients undergoing carpal&#xD;
      tunnel release surgery and found that patients randomized to formal preoperative opioid&#xD;
      counseling had reduced postoperative opioid consumption compared with patients without&#xD;
      counselling (1.4 vs 4.2 opioid pills).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While preoperative patient education is undoubtedly useful, there is also an opportunity to&#xD;
      monitor patients postoperatively and provide real-time feedback and reinforcement about pain&#xD;
      management strategies and appropriate opioid use. The investigators have previously assessed&#xD;
      real-time postoperative pain and opioid use in patients undergoing thyroid and parathyroid&#xD;
      surgery utilizing a novel SMS survey (Chen et al, unpublished data). Overall response rate&#xD;
      was &gt;80% and the investigators were able to identify risk factors for patients who had&#xD;
      prolonged opioid use, beyond what was expected after thyroid and parathyroid surgery.&#xD;
      Although no intervention was performed in this study, it could potentially help identify&#xD;
      patients in whom closer follow-up and earlier intervention might be beneficial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators theorize that real-time feedback and education about appropriate opioid use&#xD;
      postoperatively may lead to a reduction in actual opioids consumed by the patient. The&#xD;
      investigators propose a prospective randomized controlled trial to evaluate this in patients&#xD;
      undergoing elective outpatient surgery.&#xD;
