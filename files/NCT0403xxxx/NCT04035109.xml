    <textblock>
      Participants with mild asthma who are sensitized to either house dust mite or cat hair&#xD;
      allergen will undergo nasal instillation of the allergen to elicit nasal allergy symptoms.&#xD;
      The participants will be treated in a cross-over fashion with either placebo (saline) or&#xD;
      anakinra to determine if anakinra will reduce nasal airway eosinophil recruitment, eosinophil&#xD;
      activation, release of inflammatory mediators, mucins, and gene expression changes in&#xD;
      epithelial cells.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Asthma is an increasingly common chronic illness with higher rates of hospitalization for&#xD;
      exacerbation than many other chronic conditions. In 2009, total asthma costs in the U.S. were&#xD;
      estimated at $56 billion per year, and over half the overall asthma-related costs were&#xD;
      attributed to inpatient hospitalization. Allergen exposure and viral infection are among the&#xD;
      most common triggers for asthma exacerbations. Exacerbations of allergic asthma are&#xD;
      characterized by an early phase response, mediated by release of preformed mediators like&#xD;
      histamine from mast cells, and a late phase response 3-7 hours later mediated by chemokines&#xD;
      and cytokines, including IL-1beta (IL-1b), that attract leukocytes such as neutrophils and&#xD;
      eosinophils to the airways, increase mucus production, trigger airway smooth muscle&#xD;
      contraction, and result in airway constriction and airway hyper-reactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While corticosteroids are considered a mainstay of treatment for asthma exacerbation&#xD;
      regardless of the trigger, there are limitations to their effectiveness in the acute setting&#xD;
      including the initial lag period of 4-6 hours or more before therapeutic effect and the&#xD;
      concern for broad immune suppression. Corticosteroids are often ineffective in treating the&#xD;
      neutrophilic component of airway inflammation seen with allergen-induced airway inflammation.&#xD;
      Time to therapeutic benefit is key in preventing patient morbidity and mortality. Currently&#xD;
      there is an urgent need for anti-inflammatory treatments that work quickly and effectively in&#xD;
      acute asthma exacerbations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose that IL-1 blockade can achieve these ends and perhaps complement&#xD;
      corticosteroid actions. Anakinra is an FDA-approved recombinant form of human IL-1 receptor&#xD;
      antagonist (IL-1RA), a natural anti-inflammatory cytokine that competes with agonist binding&#xD;
      to the IL-1 receptor, suppressing IL-1b and IL-1a signaling. Numerous murine and in vitro&#xD;
      studies indicate that IL-1 signaling mediates key features of allergen-induced airway&#xD;
      inflammation, including eosinophil recruitment and mucin production.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IL-1 receptor activity is important for eosinophil airway recruitment after allergen&#xD;
      challenge through inducing endothelial cell adhesiveness and through increased mRNA&#xD;
      expression of the eosinophil chemokine, eotaxin in pulmonary epithelial cells. IL-1 receptor&#xD;
      type 1 (IL-1R1)-deficient mice demonstrate reduced allergic (eosinophilic) lung inflammation.&#xD;
      Most pertinent to this project, anakinra treatment of wild type BALB/c mice prior to OVA&#xD;
      challenge severely dampened airway eosinophil recruitment, cytokine responses, airway&#xD;
      resistance and goblet cell numbers. In humans undergoing nasal allergen challenge, nasal&#xD;
      secretions showed a biphasic pattern of IL-1b secretion that coincided with the early phase&#xD;
      and late phase allergic responses. These data collectively suggest that IL-1 signaling is&#xD;
      important in the allergic eosinophilic response and that anakinra has high potential to&#xD;
      reduce eosinophilic inflammation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mucus accumulation is also a feature of allergen-induced inflammation and likely results from&#xD;
      hypersecretion of mucus and failure of the mucociliary apparatus to effectively clear this&#xD;
      mucus and airway debris. MUC5B and MUC5AC are the major secreted mucins in the human&#xD;
      respiratory tract. IL-1b alone has been shown to induce increased epithelial cell mRNA&#xD;
      expression of the mucin genes MUC5B and MUC5AC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anakinra is an ideal candidate to test as a rescue treatment for acute allergic inflammation&#xD;
      due to its fast onset of action (reaching peak concentrations in 3-7 hours), and a short 4-6&#xD;
      hour half-life. Our objective is to determine if one treatment of anakinra mitigates a).&#xD;
      eosinophil activation and recruitment and b) mucin secretion, after nasal allergen challenge,&#xD;
      to ultimately assess if anakinra can mitigate key inflammatory features of asthma&#xD;
      exacerbations. We expect that anakinra treatment will reduce nasal airway eosinophil&#xD;
      recruitment, eosinophil activation, release of inflammatory mediators, mucins, and gene&#xD;
      expression changes in epithelial cells after nasal allergen challenge based on pre-clinical&#xD;
      data using anakinra with OVA challenge.&#xD;
