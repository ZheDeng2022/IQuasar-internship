      Authors design a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study to identify the findings of&#xD;
      thoracic point-of-care ultrasound in patients with acute pancreatitis. Patients will be&#xD;
      included in the study since August through December 2019, admitted to the University&#xD;
      Hospital, &quot;Dr. José E. González&quot;, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo León. These patients will&#xD;
      undergo a pulmonary and vena cava ultrasound at admission, at 24 and 48 hours. The authors&#xD;
      will describe findings of pulmonary ultrasound and their correlation with severity in&#xD;
      patients with acute pancreatitis of all etiologies. The authors will analyze variables such&#xD;
      Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, severity according to the revised Atlanta criteria&#xD;
      (2012), and systemic complications.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Acute pancreatitis has been described as the most common cause of pancreatic disease with a&#xD;
      global incidence of 33-74 per 100.000 people and a mortality of 1-16 per 100.000. Hydration&#xD;
      with the purpose of preventing hypovolemia and hypoperfusion of organs is the cornerstone of&#xD;
      initial disease management. &quot;Aggressive&quot; hydration, has been based on animal models and&#xD;
      observational data from clinical studies, and has been associated with respiratory&#xD;
      complications, compartment syndrome, sepsis, and mortality. Nowadays pulmonary ultrasound has&#xD;
      been used in a wide array of clinical settings such as intensive care unit, emergency&#xD;
      medicine, and nephrology. It has been a standardized tool in internal and pulmonary medicine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Authors design a prospective, longitudinal, descriptive study to identify the findings of&#xD;
      thoracic point-of-care ultrasound in patients with acute pancreatitis. Patients will be&#xD;
      included in the study since August through December 2019, admitted to the University&#xD;
      Hospital, &quot;Dr. José E. González&quot;, Universidad Autonoma de Nuevo León.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Describe findings of pulmonary ultrasound and their correlation with severity in&#xD;
           patients with acute pancreatitis of all etiologies. The authors will analyze variables&#xD;
           such Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, severity according to the revised Atlanta&#xD;
           criteria (2012), and systemic complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. to correlate the number of B-type lines measured by thoracic point-of-care&#xD;
                ultrasound with severity in patients with acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. to correlate the diameter in centimeters of inferior vena cava measured by thoracic&#xD;
                point-of-care ultrasound with severity in patients with acute pancreatitis&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. to correlate the inferior vena cava diameter with the 48 hours post-admission&#xD;
                mortality rate in patients with acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN Prospective, transversal, descriptive.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECTS AND METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients:&#xD;
&#xD;
           In the time period of August 2019 through December 2019 the authors will include&#xD;
           patients with pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The investigators will include all patients that attend the Emergency department of&#xD;
           Hospital Universitario, &quot;Dr. José Eleuterio González&quot; U.A.N.L, with a diagnosis of acute&#xD;
           pancreatitis of all causes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Patients with diagnosis of acute pancreatitis by means of clinical presentation,&#xD;
                laboratory results and/or imaging.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Both genders.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. All etiologies of pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Ages above 18.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Exclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. History of acute pancreatitis in prior 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Patients with referrals from other institutions.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. Patients with other chronic comorbidities such as renal or cardiac insufficiency.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Patients with acute pancreatitis and high suspicion of cholangitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patients with acute pancreatitis and acute cholecystitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             6. Pregnant patients with acute pancreatitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Patients who decline being part of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will study all patients who come to the emergency room of the hospital with&#xD;
      diagnosis of Acute Pancreatitis. Patients will undergo a pulmonary and vena cava ultrasound&#xD;
      at admission, at 24 and 48 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ultrasound will be performed bilateral intercostal with the patient in supine decubitus with&#xD;
      the head at 30 degrees, after the application of acoustic gel on the skin. To improve&#xD;
      imaging, the intercostal spaces will be extended by raising the ipsilateral arm of each&#xD;
      patient to the level of the head or above it during the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each hemithorax is divided into 4 areas: anterior and lateral, superior and inferior. For&#xD;
      each hemithorax, the anterior area was delineated between the clavicle and the diaphragm and&#xD;
      from the parasternal line to the anterior axillary line. The lateral area was delineated&#xD;
      between the axilla and the diaphragm and from the anterior to the posterior axillary line.&#xD;
      The upper quadrants were demarcated from the 1st to the 3rd intercostal space and the lower&#xD;
      quadrants from the 4th to the 6th intercostal space. A total of 8 areas of the chest will be&#xD;
      visualized during normal breathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Findings that will be reported upon pulmonary ultrasound:&#xD;
&#xD;
      B lines: They are hydro-aerial artifacts in comet tail image, begin at the pleural line, are&#xD;
      hyperechoic, well defined, disseminated towards the end of the screen, delete A lines , and&#xD;
      accompany pleural movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lines separated from each other around 7 mm correspond to interstitial edema, while those&#xD;
      that distance 3 mm indicate the presence of alveolar edema. The presence of more than 3 B&#xD;
      lines indicate the presence of an alveolar-interstitial syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pleural effusion: It is visualized as a space free of echoes (anechoic image, &quot;black&quot;)&#xD;
      between the visceral pleura (pulmonary line), together with the parietal pleura (pleural&#xD;
      line) and the shadow of the ribs. In M mode, the movement of the lung line or the visceral&#xD;
      pleura to the pleural line or the parietal pleura upon inspiration is shown, creating the&#xD;
      sinusoidal sign.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurement of the inferior Vena cava:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravascular volume status will be assessed by measuring the diameter and percentage of&#xD;
      collapse of the inferior vena cava. It is performed in the subxiphoid window with the&#xD;
      identification of the four cardiac chambers, then a 90º turn of the transducer is made in the&#xD;
      cephalad direction, which shows the right atrium, the mouth of the vena cava and the hepatic&#xD;
      gland above it. To measure its diameter, it will be beyond the confluence point of the&#xD;
      hepatic veins, which is usually found approximately 2 cm from the mouth of the inferior vena&#xD;
      cava-right atrium. Based on the measurement and collapse of the IVC, volemic state will be&#xD;
      defined in a patient with spontaneous breathing as follows: a diameter of the Inferior cava&#xD;
      vein &lt;2 cm that collapses&gt; 50% suggests lack of volume; however, a diameter of the Inferior&#xD;
      cava vein &gt; 2 cm that collapses &lt;50% suggests a hypervolemic state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The authors will analyze variables such Systemic inflammatory response syndrome, severity&#xD;
      according to the revised Atlanta criteria (2012), and systemic complications.&#xD;
