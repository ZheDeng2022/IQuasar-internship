    <textblock>
      The primary goal of the proposed study is to improve the long-term swallowing capabilities of&#xD;
      subjects undergoing radical or modified radical neck surgeries followed by chemoradiation&#xD;
      therapy (CRT), by more selective stimulation of the swallowing muscles using implanted&#xD;
      microstimulators called BIONs.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Disseminated head and neck cancer is a serious, often life-threatening medical problem that&#xD;
      requires immediate and heroic therapeutic intervention. Treatment typically begins with&#xD;
      extensive surgery followed as soon as possible by an intense series of radiation and&#xD;
      chemotherapy treatments. Typically the patient has recovered sufficiently from the surgery by&#xD;
      2-4 weeks to withstand the new assaults that will result from chemoradiation therapy (CRT),&#xD;
      which kills cancer cells, but also causes muscle atrophy and scarring that can permanently&#xD;
      ruin the swallowing apparatus. Thus, the majority of patients who undergo CRT develop severe&#xD;
      swallowing problems, called dysphagia, that typically becomes worse by about 3-4 weeks&#xD;
      following the beginning of CRT. In anticipation of all of these problems, subjects have a&#xD;
      tube placed in the stomach (gastrostomy tube) so that they can be fed through the tube in the&#xD;
      immediate postoperative period when the incision is fragile and when dysphagia develops&#xD;
      during CRT. Clearly the management of dysphagia during CRT is of primary importance to the&#xD;
      prognosis of the patient. Recent studies have shown that electrical activation of swallowing&#xD;
      muscles during and after CRT can improve the prognosis by reducing dysphagia, but currently&#xD;
      available technology requires the current to be applied transcutaneously. Thus, large&#xD;
      electrical currents must be applied to the damaged skin, and the electrical stimulation that&#xD;
      results is uncomfortable, diffuse and uncontrolled. It is difficult with this approach to&#xD;
      stimulate the deepest muscles that are the preferred targets for the stimulation. The primary&#xD;
      goal of the proposed study is to improve the long-term swallowing capabilities of subjects&#xD;
      undergoing radical or modified radical neck surgeries followed by CRT, by more selective&#xD;
      stimulation of the swallowing muscles using implanted microstimulators called BIONs. The&#xD;
      mechanism of the electrical stimulation is thought to be the same as that for other&#xD;
      rehabilitative approaches to muscle, i.e.,to help maintain strength and mobility of these&#xD;
      muscles during the post-operative treatment period when the muscles are not being used and&#xD;
      are particularly vulnerable to scarring and atrophy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different paradigms of stimulation will be employed in order to compare and gain insight&#xD;
      into the mechanisms involved in the remediation. This study also presents the opportunity to&#xD;
      examine directly the changes in muscle produced by stimulation. Thus, a secondary research&#xD;
      goal of the study that takes advantage of the opportunity presented by this intervention is&#xD;
      to gain insight into the cellular changes that are thought to underlie the effects of&#xD;
      radiation and subsequent electrical stimulation. By implanting these devices at the time of&#xD;
      the neck surgeries, it is possible to target the nerves that supply specific muscles and thus&#xD;
      ensure the excitation of specific muscles using current strengths much lower than those&#xD;
      required with transcutaneous stimulation.&#xD;

&#xD;
          6. Subject is willing and capable of giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is willing and capable of traveling to testing center at the necessary points&#xD;
             in the schedule of testing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject is pregnant, nursing, or planning to become pregnant in the next 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject has an electronic implant (e.g. cardiac pacemaker, etc.).&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject has large metallic implant (e.g. skull plates) in the head or neck region&#xD;
             (small metal implants, such as bone screws, metal sutures or dental parts are&#xD;
             acceptable).&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject has had previous surgery or disease of the upper esophageal tract or vocal&#xD;
             structures that have changed the normal anatomical relationships of the epiglottal&#xD;
             region, making swallowing abnormal, or have damaged the nerves of the target muscles&#xD;
             that control swallowing, making it difficult to stimulate the swallowing muscles&#xD;
             effectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject has an active immunosuppressive disorder such as AIDS that may result in&#xD;
             muscle wasting, or has a neurological injury or disease that affects the function of&#xD;
             the nerves or neuromuscular endplates in the throat, such as myasthenia gravis or&#xD;
             multiple sclerosis. The subject has a significant concurrent or recently diagnosed&#xD;
             (less than 3 months) medical condition that, in the opinion of the medical&#xD;
             investigator, could affect the ability of the patient to tolerate or complete the&#xD;
             study. Such conditions might include a second malignancy, heart disease or stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has a major psychological disorder, such as poorly controlled schizophrenia or&#xD;
             paranoia, that may affect the clinical interactions with the subject or result in poor&#xD;
             compliance with the therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject has a significant respiratory problem such as asthma or chronic obstructive&#xD;
             lung disease requiring regular use of inhaled or systemic corticosteroids. Subject has&#xD;
             a tracheostomy or has had previous surgery on the trachea that has damaged the&#xD;
             swallowing muscles or made inhalation of swallowed food more likely.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Subject is currently enrolled in another investigational study.&#xD;
