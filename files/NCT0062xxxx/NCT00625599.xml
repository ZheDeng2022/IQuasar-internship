  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As the population's life expectancy increases, fractures among the elderly in El Salvador are&#xD;
      also increasing. There is currently limited data specific to the incidence and cause of&#xD;
      fractures in the elderly within developing countries, such as El Salvador. The problem of&#xD;
      inadequate knowledge pertaining to bone health and osteoporosis among the elderly is&#xD;
      contributing to this aging population's health issues. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      investigate the incidence, prevalence, and risk factors effecting elderly patients admitted&#xD;
      for fractures at the Hospital Zacamil in San Salvador, El Salvador. The study will also&#xD;
      assess the current knowledge in two distinct populations on bone health and osteoporosis. The&#xD;
      first population will be the patients over the age of 45 that present to Hospital Zacamil&#xD;
      with acute fractures and are consulted by the department of orthopedics. The second&#xD;
      population will consist of students at the Evangelical University over the age of 18 in&#xD;
      non-medial track studies. All individuals will have to accept the invitation to participate&#xD;
      in the study. In addition, educational materials will be developed on the prevention of&#xD;
      fractures for medical professionals and for the elderly in El Salvador. The study objectives&#xD;
      will determine incidence and prevalence of elderly fractures of patients over the age of 45&#xD;
      at Hospital Zacamil. Secondly, the study will look at demographic information, prevalent&#xD;
      causes of fractures, treatment of the fractures, morbidity and mortality, and any&#xD;
      complications that may arise in the fracture patients prior to their discharge from the&#xD;
      hospital. Thirdly, the study will seek out the current level of knowledge on bone health,&#xD;
      osteoporosis, and fracture prevention in the young, educated Salvadorians and patients over&#xD;
      the age of 45 at Hospital Zacamil. Fourthly, the study will address the benefits of the&#xD;
      information gained by use of educational materials with the patients and doctors of El&#xD;
      Salvador.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis One:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fractures of the elderly at Hospital Zacamil are significantly associated with occurring at&#xD;
      the hip, wrist, and vertebra in comparison to other fracture locations.&#xD;

        There will be two populations for this study. Hospital patients, females and males, over&#xD;
        the age of 45 that are admitted to the department of orthopedics at the Hospital Zacamil in&#xD;
        San Salvador, El Salvador from January 2008 to April 2008 will represent one of the&#xD;
        populations. All patients over the age of 45 presenting to the hospital due to an acute&#xD;
        fracture will be invited to join the study. The individual's care will not be changed&#xD;
        negatively or positively based on whether or not the individual decides to participate in&#xD;
        this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The second population group will be the university students, females and males, over the&#xD;
        age of 18 participating in non-medical studies at the Evangelical University in February&#xD;
        2009. No student will be negatively affected by not participating in this study. There will&#xD;
        be no positive or negative influence on the student's grade or course assessment from&#xD;
        participating or choosing not to participate in this study.&#xD;
