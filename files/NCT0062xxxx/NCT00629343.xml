  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine safety and toxicity for the combination of&#xD;
      Temozolomide and Azacitidine in the treatment of Advanced Soft Tissue Sarcoma or Malignant&#xD;
      Mesothelioma. This is a single-center, open-label, single-arm Phase I dose-escalation trial.&#xD;
      Patients will be evaluated with complete history and physical as well as laboratory studies&#xD;
      (complete blood count, metabolic panel, liver function tests), biopsy, and imaging of all&#xD;
      sites of measurable disease. This study will be conducted over the course of 3 years.&#xD;

      The primary objective of the study is to determine the clinical and laboratory toxicities as&#xD;
      well as acceptability/tolerance of this dose schedule of combined drug treatment with&#xD;
      temozolomide and azacitidine.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include determination of biochemical response to azacitidine as defined&#xD;
      as change in methylation status. We will specifically be looking at changes in genome wide&#xD;
      methylation patterns as determined by two high-throughput platforms:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A single nucleotide polymorphism chip-based method (MSNP) for genome wide epigenetic&#xD;
           profiling&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. CpG island promoter arrays will be performed to focus on promoter methylation status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will also monitor clinical response, time to progression and overall survival.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed soft tissue sarcoma or mesothelioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ineligible for other high priority national or institutional study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Non-pregnant, non-lactating.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Recurrent or progressive disease defined as an increase in size of any existing tumor&#xD;
             mass, or the development of new tumor mass or masses, which is not amenable to&#xD;
             definitive surgical therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Measurable disease defined as lesions that can be measured in at least one dimension&#xD;
             by physical examination or by means of medical imaging techniques. Ascites and pleural&#xD;
             effusions will not be considered measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior chemotherapy is allowed with the exception of prior treatment with Temozolomide&#xD;
             or Azacitidine. Patients must have received prior 1st line therapy. There is no upper&#xD;
             limit to the number of prior therapies received. Prior treatment with an alkylating&#xD;
             agent is acceptable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior radiation therapy is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  At least 4 weeks since prior chemotherapy or at least 6 weeks since prior radiation&#xD;
             therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may have had another cancer but there must be convincing clinical evidence&#xD;
             that the sarcoma is the disease requiring therapeutic intervention. (i.e. Several&#xD;
             sarcoma patients have had had a prior cancer [Hodgkin's disease or breast cancer]&#xD;
             treated years previously and then developed a clinically active sarcoma.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical parameters: Life expectancy &gt; 3 months, Age &gt; 18 years, Performance Karnofsky&#xD;
             performance status of greater than or equal to 60%.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Required initial laboratory data:&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known or suspected hypersensitivity to azacitidine or mannitol&#xD;
