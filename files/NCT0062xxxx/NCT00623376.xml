      Objectives: To determine whether nabilone, a synthetic cannabinoid, alleviates spasticity in&#xD;
      people with spinal cord injury (SCI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Twelve subjects were enrolled in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover&#xD;
      study. They received either nabilone or placebo during the first four-week period (0.5mg OD&#xD;
      with option to increase to 0.5mg BID), then outcome measures were assessed. After a two-week&#xD;
      washout, subjects were crossed-over to the opposite arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome was the Ashworth scale for spasticity in the most involved muscle group,&#xD;
      chosen by the subject and clinician. The secondary outcomes included Spasm Frequency Scale,&#xD;
      Visual Analog Scale, Wartenberg Pendulum Test, sum of the Ashworth Scale in eight muscle&#xD;
      groups of each side of the body, and the Clinician's and Subject's Global Impression of&#xD;
      Change .&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with spinal cord injury were eligible for the study if they are 18-65 years&#xD;
             old, have C5 (ASIA A-D) and below and the injury occurred greater than 1 year&#xD;
             previously. They had to have stable neurological level of injury with moderate&#xD;
             spasticity (Ashworth &gt;/= 3) and no cognitive impairments. The spasticity medications&#xD;
             needed to be unchanged for at least 30 days before inclusion, and no botulinum toxin&#xD;
             injections for &gt; 4 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        They were excluded if they had:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Heart disease as cannabinoids can reduce heart rate and blood pressure&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of psychotic disorders, schizophrenia or any active psychological disorder&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previously documented sensitivity to marijuana or other cannabinoid agents&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Severe liver dysfunction&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Cognitive impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major illness in another body area&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If they were pregnant or nursing mother&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Had history of drug dependency&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Used smoked cannabis &lt; 30 days before the onset of the study or were unwilling not to&#xD;
             smoke during the study; OR&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If they fixed tendon contractures&#xD;
