      This study seeks to validate clinically evoked or obtained objective pain signs with the&#xD;
      patient's corresponding quantified subjective pain symptoms. This will allow for validation&#xD;
      of objective clinical pain signs to then be used to begin to classify patients with pain&#xD;
      based on symptoms and signs. This then can be used as a basis for further study of&#xD;
      neuropathic pain mechanisms in human patients.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <study_pop>
      <textblock>
        Patients with neuropathic pain from the following diagnosis groups: post-herperic&#xD;
        neuralgia, painful diabetic neuropathy, and spinal cord injury will be included in the&#xD;
        study if their pain is of at least 6 months duration.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects must be 18 years of age and older, and able to provide informed consent and&#xD;
             communicate in English. Pain rating inclusion criteria will be pain greater than 3 up&#xD;
             to 9, as rated on the 0-10 pain scale, where 10 is the worst pain imaginable. This&#xD;
             rating is based on the numeric pain rating scale (NPRS).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PHN - Subjects with PHN will have a history of pain of at least 6 months duration in&#xD;
             the area that was the site of a zoster rash resulting in nerve injury. In most cases,&#xD;
             subjects experience a number of sensory abnormalities in the affected area, ranging&#xD;
             from pain to numbness, and various degrees of hypersensitivity. Subjects with PHN must&#xD;
             otherwise be in stable health. Pain rating inclusion criteria for PHN subjects will be&#xD;
             pain greater than 3 up to 9, as rated on the 0-10 pain scale, where 10 is the worst&#xD;
             pain imaginable.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  PDN - Subjects with diabetes mellitus and neuropathy who have a history of pain,&#xD;
             predominantly in the lower extremities, of at least 6 months duration qualify for the&#xD;
             diagnosis of PDN for purposes of this study. In most cases PDN is due to small fiber&#xD;
             neuropathy, so physical examination should yield sensory abnormalities, such as pain,&#xD;
             paresthesiae and numbness. Motor function and stretch reflex abnormalities are common&#xD;
             but not necessary for inclusion. PDN patients in whom large fiber functions are&#xD;
             affected, experience weakness and decreased or absent stretch reflexes, respectively,&#xD;
             and are eligible for this study. Other causes of neuropathy will be excluded. PDN&#xD;
             patients with pain rating of greater than 3 up to 9 on 0-10 scale will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  SCI pain - Subjects with SCI and pain of at least 6 months duration will be invited to&#xD;
             participate. In most cases, these subjects' sensory, motor and stretch reflex&#xD;
             abnormalities are consistent with SCI. Sensory findings range form complete loss of&#xD;
             sensation to preservation of all sensory modalities. Motor findings range from mild&#xD;
             weakness to complete paralysis. Stretch reflexes are most frequently increased though&#xD;
             in a few patients they can be absent. Based on the constellation of sensory and motor&#xD;
             findings in particular patients, diagnosis of complete versus incomplete SCI is made.&#xD;
             In this study we will study patients with incomplete SCI who have pain at level of&#xD;
             injury or below level of injury, or both. Subjects with SCI who have pain rating of&#xD;
             greater than 3 up to 9 on 0-10 scale will be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with pain due to disorders other than PDN, PTN, or SCI, as well as unknown&#xD;
             causes, will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with neuropathies from causes such as vasculitis, demyelinating&#xD;
             polyneuropathies, HIV-associated neuropathy, and paraneoplastic and post-infectious&#xD;
             neuropathies will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with chemotherapy-induced neuropathy will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who suffer from pain due to different pain mechanisms will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other pain (at a different site) that is more severe than their PDN or&#xD;
             PTN pain will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a history of recent or ongoing alcohol or other drug addiction disorders&#xD;
             (as self-reported or previously documented in the medical record) will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are determined to have cognitive and reading impairments which would&#xD;
             preclude them from completing questionnaires will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients whose chronic medical and psychiatric comorbidities are not under optimal&#xD;
             control, or who are currently experiencing an acute exacerbation of a medical or&#xD;
             psychiatric comorbidity, will be excluded.&#xD;
