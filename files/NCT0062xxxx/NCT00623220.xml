  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the proposed study is to show that inhaled equimolar mixture of&#xD;
      oxygen and nitrous oxide (EMONO) will reduce pain associated with retinal exam in the preterm&#xD;
      infant, as compared to the current standard treatment (oral sucrose and topical anaesthesia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators also aim to show that EMONO can be used safely in preterm neonates&#xD;
      undergoing retinal exam, and will not result in any increase in apnea, bradycardia, or&#xD;
      desaturation in the 24 hours following the exam. Finally, the investigators aim to show that&#xD;
      EMONO will keep the infant calm, and make retinal examination easier and less traumatic.&#xD;

      Methods&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Eligible patients will be healthy preterm infants born at 30 0/7 or less than weeks of&#xD;
           gestation, or weigh less than 1500 grams at birth, requiring retinopathy of prematurity&#xD;
           (ROP) screening examination as indicated by AAP guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be recruited at the Royal Victoria Hospital Neonatal Intensive Care Unit.&#xD;
      Subjects will be enrolled after written informed consent has been obtained from a parent or&#xD;
      legal guardian. Although a single patient may require multiple retinal exams, each infant&#xD;
      will only be studied once under this protocol. Total number of eligible patients, as well as&#xD;
      consent refusals will be recorded during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted in two phases. A pilot phase, comprising 9 infants, will be&#xD;
      performed first. The purpose of the pilot study is to establish the safety of EMONO for this&#xD;
      indication, evaluate the technical feasibility of administering EMONO in the NICU setting,&#xD;
      and determining the optimal nasal interface for inhalation. All subjects during the pilot&#xD;
      phase will receive EMONO.&#xD;
&#xD;
      40 babies will be recruited for the second phase of the study, and will be randomized to&#xD;
      either the therapeutic group (EMONO), or the placebo group (50% oxygen/50% nitrogen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. Gas administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All 9 patients in the pilot phase, and patients randomized to the intervention group will&#xD;
      receive EMONO. The mixture will be obtained by using hospital compressed oxygen and a tank of&#xD;
      N2O (Praxair Canada Inc, Mississauga, ON). N2O and oxygen will be mixed via a Bird low flow&#xD;
      nitrous oxide blender (Summit Technologies, Burlington, ON) to obtain a mixture of 50% O2 and&#xD;
      50% N2O. Subjects in the control group will receive a mixture of 50% O2 and 50% N2. This will&#xD;
      be produced by mixing hospital air and oxygen through a blender.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the study, a respiratory therapy technician will open both gas valves and one of them&#xD;
      will be randomly connected to the patient's inhalation device. The research team at the&#xD;
      bedside will not be able to see which gas output the patient is connected too.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study or control gas will be administered by one of three devices during the pilot phase of&#xD;
      the study: nasal cannula (Airlife Infant Cushion Nasal Cannula, Cardinal Health, McGraw Park,&#xD;
      IL), a clear plastic infant resuscitation mask, or a clear plastic non-rebreather mask&#xD;
      (Medium concentration infant oxygen mask, Rusch Medical, Duluth, GA). Three patients will be&#xD;
      studied with each device, and different gas flows will be used. The optimal inhalation&#xD;
      device, duration of inhalation, and gas flow will be thus determined and used for the 40&#xD;
      patients in the 2nd phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The gas administered to each subject will be determined randomly. Sealed opaque envelopes&#xD;
      will be prepared in advance, each containing one infant's assignment. The envelope will be&#xD;
      opened by the respiratory therapy technician who sets up the inhalation circuit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Study protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All studies will be conducted in the Royal Victoria Hospital NICU. Complete neonatal&#xD;
      resuscitation equipment, meeting AAP Neonatal Resuscitation Program standards, will be&#xD;
      available on hand. The following personnel will be present for all studies: a neonatologist&#xD;
      (usually one of the co-investigators), a licensed respiratory therapist in charge of gas&#xD;
      administration, two registered nurses experienced in the care of neonates (one nurse&#xD;
      responsible for restraining the infant and the other for monitoring the baby's vital signs),&#xD;
      an ophthalmologist experienced in ROP screening who will conduct the retinal exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies will be performed in the morning after routine nursing care of the babies. Infants&#xD;
      will be pre-treated 30 minutes before with phenylephrine 2.5% 1 drop in each eye, and&#xD;
      cyclopentolate 1.5% 1 drop in each as eye, as done routinely in our unit before eye exams.&#xD;
      Infants will be placed on cardio-respiratory monitoring using one of the monitors available&#xD;
      in our unit. All infants will be swaddled and held by a nurse, as is routinely done in our&#xD;
      unit. The inhalation device will be placed on the infant by the respiratory therapist,&#xD;
      allowing control or study gas administration. During the pilot phase ocular manipulations&#xD;
      will not be started until adequate analgesia is obtained, or a maximum of 15 minutes have&#xD;
      passed. This will allow us to determine the duration of inhalation necessary for effective&#xD;
      analgesia, and this duration will then be used for the randomized phase of the trial. All&#xD;
      infants in both groups can receive oral sucrose for pain relief as per unit protocol. A&#xD;
      pharmacy prepared solution of sucrose 24% will be used. Sucrose will be administered orally&#xD;
      in pre-prepared 1mL syringes, and given in 0.1 mL aliquots, up to a maximum of 0.3 mL.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proparacaine HCl 0.5% eye drops will be instilled and retinal examination will be performed&#xD;
      by the ophthalmologist, while the infant is held by the bedside nurse. Both nurses present&#xD;
      will separately score the infant's pain response, before the beginning of examination, during&#xD;
      the examination, and 2 hours after. Only the first eye examined will be scored, since both&#xD;
      eyes are examined in rapid succession and the PIPP score will not have time to decrease in&#xD;
      between both eyes. After completing the exam, the infant will be returned to standard nursing&#xD;
      care. All infants will be monitored continuously by pulse oximetry 24 hours before and after&#xD;
      the exam. Additionally, infants in the pilot study phase will undergo a full 24 hour sleep&#xD;
      study after the exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Measurements:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Primary outcome: The primary objective is to show decrease of pain response in the&#xD;
      treatment group as measured by the PIPP (Premature Infant Pain Profile) score. The PIPP score&#xD;
      is a multidimensional composite pain score developed for evaluating acute procedural pain&#xD;
      preterm neonates. Its use has been validated in clinical settings, with high intra and&#xD;
      inter-rater reliability. It measures 7 different elements including physiological parameters,&#xD;
      facial expression, behaviour and gestational age. Each is evaluated on a scale of 0 to 3,&#xD;
      yielding a combined score ranging from 0 to 21. In the initial validations studies, baseline&#xD;
      mean scores in infants were 4.9 ± 1.0, non painful events yielded mean scores of 9.0 ± 0.8,&#xD;
      while painful heelsticks were measured at 11.0 ± 1.3. All nurses in our unit are fully&#xD;
      trained in the use of the PIPP score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Secondary outcomes: After each exam, the ophthalmologist will evaluate the ease of&#xD;
      performing the procedure, as well as the degree of agitation in the infant using a simple&#xD;
      ordinal scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Heart and respiratory rate will be monitored using one of our NICU integrated monitors:&#xD;
      Draeger Infinity Gamma XL (Draeger Medical Canada Inc, Richmond Hill, ON), or HP Agilent&#xD;
      V29C/HP 895 (Hewlett Packard Company, Palo Alto, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous pulse oximetry will be performed with a Masimo Radical pulse oximeter (Masimo&#xD;
      Corp., Irvine, CA), and data will be analyzed using ProFox oximetry software (Escondido, CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in the pilot study will undergo a full cardiorespirogram, with continuous measurement&#xD;
      of heart rate, respiratory impedance, thermistor nasal airflow, and pulse oximetry (Eden&#xD;
      Trace II and Eden Trace Analysis Software, Mallinckrodt Co, St-Louis, MO). Data will sampled&#xD;
      at 4 Hz and recorded on a personal computer. Apnea will be defined as absence of airflow for&#xD;
      15 seconds or more. Drops in oxygen saturation will be measured as total time spent below 88%&#xD;
      and number of episodes below 88%. It is the policy in our unit to maintain all oxygen&#xD;
      saturation levels between 88% and 92% for preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The following data will be collected and recorded for all study infants, using patient&#xD;
      charts, maternal charts, nursing records, and respiratory therapy data sheets: sex,&#xD;
      birthweight, gestational age at birth, current weight, relevant maternal history and&#xD;
      antenatal risk factors, previous respiratory care including modes and duration of ventilatory&#xD;
      support, frequency of apnea and bradycardia, major neonatal complications (hyaline membrane&#xD;
      disease, persistent ductus arteriosus, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis,&#xD;
      intra-ventricular hemorrhage), medications received including opiates and caffeine. The CRIB&#xD;
      II score (Clinical Risk Index for Babies) at admission will be computed for infants in the&#xD;
      study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patient data related to the study will be kept in a locked filing cabinet, in a locked&#xD;
      office at the Royal Victoria Hospital. Only the co-investigators will have access to this&#xD;
      data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Sample size calculation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the pilot study, a total number 9 patients was chosen, to allow three patients to be&#xD;
      studied with each different nasal inhalation device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the randomized trial portion, data on PIPP scores was reviewed for all eye exams&#xD;
      performed between September 2006 and February 2007 in our unit. A total of 16 eligible exams&#xD;
      with complete data were identified. Mean PIPP score was 13.4 ± 3.4. A 25% reduction would&#xD;
      bring the PIPP score down to 10, which is below the average for painful events as described&#xD;
      by Ballantyne et al, and is also a clinically reasonable and meaningful target. We calculate&#xD;
      that it would take approximately 20 patients in each group, control and placebo, to show a&#xD;
      reduction in PIPP score from 13.4 to 10 using a two sample t-test. A two-tailed alpha level&#xD;
      of 0.05 was used, with a power of 0.8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data for the Royal Victoria Hospital NICU show approximately 85 infants &lt; 32 0/7 weeks or &lt;&#xD;
      1500g are admitted per year. We would estimate enrollment in the study would take&#xD;
      approximately 1 year.&#xD;
&#xD;
      9. Statistics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous numerical data between control and intervention groups will be compared using the&#xD;
      two-sample t-test for normally distributed variables. The Wilcoxon rank sum test will be used&#xD;
      for data not distributed normally. Categorical data will be compared using the chi-squared&#xD;
      test.&#xD;
