      Originally test host's to understand the tracking healthily and immune change of the dengue&#xD;
      fever in Taiwan. Blood drawing 20 c.c for liver examination, kidney and other biochemical&#xD;
      function, analyze host immunity adjusts and controls the gene, and the reciprocation that may&#xD;
      be produced with the virus hepatitis, besides collected 10 c.c urine at the same time. Urine&#xD;
      check is in order to compare acute infect and infected over three month person, the change of&#xD;
      chemical composition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This plan expect to collect 150 healthy, 150 dengue fever infected and 150 dengue fever bleed&#xD;
      hot or dengue fever shock disease group's patient, goal to understand health state and&#xD;
      immunity of follow-up adjust and control the difference of the gene and the reciprocation may&#xD;
      produce to virus hepatitis of light disease and serious disease.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The dengue fever is an important tropical infectious disease in the south of Taiwan, cause&#xD;
      and threaten of public health at Kaohsiung and Ping-Dong all over the years, this will cause&#xD;
      patient's death, the default of clinical change of dengue fever, acute infect, infect&#xD;
      influence, host immunity adjust and control, and the reciprocation of virus hepatitis, will&#xD;
      be a very urgent in basic research.&#xD;

      Originally test host's to understand the tracking healthily and immune change of the dengue&#xD;

      This plan expect to collect 150 healthy, 150 dengue fever infected and 150 dengue fever bleed&#xD;

      immunity of follow-up adjust and control the difference of the gene and the reciprocation may&#xD;

&#xD;
      Urine check is in order to compare acute infect and infected over three month person, the&#xD;
      change of chemical composition. The result of study can help doctor to understand the factor&#xD;
      of immune regulation and control of the host and health change after the dengue fever is&#xD;
      infected with, possible reciprocation with virus hepatitis. Researchers have collect 100&#xD;
      dengue fever bleed hot or dengue fever shock syndrome groups of patient, it is estimated that&#xD;
      can collect and expect the case will be counted within two years.&#xD;
