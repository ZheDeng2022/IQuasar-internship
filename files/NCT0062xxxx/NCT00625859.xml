    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to look at concentrations of GSK189075, WELLBUTRIN SR&#xD;
      and active metabolic products in blood samples when doses of both drugs are taken by mouth.&#xD;
      Doses are either taken alone or together. The results will help to determine if doses of&#xD;
      GSK189075 and WELLBUTRIN SR can be safely taken together.&#xD;
