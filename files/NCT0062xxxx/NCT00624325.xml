  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For chronic hepatitis C patients unresponsive to previous (PEG-)IFN/RBV combination therapy&#xD;
      we propose continuous subcutaneous administration of high-dose IFN-a2b (Intron A®) for 48&#xD;
      weeks in combination with 15 mg/kg/day RBV (Rebetol®) and optimal management of side effects&#xD;
      in order to maintain the highest possible dosages of both IFN-a2b and RBV for 48 weeks. We&#xD;
      expect improved tolerability with continuous subcutaneous pump delivery of IFN-a2b compared&#xD;
      to thrice weekly or daily subcutaneous injection of IFN-a2b, and increased antiviral activity&#xD;
      and biologic potency due to sustained and higher levels of a fully potent interferon protein.&#xD;

          -  Hepatitis C genotype 1 unresponsive to (peg)interferon /ribavirin therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  In the past, peginterferon or conventional interferon plus ribavirin combination&#xD;
             therapy for at least 12 weeks and less than 2-log HCV RNA decrease at week 12, HCV RNA&#xD;

&#xD;

             high-dose IFN/ribavirin therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
