      Age Related Macular Degeneration (ARMD) is the most common cause of irreversible blindness in&#xD;
      people of age 50 or older in the western populations. ARMD has two forms, the wet and the dry&#xD;
      forms. The wet form is more serious and can lead to irreversible loss of vision. In the wet&#xD;
      form of ARMD, new blood vessels grow under the retina. These blood vessels leak blood and&#xD;
      fluid and cause the retina and the macula to swell. So the thickness of the macula increases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the key factors in the treatment of wet ARMD is early diagnosis and treatment to&#xD;
      prevent complete visual loss. In this research, we are going to use a technique, called the&#xD;
      Heidelberg retinal tomograph (HRT) to measure and compare the thickness of the macula in&#xD;
      healthy controls and in patients suspected of having ARMD. HRT is a non-invasive imaging&#xD;
      system that uses laser to measure the thickness of the macula. This allows us to come up with&#xD;
      a quite simple and easy-to-use technique that helps us to diagnose wet ARMD early and treat&#xD;
      it before visual acuity is completely lost.&#xD;

      Introduction: Age-related macular degeneration (ARMD) is a spectrum of related diseases that&#xD;
      affects the macula and it has been traditionally classified into early and late stages with&#xD;
      its dry (non-exudative) and wet (exudative) forms. Although the advanced form of AMD is less&#xD;
      common, the potential visual loss is more significant. The Beaver Dam Eye Study reported that&#xD;
      30% of individuals aged 75 and older have some form of AMD, whereas 7% of those aged 75 and&#xD;
      older have an advanced form. Recent studies estimate that 8 million Americans are considered&#xD;
      to be at risk for developing advanced ARMD in the next 5 years, whereas 1.75 million are&#xD;
      currently affected with the advanced form of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Wet AMD is characterized by proliferation of abnormal vessels in the choroid. These choroidal&#xD;
      neovascular membranes may proliferate into the subretinal space and retina and leak fluid and&#xD;
      blood. This fluid may accumulate in the macula area causing macular edema (ME), the final&#xD;
      common pathway for visual loss in many diseases. There are currently no treatments that can&#xD;
      reverse or repair the destruction and restore visual acuity. The critical time for any&#xD;
      intervention is early in the disease, when visual acuity has been minimally affected. Due to&#xD;
      the irreversible nature of the disease and a realistic risk of permanent vision loss, there&#xD;
      is an increased need to improve the accuracy of identifying the presence and extent of&#xD;
      MEvwith a prompt referral to a retina specialist following diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ME has traditionally been assessed clinically using a combination of slit lamp biomicroscopy&#xD;
      and fluorescein angiography. New imaging techniques such as optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT), the retinal thickness analyser (RTA), and the Heidelberg retinal tomograph (HRT)&#xD;
      confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope facilitate qualitative assessments of the degree of&#xD;
      ME. Although OCT has a high sensitivity and specificity for the detection of ME within 500&#xD;
      microns of the fovea, this resolution decreases outside this area. RTA has shown lower&#xD;
      sensitivity (57%) for the detection of ME. 4 The Heidelberg Retinal Tomograph II (HRT II,&#xD;
      Heidelberg Engineering) is a non-invasive, confocal scanning laser imaging system that uses a&#xD;
      red (670 nm) diode laser to perform a series of optical sections of the macula area covering&#xD;
      a 15°x15° field of view, corresponding to approximately 4.5 x 4.5 mm on the retina. The&#xD;
      reflected laser light intensity is processed assisting with a quantitative diagnosis of ME.&#xD;
      If ME is present, the amount of scatter inside the swollen retina increases, reducing retinal&#xD;
      reflectance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A few studies have evaluated the HRT for detecting ME. Tong and co-workers have proposed a&#xD;
      scoring system for macular image assessment using HRT in patients with diabetic maculopathy.&#xD;
      Guan and co-workers found the HRT to have a sensitivity and specificity of 92% and 68% for&#xD;
      detecting ME in the diabetic population when using clinical assessment as the gold standard.&#xD;
      To the best of our knowledge, no studies have yet validate the used HRT for the detection of&#xD;
      ME as an early sign of exudative disease in ARMD patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Purpose: The purpose of the study is to assessed the sensitivity, specificity, and&#xD;
      repeatability, of HRT for the presence of ME in exudative ARMD Design: Prospective,&#xD;
      observational study. Objectives: 1) Assessment of healthy volunteers to obtain baseline&#xD;
      normal measurements of macular thickening. 2) Measurements in ARMD patient's referred to a&#xD;
      retinal specialist clinic with the diagnosis of exudative form of ARMD Patients, Material,&#xD;
      and Methods: 1) normal controls (N=20): baseline measurements centered at the fovea will be&#xD;
      taken. Three consecutive measurements will be performed (within-session repeatability). 2)&#xD;
      Patients: New patients referred by general ophthalmologists to the retina specialist for&#xD;
      possible diagnosis of ARMD, exudative formed, will be included in the study. All patients&#xD;
      will undergo a full ophthalmologic exam by the same retinal specialist who will determine the&#xD;
      clinical presence of ME (gold standard) using fundus contact lens examination. In some cases,&#xD;
      fluorescein angiograms will be use as an ancillary test. All patients will then be evaluated&#xD;
      using HRT for the presence of ME using the macula edema module. The technician performing the&#xD;
      test will be mask to the patients' clinical diagnosis. Three consecutive measurements will be&#xD;
      performed in 4 quadrants (500-1000-1500 microns/ 4 quadrants) (color map and reflectivity) 3)&#xD;
      Comparison will be made between the clinical diagnosis of ME (gold standard) and results&#xD;
      obtained by the HRT. Features compared: 1) presence/absence of ME 2) spacial agreement&#xD;
      between areas of elevated retina encountered by HRT Vs clinical examination.&#xD;
