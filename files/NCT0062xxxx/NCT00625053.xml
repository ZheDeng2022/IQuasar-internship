      Background: Midline incisional hernia is reported from 0,5 to 11% after abdominal operations.&#xD;
      Primary repair without mesh reinforcement is almost abandoned because of high recurrence&#xD;
      rates (24 to 46%). Use of prosthetic mesh in incisional hernia repair lowered the recurrence&#xD;
      rates under 10%. Recurrence rate alone is not the main quality criterion for incisional&#xD;
      hernia repair anymore. Large series and meta-analyses confirmed the value of laparoscopic&#xD;
      repair as at least equal if not better compared with open repair. Discomfort, pain,&#xD;
      diminished quality of life and body image alteration influences functional well being. No&#xD;
      baseline information exists in any of these fields treating pre- or post-operative phases in&#xD;
      patients with incisional hernia. Respiratory functions and medico-economic evaluation are&#xD;
      other rarely investigated fields that we consider in our trial. The objective of this study&#xD;
      is to analyse the functional outcome status of patients after laparoscopic incisional hernia&#xD;
      repair compared to open repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled non-blinded clinical trial is designed to compare&#xD;
      laparoscopic incisional hernia mesh repair with open repair on post operative pain, health&#xD;
      related quality of life outcomes, body image and cosmetic measurements, respiratory&#xD;
      functions, recurrence rates, and cost. Volunteers will be recruited in Geneva University&#xD;
      Hospital, department of surgery, visceral surgery unit. Eligibility criteria is male patient&#xD;
      aged over 18 years, with reducible incisional hernia who are candidates for elective surgery&#xD;
      and medically fit for general anesthesia.30 patients will be enrolled for each group.&#xD;
      Follow-up will take place at 10th, 30th days as well as 3 12 and 24 post operative months by&#xD;
      questionnaires and by clinical exam by independent expert. An overall cost-analysis will be&#xD;
      realized. Patient enrollment in the study will start in April 2008 and estimated to end in&#xD;
      september 2009.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Midline incisional hernia is reported from 0,5 to 11% after abdominal operations. Discomfort,&#xD;
      pain, body image alteration and diminished quality of life influences functional well being.&#xD;
      Alteration in pulmonary function, risk of visceral incarceration or cutaneous complications&#xD;
      are potential medical complications. Primary repair without mesh reinforcement is almost&#xD;
      abandoned because of high recurrence rates (24 to 46%). Recurrence rate with prosthetic&#xD;
      repair in published series vary from 4% to 29%. Different techniques for mesh placement and&#xD;
      variety of mesh and fixation material explains this wide range of recurrence rate&#xD;
      nevertheless, large series with standardized techniques report less than 4% of recurrence&#xD;
      rates.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Laparoscopic repair for incisional hernia is first published in 1993. Following reported&#xD;
      large personal series in recent years and evolution of adapted materiel, this technique&#xD;
      gained popularity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main difference between open and laparoscopic techniques is the reconstruction of the&#xD;
      abdominal wall. In all open techniques, abdominal wall is reconstructed (hernia edges brought&#xD;
      together) with reinforcement of the abdominal wall by a mesh inserted onlay, sublay or inlay.&#xD;
      In laparoscopic repair, the fascial defect is left in-situ but reinforced with a mesh,&#xD;
      overlapping largely the edges of hernia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Advocated advantages of laparoscopy are: less abdominal wall dissection (less surgical&#xD;
      complications), tension-free mesh repair (no suturing), less postoperative pain, less&#xD;
      respiratory complications, shorter hospital stay, faster return to professional activity.&#xD;
      Disadvantages attributed to laparoscopic repair are the steep learning curve, high material&#xD;
      cost, longer operation times and rare but serious complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Large series and meta analyses confirmed the value of laparoscopic repair as at least equal&#xD;
      if not better compared with open repair. Most of the trials are focused on recurrence,&#xD;
      complication rate, hospital stay and sick leave. Only recently, quality of life and pain&#xD;
      started to be evaluated. No valuable data exists on chronic pain or persistent neuralgia,&#xD;
      body image, cosmesis or neuroticism neither after open nor the laparoscopic repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chronic pain or persistent neuralgia has been recognized as a complication after inguinal&#xD;
      hernia repair but was reported in the 1980s as a rare and infrequent condition. Studies from&#xD;
      the mid 1990s have reported a higher frequency, with up to 50% of patients reporting pain&#xD;
      after hernia repair more than 1 year after surgery. Chronic pain after hernia repair can be&#xD;
      disabling, with considerable impact on quality of life. The natural history of postoperative&#xD;
      pain, including its prevalence, etiology, duration, associated disability and it's social and&#xD;
      economical impact remain undefined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We know from our experience in inguinal hernia that chronic pain needs to be investigated&#xD;
      scrupulously to be identified. 20 to 27% chronic pain is associated to open repair in series&#xD;
      without specific questionnaires. Overall frequency of chronic pain is higher in studies with&#xD;
      specific measurements, where pain is the primary outcome of interest. Preoperative&#xD;
      psychological state of patient (depression, dependencies, drug consumption etc.) or history&#xD;
      of chronic pain with previous surgery or accident may be a predicting factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of &quot;chronic pain&quot; by the International Association of the Study of Pain is&#xD;
      &quot;pain lasting for 3 months or more&quot;. There is no a consensus on neither in the definition,&#xD;
      nor the severity grades of CSPOP in the literature. In our study chronic pain is defined as a&#xD;
      minimal score &gt; 4 using the quadruple visual analogue scale (VASQ) 3 months after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Somatic, and neuropathic chronic pain syndromes are described. Neuropathic pain usually&#xD;
      develops in the sensory distribution of an injured nerve. Chronic residual neuralgia occurs&#xD;
      as a result of surgical handing of sensory nerves. The nerve trauma can be due to partial or&#xD;
      complete division, stretching, contusion, crushing, electrical damage, or sutures&#xD;
      compression. Secondary nerve damage can occur due to irritation or compression by an adjacent&#xD;
      inflammatory process such as granuloma. Neuropathic pain described as pulling, tugging,&#xD;
      tearing, throbbing, stabbing, shooting, numbing, and dull. The onset of neuropathic pain is&#xD;
      often delayed, occurring after a latent period of days to weeks. Pain is often aggravated by&#xD;
      ambulation and sexual intercourse. Once chronic pain is installed, it does not change without&#xD;
      a radical treatment. Preoperative psychological state of patient (Depression, dependencies,&#xD;
      drug consumption etc.) or history of chronic pain with previous surgery or accident may be a&#xD;
      predicting factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The definition of ''Body image'' is given as person's perception of, satisfaction with, and&#xD;
      attitudes toward his or her body in general and to particular areas of the body. Little is&#xD;
      known about the subjective feelings and cosmetic consequences of scarring in patients who&#xD;
      undergo either conventional or laparoscopic abdominal surgery. Few data has been reported&#xD;
      about body image in patients with cancer, particular after mutilating operations such as&#xD;
      mastectomy. Three papers on ileocolectomy, proctectomy and live donor nephrectomy are&#xD;
      published by Dutch groups, comparing laparoscopy and laparotomy. Body image in presence of an&#xD;
      incisional hernia is certainly degraded before the surgery, unfortunately no baseline data&#xD;
      exists to date. Therefore, an hypothetic, relative, significant improvement in body image by&#xD;
      laparoscopic treatment compared to open repair needs to be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The standard open technique in our institution has two declinations, the first technique is&#xD;
      retromuscular sublay and the second, open onlay mesh repair. In both techniques the fascial&#xD;
      defect is closed by suture repair with mesh reinforcement. Superiority of one of these&#xD;
      techniques compared to another is not proved, properly done, both achieve low recurrence&#xD;
      rates. Laparoscopic technique needs to meet widely accepted good-practice principles:&#xD;
      complete adhesiolysis between abdominal wall and viscera, use of specific bilayer mesh (non&#xD;
      adherent on the visceral surface), coverage of totality of the previous scar length with at&#xD;
      least 5cm overlap, adequate fixation.&#xD;
