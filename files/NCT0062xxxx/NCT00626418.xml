    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and tolerability of single doses of&#xD;
      aplindore compared to placebo in RLS. Patients will be required to spend 5-8 nights in a&#xD;
      sleep laboratory. This includes 1 adaptation night, 1 placebo night, and 3-6 drug treatment&#xD;
      nights. Ascending doses of active drug will be administered on study nights 3 through 5 to&#xD;
      determine the maximum well tolerated efficacious dose (defined as a decrease in Periodic Limb&#xD;
      Movement Index (PLMI) of at least 50% from placebo baseline). If an efficacious dose cannot&#xD;
      be identified the Investigator in consultation with the sponsor may decide to examine higher&#xD;
      doses in up to 3 additional PSG nights in an attempt to identify a tolerable efficacious&#xD;
      dose. This study will utilize up to 24 evaluable patients, each meeting International&#xD;
      Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-2) diagnostic criteria for primary RLS who are not&#xD;
      currently taking any RLS medication including DAs ( and L-dopa) or who are able to&#xD;
      discontinue their RLS medication at least 5 half-lives prior to the adaptation night.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurosensorimotor disorder of uncertain etiology that&#xD;
      commonly disturbs sleep. The main feature of the disorder is paresthesia felt deep in the&#xD;
      limbs that troubles the individual when he or she is at rest. The paresthesias of RLS&#xD;
      commonly increase during the evening or the early part of the night. Patients are commonly&#xD;
      less bothered by symptoms in the morning, unless they are severely affected. The repetitive&#xD;
      movements that lead to arousal may also cause a subset of patients to become quite sleepy&#xD;
      during the daytime. This sleepiness is usually not as severe as that found in patients with&#xD;
      sleep apnea or narcolepsy but can be quite disruptive to quality of life and daytime&#xD;
      functioning. Recent surveys indicate that RLS occurs in 10% to 15% of the North American&#xD;
      population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common associated feature of RLS is Periodic Limb Movements during Sleep (PLMS). These are&#xD;
      repetitive movements that typically occur as flexions of the foot, knee, and hip at intervals&#xD;
      of 5 to 90 seconds. Most commonly, the interval is 20 to 40 seconds. The movements are&#xD;
      present during non-rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep and are less common during REM sleep.&#xD;
      Population-based studies have found that RLS is associated with an increased risk for&#xD;
      hypertension and coronary artery disease. Periodic leg movements -related repetitive&#xD;
      nocturnal blood pressure fluctuations may contribute to this increased risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease especially in the elderly19. There is a possibility that dopamine agonist (DA)&#xD;
      reduction of PLMS may mitigate the risk of the cardiovascular complications of RLS. The&#xD;
      potential role of aplindore in reducing PLMS and nocturnal blood pressure fluctuations will&#xD;
      be evaluated in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dopaminergic agents have become the most common medications used in the treatment of RLS and&#xD;
      PLMS. Aplindore is an orally available, small molecule partial agonist of the D2 dopamine&#xD;
      receptor. Preclinical in vitro and in vivo results have demonstrated the functional agonist&#xD;
      selectivity of aplindore for supersensitive D2 receptors in the striatum, but not&#xD;
      extra-striatal D2 receptors. Stimulation of D2 receptors in areas deficient in dopamine is&#xD;
      attributed to aplindore's low intrinsic activity and high affinity for these receptors.&#xD;
      Aplindore has been studied in preclinical toxicology studies in rats for up to 6 months and&#xD;
      in monkeys for up to 1 year with safety margins in excess of 100-fold relative to projected&#xD;
      human efficacious doses. The primary objective of this study is to assess the efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability of single doses of aplindore compared to placebo in RLS. The secondary&#xD;
      objectives are to generate safety data with aplindore to support outpatient trials in RLS. b)&#xD;
      To generate pilot data on the effects of aplindore on changes in blood pressure and heart&#xD;
      rate associated with PLMS in patients with RLS. c) To understand the concentration-effect&#xD;
      relationships of aplindore on RLS symptoms.&#xD;
