  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase I trial is studying the side effects and best dose of aflibercept in treating&#xD;
      young patients with relapsed or refractory solid tumors. Aflibercept may stop the growth of&#xD;
      tumor cells by blocking blood flow to the tumor.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To estimate the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) or recommended phase II dose (RPTD) of&#xD;
      aflibercept administered intravenously every 14 days in children with relapsed or refractory&#xD;
      solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To estimate the MTD or RPTD of aflibercept administered intravenously every 21 days in&#xD;
      these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. To define and describe the toxicities of intravenous aflibercept administered on a&#xD;
      14-day and 21-day schedule, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To characterize the pharmacokinetics of intravenous aflibercept in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To define, preliminarily, the antitumor activity of intravenous aflibercept within the&#xD;
      confines of a phase I study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 1: Patients receive aflibercept IV over 1 hour on day 1. Treatment repeats every 14 days&#xD;
      for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Cohorts of 3-6&#xD;
      patients receive aflibercept until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PART 2: Patients receive aflibercept as in part 1 at 150% of the MTD determined in part 1.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 21 days for 2 years in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Blood samples are collected prior to treatment on day 1 of courses 1, 2, and 5 or 6 for&#xD;
      pharmacokinetic studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed for at least 30 days.&#xD;
