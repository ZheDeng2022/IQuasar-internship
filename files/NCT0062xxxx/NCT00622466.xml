      RATIONALE: Sorafenib may stop the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes&#xD;
      needed for cell growth and by blocking blood flow to the tumor. Drugs used in chemotherapy,&#xD;
      such as paclitaxel, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by&#xD;
      killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. Giving sorafenib together with&#xD;
      paclitaxel may kill more tumor cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying the side effects of giving sorafenib together with&#xD;
      paclitaxel and to how well it works in treating patients with metastatic breast cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the efficacy of sorafenib tosylate and paclitaxel by measuring tumor&#xD;
           response, as defined by RECIST criteria, in patients with metastatic, HER2-negative&#xD;
           breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate time to disease progression in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate six-month progression-free survival of patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate time to treatment failure in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate clinical benefit rate (tumor response and stable disease) at 24 weeks in&#xD;
           patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate duration of response in patients treated with this regimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To evaluate the tolerability of this regimen in these patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To examine the relationship of gene expression and tissue/serum protein markers, where&#xD;
           available, related to response to therapy focusing on growth factor receptor pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a multicenter study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive oral sorafenib tosylate twice daily on days 1-28 and paclitaxel IV over 1&#xD;
      hour on days 1, 8, and 15. Treatment repeats every 28 days in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 4 weeks.&#xD;

    <description>Progression-free survival was defined as the time of treatment to the earliest date of documentation of disease progression or death due to any cause.
