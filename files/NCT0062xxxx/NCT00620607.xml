             documented disease progression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have confirmation of CanAg expression performed prior to enrollment by&#xD;
             immunohistochemical assessment for CanAg on archived biopsy samples.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have measurable disease with at least one lesion that can be accurately&#xD;
             measured by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors (RECIST). The lesion size&#xD;
             must be at least 20 mm by conventional radiological techniques or at least 10 mm by&#xD;
             spiral CT scan. Disease in an irradiated field as the only site of measurable disease&#xD;
             is acceptable if there has been a clear progression of the lesion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with reproductive potential must agree to use an effective contraceptive&#xD;
             method during the study and for 30 days after receiving the last dose of study drug.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a negative urine or serum pregnancy&#xD;
             test within one week prior to enrollment in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have any chemotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy, radiotherapy for&#xD;
             cancer or surgery (except for minor surgical procedures) completed at least 3 weeks&#xD;
             before starting study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have resolution of all clinically significant toxic effects (excluding&#xD;
             alopecia) of any prior treatments including surgery, radiotherapy, hormone therapy,&#xD;
             immunotherapy, targeted non-cytotoxic therapy, or chemotherapy to grade ≤ 1 by NCI&#xD;
             CTCAE v. 3.0 unless otherwise specified in the inclusion laboratory values.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients must have adequate organ function including:&#xD;

&#xD;
                  i. Absolute neutrophil count &gt; 1,500/mm3. ii. Platelet count &gt; 100,000/mm3. iii.&#xD;
                  Hemoglobin &gt; 9 g/dL (transfusion allowed).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Renal:&#xD;

                  creatinine clearance &gt; 60 mL/min/1.73m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Hepatic:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  i. Alanine aminotransferase (ALT), or aspartate aminotransferase (AST) ≤ 2.5 x&#xD;

&#xD;
                  Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or lactating women. Women of childbearing potential (WCBP) must have a&#xD;
             negative urine or blood test for pregnancy before first treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known hypersensitivity to previous monoclonal antibody therapy or maytansinoids.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active and uncontrolled infection.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Patients with peripheral neuropathy grade 2 or greater.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with known leptomeningeal disease or progressive brain metastasis. Routine&#xD;
             screening with CNS imaging studies (CT or MRI) is required only if clinically&#xD;
             indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with concomitant malignancies or previous malignancies with less than a 2&#xD;
             year disease free interval at the time of dosing. Patients with adequately treated&#xD;
             basal or squamous cell carcinoma of the skin, carcinoma in situ of the cervix or Stage&#xD;
             A low-grade prostate cancer may enroll irrespective of the time of diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are receiving concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, radiotherapy, or&#xD;
             investigational therapy. Radiotherapy for palliation of related bone metastases is&#xD;
             permitted upon the agreement between the investigator and the ImmunoGen Medical&#xD;
             Monitor and as long as radiation does not involve target lesions that are followed for&#xD;
             drug treatment response evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with any severe concurrent disease or condition, which in the judgment of the&#xD;
             Investigator, would make the patient inappropriate for study participation. The&#xD;
             disease or condition include, but are not limited to, one or more of the following:&#xD;
             bleeding diathesis, uncontrolled chronic kidney or liver disease, uncontrolled&#xD;
             diabetes, history of cardiac disease, myocardial infarction within the past 6 months,&#xD;
             congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, and&#xD;
             uncontrolled hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who must use contact lenses and cannot discontinue use of their contact&#xD;
             lenses during the course of the clinical study. Patients must discontinue use of&#xD;
