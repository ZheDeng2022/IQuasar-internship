  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this prospective single center study, up to 25 patients with Barrett's esophagus with LGD&#xD;
      or no dysplasia (Group 1), 25 patients with HGD/IMCA (Group 2), 25 patients with esophageal&#xD;
      carcinoma confined to the esophageal wall (Group 3) and 25 patients with severe esophageal&#xD;
      squamous dysplasia (Group 4) will be treated with endoscopic cryotherapy. This study is&#xD;
      single arm and no blinding will be utilized. Interim analysis of the data will be reviewed&#xD;
      with a DCI statistician after 14 patients in each group have been treated with cryotherapy&#xD;
      and if safety and efficacy is documented to that point in time, we will request the ability&#xD;
      to extend the enrollment to a maximum allowable amount of 25 patients per group. The proposed&#xD;
      study duration is seven years, allowing two years for patient enrollment and 5 years for post&#xD;
      treatment follow-up. Study duration per patient will total approximately six years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with Barrett's esophagus with no dysplasia or low grade dysplasia (group 1) will be&#xD;
      treated with cryotherapy at six week intervals until Barrett's mucosa is ablated or six&#xD;
      treatments are administered. Patients with Barrett's HGD and IMCA or severe esophageal&#xD;
      squamous dysplasia (groups 2 and 4) will be treated with cryotherapy at six-week intervals&#xD;
      until Barrett's mucosa is ablated or six treatments are administered. More advanced mass&#xD;
      lesions are typically more difficult to eradicate with ablative therapies and may progress&#xD;
      faster than patients with IMCA, therefore, patients with more advanced cancer (group 3) will&#xD;
      be treated every 2 weeks until the lesion is eradicated up to eight treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After cryotherapy treatment is complete (i.e. the esophagus has re-epithelialized with normal&#xD;
      squamous epithelium for Groups 1, 2, 4 and the tumor is locally controlled/absent in Group&#xD;
      3), patients will be assessed by endoscopy and biopsy every three months for one year, every&#xD;
      six months for two years, then annually for two years (flow sheet - appendix 1; study&#xD;
      schedule - appendix 2).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Baseline evaluation will include the following ( all are considered standard of care except #&#xD;
      8 ):&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Evaluation of inclusion/exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Demographics- date of birth, age, gender, ethnicity&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Medical history and physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Imaging (groups 2, 3 and 4) i. CT scan of the chest and abdomen with oral and&#xD;
           intravenous contrast (if not allergic) ii. Endoscopic Ultrasound, with evaluation of the&#xD;
           esophageal wall and mediastinum and upper abdomen for evidence of abnormal lymph nodes.&#xD;
           Suspicious lymph nodes (round, hypoechoic, homogeneous, &gt; 5mm) will undergo EUS-guided&#xD;
           fine needle aspiration if appropriate, as deemed by the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Pathology review (groups 2 and 4) - two independent reviewers, including at least one&#xD;
           from the WRAMC Pathology Department, will review the pathology slides from esophageal&#xD;
           biopsies. This review will serve to confirm the diagnosis of Barrett's esophagus with&#xD;
           high grade dysplasia and/or IMCA for agreement of the diagnosis of adenocarcinoma and&#xD;
           the degree of dysplasia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Presentation at Tumor Board prior to entering the protocol (groups 2, 3 and 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Dysphagia score (see Appendix 4) is for research purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to cryotherapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
      As part of the research protocol, all patients will be treated with high dose proton pump&#xD;
      inhibitor (PPI) (lansoprazole 30mg, esomeprazole 40mg, pantoprazole 40mg, omeprazole 40mg or&#xD;
      rabeprazole 40mg) BID for maximal acid suppression until complete ablation is achieved or the&#xD;
      patient exits the study. All of these agents are considered equally effective at the doses&#xD;
      listed with no one agent considered superior. Treatment with these research doses will begin&#xD;
      at least one week prior to the first cryotherapy session. Pre-enrollment standard doses of&#xD;
      PPI will be restarted once the patient enters the surveillance phase or exits the study. Care&#xD;
      will be taken to avoid, if possible, any potentially toxic medications to the esophageal&#xD;
      mucosa (i.e. non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, bisphosphonates, potassium supplements).&#xD;
&#xD;
      EGD/Cryotherapy Patients will be scheduled for EGD with cryotherapy on designated days when&#xD;
      support for the cryotherapy device is available according to the study timeline (Appendix 2).&#xD;
      A commitment from the CSA Medical Inc. (Baltimore, MD) will provide technical support for&#xD;
      sessions to allow patients timely treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will prepare for EGD in the standard fashion using an overnight fast with only sips&#xD;
      of clear liquids and required medications allowed up to 2 hours before the procedure.&#xD;
      Patients will be interviewed prior to the procedure using a standardized questionnaire&#xD;
      (Appendix 3). This questionnaire will assess overall sense of well-being, general state of&#xD;
      health, ability to perform activities of daily living, and ability to eat. It will&#xD;
      specifically solicit symptoms of chest pain, irregular heart rate, shortness of breath,&#xD;
      dysphagia or odynophagia. A dysphagia score will also be measured (appendix 4).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moderate sedation with intravenous meperidine or fentanyl and midazolam will be administered&#xD;
      and staff investigators will perform the EGD using a therapeutic upper endoscope with&#xD;
      adherence to standard protocol. A 14 to 18 French nasogastric tube which has been modified&#xD;
      with decompression ports spanning the distal 12 inches of the tube (to allow decompression of&#xD;
      both the stomach and the esophagus) will be placed into the stomach under direct&#xD;
      visualization. This is connected to continuous suction to allow decompression during the&#xD;
      cryotherapy procedure. During the procedure an assistant will monitor and record the heart&#xD;
      rate, blood pressure and oxygen saturation per WRAMC moderate sedation guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All subjects will be treated with narcotic analgesics and anti-emetics as needed after each&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Groups 1, 2 and 4 At the first procedure, the most proximal edge of the squamocolumnar&#xD;
      junction (SCJ) and the tips of the gastric folds (gastroesophageal junction of GEJ) will be&#xD;
      marked with a submucosal tattoo of India ink (SPOT, GI Supply, Camp Hill, PA) using a&#xD;
      standard sclerotherapy needle (if not already performed). The ink tattoo will guide&#xD;
      measurement of response to ablation and sampling the neo-squamous segment for residual&#xD;
      Barrett's during follow up exams. For severe esophageal squamous dysplasia, the tattoo will&#xD;
      be applied at the proximal and distal margins of the dysplastic area. If not allergic to&#xD;
      iodine, Lugol's solution will be used to stain the squamous mucosa during the exam to outline&#xD;
      the area of severe squamous dysplasia and guide the tattoo placement. Lugol's is chosen since&#xD;
      normal squamous, but not dysplasia or carcinoma stains with this vital stain. These marks are&#xD;
      placed for research purposes only and help to ensure that accurate measurements to assess the&#xD;
      change of Barrett's segment with therapy are recorded. (30) The location of the&#xD;
      squamocolumnar junction (SCJ), the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) and diaphragmatic hiatus&#xD;
      (DH) will be documented in terms of centimeters from the incisors. Any islands of squamous&#xD;
      tissue within the Barrett's segment will be photographed, measured, and recorded. If the SCJ&#xD;
      is not well visualized, chromoendoscopy with Lugol's solution, which highlights the squamous&#xD;
      epithelium, will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cryocatheter is passed into the therapeutic channel of the endoscope and extended one cm&#xD;
      beyond the distal tip of the scope. Liquid nitrogen is sprayed through the cryocatheter,&#xD;
      which causes a white frost (cryoburn) on the adjacent mucosa. The most distal aspect of the&#xD;
      Barrett's esophagus segment is treated first and the endoscope is slowly withdrawn&#xD;
      proximally, maneuvering the tip of the cryocatheter such that the cryoburn is extended to&#xD;
      &quot;paint&quot; a white frost cryoburn circumferentially. The spray will be applied for duration of&#xD;
      10 seconds as measured by the integrated device timer. During each cryotherapy session, the&#xD;
      process will be repeated up to four times in piecemeal fashion such that for any given area&#xD;
      treated it will be maintained in a frozen state for a total of 40 seconds. A frozen state&#xD;
      will be defined as mucosa appearing white.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the completion of the endoscopic procedure, the patients are monitored in our recovery&#xD;
      area until completely awake, alert and able to be discharged according to our standard&#xD;
      conscious sedation policy. Following discharge from the endoscopy suite, patients will be&#xD;
      contacted in one week by telephone to assess for any immediate complications. A questionnaire&#xD;
      will be completed by the study physician or nurse (appendix 3). Patients will be seen the&#xD;
      same day in the clinic or endoscopy center for any serious concerns (patient or study&#xD;
      personnel).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will return in 6 weeks (groups 1, 2 and 4) for reassessment with a repeat EGD and&#xD;
      cryotherapy for residual Barrett's mucosa. The interview questionnaire and dysphagia score&#xD;
      will be repeated before each EGD. The location of the SCJ, the EGJ and DH and dysplastic&#xD;
      region will be recorded and photographed to characterize the precise size and location of any&#xD;
      islands of squamous tissue within the Barrett's segment. If there is gross evidence of&#xD;
      mucosal injury due to the previous cryotherapy (any mucosal break including erosions, tears,&#xD;
      or ulcers) the procedure will be terminated and further ablation will be held for an&#xD;
      additional 2 weeks. If there is no gross evidence of esophageal mucosal injury, cryotherapy&#xD;
      will be repeated. The process will continue until complete ablation of the Barrett's mucosa&#xD;
      has been achieved or the maximum number of treatment sessions has been performed (8&#xD;
      treatments total).&#xD;
&#xD;
      When it appears endoscopically that all or nearly all of the mucosa has been replaced with&#xD;
      normal appearing squamous mucosa, a biopsy or several biopsies may be taken at the discretion&#xD;
      of the endoscopist of any suspicious areas to confirm that cryotherapy has been completed.&#xD;
      When such &quot;quick look&quot; biopsies have been taken, no cryotherapy will be performed that day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the pathology results return revealing sub-squamous intestinal metaplasia or dysplasia,&#xD;
      cryotherapy may be resumed two weeks after the biopsies had been taken (to allow adequate&#xD;
      time for the mucosa to have healed). If the biopsy confirms resolution, the patient will then&#xD;
      be scheduled for post-cryotherapy surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies taken during these endoscopies will be used only for the clinical purpose of&#xD;
      assessing the patient's histologic response to cryotherapy. As such, no excess tissue will be&#xD;
      collected or stored for any purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 3 patients will undergo cryotherapy with intent to ablate the neoplasia. Group 3&#xD;
      patients with long segment Barrett's esophagus will undergo ablation of only the nodular&#xD;
      areas and/or mass lesions. Flat Barrett's will not be treated. The mass lesion will be&#xD;
      treated in its entirety until frozen or up to 20 seconds. This will be repeated for a total&#xD;
      treatment time of 60 seconds.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow up endoscopy to allow repeat treatment with cryotherapy will be every two weeks until&#xD;
      the lesion is eradicated or is treated up to 8 times, whichever comes first. These patients&#xD;
      are being offered more aggressive therapy (every 2 weeks rather than every 6 weeks), due to&#xD;
      the presence of more advanced disease. Treatment will be withheld for evidence of active&#xD;
      ulceration and will not be resumed until this has healed. When it appears endoscopically that&#xD;
      the cancer has been eradicated and all or nearly all of the mucosa has been replaced with&#xD;
      normal appearing squamous mucosa, a biopsy or several biopsies may be taken at the discretion&#xD;
      of the endoscopist of any suspicious areas to confirm that cryotherapy has been completed.&#xD;
      When such &quot;quick look&quot; biopsies have been taken, no cryotherapy will be performed that day.&#xD;
      If the pathology results return revealing sub-squamous intestinal metaplasia, dysplasia or&#xD;
      cancer, cryotherapy may be resumed. If the biopsy confirms resolution, the patient will then&#xD;
      be scheduled for post-cryotherapy surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Biopsies taken during these endoscopies will be used only for the clinical purpose of&#xD;
      assessing the patient's histologic response to cryotherapy. As such, no excess tissue will be&#xD;
      collected or stored for any purposes. No blood will be drawn for this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The initial EGD procedures are estimated to require up to 45 minutes to perform due to the&#xD;
      possible need to perform Lugol's staining and/or India ink marking of the esophagus.&#xD;
      Subsequent re-treatment EGD's are estimated to require no more than 30 minutes to perform. An&#xD;
      EGD that reveals healing where only &quot;quick look&quot; biopsies are taken will take no more than 10&#xD;
      minutes to perform.&#xD;
