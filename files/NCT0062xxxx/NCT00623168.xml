    <textblock>
      Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) is caused by a virus acquired by contact with&#xD;
      chronically infected rodent hosts. HFRS is present throughout Korea. Treatment consists&#xD;
      mainly of supportive care with careful attention to control of blood pressure and fluid&#xD;
      balance and/or dialysis. Early initiation of IND Intravenous Ribavirin has been shown to be&#xD;
      an effective treatment for HFRS and may prevent the need for dialysis. It is important to&#xD;
      initiate therapy based on a diagnosis consistent with HFRS and a history that makes exposure&#xD;
      likely. This study will monitor the clinical events that occur with HFRS as well as the&#xD;
      safety and efficacy of Ribavirin.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) is caused by viruses in the genus Hantavirus of&#xD;
      the family Bunyaviridae. There are four known Hantavirus that cause HFRS: Hantaan, Seoul,&#xD;
      Puumala and Dobrava viruses. HFRS is acquired by contact with chronically infected rodent&#xD;
      hosts, most commonly from inhalation of infected rodent excreta. Hemorrhagic fever with renal&#xD;
      syndrome is characterized clinically by the triad of fever, hemorrhage and renal&#xD;
      insufficiency. HFRS typically consists of five consecutive but frequently overlapping&#xD;
      clinical phases: febrile, hypotensive, oliguric, diuretic and convalescent. DoD operations&#xD;
      have resulted in the deployment of personnel in Europe and Southeast Asia, areas endemic for&#xD;
      HFRS, a viral hemorrhagic fever. Early initiation of therapy with intravenous Ribavirin has&#xD;
      been shown to be an effective treatment for HFRS. It is therefore important to initiate&#xD;
      therapy based on a clinical diagnosis consistent with viral hemorrhagic fever and with an&#xD;
      epidemiological history for risk of exposure to the hantavirus. Ribavirin is a nucleoside&#xD;
      (guanosine) analog with activity against a wide variety ribonucleic acid and deoxyribonucleic&#xD;
      acid viruses. Mechanism of action is not fully defined. The mechanism may be related to&#xD;
      alteration of cellular nucleotide pools and of viral messenger RNA formation, but recent data&#xD;
      suggest the mechanism of Ribavirin in HFRS may be to serve as a RNA virus mutagen resulting&#xD;
      in an &quot;extinction catastrophe&quot; error, as a result of incorporation in the viral RNA genome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ribavirin is licensed in the United States in aerosol form for the treatment of severe lower&#xD;
      respiratory tract infection in children and in the oral formulation in combination with&#xD;
      recombinant interferon alpha for the treatment of chronic hepatitis C infection. The&#xD;
      intravenous formulation of ribavirin in not licensed in the United States. IV Ribavirin for&#xD;
      the treatment of HFRS is used under IND 16,666.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a Phase 2, open-label study of the safety of IV Ribavirin treatment in individuals&#xD;
      with Hemorrhagic Fever with Renal Syndrome (HFRS) admitted to the 121st Combat Support&#xD;
      Hospital, Seoul, Republic of Korea. The study will also monitor morbidity and mortality of&#xD;
      subjects with HFRS who are treated with IV Ribavirin. The study population will include all&#xD;
      subjects with a probable or suspected clinical diagnosis of HFRS, at least 18 years of age&#xD;
      (age 17 if active military) but not greater than 65 years of age. The Investigators intend to&#xD;
      treat all individuals who present with a tentative diagnosis of HFRS (and within 7 days of&#xD;
      onset of illness) and meet entry criteria with a 7 day course of IV Ribavirin and a 28-60 day&#xD;
      follow up period after first dose of Ribavirin. In addition to treatment with Ribavirin, all&#xD;
      subjects will be given standard supportive and symptomatic care as determined by the clinical&#xD;
      judgment of attending physicians or consultants who manage the subject's care at the 121 CSH.&#xD;
      Up to 50 subjects could potentially be enrolled in a five year time period with an expected&#xD;
      accrual of 0-5 subjects per year, but the number may be higher (10 to 20 persons in a year)&#xD;
      if an HFRS outbreak should occur. Specific inclusion/exclusion/relative exclusion criteria&#xD;
      are a part of the protocol. Safety procedures required during 7 days of treatment include&#xD;
      continuous cardiac monitoring, daily lab work, physical exams and vital signs.&#xD;
