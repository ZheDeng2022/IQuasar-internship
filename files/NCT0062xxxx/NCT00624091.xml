      Background: Prognosis of infective endocarditis is poor and has remained steady over the last&#xD;
      four decades. Several nonrandomized studies suggest that early surgery could improve&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: The early surgery in infective endocarditis study (ENDOVAL 1) is a multicenter,&#xD;
      prospective, randomized study designed to compare the state-of-the-art therapeutic strategy&#xD;
      (that advised by the international societies in their guidelines) with the early surgery&#xD;
      strategy in high-risk patients with infective endocarditis. Patients with infective&#xD;
      endocarditis without indication for surgery will be included if they meet at least one of the&#xD;
      following: 1) early-onset prosthetic endocarditis; 2) Staphylococcus aureus endocarditis; 3)&#xD;
      periannular complications; 4) new-onset conduction abnormalities; 5) vegetations longer than&#xD;
      10 mm in diameter; 6) new-onset severe valvular disfunction. A total of 216 patients will be&#xD;
      randomized to either of the two strategies. Stratification will be done within 3 days of&#xD;
      admission. In the early surgery arm, the procedure will be performed within 48 hours of&#xD;
      randomization. The only event to be considered will be death within 30 days. The study will&#xD;
      be extended to 1 year. In the follow-up substudy, death and a new episode of endocarditis&#xD;
      will be regarded as events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Conclusion: The early surgery in infective endocarditis study (ENDOVAL 1), the first&#xD;
      randomized in endocarditis, will provide crucial information regarding the putative benefit&#xD;
      of early surgery over the state-of-the-art therapeutic approach in high-risk patients with&#xD;
      infective endocarditis.&#xD;

      BACKGROUND Whereas mortality has been dramatically reduced in some areas of cardiac diseases&#xD;
      thanks to continuous progress in treatment, endocarditis remains a high-mortality disease&#xD;
      with steady percentages of mortality in the last 30 years. Several reasons may help to&#xD;
      account for this frustrating comparison. The changing pattern of the epidemiology of&#xD;
      endocarditis surely has contributed to the still high mortality. Patients are older,&#xD;
      prosthetic and nosocomial endocarditis are currently more frequent, and Staphylococcus aureus&#xD;
      has increased as the causative agent. But clinical investigators on this field must be aware&#xD;
      of our fault in not generating evidence-based investigations. A paucity of comprehensive&#xD;
      information exists and high-quality evidence is lacking. In fact, not even a single&#xD;
      randomized study is available regarding the most challenging decision in endocarditis which&#xD;
      is to decide whether and when surgery has to be undertaken in the active phase of the&#xD;
      disease. Therefore, guidelines on treatment in endocarditis endorsed by the most prestigious&#xD;
      scientific societies are supported by moderate (level B) or low level of evidence (level C).&#xD;
      Not even a single recommendation on medical versus surgical treatment is based on a high&#xD;
      level of evidence (level A). Unfortunately, it is still true that &quot;there is still as much art&#xD;
      as science in the care of patients with endocarditis&quot;. The only way investigators can balance&#xD;
      the tip in favour of science is promoting randomized clinical studies with power enough to&#xD;
      answer unsettled crucial clinical questions. Some encourage taking this track; it has been&#xD;
      suggested by others, however, that a randomized study comparing medical versus surgical&#xD;
      treatment in endocarditis cannot be undertaken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      American and European guidelines state with level of evidence B or C, and with subtle&#xD;
      differences, that surgery should be considered in active endocarditis in the following&#xD;
      situations: heart failure, valve abnormalities (dehiscence, perforation or rupture),&#xD;
      periannular complications, persistent vegetation after systemic embolization, increase in&#xD;
      vegetation size despite appropriate antibiotics, persistent infection, and infection by&#xD;
      microorganisms known not to be cured by antimicrobial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All those indications are well-known predictors of poor short-term outcome in infective&#xD;
      endocarditis and surgery is presumed to favourably alter that prognosis. However, it is&#xD;
      already known that results of surgery are worse if patients have heart failure or persistent&#xD;
      infection. Besides, those predictors very frequently appear after several days after the&#xD;
      initial diagnosis. Finally, early surgery in active endocarditis has shown a lower mortality&#xD;
      when compared to the usual medico-surgical approach. Based on this background, we hypothesize&#xD;
      that if we wait for predictors of poor prognosis to appear, surgery may come too late. If,&#xD;
      nonetheless, surgery is performed within the first 3 days after admission in patients with a&#xD;
      high-risk profile before the clinical course worsens, prognosis may be improved. To test this&#xD;
      hypothesis, factors which define early high-risk profile have to be identified. With this&#xD;
      aim, we undertook a prospective, multicenter study in 317 patients with left-sided&#xD;
      endocarditis and demonstrated that heart failure, Staphylococcus aureus and periannular&#xD;
      complications detected within 72 hours after admission identified patients with poor&#xD;
      prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary, predictors of poor prognosis available within 72 hours after admission can&#xD;
      accurately identify high-risk patients. The initial clinical profile and the results of the&#xD;
      first transesophageal echocardiogram and the initial blood cultures are accurate enough to&#xD;
      stratify patients into high- and low-risk. Whether early surgery can improve prognosis when&#xD;
      undertaken in the former is an attractive hypothesis never tested so far.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once we are able to early identify a high-risk profile in infective endocarditis the&#xD;
      following step has to be a randomized study in which the state-of-the-art therapeutic&#xD;
      strategy for patients with endocarditis (medical treatment and surgery if predictors of poor&#xD;
      prognosis appear early or late in the disease process) is compared to an early surgical&#xD;
      approach. Of course, surgery and medical treatment cannot be compared and it would unethical&#xD;
      doing so. What we are designing is a study to compare two different therapeutical strategies&#xD;
      in high-risk patients, the state-of-the art approach, proposed by the international&#xD;
      societies, and the early surgery strategy which includes two consecutive steps: 1)&#xD;
      identification of high-risk patients by means of predictors available within 72 hours of&#xD;
      admission; 2) surgery within 48 hours of inclusion of a patient in the high-risk group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      METHODS&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypothesis Our hypothesis is that early surgery in high-risk patients with active&#xD;
      infective endocarditis decreases mortality and should be considered the treatment of choice&#xD;
      in this population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study objectives Our objective is to compare the 30 days mortality rate in high-risk patients&#xD;
      with active infective endocarditis between an early surgical approach (surgery performed&#xD;
      within the first 48 hours after inclusion or 5 days after the initial diagnosis) and the&#xD;
      state-of-the-art treatment in this disease (medical treatment followed by surgery if&#xD;
      predictors of poor prognosis appear early or late).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population Our initial study population is made up of patients with active infective&#xD;
      endocarditis in the initial phase of the disease (less than 5 days of the diagnosis) who do&#xD;
      not meet the exclusion criteria (table I). Diagnosis of infective endocarditis will be&#xD;
      performed according to modified Duke criteria. Patients who require urgent surgery (heart&#xD;
      failure, septic shock, or fungal endocarditis) are rapidly sent to surgery. Patients with&#xD;
      more than 5 days between the diagnosis and the first contact with our centres are excluded&#xD;
      since the concept of early surgery cannot be applied to them. A surgical risk over 40%&#xD;
      calculated by means of the logistic Euroscore system are also excluded since their&#xD;
      preoperative status is so poor that the surgical risk prohibits a surgical approach. Patients&#xD;
      with ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke are also excluded given its very difficult management&#xD;
      during the perioperative period which may introduce bias in the results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design Patients without any exclusion criteria will be divided into two groups&#xD;
      according to the risk profile. When the patient does not fulfil any of the high-risk&#xD;
      criteria, he or she is considered a low-risk patient and is managed with the state-of-the-art&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy, according to the guidelines accepted by the different international&#xD;
      societies: medical management by a multidisciplinary team is accomplished. A complete&#xD;
      clinical examination is done every day. Blood and urine analysis, chest X-ray, EKG and blood&#xD;
      cultures are taken initially, and every 7 days. Transthoracic and ransesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography is performed initially. All the previous tests, including transesophageal&#xD;
      echocardiography, are performed always the clinical status changes. CT scan is indicated when&#xD;
      stroke or peripheral emboli are clinically suspected. Surgery is considered and decided in an&#xD;
      individual basis when any of the following is present: heart failure, periannular&#xD;
      complications, persistent &gt;10 mm vegetation after systemic embolization, or persistent&#xD;
      infection (fever or positive blood cultures after 7 days of correct antibiotic treatment once&#xD;
      other sources of fever are ruled out). The specific surgical technique will be decided by the&#xD;
      surgeon according to the degree of tissular destruction and will be aimed to remove the&#xD;
      infected tissue and to repair the damaged structures or, if this is not feasible, to implant&#xD;
      cardiovascular prosthesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the patient meets any of the high-risk criteria, he or she is randomized to the&#xD;
      state-of-the-art therapeutic strategy aforementioned or the early surgical strategy. In the&#xD;
      latter, surgery must be performed within 48 hours after randomization. Therefore, the time&#xD;
      from the first contact to the hospital to surgery cannot be longer than 5 days (3 days to&#xD;
      have the transesophageal exam and the blood cultures available and 2 days for randomization&#xD;
      to surgery). The study flow chart is shown in figure 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only event to be considered in the statistical analysis will be death within 30 days of&#xD;
      admission. The study will be prolonged and patients will be followed for 1 year. In the&#xD;
      long-term analysis death and a new episode of endocarditis will be considered the only&#xD;
      events. Table II depicts the study schedule and procedures. Table III depicts the long-term&#xD;
      substudy schedule and procedures&#xD;
&#xD;
      The protocol has been approved by the local ethical committee of the following institutions:&#xD;
      1) Universitary Clinic Hospital, Valladolid, Spain; 2) Universitary Clinic Hospital San&#xD;
      Carlos, Madrid, Spain; 3) Universitary Clinic Hospital Valle Hebrón, Barcelona, Spain. It is&#xD;
      currently being evaluated by cardiologists and cardiac surgeons from: 1) Universitary Clinic&#xD;
      Hospital Gregorio Marañón, Madrid, Spain; 2) Clínic Hospital, Barcelona, Spain; 3) German&#xD;
      Trias i Pujol Hospital, Badalona, Barcelona, Spain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STATISTICAL CONSIDERATIONS Determination of sample size The study will be powered to address&#xD;
      the primary hypothesis that a decision to operate on an urgent basis patients with high-risk&#xD;
      endocarditis will decrease in-hospital mortality compared to patients managed with the&#xD;
      state-to-art strategy. Thus, the sample size was calculated based on the assumption of an 30%&#xD;
      of mortality in the state-to-art group (19) versus 13% in the early surgery group (17%&#xD;
      relative reduction). A sample size of 206 patients will produce a study power of 80% with a&#xD;
      2-sided α level of .05. As a result, assuming a 5% of losses during the study period, a&#xD;
      sample size of 216 enrolled patients is needed with 108 in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization Once the patient has complied with protocol requirements and has signed the&#xD;
      informed consent, he or she will be included in the study and randomized to one of the two&#xD;
      strategies. Randomization will be performed with blocks of four and six patients by an&#xD;
      automated assignment system. Blocks will be re-randomized to avoid knowing block size. All&#xD;
      calculations have been performed with C4-Study design pack (Glaxo Wellcome V1.1)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The independence will be guaranteed because the person who makes the process will be contact&#xD;
      by telephone and will not take any clinical decision about the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety issues An intermediate analysis will be done to control the quality of the information&#xD;
      collected and to contrast the hypothesis of the study. The study will be stopped if a rate of&#xD;
      adverse event higher than expected is observed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis Once that information has been collected and checked, the statistical&#xD;
      analysis will begin. Statistical analysis of data will follow the intention-to-treat&#xD;
      principle, that is, patients will be analyzed according to the treatment arm to which they&#xD;
      were randomized, regardless of adherence to the assigned treatment. Continuous variables will&#xD;
      be compared with t-Student test and U Mann-Whitney test for non-normally distributed&#xD;
      variables and categorical variables will be compared with Chi-Square test and Fisher's exact&#xD;
      test when appropriate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The distribution of time to event variables will be estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method,&#xD;
      treatment effects will be compared with log-rank test. The Cox regression method will be used&#xD;
      to estimate the hazard ratio and 95% confidence interval. All test will be two-sided and p&#xD;
      values of less then 0.05 will be considered to indicate statistical significance. Statistical&#xD;
      analysis will be performed with SPSS software V 14.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)&#xD;
