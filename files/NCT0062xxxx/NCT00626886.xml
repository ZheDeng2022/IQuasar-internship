  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is safe and&#xD;
      effective in reducing the amount of narcotic pain medication needed to control pain during&#xD;
      the first 24 hours after herniorrhaphy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Inguinal herniorrhaphy is a common surgery; and common surgical methods used include&#xD;
      laparoscopic and open placement of synthetic mesh. The use of synthetic mesh can greatly&#xD;
      reduce the risk of hernia recurrence regardless of the method used for its placement.&#xD;
      Managing postoperative pain and preventing morbidity after open mesh herniorrhaphy remain&#xD;
      considerable medical challenges.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bupivacaine is a local anesthetic (pain medicine) that has an established safety profile.&#xD;
      Collagen is a protein that is found in all mammals. The CollaRx Bupivacaine implant is a thin&#xD;
      flat sponge made out of collagen that comes from cow tendons and contains bupivacaine. When&#xD;
      inserted into a surgical site, the collagen breaks down and bupivacaine is released at the&#xD;
      site but very little is absorbed into the blood stream. The high levels of bupivacaine at the&#xD;
      surgical site may result in less pain for several days after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will compare the amount of narcotic pain medication required after surgery in&#xD;
      patients who receive either the CollaRx Bupivacaine implant or a plain collagen sponge.&#xD;

    <description>Summed pain intensity (SPI) (VAS at rest and after cough): - For the VAS assessment, patients measured their pain intensity at rest and after aggravated movement (cough) using a horizontal 100-mm VAS scale labeled as follows: No Pain (0 mm) as the left anchor and Worst Pain Imaginable (100 mm) as the right anchor. Each timepoint consist of two measurements (Resting &amp; Coughing) - The lower the score the better outcome for the patient. The highest total score (worst possible score) for the 10 timepoints would be 2000.</description>

Each timepoint consist of two measurements (Resting &amp; Coughing) - The lower the score the better outcome for the patient. The highest total score (worst possible score) for the 10 timepoints would be 2000.</description>
