  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objectives of the trial are to assess the safety and efficacy of ProSavin.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients in the trial will have been diagnosed with Parkinson's disease and will be failing&#xD;
      on current treatment with L-DOPA but they will not have progressed to drug-induced&#xD;
      dyskinesias. The first stage is an open-label dose escalation to evaluate up to three dose&#xD;
      levels of ProSavin in cohorts of three patients each. Following a recommendation by the DMC&#xD;
      the study may proceed to the second stage of the trial, a further 12 patients will be&#xD;
      recruited to confirm efficacy of the optimal dose in the randomized phase of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The efficacy of ProSavin will be assessed using the Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Score&#xD;
      (UPDRS). Patients will be monitored at regular intervals, with the primary endpoint being an&#xD;
      efficacy assessment at six months after treatment. The secondary objective of the trial is to&#xD;
      asses the extent to which patients' current therapy (L-DOPA) can be reduced following&#xD;
      administration of ProSavin.&#xD;
