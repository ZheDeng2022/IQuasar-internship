  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of injecting myoblasts&#xD;
      (grown from your own skeletal muscle), using a catheter device, directly into the damaged&#xD;
      heart muscle for treatment of severe heart failure.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Given the limited treatment options available to patients with congestive heart failure,&#xD;
      there is a need for alternative therapies. Autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation has&#xD;
      been demonstrated in pre-clinical studies to be a safe and effective treatment of heart&#xD;
      failure. Initial clinical studies have shown that autologous myoblasts can be delivered into&#xD;
      infracted myocardium by both direct epicardial and endomyocardial injection. However,&#xD;
      autologous skeletal myoblast transplantation via percutaneous endomyocardial injection has&#xD;
      the potential to play a significant role in such congestive heart failure patients without&#xD;
      the need for surgical risk and general anesthesia. Thus, a Phase 2 clinical trial is proposed&#xD;
      in order to evaluate the effectiveness of autologous myoblast delivered by endomyocardial&#xD;
      injection for the treatment congestive heart failure.&#xD;
