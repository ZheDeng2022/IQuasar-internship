  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A combination of the corticosteroid GW685698X and the long-acting ß2-agonist GW642444M is&#xD;
      being developed for once daily administration for the maintenance treatment of asthma and&#xD;
      COPD. GW642444M and GW685698X will be simultaneously co-administered from a single device and&#xD;
      compared with GW642444M and GW685698X administered separately in order to determine whether&#xD;
      co-administration affects the safety, tolerability, pharmacodynamic and/or pharmacokinetics&#xD;
      of either compound in healthy Japanese subjects.&#xD;
