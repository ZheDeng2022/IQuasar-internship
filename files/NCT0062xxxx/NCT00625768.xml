        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Be 18 years or older at the time of giving informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically confirmed diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If renal cell carcinoma, of clear cell or chromophilic/papillary type, with metastases&#xD;
             at any site (but excluding patients with single bony lesion only).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If malignant melanoma, unresectable Stage III disease or Stage IV disease, with&#xD;
             metastases at any site (but excluding patients with single bony lesion only)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with clinically stable CNS metastases may enter who have been treated with&#xD;
             surgery or radiation and who do not require steroid therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance status 0-2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior systemic treatment for their malignancy with&#xD;
             chemotherapeutic or biological therapies may enter, provided treatment was completed&#xD;
             within 4 weeks of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have received prior experimental therapy may enter, provided treatment&#xD;
             was completed within 12 weeks of study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate bone marrow function as evidenced by neutrophils &gt;1.5 x109/L and&#xD;
             platelets &gt;100 x109/L.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have adequate liver and kidney function, as shown by serum bilirubin ≤1.5x upper limit&#xD;
             of normal for the laboratory; ALT and AST both ≤2x upper limit of normal; and&#xD;
             creatinine ≤1.5x upper limit of normal.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have either evaluable or measurable disease (patients entering an ascending dosage&#xD;
             cohort) or measurable disease (patients entering the study after MTD is defined).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have failed and or are ineligible for standard first line therapy (in&#xD;
             accordance with individual institutional practice)&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients with any of the following will be excluded from the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients at poor medical risk because of non-malignant systemic disease or active&#xD;
             infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of clinically significant autoimmune or predominantly Th1-driven clinical&#xD;
             disorders (such as rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasis, chronic inflammatory bowel&#xD;
             disease, for example), with the exception of autoimmune endocrinopathies now treated&#xD;
             with replacement therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Substantive surgery within 4 weeks prior to study entry, or expectation of surgery&#xD;
             during the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Malignancy other than renal cell carcinoma or malignant melanoma within 5 years of&#xD;
             study entry, except for non-melanoma skin cancer and cervical intraepithelial&#xD;
             neoplasia treated definitively or other cancer from which the patient has been&#xD;
             disease-free for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with systemic steroids or with other immunosuppressive therapies.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  If female, pregnant or breastfeeding;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women of child bearing potential or sexually active males, unless (1) the patient (if&#xD;
             female, or the patient's partner, if male) is surgically sterile or (2) using adequate&#xD;
             contraception (defined as either IUD, oral or depot contraceptive, or barrier plus&#xD;
             spermicide) while receiving study treatment and for at least 6 months after&#xD;
             termination of treatment. Women must be post-menopausal for at least 2 years to be&#xD;
             considered of non-childbearing potential&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any concurrent medical or psychological condition that would limit the ability of the&#xD;
             patient to provide informed consent or to comply with the obligations of the study.&#xD;
