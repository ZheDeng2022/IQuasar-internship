  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      An implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD) is a small device that is implanted in the&#xD;
      chest and uses electrical shocks to control arrhythmias, which are abnormal heart rhythms.&#xD;
      Arrhythmias can be caused by many factors, including stress and anger. This study will&#xD;
      evaluate the use of a stress reduction treatment (SRT) program aimed at reducing the&#xD;
      occurrence of arrhythmias that require treatment with an ICD shock.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      An ICD is a device designed to quickly detect a life-threatening, rapid heartbeat. Through a&#xD;
      process called defibrillation, the ICD tries to convert an abnormal heart rhythm back to&#xD;
      normal by delivering an electrical shock to the heart. The ICD continuously monitors&#xD;
      heartbeats to ensure that they are normal, and it only delivers a shock to the heart when it&#xD;
      senses a life-threatening arrhythmia. Because of the recent funding approval by Medicaid, it&#xD;
      is now estimated that more than 500,000 people will receive ICDs annually. Although ICDs are&#xD;
      life-saving medical devices, some people may experience anxiety, depression, and impaired&#xD;
      quality of life as a result of the repeated ICD shocks. Additionally, increased mental and&#xD;
      emotional stress and anger may increase the likelihood of experiencing more arrhythmias&#xD;
      requiring an ICD shock. SRT programs that encourage people to manage their emotions may&#xD;
      decrease the frequency of arrhythmias. Furthermore, SRT programs have been shown to be&#xD;
      successful at reducing other stress-related heart conditions. The purpose of this study is to&#xD;
      evaluate the effectiveness of an SRT program at reducing the incidence of ICD shock-treated&#xD;
      arrhythmias among people with newly implanted ICDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will enroll people who have recently received an ICD. Initially, participants will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires about mood and attitudes. Next, at a baseline study visit,&#xD;
      participants will complete a mental stress exercise in which they will perform math problems&#xD;
      and describe an experience that made them angry. During this exercise, participants will&#xD;
      undergo blood pressure measurements, blood collection, and an electrocardiogram (EKG) to&#xD;
      measure electrical activity of the heart. Participants will also wear a monitor for 24 hours&#xD;
      after the study visit to record heart activity. Participants will then be randomly assigned&#xD;
      to either take part in the SRT group and receive usual care or only receive usual care. For&#xD;
      10 weeks, participants in the SRT group will attend 8 group sessions that will focus on&#xD;
      learning and applying stress reduction techniques to everyday living. All participants will&#xD;
      attend a 3-month follow-up visit for repeat baseline testing. At Months 6, 12, and 24,&#xD;
      participants will complete questionnaires during routine doctor's visits or by mail.&#xD;
