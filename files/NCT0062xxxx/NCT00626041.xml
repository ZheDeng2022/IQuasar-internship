      High blood pressure, elevated blood glucose and high cholesterol are related to the increased&#xD;
      risk of stroke and heart disease. Many studies have shown that this risk can be significantly&#xD;
      reduced by lowering blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Through a collaborative effort between Calgary Safeway pharmacists and Calgary Health Region&#xD;
      family physician PCN's, U-CHAMP will deliver a program to assist in the identification and&#xD;
      management of people with elevated blood pressure, blood glucose and cholesterol and through&#xD;
      this effort, reduce the risk of heart disease and stroke in the urban Calgary population aged&#xD;
      18-85 years.&#xD;

      Hypertension (HBP) has long been correlated with risk of stroke and other adverse&#xD;
      cardiovascular outcomes. Randomized controlled trials of blood pressure lowering have&#xD;
      demonstrated at least 30% reductions in stroke incidence and improved mortality. Despite&#xD;
      being such a readily modifiable risk, HBP remains under diagnosed and under treated. To&#xD;
      address this gap, the A-CHAMP (Airdrie Community Hypertension Awareness and Management&#xD;
      Program) was successfully piloted in Airdrie, a community of 20,000 north of Calgary,&#xD;
      Alberta. Trained volunteers held BP screening sessions for seniors in local pharmacies and&#xD;
      referred hypertensive participants to their GP's and trained pharmacists for blood pressure&#xD;
      management. Of the 408 screened participants (40% of all Airdrie seniors), 36.5% had&#xD;
      uncontrolled HBP. By program end, systolic BP was decreased by 16.8 mm (+/- 14.6. P &lt;.05) and&#xD;
      56.2% of hypertensive participants had reached the 2006 Canadian Hypertension Guideline&#xD;
      targets. Airdrie now holds annual blood pressure screenings organized and run by volunteers,&#xD;
      demonstrating the sustainability of this approach to population screening and risk factor&#xD;
      management in this setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to fully realize the benefits of cardiovascular risk reduction, U-CHAMP will be&#xD;
      expanded to include a more global risk assessment and management protocol including&#xD;
      assessments for dyslipidemias and diabetes in an urban setting.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this project is:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To expand the rural scope of A-CHAMP into a larger urban setting (Calgary).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To include a more global risk assessment (for both coronary artery disease and stroke)&#xD;
           and management including: cholesterol (total and HDL cholesterol) and diabetes&#xD;
           (capillary HgA1c when appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To effect fully sustainable practice change in the management of hypertension, diabetes&#xD;
           and dyslipidemias by establishing collaborative partnerships between pharmacists,&#xD;
           Calgary Health Region (CHR) physicians (Primary Care Networks: PCN's), the CHR Chronic&#xD;
           Disease Management Program (CDM), and selected hypertensive patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Components of U-CHAMP are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Screening Clinics:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 1: The pharmacist determines if the participant has diabetes then performs a&#xD;
                BP assessment using a BpTRU device (VSM MedTech, Vancouver, BC). The participant is&#xD;
                invited to sign the consent then six BP readings are taken 1 minute apart in the&#xD;
                non-dominant arm, and the last five readings averaged. If the average reading is&#xD;
                ≥140/90 mmHg (≥130/80 for diabetics), the participant is invited to return to a&#xD;
                second BP clinic within the next 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 2: BP is taken as above. If the average BP from both visits is ≥140/90 mmHg&#xD;
                (≥130/80 mmHg for those with diabetes), The client is invited to participate in the&#xD;
                program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Visit 2 continued: The pharmacist completes the assessment form which includes:&#xD;
                age, personal or family history of cardiovascular disease, known diabetes,&#xD;
                hypertension or dyslipidemia, lifestyle issues, medication list, medication&#xD;
                allergies, adherence history, adverse events experienced and non-prescription&#xD;
                medications used including herbs, vitamins, and supplements.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Baseline random capillary Total Cholesterol, HDL (Cholestech -LDX ® (Manthomed) and&#xD;
                HgA1c (DCA 2000) are obtained and with all the above information, the Framingham&#xD;
                global cardiovascular risk score is calculated (for those without known vascular&#xD;
                disease and those without diabetes). If the readings are above target (according to&#xD;
                the most recent Canadian Guidelines for hypertension, dyslipidemias and diabetes),&#xD;
                participants are encouraged to have their full lipid profile and HgA1c done by&#xD;
                their family physician and to record the results in a wallet card provided to them.&#xD;
                Counseling about global cardiovascular risk, medications (if applicable), lifestyle&#xD;
                information, a hypertension education pamphlet (CHEP 2007 public education) and a&#xD;
                wallet card are provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants are referred to their primary care physician for further&#xD;
                assessment/management. Assessment information with BP, lipid and HgA1c results and&#xD;
                any recommendations (according to latest Canadian Guidelines) including the least&#xD;
                expensive drug alternatives, are faxed to the participant's primary care physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants are asked to return for follow-up several times during the 6 to 12&#xD;
                month program. Participants are encouraged to follow up with their GP's after each&#xD;
                pharmacy visit (if appropriate).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  At each visit the participant's BP is re-checked. Medication counseling, lifestyle&#xD;
                and other information is reinforced and the BP handbook is updated. If appropriate,&#xD;
                any lipid, diabetes and global cardiovascular risk assessment data is recorded in&#xD;
                the participants' wallet card and is reviewed with them. Counseling about the&#xD;
                appropriate target levels is provided. Results of the assessment including&#xD;
                recommendations and the pharmacist's comments from each visit are faxed to the&#xD;
                participant's physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Final Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Participants are encouraged to obtain a full lipid profile through their family&#xD;
                physician (if appropriate) just prior to their final pharmacy visit (and bring the&#xD;
                results to this final visit) so that their Framingham global cardiovascular risk&#xD;
                can be recalculated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The participant's BP, random capillary Total and HDL cholesterol and HgA1c (if appropriate)&#xD;
      are measured. Their current medication list is confirmed and adherence information is&#xD;
      reviewed and recorded. The final lipid and diabetes lab data (recorded in the BP handbook) is&#xD;
      assessed and the global cardiovascular risk score is re-calculated to assess any changes. A&#xD;
      copy of the final assessment is faxed to the participant's primary physician. Participants&#xD;
      are encouraged to follow up with their GP.&#xD;
