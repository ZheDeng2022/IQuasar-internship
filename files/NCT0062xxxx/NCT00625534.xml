      Background: Large acceptance of mesh reinforcement techniques in groin hernia repair lowered&#xD;
      recurrence rates for all techniques. Recurrence rate alone is not the main quality criterion&#xD;
      for hernia repair anymore. Chronic significant post operative pain is a common, clinically&#xD;
      relevant, poorly understood and poorly studied entity which is 3 to 5 times more common than&#xD;
      hernia recurrence. As a subgroup to chronic significant post operative pain or as a separate&#xD;
      entity, sexual dysfunction due to ejaculatory and genital pain after inguinal hernia repair&#xD;
      may happen in approximately 2.5% of patients. Patient's preoperative psychological profile as&#xD;
      well as pain exposure history is showed to be important in the development of chronic&#xD;
      significant post operative pain. The objective of this study is to analyse chronic&#xD;
      significant post operative pain and the functional outcome status of patients after&#xD;
      laparoscopic repair compared to open repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A randomized controlled non-blinded clinical trial is designed to compare open&#xD;
      inguinal hernia mesh repair with laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal repair on chronic&#xD;
      significant post operative pain, pain related sexual function disorders, complications,&#xD;
      health related quality of life outcomes, recurrence rates, and cost. Volunteers will be&#xD;
      recruited in Geneva University Hospital, department of surgery, visceral surgery unit.&#xD;
      Eligibility criteria is male patient aged over 21 years, with reducible inguinal unilateral&#xD;
      or bilateral primary hernia who are candidates for elective surgery and medically fit for&#xD;
      general anesthesia.130 patients will be enrolled for each group to achieve an Î±-Level of 0.05&#xD;
      and a power of 80%. Follow-up will take place at 10th, 30th days as well as 3 12 and 24 post&#xD;
      operative months by questionnaires and by clinical exam by independent expert. An overall&#xD;
      cost-analysis will be realized. Patient enrollment in the study will start in April 2008 and&#xD;
      estimated to end in may 2009.&#xD;

      Hernia repair is the most frequent elective operation performed in general surgery. Chronic&#xD;
      pain or persistent neuralgia has been recognized as a complication after inguinal hernia&#xD;
      repair but was reported in the 1980s as a rare and infrequent condition. Studies from the mid&#xD;
      1990s have reported a higher frequency, with up to 50% of patients reporting pain after&#xD;
      hernia repair more than 1 year after surgery. Chronic pain after hernia repair can be&#xD;
      disabling, with considerable impact on quality of life. The natural history of postoperative&#xD;
      pain, including its prevalence, etiology, duration, associated disability and it's social and&#xD;
      economical impact remain undefined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Cooperative Hernia Study (1996) assessing postoperative pain in a prospective trial&#xD;
      including 315 open non-mesh repair patients with 2 years follow-up found at 1 year, 62.9% of&#xD;
      groin or inguinal pain and 11.9% of patients had moderate to severe pain; 53.6% had pain and&#xD;
      10.6% of patients continued to report moderate to severe pain 2 years postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a prospective consecutive case series study of 500 consecutive operations in 466&#xD;
      unselected adult patients for open groin hernia repair in Denmark (1994-1996), 1 year after&#xD;
      surgery, 19% of patients had some degree of pain, 6% had moderate or severe pain. Pain&#xD;
      restricted daily function 6% of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A cross-sectional cohort study based on the Danish Hernia Database (1998) to determine the&#xD;
      incidence of groin pain 1 year after inguinal hernia repair and to assess the influence of&#xD;
      chronic groin pain on function, detected 28.7% of pain in the groin area and 11.0% of the&#xD;
      patients reported that pain was interfering with work or leisure activity. There were no&#xD;
      difference in the incidence of pain with regard to the different types of hernia, the&#xD;
      different types of surgical repairs, or the different types of anesthesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire survey of a historical cohort of 351 patients who underwent inguinal hernia&#xD;
      surgery in Aberdeen - Scotland (1995-1997) reported 30% chronic pain. Character of this pain&#xD;
      was predominantly neuropathic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Definition of chronic pain The definition of &quot;chronic pain&quot; by the International Association&#xD;
      of the Study of Pain is &quot;pain lasting for 3 months or more&quot;. There is no consensus on neither&#xD;
      in the definition, nor the severity grades of CSPOP in the literature. In the Cooperative&#xD;
      Hernia Study, Cunningham et al. clearly described mild, moderate, and severe pain. Mild pain&#xD;
      was defined as an occasional pain or discomfort that did not limit activity, with a return to&#xD;
      lifestyle before hernia; moderate pain, as pain preventing return to normal preoperative&#xD;
      activities (i.e., inability to continue with activities before hernia such as golf, tennis,&#xD;
      or other sports, and inability to lift objects without pain, that patients had been lifting&#xD;
      before the hernia occurrence); and severe pain, as pain that incapacitated the patient at&#xD;
      frequent intervals or interfered with activities of daily living (i.e., a pain constantly&#xD;
      present, or intermittently present but so severe as to impair normal activities, such as&#xD;
      walking). Other studies defined chronic pain as &quot;that persisting for one year&#xD;
      postoperatively&quot;. One Dutch study defined pain as pain in the groin or scrotum lasting more&#xD;
      than 1 month after surgery. In our study chronic pain is defined as a minimal score &gt; 4 using&#xD;
      the quadruple visual analogue scale (VASQ) 3 months after procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics and etiology of chronic pain Somatic, neuropathic, and visceral chronic pain&#xD;
      syndromes are described. Cunningham et al. reported the somatic pain syndrome as the most&#xD;
      common type of chronic post hernia pain. The pain is localized to common ligamentous&#xD;
      insertion to the pubic tubercle. Somatic pain may be due to the damage to the pubic tubercle&#xD;
      during the stapling of mesh prosthesis or from deep muscle layers. Incorporation of the&#xD;
      periosteum of the pubic tubercle into the most medial suture during open hernia repair is&#xD;
      accused. Neuropathic pain is probably attributable to damage to the ilioinguinal or&#xD;
      genitofemoral nerve. Neuropathic pain usually develops in the sensory distribution of an&#xD;
      injured nerve. Chronic residual neuralgia occurs as a result of surgical handing of sensory&#xD;
      nerves. The nerve trauma can be due to partial or complete division, stretching, contusion,&#xD;
      crushing, electrical damage, or sutures compression. Secondary nerve damage can occur due to&#xD;
      irritation or compression by an adjacent inflammatory process such as granuloma. Neuropathic&#xD;
      pain described as pulling, tugging, tearing, throbbing, stabbing, shooting, numbing, and&#xD;
      dull. The onset of neuropathic pain is often delayed, occurring after a latent period of days&#xD;
      to weeks. Pain is often aggravated by ambulation, stooping or hyperextension of hip and&#xD;
      sexual intercourse; and alleviated by recumbent position and flexion of the hip and thigh. In&#xD;
      laparoscopic hernia repair when stapling the mesh, it can penetrate the wall of the inguinal&#xD;
      canal entrapping and irritating the sensory nerves. Kinking of the nerves may cause chronic&#xD;
      irritation. The third pain syndrome described in the literature is visceral. For example,&#xD;
      pain encountered only on ejaculation due to dysfunction of periurethral structures involved&#xD;
      in ejaculation. One possible mechanism is the injury to either somatic sacral or sympathetic&#xD;
      nerves, resulting in dyssynergia of the ejaculatory effector muscles. It can also be due to&#xD;
      stricture in the spermatic duct from the scar tissue or twisting of the cord.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prognosis of chronic pain Once chronic pain is installed, it does not change without a&#xD;
      radical treatment. Cunningham et al. reported a prevalence of mild, moderate, or severe pain&#xD;
      of 63% at 1 year postoperatively, which was reduced to 54% after 2 years. Those patients who&#xD;
      reported moderate to severe pain at 1 year (12%) continued to report persistent pain at 2&#xD;
      years (11 %).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk of developing chronic pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Predisposing psychological factors Preoperative psychological state of patient&#xD;
           (Depression, dependencies, drug consumption etc.) or history of chronic pain with&#xD;
           previous surgery or accident may be a predicting factor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Surgical factors Recurrent hernia, preoperative pain and absence of visible bulge before&#xD;
           surgery, delayed onset of symptoms after surgery, high pain scores at one week&#xD;
           postoperatively and requirement of four or more weeks before returning to work are&#xD;
           reported as risk factors for developing of chronic pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impact of surgical technique Several different surgical techniques are studied with each&#xD;
      other in the literature and different meta analyses, each with different point of interest,&#xD;
      gives different lectures of the reality. Despite the fact that there is no consensus in the&#xD;
      literature, surgical technique is clearly one of the key parameters. The overall frequency of&#xD;
      chronic pain is higher in studies with specific measurements, where pain is the primary&#xD;
      outcome of interest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  OMR vs. non-mesh repair The hypothetical advantage of tension free repair on chronic&#xD;
           pain issue is not confirmed. Two retrospective cohort studies coming from the tenors of&#xD;
           open mesh repair, reported less chronic pain with mesh repair. This advantage of mesh&#xD;
           repair on pain scores versus conventional no-mesh repairs is not confirmed by randomized&#xD;
           controlled trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  LR vs. OMR The only study comparing laparoscopic totally extraperitoneal (TEP) repair&#xD;
           (Polypropylene mesh without fixation) with classic OMR (Lichtenstein) comes from Kumar&#xD;
           et al. They find overall 30% of &quot;chronic pain and discomfort&quot; (22,5% for LR, 38,3% for&#xD;
           OMR) after a mean of 21 months post hernia repair. Medical Research Council trial&#xD;
           reported a significantly higher incidence of chronic pain after open repair than after&#xD;
           laparoscopic repair (37 % versus 29 %) at 1 year. This trial, however, included non-mesh&#xD;
           repairs in the open group and transabdominal preperitoneal (TAP) and TEP repairs in the&#xD;
           laparoscopic group. In a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials of laparoscopic&#xD;
           and open prosthetic mesh repair of groin hernia, EU Trialists found that chronic pain is&#xD;
           less likely to occur after laparoscopic repair than after open repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  TEP or TAP? The TAP repair is historically the technique of choice in the north america.&#xD;
           Most of the literature compares TAP to another technique. In this technique, flat, heavy&#xD;
           weighted polypropylene meshes were used and fixed with staplers or tackers. Peritoneal&#xD;
           tears were also closed with the same technique. Higher rates of chronic pain were&#xD;
           reported after TAP repair versus TEP repair. Nerve entrapment during these several&#xD;
           stapling procedures was probably the main reason. TAP is also strongly associated to&#xD;
           &quot;rare but serious vascular and visceral complications&quot;. The Medical Research Council&#xD;
           trial reported that all serious complications occurred in patients undergoing the TAP&#xD;
           approach. Most of the postoperative complications as sepsis on bowel fistula with mesh,&#xD;
           mechanical ileus on adherences or port site hernias are seen in TAP repair. In our&#xD;
           practice TEP repair is the technique of choice. Dissection is realized without the use&#xD;
           of balloon dissector, an anatomic, preformed anatomic polyester mesh implanted without&#xD;
           fixation by stapling, tacking or suture.&#xD;
