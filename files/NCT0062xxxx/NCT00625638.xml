  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The goal of this research study is to learn if using an Interactive Voice Response (IVR)&#xD;
      system can bring about better and more timely symptom control for patients with advanced&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system, supplemented by&#xD;
           Nursing Telephone Intervention (NTI), results in better symptom management and quality&#xD;
           of life than standard care for individuals with advanced cancer as evidenced by reduced&#xD;
           scores on symptom measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine whether the IVR system, supplemented by NTI, results in reduced caregiver&#xD;
           burden, increased caregiver satisfaction with care, and improved coping strategies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine the feasibility of using an IVR system, supplemented by NTI, for symptom&#xD;
           assessment in individuals with advanced cancer and their caregivers by conducting a&#xD;
           process evaluation of the system. Variables to be evaluated include rates of participant&#xD;
           recruitment and retention, frequency of use of the system, acceptability of the system&#xD;
           to participants, and barriers to participation. Researchers' goal is to identify and&#xD;
           improve aspects that affect external validity (recruitment rate, cohort maintenance),&#xD;
           internal validity (implementation, contamination), participant acceptability and&#xD;
           satisfaction, and reaction to study procedures. The findings from this evaluation will&#xD;
           also allow researchers to evaluate delivery of interventions in future studies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      If you and your caregiver agree to take part in this study, you will be randomly assigned (as&#xD;
      in the toss of the coin) to be in 1 of 2 groups. Group A will receive standard of care&#xD;
      provided at the palliative center at M. D. Anderson, but will not receive any phone calls&#xD;
      from the Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system. Group B will receive phone calls by the&#xD;
      Interactive Voice Response (IVR) system on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday for 15 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you sign this consent form, you will answer questions about your diagnosis, the&#xD;
      medication that you take, and the symptoms that you are having (for example, pain, fatigue,&#xD;
      anxiety, depression, and overall feeling of well-being). You will either be asked these&#xD;
      questions verbally or you will complete a written questionnaire. This should take about 30&#xD;
      minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you and your caregiver are assigned to Group A, you will continue with the standard of&#xD;
      care provided at the palliative center at M. D. Anderson. On Day 15, both you and your&#xD;
      caregiver will be seen in the outpatient clinic by the research nurse, and complete the same&#xD;
      questionnaire you had at the beginning of the study, either verbally or written. This should&#xD;
      take about 30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you and your caregiver are assigned to Group B, a research nurse will train you and your&#xD;
      caregiver to operate the IVR system. The IVR call will be made to the preferred telephone&#xD;
      number(s) provided by you and your caregiver. The telephone calls will be made 1 time a day&#xD;
      at times chosen by you and your caregiver. You will both be given a 3-digit code number to&#xD;
      enter as a way of confirming who you are.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once you have entered the requested numbers, the IVR system will ask you to answer questions&#xD;
      about pain, fatigue, anxiety, depression, and your overall feeling of well-being. These phone&#xD;
      calls should take about 3-5 minutes to complete. You should complete the phone calls&#xD;
      separately and should not attempt to influence each others answers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A research nurse will review the answer in the IVR system. If you haven't responded to the&#xD;
      IVR questions in 3 days, if you answer that you would like to be contacted by a nurse, or if&#xD;
      a symptom has reached a concerning level, you and your caregiver will receive a phone call&#xD;
      from the nurse. The nurse may ask about symptoms, medications being taken, concerns or doubts&#xD;
      about the medication, and if you have any concerns about your physical or emotional well&#xD;
      being. You will be reminded of the different telephone numbers you can use to receive&#xD;
      assistance 24 hours a day. During the phone call, you will also be asked if you would like&#xD;
      the nurse to contact your caregiver for information and support. If you agree, the nurse will&#xD;
      contact your caregiver.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Day 8, both you and your caregiver will be contacted either in person or by phone by the&#xD;
      research nurse and will complete the same questionnaire you had at the beginning of the&#xD;
      study. On Day 15, both you and your caregiver will be seen in the outpatient clinic by the&#xD;
      research nurse and will complete this same questionnaire again, either verbally or written.&#xD;
      This should take about 30 minutes to complete each time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Your participation on this study will end on Day 15.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Up to 68 patient-caregiver groups (or a total of 136&#xD;
      participants) will take part in this study. All the participants will be enrolled at M. D.&#xD;
      Anderson.&#xD;
