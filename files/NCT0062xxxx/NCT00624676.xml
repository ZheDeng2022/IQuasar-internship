  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acne vulgaris is a frequent inflammatory skin condition involving the pilosebaceous unit and&#xD;
      affecting more than 80% of teenagers. Mild to moderate acne vulgaris is usually treated with&#xD;
      topical agents such as benzoyl peroxide, retinoids and antibiotics. These treatments can be&#xD;
      associated with local tolerance problems and/or antibiotic resistance. Salicylic acid has&#xD;
      been shown to be an effective treatment for acne. LHA is a lipophilic hydroxy acid derivative&#xD;
      of salicylic acid that has comedolytic and antibacterial properties.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this trial was to compare the efficacy and tolerance of a cream formulation&#xD;
      containing 0.3% LHA (LHA formulation) to a 5% benzoyl peroxide gel.&#xD;

      This was a randomized clinical trial performed at two centers (Montreal and Laval, Quebec,&#xD;
      Canada) under the direction of the same principal investigator. Eighty (80) subjects were&#xD;
      enrolled in the study. Subjects were asked to report to the clinic for four visits (D0, D28,&#xD;
      D56, D87). The LHA formulation was applied twice a day (morning and evening) and benzoyl&#xD;
      peroxide was applied daily (evening) on a clean face for a total of 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Efficacy was evaluated at day 28, 56 and 87. The number of papules, pustules, opened and&#xD;
      closed comedones were counted at each visit by a blinded assessor. The overall efficacy was&#xD;
      evaluated with a 4-point scale (no improvement, moderate, good and excellent) by the subject&#xD;
      and the blinded assessor. Clinical examination included evaluation of sensitivity of the skin&#xD;
      (presence of erythema and desquamation) by the investigator and of pruritus, tingling and&#xD;
      burning sensation by subjects on a 4-point scale. Finally, the subject and the skin assessor&#xD;
      both evaluated overall tolerance on a 4-point scale.&#xD;
