      Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a well-known complication of antipsychotic drug therapy in&#xD;
      individuals treated for mental disorders such as schizophrenia. It typically consists of&#xD;
      purposeless, involuntary movements involving the mouth area or the trunk and limb muscles,&#xD;
      occurring within months or years of drug use. The annual incidence of TD in the population&#xD;
      treated with antipsychotic drugs is between 1-5%, but the risk is 5-fold greater in older&#xD;
      individuals. Once triggered, TD is often irreversible and untreatable. Its cause is unknown,&#xD;
      but an imbalance between chaotic mechanisms triggered by the drugs and natural protective&#xD;
      factors fighting against these may provide an explanation. One way to activate this&#xD;
      protective response is to supplement the diet with high doses of essential fatty acids of the&#xD;
      omega-3 class, which constitute a critical component of nerve cell membranes. Using this&#xD;
      strategy, one research team showed a 50% reduction in the severity of TD-like movements in&#xD;
      mice treated with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). We hypothesize that DHA supplements can do the&#xD;
      same in patients living with schizophrenia displaying TD movements. Forty (40) subjects&#xD;
      between 30-75 years of age will be recruited. The participants will be randomized and equally&#xD;
      distributed in two groups to take either DHA capsules (3 grams a day) or matching placebo for&#xD;
      12 weeks, after providing informed consent, and TD will be measured with a magnetic tracker&#xD;
      system and clinical scales. The finding of a beneficial effect with DHA against TD would&#xD;
      improve the quality of life for thousands of patients under long-term antipsychotic drug&#xD;
      treatment.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Tardive dyskinesia (TD) is a well-known complication of antipsychotic drug (APD) therapy in&#xD;
      individuals treated for mental disorders such as schizophrenia. It typically consists of&#xD;
      purposeless, involuntary movements involving the oro-facial area, trunk, and/or limb muscles,&#xD;
      occurring within months or years of APD use. Twisting and protruding movements of the tongue,&#xD;
      lip smacking and puckering, and chewing movements, are often observed. Oral dyskinesia may&#xD;
      cause pain, traumatic lesions, tooth wear, impaired retention of prosthetic devices, chewing&#xD;
      difficulty, dysphagia, speech impairment, as well as social embarrassment. The annual&#xD;
      incidence of TD in the population treated with these drugs is between 1-5%, but the risk in&#xD;
      older individuals is 5-fold greater. The second-generation (&quot;atypical&quot;) APDs have&#xD;
      substantially reduced the short-term risk of TD, but the annual incidence of TD in older&#xD;
      individuals taking these drugs remains comparable to that of younger adults treated with&#xD;
      first-generation APDs. The cause of TD is unknown. Since all APDs are blockers of dopamine D2&#xD;
      receptors in the brain, researchers hypothesized that these receptors (or their signaling&#xD;
      pathways) become supersensitive in such a way to promote TD. APDs also modulate the&#xD;
      expression of a number of brain factors belonging to the nuclear receptor family, including&#xD;
      Retinoid X Receptors (RXR) and Nur77, which are overexpressed following chronic APD&#xD;
      treatment. These factors, seemingly mounting an adaptive response to fend off adverse drug&#xD;
      reactions such as TD, may become incompetent or insufficient over time in those individuals&#xD;
      developing TD. One way to activate this response is to supplement the diet with high doses of&#xD;
      essential fatty acids of the omega-3 class, which constitute a critical component of nerve&#xD;
      cell membranes and modulate a variety of brain receptors. Once triggered, TD is often&#xD;
      irreversible and untreatable. However, one team recently showed a 50% reduction in the&#xD;
      severity of TD-like movements in mice treated with docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since there is an apparent close relationship between retinoid receptors and dopamine systems&#xD;
      in the human brain and DHA is a RXR agonist, our working hypothesis is that DHA will reduce&#xD;
      TD intensity in patients living with schizophrenia by increasing the transcriptional activity&#xD;
      along these pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the clinical impact of DHA on the intensity of TD in humans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design&#xD;
&#xD;
      Forty (40) subjects between 30-75 years of age will be recruited. The participants will be&#xD;
      randomized and equally distributed in parallel groups to take either DHA (3 grams a day) or&#xD;
      matching placebo capsules for 12 weeks, after providing informed consent. The study will use&#xD;
      questionnaires, venous blood sampling, as well as clinical scales, to monitor the psychiatric&#xD;
      condition, the lipid profile, and TD intensity at the beginning and end of the study. Brief&#xD;
      and simple tasks will also be completed with a motion analysis system using magnetic sensors&#xD;
      in order to measure body movements and TD with accuracy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The finding of a beneficial effect with DHA against TD would improve the quality of life for&#xD;
      thousands of patients under long-term APD treatment.&#xD;
