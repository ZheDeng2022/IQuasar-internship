      Developing a method to maximize maternal expulsive effort should be of great value in&#xD;
      reducing the number of cesarean section or instrumental deliveries. Various investigations&#xD;
      have shown that use of an occlusal support device (OSD) increases the isometric strength of&#xD;
      different muscle groups. The aim of our study was to investigate the role of an OSD in second&#xD;
      stage pushing.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The increased use of epidural anesthesia during labor has lead to an increased incidence of&#xD;
      prolonged second stage as an indication for cesarean section or instrumental delivery. The&#xD;
      use of oxytocin has proven to be an effective method of augmentation of labor in such&#xD;
      prolonged labor cases. However, despite oxytocin augmentation, there has been an increase in&#xD;
      the number of cases that require cesarean section or instrumental delivery to effect&#xD;
      delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      McRobert's maneuver, which is often used in to relieve shoulder dystocia, has recently been&#xD;
      shown to increase intrauterine pressure approximately two-fold. However; it is an arduous&#xD;
      position for the pregnant woman to maintain over a long period of time. Developing&#xD;
      alternative methods to maximize expulsive forces, both uterine contractions and maternal&#xD;
      expulsive effort, may be of great value in reducing the number of cesarean sections or&#xD;
      instrumental deliveries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Various researchers have investigated the effect of an occlusal support device (OSD) on the&#xD;
      isometric strength of different muscle groups, e.g., neck, back, and extremities. The natural&#xD;
      condition of dental occlusion, also known as the index of physical performance, has an affect&#xD;
      on both muscle strength and body balance. When occlusal support is given to edentulous&#xD;
      individuals they show improved physical exercise ability after the re-establishment of&#xD;
      mandibular support. Patients whose dentition is in proper occlusion demonstrate greater&#xD;
      endurance of isometric muscle strength than those who are in malocclusion. We hypothesize&#xD;
      that optimization of dental occlusion by an OSD may improve muscle strength, leading to&#xD;
      increased intrauterine pressure during the second stage in labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of our study is to investigate whether the use of the OSD results in a shortened&#xD;
      duration of the second stage of labor.&#xD;
