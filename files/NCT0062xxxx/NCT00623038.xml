      It is of importance to predict the risk to develop problems after birth. Virginia Apgar&#xD;
      developed a score more than 50 years ago that allows a description of the condition of&#xD;
      newborns at 1, 5 and 10 minutes after birth. The Apgar score is used for every newborn,&#xD;
      however, its applicability is restricted in preterm infants and resuscitated newborns. Thus,&#xD;
      two scores have been suggested recently - the Specified Apgar and the Expanded-Apgar score.&#xD;
      By combining both scores the Combined-Apgar has been developed as a new delivery room tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether the Combined-Apgar predicts poor outcome&#xD;
      better than the Specified- or Expanded Apgar alone.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the conventional Apgar score has its limitations in preterm or resuscitated infants,&#xD;
      specifications of the individual items of the original Apgar score were suggested (Specified&#xD;
      Apgar). The Specified-Apgar will slightly change the Apgars' perspective, but will not alter&#xD;
      the number of its components. The advantage of the proposed definitions is the applicability&#xD;
      in all infants, regardless of resuscitative efforts or gestational age. However, neither the&#xD;
      conventional nor the Specified-Apgar score describes the condition of the infant. That&#xD;
      problem has been taken up by the American Academy of pediatrics (AAP)and the American College&#xD;
      of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). They suggested to use an expanded Apgar Score&#xD;
      reporting form (Expanded-Apgar)that accounts for concurrent resuscitative interventions.&#xD;
      Whereas the Specified-Apgar score describes the condition of the infant, the Expanded-Apgar&#xD;
      is a measure of interventions needed to achieve this condition. By combining both scores&#xD;
      (Combined-Apgar) the postnatal condition is described in more detail than by a single score&#xD;
      alone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To validate the accuracy of these scores in a population of very preterm infants, the present&#xD;
      prospective, observational, international multicenter study is planned. Until today there is&#xD;
      no gold standard available to describe infant's conditions and interventions. For the&#xD;
      evaluation of the scores it was therefore hypothesized that the Combined Apgar predicts poor&#xD;
      outcome (defined as either death or any major morbidity) better than the Specified Apgar or&#xD;
      Expanded Apgar alone. Prediction of poor outcome was used as a surrogate parameter to test&#xD;
      the predictive value of the Combined-Apgar score in a clinical setting for preterm infants.&#xD;
      In an attempt to determine how strong of an association there is between the Combined Apgar&#xD;
      Score and neurologic impairment in early childhood, we are presently engaged in a long-term&#xD;
      follow-up of all surviving infants at a corrected age of 24 months.&#xD;
