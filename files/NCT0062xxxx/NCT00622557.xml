      A database has been established to track the outcomes of all cases performed in the&#xD;
      University Hospitals Department of Surgery in an effort to improve quality of surgical&#xD;
      performance and case management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, the purpose of the database will be used as a quality improvement tool for&#xD;
      analyzing process and outcome measures and to accurately track cases performed by surgeons.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Since the Institute of Medicine report, titled &quot;To Err is Human&quot;, there has been an&#xD;
      increasing trend to evaluate outcomes in healthcare. While optimal outcomes in delivery of&#xD;
      healthcare are something that hospitals and their medical, nursing and administrative staff&#xD;
      have always tried to achieve, this has often been attempted without having much information&#xD;
      to assess the outcomes that actually occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, programs such as NSQIP (the National Surgical Quality Improvement Project)&#xD;
      have been brought from the VA system into private and academic healthcare systems, to sample&#xD;
      surgical outcomes and provide hospitals with benchmarks that can be achieved, as well as&#xD;
      informing them where they rank in the overall results. Unfortunately, systems such as NSQIP&#xD;
      are based on sampling a percentage of cases performed each week, but do not track all cases&#xD;
      or all providers. Many cases are therefore not tracked in any way.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Certain centers have now established databases to track their own surgical outcomes. These&#xD;
      are usually specific to certain surgical specialties, and provide an opportunity to perform&#xD;
      quality improvement. These also have the added value of being useful tools for maintenance of&#xD;
      certification and for clinical research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary goals of this study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      We propose to further develop the General Surgical Outcomes Quality Improvement&#xD;
      Database(GSOD)-subsequently renamed UH-SOCRATES-which will track all surgical, medical, and&#xD;
      radiological encounters occurring at University Hospitals Case Medical Center(UHCMC)as well&#xD;
      as at UH's Richmond and Geauga campuses. This database will have several goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. UH-SOCRATES will be used as a quality improvement tool for analyzing process and outcome&#xD;
           measures, for example being able to evaluate patients with prolonged length of stay so&#xD;
           that cases can be defined and evaluated for specific risk factors or in-hospital events.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. By using hospital coded CPT codes, UH-SOCRATES will be able to accurately track cases&#xD;
           performed by surgeons for maintenance of certification purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All of these goals are related to quality improvement and assessment, and are considered &quot;not&#xD;
      human subjects research&quot; under 45 CFR 46. In the future it is hoped that UH-SOCRATES will&#xD;
      also be a powerful resource for formal research into surgical outcomes. Future IRB&#xD;
      submissions will be submitted for this purpose. This IRB submission therefore only addresses&#xD;
      the quality improvement perspective of the UH-SOCRATES.&#xD;
