  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aim of this proposal is to present a novel, multimodal treatment strategy for&#xD;
      increasing lean body mass in individuals with cancer who experience cachexia between baseline&#xD;
      and day 29 (+/- 3 days). The strategy includes graded resistance training and aerobic&#xD;
      exercise, targeted nutrient supplementation and pharmacologic intervention (melatonin).&#xD;
&#xD;
      We postulate that this strategy, together with the simultaneous management of symptoms that&#xD;
      decrease appetite (e.g. depression, pain, and nausea), will also accomplish our secondary&#xD;
      objectives of improving clinical outcomes such as strength and function between baseline and&#xD;
      day 29 (+/- 3 days).&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Melatonin is a hormone that helps reduce inflammation and poor food absorption caused by&#xD;
      cancer. It may also enhance the effects of ibuprofen.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Juven is a nutritional supplement that is designed to help build muscle and slow muscle&#xD;
      breakdown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening Tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you can start treatment on this study, you will have &quot;screening tests&quot; to help the&#xD;
      doctor decide if you are eligible to take part in this study. The following tests will be&#xD;
      performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (1 to 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests. This routine blood draw will&#xD;
           include a pregnancy test for women who are able to have children. To be eligible to take&#xD;
           part in this study, the pregnancy test must be negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Additional blood (1 tablespoon) will be drawn to check your thyroid function and the&#xD;
           levels of two B vitamins, if these have not been checked within the past 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including measurement of vital signs (blood pressure,&#xD;
           heart rate, temperature, and breathing rate).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have an electrocardiogram (ECG -- a test that measures the electrical activity&#xD;
           of the heart).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your resting energy expenditure (energy used at rest) will be measured. with a&#xD;
           calorie-measuring device. For this test, you will breathe in and out through your mouth&#xD;
           for about 10 minutes to allow a calorie-measuring device to measure the oxygen your body&#xD;
           uses, and from this it calculates how much energy your body uses at rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked to fill out a questionnaire to rate your overall physical well-being,&#xD;
           another questionnaire to rate your level of fatigue, and a third questionnaire to rate&#xD;
           your experiences with 10 common symptoms in the past 24 hours (pain, fatigue, nausea,&#xD;
           depression, anxiety, drowsiness, shortness of breath, changes in appetite, sleep&#xD;
           difficulty, and feeling of well being). In total, these questionnaires will take about&#xD;
           30 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will complete a diary entry that lists all of the food and drinks you have had in&#xD;
           the last 3 days. It should take about 10 minutes to complete.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your strength and stamina will be evaluated. This is measured by hand-grip and pinch&#xD;
           strength tests that are done with both hands. These tests will see how hard you can grip&#xD;
           a device with your hand and pinch the pads of another device called a pinch gauge. These&#xD;
           tests will be done 3 times and your best scores will be used. Your strength and stamina&#xD;
           will also be checked using the Get-Up-and-Go test and the 6-minute walk test. The&#xD;
           Get-Up-and-Go test measures how long it takes to get up from sitting in a chair that has&#xD;
           arms, walking 10 feet, turning around and walking back to the chair, and sitting down.&#xD;
           The 6-minute walk test will measure the distance you can walk in 6 minutes on a 100-foot&#xD;
           loop. You will walk 50 feet and then turn and walk back to the beginning. You will do&#xD;
           this at a walking speed that feels comfortable and for as many times as you can in 6&#xD;
           minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (1 to 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for markers of inflammation and&#xD;
           nutrition status.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will take one (1) 20mg capsule of melatonin every night. It can be taken with or without&#xD;
      food. It should be taken with 8 ounces (1 cup) of water.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will drink 90 calories of Juven, twice a day. Juven is a powder supplement that is mixed&#xD;
      into 8 ounces of water. It is available in orange or grape flavors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will also be instructed to increase your daily calorie intake by at least 1,000 calories.&#xD;
      To assist you in doing so, dietary advice will be given to you by a nurse or physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exercise Training:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will complete 2 exercise training sessions a week. The sessions will combine resistance&#xD;
      and graded aerobic training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Resistance training (with Thera-bands) is designed to increase the muscle-building effects of&#xD;
      a hormone called testosterone. Thera-bands are rubber bands that you can hold or put around&#xD;
      your feet to provide resistance to your muscles when you bend and flex your arms and legs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be instructed in how to do 3 upper-body exercises (chest press, shoulder press, and&#xD;
      arm pull down) and 3 lower-body exercises (leg press, leg extension, and leg flexion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      At your first visit, a physician will educate you to make sure that all exercises are done&#xD;
      correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each repetition will take 12 seconds to complete (6 seconds to bend, then 6 seconds to&#xD;
      straighten your arm or leg). When 6 repetitions are completed, the next week's set will be&#xD;
      increased by 1 repetition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graded aerobic exercise is a walking/running program that may help you exercise longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Graded aerobic exercise involves walking or running for 3-4 minutes at 70-80% of your maximum&#xD;
      predicted heart rate. There will be a 3-minute warm-up and a 3-minute cool-down before and&#xD;
      after this exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During your first visit, you will be shown how to monitor your heart rate and how to exercise&#xD;
      at 70-80% of your maximum heart rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will add 1 minute to your aerobic exercise at the start of each week.&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will receive your own customized aerobic and resistance exercise program based on your&#xD;
      range of motion and risk for falls, which will be evaluated by the study staff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you experience chest pain, have a temperature over 100.4 Â°F, have a platelet count of&#xD;
      lower than a certain level, have fresh bruises, or shortness of breath at rest, you will be&#xD;
      advised to stop exercising until these are relieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Evaluations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      While on study, within 3 days of the days listed below, the following measurements will be&#xD;
      monitored:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your lean body mass and weight will be checked at Days 15 and 29 using the Tanita&#xD;
           TBF-310 body composition analyzer/scale. For measurements with the Tanita TBF 310, you&#xD;
           will be asked to wear light clothes and to take off your shoes and socks when being&#xD;
           weighed. You will stand on a special scale that will send an extremely low-energy,&#xD;
           high-frequency electrical signal from one foot to your other foot. You should not be&#xD;
           able to feel this at all.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your muscle mass (mid-arm muscle area) will be measured with a special tape.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The thickness of a skin fold on your triceps (back of your upper arm) will be measured 3&#xD;
           times using skin fold calipers. Calipers are a gentle clamp-like device that is used on&#xD;
           the outside of your body to measure skin thickness.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  At Day 29, your resting energy expenditure will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Days 15 and 29 of the study cycle, you will complete the same 3 questionnaires as at&#xD;
           screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your caloric intake will be measured on Days 15 and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Your strength and stamina will be evaluated on Days 15 and 29.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  On Day 29, blood (1 to 2 tablespoons) will be drawn to check for markers of inflammation&#xD;
           and nutrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 1 to 2 tablespoons) will be drawn for routine tests every 15 days while you&#xD;
           are on-study. You will also have a fecal occult blood test at this time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You will be on study for 29 days (1 cycle).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Melatonin and Juven are commercially available nutritional&#xD;
      supplements and are exempt from FDA approval. However, in patients with cancer and cachexia,&#xD;
      the study treatment (resistance training, aerobic exercise, and the use of Juven, and&#xD;
      melatonin) is considered experimental. At this time, it is only being used in research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 patients will be enrolled on this study. Up to 30 patients will be enrolled at M.D.&#xD;
      Anderson, and 10 will be enrolled at the University of Alabama-Birmingham.&#xD;
