      Patients who are suffering from a stroke often present to the hospital with elevated blood&#xD;
      pressure. Elevated blood pressure in the setting of stroke increases the risk of brain&#xD;
      swelling or bleeding into the brain. Even so, there has been concern about lowering the blood&#xD;
      pressure with medications because the newly injured parts of the brain may not get the blood&#xD;
      flow they need, thereby worsening the damage from the initial stroke. We hope to demonstrate&#xD;
      that the drug valsartan can be used safely and modestly to lower blood pressure in acute&#xD;
      stroke patients, without having a detrimental effect on brain blood flow or neurologic&#xD;
      status. Novel MRI techniques to measure brain blood flow will be used in conjunction with&#xD;
      clinical scales to demonstrate safety.&#xD;

      Hypertension is an important modifiable risk factor for the prevention of ischemic stroke.&#xD;
      Whether specific antihypertensive medications confer an added benefit for recurrent stroke&#xD;
      reduction beyond their ability to lower blood pressure remains a controversial subject.&#xD;
      Because of their varied mechanisms of action, and their potential role as neuroprotective&#xD;
      agents, there has been particular interest in drugs that affect the&#xD;
      renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Several large multi-national randomized clinical&#xD;
      trials have suggested a unique benefit of these agents, namely angiotensin converting enzyme&#xD;
      (ACE) inhibitors and ARBs, for the prevention of vascular events. Even with the very modest&#xD;
      reductions in blood pressure achieved in the HOPE trial, ramipril was found to have a&#xD;
      significant benefit on recurrent stroke prevention (Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation&#xD;
      Study Investigators, 2000). In the LIFE study, losartan was shown to be more efficacious for&#xD;
      the prevention of recurrent strokes in hypertensive patients than atenolol, despite nearly&#xD;
      identical reductions in blood pressure (Dahl√∂f et al, 2002). This is an area of some debate,&#xD;
      however, as some data may support the lowering of blood pressure in general over the use of&#xD;
      specific agents such as ACE inhibitors for the prevention of recurrent stroke (PROGRESS&#xD;
      Collaborative Group, 2001). More recently, the ACCESS study showed a benefit of early&#xD;
      treatment with candesartan cilexetil on 12-month mortality and the number of vascular events&#xD;
      in patients who had suffered an acute stroke (Schrader et al, 2003). The mechanisms that&#xD;
      underlie this are uncertain, but the study suggests that early treatment of blood pressure in&#xD;
      acute stroke may have long-term benefits, presumably independent of hemodynamic factors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of antihypertensives in the setting of an acute infarct is an area of great interest.&#xD;
      A transient rise in blood pressure is frequently seen in acute stroke patients (Semplicini et&#xD;
      al, 2003). Although blood pressure typically normalizes within one week without treatment,&#xD;
      about one-third of patients remain hypertensive (Britton et al, 1986; Harper et al, 1994).&#xD;
      Currently, there is insufficient data for a clear recommendation on deliberately altering&#xD;
      blood pressure in these acute ischemic stroke patients (BASC, 2004). That being said,&#xD;
      hypertension in acute stroke has been associated with poor outcome (Warlow et al, 1996),&#xD;
      although the relationship may be a 'J'-shaped curve, with both low and high mean blood&#xD;
      pressures being detrimental (Leonardi-Bee et al, 2002). The potential mechanisms that&#xD;
      underlie the association between hypertension and poor outcome in acute stroke are several,&#xD;
      but may include an increase in peri-infarct edema and an increased risk of hemorrhagic&#xD;
      transformation. The potential benefits of the early treatment of high blood pressure in acute&#xD;
      stroke must be weighed against the theoretical risk of worsening ischemia in compromised&#xD;
      neural tissue. The INWEST trial showed increased mortality in patients actively treated with&#xD;
      a calcium-channel blocker within 72 hours of an acute stroke (Wahlgren et al, 1994), an&#xD;
      effect that may be related to the lowering of diastolic blood pressure (Ahmed et al, 2000).&#xD;
      This data is in keeping with the long-standing hypothesis that impaired autoregulation in the&#xD;
      ischemic brain tissue renders cerebral blood flow purely pressure-dependent. A decrease in&#xD;
      systemic blood pressure would then translate to decreased local perfusion to vulnerable&#xD;
      tissue in the ischemic penumbra. It is in this setting that drugs that modulate the RAAS may&#xD;
      have a unique role. In recent years, animal and human data has accrued that suggests CBF is&#xD;
      maintained with these agents, even in the face of decreased systemic blood pressure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are human data regarding cerebral blood flow and drugs that affect the RAAS, in both&#xD;
      normal patients and those with recent ischemia. Studies with ACE inhibitors have demonstrated&#xD;
      a moderate lowering of blood pressure in hypertensive patients, without a corresponding&#xD;
      decrease in CBP, as measure with xenon CT (Minematsu et al, 1987; Waldemar et al, 1990).&#xD;
      Dyker et al (1997) used Doppler ultrasound to show that cerebral blood flow is maintained in&#xD;
      the setting of acute stroke when systemic blood pressure is lowered with perindopril. A&#xD;
      similar result was seen in hypertensive stroke patients with moderate to severe internal&#xD;
      carotid artery stenosis or occlusion (Walters et al, 2001). When losartan was introduced in&#xD;
      hypertensive patients within 2-7 days of a mild ischemic stroke, there was no adverse effect&#xD;
      on global or region cerebral blood flow, as measured by carotid Doppler and brain&#xD;
      hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime single photon emission computed tomography (HMPAO SPECT; Nazir&#xD;
      et al, 2004). There is no published data on the effects of these drugs on cerebral perfusion&#xD;
      as measured with MRI, nor on changes in infarct volume as measure by DWI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brain imaging with MRI is available at all major centers that admit patients for the care of&#xD;
      ischemic stroke. Diffusion-weighted imaging is considered the 'gold standard' for the&#xD;
      detection of ischemia in the acute setting, with restricted diffusion being visible within 30&#xD;
      minutes of symptom onset (Fisher and Albers, 1999). Semi-quantitative measures of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow can be obtained with perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI) with only a minimal increase&#xD;
      in the total scanning time. The acquisition of perfusion data with MRI is more readily&#xD;
      available than such modalities as PET, SPECT, or xenon CT. Data is ongoing to identify&#xD;
      analysis regimens for PWI that best represent true cerebral perfusion. We will use these&#xD;
      techniques to assess brain perfusion before and after the lowering of blood pressure with&#xD;
      valsartan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We hope to show that valsartan can be used safely in the setting of acute stroke to lower&#xD;
      elevated blood pressure. There are novel properties of this class of drug (an&#xD;
      angiotensive-receptor blocker or ARB), and promising human and animal data, that would&#xD;
      suggest this drug can be safely used to lower blood pressure in the setting of acute stroke&#xD;
      without compromising brain blood flow (i.e. cerebral perfusion). If this is proved to be the&#xD;
      case, this compound could potentially be used routinely in this setting, with the hope of&#xD;
      improving outcome. This pilot study may pave the way for a larger randomized trial looking at&#xD;
      outcome measures in stroke patients. Further, a positive result in the this pilot study will&#xD;
      serve as proof of concept that ARBs maintain cerebral perfusion while decreasing blood&#xD;
      pressure, an overall favorable property.&#xD;
