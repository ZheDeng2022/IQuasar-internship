      1. To assess the effect of RG1068 at a dose of 0.2 mcg/kg intravenously (IV) on the&#xD;
           diameter of the pancreatic duct when used during Magnetic Resonance Pancreatography&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To demonstrate that RG1068-enhanced MRCP improves detection and characterization of&#xD;
           intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasms (IPMN) relative to unenhanced MRCP in patients&#xD;
           with suspected IPMN&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To correlate findings on MRCP with histologically confirmed malignancy&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Until relatively recently, endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) was the&#xD;
      primary diagnostic and therapeutic modality for assessing patients with suspected pancreatic&#xD;
      disease or abnormalities. However, this invasive procedure carries with it a significant&#xD;
      potential for complications including acute pancreatitis, hemorrhage and infection, as well&#xD;
      as reactions to contrast material or premedications and exposure to radiation. In addition,&#xD;
      the success of such procedures, both from the standpoint of safety and efficacy, is highly&#xD;
      dependent on the skill of the endoscopist, and the cost of ERCP is relatively high.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advent of magnetic resonance imaging has resulted in the development of a less expensive,&#xD;
      non-invasive, radiation-free means of assessing the pancreaticobiliary system: Magnetic&#xD;
      Resonance Cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). MRCP uses stationary water in biliary and&#xD;
      pancreatic secretions as an intrinsic contrast medium, thus facilitating examination of&#xD;
      pancreatic and biliary ducts and surrounding tissue. Secretin, which promotes the secretion&#xD;
      of pancreatic fluid into the pancreatic ducts, can thereby enhance the MR imaging signal,&#xD;
      improving delineation of both normal and abnormal structures, as well as highlighting&#xD;
      abnormal fluid collections and leakage. Conversely, filling defects can indicate the presence&#xD;
      of stones or mass lesions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is being undertaken to prospectively assess the effectiveness of RG1068-enhanced&#xD;
      MRCP relative to unenhanced MRCP for the evaluation of patients with known or suspected IPMN.&#xD;
      RG1068 is a synthetic human secretin with a pharmacological profile very similar to that of&#xD;
      biological and synthetic porcine secretins. Secretin is a 27-amino acid gastrointestinal&#xD;
      peptide hormone that is produced by S-cells in the duodenum in response to the pH decrease&#xD;
      caused by the passage of partially digested food from the stomach into the intestine. RG1068&#xD;
      is identical in amino acid sequence to naturally occurring human secretin and differs from&#xD;
      porcine secretin in 2 amino acids.&#xD;
