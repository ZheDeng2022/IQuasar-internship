      This project will evaluate the feasibility of using a fully implanted gluteal stimulation&#xD;
      system for the prevention of Pressure ulcers. The specific goal of this study will be a pilot&#xD;
      clinical trial of veterans with reduced mobility in order to establish clinical efficacy of a&#xD;
      2-channel bilateral gluteal stimulation system. A two-arm crossover study of wheelchair users&#xD;
      with complete SCI will be carried out. All study participants will receive a fully implanted&#xD;
      system incorporating implanted IM electrodes and a Micropulse I IPG stimulator (NDI Medical).&#xD;
      Group assignments will be determined at enrollment using a modified randomization scheme. A&#xD;
      total of 10 subjects will be recruited to the pilot clinical trial.&#xD;

      Within the scope of the study the aims will be to: (1. Develop the pre-implantation&#xD;
      assessment protocol utilizing targeted CT to locate optimal gluteal motor points&#xD;
      bilaterally.) CT assessment of the pelvic region in spinal cord injured subjects will be&#xD;
      carried out to determine regional vascular and nervous anatomy. This will allow us to achieve&#xD;
      optimal electrode placement using a minimally invasive implantation procedure. (2. Develop&#xD;
      the implanted gluteal stimulation system.) The fully implanted gluteal stimulation (GSTIM)&#xD;
      system is envisioned as a marriage between the established technology of the implanted IM&#xD;
      electrodes developed by the Cleveland FES Center and the newly developed Micropulse I&#xD;
      2-channel stimulator. The Micropulse I IPG is a small, rechargeable stimulator developed by&#xD;
      NDI Medical as a platform technology for neuromodulation and neurostimulation applications.&#xD;
      The device will be customized in order to provide two synchronized channels of stimulation&#xD;
      for the GSTIM system. (3. Implement and evaluate implanted gluteal stimulation system in&#xD;
      human volunteers.) A pilot clinical trial of the fully implanted gluteal stimulation system&#xD;
      will be carried out using a two-arm crossover study of ten wheelchair users at risk for&#xD;
      pressure ulcer development due to impaired mobility. Pre-defined selection criteria will be&#xD;
      employed to screen potential participants physically and psychologically. All participants&#xD;
      will receive a stimulation system consisting of implanted IM electrodes inserted bilaterally&#xD;
      in the gluteus maximus together with the Micropulse I stimulator implanted subcutaneously in&#xD;
      the lower abdomen. Tissue health will be assessed at three month intervals during the&#xD;
      12-month period following implantation. The clinical application of this system is of great&#xD;
      relevance to the veteran population at risk of pressure ulcer development. The project will&#xD;
      add value to the continued improvement in health care provision for veterans, allowing them&#xD;
      to benefit from the most recent advances in medical device technology. Although the initial&#xD;
      target user group is veterans with SCI, the proposes system will have applications to other&#xD;
      patient populations at risk due to reduced mobility, such as those with multiple sclerosis&#xD;
      and the elderly.&#xD;
