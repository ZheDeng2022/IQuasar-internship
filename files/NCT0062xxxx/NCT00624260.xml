  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The risk of recurrence in stage III and IV of colorectal cancers (CRC) is high during the&#xD;
      three years following the tumoral resection with curative aim. Therefore, a prolonged&#xD;
      follow-up and an intense monitoring are recommended to detect these recurrences precociously.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, current consensual morphological and biological examinations are not very&#xD;
      contributory, of difficult interpretation and expensive. The metabolic imagery in&#xD;
      tomoscintigraphy by emission of positron coupled with the scanner, called PET-TDM, allows to&#xD;
      identify more specifically recurrences, analyzes the whole body, detects hepatic metastasis&#xD;
      more precociously and give some benefice for early diagnosis of lymph nodes recurrence. The&#xD;
      principle purpose of this study is to evaluate if the systematic follow-up per PET-TDM allows&#xD;
      detecting more often recurrences accessible to a curative surgery. We make the hypothesis&#xD;
      that the systematic practice of PET- tomodensitometry (TDM) during the follow-up of CRC&#xD;
      allows to decrease non curative recurrences appearance during the 3 years follow-up after a&#xD;
      curative surgery.&#xD;

      Patients will be randomized in two groups: one (PET-TDM group) including a semi-annual&#xD;
      systematic PET-TDM during usual follow-up (M6, M12, M18, M24, M30 and M36 after initial&#xD;
      surgery) and the second (control group) in which one PET-TDM will be realized only for&#xD;
      current indication (high isolated markers or before a metastasis curative resection) during&#xD;
      usual follow-up. Will be included patients with a high risk of recurrence of a colorectal&#xD;
      tumor N+ or M+ completely removed (R0 or R1) or tumor stage 4, no regional lymph node&#xD;
      metastasis, no distant metastasis (T4N0M0) operated in emergency (tumoral perforation).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be followed-up during 3 years since the date of initial surgery. Conventional&#xD;
      follow-up will be performed by consensual recommendations for all the patients. In the case&#xD;
      of detecting a recurrence, the adapted treatment (surgery or chemotherapy or both) with&#xD;
      curative aim will be implemented and the follow-up will be carried out in its term or death.&#xD;
      In the case of non curable recurrence, the follow-up will be carried out in its term or&#xD;
      death, and the PET-TDM will not be realised any more.&#xD;
