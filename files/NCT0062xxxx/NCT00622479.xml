      The purpose of this study is to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To elucidate the mechanism involved in the sorafenib-induced hypophosphatemia and&#xD;
           possible early effect of hypophosphatemia on bone mineral density&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. A secondary objective to assess the effect sorafenib treatment on evaluate left&#xD;
           ventricular function (LVEF) and Beta-type natriuretic peptide in plasma.&#xD;
