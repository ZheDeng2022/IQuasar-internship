      RATIONALE: Radiation therapy uses high-energy x-rays to kill tumor cells. Giving high-dose&#xD;
      radiation therapy after surgery may kill any tumor cells that remain after surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This phase II trial is studying radiation therapy to see how well it works in&#xD;
      treating patients who have undergone surgery for newly diagnosed grade II or grade III&#xD;
      meningioma.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the impact of high-dose radiotherapy (RT) on progression-free survival (PFS),&#xD;
           treatment tolerance, and post-treatment global cognitive functioning in patients with&#xD;
           atypical (WHO grade II) or malignant ( WHO grade III) meningioma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients with grade II disease are stratified according to resection status&#xD;
      (complete excision [Simpson's stages 1-3] vs incomplete excision [Simpson's stages 4-5]) and&#xD;
      participate in a phase II study. These patients are assigned to 1 of 2 treatment groups&#xD;
      according to Simpson staging. Only data from these patients is analyzed with respect to the&#xD;
      progression-free survival endpoint. Patients with grade III disease are treated in group 1 or&#xD;
      2 according to Simpson staging (as patients with grade II disease). After treatment, the&#xD;
      clinical results from these patients are observed and described.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 1 (Simpson stage 1-3): Beginning no later than 6 weeks following surgery, patients&#xD;
           undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 6 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group 2 (Simpson stage 4-5): Beginning no later than 6 weeks following surgery, patients&#xD;
           undergo radiotherapy once daily, 5 days a week for 7 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete a Mini-Mental Status Exam at baseline and at 6 weeks and 6 months after&#xD;
      completion of study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 6 weeks, at 6 and 12 months,&#xD;
      and then annually for at least 3 years.&#xD;
