      Primary objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to characterize the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic profile after intravenous&#xD;
           bolus injection of unfractionated heparin (UFH) after repeated sc 100 IU anti-Xa/kg&#xD;
           (corresponding to 1 mg/kg) twice a day during 2.5 days (every 12±2hrs) administrations&#xD;
           of enoxaparin in Caucasian healthy subjects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objective(s):&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the pharmacokinetic and the pharmacodynamic profile between 3 different&#xD;
           timing of administration of the UFH&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the tolerability of the different anticoagulation protocols&#xD;
