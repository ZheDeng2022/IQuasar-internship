      This will be an observational study where parents/ guardians of children in receipt of their&#xD;
      preschool booster will be approached for their child(ren) to take part. Following written&#xD;
      informed consent the Vaccine Research Nurse will explain the purpose of the study and what&#xD;
      would be involved. Participation will involve completion of a health diary for the week&#xD;
      following vaccination to document how their child has been both in terms of local reactions&#xD;
      and systemic symptoms as well as any visits to a doctor (GP or hospital). The nurse will&#xD;
      telephone the family at 48-72 hours following vaccination to see how the child has been.&#xD;
      Information about the vaccine given in the current campaign and vaccines administered in the&#xD;
      infant schedule including date of administration, product and batch number will be recorded&#xD;
      where available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should any large local reactions be reported the nurse may visit the child to take a&#xD;
      photograph to document and illustrate these - photographs will be taken without the child's&#xD;
      face visible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be recruited in two centres - Hertfordshire and Gloucestershire. Recruitment&#xD;
      will start as soon as the necessary approvals are in place. Monthly reports of observed data&#xD;
      will be submitted to the MHRA though the formal analysis will not be conducted until the end&#xD;
      of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment figures and the incidence of ESLs will be reviewed on a six-monthly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At this point it is difficult to predict parental attitude to taking part, though from&#xD;
      experience with recruitment in previous studies it is hoped this will be positive, so&#xD;
      affording a large number of participants.&#xD;

      Medicines, including vaccines, are monitored by the Medicines and Healthcare Regulatory&#xD;
      Agency (MHRA) using what is commonly known as the &quot;yellow card system&quot; where patients or&#xD;
      healthcare professionals may submit notifications. This involves reporting any untoward&#xD;
      medical event that it is suspected may be related to administration of the given medicine.&#xD;
      Through this system concern has been raised about large local reactions, particularly&#xD;
      extensive limb swelling (ESL) which is usually defined as an area more than or equal to 50mm,&#xD;
      in young children in receipt of their pre-school booster. The preschool booster vaccine&#xD;
      contains diphtheria (D), tetanus (T), pertussis (P) and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). Most&#xD;
      of the children about whom these yellow card safety reports have been submitted would have&#xD;
      been primed with whole cell pertussis (wP) containing vaccines in infancy. In some cases&#xD;
      reports have noted blistering and cellulitis in the vaccinated limb with antibiotic treatment&#xD;
      prescribed. There is a recognised risk of ESL in a small proportion of children, 2-13%,&#xD;
      following administration of a fourth or fifth dose of acellular-pertussis containing vaccine.&#xD;
      In previous studies these local reactions fully resolved without treatment within a few days.&#xD;
      Acellular pertussis (aP) containing vaccine has been used exclusively in the routine infant&#xD;
      immunisation programme in teh UK since September 2004. The first children who received a&#xD;
      primary immunisation course exclusively of aP containing vaccine will reach 3.5 years, the&#xD;
      age at which their preschool booster will be given, from December 2007. This will be their&#xD;
      fourth dose of the aP containing vaccine and therefore provides the opportunity to define&#xD;
      with greater precision the incidence of ESL following vaccination in UK children with regard&#xD;
      to primary immunisation history of aP vs the previously used whole cell pertussis (wP)&#xD;
      vaccines. These children have been subject to a unique vaccination schedule compared to those&#xD;
      in the previous studies mentioned above. They will have been vaccinated under an accelerated&#xD;
      schedule compared to most other countries, at 2, 3 and 4 months, and will have had&#xD;
      meningococcal conjugate vaccine at the same time as their other primary immunisations. To&#xD;
      that end we will be asking parents/ guardians of individuals in receipt of the pre-school&#xD;
      booster to complete a health diary for a week following vaccination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Changes to the routine pre-school booster have recently been announced. These have been&#xD;
      instituted to provide a fourth dose of Hib vaccine to a cohort of children who, by virtue of&#xD;
      their birth date, have not had this dose. The lack of a fourth dose of Hib vaccine has been&#xD;
      recognised by the UK Department of Health Joint Committee for Vaccination and Immunisation as&#xD;
      potentially putting this group of children at greater risk of Hib disease. These children&#xD;
      have birth dates between 13 March 2003 and 3 September 2005 and were too young to be included&#xD;
      in the Hib catch up campaign in 2004, which included all children born April 1999 to October&#xD;
      2002 (ie 6 months to 4 years at the start of the campaign) and all those becoming 6 months of&#xD;
      age during the campaign (ie born October 2002 to March 2003) and are too old to have received&#xD;
      a dose of Menitorix since its introduction to the national schedule in September 2006. The&#xD;
      objective of the recently announced programme is to deliver a safe and effective booster&#xD;
      vaccine in the most logistically simple and cost-effective way. To that end most eligible&#xD;
      children will be given the Hib vaccine alongside the routine pre-school booster. At&#xD;
      pre-school, children are vaccinated with DTaP and inactivated polio vaccine (IPV). The Hib&#xD;
      vaccine will be delivered in the form of Infanrix-IPV-Hib or Pediacel which are both&#xD;
      DTaP-Hib-IPV combinations. There is a small percentage of children identified who have&#xD;
      already had their pre-school booster without the Hib component, so they will be re-called and&#xD;
      offered a dose of Menitorix, the MenC and Hib conjugate vaccine. The vaccines to be used in&#xD;
      this Hib campaign may be given to some children above the upper age limit specified in their&#xD;
      Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC) and in addition differ in antigen content from those&#xD;
      normally given at this age:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pediacel contains higher doses of diphtheria and some of the acellular pertussis&#xD;
           components than Repevax. The diphtheria content has previously been shown not to affect&#xD;
           reactogenicity as has the aP with the exception of swelling =3 cms on day 2 after&#xD;
           vaccination where swelling &gt;=3cm occurred in 17.5% of DTaP recipients compared with&#xD;
           10.0% of DT recipients (p= 0.02).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Older children will receive the tetanus conjugated Menitorix only a month after receipt&#xD;
           of their pre-school booster and may therefore have high tetanus antibody levels. This&#xD;
           has previously been shown to have no association with reactogenicity in a study where&#xD;
           the tetanus conjugate dose was similar to that included in the Menitorix vaccine. One of&#xD;
           the main objectives of the UK Vaccine Evaluation Consortium is to provide data that can&#xD;
           be used in planning and refining the national immunisation programme. Though there is a&#xD;
           body of evidence to support the safety of this campaign, it nevertheless provides a&#xD;
           natural opportunity for specialist Vaccine Research Nurses to interact with parents in&#xD;
           collecting safety data following administration of the preschool booster.&#xD;
