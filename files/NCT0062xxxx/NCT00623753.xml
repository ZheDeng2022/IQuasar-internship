    <textblock>
      Vaccines have been very successful in preventing viral infections such as hepatitis B and the&#xD;
      measles. Viral vaccines work by causing a person's immune system to make cells that will work&#xD;
      against the virus. Due to the success in treating other viral infections, scientists are&#xD;
      trying to develop a vaccine for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). HIV infection is the&#xD;
      cause of acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). AIDS is one of the most serious viral&#xD;
      infections we know.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a research study to evaluate the safety of a possible vaccine against HIV.&#xD;
      Researchers want to determine that a person's immune system can respond to the HIV before he&#xD;
      or she is exposed to it. Therefore that person may be able to be protected from infection&#xD;
      with HIV.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a research study to find out about the safety of a new potential vaccine regimen&#xD;
      against HIV. This potential vaccine regimen consists of a sequence of six vaccine shots that&#xD;
      are being studied to see if they can help to protect people from the human immunodeficiency&#xD;
      virus (HIV). HIV infection is the cause of AIDS. AIDS is one of the most serious viral&#xD;
      infections we know. Twenty million people around the world have already died of AIDS and over&#xD;
      40 million people are currently infected with the virus. This study is being done to help us&#xD;
      find an HIV vaccine that works.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vaccines have been very successful in preventing other viral infections, such as hepatitis B,&#xD;
      polio, and measles. Viral vaccines work by causing a person's immune system to make&#xD;
      antibodies and immune cells against the virus or to &quot;respond&quot; to the virus. Because of the&#xD;
      success with other viral infections, scientists are trying to develop a successful vaccine&#xD;
      for HIV. If a person's immune system can respond to HIV before he or she is exposed to it,&#xD;
      that person may be able to be protected from infection with HIV.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The vaccine regimen that will be tested in this study is based on the information that the&#xD;
      virus uses to make a small part of the HIV. This small part is called the &quot;envelope&quot; or&#xD;
      coating around the virus. Because only the information for this one part of the virus is used&#xD;
      in the vaccine, the vaccine cannot cause HIV infection. We make all parts of the vaccine&#xD;
      regimen in test tubes.&#xD;

    <description>Description: The vaccine regimen is a series of 6 injections given 28 days apart. EnvDNA is administered intramuscularly as 100 mcg of recombinant DNA in 1.5 mL of PBS as injections #1, 2 and 5. PolyEnv1 is recombinant vaccinia virus administered subcutaneously as 107 pfu in 0.8 mL of PBS as injection #3. EnvPro is administered intramuscularly as 100 mcg of recombinant protein and 500 mcg of aluminum hydroxide (alum) adjuvant in 1.0 mL of PBS as injections #4 and 6.</description>
