  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of peginesatide used to&#xD;
      treat anemia in subjects diagnosed with recurrent non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer&#xD;
      or prostate cancer and who also receiving a taxane chemotherapy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Currently approved erythropoiesis stimulating agents have been used successfully to increase&#xD;
      hemoglobin levels, reduce fatigue and other anemia-related symptoms, improve daily function,&#xD;
      and alleviate the need for transfusions of red blood cells in subjects with chronic kidney&#xD;
      disease-related anemia or in cancer subjects with chemotherapy-induced anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peginesatide (hematide) Injection is a parenteral formulation for administration by&#xD;
      intravenous or subcutaneous injection that is being developed for the correction of anemia in&#xD;
      patients with chronic kidney disease, including patients on dialysis and patients not on&#xD;
      dialysis, and for the treatment of patients with anemia due to concomitantly administered&#xD;
      chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a multicenter, open-label dose escalation study to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;
      and efficacy of multiple doses of peginesatide Injection in subjects with refractory&#xD;
      non-small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, or prostate cancer. These subjects must have&#xD;
      anemia diagnosed as a result of taxane chemotherapy.&#xD;
