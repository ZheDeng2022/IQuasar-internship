      The main aim of the study is to determine whether intracoronary infusion of autologous bone&#xD;
      marrow mononuclear cells can improve the ventricular function of patients with idiopathic&#xD;
      dilated cardiomyopathy.Secondary end-points will be:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate possible changes in patient functional capacity and&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to identify the biological characteristics of the bone marrow graft that might influence&#xD;
           on functional recovery.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Clinical studies have shown that bone marrow cells can regenerate damaged myocardium after&#xD;
      ischemic cardiopathy; however scarce information is available from patients with non-ischemic&#xD;
      dilated cardiomyopathy. The aim of the present work is to investigate the role of&#xD;
      intracoronary infusion of autologous marrow-derived stem cells in a phase II study in 30&#xD;
      patients with dilated cardiomyopathy.Before the intracoronary transplant of marrow cells as&#xD;
      well as six and twelve months thereafter, we will compare the ventricular function measured&#xD;
      as left-ventricular ejection fraction by angiography, magnetic resonance imaging,&#xD;
      echocardiography and treadmill direct oxygen consumption test. Functional capacity will be&#xD;
      monitored throughout the study. In every condition of the study we will perform at least one&#xD;
      30º right anterior oblique left ventricle (LV)angiogram. During each ventriculogram, attempts&#xD;
      will be made to obtain a sinus and a post-extrasystolic beat for analysis, in order to study&#xD;
      contractile reserve behaviours. Post-extrasystolic beats will be obtained by inducing&#xD;
      premature beats with the catheter, once a well opacified cardiac cycle with a normal sinus&#xD;
      beat had been filmed. In all instances, the r-r' interval of the induced premature beat and&#xD;
      the post-extrasystolic pause will be recorded and measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measurements and calculations will be made off line in our own core lab, where end-diastolic&#xD;
      and end-systolic silhouettes were drawn using the CASS system by 2 expert angiographers who&#xD;
      were unaware of the patient group or study conditions. LV-volumes and ejection fraction (EF)&#xD;
      were derived and regional wall motion was analyzed. The method by Sheehan (1) was used for&#xD;
      the asynergy study, dividing the superimposed silhouettes in 100 radii of wall shortening,&#xD;
      from end-diastole to end-systole. The abnormal contracting segment (ACS) was defined as the&#xD;
      percentage of radii showing akinesia or dyskinesia. The areas of the ventrivular walls having&#xD;
      asynergy will be regionally evaluated. The serial evolution of the contractile reserve will&#xD;
      be evaluated by the post-extrasystolic potentiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coronary Flow Reserve (CFR) in all 3 coronary arteries will also be evaluated during every&#xD;
      hemodynamic study (before treatment and 6 months after treatment). The FloMap® system&#xD;
      (Cardiometrics; Mountain View; California) will be used. A 0.014&quot; intracoronary Doppler guide&#xD;
      wire will be positioned proximally in every coronary and flow velocities will be recorded&#xD;
      continuously. Average peak velocity will be obtained at baseline and after an intracoronary&#xD;
      bolus of Adenosine. CFR will be calculated as the ratio between maximal flow velocity during&#xD;
      the peak effect of the adenosine injection and basal flow velocity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) studies will be performed in 3 conditions (baseline, 3-month&#xD;
      and 1-year after treatment). Functional parameters will be obtained in each condition,&#xD;
      including LV-volumes, LV-mass and ejection fraction&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the morning of cardiac catheterization, up to a volume of 100-150 ml of marrow will be&#xD;
      obtained under local anesthesia by aspiration from the iliac crest. Mononuclear Bone Marrow&#xD;
      Cells (MNBMCs) will be isolated by density gradient centrifugation over Ficoll-Hypaque&#xD;
      technique in a sterile, semiautomated device COBE® 2991. After three washes, MNBMCs will be&#xD;
      filtered and resuspended in 10 ml of 0.9% sodium chloride supplemented with preservative-free&#xD;
      0.1% heparin. Aliquots will be obtained for cell count as well as for cytofluorometric and&#xD;
      functional analyses of the cell content.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cells will be directly transferred to all 3 coronary arteries (50% to left anterior&#xD;
      descending artery, 25% to the circumflex and 25% to the right coronary artery) by the use of&#xD;
      a coaxial balloon catheter, which will be placed proximally at each artery. Balloon size will&#xD;
      be selected according to vessel size, in order to achieve complete occlusion of the vessel&#xD;
      and to stop flow during cell injection. So, backflow of cells is prevented and distal&#xD;
      stagnant flow will facilitate cell exposure. The cell suspension will be injected through the&#xD;
      distal tip of the balloon over 2 to 4 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition,we will try to compare all possible changes in functional parameters with&#xD;
      biological variables obtained from the marrow graft, such as:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Number of cells positive for cluster of differentiation antigen (CD) CD146,CD31,&#xD;
           CD133,CD90,CD38, CD117, CD73, CD105, CD45, Vascular endothelial growth factor receptor&#xD;
           2,CXC-chemokine receptor 4 and HLA-DR.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Functional characterization of endothelial progenitor cells and mesenchymal stem cells&#xD;
           present in the graft by in vitro selective cultures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Analysis of the in vitro chemotactic ability of the infused cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Determination of lineage-specific cardiac markers GATA-4 and Nk2.5/Csx in the infused&#xD;
           marrow-derived cells. Correlations between these biological parameters and the effects&#xD;
           on patient's ventricular function could highlight the role of each of the potential&#xD;
           mechanisms implied in cell-mediated myocardial regeneration.&#xD;
