  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to compare the changes in insulin sensitivity as well as&#xD;
      gastrointestinal hormone levels in diabetic and non-diabetic obese individuals who are&#xD;
      undergoing weight loss procedures. The main hypothesis of this study is that weight loss&#xD;
      induced by gastric bypass will induce a greater improvement in insulin sensitivity compared&#xD;
      with gastric banding or low calorie diet. Subjects will be studied before and after weight&#xD;
      loss. Studies consist of intravenous glucose tolerance test, body composition analysis, meal&#xD;
      test, and energy expenditure.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients who are scheduled for gastric bypass (GBP), sleeve gastrectomy (SG), or simple&#xD;
      caloric restriction with gastric banding (BND) or a very low calorie diet (VLCD) will be&#xD;
      examined at baseline weight, and when 6-10% total body weight has been lost. We will measure&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity with an intravenous glucose tolerance test, and fasting levels of&#xD;
      hormones that regulate food intake and insulin sensitivity, such as ghrelin, peptide YY&#xD;
      (PYY), glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP1) and leptin. Fat mass and skeletal muscle mass will be&#xD;
      measured by dual photon absorptiometry (DXA). We will also measure the hormonal and thermic&#xD;
      response to food with a liquid test meal and energy expenditure by indirect calorimetry. This&#xD;
      measures how many calories are burned at rest and the in response to food. Subjects with&#xD;
      diabetes will continue to be studied with the same protocol on an annual basis out to 5 years&#xD;
      in order to determine the rate of remission of diabetes and the durability of this effect as&#xD;
      subjects tend to regain some body weight over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with diabetes will also be followed every three months for the first year after the&#xD;
      initial weight loss for HbA1c and fasting glucose levels. The results of this study may lead&#xD;
      to new understanding about changes in insulin sensitivity, body composition and hormonal&#xD;
      profile, as well as changes in energy expenditure with weight loss after bariatric surgery or&#xD;
      with simple caloric restriction. With this greater understanding, new treatments for obesity&#xD;
      and diabetes, that do not require surgery, may be developed.&#xD;
