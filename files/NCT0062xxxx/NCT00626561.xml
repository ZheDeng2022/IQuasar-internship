      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To estimate the efficacy of bevacizumab and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent small cell,&#xD;
      large cell, and neuroendocrine cervical and uterine cancers, as measured by progression-free&#xD;
      survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To estimate the efficacy of bevacizumab and paclitaxel in patients with recurrent small&#xD;
           cell, large cell, and neuroendocrine cervical and uterine cancers, as measured by&#xD;
           overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To determine the response rates in patients with recurrent small cell, large cell, and&#xD;
           neuroendocrine cervical and uterine cancers when treated with bevacizumab and&#xD;
           paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To characterize the quality of life (QoL) in patients with recurrent small cell, large&#xD;
           cell, and neuroendocrine cervical and uterine cancers when treated with bevacizumab and&#xD;
           paclitaxel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To determine the nature and degree of toxicity in patients with advanced or recurrent&#xD;
           small cell, large cell, or neuroendocrine cervical and uterine cancers when treated with&#xD;
           bevacizumab and paclitaxel.&#xD;

      The Study Drugs:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Paclitaxel is designed to block the mechanisms of cell division in cancer cells, which may&#xD;
      cause them to die.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Bevacizumab is designed to prevent or slow down the growth of cancer cells by blocking the&#xD;
      effects of Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a blood-vessel stimulating agent that&#xD;
      plays an important role in the growth of both normal and abnormal blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Drug Administration:&#xD;
&#xD;
      If you are found to be eligible to take part in this study, on Days 1, 8, 15, and 22 of each&#xD;
      28-day study &quot;cycle&quot;, you will receive paclitaxel through a needle into your vein over 1&#xD;
      hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On Days 1 and 15 of each cycle, you will receive bevacizumab by vein. The first dose of&#xD;
      bevacizumab will be given over about 90 minutes. If the first dose is well tolerated, the&#xD;
      second dose may be given over about 60 minutes. If this is well tolerated, the third and any&#xD;
      other doses may be given over about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before you receive the study drugs, you will receive premedication (selected by your doctor)&#xD;
      to help prevent or lessen any side effects from the study drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Visits:&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 4 weeks, the following tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam and measurement of your vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and to test how your blood&#xD;
           clots.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About every 8 weeks, you will have a chest x-ray and a computed tomography (CT) or magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging (MRI) scan of your abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Length of Study:&#xD;
&#xD;
      You may stay on study for as long as you are benefitting. You will be taken off study early&#xD;
      if the disease gets worse or you experience intolerable side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      End-of-Study Visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After you go off study, you will have an end-of-study visit. At this visit, the following&#xD;
      tests and procedures will be performed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a physical exam, including a pelvic exam and measurement of your vital&#xD;
           signs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a performance status evaluation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blood (about 2-3 teaspoons) will be drawn for routine tests and possibly blood clotting&#xD;
           tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will have a CT or MRI of the abdomen and pelvis to check the status of the disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  You will be asked if you have experienced any side effects.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is an investigational study. Paclitaxel is FDA approved and commercially available for&#xD;
      the treatment of breast cancer, nonsmall cell lung cancer, ovarian cancers, and treatment of&#xD;
      AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Bevacizumab is FDA approved and commercially available&#xD;
      for use in combination with chemotherapy in patients with colon cancer, but its use in this&#xD;
      combination for this type of cancer is considered experimental.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 20 participants will take part in this study. All will be enrolled at M. D. Anderson.&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients with histologically confirmed, advanced stage (stage IVB), recurrent, or&#xD;
             persistent small cell, large cell, or neuroendocrine tumor of the uterine corpus and&#xD;

          2. All patients must have measurable disease. Measurable disease is defined as at least&#xD;
             one lesion that can be accurately measured in at least one dimension (longest&#xD;
             dimension to be recorded). Each lesion must be &gt; / = 20 mm when measured by&#xD;
             conventional techniques, including palpation, plain x-ray, CT, and MRI, or &gt; / = 10 mm&#xD;
             when measured by spiral CT. Biopsy confirmation is required if the lesion measures &lt;&#xD;

             normal (ULN), and measured or estimated creatinine clearance greater than or equal to&#xD;
             50 ml/min. For the purpose of estimating the creatinine clearance, the formula of&#xD;
             Jelliffe should be utilized. HEPATIC FUNCTION: Bilirubin less than or equal to 1.5 *&#xD;
             ULN. serum glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (SGOT) and alkaline phosphatase less&#xD;
             than or equal to 2.5 * ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients must have adequate: BLOOD COAGULATION PARAMETERS: prothrombin time (PT) such&#xD;
             that international normalized ratio (INR) is &lt; / = 1.5 (or an in-range INR, usually&#xD;

&#xD;
          1. Patients who have progressed through or recurred within 3 months of treatment with a&#xD;
             taxane agent administered on a weekly basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patients who have previously been treated with bevacizumab or other anti-angiogenic&#xD;
