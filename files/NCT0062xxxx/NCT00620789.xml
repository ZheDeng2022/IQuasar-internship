      This study is a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of Cognitive-Behavioral&#xD;
      Insomnia Therapy when used in isolation or in combination with antidepressant medication&#xD;
      (escitalopram) among patients with Major depressive disorder and insomnia.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent and debilitating condition that reduces&#xD;
      quality of life, increases health care utilization, markedly impairs social/occupational&#xD;
      functioning, and enhances suicide risk for countless individuals worldwide. A substantial&#xD;
      proportion of MDD patients present with comorbid insomnia that significantly complicates&#xD;
      their clinical management. For many such patients, insomnia represents a longstanding and&#xD;
      problematic condition that predates the onset of MDD, adds to their suicide risk, dampens&#xD;
      their response to traditional depression treatment, and enhances the likelihood for MDD&#xD;
      relapse. Moreover, many patients who show remission of depressive symptoms with traditional&#xD;
      therapies (e.g., antidepressant medications, cognitive therapy) suffer from residual insomnia&#xD;
      that increases their chances for eventual relapse. Despite the deleterious effects insomnia&#xD;
      may have on MDD patients, there has been surprisingly little research to test effective&#xD;
      insomnia management strategies among this patient group. Some reports suggest that depression&#xD;
      treatments may benefit from adding a hypnotic medication to traditional depression therapy,&#xD;
      but this approach has it limits since sleep improvements achieved with hypnotics do not&#xD;
      endure after hypnotic discontinuation. Cognitive-Behavioral Insomnia Therapy (CBT-I)&#xD;
      represents a promising alternative treatment for MDD since it is highly effective and&#xD;
      produces sleep improvements that persist well beyond the discontinuation of acute therapy.&#xD;
      Unfortunately CBT-I has yet to be tested among MDD patients with comorbid insomnia. In the&#xD;
      current project, we will conduct a randomized clinical trial to test the efficacy of CBT-I&#xD;
      when used in isolation or in combination with antidepressant medication (escitalopram) among&#xD;
      MDD patients with comorbid insomnia. A sample of 201 patients with MDD and comorbid insomnia&#xD;
      will be randomized to treatments consisting of the combination of antidepressant medication&#xD;
      plus CBT-I, antidepressant medication plus placebo behavioral insomnia therapy, or CBT-I plus&#xD;
      a placebo medication. Objective (polysomnography, actigraph) and subjective (sleep diary,&#xD;
      questionnaires) sleep measures, as well as depression and quality of life measures will be&#xD;
      obtained before therapy, after an 8-week treatment phase, and at 6-months follow-up. Results&#xD;
      of this trial will provide important new information about the short and long-term management&#xD;
      of those highly challenging and difficult to treat patients with insomnia comorbid to MDD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis I asserts that the combined CBT-I+AD therapy will produce significantly greater&#xD;
      pre-to-post therapy improvements in sleep continuity measures than will the 2 mono-therapy&#xD;
      conditions. The primary outcomes for these hypotheses are subjective (sleep diary) measures&#xD;
      of TWT and SE. These sleep measures are recorded daily for 2-week periods at baseline,&#xD;
      post-treatment, and the 6-month follow-up. The daily measures will be averaged over each&#xD;
      2-week period. As a result, patients will have three repeated outcomes for each of the two&#xD;
      sleep measures: one representing the average at baseline, one for the average at&#xD;
      post-treatment, and one for the average at 6-months. Sleep diary estimates of TWT and SE from&#xD;
      pre to post treatment will serve as the primary measures to test this hypothesis. Our&#xD;
      secondary outcome measures include diary estimates of total sleep time (TST), as well as&#xD;
      objective measures of TWT, SE, &amp; TST taken from pre-and post-treatment PSG and actigraphic&#xD;
      monitoring We will use a 3 (treatment groups) x 2 (Baseline vs. post-treatment) Analysis of&#xD;
      Variance (ANOVA) model to compare the performance of our treatment conditions across the&#xD;
      primary and secondary outcomes. Treatment comparisons of CBT-I + AD vs. each of the other 2&#xD;
      treatments will be made. Alpha for the 2 primary outcomes is fixed at 0.025 (= 0.05/2).&#xD;
      Further analyses will adjust for pre-treatment stratification variables and other covariates.&#xD;
      The investigators will, in particular, be mindful of the treatment adherence and credibility&#xD;
      data we collect and use these measures as covariates if the investigators find differential&#xD;
      adherence or credibility rates across treatment conditions. In addition, the investigators&#xD;
      will explore the effect of changes in medication on the observed changes in our outcome&#xD;
      measures by considering medication usage data derived from the MQS106.&#xD;
