  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to find out what effects gemcitabine plus capecitabine has on&#xD;
      patients with pancreatic or biliary cancer, and to determine the optimal dose that can be&#xD;
      given safely of these two drugs together (called the maximum tolerated dose). Gemcitabine and&#xD;
      capecitabine are two chemotherapy drugs used to treat pancreatic and biliary cancer. These&#xD;
      two drugs used together are considered an acceptable standard of care for pancreatic and&#xD;
      biliary cancers. However, in this study the dose and dosing schedule will be changed, in the&#xD;
      hopes that the drugs will have more effect with fewer side effects than when given in the&#xD;
      standard way.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically-confirmed pancreatic adenocarcinoma or biliary tract carcinoma&#xD;
             (cholangiocarcinoma or gallbladder cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Disease must not be amenable to surgical resection. Patients with either locally&#xD;
             advanced or metastatic disease are eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  No prior systemic therapy for their diagnosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ECOG performance score of 0-1&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of either or both of the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. RECIST-defined measurable disease (lesions that can be accurately measured in at&#xD;
                  least one dimension with the longest diameter ≥ 20mm using conventional&#xD;
                  techniques or ≥10 mm with spiral CT scan)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. An elevated serum CA19-9 at baseline ( ≥ 2X ULN)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female patients must be either surgically sterile or postmenopausal, or if of&#xD;
             childbearing potential must have a negative pregnancy test (serum or urine) prior to&#xD;
             enrollment and agree to use effective barrier contraception during the period of&#xD;
             therapy. Oral, implantable, or injectable contraceptives may be affected by cytochrome&#xD;
             P450 interactions, and are therefore not considered effective for this study. Male&#xD;
             patients must be surgically sterile or must agree to use effective contraception&#xD;
             during the period of therapy. The definition of effective contraception will be based&#xD;
             on the judgment of the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. ANC ≥ 1500/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. platelet count ≥ 100,000/uL&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate hepatic function:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Total bilirubin ≤ 1.5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. AST (SGOT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. ALT (SGPT) ≤ 2.5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate renal function as determined by either:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Calculated or measured creatinine clearance ≥ 40 mL/min (for calculated&#xD;
                  creatinine clearance, Cockroft-Gault equation will be used)&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Serum creatinine ≤ 1.5 X ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to swallow oral medications&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand the nature of this study protocol and give written informed&#xD;
             consent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Willingness and ability to comply with scheduled visits, treatment plans, laboratory&#xD;
             tests, and other study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any prior systemic or investigational therapy for metastatic or locally advanced&#xD;
             pancreatic cancer or biliary cancer. Systemic therapy administered alone or in&#xD;
             combination with radiation in the adjuvant setting is permissible as long as it was&#xD;
             completed &gt; 6 months prior to the time of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to comply with study and/or follow-up procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of other disease, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or&#xD;
             clinical laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the investigator, renders the subject at high risk from&#xD;
             treatment complications or might affect the interpretation of the results of the&#xD;
             study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Presence of central nervous system or brain metastases.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnancy (positive pregnancy test) or lactation.&#xD;

             cervical cancer, adequately treated Stage I or II cancer from which the patient is&#xD;
             currently in complete remission, or any other form of cancer from which the patient&#xD;
             has been disease-free for 5 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinically significant cardiac disease (e.g. congestive heart failure, symptomatic&#xD;
             coronary artery disease and cardiac arrhythmias not well controlled with medication)&#xD;
             or myocardial infarction within the last 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lack of physical integrity of the upper gastrointestinal tract or malabsorption&#xD;
             syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known, existing uncontrolled coagulopathy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery within 4 weeks of the start of study treatment, without complete&#xD;
             recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent/pre-existing use of coumadin.&#xD;
