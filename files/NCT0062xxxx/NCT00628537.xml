  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study looks at a new treatment for wrist and finger contractures -- a condition where the&#xD;
      affected hand is in a &quot;closed&quot; position, with the wrist and fingers stiff and difficult to&#xD;
      move from that position. We want to study if stimulation of wrist and finger muscles using an&#xD;
      implanted neuromuscular stimulator (BION) will be more or less effective than doing passive&#xD;
      exercises of the affected hand to improve the range of movement at wrist and finger joints.&#xD;
      Subjects of this study will be randomized into one of three groups: one doing passive&#xD;
      movement therapy; one receiving surface stimulation (electrical stimulation with electrodes&#xD;
      on the skin of the arm) and one doing BION® therapy. The passive movement group will do&#xD;
      therapy for 12 weeks. Subjects in either stimulation group will receive stimulation for 6&#xD;
      weeks and then only passive therapy for 6 weeks.&#xD;

      BION™ Experimental Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following implantation, the patients receiving BIONs will have a 3 to 7 day healing period.&#xD;
      During this period, subjects will not receive active therapy. At the end of this healing&#xD;
      period, subjects will come to the testing center so that the examiner can program the&#xD;
      exercise patterns. They will be instructed to increase the strength of their muscle&#xD;
      contractions as tolerance permits. The goal for the BION™ patients is to achieve 30 minutes&#xD;
      of stimulation twice daily, using a cycled stimulation at frequencies adequate to produce&#xD;
      tetanic contraction, (typically 25-35 pps) that raises the joint through full range of motion&#xD;
      against gravity (a range graded as 3/5) based on the available range of motion. The&#xD;
      intensity, duration and frequency of the exercise program will be modified according to the&#xD;
      progress of the participant, so that the strength of the contraction is increased over time.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface Stimulation Group&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be instructed to stimulate twice daily for 30 minutes through surface&#xD;
      electrodes placed according to instructions that the subject has been given. Stimulus&#xD;
      parameters will be similar to those reported in earlier successful stimulation studies. The&#xD;
      parameters should achieve a tetanic contraction that raises the joint through full range of&#xD;
      motion against gravity (graded 3/5) based on the patient's available range of motion, and&#xD;
      cycled, typically at 25-35 pps, using stimulus ramps as necessary so that contractions are&#xD;
      smoothly graded and comfortable. Every effort will be made to ensure that the parameters&#xD;
      needed in this group are chosen to produce a similar type of contraction to that obtained&#xD;
      with BION™ stimulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Group with conservative therapy (Range of motion exercises)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research participant is instructed in self-administered, standard range of motion&#xD;
      stretching exercises. If the patient is unable to stretch the fingers into extension, a&#xD;
      family member or a care-giver will be instructed to assist. They will be instructed to&#xD;
      exercise the affected hand twice daily, repeating the exercise a minimum of 15 times in each&#xD;
      session for 6 weeks. Control subjects will return to the clinic every two weeks for the first&#xD;
      6 weeks and every 3 weeks during the follow-up period. During these visits, passive range of&#xD;
      motion testing will be administered.&#xD;
