      Rationale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sensation of the need for urination (urge) is a complex and only partially understood&#xD;
      mechanism. It is our hypothesis that this mechanism is disrupted in patients suffering from&#xD;
      overactive bladder syndrome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Overactive Bladder syndrome (OAB) has been defined as a spectrum of symptoms in which&#xD;
      incontinence may or may not overlap with urgency, frequency and nocturia. This syndrome is&#xD;
      estimated to affect approximately 17% of the adult population in Europe and the United&#xD;
      States. The symptoms of overactive bladder have many potential causes and contributing&#xD;
      factors. One of these factors is an outlet obstruction of the bladder due to benign prostatic&#xD;
      hyperplasia (BPH). Nowadays antimuscarinic drugs are used for treatment of the overactive&#xD;
      bladder. Antimuscarinic agents have been proven to work slightly to moderately better than&#xD;
      placebo's and are associated with side effects such as a dry mouth, blurred vision and&#xD;
      constipation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Many patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) develop OAB. In this group of patients&#xD;
      with LUTS and OAB, there is not always a clear obstruction found. So, at least in some&#xD;
      patients, with LUTS, there must be another reason for OAB than obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The autonomous bladder activity has been introduced by, among others the Maastricht Urology&#xD;
      research group. In animal models, the bladder is shown to have rhythmic low amplitude&#xD;
      contractions (micro motions). It is hypothesized that this activity has a sensory function in&#xD;
      the micturation regulation system which is mainly located in the bladder wall. These so&#xD;
      called micromotions have never been demonstrated in the human bladder. The sensing function&#xD;
      of the bladder and the micturation reflex remain mainly unclear. We hypothesise that there is&#xD;
      a disregulation of the autonomous bladder activity (micro motions) in patients with OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to explore and study the relationship between OAB, obstruction and the micro motions&#xD;
      in order to gain a better understanding of the bladder (patho)physiology. reason for This on&#xD;
      its turn, can help us in the quest for better treatment strategies for patients suffering&#xD;
      from OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study is divided in two distinct groups a male and female group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The male group consist of patients with lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS). The female group&#xD;
      consist of patients with the overactive bladder syndrome OAB.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this pilot experiment is to describe via an observational study the&#xD;
      relation between non-micturation bladder activity and sensation during the filling phase of&#xD;
      the bladders in women. We want to explore if there is a relation between non-micturation&#xD;
      bladder activity and the sensation of urgency during the filling phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore in men, we want to study the relationship between non-micturation bladder&#xD;
      activity and the amount of obstruction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We would also like to visualize the micro motions of the bladder in both men and women during&#xD;
      filling phase and study the influence of (visual and cognitive) stimuli on bladder activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to explore if there is a relation between non-micturation bladder activity and the&#xD;
      sensation of urgency during the filling phase in male patients with Lower urinary tract&#xD;
      symptoms. In order to gain a better understanding in bladder (patho)physiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: A pilot observational study to describe the non-micturation bladder activity&#xD;
      and sensation measurement during filling phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population consists of two groups. First a group of patients (female) who will&#xD;
      undergo an ambulatory urodynamic investigation to investigate their bladder complaints. All&#xD;
      patients will be older than 18 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The second group consists of male patients who will undergo a conventional urodynamic&#xD;
      investigation in the normal work up for their lower urinary tract symptoms. All patients will&#xD;
      be older than 18 years.&#xD;

      Importance of the problem:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incontinence, increased urge and increased frequency of micturition affect nearly 100 million&#xD;
      people in the western world 1,2 (33 million in the US and 66 million in the European Union).&#xD;
      These conditions are not life threatening but they seriously affect quality of life and&#xD;
      ability to work. OAB is in some studies reported to have an incidence of up to 17 % in the&#xD;
      western population with great consequences for the quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) are more prevalent in the older population, where 40%&#xD;
      over the age of 70 years are affected. Therefore, LUTS represent major problems to&#xD;
      individuals, health professions and society. Importantly, as people are generally living&#xD;
      longer, the numbers affected by LUTS are increasing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Economic cost:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The total economic cost of this group of conditions is high. In 2002 the costs in the US were&#xD;
      approximately $12.7 billion1 (estimated to be $17 billion and â‚¬22 billion/year in 2005).&#xD;
      Approximately 25% of this expenditure is spent on treatment (drug therapy, clinical&#xD;
      consultation and surgery). Of those who suffer only 28% have sought help and only half of&#xD;
      those currently receive treatment. Less than 3% regain long lasting normal control.&#xD;
      Therefore, these costs are an under-estimate and the problem is large.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aetiology:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary clinical problem in the overactive bladder syndrome is an increased urge to pass&#xD;
      urine, with or without incontinence. Remarkably, despite the prevalence and costs involved,&#xD;
      the mechanisms underlying increased urge are not known. In order to simply describe the&#xD;
      condition the term 'Over Active Bladder (OAB) Symptom Complex' has been introduced. In many&#xD;
      cases, studied using conventional urodynamics, sensations of urge are correlated with rises&#xD;
      in intra-vesical pressure, a condition classified as detrusor over activity (DO). In the&#xD;
      remainder of patients, sensation is not accompanied by pressure changes and the condition can&#xD;
      be described as bladder over activity (BO), previously described as sensory urgency. These&#xD;
      differences in the relationship between sensation and bladder activity may be indicative of&#xD;
      different clinical states. However, it is more likely that we don't yet understand the nature&#xD;
      of the clinical condition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lower urinary tract symptoms are mostly caused by obstruction which is often caused by benign&#xD;
      prostatic hypertrophia (BPH).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will be conducted among two distinct groups. a male and a female group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Female group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the female group the patients will be asked to describe their complaints while standard&#xD;
      ambulatory urodynamic investigation takes place. Patients are asked to spend one hour of the&#xD;
      six hours time which is the normal time for ambulatory urodynamics with us in the clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During this time patients are asked to sit or stand up right and answer a few questions about&#xD;
      their bladder sensations. Normally patients are free to go home and with this study these&#xD;
      women are asked to spend the first hour in our clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to fill in a self-consciousness questionnaire in the period around the&#xD;
      urodynamic measurement. They can do that before or after the measurement at home. This will&#xD;
      take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked to think of the answer to a few questions shown on a computer&#xD;
      screen, during the urodynamic measurements. They will also be shown a few pictures, e.g.&#xD;
      toilets or landscape pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, at the beginning of the normal procedure for a ambulatory&#xD;
      urodynamic measurement the vesical catheter which is inserted in the patient for the purpose&#xD;
      of the ambulatory urodynamic measurement will be connected to a more sensitive measuring&#xD;
      device (PASAQ) with a 601 certification, designed by the IDDEE department of the Maastricht&#xD;
      university and approved by the Maastricht university hospital technical department. (Mr.&#xD;
      Frank Meeuwissen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bladder of the patient will be filled physiologically by the kidneys after drinking&#xD;
      fluids, we will measure with a high sensibility, and try to study the small bladder&#xD;
      contractions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At intervals of 15 minutes the patient will be shown a computer screen on which 2 questions&#xD;
      will be written. (e.g. Do you have a desire to void now?) the patient does not need to answer&#xD;
      that question. We hypothesize that thinking of this question will trigger very small bladder&#xD;
      contractions which allows the brain to , feel ' the bladder filling. The patient will also be&#xD;
      shown a few pictures (e.g. a toilet and a landscape picture) in order to assess the effect of&#xD;
      , and the difference between these visual stimuli on bladder contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The male group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the study of male patients who are undergoing a standard stationary urodynamic measurement&#xD;
      in the normal diagnostic work for their lower Urinary tract symptoms are asked to take part&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This means that the measurement will take some 10 minutes more and that they are asked to&#xD;
      fill in a questionnaire. There will be no extra catheter insertion or any invasive&#xD;
      measurements added to the normal procedure of the conventional urodynamic measurements which&#xD;
      they are undergoing for their symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be asked to fill in a self-consciousness questionnaire in the period around the&#xD;
      urodynamic measurement. They can do that before or after the measurement at home. This will&#xD;
      take about 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will also be asked to think of the answer to a few questions shown on a computer&#xD;
      screen, during the urodynamic measurements. They will also be shown a few pictures, e.g.&#xD;
      toilets or landscape pictures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We want to study the effect of such a visual or cognitive stimuli on the bladder contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After obtaining informed consent, at the end of the normal procedure for a conventional&#xD;
      urodynamic measurement the vesical catheter will remain in the patient for about ten minutes&#xD;
      longer. This catheter is then connected to a more sensitive measuring device (PASAQ) with a&#xD;
      601 certification, designed by the IDDEE department of the Maastricht university and approved&#xD;
      by the Maastricht university hospital technical department. (Mr. Frank Meeuwissen).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The bladder of the patient will be filled just like in a normal urodynamic measurement up to&#xD;
      3 different fillings, 100, 200 and 300 ml. At each of these filling amounts, the pomp will be&#xD;
      stopped during 2 minutes and we will measure with a high sensibility, and try to study the&#xD;
      small bladder contractions. At the 300 ml filling the patient will be shown a computer screen&#xD;
      on which 2 questions will be written. (e.g. Do you have a desire to void now?) the patient&#xD;
      does not need to answer that question. We hypothesise that thinking of this question will&#xD;
      trigger very small bladder contractions which allows the brain to , feel ' the bladder&#xD;
      filling. The patient will also be shown a few pictures (e.g. a toilet and a landscape&#xD;
      picture) in order to assess the effect of , and the difference between these visual stimuli&#xD;
      on bladder contraction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the female group the main study parameters will be to characterize non-micturition&#xD;
      activity during bladder filling in relation to visual and cognitive stimuli. This new high&#xD;
      definition device will allow us to measure small an delicate changes in bladder pressure and&#xD;
      allow us to relate this activity to bladder volume and sensation, to determine the nature of&#xD;
      any change in this activity associated with OAB. The secondary study parameters are to&#xD;
      identify possible mechanisms underlying OAB, to explore the possibility that therapeutically&#xD;
      important drugs for OAB exert their action via inhibition of non-micturition activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main study parameters in the male group are to characterize non-micturition activity&#xD;
      during bladder filling, to relate this activity to bladder volume and sensation, to determine&#xD;
      the nature of any change in this activity associated with OAB and assess the relationship&#xD;
      between the OAB symptoms with the amount of obstruction. The secondary study parameters are&#xD;
      to identify possible mechanisms underlying OAB, to explore the possibility that&#xD;
      therapeutically important drugs for OAB exert their action via inhibition of non-micturition&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: Patients that participate in this study will not be exposed to serious adverse&#xD;
      events and there will be no side effects. The investigation that they undergo for the normal&#xD;
      workup of their complaints will take about ten minutes longer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patients will be asked to fill in an extra question list the so called self-consciousness&#xD;
      questionnaire.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will benefit of this study in directly, because it will be helpful in getting&#xD;
      information on non-micturation activity and the relation with sensation. The results&#xD;
      hopefully will lead to a better understanding of the normal and pathological bladder.&#xD;
