    <textblock>
      Stroke is the third leading cause of death in the United States, responsible for 158,488&#xD;
      deaths in 1998 (American Heart Association). Nationwide, each year, an estimated 600,000 to&#xD;
      750,000 people suffer a new or recurrent stroke. Cerebral infarction comprises 80% of all&#xD;
      strokes and is the result of a complex series of cellular metabolic events that occur rapidly&#xD;
      after interruption of blood flow to a region of the brain. The extent of the brain damage is&#xD;
      dependent on the duration and severity of the cerebral ischemia. Acute thrombus formation or&#xD;
      migration is the principal cause of blood flow interruption in at least 75% of cerebral&#xD;
      infarctions. In several animal models of focal cerebral ischemia, restoration of cerebral&#xD;
      blood flow within two to six hours after initial occlusion has been associated with smaller&#xD;
      volumes of cerebral infarction and improved functional outcome. An effective way of&#xD;
      dissolving the thrombus is by administration of recombinant tissue plasminogen activator or&#xD;
      Activase (Alteplase, rt-PA), which promotes the proteolytic action of plasmin from&#xD;
      plasminogen at the site of a clot. In this study, the drug, Activase, will be administered in&#xD;
      subjects with acute ischemic stroke (AIS) intravenously (IV) or by local intra-arterial (IA)&#xD;
      injection. The use of the intravenous administration within 3 hours of stroke symptom onset&#xD;
      is FDA approved whereas the intra-arterial administration, despite evidence of potential&#xD;
      benefit, is not currently FDA approved. Although not FDA approved, this study will evaluate&#xD;
      the effectiveness of IA thrombolysis with Activase, used in AIS because of its higher rate of&#xD;
      recanalization , potential expansion of the time window out to 6 hours, and lower doses of&#xD;
      thrombolytic agent used compared with systemic or intravenous Activase. The study is designed&#xD;
      to test the feasibility and provide preliminary safety data regarding the relative benefits&#xD;
      and risks of IA Activase as compared to IV Activase when administered per the NINDS rt-PA&#xD;
      stroke study protocol, i.e. randomized within 3 hours of onset of symptoms of ischemic stroke&#xD;
      then treated within 3 hours in the IV Activase arm and within 4 hours in the IA Activase arm.&#xD;

      DESCRIPTION OF THE STUDY This is a randomized, controlled, single center feasibility and&#xD;
      preliminary safety study to determine the clinical efficacy of Activase administered locally,&#xD;
      IA, in the course of an angiogram, as compared with Activase systemic IV infusion, in&#xD;
      subjects with a ischemic stroke due to major vessel occlusion (M1, M2, terminal ICA, basilar&#xD;
      or vertebral) detected by CT angiography, within 3 hours of symptoms onset. IV Activase (0.9&#xD;
      mg kg-1, maximum 90 mg) will be administered as per the NINDS protocol and IA Activase (2 mg&#xD;
      bolus, followed by 10 mg hr-1 for 2 hours or TIMI 3 recanalization, whichever is earlier,&#xD;
      maximum total dose 22 mg) will be administered as per the protocol used in the IMS-2 study&#xD;
      with administration initiated within 4 hours from symptom onset and completed within 6 hours&#xD;
      from symptom onset. The subject will be randomized following CT angiography after the&#xD;
      demonstration of complete occlusion or minimal perfusion of symptom-related M1 segment and/or&#xD;
      M2, distal ICA, vertebral artery or basilar artery. The primary analysis will be focused on&#xD;
      feasibility of such a trial in terms of time-frame, preliminary safety analysis (the&#xD;
      proportion of symptomatic intracranial hemorrhages) and preliminary risk-benefit ratio of IA&#xD;
      Activase when compared with IV Activase. Secondary analyses will include the proportion of&#xD;
      subjects exhibiting significant neurological improvement, reduction in disability and&#xD;
      recanalization on a MRA or CTA. The sample size for this feasibility trial was estimated&#xD;
      taking into account that it will be done in a single center, involve a major investment in&#xD;
      time, personnel, and equipment required. IA thrombolysis as compared to IV thrombolysis,&#xD;
      should be justified only with evidence of a superior clinical efficacy. A larger multicenter&#xD;
      feasibility trial will need to be planned to determine safety and estimate sample size for an&#xD;
      efficacy trial. An outside, independent safety monitor will assess the safety of the&#xD;
      treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A majority of clinical trials involving AIS conducted since the NINDS Activase stroke study&#xD;
      have yielded negative results, emphasizing the point that recanalization and not&#xD;
      neuroprotection can lead to clinical improvement. A recent randomized clinical trial (PROACT)&#xD;
      showed the efficacy (recanalization and clinical improvement) of IA thrombolysis with&#xD;
      Prourokinase for acute ischemic stroke &lt;6 h from symptom onset, due to occlusion of proximal&#xD;
      MCA. Although not FDA approved, IA thrombolysis with Activase, used in AIS is attractive&#xD;
      because of higher rates of recanalization, potential extension of the time window out to 6&#xD;
      hours from symptom onset, and lower doses of thrombolytic agent used compared with systemic&#xD;
      or IV Activase and a possible lower rate of symptomatic ICH (5-7%) compared with IA Pro-UK&#xD;
      (10.9%). Support for use of IV Activase comes mainly from the NINDS study, whereas that for&#xD;
      IA Activase comes from the PROACT study and a metanalysis of several anecdotal series.&#xD;
      However, these two therapeutic approaches have never been compared in a randomized controlled&#xD;
      trial. IA Activase may be used in AIS due to major vessel occlusion, whereas IV Activase may&#xD;
      be used independent of the presence or absence of major vessel occlusion. CT angiography can&#xD;
      rapidly detect major vessel occlusion and hence candidacy for IA thrombolysis. An ongoing&#xD;
      pilot (IMS-2 trial) assessing the use of combination of IV and IA thrombolysis and comparing&#xD;
      it with historical control has one draw-back in that the subjects are being subjected to a&#xD;
      dual risk of hemorrhage by IV (6%) + IA (5-7%) Activase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The rationale for the study design is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Random assignment: to reduce treatment assignment bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Controlled: the appropriate control group being the FDA approved IV Activase&#xD;
           administration.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Open label: as intra-arterial and intravenous administration is difficult to blind&#xD;
           observers because of the difference in route of administration that is obvious to the&#xD;
           observer and the subject. Sham intra-arterial stick that can be used to camouflage the&#xD;
           information, may be extremely dangerous in the intra-venous group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Blinded 90-day assessment: to remove assessment bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method of Treatment Assignment Block randomization (1:1) will be used to assign equal numbers&#xD;
      of subjects to the IV and IA arms. In the preliminary feasibility study twelve subjects will&#xD;
      be randomly assigned to receive IV (N=6) and IA (N=6) Activase. The treatment will remain&#xD;
      open label to the treating physician. A physician blinded to the treatment arm will assess&#xD;
      the 90-day outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Treatment Activase will be administered IV or IA based on random assignment. The IV&#xD;
      administration will be in accordance to the FDA approved guidelines based on the NINDS rt-PA&#xD;
      stroke study. The IA administration is considered investigational and will be in accordance&#xD;
      to the ongoing IMS-2 study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cathetrization and Intra-arterial Alteplase protocol: A sheath will be placed in the femoral&#xD;
      artery by a 1-wall puncture and arteriography performed by standard technique. If the&#xD;
      suspected distribution of ischemia is the carotid artery, injection of the common carotid&#xD;
      artery for examination of the carotid bifurcation as well as for intracranial examination&#xD;
      will be performed. If the suspected arterial distribution is vertebral or basilar artery,&#xD;
      selective injection of both vertebral arteries will be performed. Arteriographic examination&#xD;
      of the remainder cerebral vessels will be performed if examination of collateral flow to the&#xD;
      brain is deemed essential for determining treatment strategies. Five thousand units of&#xD;
      heparin will be administered IV as a bolus at the beginning of the procedure. No post bolus&#xD;
      IV heparin will be administered. Per standard neurointerventional procedure, a heparin flush&#xD;
      solution (eg, 1000 U in 500 mL) normal saline at ~2 U of heparin/min) will be used through&#xD;
      the access sheath and continued till the sheath is removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performing diagnostic cerebral arteriogram, a 3F, tapered, variable-stiffness, end-hole&#xD;
      microcatheter will be passed over a micro-guide wire to the level of occlusion. One milligram&#xD;
      of Activase will be injected beyond the thrombus and the catheter retracted into the proximal&#xD;
      thrombus where an additional one milligram of Activase will be injected. A maximum of 22 mg&#xD;
      of Activase will be administered in pulse spray fashion at a rate of 1mg every 6 minutes up&#xD;
      to 10 mg/hr for 2 hrs till the maximum dose is reached or a TIMI 3 flow is noted on&#xD;
      arteriographic examination. Repeat arteriography will be performed every 15 minutes using&#xD;
      isosmolar contrast during the intra-arterial administration to assess recanalization. If the&#xD;
      vessel is not patent the intra-arterial administration is continued. If the vessel is&#xD;
      partially recanalized, the infusion catheter is introduced further into the vessel for&#xD;
      thrombus access. If the arterial catheter cannot be introduced into the thrombus, the&#xD;
      Activase will be administered proximal to the thrombus as described above. The subject's&#xD;
      neurological function will be evaluated every 15 minutes during the IA procedure, including&#xD;
      level of consciousness, speech examination, cranial nerve examination, and upper extremity&#xD;
      motor and sensory function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the subject did not have an occlusion on the initial arteriogram in the vascular territory&#xD;
      appropriate for the subject's symptoms, no Activase will be administered, and the procedure&#xD;
      terminated (these subjects will be included in the overall analysis). If the subject has a&#xD;
      significant stenosis or occlusion of the internal carotid, vertebral or basilar arteries, the&#xD;
      stenosis/occlusion is traversed with the microcatheter to approach a distal occlusive&#xD;
      thrombus. The use of Activase(IV) in an acute ischemic stroke is standard of care. IA&#xD;
      Activase is being performed clinically, but is not standard of care. Intravenous Activase&#xD;
      protocol: is essentially identical to the NINDS rt-PA stroke study. In accordance with the&#xD;
      protocol, AIS subjects will be treated with IV Activase within 180 minutes from symptom&#xD;
      onset. Symptom onset is defined in the usual manner as the last time at which the subject was&#xD;
      known to be asymptomatic. A total dose of 0.9 mg/kg body weight (max 90 mg) will be&#xD;
      administered, 10% of it given as IV push over 1 minute and the remainder 90% as an IV&#xD;
      infusion over 1 hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One week, one month, and three months after receiving Activase IV or IA the subject will&#xD;
      spend 10 to 20 minutes talking to a doctor and being examined to check recovery from the&#xD;
      stroke. In addition, 60 days after receiving the study drug, the study coordinator will&#xD;
      contact the subject by phone to ask questions about overall feeling of health. This telephone&#xD;
      contact is expected to take about five minutes. One follow-up visit after the subject has&#xD;
      left the hospital is standard care for someone who has had a stroke. Other visits and the&#xD;
      telephone call are for research purposes only.&#xD;
