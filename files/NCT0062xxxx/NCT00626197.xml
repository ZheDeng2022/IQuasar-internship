    <measure>Number of Participants Who Achieved Complete Renal Response (CRR)</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>CRR was defined as: 1. Normal serum creatinine (and with no more than a 25 percent [%] increase from Baseline); 2. Improvement in urinary protein:urinary creatinine ratio to less than or equal to (≤) 0.5. PRR was defined as at least 50 percent (%) reduction in proteinuria from Baseline, without more than 25% increase of serum creatinine at Week 48, compared with Baseline. If Baseline urine protein:urine creatinine ratio was greater than (&gt;) 3, a urine protein:urine creatinine ratio of less than (&lt;) 3 needed to be achieved.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Percentage of Participants Who Achieved Overall Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Week 48</time_frame>
    <description>Overall response rate (ORR) equals (=) CRR + PRR. CRR was defined as: 1. Normal serum creatinine (and with no more than a 25% increase from baseline) 2.

    <measure>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Major Clinical Response or a Partial Clinical Response</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline and Weeks 1, 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36, 40, 44, and 48</time_frame>
    <description>A major clinical response was defined as British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) C scores or better at Week 24 without developing any new A or two new B scores up to Week 24 and maintenance of this response without developing a moderate or severe flare between Week 24 and Week 48. A partial clinical response was defined as BILAG C scores or better at Week 24 and maintaining this response without developing a flare for 16 consecutive weeks. The BILAG is an organ-specific 86-question assessment based on the principle of the doctor's intent to treat, which requires an assessment of improved (1), the same (2), worse (3), or new (4) over the last month. Within each organ system, multiple manifestations and laboratory tests are combined into a single score for that organ. The resulting scores for each organ can be A through E, where A is very active disease, B is moderate activity, C is mild stable disease, D is resolved activity, and E indicates the organ was never involved.</description>

The SOC regimens were: Euro-Lupus (cyclophosphamide 500 mg every 2 weeks for 6 doses followed by azathioprine maintenance at 1-2 milligrams per kilogram per day [mg/kg/day]), or MMF 1 g/day in the first week increased to 3 g/day. Participants also received methylprednisolone 100 mg infusion IV or according to local guidelines, completed at least 30 minutes prior to each infusion of ocrelizumab. Participants also received oral prednisone at starting dose of 0.75 mg/kg/day with a maximum dose of 60 mg/day from Day 2. Beginning on Day 16 the doses were tapered and continued for 10 weeks to a target dose of 10 mg/day.</description>

          <description>The FACIT Fatigue Scale is a short, 13-item, easy-to-administer tool that measures an individual's level of fatigue during their usual daily activities over the past week. The level of fatigue is measured on a four point Likert scale (4 = not at all fatigued to 0 = very much fatigued).</description>

        <title>Percentage of Participants Achieving a Major Clinical Response or a Partial Clinical Response</title>
        <description>A major clinical response was defined as British Isles Lupus Assessment Group (BILAG) C scores or better at Week 24 without developing any new A or two new B scores up to Week 24 and maintenance of this response without developing a moderate or severe flare between Week 24 and Week 48. A partial clinical response was defined as BILAG C scores or better at Week 24 and maintaining this response without developing a flare for 16 consecutive weeks. The BILAG is an organ-specific 86-question assessment based on the principle of the doctor's intent to treat, which requires an assessment of improved (1), the same (2), worse (3), or new (4) over the last month. Within each organ system, multiple manifestations and laboratory tests are combined into a single score for that organ. The resulting scores for each organ can be A through E, where A is very active disease, B is moderate activity, C is mild stable disease, D is resolved activity, and E indicates the organ was never involved.</description>
