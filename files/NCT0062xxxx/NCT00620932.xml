      Approximately 40 people will take part in this study and all of these people will take part&#xD;
      at Duke University Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this study involves the following.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will ask you to perform a cardiopulmonary exercise test (walking stress test) to&#xD;
           determine if you have any undiagnosed cardiovascular health problems that may limit your&#xD;
           ability to participate in an exercise training program. This test will take place at the&#xD;
           Duke Center for Living on Duke University Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete a body composition assessment. This test is designed to determine your body fat&#xD;
           and lean body tissue (muscle mass) percentage and will consist of you sitting quietly in&#xD;
           a chamber with appropriate medical supervision. This test also will take place at the&#xD;
           Duke Center for Living on Duke University Campus.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Complete two questionnaires one at the beginning and one at the end that asks about how&#xD;
           you are feeling and about your physical activity levels. The questionnaire takes about&#xD;
           20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Provide two blood samples one at the beginning and one at the end to measure levels of&#xD;
           cardiovascular disease risk factors (cholesterol levels, c-reactive protein and insulin&#xD;
           levels) in your blood that may be influenced by exercise. Blood collection will be drawn&#xD;
           by medical staff at Duke University. The amount of blood drawn is approximately 2&#xD;
           teaspoons (10ml).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  We will also collect information on how much treatment you receive as well as how many&#xD;
           and what type of side-effects you have from your medical treatment. This information&#xD;
           will be obtained from your medical chart following the completion of your treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the successful completion of all initial tests and procedures (as described above),&#xD;
      you will be randomly assigned (like flipping a coin) to one of the following two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exercise Training Group: You will be given a customized training program aimed at&#xD;
           increasing cardiorespiratory fitness. You will be asked to exercise 3 to 5 times per&#xD;
           week. All sessions will include a 5 minute warm-up and 5 minute cool-down at the&#xD;
           beginning and end of each session totaling 30-45 minutes per session. You will also&#xD;
           receive a heart rate monitor to record each exercise session to monitor adherence and&#xD;
           compliance. You will receive telephone calls every two weeks to provide encouragement,&#xD;
           outline goals, and provide feedback on study progress.&#xD;
&#xD;
           OR&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Wait-List Control Group: You will be asked to maintain your usual exercise levels during&#xD;
           the 6 month study period. You will receive telephone calls to report your levels of&#xD;
           exercise during the study. After study completion you will receive a heart rate monitor&#xD;
           and an individualized exercise prescription based on your cardiorespiratory fitness test&#xD;
           at the end of the study period (6 months).&#xD;
