    <textblock>
      Research has shown that the presence of heart disease and stroke is higher in the Indo-Asian&#xD;
      population compared to other ethno-cultural groups. This may be due to multiple reasons such&#xD;
      as a higher presence of diabetes, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, obesity, and lower&#xD;
      levels of physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This program will bring together the Calgary Indo-Central-Asian communities and the Calgary&#xD;
      Healthcare community to help reduce the rate of heart disease and stroke through a&#xD;
      supportive, culturally-sensitive program that is community-based through the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Increase awareness of heart disease and stroke through education among the Calgary&#xD;
           Indo-Central-Asian population.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Identify early, the risk factors related to heart disease and stroke through screening&#xD;
           programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Provide appropriate follow-up care to the population at risk for heart disease and&#xD;
           stroke.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide.&#xD;
      Various studies have confirmed that individuals of SE Asian descent have a higher prevalence&#xD;
      of cardiovascular disease compared with other ethnicities due to higher prevalence of&#xD;
      metabolic syndrome, diabetes, insulin resistance, central obesity, dyslipidemias (lower&#xD;
      high-density lipoprotein, increased lipoprotein[a], higher triglyceride levels), increased&#xD;
      thrombotic tendency (increased plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 and decreased tissue&#xD;
      plasminogen activator levels), and decreased levels of physical activity&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypertension, in particular has become one of the leading causes of mortality among Asians.&#xD;
      Projected figures suggest that in Indo-Asians hypertension prevalence will increase from&#xD;
      16.3% to 19.5% between 1995 and 2025. Despite increased prevalence of hypertension among&#xD;
      Indo-Asians, the majority of cases remain undetected and poorly managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disparities in health system utilization are associated with a high prevalence of&#xD;
      hypertension leading to increased numbers of patients presenting with target organ damage&#xD;
      such as stroke, heart failure and renal insufficiency. Epidemiological studies have&#xD;
      demonstrated that high-risk ethnic groups have access barriers to mainstream programs and may&#xD;
      benefit from targeted and culture specific interventions. Given that Indo-Asians represent an&#xD;
      increasing proportion of the Canadian population and are at higher risk of cardiovascular&#xD;
      diseases and experience health care access barriers, the initiation of an tailored risk&#xD;
      factor screening and intervention program is timely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collaborative effort between the target communities and the healthcare system provides an&#xD;
      unique opportunity to develop and evaluate a sustainable screening, early detection and&#xD;
      intervention program in hypertension and other CVD risk factors, tailored to meet the unique&#xD;
      cultural needs of the target population. Only an all encompassing program of this scope will&#xD;
      reduce the risk of cardiovascular diseases in this highly susceptible population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project objectives are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase Indo-Central Asian community awareness of cardiovascular risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop and implement a community based, culturally sensitive and self-sustaining&#xD;
           cardiovascular risk factor screening and management program.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To increase early detection of modifiable, undiagnosed, and uncontrolled cardiovascular&#xD;
           risk factors&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Using a partnership-based, culturally appropriate and integrated approach, provide a&#xD;
           sustainable and cost effective intervention program for optimal management of risk&#xD;
           factors in the Indo-Central Asian population utilizing existing health region and&#xD;
           community resources.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To develop a continuum of care that addresses the needs of Indo-Central Asian Calgarians&#xD;
           and that tailors the intensity of intervention to the perceived risk&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To validate the &quot;Continuum of Care&quot; process&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project components are as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Screening sessions: The project will utilize a previously developed Indo-Asian Diabetes&#xD;
      Initiative methodology to recruit and train volunteers from the target community. Using&#xD;
      standardized interview questions, the following information will be collected: age, gender,&#xD;
      family history (first degree relative with premature cardiovascular disease), and other&#xD;
      cardiovascular risk factors. Trained volunteers would administer the questions during one to&#xD;
      one interviews in English or a common language used by the participant in the community.&#xD;
      Blood pressures will be obtained using a validated Bp assessment tool (BpTRU). All those&#xD;
      screened that have either high blood pressure (≥140/90 or ≥130/80 with diabetes) or at least&#xD;
      one risk factor (positive family or personal history of cardiovascular disease, diabetes,&#xD;
      smoker, known elevated cholesterol or on medications for HBP, lipids or diabetes) will then&#xD;
      go on to have capillary measurements of random TC/HDL performed by the Cholestech desktop&#xD;
      reflometer (Hayward CA).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on health history and assessments obtained, the total CVD risk (coronary heart disease&#xD;
      and stroke) will be predicted using the Joint British Societies Cardiovascular Disease Risk&#xD;
      Prediction Chart. Those participants found to be high risk (&gt;20 % 10 year CVD risk) will be&#xD;
      referred, via the family physician, to a HRIC clinic. Those at moderate or low risk (≤20% 10&#xD;
      year CVD risk) will be referred to the CDM program. All participants that are screened will&#xD;
      receive the adapted and culturally sensitive versions of the 2007 Canadian Public&#xD;
      Recommendations education booklet (adapted by Blood Pressure Canada) that includes&#xD;
      hypertension, dietary, alcohol and smoking cessation information.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: All qualifying participants will be assessed by a volunteer pharmacist,&#xD;
           nurse, physician, or other health care professional who will review the participants'&#xD;
           current medications and provide education around adherence and adverse events. The&#xD;
           completed assessments and the predicted risk scores will be reviewed with the&#xD;
           participant. The predicted risk score will facilitate the participant's enrolment in the&#xD;
           appropriate follow up program. Participants will be re-directed back to the family&#xD;
           physician for BP monitoring and medication initiation or adjustment as required.&#xD;
           Participants will be provided with a &quot;Health Report&quot; that will include their current&#xD;
           medications, blood pressures, TC and HDL results, predicted CVD risk score and follow-up&#xD;
           instructions. Interventions will be as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  High CVD Risk Intervention: Individuals at high risk will be referred to a High&#xD;
                Risk Intervention Clinic for full cardiovascular evaluation. This includes a&#xD;
                history and physician exam by an Internal Medicine Specialist or alternate&#xD;
                specialist with similar cardiovascular training and experience An ECG will be&#xD;
                performed and likely either a stress test or nuclear cardiology study. Risk factors&#xD;
                will be aggressively managed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Low and Moderate CVD Risk Intervention: Individuals at low or moderate risk will be&#xD;
                referred to a convenient and culturally appropriate CDM community program&#xD;
                (culturally sensitive education and physical activity programs).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Follow-up Sessions: Consenting participants will be contacted by a project volunteer and&#xD;
           be invited back for reassessment one year after initial evaluation. Reassessment will&#xD;
           entail a work-up similar to that conducted during the initial screening session.&#xD;
