      RATIONALE: Electroacupuncture may help relieve chronic dry mouth caused by radiation therapy.&#xD;
      It is not yet known whether electroacupuncture is more effective than a placebo in treating&#xD;
      chronic dry mouth caused by radiation therapy in patients with head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PURPOSE: This randomized clinical trial is studying electroacupuncture to see how well it&#xD;
      works compared with a placebo in treating chronic dry mouth caused by radiation therapy in&#xD;
      patients with head and neck cancer.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if electrostimulation using the Liss stimulator can objectively improve&#xD;
           salivary flow as measured by sialometry compared to a placebo device in patients with&#xD;
           chronic radiation-induced xerostomia and head and neck cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To determine if electrostimulation using the Liss Stimulator can improve the subjective&#xD;
           sensation of mouth dryness compared to a placebo device.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To characterize the effect of electrostimulation using the Liss stimulator on quality of&#xD;
           life compared to a placebo device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 treatment arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm I: Patients undergo placement of electrodes to the following acupuncture points:&#xD;
           stomach, liver, pericardium, small intestine, and large intestine. Patients then undergo&#xD;
           electro-stimulation of the acupuncture points using the Liss Stimulator for 20 minutes&#xD;
           once a day for 10 days and then 3 times a week for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arm II (placebo): Patients undergo placement of electrodes to the following acupuncture&#xD;
           points: stomach, liver, pericardium, small intestine, and large intestine. A device that&#xD;
           does not produce an electric current is placed over the electrodes for 20 minutes once a&#xD;
           day for 10 days and then 3 times a week for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients complete questionnaires, including the Brief Pain Inventory, the Xerostomia&#xD;
      Inventory, and a subscale of the University of Washington Head and Neck Symptom Scale, at&#xD;
      baseline, on days 5 and 10 of treatment, and at 1, 3, and 6 months after completion of&#xD;
      treatment. Sialometry (unstimulated and stimulated whole saliva measurement) is also&#xD;
      performed at the same time points.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed at 1, 3, and 6 months.&#xD;
