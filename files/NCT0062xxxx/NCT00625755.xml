      This study will look how using taken from your tumors and mixed with special immune&#xD;
      stimulating cells from another person's blood in given back to you in a series &quot;fusion cell&quot;&#xD;
      injections, will effect your body. The primary goal of the study is to see if giving the&#xD;
      experimental fusion cell injections is safe. We will also be looking to see what effect the&#xD;
      experimental treatment as on your immune system and whether it has an effect on your cancer.&#xD;

      Patients undergo tumor aquisition and short-term tumor cell cultures are established.&#xD;
      Leukopheresis is performed monocyte-derived DC are generated ex-vivo by standard culture&#xD;
      techniques, utilizing GM-CSF and Il-4. PEG fusions are generated, and following irradiation,&#xD;
      the vaccine is frozen. The thawed vaccine is administered SC into a single site every three&#xD;
      weeks. Each study is examining a dose-escalating strategy based apon the number PEG-fused&#xD;
      generated from the PEG process that expressed both tumor cell and DC markers as determined by&#xD;
      immune staining.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient must be _&gt; 18 years of age&#xD;
