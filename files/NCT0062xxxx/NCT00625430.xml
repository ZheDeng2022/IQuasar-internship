    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability of a&#xD;
      gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy for prostate cancer. FP253 contains an ovine&#xD;
      atadenovirus that expresses the E. coli enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) under&#xD;
      the control of a prostate-directed promoter. PNP converts systemically administered&#xD;
      fludarabine (the prodrug) into 2-fluoroadenine (the active agent) at the site where FP253 has&#xD;
      been administered (the prostate). This localized conversion is expected to provide&#xD;
      organ-targeted chemotherapy that should reduce the systemic side effects associated with&#xD;
      classical chemotherapy and also reduce the risk of debilitating damage to tissues surrounding&#xD;
      the prostate.&#xD;

      OBJECTIVES: The primary objective of this study is to determine the safety and tolerability&#xD;
      of FP253 for prostate cancer. FP253 contains an ovine atadenovirus that expresses the E. coli&#xD;
      enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) under the control of a prostate-directed&#xD;
      promoter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SUBJECT POPULATION: Up to eighteen male subjects (6 groups of 3 subjects) who have a&#xD;
      histological diagnosis of adenocarcinoma of the prostate, still have their prostate in situ,&#xD;
      have evidence of progressive disease despite continuous androgen deprivation therapy and who&#xD;
      meet all eligibility criteria, will be enrolled into this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STUDY DESIGN: This study is designed as an open-label, dose escalation trial in which each&#xD;
      patient in a cohort will receive a single defined dose. Subjects will be enrolled&#xD;
      consecutively into 6 escalating dose groups each of 3 subjects. Each subject will receive the&#xD;
      treatment as outlined in the protocol and will be followed up for a further 2 years at&#xD;
      regular intervals for life, as defined by current standard of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT: Subjects will be administered a single injection of FP253 followed by five doses&#xD;
      of Fludarabine phosphate as outlined in the Intervention section.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SAFETY PARAMETERS: Adverse events will be recorded and physical examinations, 12-lead ECG,&#xD;
      vital sign monitoring, urinalysis and collection of blood samples for pathology laboratory&#xD;
      tests will be performed at regular intervals during the study to monitor safety. The shedding&#xD;
      of viral vector will be monitored as per regulatory requirement until negative.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ADDITIONAL PARAMETERS: In order to assess any haematological or immunological effects of this&#xD;
      novel agent or any effects on tumour response and survival, the following will be assessed:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Biochemical and Haematological Markers: including Prostate-Specific Antigen,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Immunopathological Markers: including haematological markers and indicators of&#xD;
           cytotoxicity,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ECOG assessment,&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Assessment of disease progression and survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DATA ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarize key data including&#xD;
      demographics, vital sign measurements, ECG parameters, clinical laboratory parameters, immune&#xD;
      response, tumour response, adverse events and concomitant medication. The general strategy of&#xD;
      the safety analysis will be to examine the data summaries for any trends in safety parameters&#xD;
      across the dose levels. No formal hypothesis will be tested.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A formal data analysis will be performed after all subjects have completed the study period&#xD;
      (28 days) and an interim analysis will be performed after the first 3 dose cohorts have been&#xD;
      completed. For the first year, three monthly follow up reports will be produced followed by 6&#xD;
      monthly reports for the second year and a final follow up report when all subjects have&#xD;
      completed 2 years of follow up. Descriptive statistical methods will be used to summarise key&#xD;
      data including demographics, vital sign measurements, ECG parameters, clinical laboratory&#xD;
      parameters, immune response, tumour response, adverse events and concomitant medication. The&#xD;
      general strategy of the safety analysis will be to examine the data summaries for any trends&#xD;
      in safety parameters across the dose levels. No formal hypothesis will be tested.&#xD;
