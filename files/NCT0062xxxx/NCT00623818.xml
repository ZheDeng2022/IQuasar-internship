      This study, conducted at the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and at Walter Reed Army&#xD;
      Medical Center (WRAMC), will explore the phenomenon of phantom limb pain (a continued feeling&#xD;
      of pain in an amputated limb) and will use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to&#xD;
      investigate the effect of mirror therapy on phantom limb pain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Right-handed people between 18 and 75 years of age who are in the WRAMC Military Amputee&#xD;
      Research Program and healthy control subjects may be eligible for this study. Participants&#xD;
      undergo the following procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Amputees&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Questionnaires to assess strength of handedness and footedness and pain perception.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Mirror therapy for phantom limb pain five times a week for 4 weeks in 15-minute&#xD;
           sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  MRI and fMRI scans before starting mirror therapy, after 2 weeks of therapy and after 4&#xD;
           weeks of therapy. MRI uses a magnetic field and radio waves to image brain tissue. The&#xD;
           subject lies on a table that can slide in and out of the scanner (a metal cylinder). The&#xD;
           structural MRI scan lasts about 30 minutes. For fMRI, the subject performs tasks while&#xD;
           in the scanner in order to show changes in brain activity involved in performing those&#xD;
           tasks. Subjects are shown pictures of feet and other body parts, are asked to move their&#xD;
           feet, and receive tactile (touch) stimulation of the foot or other body parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control Subjects&#xD;
&#xD;
      One group of control subjects undergoes a single fMRI procedure. A second group of control&#xD;
      subjects undergoes the same sequence of three fMRIs over the same time period as the amputee&#xD;
      subjects. None of the control subjects undergo mirror therapy.&#xD;

      Objective: The aim of this study is to investigate phantom limb pain (PLP), cortical&#xD;
      reorganization and the modulation of PLP by visual input. Mirror therapy (viewing the intact&#xD;
      limb in a mirror so that it appears to be the missing limb) has been shown to reduce PLP.&#xD;
      This reduction demonstrates that vision can play a key role in modulating PLP. The study&#xD;
      proposed here will identify brain regions critical for the success of this therapy using&#xD;
      functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Individuals with unilateral amputation of individual limbs and at least&#xD;
      three episodes of PLP a week. Additionally, we will study amputees without PLP and healthy&#xD;
      control volunteer subjects with no limb amputations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: Amputee subjects with PLP will be scanned using fMRI while they undergo mirror&#xD;
      therapy for PLP. During fMRI scans subjects will see images of hands or feet, move their&#xD;
      limbs or experience tactile stimulation. Mirror therapy requires four weeks to be effective.&#xD;
      Amputee subjects will be scanned prior to starting therapy, two weeks after starting mirror&#xD;
      therapy and again after four weeks of mirror therapy. Mirror therapy sessions will be&#xD;
      conducted daily and subjects will also complete daily questionnaires (Visual Analogue Scale,&#xD;
      or VAS, and Short-Form McGill Pain Questionnaire or SF-MPQ) assessing their level of pain and&#xD;
      number of PLP episodes. Amputees without PLP and one group of healthy control subjects will&#xD;
      go through the same series of functional imaging scans over the same time period as the&#xD;
      amputee subjects, allowing us to identify brain changes that may be associated with repeated&#xD;
      scanning (e.g. due to practice of tasks) rather than resulting from the mirror therapy.&#xD;
      Another group of control subjects will be scanned once to identify particular brain regions&#xD;
      that might be involved in the integration of visual, motor and somatosensory information for&#xD;
      use in the analysis of the amputee subject data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome measures: Changes in fMRI activation during the course of mirror therapy will be&#xD;
      compared with data on the number of episodes of PLP, the average length of episodes, and the&#xD;
      average intensity of pain assessed using the VAS and SF-MPQ. Analyses will focus on cortical&#xD;
      regions known to be involved in visual, tactile and motor representations (including primary&#xD;
      motor cortex, primary and secondary somatosensory cortex and regions of visual cortex&#xD;
      selectively responsive during the viewing of body parts). Additional brain regions that might&#xD;
      be involved in integrating visual, motor and somatosensory information will be identified in&#xD;
      control subjects. Direct comparisons will be made between cortical regions (e.g.&#xD;
      somatosensory regions) involved in the representation of the amputated limb compared with the&#xD;
      intact limb and between amputee subject data and control subject data.&#xD;
