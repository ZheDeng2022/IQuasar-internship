      Background and rationale of the research&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy is an endoscopic examination whereby the physician can visually inspect the&#xD;
      interior lining of the colon. It is the most efficient and accurate means of identifying,&#xD;
      either directly or by biopsy, neoplasms in the large intestine and inflammatory processes,&#xD;
      infections, or ischemia involving the whole colon and the distal small intestines. In&#xD;
      addition, during the procedure, certain endoscopic treatments may be performed, such as&#xD;
      removal of precancerous polyps and cauterization of bleeding sites such as vascular&#xD;
      malformations by electrocoagulation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proper preparation of the bowel prior to colonoscopy is crucial to the quality of the&#xD;
      examination. Suboptimal preparation can adversely affect the ability of the examiner to&#xD;
      detect abnormalities in the small and large intestine or to carry out various endoscopic&#xD;
      treatments. In some cases, poor preparation may necessitate canceling the procedure and&#xD;
      rescheduling the patient for a repeated test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To properly clear the bowel, patients must strictly adhere to a special diet and drink a&#xD;
      laxative solution as directed. The physician selects the specific type of laxative solution&#xD;
      from among those that are currently available on the basis of the patient's age and&#xD;
      underlying diseases. At present, polyethylene glycol (PEG), owing to its good safety profile&#xD;
      and relative lack of complications, is recommended in older patients (65 years or more),&#xD;
      patients with hypertension or renal or cardiac insufficiency, and patients being treated with&#xD;
      diuretics and ACE inhibitors. However, a major disadvantage of PEG is its difficulty of use,&#xD;
      which involves bad taste and drinking 3 liters within a short period of time on the day&#xD;
      before the examination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several recent studies in the medical literature have reported that in ambulatory patients,&#xD;
      dividing the oral laxative solution into 2 doses taken at different times is more effective&#xD;
      than drinking the whole amount in one session. On the basis of these findings, and given that&#xD;
      the quality of the bowel preparation is known to be poorer in hospitalized than in ambulatory&#xD;
      patients, we sought to determine if dividing the laxative dose will yield better results in&#xD;
      hospitalized patients as well. It should be noted that laxative solutions constitute the most&#xD;
      accepted method of preparing the bowel for colonoscopy and that in the present study, the&#xD;
      sole difference from standard practice was the method of administration, namely a single or a&#xD;
      split dose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the study The purpose of this study is to compare the effectiveness (quality of bowel&#xD;
      cleansing) and ease of use (patient satisfaction) of two methods of administration of a&#xD;
      precolonoscopy PEG solution in hospitalized patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Prospective, comparative, randomized&#xD;
&#xD;
      End points:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary - Cleanliness of the bowel, as determined by the examiner, and ease of use, as&#xD;
      determined by a patient satisfaction questionnaire in the two study arms Secondary - Effect&#xD;
      of external factors (demographic parameters, length of hospitalization, procedural diagnosis)&#xD;
      on the quality of the bowel preparation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample: Four hundred hospitalized patients scheduled for a colonoscopy examination as&#xD;
      part of their in-hospital work-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria: Age 18-80 years; ability to understand and complete the questionnaires;&#xD;
      ability to participate in all stages of the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria: Previous colon surgery, previous endoscopic procedures under full&#xD;
      anesthesia, known sensitivity to the PEG solution, terminal renal or cardiac insufficiency,&#xD;
      inability to sign the informed consent form Colonoscopy: All patients will perform the&#xD;
      precolonoscopy bowel preparation by one of two methods, according to the study design,&#xD;
      followed by colonoscopy at the Gastrolenterology Institute of Rabin Medical Center&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Demographic questionnaire - age, sex, weight, height, years of education Patient satisfaction&#xD;
      questionnaire - ease of preparation and related symptoms In addition, physicians will rate&#xD;
      the degree of bowel visibility after the procedure on a standard scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study sample will include hospitalized patients scheduled for colonoscopy. The physicians&#xD;
      conducting the research will obtain informed consent from all candidates for the study prior&#xD;
      to their enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At onset of the study, the participants will complete a demographic questionnaire in the&#xD;
      presence of a member of the research team. Items will include age, sex, height, weight, and&#xD;
      years of education.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study participants will be randomly divided into 2 groups. Group 1 will receive the&#xD;
      precolonoscopy PEG solution in a single dose of 3 liters in the evening preceding the test.&#xD;
      Group 2 will receive half the dose (1.5 liters) of the identical solution in the evening&#xD;
      preceding the test and the other half (1.5 liters) on the morning of the test. The&#xD;
      randomization will be performed at the Gastroenterology Institute. The secretary of the&#xD;
      Institute will then inform the nurses/attendants in the various hospitalization departments&#xD;
      which of the two procedures to apply to each individual patient. Before the procedure, the&#xD;
      patients will complete a demographic questionnaire in the presence of a member of research&#xD;
      team. The physician performing the colonoscopies will be blinded to the group allocation.&#xD;
      After completing the colonoscopy, the physician will rate the quality of the bowel&#xD;
      preparation in the patient's medical file according to the Aronchick scale, as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Score Description 0 - excellent More than 95% of the intestines visible&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. - good Large amount of transparent fluid requiring suction; more than 90% of intestines&#xD;
           visible&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. - fair Semisolid stool requiring suction/flushing; more than 90% of intestines visible&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. - poor Semisolid stool difficult or impossible to remove; less than 90% of intestines&#xD;
           visible&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. - failed Repeated test required&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure, study participants will be asked to rate their satisfaction with the&#xD;
      ease of use of the bowel preparation and the severity of symptoms related to it (e.g.,&#xD;
      stomach pain, nausea) on a VAS scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Colonoscopy method:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the time of referral for colonoscopy, patients will receive a preliminary explanation of&#xD;
      the test, of the alternative examinations currently available, and of any possible&#xD;
      complications of the test. On the day of the colonoscopy, after receiving additional&#xD;
      explanations from the attending gastroenterologist, patients will be asked to sign an&#xD;
      informed consent form. The colonoscopy examination will be performed with patients lying on&#xD;
      their left side; a sedative will be administered intravenously. During the procedure, the&#xD;
      patient may feel cramping and discomfort from the infusion of air into the colon. The&#xD;
      duration of the examination will about 30 minutes, depending on the structure of the colon,&#xD;
      the amount of visibility consequent to the bowel preparation, and the degree of patient&#xD;
      cooperation; the last two factors are essential for the success of the procedure. The&#xD;
      endoscopic device will be carefully cleaned and sterilized between examinations in accordance&#xD;
      with routine practice at our institute and accepted standards in developed countries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      On the basis of reported means and standard deviations in the medical literature, assuming a&#xD;
      75% compliance rate and type 1 error (α) of 0.05, a study sample of 400 hospitalized patients&#xD;
      will yield a statistical power of more than 80%. The sample will be divided into two&#xD;
      treatment groups using the computerized Research Randomizer 2007 (http://www.randomizer.org/)&#xD;
      Independent t test will be used to compare means of continuous variables between the two&#xD;
      groups, and chi-square test will be used to compare proportions. Nonparametric Mann-Whitney&#xD;
      test will be used to analyze the level of preparation and bowel cleanliness, ranked on an&#xD;
      ordinal scale, between the groups. All test will be two-sided; statistical significance will&#xD;
      be set at p&lt;0.05. All analyses will be performed with SPSS software, version 15.&#xD;
