&#xD;
          -  Sinus bradycardia (resting heart rate &lt; 50 bpm) secondary to intrinsic conduction&#xD;
             system disease; Patients with sinus bradycardia secondary to pharmacologic treatment&#xD;
             may enroll if withdrawal of the treatment results in normalization of the resting&#xD;
             heart rate to within normal limits;&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Screening QTc &gt; 470 msec, or previous history of QTc prolongation while taking other&#xD;
