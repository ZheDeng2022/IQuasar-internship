    <textblock>
      Gabapentin is a medicine that has been used in adults (but not yet in children) to treat pain&#xD;
      after surgery. In children it has been used for many years to treat other conditions and has&#xD;
      been shown to be very safe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Removal of tonsils is a common operation with each child experiencing a similar pattern of&#xD;
      pain; this makes it good for looking at the effect of pain relieving medicines. In our study&#xD;
      each child will get the same operation and medicines, as they would have normally. Before the&#xD;
      operation and in a random way, half will get gabapentin and half will get the same syrup but&#xD;
      with no gabapentin. Afterwards we will record how much pain the children have and how much of&#xD;
      our standard medicine is needed to make them comfortable. We expect both of these results to&#xD;
      be lower in the half who received gabapentin. We will also record the amount and type of&#xD;
      unwanted effects, both from the gabapentin and from any other pain relief medicines.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Tonsillectomy is one of the most commonly performed children's surgeries and produces a&#xD;
      consistent pattern and intensity of pain in the recovery period. These qualities make this&#xD;
      surgery ideal for the investigation of pain relieving medications. Adequate analgesia for&#xD;
      tonsillectomy in the perioperative period presents a challenge to the anesthetist because&#xD;
      opiates, which provide the most effective analgesia, are associated with a high incidence of&#xD;
      nausea and vomiting, respiratory depression, and sedation. These effects make recovery from&#xD;
      tonsillectomy particularly hazardous in children with Obstructive Sleep Apnea Syndrome (OSAS)&#xD;
      (the primary indication for tonsillectomy or adenotonsillectomy) thus alternatives to opiates&#xD;
      have been sought. Gabapentin is a drug with an extensive safety record in the treatment of&#xD;
      children's seizures, and chronic pain syndromes. Recently studies have demonstrated new modes&#xD;
      of action for this medication, both directly on pain and in increasing the efficacy of&#xD;
      conventional opiate (morphine) pain relieving medications. As such it may have role in the&#xD;
      relief of acute pain. We hypothesize that given preoperatively as a single dose; gabapentin&#xD;
      will reduce postoperative pain and opiate requirement in children undergoing tonsillectomy.&#xD;
      Randomization will follow a computer generated random pattern with 14 patients in each group&#xD;
      (placebo or gabapentin). Pain and sedation will be recorded as will the incidence of&#xD;
      vomiting, dizziness and pruritis. Pain will be assessed using the Coloured Analogue Scale and&#xD;
      sedation with the University of Michigan Sedation Scale. The time to first oral intake of&#xD;
      fluids will also be recorded. All recordings will be made at 5-minute intervals from time of&#xD;
      extubation (time = 0) and will be made by an independent blinded recovery nurse. Subjects&#xD;
      will stay in the PACU for a minimum of one hour from time zero, and will only be discharged&#xD;
      to the Surgical Daycare Unit at a point after this when two successive pain measurements&#xD;
      demonstrate a score of 3 or less. In the Surgical Daycare Unit pain assessment will continue&#xD;
      at intervals of 30 minutes to a total time of 4 hours from time zero and will be recorded by&#xD;
      a member of the research team blinded to nature of premedication. A telephone interview will&#xD;
      be scheduled with the subject's parents at 24 hours from time zero.&#xD;
