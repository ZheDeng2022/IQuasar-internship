      Cholera is an important public health problem worldwide, remaining endemic in most of the&#xD;
      developing world at the same time causing outbreaks in areas where lapses in sanitation&#xD;
      occur. In 2005, 131 943 cholera cases and 2272 deaths were reported to the World Health&#xD;
      Organization (WHO) with more countries reporting cholera outbreaks. Overall, this represents&#xD;
      a 30% increase in the number of cases reported compared to 2004. The cholera case fatality&#xD;
      rate during that year was 1.72%; however, recent outbreaks in West Africa resulted in&#xD;
      case-fatality rates of as high as 12% [1, 2]. These figures are believed to be underestimates&#xD;
      and that as much as 120 000 deaths due to cholera are estimated to occur each year [3]. Aside&#xD;
      from this high mortality, cholera outbreaks cause economic and social disruptions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The states of West Bengal in India together with neighboring Bangladesh have been considered&#xD;
      by many as the &quot;homeland of cholera&quot;. In India, 4695 cases of cholera were reported to the&#xD;
      WHO [1] with states such as West Bengal, Maharashtra, Andra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka&#xD;
      and Delhi long been reporting outbreaks [4]. Although no country-wide data is available from&#xD;
      Bangladesh, a 4 - year surveillance in 4 different geographical areas in Bangladesh reveal&#xD;
      that cholera is widely distributed even in an area with no reported outbreaks for 10 years&#xD;
      [5]. Cholera in these 2 countries affects all age groups, with the youngest age group being&#xD;
      the most affected. In Kolkata, children &lt;5 years of age had a 30% higher risk of having&#xD;
      cholera compared to older individuals [6] and in Bangladesh, 53% of 5670 cholera-infected&#xD;
      patients in the 4-year surveillance were children &lt;5 years of age [5]. Further analysis of a&#xD;
      3 year prospective surveillance of cholera in Kolkata shows that infants less than 2 years of&#xD;
      age had a cholera incidence rate of 4.20 per 1000 person-years whereas the over-all rate in&#xD;
      the study population was 1.41 per 1000 person-years (Data on file).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Provision of safe water and food, establishment of adequate sanitation, and implementation of&#xD;
      personal and community hygiene constitute the main public health interventions against&#xD;
      cholera. These measures cannot be fully implemented in the near future in most&#xD;
      cholera-endemic areas. A safe, effective, and affordable vaccine would be a useful tool for&#xD;
      cholera prevention and control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considerable progress has been made during the last decade in the development of new&#xD;
      generation oral vaccines against cholera. These have already been licensed in some countries&#xD;
      and are now being considered for wider public health application. The World Health&#xD;
      Organization recently recommended that the newer generation cholera vaccines be considered in&#xD;
      certain endemic and epidemic situations, but indicated that demonstration projects are needed&#xD;
      to provide more information about the costs, feasibility, and impact of using these vaccines&#xD;
      [7].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A killed oral cholera vaccine (Dukoral™) has long been available internationally, however its&#xD;
      2-dose schedule, the use of a buffer and the cost of the vaccine have impeded its use in&#xD;
      public health settings. A live oral vaccine, CVD-103 HgR (Orochol™), although internationally&#xD;
      licensed is currently not available in the market. This vaccine is only available for use in&#xD;
      children older than 6 years old and adults. Despite the immunogenicity and efficacy in&#xD;
      challenge studies in North American volunteers [8], in a field trial of this vaccine in an&#xD;
      endemic area in Indonesia, no protective efficacy was detected during the period of&#xD;
      observation [9].&#xD;
&#xD;
      A need exists for an improved cholera vaccine that is more thermostable and may be used in&#xD;
      endemic countries in younger age groups. This new generation oral cholera vaccine must be&#xD;
      administered in a single-dose regimen, be thermostable, confer high grade long-term&#xD;
      protection and may be given to children below 2 years of age through mass immunization&#xD;
      campaigns or through the expanded programme on immunization (EPI). In the Diseases of the&#xD;
      Most Impoverished Programme (DOMI) of the IVI, Peru-15 was identified as the most promising&#xD;
      of all the vaccine candidates. It is a live oral attenuated cholera vaccine derived from V.&#xD;
      cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain that was first isolated in Peru in 1991 [10]. This has the&#xD;
      advantage of being given in a single dose and of having the same biotype as the current&#xD;
      pandemic strain (biotype El tor), unlike CVD-103 HgR which is a classical biotype. Peru-15&#xD;
      has been attenuated by several genetic modifications and deletions. By the deletion of the&#xD;
      ctx A and the rtxA genes, it has been rendered unable to encode for cholera toxin subunit A&#xD;
      and RTX toxin making it non-toxigenic and by insertion of the cholera toxin B gene to the&#xD;
      recA gene, it enabled the strain to produce cholera toxin B. This insertion has inactivated&#xD;
      the recA gene, and this together with the deletion of the attRS1 sequences, has decreased the&#xD;
      ability of the strain to integrate exogenous DNA making it non-recombinational. Lastly, by&#xD;
      the absence of the potentially inflammatory flagella it has been rendered non-motile [10,&#xD;
      11]. In addition, Phase I and II studies have been performed in North American volunteers&#xD;
      where it was found to be safe and immunogenic [11-12]. Furthermore, the vaccine strain&#xD;
      isolated from the stools of volunteers retained its non-motile characteristic. In a challenge&#xD;
      study among North American volunteers, Peru-15 provided 100% protection against moderate and&#xD;
      severe diarrhoea, and 93% against any diarrhoea [13].&#xD;
&#xD;
      This vaccine underwent phase I and II studies in a cholera-endemic area in Dhaka, Bangladesh&#xD;
      in three age groups: adults aged 18 - 45 years, children aged 2 - 5 years and infants aged 9&#xD;
      - 23 months [14, 15]. In these studies, a 2 x108 CFU dose of the vaccine was shown to be safe&#xD;
      and able to elicit vibriocidal responses among all age groups. 75% of adults, 84% of children&#xD;
      aged 2-5 years and 70% of infants aged 9-23 months developed a 4-fold rise from baseline in&#xD;
      their vibriocidal titres. Only 1 of 20 adults and 8 of 140 children who received vaccine&#xD;
      excreted the vaccine strain up to 4 days after vaccination. Analysis of the strains isolated&#xD;
      revealed that the strains remained unchanged in phenotypic and genotypic properties after&#xD;
      passage in the stool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To date, the vaccine has been tested on more than 400 volunteers. The freshly harvested&#xD;
      product, tested on 23 volunteers and the frozen lyophilized preparation, tested on 381&#xD;
      volunteers were both shown to be safe and immunogenic in all age groups. The most frequently&#xD;
      reported adverse events were gastrointestinal symptoms (diarrhea, nausea, abdominal cramping,&#xD;
      gas, decreased appetite) and headache and in controlled studies were reported in similar&#xD;
      frequencies in subjects who received Peru-15 and placebo. The optimal dose for healthy adult&#xD;
      travelers was a single, oral dose of 1 x 108 CFU. The study in Bangladesh further confirmed&#xD;
      that a 108 dose was safe and immunogenic in all age groups including infants among residents&#xD;
      of a cholera endemic area.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Avant Immunotherapeutics Inc., manufacturers of Peru-15, are in the process of reformulating&#xD;
      the vaccine with the long-term stabilizing ability of trehalose in order to make Peru-15 more&#xD;
      thermostable at elevated temperatures, i.e. 2-8ºC. If this reformulation is proven as safe&#xD;
      and at least as immunogenic as the previous version, then this will make vaccine storage&#xD;
      easier and more easily deployable in field conditions in Africa, in refugee settings and in&#xD;
      endemic countries in South Asia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The International Vaccine Institute (IVI) through the Cholera Vaccine Initiative (CHOVI)&#xD;
      together with Avant Immunotherapeutics Inc., manufacturers of the Peru-15 vaccine, have&#xD;
      negotiated an agreement that allow clinical trials on this reformulated vaccine to be&#xD;
      performed in 2 cholera-endemic countries - India and Bangladesh. This will eventually enable&#xD;
      licensure and facilitate the international use of this vaccine by obtaining a WHO&#xD;
      recommendation for its global use. This single dose vaccine may easily be used in endemic&#xD;
      countries and deployed at times when outbreaks are likely to occur. Furthermore, this vaccine&#xD;
      may potentially be used in infants and young children who have the highest risk of cholera,&#xD;
      potentially being included as part of the EPI in endemic areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The previous formulations of the vaccine were shown to be safe and immunogenic in all age&#xD;
      groups, including infants, in a cholera endemic area [12 - 15] and efficacious in preventing&#xD;
      cholera diarrhea in healthy adult volunteers [13]. In view of this, the current dose of up to&#xD;
      109 of the current formulation will be directly tested among infants.Data regarding the&#xD;
      safety and immunogenicity of the trehalose-reformulated Peru-15 vaccine among infants need to&#xD;
      be confirmed in order to pave the way for the possible use of this vaccine in cholera-endemic&#xD;
      areas where infants and children are most at risk. Furthermore, if this vaccine will be used&#xD;
      in the context of the EPI to be given together with measles vaccine, it would be important to&#xD;
      determine if immune interference exists between these 2 live attenuated vaccines.&#xD;
