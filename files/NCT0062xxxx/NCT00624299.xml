      The surgery to correct leg &amp; foot deformities in children is a lengthy, &amp; sometimes,&#xD;
      difficult procedure. Metal frames are attached to the leg and / or foot and over a period of&#xD;
      time the frame is manipulated to obtain the corrected position. During this period the&#xD;
      muscles &amp; skin become very tight which causes pain &amp; may pull the joint out of position. When&#xD;
      this happens it is sometimes necessary to stop the treatment before the best position is&#xD;
      obtained. This means that not only is the child left with an inadequate result but that&#xD;
      further surgery is required in the future.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the tension could be removed whilst the treatment is underway this would reduce the pain,&#xD;
      the possibility of joint damage &amp; potentially allow a more satisfactory to be obtained&#xD;
      without the need for further surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Botulinum toxin or Botox, as it is commonly called, has the potential to temporarily reduce&#xD;
      the tension in the muscles without causing permanent damage.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Excessive soft tissue tension (i.e.. tight muscles and associated tissues) is the most&#xD;
      limiting factor in lengthening and correction of limb length deficiency. Bone lengthening is&#xD;
      achieved by surgically breaking the bone and with the use of an extending device, commonly&#xD;
      placed on the outside of the limb, the bones ends are distracted. One millimetre a day is&#xD;
      commonly the amount of distraction, however the soft tissue increases in length at a slower&#xD;
      pace than the bone which leads to soft tissue tension.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Excessive soft tissue tension leads to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Soft tissue contractures temporary or permanent short muscles and tendons&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Joint subluxation or instability joints which slip out of line and are loose&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pain&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Loss of function inability to move joints properly and difficulty walking This puts the&#xD;
           joint in a very vulnerable situation and increases the possibility of subluxation. A&#xD;
           similar problem arises during tibial lengthening, when the ankle takes up an equinus&#xD;
           position (foot pointing down and in). Both deformities reduce the functional ability of&#xD;
           the child and risk the joint becoming permanently damaged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increasing pain levels accompany these deformities leading to a greater reluctance to comply&#xD;
      with treatment or rehabilitation. The lack of joint mobility has further detrimental effect&#xD;
      on the limb as it becomes weak and stiff.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These events become a vicious cycle which is difficult to resolve without further&#xD;
      intervention. When soft tissue tension is becoming a problem, i.e. pain levels are increasing&#xD;
      and difficult to control, or the joint is under threat of instability, the first course of&#xD;
      action is to slow or stop the lengthening for a few days which allows the soft tissue tension&#xD;
      to decrease. The drawback with this is the potential for the bone ends to start fusing and&#xD;
      prevent further lengthening once the process is resumed. To re start the process means the&#xD;
      child has to have a further general anaesthetic to enable the bone to be re osteotomised (re&#xD;
      broken).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Online Form 6 Some groups of children who undergo lengthening are more susceptible to soft&#xD;
      tissue tension than others and therefore prophylactic surgical measures are employed. In&#xD;
      anticipation of the soft tissue tension muscles known to create problems are commonly&#xD;
      selected for surgical releases. This has been shown to be an effective method for reducing&#xD;
      the effects of the tension but it is not without its problems. Releases done at the time of&#xD;
      surgery may heal before the lengthening is complete and may need to be repeated. Releases&#xD;
      cause trauma to the muscle or tendon which then heals by scar tissue, a structure known to be&#xD;
      less pliable than specialised muscle or tendon tissue. Regaining long term function can be&#xD;
      compromised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Temporarily reducing soft tissue tension during the lengthening phase of treatment which has&#xD;
      no long term consequences would be an ideal situation. Botulinum toxin has the ability to do&#xD;
      this. Paley (2004) used Botulinum toxin as an adjunct to or in place of soft tissue release&#xD;
      during femoral lengthening and noted that it seemed to reduce muscle spasm and pain in&#xD;
      patients. Unfortunately this was not supported by any form of evaluative research.&#xD;
