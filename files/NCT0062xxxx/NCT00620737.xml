          -  Subject has &quot;stable&quot; restrictive burn scar of a jointed area that restricts range of&#xD;
             motion (ROM) of the affected joint by greater than or equal to 20% and that is no&#xD;
             deeper than the fascia (i.e., underlying structures including ligament, tendon,&#xD;
             muscle, and bone must not contribute to the restriction)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subject agrees to maintain any current physical therapy regimen for the duration of&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Subjects for whom a skin biopsy cannot be collected&#xD;

             Danlos syndrome&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active systemic infection as shown by any one of the following: symptoms, fever and/or&#xD;
             an elevated white count (subjects who present with an active systemic infection may be&#xD;
             enrolled and biopsied after the infection has resolved)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Requires chronic antibiotic or steroidal therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any conditions that are considered by the Investigator to be contraindications to&#xD;
