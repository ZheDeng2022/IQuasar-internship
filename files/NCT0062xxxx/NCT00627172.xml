    <textblock>
      Multislice CT angiography is a novel but already established and widely used in diagnosing&#xD;
      coronary artery disease (CAD). It is very reliable in ruling out hemodynamically significant&#xD;
      narrowings in coronary arteries (Negative predictive value). However, it may overestimate the&#xD;
      severity of the stenoses in up to 30% of the coronary artery lesions (positive predictive&#xD;
      value 70%). However, when coupled with a functional or flow-sensitive diagnostic test, such&#xD;
      as PET perfusion or coronary doppler ultrasonography, one can assume that even the PPV may be&#xD;
      as high as 95 %. Despite this assumption, there's no scientific evidence to support use of&#xD;
      such hybrid multi-modality tests at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesis is that improving the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive&#xD;
      diagnosis of coronary artery disease will decrease the proportion of patients that need&#xD;
      catheter angiographies. The avoidance of these unnecessary invasive procedures will improve&#xD;
      patients´ quality of life and may even redirect health care resources in a more efficient&#xD;
      way.&#xD;

      Coronary MDCTA (multi-detector CT angiography) is a novel but already established and&#xD;
      widespread diagnostic method to diagnose coronary artery disease. When performed with a&#xD;
      64-detector (slice) CT, its strength is an excellent negative predictive value, NPV (98%).&#xD;
      Specificity (86%) is good but the positive predictive value (PPV) is only moderate (70%).&#xD;
      This is due to the ability of MDCTA to detect even minor vessel wall changes before they are&#xD;
      functionally significant, and the tendency of CT to overestimate the volume of dense&#xD;
      calcifications. However, when coupled with a functional or flow-sensitive diagnostic test,&#xD;
      such as PET perfusion or coronary doppler ultrasonography, one can assume that even the PPV&#xD;
      may be as high as 95 %. Despite this assumption, there's no scientific evidence to support&#xD;
      use of such hybrid multi-modality tests at present.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our hypothesis is that improving the diagnostic accuracy of non-invasive diagnosis of&#xD;
      coronary artery disease will decrease the proportion of patients that need catheter&#xD;
      angiographies. The avoidance of these unnecessary invasive procedures will improve patients´&#xD;
      quality of life and may even redirect health care resources in a more efficient way.&#xD;
