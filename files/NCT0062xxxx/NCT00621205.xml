  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Lifestyle and genetic factors interact in the development of obesity and the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. The molecular mechanisms underlying the beneficial dietary modifications are,&#xD;
      however, unclear. We aimed to examine the effect of the long-term 30 moderate weight&#xD;
      reduction on gene expression in adipose tissue (AT) and to identify genes and gene clusters&#xD;
      responsive to treatment and thereby likely contributing to the development of the metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome. Thus, randomized controlled and individualized weight reduction and physical&#xD;
      exercise intervention was conducted. In the WR group, glucose metabolism improved that was&#xD;
      not seen in other groups. Moreover, an inverse correlation between the change in SI and the&#xD;
      change in body weight was found (r =-0.44, p=0.026). Down-regulation of gene expression&#xD;
      (p&lt;0.01) involving gene ontology groups of extracellular matrix, cell death was seen. Such&#xD;
      changes did not occur in the other groups.&#xD;

      The objective of the study is to examine the expression of genes and gene regions involved in&#xD;
      obesity, insulin resistance and lipid metabolism. We aim to identify new genes which are&#xD;
      involved in the development of metabolic aberrations characteristic of metabolic&#xD;
      syndrome/type 2 diabetes. Obesity and type 2 diabetes are increasing medical and public&#xD;
      health problems globally. Low HDL cholesterol and elevated triglyceride concentrations, and&#xD;
      altered cholesterol metabolism are common in these states. More knowledge is urgently needed&#xD;
      of the role of genetics in obesity, insulin resistance and abnormal lipid metabolism and&#xD;
      their mutual relationship. This would enable the early detection of subjects at increased&#xD;
      risk of developing obesity and the common abnormalities related to it, i.e. insulin&#xD;
      resistance and abnormal lipid metabolism, as well as identification of subjects with&#xD;
      genotypes associated with increased risk for above mentioned metabolic states and&#xD;
      atherosclerotic vascular diseases and decreased responsiveness to conventional treatment.&#xD;
      Because both weight loss and regular physical exercise result in substantial changes in&#xD;
      glucose, insulin and lipid metabolism, studies aiming to explore the function of relevant&#xD;
      genes are highly interesting. In this study, gene expression will be measured in adipose&#xD;
      tissue and leucocytes before and after weight loss or period of regular physical exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Originally, the Genobin study included 75 middle-aged (mean age 60±7 years) overweight or&#xD;
      obese (mean BMI 32.9±2.8 kg/m2) men and women with impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma&#xD;
      glucose concentration 5.6-7.0 mmol/l) or impaired glucose tolerance (2-hour plasma glucose&#xD;
      concentration 7.8-11.0 mmol/l and fasting plasma glucose &lt;7.1 mmol/l) and two additional&#xD;
      features of metabolic syndrome according to the Adult Treatment Panel III criteria [49] (for&#xD;
      details see [50]). Subjects were randomized to one of the following groups: weight reduction&#xD;
      (WR) (n=28), aerobic exercise training (n=15), resistance exercise training (n=14) or control&#xD;
      group (n=18). Subjects were matched for age, sex and the status of glucose metabolism. In&#xD;
      addition, 11 normal-weight subjects (mean age 48±9 years, mean BMI 23.7±1.9 kg/m2) were&#xD;
      recruited. The intervention was performed in accordance with the standards of the Helsinki&#xD;
      Declaration. The Ethics Committee of the District Hospital Region of Northern Savo and Kuopio&#xD;
      University Hospital approved the study plan, and all participants gave written informed&#xD;
      consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the beginning of the study and after 9-11 months the following measurements were&#xD;
      performed: plasma/serum concentrations of glucose, insulin, total and lipoprotein lipids,&#xD;
      free fatty acids, non-cholesterol sterols, glycerol, leptin, adiponectin, ghrelin, tumor&#xD;
      necrosis factor α, and C-reactive protein, waist and hip circumferences, body composition and&#xD;
      resting energy expenditure. A DNA sample were drawn and an adipose tissue biopsy was&#xD;
      performed. A frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test (FSIGT) was performed to&#xD;
      assess insulin sensitivity and secretion. Given biochemical measurements were performed also&#xD;
      at 3 months.&#xD;
