      The purposes of this study include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the change in clearance of topotecan and topotecan lactone between day&#xD;
           1 and day 14 for patients receiving treatment with p.o. topotecan and p.o.&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide x 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the correlation between the activity of CYP3A4, as measured by the 14C-&#xD;
           Erythromycin Breath Test (ERMBT), and topotecan/topotecan lactone clearance for patients&#xD;
           receiving treatment with p.o. topotecan and p.o. cyclophosphamide x 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Determination of the response rate to oral cyclophosphamide and oral topotecan in&#xD;
           recurrent and/or refractory pediatric solid tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Obtain additional safety data for the chemotherapy regimen, p.o. topotecan and p.o.&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide x 14 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Report the frequency of severe toxicities associated with the level of CYP3A4 activity,&#xD;
           as measured by the ERMBT, for patients receiving treatment with p.o. topotecan and p.o.&#xD;
           cyclophosphamide x 14 days.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Upon obtaining informed consent, patients will begin two courses of oral cyclophosphamide and&#xD;
      topotecan x 14 days. During the first of two courses, patients will perform the&#xD;
      14C-Erythromycin Breath Test and have topotecan pharmacokinetics performed on day 1 and 14.&#xD;
      The subjects will also have various medical tests and procedures performed that are part of&#xD;
      regular cancer care which include: Medical history and physical examination to be done&#xD;
      weekly, blood tests to be done weekly, heart and kidney function tests, various scans to be&#xD;
      done after two courses of treatment, and a pregnancy test for females of childbearing age to&#xD;
      be done prior to starting treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients may continue to receive additional courses of oral cyclophosphamide and topotecan&#xD;
      provided that they do not experience tumor progression or intolerable side effects.&#xD;
