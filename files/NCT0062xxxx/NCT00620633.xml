  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will test the safety of giving you specialized white cells from your donor. They&#xD;
      are called WT1 sensitized T cells. They have been grown in the lab and are immunized against&#xD;
      a protein. The protein is called the Wilms' tumor protein, or WT1. Your leukemic cells make&#xD;
      too much of this protein. We want to learn whether the WT1 sensitized T cells will attack the&#xD;
      protein and kill the leukemia cells.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior to receiving treatment, some patients may undergo diagnostic and/or other&#xD;
             testing of their WT1 malignancies to determine if their disease is likely to respond&#xD;
             to treatment with WT1 specific T cells. Alternatively, blood samples may be required&#xD;
             for research tests to ascertain that the WT1-specific T-cells do not contain any cells&#xD;
             that could react against the patient. These patients will sign a separate&#xD;
             pre-treatment consent. If it is determined that a patient will qualify for and might&#xD;
             benefit from infusions of WT1 CTLs, he/she will go on to sign the standard treatment&#xD;
             consent for MSKCC IRB # 07-055 and be enrolled and treated on trial, if all other&#xD;
             eligibility criteria are met.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients eligible for this trial will include patients with a pathologically confirmed&#xD;
             diagnosis of leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) who, following an allogeneic&#xD;
             hematopoietic cell transplant, have relapsed with leukemia as demonstrated&#xD;
             morphologically on peripheral blood smear or bone marrow aspirate, or have recurrent&#xD;
             persistent minimal residual disease as demonstrated by at least 2 sequential testings&#xD;
             separated by at least 1 week demonstrating molecular evidence of residual leukemia or&#xD;
             MDS by FISH or cytogenetics. In addition, patients who are to receive an allogeneic&#xD;
             hematopoietic cell transplant as treatment for a leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome&#xD;
             that has an expected of risk of relapse post transplant of &gt;30% will be eligible to&#xD;
             have donor-derived WT1 peptide specific T cells generated prior to or at the time of&#xD;
             transplant for immediate use post transplant at such time that the patient is found to&#xD;
             have minimal residual disease or relapse. This includes patients with AML or ALL that&#xD;
             is either refractory to primary induction therapy or is at any stage later than first&#xD;
             relapse for AML or ALL, CML in a secondary chronic phase, accelerated disease or after&#xD;
             treatment for blast crisis or RAEB or RAEBT stages of MDS which have not responded to&#xD;
             or recurred following induction therapy. Furthermore, the patient's leukemic or MDS&#xD;
             blasts should be documented to express the WT1 protein detectable by&#xD;
             immunohistopathologic analysis of diagnostic paraffin embedded marrow biopsies,&#xD;
             obtained at diagnosis of relapse or be of a type known to commonly express WT1 at high&#xD;
             frequency. Expression of WT1 will be assessed by a modification of the technique of&#xD;
             Dupont and Soslow (36) and graded according to an adaptation of the German&#xD;
             Immunoreactive Score (IRS) which is the product of subscores for intensity of&#xD;
             immunoreactivity (0-3+) and distribution of immunoreactivity (0-4+). For this study,&#xD;
             leukemic blasts with IRS scores of 4-12 will be considered positive.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A pathologically confirmed diagnosis of leukemia or MDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have already received an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant and&#xD;
             have either a documented relapse of leukemia or MDS or have recurrent persistent&#xD;
             minimal residual disease as documented by at least 2 sequential testings, separated by&#xD;
             1 week, demonstrating molecular evidence of leukemia or MDS by FISH, cytogenetics or&#xD;
             fluorescent immunocytometry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are to receive an allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplant as treatment&#xD;
             for a leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome that has an expected risk of relapse&#xD;
             exceeding 30% will be eligible to have donor-derived WT1 peptide sensitized T cells&#xD;
             generated prior to or at the time of transplant for immediate use post transplant at&#xD;
             such time that the patient is found to have minimal residual disease or relapse. This&#xD;
             includes patients with:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALL, AML or MDS refractory to primary induction therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALL or AML at any stage later than 1° relapse&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CML in 2° or greater chronic phase after chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  CML in persistent accelerated phase or blast crisis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High risk MDS (RAEB and RAEB+) which has failed to respond or has recurred following&#xD;
             induction chemotherapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients' leukemia or MDS blasts must express the WT1 protein detectable by&#xD;
             immunohistopathologic analysis, or; if an adequate sample is not available for&#xD;
             testing, , must have a form of leukemia (ALL, AMLs other than M5) or MDS (2° MDS,&#xD;
             RAEB, RAEBT) known to over express WT1 in a high proportion of cases (&gt;60%). For&#xD;
             patients who develop a documented relapse of leukemia or MDS following transplant,&#xD;
             marrow aspirates should be evaluated for the proportion of blasts expressing WT1 by&#xD;
             immunohistology or FACS whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patient's hematopoietic cell transplant donor must consent to a 2 volume&#xD;
             leukapheresis or whole blood donations obtained at one phlebotomy which, will total&#xD;
             approximately 250 ml from which the WT-1 specific T cells to be used for adoptive&#xD;
             transfer will be generated&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  KPS or Lansky score &gt; or equal to 40&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Adequate bone marrow, renal and hepatic function at the time of treatment with WT1&#xD;
             specific T cells:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &gt; or equal to 1000/mm3, with or without G-CSF support.&#xD;
&#xD;
        This requirement may be waived if the patient has hematologic relapse of disease or if&#xD;
        patient has not yet recovered counts from chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Platelets &gt; or equal to 20,000/mm3. This requirement may be waived if patient has&#xD;
             hematologic relapse of disease or if patient has not yet recovered counts from&#xD;
             chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Creatinine &lt; than or equal to 2.0mg/dL&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  ALT, AST &lt;3.0 and total bilirubin all &lt; 2.5 x the institutional ULN&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  There are no age restrictions to this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with relapse also detected in the CNS may be treated on this protocol.&#xD;
             However, if intrathecal chemotherapy is being administered, T cells should not be&#xD;
             administered until at least 24 hours thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active (grade 2-4) acute graft vs. host disease (GVHD), chronic GVHD or&#xD;
             an overt autoimmune disease (e.g. hemolytic anemia) requiring high doses of&#xD;
             glucocorticosteroid (&gt;0.5 mg/kg/day prednisone or its equivalent) as treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with other conditions not related to leukemic relapse (e.g. veno-occlusive&#xD;
             disease or uncontrolled bacterial, viral or invasive fungal infection) which are also&#xD;
             life-threatening and which would preclude evaluation of the effects of a T cell&#xD;
             infusion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are pregnant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Donor Eligibility for Donation of Blood Lymphocytes for Generation of Donor-Derived&#xD;
        WT-1-Specific T Cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The eligibility criteria for the donor of blood to be used to generate WT1 peptide&#xD;
        sensitized T cells are:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The donor of WT-1 specific T. lymphocytes will be the same donor who provided the&#xD;
             patient's hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT). These normal donors will be&#xD;
             evaluated for evidence of prior sensitization to EBV by EBV serology. If the donor is&#xD;
             seropositive, and donor T cells are sensitized with the donor's WT-1 peptide- loaded&#xD;
             EBV transformed B cells, EBV-specific T-cells will also be generated from seropositive&#xD;
             donors generating WT-1 specific T-cells, and their growth and persistence post&#xD;
             transfer will be compared to that of the WT 1 specific T-cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Since the donor will have already undergone an extensive evaluation of his/her health&#xD;
             to ascertain eligibility for donating the patient's HSCT, re-evaluation for this blood&#xD;
             donation will be limited to a clinical history, physical examination and blood tests&#xD;
             to insure against any new condition which, in the opinion of the donor's physician,&#xD;
             preclude the donor from donating the blood required.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New health conditions which would exclude a transplant donor from a second blood&#xD;
             donation are limited, but include:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  New onset of an HIV infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other uncontrolled infection which could be transmitted to the patient by blood cells&#xD;
             and would place the patient at significant increased risk of severe morbidity or&#xD;
             death.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant anemia with Hgb &lt; than or equal to 10 gm/dl, persisting since the time of&#xD;
             the original transplant donation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of myocardial infarction or stroke since the time of HSCT donation which might&#xD;
             increase the risk of blood donation. A perspective donor will be informed of the&#xD;
             purposes of this study, and its requirements. If he/she consents, the donor will be&#xD;
             requested to provide two blood samplings.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  An initial donation of 25ml blood anticoagulated with heparin or ACD. This blood is&#xD;
             used to establish a B cell line transfused transformed with the B95.8 laboratory&#xD;
             strains of EBV. This EBV+ B cell line/ (EBVBLCL) will be used as an antigen-presenting&#xD;
             cell. When loaded with the pool of WT-1 pentadecapeptides, the EBVBLCL efficiently&#xD;
             sensitize T cells from the same donors against WT-1 as well as EBV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because the establishment and testing of an EBV transformed B cell line suitable for use as&#xD;
        an antigen-presenting cell require 4-5 weeks of in vitro culture, it is important that this&#xD;
        sample be obtained as early as possible for patients at risk for leukemic relapse, since&#xD;
        disease relapse most frequently occurs 2-6 months post transplant. Accordingly, this blood&#xD;
        sample should be obtained from the donor prior to donation of the hematopoietic progenitor&#xD;
        cell transplant whenever possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A donation of either a single standard 2 blood volume leukapheresis collected in&#xD;
             standard ACD anticoagulant. If it is impossible to collect a leukapheresis from some&#xD;
             of the donors, a unit of whole blood will be accepted by the AICTF (Adoptive Immune&#xD;
             Cell Therapy Facility manufacturing the clinical grade cell products under GMP&#xD;
             conditions in MSKCC) for the generation of limited number of T cells. This blood is&#xD;
             required for isolation of the T cells to be sensitized with the pool of WT-1 15-mers&#xD;
             loaded on autologous dendritic cells or autologous EBVBLCL, and propagated in vitro.&#xD;
             In addition, it is required to provide autologous feeder cells essential to sustain&#xD;
             T-cell growth without the risk of stimulating the growth of alloreactive T-cells&#xD;
             capable of inducing GVHD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  This donation of a leukapheresis or a unit of blood will be obtained from unrelated&#xD;
             HSCT donors at least 2 weeks after their donation of an HSCT, but soon thereafter as&#xD;
             possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
        In addition to providing written consent to these donations of blood for the purpose of&#xD;
        generating WT-1-specific T-cells for potential use in the treatment of recurrent leukemia&#xD;
        or persistent residual disease developing in the patient for whom the donor has provided an&#xD;
        HSCT, each donor will be informed of and asked to provide separate consent to each of the&#xD;
        following potential applications of the blood cells donated:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The use of a fraction of the cells isolated to generate immune T-cells specific for&#xD;
             viruses, such as Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) ,that can cause&#xD;
             lethal infections or lymphomas in transplant recipients. Such T-cells could then be&#xD;
             used, under separate protocols, to treat EBV-associated diseases (IRB 95-024) and/or&#xD;
             to treat CMV infections (IRB 05-065) in the patient receiving the donor's&#xD;
             hematopoietic progenitor cell transplant.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Consenting to this application will limit the number of blood donations that would be&#xD;
        required of any donor, since the white cells donated in a leukapheresis should provide&#xD;
        enough cells to grow immune T-cells against WT-1, EBV and CMV.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The donation of immune T-cells specific for EBV or CMV generated from the donor that are&#xD;
        not used for or required by the patient for whom they were originally intended to a bank of&#xD;
        immune cells that will be started and maintained cryopreserved under GMP conditions in the&#xD;
        Adoptive Immune Cell Therapy Facility at MSKCC, for potential use in the treatment of other&#xD;
        patients with EBV lymphomas or cytomegalovirus infections that express HLA alleles shared&#xD;
        by the donor.&#xD;
