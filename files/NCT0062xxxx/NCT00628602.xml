  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers (PUs) are a debilitating pathology resulting from pressure and shear in the&#xD;
      soft tissues of immobilized patients. In studies to date, BION neuromuscular stimulation has&#xD;
      been demonstrated to activate strong muscle contractions and to produce skeletal motion, with&#xD;
      associated increases in muscle bulk (hypertrophy), strength, and metabolic capacity, hence&#xD;
      counteracting the 3 major etiological factors in PU development (immobility, soft-tissue&#xD;
      atrophy and hypoxia).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study intends to use neuromuscular stimulation to both shift paralyzed subjects' weight&#xD;
      and build up gluteal muscle volume, in order to prevent recurrence of pressure ulcers. We&#xD;
      will implant BIONs alongside the already exposed inferior gluteal and sciatic nerves in&#xD;
      patients who are undergoing gluteal rotation flap surgery for PU reconstruction. The gluteal&#xD;
      rotation flap is a common reconstructive technique for treating PUs by bringing healthy&#xD;
      muscle and skin in to repair the deficient area, and to provide healthy tissue covering over&#xD;
      bony prominences. The implanted BIONs will enable us subsequently to stimulate the gluteus&#xD;
      maximus and hip extensor muscles. Outcome measures will include tissue health variables&#xD;
      (measured by clinical assessment, X-Rays, MRI and Sesta-MIBI SPECT perfusion scans), pressure&#xD;
      redistribution (measured by an array of pressure sensors), and recurrence rates over 12&#xD;
      months.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subject has had a spinal cord injury and has bilateral lower limb paralysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Subject cannot contract his/her gluteus muscle voluntarily.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Subject is between 18 and 70 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Subject sits in a wheelchair for at least 5 hours per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Attending physician considers the subject in general good health (other than SCI and&#xD;
             PU wound).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Subject has one or more PUs of Stage III or IV (according to National Pressure Ulcer&#xD;
             Advisory Panel Staging1).&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Subject is having a musculocutaneous (not cutaneous or fasciocutaneous) gluteal&#xD;
             rotation flap surgery for PU treatment in which the inferior gluteal pedicle and&#xD;
             sciatic nerve will be exposed but not damaged or sacrificed in any way (for any PU&#xD;
