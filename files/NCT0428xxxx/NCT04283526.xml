    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of both the combination of MBG453 and NIS793 with or without decitabine or&#xD;
      spartalizumab as well as single agent MBG453 and/or NIS793 single agent in myelofibrosis (MF)&#xD;
      subjects post treatment with a Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, combination therapies with novel agents including immune therapy will focus on&#xD;
      determining the promising combinations that provide acceptable safety and efficacy&#xD;
      independent of JAK inhibitors. Immune therapy combinations, such as MBG453 in combination&#xD;
      with NIS793, might offer the potential to target MF across genetic heterogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      recomended dose for each treatment combination (MBG453 + NIS793, MBG453 + NIS793 +&#xD;
      decitabine, and MBG453 + NIS793 + spartalizumab)&#xD;

      The purpose of this study is to investigate the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK) and preliminary&#xD;
      efficacy of both the combination of MBG453 and NIS793 with or without decitabine or&#xD;
      spartalizumab as well as single agent MBG453 and/or NIS793 single agent in myelofibrosis (MF)&#xD;
      subjects post treatment with a Janus Kinase (JAK) inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, combination therapies with novel agents including immune therapy will focus on&#xD;
      determining the promising combinations that provide acceptable safety and efficacy&#xD;
      independent of JAK inhibitors. Immune therapy combinations, such as MBG453 in combination&#xD;
      with NIS793, might offer the potential to target MF across genetic heterogeneity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to characterize the safety, tolerability and&#xD;
      recomended dose for each treatment combination (MBG453 + NIS793, MBG453 + NIS793 +&#xD;
      decitabine, MBG453 + NIS793 + spartalizumab).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary Objectives are: to evaluate the efficacy based on the revised International Working&#xD;
      Group for Myelofibrosis Research and Treatment (IWG-MRT) response criteria, to evaluate the&#xD;
      effect of each combination treatment in delaying progression of MF and estimate time to&#xD;
      progression free survival (PFS) event, and to characterize the PK profile of each treatment&#xD;
      arm Study is designed as a Phase Ib, multi center, open label study with multiple treatment&#xD;
      arms. The study is comprised of a dose evaluation/escalation part and a dose expansion part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MBG453 in combination with NIS793 will be explored as the initial backbone. As the study&#xD;
      progresses and based on emerging clinical data collected from this study, Novartis, in&#xD;
      agreement with the study Investigators will decide whether or not:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To proceed with any treatment arm that reaches recommended dose(s) to explore further&#xD;
           the safety, tolerability, and anti-tumor activity in the dose expansion part.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To add a third partner to comprise a triplet treatment arm in the dose&#xD;
           evaluation/escalation part (such as Treatment Arm 2 with decitabine or Treatment Arm 3&#xD;
           with spartalizumab.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To explore MBG453 single agent (Treatment Arm 4) and/or NIS793 single agent (Treatment&#xD;
           Arm 5) in the dose expansion part in order to assess the single agent contributions to&#xD;
           efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient population will include male or female adults (age 18 or over) with a confirmed&#xD;
      diagnosis of primary myelofibrosis (PMF) as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO)&#xD;
      criteria, or Post-Polycythemia Vera Myelofibrosis (PPV-MF), or Post-Essential Thrombocythemia&#xD;
      Myelofibrosis (PET-MF) based on the revised IWG-MRT) criteria, irrespective of JAK2 mutation&#xD;
      status and must have been treated with a JAK inhibitor for at least 28 days but no more than&#xD;
      6 months and experienced according to the Investigator suboptimal response defined by loss of&#xD;
      spleen response, or worsening of symptoms or discontinuation due to adverse events (AE).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis: the primary objective of the study is to characterize the safety and&#xD;
      tolerability of each combination and identify the recommended dose. The primary analysis will&#xD;
      be based on a Bayesian Hierarchical Logistic Regression Model (BHLRM) and summaries of other&#xD;
      safety, tolerabitliy endpoints. Efficacy will be assessed based on IWG-MRT. The study data&#xD;
      will be analyzed and reported based on all patients' data up to the time when 80% of the&#xD;
      patients have completed the follow-up for disease progression or discontinued the study for&#xD;
      any reason, and all patients have completed treatment and the safety follow-up period.&#xD;
