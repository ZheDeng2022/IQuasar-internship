  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Body image is one of the leading concerns for young people. Such concerns can have serious&#xD;
      health consequences, including unhealthy weight control and exercise behaviours, depression&#xD;
      and self-harm, low self-esteem and substance abuse. Emerging approaches for improving body&#xD;
      image are effective among adolescent girls and boys in the school setting. However, the vast&#xD;
      majority of trials in this area are conducted in high-income westernised countries, despite&#xD;
      body image concerns increasingly being recognised as a global concern. As such, it is&#xD;
      important to develop and disseminate interventions to promote positive body image among&#xD;
      adolescents in in low-to-middle income countries, too. 'Confident Me' has been found to be&#xD;
      effective in improving body image and related outcomes among adolescent girls and boys in the&#xD;
      UK up to 12-months later, and thus, could undergo adaptations for the Indian context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To conduct a small-scale acceptability study of a 'Confident Me', a body image&#xD;
           intervention, among 11-13-year olds in New Delhi, India, to understand its&#xD;
           acceptability, feasibility, and preliminary efficacy in a metropolitan area of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To refine 'Confident Me' based on the acceptability study, and to conduct a randomised&#xD;
           controlled trial to evaluate its efficacy at improving body image and related outcomes&#xD;
           among 11-13-year olds in New Delhi, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first aim will be fulfilled by recruiting two schools, of which one will be randomised to&#xD;
      the intervention and the other to the control arm. We will compare the body image and&#xD;
      well-being of students who take part in the programme to students in the control group. The&#xD;
      investigators will also gather in-depth feedback from students, teachers and the&#xD;
      interventionist via focus groups and interviews, in order to inform future improvement of the&#xD;
      programme. The second aim will be fulfilled by randomising six schools to either the revised&#xD;
      body image programme (3 schools) or the control arm (3 schools). Students will complete&#xD;
      questionnaire assessments of body image and well-being before and after the 5-week programme&#xD;
      period, and again 12 weeks later to assess longer-term benefits.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Body image is a significant and prevalent concern for adolescents in high-income countries&#xD;
      such as the UK, the USA, and Australia. For example, a study of 1,600 girls in the UK found&#xD;
      that four in ten 11-16-year-old girls are unhappy with the way they look. Similarly, a&#xD;
      nationally representative survey of nearly 22,000 young people in Australia found that 3 in&#xD;
      10 adolescent boys and girls are very concerned about their body image, and body image was&#xD;
      voted among the top three life concerns. The high prevalence of body image concerns among&#xD;
      adolescent boys and girls is worrisome, given their serious negative physical and&#xD;
      psychological health consequences. For example, body dissatisfaction is associated with&#xD;
      engagement in unhealthy weight loss behaviours and the onset of eating disorders, depression&#xD;
      and self-harm, substance use, and lower levels of academic engagement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is increasing recognition that body image is a global issue, as opposed to one&#xD;
      relegated to privileged adolescents in high-income Westernised countries. For example, in&#xD;
      India, 57% of adolescents aged 15-19 years report being concerned with their appearance.&#xD;
      Further, adolescent girls across different regions of India have expressed concerns in&#xD;
      relation to their weight and report dieting behaviours. Skin colour has also been indicated&#xD;
      as an additional source of appearance concern among young people in India. A large-scale&#xD;
      study among Asian, African, and South American countries, found that 19% of Indian&#xD;
      undergraduate students had used a skin lightening product in the previous 12 months, strongly&#xD;
      suggesting dissatisfaction with their natural skin tone, which may be pertinent to younger&#xD;
      groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Collectively, these findings indicate the importance of developing and disseminating&#xD;
      interventions to promote positive body image among adolescents in India. To date, only one&#xD;
      published study has investigated the effectiveness of a body image intervention delivered in&#xD;
      schools to adolescents in India. The results indicated the potential for media literacy to&#xD;
      improve body satisfaction among adolescent girls. While this study offers a promising first&#xD;
      step, more research is needed to understand the potential for school body image interventions&#xD;
      in India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of the present study is two-fold:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To conduct a small-scale acceptability study of a body image intervention among&#xD;
           11-13-year olds in New Delhi, India, to understand its acceptability, feasibility, and&#xD;
           preliminary efficacy in a metropolitan area of India.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To refine the body image intervention based on the acceptability study, and to conduct a&#xD;
           randomised controlled trial to evaluate its efficacy at improving body image and related&#xD;
           outcomes among 11-13-year olds in New Delhi, India.&#xD;
&#xD;
      1) The Acceptability Study&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two schools will be randomly allocated to receive the body image intervention or&#xD;
      classes-as-usual (control). Students will be assessed on body image and related outcomes at&#xD;
      baseline, post-intervention and 10 weeks follow-up, under standardised conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &amp; recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two co-educational secondary schools in Delhi, India, will be invited to take part in this&#xD;
      study. The collaborators in India will recruit the schools, and they will likely be schools&#xD;
      with which their institution has existing relations with. All students in classes 6-7&#xD;
      (equivalent of UK years 7-8; students aged 11-13) in each school will be invited to take&#xD;
      part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After expressing initial interest, each school will receive detailed information regarding&#xD;
      the aims, objective and requirements of the study to help them decide if they would like to&#xD;
      take part in this research project. In line with the ethical procedures adopted at the&#xD;
      collaborators' Indian universities, the school's head teacher will provide active informed&#xD;
      consent. Students will also be required to provide their consent before taking part. All&#xD;
      students will have the opportunity to opt out of the study, or withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      time, irrespective of head teacher consent. The Indian ethical procedures do not involve&#xD;
      asking parents to provide consent for their child's participation in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact numbers of students that take part in this research will depend on the number of&#xD;
      children enrolled in classes 6-7 at each school recruited, and the number that opt out during&#xD;
      the student consent process or are lost at follow-up due to moving schools, or being away&#xD;
      from school on the day the data is collected. However, given that this is a preliminary&#xD;
      acceptability study, both conditions (i.e., schools) will include 80 girls and 80 boys (160&#xD;
      participants overall) aged 11 to 13 years, which allows for 30% attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dove Confident Me&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dove Confident Me is a school-based intervention co-created by researchers at La Trobe&#xD;
      University (Australia), the Centre for Appearance Research UWE, teachers, students, and&#xD;
      education experts, and the Dove Self-Esteem Project (the social mission for personal care&#xD;
      brand Dove). The five-session intervention is aimed at adolescents aged between 11-13 years,&#xD;
      and targets recognised risk factors for body dissatisfaction, by addressing societal&#xD;
      appearance ideals (Session 1), media literacy (Session 2), appearance comparisons (Session&#xD;
      3), appearance-related conversations and teasing (Session 4), and promoting 'body activism'&#xD;
      (Session 5). The intervention consists of classroom-based discussion and small group&#xD;
      activities and uses audio-visual materials and worksheets to facilitate learning. The content&#xD;
      is based upon an evidence-based intervention previously trialled among adolescent girls&#xD;
      (Richardson and Paxton, 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A large-scale cluster randomised controlled trial (RCT) evaluating Dove Confident Me found it&#xD;
      to be effective in improving body image and related outcomes among adolescent girls and boys&#xD;
      in the UK up to 12-months later when delivered by teachers (Diedrichs et al., under review).&#xD;
      These findings present the longest improvements in body image observed in a teacher-led&#xD;
      intervention. However, the intervention has not undergone evaluation in low- and middle-&#xD;
      income countries, such as India, where body image concerns are also prevalent but the&#xD;
      rigorous development, evaluation, and dissemination, of evidence-based interventions is&#xD;
      lacking.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Investigators from the Centre for Appearance Research (CAR) based at the University of the&#xD;
      West of England will be leading the study remotely from Bristol, UK. CAR researchers will be&#xD;
      responsible for designing the study, analysing the data, and writing up the manuscript. They&#xD;
      will also be working with Indian collaborators who will be responsible for translating the&#xD;
      measures, recruiting the schools, collecting data, and delivering the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students aged 11-13 from a further two secondary schools in Delhi will be recruited, and&#xD;
      independent randomisation will be used to assign one school to the intervention condition,&#xD;
      and the other to the lessons-as-usual control condition. This will be done using freely&#xD;
      available computer software. Dove Confident Me (culturally adapted and translated into&#xD;
      Hinglish) will be delivered by counselling psychologists at Karma Centre for Wellbeing in&#xD;
      Delhi. The interventionists will be trained (in person) by two researchers from CAR on the&#xD;
      delivery of the intervention. Both of these researchers possess experience of delivering, and&#xD;
      training others to deliver, a range of body image interventions, including Dove Confident Me.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire comprising the self-report measures described below will be used to assess&#xD;
      the impact of the intervention on students' body image and associated risk factors. After&#xD;
      obtaining consent from the school head teachers, and the students, these measures will be&#xD;
      administered in the classroom to the 11-13 year old students at pre-intervention (1-2 weeks&#xD;
      before intervention delivery), immediately after intervention delivery (within 1 week of the&#xD;
      final session), and again at 10 weeks follow-up. The questionnaire will take students no more&#xD;
      than 20-25 minutes to complete. Students will complete questionnaires under standardised&#xD;
      conditions supervised by their teachers and trained research staff. Blinding of students,&#xD;
      teachers, and researchers is not possible due to the nature of the intervention. However,&#xD;
      risk of bias from teachers and researchers is minimised due to anonymous self-report&#xD;
      assessments. Risk of contagion is also minimised by randomising at the school level.&#xD;
      Participating schools will receive a £150 honorarium. This project has received ethical&#xD;
      approval from the University of the West of England's Faculty Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to assess the fidelity of the intervention manuals, all sessions will be&#xD;
      audio-recorded as well as observed by a researcher and rated based on adherence to lesson&#xD;
      plans. The interventionist and observing teachers also will be asked to complete a brief form&#xD;
      after each lesson stating which activities were completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess intervention feasibility and acceptability, phone calls will be conducted with the&#xD;
      interventionists after every session, to collect 'in-the-moment' feedback and suggestions for&#xD;
      improvement to the materials. At the conclusion of the intervention, interviews will be&#xD;
      conducted with the interventionists to explore their experience of delivering the body image&#xD;
      lessons. They will also be asked how well the content of the intervention was received, how&#xD;
      comfortable they felt delivering the session, and their suggestions to improve the&#xD;
      intervention further. Class teachers observing the lessons will also be interviewed and asked&#xD;
      similar questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-intervention questionnaire, students will be asked a series of questions to&#xD;
      assess their acceptability of the intervention. Students will indicate agreement with&#xD;
      different statements using a 5-point Likert scale, and will be asked three open-ended&#xD;
      questions: what they liked, what they did not like, and to list three things they learnt from&#xD;
      the intervention. Additionally, a sub-sample of students (approximately 10 girls, 10 boys) in&#xD;
      the intervention condition will also be invited to take part in single-gender focus groups,&#xD;
      in order to explore their opinions of the intervention. Permission to audio record the focus&#xD;
      groups and interviews will be sought from participants prior to commencing the discussions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The findings from this study will then be used to refine the intervention material further,&#xD;
      to ensure that it is adequately localised to the Indian context.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2) The Randomised Controlled Trial&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six schools will be randomly allocated to receive the body image intervention or&#xD;
      classes-as-usual (control). Students will be assessed on body image and related outcomes at&#xD;
      baseline, post-intervention and 12 weeks follow-up, under standardised conditions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants &amp; recruitment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six co-educational secondary schools in Delhi, India, will be invited to take part in this&#xD;
      study. The collaborators in India will recruit the schools, and they will likely be schools&#xD;
      with which their institution has existing relations with. All students in classes 6-8&#xD;
      (equivalent of UK years 7-9; students aged 11-14) in each school will be invited to take&#xD;
      part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After expressing initial interest, each school will receive detailed information regarding&#xD;
      the aims, objective and requirements of the study to help them decide if they would like to&#xD;
      take part in this research project. In line with the ethical procedures adopted at the&#xD;
      collaborators' Indian universities, the school's head teacher will provide active informed&#xD;
      consent. Students will also be required to provide their consent before taking part. All&#xD;
      students will have the opportunity to opt out of the study, or withdraw from the study at any&#xD;
      time, irrespective of head teacher consent. The Indian ethical procedures do not involve&#xD;
      asking parents to provide consent for their child's participation in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exact numbers of students that take part in this research will depend on the number of&#xD;
      children enrolled in classes 6-8 at each school recruited, and the number that opt out during&#xD;
      the student consent process or are lost at follow-up due to moving schools, or being away&#xD;
      from school on the day the data is collected. However, we will endeavour to include 125 girls&#xD;
      and 125 boys (250 participants overall) aged 11 to 14 years, which allows for 30% attrition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Students aged 11-14 from a further six secondary schools in Delhi will be recruited, and&#xD;
      independent randomisation will be used to assign three schools to the intervention condition,&#xD;
      and the other three to the lessons-as-usual control condition. This will be done using freely&#xD;
      available computer software. The refined programme will be delivered by counselling&#xD;
      psychologists at Karma Centre for Wellbeing in Delhi. The interventionists will be trained&#xD;
      (in person) by two researchers from CAR on the delivery of the intervention. Both of these&#xD;
      researchers possess experience of delivering, and training others to deliver, a range of body&#xD;
      image interventions, including Dove Confident Me.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A questionnaire comprising the self-report measures described below will be used to assess&#xD;
      the impact of the intervention on students' body image and associated risk factors. After&#xD;
      obtaining consent from the school head teachers, and the students, these measures will be&#xD;
      administered in the classroom to the 11-14 year old students at pre-intervention (1-2 weeks&#xD;
      before intervention delivery), immediately after intervention delivery (within 1 week of the&#xD;
      final session), and again at 12 weeks follow-up. The questionnaire will take students no more&#xD;
      than 20-25 minutes to complete. Students will complete questionnaires under standardised&#xD;
      conditions supervised by their teachers and trained research staff. Blinding of students,&#xD;
      teachers, and researchers is not possible due to the nature of the intervention. However,&#xD;
      risk of bias from teachers and researchers is minimised due to anonymous self-report&#xD;
      assessments. Risk of contagion is also minimised by randomising at the school level.&#xD;
      Participating schools will receive a £150 honorarium. This project has received ethical&#xD;
      approval from the University of the West of England's Faculty Research Ethics Committee.&#xD;

      plans. The interventionist and observing teachers also will be asked to complete a brief form&#xD;
      after each lesson stating which activities were completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To assess intervention feasibility and acceptability, interviews will be conducted with the&#xD;
      interventionists at the end of the programme to explore their experience of delivering the&#xD;
      body image lessons.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the post-intervention questionnaire, students will be asked a series of questions to&#xD;
      assess their acceptability of the intervention. Students will indicate agreement with&#xD;
      different statements using a 5-point Likert scale, and will be asked three open-ended&#xD;
      questions: what they liked, what they did not like, and to list three things they learnt from&#xD;
