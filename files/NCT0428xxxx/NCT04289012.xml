      The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infection in&#xD;
      patients with myocardial infarction (MI). This is performed to establish the feasibility of a&#xD;
      large trial examining whether systematic screening for and subsequent eradication therapy&#xD;
      significantly reduces the risk of hospitalization for upper gastrointestinal (GI) bleeding in&#xD;
      patients after MI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite progressively reduced mortality over the last decades, cardiovascular disease remains&#xD;
      the most common cause of death in both men and women in Sweden and the world. In addition to&#xD;
      early revascularization therapy, potent antithrombotic therapy is the basis for the reduction&#xD;
      in cardiovascular events, however, at a price of increased risk of bleeding, typically upper&#xD;
      gastrointestinal bleeding (UGIB) that result in substantial morbidity, mortality, and medical&#xD;
      care cost. Risk factors for UGIB include high age, male sex, renal failure, and a chronic&#xD;
      bacterial infection caused by Helicobacter pylori (Hp), the latter being the only treatable.&#xD;
      H. pylori infection causes both acute and chronic gastritis with ulcerative and erosive&#xD;
      lesions, peptic ulcer disease (both duodenal and gastric ulcers) and, less commonly, gastric&#xD;
      cancer and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Concomitant anticoagulation or&#xD;
      antithrombotic therapy aggravates the risk for bleeding, 2-fold with low dose aspirin, up to&#xD;
      7-fold with dual antiplatelet therapy, which today is standard treatment for 12 months post&#xD;
      MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-invasive screening for Hp can be performed easily with high accuracy by urea breath or&#xD;
      stool test. If found positive, eradication by triple therapy is well established and&#xD;
      recommended in risk individuals and believed to reverse the bleeding risk almost completely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hp screening in a current MI population has to our knowledge never been performed. Thus, it&#xD;
      remains unknown if systematic screening and subsequent eradication therapy significantly&#xD;
      reduces the risk of bleeding and improves prognosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HELicobacter Pylori Screening in Patients With Acute Myocardial Infarction (HELP) pilot&#xD;
      study is a multicenter, single group, open-label, clinical trial evaluating the prevalence of&#xD;
      Hp in patients hospitalized with acute MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All patients at participating sites during the inclusion period, with MI diagnosis defined as&#xD;
      International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes I21 or I22, and ageâ‰¥18 years, are&#xD;
      eligible for enrollment. After written informed consent eligible patients will be tested for&#xD;
      Hp infection with a bedside urea breath test (UBT) incorporated into MI routine care during&#xD;
      the hospitalization period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The UBT is based on the fact that Hp produces urease, which catalyzes the urea molecule into&#xD;
      ammonia (NH3) and carbon dioxide (CO2). After fasting for six hours prior to testing, the&#xD;
      patient swallows a C13 Urea tablet or solution and waits. After 10 minutes, the patient&#xD;
      exhales and breath is collected (tube, bag or breath card). The production of 13CO2 is&#xD;
      measured by a desktop analyzer (infrared mass spectrometry) and Hp diagnosis is made based on&#xD;
      previously established cut-off levels for Hp infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In patients tested positive, standard triple eradication therapy according to the national&#xD;
      society of gastroenterology guidelines will be prescribed at the caring physician's&#xD;
      discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control of successful Hp eradication therapy according to guidelines with either UBT or&#xD;
      Hp-antigen in feces 6 weeks after completed eradication therapy is recommended to the&#xD;
      treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Baseline characteristics and data about the in-hospital period (medication, procedures,&#xD;
      complications, laboratory results) will be collected from the Swedish Web System for&#xD;
      Enhancement and Development of Evidence-based Care in Heart Disease Evaluated According to&#xD;
      Recommended Therapies (SWEDEHEART) registry. For patients with acute MI, 106 variables are&#xD;
      registered, including demographics, risk factors, past medical history, medical treatment&#xD;
      before admission, electrocardiographic changes, echocardiography, biochemical markers, other&#xD;
      clinical features and investigations, medical treatment in hospital, interventions, hospital&#xD;
      outcome, discharge diagnoses and discharge-medications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective of this pilot study is to determine the prevalence of Hp infection in&#xD;
      patients with MI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to determine the feasibility of a large clinical trial on whether&#xD;
      systematic screening for Hp and subsequent eradication therapy in patients after MI reduces&#xD;
      UGIB and cardiovascular events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary objective is to map if the cardiovascular risk profile differs in patients that&#xD;
      are Hp negative and Hp positive, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All-cause death within 30 days will be obtained from the Swedish population registry,&#xD;
      including the vital status of all Swedish residence. SWEDEHEART is linked to the Swedish&#xD;
      population registry every month.&#xD;
