  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to determine a volunteer's gait objectively after surgery, when signed off&#xD;
      from the consultant and physiotherapist. This will identify any gait deficiencies using&#xD;
      simple traffic light coding, using GaitSmart, a CE Marked Class 1M Medical Device. Volunteers&#xD;
      chosen for the intervention programme, a set of exercises to improve gait deficiencies&#xD;
      identified in the report. All the exercises will be standard one already used within the NHS.&#xD;
      The objectives are to compare the outcomes from the intervention group with the Standard of&#xD;
      Care group, in terms of gait and PROMS and from this determine the clinical and economic&#xD;
      benefits of the intervention.&#xD;

      This study aims to determine a volunteer's gait objectively after surgery, when signed off&#xD;
      from the consultant and physiotherapist. This will identify any gait deficiencies using&#xD;
      simple traffic light coding, using GaitSmart, a CE Marked Class 1M Medical Device. All&#xD;
      volunteers in the intervention group will be provided with a copy of their report. Protocol&#xD;
      for SoC group SoC volunteers receive a GaitSmart test at their first appointment but are not&#xD;
      given their report. Questionnaires to record Volunteer reported outcome measures (PROMS)&#xD;
      include: Oxford hip score (OHS) or Oxford knee score (OKS) plus the Euroqol questionnaire&#xD;
      (EQ5D-5D) are completed. SoC volunteers return at week 15 for a second test but are not given&#xD;
      their report. Questionnaires to record Volunteer reported outcome measures (PROMS) include:&#xD;
      Oxford hip score (OHS) or Oxford knee score (OKS) plus the Euroqol questionnaire (EQ5D-5D)&#xD;
      are completed. Protocol for GaitSmart intervention group GaitSmart intervention group have&#xD;
      the procedure explained to them at the first appointment. All exercises have the volunteer&#xD;
      standing or sitting and are chosen from exercises already provided by the NHS. Each volunteer&#xD;
      will get a subset of these. The nurse will ensure volunteers can perform the exercises before&#xD;
      leaving the session. GaitSmart test performed at weeks 6, 9, 12 and 15. The report is&#xD;
      provided plus six personalised exercises. The nurse will check they are able to perform the&#xD;
      tests at each visit. Those not suitable will be struck off the list. Questionnaires to record&#xD;
      Volunteer reported outcome measures (PROMS) will be completed at weeks 6 and 15.&#xD;
