  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Our previous study demonstrated that anti-CD19 chimeric antigen receptor in piggyBac&#xD;
      transposon-engineered T cells have strong tumor-killing activity in vitro and therapeutic&#xD;
      effects in cell line-derived xenograft models, and no obvious side effects such as&#xD;
      neurotoxicity and cytokine storm occurred. Therefore, we want to evaluate the safety and&#xD;
      clinical effect of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells in clinical trials.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Using piggyBac transposon/transposase system to deliver genes into primary human T cells -&#xD;
      example expression of CD19 CAR.CARs specific to the human CD19 antigen were used. All CARs&#xD;
      contained the scFv against human CD19 (clone FMC-63), The third BBz CD28z CAR consisted of&#xD;
      the scFv linked to the intracellular domains of CD28, 4-1BB and CD3z through a CD28&#xD;
      transmembrane domain;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with relapsed/refractory CD19-positive B-cell Lymphoma or B-ALL can participate if&#xD;
      all eligibility criteria are met. All patients received chemotherapy with fludarabine and&#xD;
      cyclophosphamide before the infusion of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells.. After the infusion, subjects&#xD;
      will accept follow-up for side effects and effect of anti-CD19 CAR-T cells.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-up :&#xD;
&#xD;
      Safety and adverse events (safety and tolerability of anti-CD19 CAR-T cell therapy within 14&#xD;
      days): The number and severity of adverse events, an evaluation of their association with the&#xD;
      anti-CD19 CAR-T cell treatment, and the outcome of the adverse events. Possible adverse&#xD;
      events include cytokine release syndrome, hypotension, reversible neurotoxicity,&#xD;
      hypogammaglobulinemia, etc. CT was used to evaluate B-lymphoma lesions. B-ALL bone marrow&#xD;
      samples were collected by bone marrow aspiration to assess minimal residual disease. Flow&#xD;
      cytometry was used to detect proportion of T cells, B cells, and NK cells in the blood, and&#xD;
      expression of CD3, CD4, CD8, anti-CD19 CAR to determine the effect of anti-CD19 CAR-T&#xD;
      treatment. Plasma levels of the cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-α, IL-2, GM-CSF, IL-10, and IL-6&#xD;
      were also determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Overall survival and progress free survival were determined by the Kaplan-Meier method, using&#xD;
      all enrolled patients to determine overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study procedures may be performed while hospitalized.&#xD;
