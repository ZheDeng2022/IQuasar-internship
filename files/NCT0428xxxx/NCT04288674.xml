    <textblock>
      Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic diseases caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. Human are&#xD;
      accidental hosts, who acquired infections after exposition to animal urine, contaminated&#xD;
      water or soil, infected tissue. Incidence of invasive leptospirosis disease causing acute&#xD;
      kidney injury, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), myocarditis, hepatic dysfunction,&#xD;
      hemorrhage and multi-organ failure, is globally increasing and there have been frequent&#xD;
      outbreak situation throughout the world. Due to increasing outbreak situations and globally&#xD;
      chances in species distributions, a worldwide surveillance in epidemiology and species&#xD;
      distribution is urgently needed. The objective of the Leptospirosis Registry - LeptoScope is&#xD;
      to overcome the lack knowledge on epidemiology, clinical course, prognostic factors and&#xD;
      molecular characteristics for invasive leptospirosis disease.&#xD;

      Leptospirosis is a worldwide zoonotic diseases caused by pathogenic Leptospira spp. Human are&#xD;
      accidental hosts, who acquired infections after exposition to animal urine, contaminated&#xD;
      water or soil, infected tissue. During bacteremia, Leptospira spp. may lead to invasive,&#xD;
      deep-seated leptospirosis with infection of kidney, liver, heart and the central nervous&#xD;
      system. Although cleaned from blood and most tissue by immune response, Leptospira spp. can&#xD;
      persists and multiply in the tubuli of kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Incidence of invasive leptospirosis disease causing acute kidney injury, acute respiratory&#xD;
      distress syndrome (ARDS), myocarditis, hepatic dysfunction, hemorrhage and multi-organ&#xD;
      failure, is globally increasing and there have been frequent outbreak situation throughout&#xD;
      the world. In Europe, invasive leptospirosis disease is less common than in the tropical and&#xD;
      subtropical countries, however due to climate change incidence is rising, and there are&#xD;
      worry-some trends concerning chancing species distribution and multiple outbreak situations&#xD;
      throughout central Europe. Current treatment approaches consist of antibiotic therapies.&#xD;
      Additionally, salvage supportive treatment approaches of critical ill patients are common in&#xD;
      invasive leptospirosis disease requiring dialysis, hemodynamic support, mechanical&#xD;
      ventilation or even extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO). Furthermore, invasive&#xD;
      leptospirosis disease is associated with the development of chronic kidney disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to increasing outbreak situations and globally chances in species distributions, a&#xD;
      worldwide surveillance in epidemiology and species distribution is urgently needed.&#xD;
      Additionally, the examination of attributable mortality and costs analysis of invasive&#xD;
      leptospirosis disease will need to be studied on a multinational basis and therefore&#xD;
      LeptoScope will particularly use a matched case control design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of the Leptospirosis Registry - LeptoScope is to overcome the lack knowledge on&#xD;
      epidemiology, clinical course, prognostic factors and molecular characteristics for invasive&#xD;
      leptospirosis disease. Additionally, LeptoScope serves as a platform for monitoring&#xD;
      complications of invasive leptospirosis disease and outbreak situations.&#xD;
