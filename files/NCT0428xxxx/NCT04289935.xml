      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC) is common practice in the primary treatment of breast cancer,&#xD;
      leading to a complete pathologic remission (pCR) of the tumor in more than 50% in aggressive&#xD;
      tumor types. As NAC induces different response patterns, radiologic imaging is not&#xD;
      sufficiently accurate in predicting residual disease. Because of this uncertainty, surgery is&#xD;
      so far the only valid option to either ascertain complete response or to remove the complete&#xD;
      residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) with the possibility of obtaining tissue of the former tumor&#xD;
      center could contribute more reliably to detect any residual tumor or respectively, rule out&#xD;
      residual disease. Ultrasound (US) or mammographically (MG) guided VAB will be used in this&#xD;
      trial in order to detect residual tumor lesions in patients with radiological complete&#xD;
      response (rCR) after NAC. The investigators will evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the&#xD;
      post-NAC VAB sample in comparison to the sample obtained in open surgery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NAC), initially indicated to downstage tumors to achieve the option&#xD;
      of breast conserving surgery, has lately become common practice in the primary treatment of&#xD;
      breast cancer. The use of modern NAC regimens lead to a complete pathologic remission (pCR)&#xD;
      of the tumor in more than 50% in aggressive tumor types.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In general, it is difficult to predict pCR in the absence of invasive surgical techniques, as&#xD;
      it depends on several factors such as biological subtype, the used chemotherapy regimen and&#xD;
      anatomic stage. The most common imaging methods beside clinical examination are breast&#xD;
      ultrasound, mammography and breast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). As NAC induces different&#xD;
      response patterns, radiologic imaging is not sufficiently accurate in predicting residual&#xD;
      disease. Because of this uncertainty, surgery (and the standardized assessment of resected&#xD;
      tissue) is so far the only valid option to either ascertain complete response or to remove&#xD;
      the complete residual disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vacuum-assisted biopsy (VAB) with the possibility of obtaining tissue of the former tumor&#xD;
      center could contribute more reliably to detect any residual tumor or respectively, rule out&#xD;
      residual disease. Ultrasound (US) or mammographically (MG) guided VAB will be used in this&#xD;
      trial in order to detect residual tumor lesions in patients with radiological complete&#xD;
      response (rCR) after NAC. The investigators will evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of the&#xD;
      post-NAC VAB sample in comparison to the sample obtained in open surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the trial is to determine the diagnostic accuracy of the post-NAC VAB&#xD;
      in determining pCR compared to open surgery.&#xD;
