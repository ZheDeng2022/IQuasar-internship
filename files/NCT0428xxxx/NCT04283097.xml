  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1 study to evaluate the safety, pharmacokinetics(PK), and preliminary&#xD;
      clinical activity of KPG-818 as a single agent in adult subjects with selected hematological&#xD;
      malignancies, including multiple myeloma (MM), mantle cell lymphoma (MCL), follicular&#xD;
      lymphoma (FL), diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL), indolent lymphoma, adult T-cell&#xD;
      leukemia-lymphoma (ATL), or chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). This study will assist in&#xD;
      identifying appropriate, well tolerated doses that can be administered in subsequent studies&#xD;
      in subjects with selected hematological malignancies.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, multicenter, open-label, multiple-ascending dose study to evaluate the&#xD;
      safety, PK, and preliminary clinical activity of KPG-818 as a single agent in adult subjects&#xD;
      with selected hematological malignancies. The study center(s) will be in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After providing informed consent, subjects will be assessed for study eligibility at the&#xD;
      Screening visit (Days -28 to -1). Cohorts of 3 to 6 subjects per dose level will be given&#xD;
      escalating doses of KPG-818 during Days 1 to 21 of each 28-day cycle orally until progressive&#xD;
      disease (PD), unacceptable toxicity, the subject withdraws, or any other study withdrawal&#xD;
      criterion is met. The 4 planned dose escalation cohorts will be 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg followed&#xD;
      by dose expansion. The dose of KPG-818 for the first cohort will be 2 mg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will use an accelerated titration design (ATD) where the first two dose&#xD;
      levels will include one subject each. Subsequent dose levels will use a 3+3 approach to&#xD;
      establish a MTD. The first subject will receive the initial escalation dose level 5 mg/day&#xD;
      and be dosed on Day 1 to 21 over a 28-day treatment cycle, and in the absence of a DLT or&#xD;
      Grade 2 or greater study drug-related AE and after review of the data from the first full&#xD;
      cycle by the Safety Review Committee (SRC), the next subject will receive 10 mg/day followed&#xD;
      by review of the data by the SRC. Once 20 mg/day is reached, the enrolment will revert to a&#xD;
      standard 3+3 escalation design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If 1 or more Grade 2 or greater study drug-related AE is observed at dose levels 5 or 10&#xD;
      mg/day, two additional subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level, and dose escalation&#xD;
      reverts to a standard 3+3 escalation design. If 1 or more DLT is observed at dose levels of 5&#xD;
      or 10 mg/day, five additional subjects will be enrolled at the same dose level and dose&#xD;
      escalation reverts to a standard 3+3 escalation design (Table 3). Enrolment to 20 mg/day will&#xD;
      follow a standard 3+3 escalation design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The highest dose level which may be tested is 30 mg KPG-818. Dose escalation will follow a&#xD;
      3+3 design and dose-limiting toxicity (DLT) will be assessed during the 28-day DLT evaluation&#xD;
      period. The Safety Monitoring Committee (SMC) will be responsible for dose escalation&#xD;
      decisions, including whether to modify the dose escalation based on the DLT observations or&#xD;
      determine RP2D. Escalation to the Maximal Tolerated Dose (MTD) is not appropriate if activity&#xD;
      plateaus at a lower dose.&#xD;

In preclinical studies, KPG-818 demonstrated outstanding in vitro anti-inflammatory properties and broad spectrum of anti-proliferative activities as well as remarkable in vivo efficacy in animal models of multiple blood cancers.</description>
