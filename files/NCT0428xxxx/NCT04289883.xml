  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Based on in vitro studies identifying changes in food structures potential to delay digestion&#xD;
      as well as results from animal studies showing potential of these foods to decrease appetite,&#xD;
      nano-particulated whey protein and high molecular weight whey protein-alginate coacervates&#xD;
      were chosen to be investigated in humans. Thereby, the aim of this short-term study is to&#xD;
      investigate if nano-particulated whey protein has appetite reducing effects in humans&#xD;
      compared to non-particulated whey protein (Part 1) as well as if high molecular weight whey&#xD;
      protein-alginate coacervates have appetite reducing effects in humans compared to calcium&#xD;
      alginate (Part 2).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Based on animal studies in mice, nano-particulated whey protein and high molecular weight&#xD;
      whey protein-alginate coacervates are expected to have appetite reducing (and potentially&#xD;
      also other) effects, which potentially may be beneficial for body weight management. In order&#xD;
      to investigate these effects in humans, this study is divided into two parts (Part 1 and Part&#xD;
      2), of which the specific objectives are specified below:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1: The objective of this part of the study is to examine if nano-particulated whey&#xD;
      protein can reduce appetite compared with non-particulated whey protein.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2: The objective of this part of the study is to examine if high molecular weight whey&#xD;
      protein-alginate coacervates can reduce appetite compared to calcium alginate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A double-blind, randomised crossover design with four arms divided into the two parts will be&#xD;
      applied. After having successfully completed screening procedures, eligible participants will&#xD;
      be invited to two separate appetite probe days with particulated whey protein followed by at&#xD;
      least 14 days break followed by another two separate appetite probe days with the whey&#xD;
      protein-alginate coacervates. The appetite probe days must be separated by at least 7 days,&#xD;
      but there is no upper limit for days in between, as long as the participants remain weight&#xD;
      stable and do not change diet or physical activity level significantly. The study includes a&#xD;
      total of five visits to the study site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For standardisation, 48 hours before the appetite probe days, the participants will be asked&#xD;
      to consume a regular diet compliant to what they usually eat and no excessive alcohol&#xD;
      consumption (not above 5 units and no alcohol at all from 8 pm the night before the appetite&#xD;
      probe days) or intense physical activity is allowed. Within each part of the study, the&#xD;
      participants will be instructed to consume similar meals the evening before the appetite&#xD;
      probe days and the meal must be consumed at approximately the same time. The participants&#xD;
      will also be instructed to go to bed at the same time in the evening prior to the appetite&#xD;
      probe days. Additionally, the participants must arrive at the study facilities in the morning&#xD;
      after an overnight fast (from 10 pm) using non strenuous means of transportation.&#xD;
      Furthermore, over the course of the study (from screening (visit 1) to completion of the last&#xD;
      appetite probe day (visit 5)), the participants are not allowed to change body weight (Â±3&#xD;
      kg), diet or physical activity level (as judged by the sub-investigator). The participants&#xD;
      will be weighed and asked about compliance with additional standardisation criteria in a room&#xD;
      away from the other participants before initiating each appetite probe day. Possible&#xD;
      non-compliance with the standardisation will be judged whether to result in re-scheduling of&#xD;
      the visit or to be recorded as a protocol deviation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants arrive at the study facility in the morning. Compliance with standardisation is&#xD;
      controlled along with registration of possible adverse events and use of concomitant&#xD;
      medications. During the appetite probe days, participants are settled together in an open&#xD;
      office, where they are separated at individual tables. During the ad libitum lunch,&#xD;
      participants are settled into individual feeding cubicles, where they cannot see each other&#xD;
      and are instructed not to talk to each other.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VAS' will be completed for measurement of fasting levels of self-reported appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The test products will be provided as a standardised fixed breakfast and as a standardised&#xD;
      fixed mid-morning meal provided 3 hour and 1 hour prior to the ad libitum lunch,&#xD;
      respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Immediately before and after the test products and the ad libitum lunch and at 30 minutes&#xD;
      intervals, VAS' will be completed assessing self-reported appetite.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the ad libitum lunch, the participants will be free to leave the laboratory. They will&#xD;
      be provided with a snack box including a variety of foods to including a ready-to-heat dish&#xD;
      for dinner etc. providing approximately 10000 kJ. The participants will be instructed only to&#xD;
      consume foods and drinks (water excepted) from the snack box for the remaining of the days,&#xD;
      and to be focussed while eating and only eat until feeling comfortably full. The participants&#xD;
      will be instructed to complete a diary registering the time point of consumption of which&#xD;
      items from the snack box (and potential additional items). If consuming any foods or energy&#xD;
      containing drinks besides those provided in the snack box, the participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to register the type and amount consumed. Within the diary, the participants will&#xD;
      also be instructed to register the time of going to bed on the day of the appetite probe day.&#xD;
      At the second appetite probe day within each part of the study, the participants will be&#xD;
      instructed to go to bed at approximately the same time as registered at the first appetite&#xD;
      probe day within each part of the study. On the following day after each appetite probe day,&#xD;
      the participants will be instructed to hand in the leftovers from the snack box and the diary&#xD;
      at the research facility.&#xD;
