      An innovative methodology is developed to better understand parent-infant relationships.&#xD;
      RGB-D sensors (such as Microsoft Kinect) give us the opportunity of online skeleton&#xD;
      extraction based on the joints architecture of human bodies. These technologies provide&#xD;
      automatic quantitative information of dyadic play, in order to get micro and macro features&#xD;
      of the dynamic flow occurring during the interaction. This methodology looks at both&#xD;
      behavioral features and objective measurement of spatial proximity and variations during free&#xD;
      and structured interactions.&#xD;

      RATIONALE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children developmental outcomes are known to be shaped by the early context of care and&#xD;
      caregiver-infant interaction: an early sensitive caregiving environment provides an optimal&#xD;
      emotional context for children's early brain maturation. Consequently, the multilayered and&#xD;
      complex interactional processes occurring between infants and their mothers is of vital&#xD;
      importance for healthy developmental trajectories. Although mother-infant communication is&#xD;
      expressed and regulated using multiple modalities, only few studies focused on the role of&#xD;
      body movements within the dyadic communication. Observational instruments - such as PICCOLO&#xD;
      (Parenting Interactions with Children-Checklist of Observations Linked to Outcomes) - are&#xD;
      useful to get the outstanding characteristics of the dynamicity and complexity of&#xD;
      parent-infant relationships, but advances in technology allows us to analyze the flow of&#xD;
      movements characterizing information exchanges in the bidirectional process of the&#xD;
      parent-infant relationship. Spatial proximity is a core aspect of early dyadic relationships.&#xD;
      The temporal and spatial reliability of automatic and computational methods, together with&#xD;
      the decreasing costs of technology, are paving the way to the intersection of behavioral and&#xD;
      technological techniques in both clinical and research fields. Nevertheless, to the best of&#xD;
      our knowledge, kinematic full skeleton registration of mother-infant interaction in a&#xD;
      free-play setting with children 18-36 months has not yet been explored both in at-typical and&#xD;
      atypical development dyads. Indeed, previous studies assessed social interactions using&#xD;
      automatic and computational methods, but mostly focusing on gesture and posture, gaze and&#xD;
      mimics, quantity of body, facial and hand movements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1: To identify spatial proximity features during free and structured dyadic&#xD;
      interaction of typical development dyads and its association with mother and infant&#xD;
      characteristics EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AIM 1: mother-infant dyads will be asked to play within a&#xD;
      specific perimeter that correspond to the detection area of Microsoft Kinect. The play&#xD;
      session is divided into 3 phases: (1) free play. Some standard toys are positioned on the&#xD;
      floor. (2) tower-task: mother and child are asked to play in order to build a tower with some&#xD;
      cubes. (3) Empathy task: the mother is asked to pretend to hurt herself until a &quot;stop&quot; signal&#xD;
      from the experimenter. Each session will be videotaped and data from Microsoft Kinect will be&#xD;
      detected. Mothers will be asked to answer some questionnaires and expert coders will do&#xD;
      behavioral coding with PICCOLO. Spatial proximity measures will be developed through&#xD;
      algorithms able to extract, from Kinect row data, measures of approaches and separations of&#xD;
      the dyad and mother and child's reciprocal contributions SPECIFIC AIM 2: to understand&#xD;
      differences regarding the use of spatial proximity and reciprocal contributions of mother and&#xD;
      infant both in typical and atypical dyads EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN AIM 2: children with&#xD;
      neurodevelopmental disabilities and their mothers will be asked to play in the same setting&#xD;
      explained in &quot;experimental design 1&quot;. Data and proximity patterns that will emerge from&#xD;
      typical development dyads will be compared to proximity patterns of atypical development&#xD;
      children dyads, in order to understand how neurodevelopmental disabilities affect&#xD;
      mother-infant interaction from a spatial and motor point of view.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIGNIFICANCE AND INNOVATION Although mother-infant communication is expressed and regulated&#xD;
      using multiple modalities, only few studies focused on the role of body movements and spatial&#xD;
      proximity within dyadic communication. This study wants to develop and test an innovative&#xD;
      methodology based on RGB-D sensors applied to the setting of free parent-infant interaction.&#xD;
      Automatic quantitative information of the dyad will provide micro and macro features of the&#xD;
      dynamic flow occurring during the interaction. Thus, automatic quantitative information will&#xD;
      supplement behavioral assessments, enriching these observations with objective measurement of&#xD;
      spatial proximity and variations during free and structured interactions.&#xD;
