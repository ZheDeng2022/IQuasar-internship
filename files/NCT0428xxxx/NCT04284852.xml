  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aims to evaluate the effects of niraparib in those who have received neoadjuvant&#xD;
      chemotherapy and subsequent interval debulking surgery, with or without hyperthermic&#xD;
      intraperitoneal chemotherapy, and would also explore if there are any biomarkers, other than&#xD;
      BRCA / HRD status and platinum sensitivity, that may help to identify those who may benefit&#xD;
      from PARPi especially those who are HRD negative.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite cytoreductive surgery and platinum-based chemotherapy, about 70% of patients with&#xD;
      advanced ovarian cancer recur in the first 2 - 3 years. PARPi has been shown to be prolong&#xD;
      survival in primary advanced ovarian cancer. However its role in neoadjuvant setting has not&#xD;
      been fully evaluated.&#xD;
