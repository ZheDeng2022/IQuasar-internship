    <textblock>
      This is an open-label phase II study assessing the activity of cabozantinib combined with&#xD;
      atezolizumab in patients with resectable muscle-invasive urothelial carcinoma who are&#xD;
      ineligible for cisplatin-based therapy or decline cisplatin-based therapy. Each cycle equals&#xD;
      21 days. The dose of atezolizumab is 1200 mg IV flat dose every 3 weeks (Day 1) plus&#xD;
      cabozantinib 40 mg orally daily (Day 1 through Day 21). Patients will receive three cycles of&#xD;
      treatment prior to cystectomy unless they discontinue treatment for unacceptable toxicity or&#xD;
      progressive disease by RECIST v1.1 or withdraw consent.&#xD;

             manifestation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Lesions invading or encasing any major blood vessels.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other clinically significant disorders that would preclude safe study participation.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Serious non-healing wound/ulcer/bone fracture.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Uncompensated/symptomatic hypothyroidism.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Moderate to severe hepatic impairment (Child-Pugh B or C).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Major surgery (eg, GI surgery) within 2 weeks before C1D1. Complete wound healing from&#xD;
             major surgery and from minor surgery (eg, simple excision, tooth extraction) must have&#xD;
             occurred prior to treatment. Subjects with clinically relevant ongoing complications&#xD;
             from prior surgery are not eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  For subjects with known QTcF of &gt; 500 ms, corrected QT interval calculated by the&#xD;
             Fridericia formula (QTcF) &gt; 500 ms per electrocardiogram (ECG) within 14 days before&#xD;
             first dose of study treatment. NOTE: If a single ECG shows a QTcF with an absolute&#xD;
             value &gt; 500 ms, two additional ECGs at intervals of approximately 3 min must be&#xD;
             performed within 30 min after the initial ECG, and the average of these three&#xD;
             consecutive results for QTcF will be used to determine eligibility.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence of bleeding diathesis or significant coagulopathy (in the absence of&#xD;
             therapeutic anticoagulation).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concomitant anticoagulation with coumarin agents (eg, warfarin), direct thrombin&#xD;
             inhibitors (e.g., dabigatran), direct factor Xa inhibitor betrixaban, or platelet&#xD;
             inhibitors (eg, clopidogrel). Allowed anticoagulants are the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Low-dose aspirin for cardioprotection (per local applicable guidelines) is&#xD;
                  permitted.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Low-dose low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are permitted. Prophylactic use of&#xD;
                  anticoagulants is allowed.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Therapeutic doses of LMWH or anticoagulation with direct factor Xa inhibitors&#xD;
                  rivaroxaban, edoxaban, or apixaban in subjects without known brain metastases who&#xD;
                  are on a stable dose of the anticoagulant for at least 1 week before first dose&#xD;
                  of study treatment without clinically significant hemorrhagic complications from&#xD;
                  the anticoagulation regimen or the tumor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Uncontrolled gross hematuria associated with clots per investigator's discretion.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Inability to swallow pills&#xD;
