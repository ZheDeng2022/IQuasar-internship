  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Activated clotting times (ACTs) are routinely measured throughout atrial fibrillation&#xD;
      ablations to monitor anticoagulation prior to and after heparin administration. Routinely,&#xD;
      ACTs are obtained from an arterial line established prior to heparin administration. With&#xD;
      technological advances, the cardiac intervention team is interested in eliminating the need&#xD;
      for arterial lines for noninvasive monitoring devices; eliminating arterial lines could&#xD;
      decrease the risk of bleeding, infection, and pain. Since procedural access requires femoral&#xD;
      vein catheterization, obtaining ACTs through the venous sheath would not pose additional&#xD;
      risks to the patient. In this study it proposed to draw paired arterial and venous ACT&#xD;
      samples in ablation procedures to compare the agreement between venous and arterial ACTs for&#xD;
      adequate patient treatment planning.&#xD;

      This project aims to establish a standardized procedure for venous ACT sampling during atrial&#xD;
      fibrillation ablation in 50 adults. Analyses will examine the relationship and agreement&#xD;
      between venous and arterial ACTs. It is anticipated that the standardized procedure could&#xD;
      eliminate the need for an arterial line for ACT measurement which would reduce patient risks&#xD;
      for bleeding, infection, and discomfort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients who are scheduled for for atrial fibrillation ablations will be invited to&#xD;
      participate in this project. An information sheet will be provided about the project to&#xD;
      potential participants. If the potential participant expresses interest, a study specific&#xD;
      consent consent will be obtained to allow the additional paired blood samples to be drawn&#xD;
      throughout the procedure. The additional blood volume to be drawn is expected to be less than&#xD;
      or equal to a teaspoon of venous blood. Participation will be completely voluntary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will undergo usual standard of care for the procedure, including usual arterial and&#xD;
      venous sheath/catheter insertions. After obtaining venous and arterial access, baseline ACTs&#xD;
      will be drawn using the outlined ACT sampling procedure. The ACT value for both arterial and&#xD;
      venous samples will be obtained using the standard procedure for Hemochron Signature Elite&#xD;
      point-of-care testing; this test uses less than 0.5 cc blood. ACT samples will be performed&#xD;
      at baseline (pre-heparin administration), every 30 minutes during the procedure (per standard&#xD;
      ACT monitoring protocol to obtain and maintain desired ACT), and at the end of procedure&#xD;
      prior to arterial and venous sheath removal. Time of procedure ranges from 2 to 4 hours and&#xD;
      may result in a minimum of 2 paired samples (pre and end) to a maximum of 9 paired samples&#xD;
      (pre, end, and every 30 minutes) per patient; this equates to an additional 1 cc to 4.5 cc of&#xD;
      additional blood for paired sampling per patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ACT arterial and venous sampling procedure: Using a stopcock at the nearest point of&#xD;
      insertion, withdraw 30 cc of blood in a syringe; turn the stopcock and remove 0.5cc of blood&#xD;
      for ACT testing; turn the stopcock to return the 30 cc blood and flush the line; remove the&#xD;
      syringe with the ACT sample and flush the line with saline, replace syringes for the next ACT&#xD;
      sampling process.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients undergoing atrial fibrillation ablations will continue to have Heparin dosed on the&#xD;
      arterial ACT sample results only per the standard of care. Heparin will not be administered&#xD;
      based on venous ACT levels obtained during this project. The purpose for paired sampling is&#xD;
      to verify that the proposed venous sampling method is accurate and provides an evaluable&#xD;
      sample to compare with the ACT sample results.&#xD;
