  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall goal of this investigation is to determine gut microbiome dependent and&#xD;
      independent impacts of pulse consumption on metabolic resilience and metabolic risk profiles&#xD;
      for type 2 diabetes (T2D) and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. Specifically, pulse crop&#xD;
      consumption has unrealized potential to fundamentally alter how the body responds to disease&#xD;
      promoting metabolic stresses of postprandial triglyceride and inflammation responses. The&#xD;
      specific objectives are to (1) Determine the impact of green lentil consumption on&#xD;
      postprandial triglyceride (TG) and inflammation responses to a high-fat meal challenge. (2)&#xD;
      Determine the extent to which the gut microbiome and changes in the gut microbiome induced by&#xD;
      pulse consumption influence health impacts (3) Measure metabolomic profiles to elucidate&#xD;
      underlying mechanisms linking pulse consumption to improved health. To achieve these&#xD;
      objectives investigators will determine the effects of green lentil on high impact risk&#xD;
      factors of large postprandial triglyceride excursions and inflammation, composition of and&#xD;
      changes in the gut microbiomes, and both gut and serum metabolomes in overweight/obese&#xD;
      (OW/OB) individuals with elevated risk. The 12-week intervention will consist of consumption&#xD;
      of 4.6 or 0 cups of pulses per week across 7 pre-made meals (matched for macronutrient&#xD;
      content (except fiber) provided to experimental and control groups. The following hypotheses&#xD;
      will be tested in the proposed investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: Lentil consumption lower postprandial TG and inflammation responses and improve overall&#xD;
      metabolic health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: Characteristics of the gut microbiome and changes in the gut microbiome induced by lentil&#xD;
      consumption substantially influence health impacts of pulse consumption.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: Features of the fecal and serum metabolomes distinguishing lentil and control treatments&#xD;
      correspond to metabolic pathways elucidating potential gut microbiome dependent and&#xD;
      independent mechanisms linking pulse consumption to improved health.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will utilize a parallel intervention of lentil versus macronutrient-matched&#xD;
      (not including fiber) control treatment for 12 weeks in OW/OB adults with demonstrated risk&#xD;
      for T2D and CVD. Experimental diets will be provided to participants in the form of pre-made&#xD;
      midday meals to exploit the second meal effect and lower caloric intake at the evening meal.&#xD;
      Pre- and post-intervention assessments will be made for the following variables: makeup of&#xD;
      the gut microbiome (microbial species and relative abundance), gut metabolome, postprandial&#xD;
      response of TG, inflammatory cytokines, and serum metabolome to a high-fat meal challenge&#xD;
      (established inflammation stimulus), fasting serum glucose, lipid, insulin, inflammation&#xD;
      markers and metabolome, blood pressure, and anthropometric measures including weight, body&#xD;
      composition, waist circumference, and quantity of visceral adipose tissue. Physical activity,&#xD;
      sedentary behavior, and habitual diet will be measured so that these variables can be used to&#xD;
      aid in our characterization of participants and aid in analysis and interpretation of data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Postprandial lipidemic and inflammation responses: High-fat meal challenges with 40 to 100 g&#xD;
      of dietary fat are an established laboratory test to measure both postprandial&#xD;
      triglyceridemic and inflammation responses. Investigators have used a 50 g dose of fat&#xD;
      delivered in the form of butter on toast on &gt; 50 individuals because this particular dose is&#xD;
      effective at discriminating between low versus high TG and inflammation responders. In brief,&#xD;
      participants will report to the laboratory after an overnight fast, an indwelling venous&#xD;
      catheter will be placed in an antecubital vein, and blood samples will be collected before,&#xD;
      and 1, 2, 4, and 6 hours following ingestion of the high-fat meal. Samples will be analyzed&#xD;
      in real time for TG (and full lipid panel plus glucose) using a clinical chemistry analyzer&#xD;
      (Piccolo xpress), while serum samples will be aliquoted and stored at -80 C until analysis&#xD;
      for inflammatory cytokines, metabolomics, and insulin. Investigators will measure&#xD;
      inflammatory cytokines (TNF-α, interleukin (IL)-1β, IL-6 IL-17, IL-23, and granulocyte&#xD;
      macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF)) using high-sensitivity Luminex multiplexing&#xD;
      technology (Bio-Rad Bio-Plex® 200 HTS) prepared by Millipore.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary intervention: Using methods established for an ongoing CRT with lentils,&#xD;
      investigators will prepare 7 meals per participant per week to deliver a dose of 4.6 or 0&#xD;
      cups of lentils per week for the experimental and control groups. Meals are matched for&#xD;
      macronutrient content (except for fiber), and ground turkey replaces lentils in the control&#xD;
      meals. Similar meals will be developed for black beans. Participants will be instructed to&#xD;
      consume food provided for their midday meal, and then to proactively reduce portion sizes and&#xD;
      to not eat beyond fullness at the evening meal. This strategy exploits the satiety effect of&#xD;
      pulses at the midday meal and the 'second meal effect' in which volitional consumption is&#xD;
      reduced at the next meal, the evening meal. Each participant will be surveyed once weekly to&#xD;
      determine whether they consumed the experimental meal that day, their perceptions of hunger,&#xD;
      fullness, satiety, and satisfaction with that day's meal (at 4:00 pm), and their&#xD;
      gastrointestinal comfort (level of bloating, flatulence, cramping, and comfort) throughout&#xD;
      the day (at 8:00 pm). This methodology has been successfully implemented in our ongoing study&#xD;
      to demonstrate that lentil meals are equally pleasing, produce greater satiety, and are&#xD;
      well-tolerated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gut microbiome analysis: Bulk DNA will be extracted from fecal samples using the Powersoil®&#xD;
      DNA Isolation Kit (Mo Bio Laboratories Inc.). DNA will be shipped overnight to the University&#xD;
      of Michigan, Center for Microbial Systems, for Illumina MiSeq amplicon sequencing of the 16S&#xD;
      V4 variable region. Raw sequencing reads will be processed and curated using the mothur&#xD;
      (v.1.39.5) software package, following the mothur MiSeq standard operating procedure,&#xD;
      potentially chimeric sequences will be identified and removed using the Uchime (v4.2.40)&#xD;
      algorithm, and taxonomic classifications will be assigned using the Bayesian classifier of&#xD;
      the Ribosomal Database Project, and operational taxonomic units (OTUs) will be assigned in&#xD;
      mothur using the VSEARCH distance-based clustering algorithm at the 97% sequence similarity&#xD;
      threshold.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metabolomic analysis: Samples will be analyzed by high resolution liquid chromatography mass&#xD;
      spectrometry (LCMS). Hydrophilic interaction chromatography (HILIC) and reverse-phase (RP)&#xD;
      columns will be used for deep coverage. Metabolite identification will use fragmentation&#xD;
      pattern matching, authentic standards and database matching with METLIN and the Human&#xD;
      Metabome Database (HDB). Novel features of significant interest will be characterized with&#xD;
      liquid chromatography mass spectrometry solid phase extraction nuclear magnetic resonance&#xD;
      (LCMS-SPE-NMR). Pathway analysis will use XCMS and mummichog.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dietary analysis. Long-term dietary habits may create adaptations that influence the response&#xD;
      to the short-term supplementation of Aronia and lentil. This study will use the most recent&#xD;
      version (2018) of the web-based Diet History Questionnaire (DHQ III), a food frequency&#xD;
      questionnaire designed for adults 19 and older, developed by staff at the Risk Factor&#xD;
      Monitoring and Methods Branch (RFMMB) of the NIH National Cancer Institute. The outputs of&#xD;
      the DHQ III include carbohydrate constituents, carotenoids and tocopherols, dietary&#xD;
      constituents from supplements, fats, fatty acids and cholesterol, macronutrients and energy,&#xD;
      minerals, protein constituents, and vitamins are dietary constituents and food groups&#xD;
      available in the DHQ III output files.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical activity and sedentary behavior monitoring: Participants will wear an Actical&#xD;
      omni-directional accelerometer during weeks 1 and 12 of the intervention to measure total&#xD;
      physical activity, time in low intensity activity, moderate to vigorous activity, and&#xD;
      vigorous activity, and sedentary activity in minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical analysis: H1 will be tested using two-sample t-tests to compare the difference&#xD;
      between pre- and post-intervention assessments. Using preliminary data for TG responses and&#xD;
      50% effect sizes consistent with published findings in animal models, it was estimated that&#xD;
      18-24 participants will be required per group to achieve power of 0.76 to 0.86 at alpha =&#xD;
      0.05. To test H2, investigators will identify changes in the gut microbiome using the methods&#xD;
      utilized in our preliminary research to identify characteristics of the gut microbiome that&#xD;
      differentiate low versus high TG responders, and then use regression analysis to determine&#xD;
      the level of variability in changes to the pulse and control treatments explained by changes&#xD;
      in relative abundance of gut microbial species. To test H3, investigators will identify&#xD;
      changes in the gut and serum metabolomes, and then determine the metabolic pathways&#xD;
      associated with the metabolomic changes to identify potential mechanisms underlying health&#xD;
      impacts of pulses.&#xD;
