  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disease that manifests itself as a&#xD;
      hypermetabolic response of skeletal musculature, in genetically susceptible patients, with&#xD;
      the inhalation of volatile halogenated anesthetics, depolarizing neuromuscular relaxants such&#xD;
      and, rarely, physical stressors such as intense exercise and heat stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HM diagnosis is based on the performance of two tests:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In vitro muscle contraction test (IVCT): it is the gold standard of the diagnosis of HM&#xD;
           in Europe.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pharmacogenetic study: about 50 genetic variants associated with HM have been described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It also has been described that B lymphocytes of patients with MH have metabolic alterations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective is to evaluate the association of disorders that occur with hypermetabolic&#xD;
      response of skeletal musculature and susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia (MH).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Malignant hyperthermia (MH) is a pharmacogenetic disease that manifests itself as a&#xD;
      hypermetabolic response of skeletal musculature, in genetically susceptible patients, with&#xD;
      the inhalation of volatile halogenated anesthetics, depolarizing neuromuscular relaxants such&#xD;
      and, rarely, physical stressors such as intense exercise and heat stroke.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Risk factors to present this disease are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  An adverse reaction to general anesthesia manifested as an unexplained increase in&#xD;
           carbon, dioxide production, tachycardia, temperature rise, muscle. stiffness,&#xD;
           rhabdomyolysis, disseminated intravascular coagulation or death, or both. During&#xD;
           anesthesia or within 60 minutes of treatment discontinuation.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Family history of unexplained perioperative death.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Postoperative rhabdomyolysis after clinical exclusion of other myopathies.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Stress rhabdomyolysis, recurrent or persistent rhabdomyolysis increased serum creatine&#xD;
           kinase concentration where no cause has been identified after neurological study&#xD;
           (idiopathic hyperCKemia).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Heat stroke by effort that requires hospital admission, where known predisposing factors&#xD;
           have been excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Other myopaties Extreme physical activity, as well as environments with high&#xD;
           temperatures favor the appearance of ischemia, anoxia and release of calcium from the&#xD;
           sarcoplasmic reticulum, thus increasing the risk of developing MH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are also other infrequent diseases in which there is a ryanodine canalopathy by a&#xD;
      mechanism similar to that seen in MH, but in cells of tissues other than skeletal striated&#xD;
      muscle; as well as some drugs and other rare diseases that may be related to MH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite the rarity of MH and given the severity of the disease clinic, it is mandatory to&#xD;
      explore possible risks in patients with hypermetabolic response of skeletal musculature due&#xD;
      to rare or trigger diseases (medications, drugs of abuse, exercise, extreme heat, others)&#xD;
      whose MH risk is not defined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although the standard method for the diagnosis of MH is the in vitro test for halothane&#xD;
      caffeine contraction (IVCT), it has been described that B lymphocytes of patients with MH&#xD;
      have metabolic alterations. Alto, there are about 50 genetic variants associated with MH that&#xD;
      have been described.&#xD;
