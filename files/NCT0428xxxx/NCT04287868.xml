      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      More than 30,000 cases of human papillomavirus (HPV) associated cancers occur annually in the&#xD;
      United States. When these cancers spread, they do not respond well to standard treatments and&#xD;
      are often incurable. Researchers want to see if a mix of drugs can help.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if a mix of immunotherapy drugs can shrink tumors in people with HPV associated&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People ages 18 and older with locally advanced or metastatic HPV associated cancer, such as&#xD;
      cervical cancers; P16+ oropharyngeal cancers; anal cancers; vulvar, vaginal, penile, and&#xD;
      squamous cell rectal cancers; or other locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (e.g.,&#xD;
      lung, esophagus) that are known HPV+ cancers&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be screened with:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  medical history&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  disease confirmation (or tumor biopsy)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  physical exam&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  body scans (CT, MRI, and/or nuclear)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  blood tests&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  electrocardiogram (to measure the electrical activity of the heart)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  urine tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get PDS0101 injected under the skin every 4 weeks for 6 doses. Then they&#xD;
      will get it every 3 months for 2 doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get M7824 by intravenous infusion every 2 weeks. For this, a needle is&#xD;
      inserted into a vein. The drug is given over a 1-hour period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get NHS-IL12 injected under the skin every 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will get the study drugs for up to 1 year. They will visit the NIH every 2&#xD;
      weeks. They will repeat the screening tests during the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      About 28 days after treatment ends, participants will have a follow-up visit or telephone&#xD;
      call. Then they will be contacted every 3 months for 1 year, and then every 6 months after&#xD;
      that, for the rest of their life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cervical cancer with prior pelvic radiation and boost brachytherapy will be&#xD;
      enrolled in a separate cohort to evaluate safety and preliminary evidence of efficacy...&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic or refractory/recurrent HPV associated malignancies (cervical, anal, oropharyngeal&#xD;
      cancers etc.) are poorly palliated by standard therapies. There is an unmet need for active&#xD;
      treatments for these tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a phase I trial of M7824 (NCT02517398) 15 out of 43 (34.9%) participants with HPV&#xD;
      associated malignancies had radiographic tumor responses according to RECIST 1.1 or iRECIST.&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the response rate observed with M7824 appears to be higher than single agent PD-1&#xD;
      inhibitors alone (15-20%), the majority of patients with these diseases still do not seem to&#xD;
      benefit from immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preclinical studies suggest that the use of a combination of multiple immunotherapy agents&#xD;
      may have improved anti-tumor efficacy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specifically, preclinical studies have shown that the combination of three immunotherapy&#xD;
      agents (1) a therapeutic vaccine against HPV positive cancers (PDS0101), (2) a bifunctional&#xD;
      fusion protein targeting PD-L1 and TGF beta (M7824), and (3) a tumor targeted immunocytokine&#xD;
      (NHS-IL12) produces greater anti-tumor activity than any single or dual combination of these&#xD;
      agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To evaluate the objective response rate (ORR) according to Response Evaluation Criteria&#xD;
      (RECIST 1.1) of the combination of (1) a therapeutic vaccine against HPV positive cancers&#xD;
      (PDS0101), (2) a tumor targeted immunocytokine (NHS-IL12) and (3) a bifunctional fusion&#xD;
      protein targeting PD-L1 and TGF beta (M7824) in subjects with checkpoint naive advanced HPV&#xD;
      associated malignancies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age &gt;= 18 years old.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with cytologically or histologically confirmed locally advanced or metastatic HPV&#xD;
      associated malignancies:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cervical cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
      P16+ Oropharyngeal cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anal cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vulvar, vaginal, penile, and squamous cell rectal cancers;&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors (e.g. lung, esophagus) that are known HPV+.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior first line systemic therapy is required unless the participant declines standard&#xD;
      treatment after appropriate counseling has been provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects must have measurable disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a phase I/II trial of combination immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial will be conducted using a Simon optimal two-stage design.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive HPV vaccine + NHS-IL12 + M7824.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first six participants will be evaluable for dose limiting toxicities (DLTs) and accrual&#xD;
      will only continue to 8 participants who have not been treated with checkpoint inhibitors if&#xD;
      less than 2 out of the first 6 participants experience a DLT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If three or more out of eight participants who have not been treated with checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors have objective responses accrual will be expanded to enroll 20 evaluable&#xD;
      participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with cervical cancer with prior pelvic radiation and boost brachytherapy will be&#xD;
      enrolled in a separate cohort to evaluate safety and preliminary evidence of efficacy.&#xD;

&#xD;
        EXCLUSION CRITERIA:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with prior investigational drug, chemotherapy, immunotherapy or any prior&#xD;
             radiotherapy (except for palliative bone directed therapy) within the past 28 days&#xD;
             prior to the first drug administration except if the investigator has assessed that&#xD;
             all residual treatment-related toxicities have resolved or are minimal and feel the&#xD;
             participant is otherwise suitable for enrollment. Partaicipants may continue adjuvant&#xD;
             hormonal therapy in the setting of a definitively treated cancer (e.g. breast cancer).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Known intolerance to or life threatening side effects resulting from prior checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitor therapy.&#xD;

             definitive radiotherapy or surgery), seizures requiring anticonvulsant treatment (&lt;3&#xD;
             months) or clinically significant cerebrovascular accident (&lt;3 months). In order to be&#xD;
             eligible participant must have repeat CNS imaging at least a month after definitive&#xD;
             treatment showing stable CNS disease. Participants with evidence of intratumoral or&#xD;

             grade &lt;= 1 and has been shown to be stable on two consecutive imaging scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because these drugs have not been tested&#xD;
             in pregnant women and there is potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with these immunotherapies, breastfeeding should&#xD;
             be discontinued if the mother is treated on this protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active autoimmune disease that might deteriorate when receiving an immunostimulatory&#xD;

                  steroids are administered only for the purpose of hormonal replacement and at&#xD;
                  doses &lt;= 10 mg of prednisone or equivalent per day;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Administration of steroids for other conditions through a route known to result&#xD;
                  in a minimal systemic exposure (topical, intranasal, intro-ocular, or inhalation)&#xD;
                  is acceptable;&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Subjects on systemic intravenous or oral corticosteroid therapy with the&#xD;
                  exception of physiologic doses of corticosteroids (&lt;= the equivalent of&#xD;

                  cyclosporin A are excluded on the basis of potential immune suppression. For&#xD;
                  these subjects these excluded treatments must be discontinued at least 1 weeks&#xD;
                  prior to enrollment for recent short course use (&lt;= 14 days) or discontinued at&#xD;
                  least 4 weeks prior to enrollment for long term use (&gt; 14 days). In addition, the&#xD;
                  use of corticosteroids as premedication for contrast- enhanced studies is allowed&#xD;
                  prior to enrollment and on study.&#xD;

             Investigator as high risk for investigational drug treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects unwilling to accept blood products as medically indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of non-HPV associated second malignancy within 3 years of enrollment except&#xD;
             localized malignancy which has been adequately treated or malignancy which does not&#xD;
             require active systemic treatment (e.g,, low risk CCL). Patients taking adjuvant&#xD;
             hormonal therapy for definitively treated cancers (e.g. breast cancer) are eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects with a known severe hypersensitivity reaction to a monoclonal antibodies&#xD;
             (grade &gt;/= 3 NCI-CTCAE v5) will be evaluated by the allergy/immunology team prior to&#xD;
