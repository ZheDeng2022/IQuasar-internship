      This study aims to examine the effectiveness of Experience Sampling Method (ESM) derived&#xD;
      personalised feedback for women at risk of common mental disorder in Hong Kong, in reducing&#xD;
      individuals depressive and anxiety symptoms.&#xD;

      Women who are at-risk for common mental disorders and have completed the online screening for&#xD;
      Jockey Club Mental Wellness Project for Women (JCWow) will be recruited. This study aims to&#xD;
      test the effectiveness of ESM-derived personalized feedback in reducing symptoms of&#xD;
      depression and anxiety using a randomised controlled trial. After given written consent, the&#xD;
      participants will be required to undergo a 5 days baseline ESM data collection (week 0). Upon&#xD;
      completion of baseline data collection, they will be randomly assigned to the intervention&#xD;
      (ESM-F), active reference (ESM) or control (CON) group. The participants in the intervention&#xD;
      group will participate in an ESM procedure (three days per week over a 6-week period) using&#xD;
      through SMS system (week 1 - 6). This group will receive weekly standardised feedback on&#xD;
      personalised patterns of positive affect. The active reference group will also participate in&#xD;
      the same ESM procedure without a weekly feedback. The control group will not be required to&#xD;
      undergo this 6-week data collection procedure. At week 7, all three groups will undergo&#xD;
      another 5 days of post-intervention ESM data collection in order to examine the naturalistic&#xD;
      and interventional changes on the depressive symptoms. From week 8 onwards, the participants&#xD;
      will be contacted 5 times (week 8, 12, 16, 20 and 32) via telephone to follow-up their&#xD;
      condition. After 32 weeks, both active reference and control group will receive the report.&#xD;

It ranges from 0 to 42. Higher score indicates more severe level of depressive symptoms.</description>

    <description>Participants will be required to participate in an ESM data collection procedure. Participants will be required to complete a beep-questionnaire 3 days a week, over a 6-week period. The mobile app will be programmed to emit a beep 10 times per day at random intervals between 7.30 and 22.30. At each beep, participants will use the app to digitally complete a brief beep-questionnaire, which covers current affect, current context and activities. Moreover, participants will receive weekly standardized feedback on personalized patterns of positive affect.</description>

    <description>The ESM-F group will receive standardised ESM-derived feedback immediately followed the weekly ESM data collection procedure, totalling 6 times in the entire intervention period. The feedback will be provided by the researcher in the format of written report and verbal explanation. The feedback on participants' momentary affective state in specific daily life contexts and the association with depressive symptoms will be given. The changes in positive affect level and the number of depressive complaints over the course of the ESM intervention will be shown.</description>
