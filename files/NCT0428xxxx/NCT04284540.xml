  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this research study is to investigate a shorter radiation treatment schedule&#xD;
      for head and neck cancers in patients 70 years of age and older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Standard radiation treatment for head and neck patients normally requires that the patient&#xD;
      travel to the hospital daily for 6-7 weeks to receive radiation treatment 5 days per week.&#xD;
      This long course of radiation can lead to significant side effects resulting in some people&#xD;
      being unable to complete the course of treatment. If this happens, and there are gaps in the&#xD;
      radiation treatment, this can lead to worse outcomes.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized pilot study examining the objective response rate and tolerability&#xD;
      of short-course radiotherapy (RT) in elderly patients who are unfit for standard conventional&#xD;
      fractionation treatment with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). There will be two&#xD;
      unrelated cohorts in this study: definitive RT and adjuvant RT. Patients will be assigned to&#xD;
      the cohorts based on their surgical or non-surgical candidacy. The primary study measure is&#xD;
      the locoregional control (LRC) rate of patients at 6 months post RT treated with short-course&#xD;
      RT. Locoregional control at one year will be determined by radiographic (PET/CT) and clinical&#xD;
      assessment of disease. For the definitive cohort, LRC will be defined as regression in size&#xD;
      or disappearance of primary tumor and/or lymph nodes on imaging or clinical examination; and&#xD;
      for the adjuvant cohort, LRC will be defined as absence of disease on imaging or no clinical&#xD;
      evidence of disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To further investigate the treatment regimen, the study team will assess the safety of&#xD;
      short-course RT and determine the incidence of serious complications, overall survival (OS),&#xD;
      disease-free survival (DFS) within 1 year, and the change in quality of life (QoL) in these&#xD;
      patients who are unfit for standard conventional fractionation treatment with head and neck&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as secondary objectives. Secondary endpoints will include 1-&#xD;
      year overall survival (OS), 1-year disease-free survival (DFS), and the total score of the&#xD;
      Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy-Head and Neck questionnaire (FACT-H&amp;N). DFS will be&#xD;
      defined from the completion of treatment until disease recurrence locally, regionally and/or&#xD;
      distantly or until death from disease. OS will be defined from the RT to death or to last&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As a safety endpoint, the study team will calculate number and proportion of patients&#xD;
      developing reportable AEs and SAEs according to relatedness to the treatment and stratified&#xD;
      by severity.&#xD;
