  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Several published clinical trials have shown the superiority of immunotherapy in neoadjuvant&#xD;
      setting. Here we conducted this real world study to see whether neoadjuvant immunotherapy&#xD;
      would bring MPR and survival benefits in NSCLC, for example, single agent immunotherapy or&#xD;
      immunotherapy combination with chemotherapy. Furthermore biomarker analysis would be also&#xD;
      performed to achieve personalized neoadjuvant immunotherapy.&#xD;
