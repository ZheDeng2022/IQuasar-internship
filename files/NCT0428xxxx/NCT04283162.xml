  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Calcium dobesilate has been recommended to treat diabetic retinopathy due to its potential in&#xD;
      protecting against retinal vascular damage. However, there was limited evidence exploring its&#xD;
      efficacy in combating diabetic retinopathy progression. This study, a single-blind,&#xD;
      multicenter, cluster-randomized, controlled superiority trial, was designed to evaluate&#xD;
      whether calcium dobesilate could prevent diabetic retinopathy progression into an advanced&#xD;
      stage among Chinese patients with mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      A total of 1,200 patients with mild to moderate non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy will&#xD;
      be enrolled and randomly assigned at a ratio of 1:1 into the control group (that is,&#xD;
      conventional treatment group) and the intervention group (that is, conventional treatment&#xD;
      plus calcium dobesilate [500 mg, 3 times per day] for 12 months). The severity of diabetic&#xD;
      retinopathy will be assessed by the Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study scale.&#xD;
