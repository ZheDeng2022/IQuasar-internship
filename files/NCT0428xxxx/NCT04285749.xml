      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a medication, fluvastatin, can change&#xD;
      melanoma to a state that is less likely to metastasize or recur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Fluvastatin is experimental in this setting because it is not approved by the Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for treatment or prevention of melanoma. However, fluvastatin has been&#xD;
      approved by the FDA for treating high cholesterol.&#xD;

      This is an open-label, single arm, study assessing the activity of fluvastatin in shifting&#xD;
      the transcriptome in melanoma. Subjects with melanoma will be asked to participate and all&#xD;
      subjects will receive the study drug, fluvastatin, for 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study to determine whether administration of fluvastatin&#xD;
      changes the melanoma transcriptome&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective of this study is to determine whether administration of fluvastatin&#xD;
      changes the gene expression profile of Class 2 melanoma to Class 1 melanoma.&#xD;

A 2-fold change in the appropriate direction with a p-value of at least 0.05 will be considered significant for potential therapeutic value. P-values will be corrected for the false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure.

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Histologically or cytologically confirmed melanoma clinically staged as AJCC Stage&#xD;
             1-3.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent document.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant having received a statin drug within 1 month of study enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant receiving any other investigational agents.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of adverse reactions (eg. myalgias, transaminitis, or rhabdomyolysis)&#xD;
             attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to fluvastatin or&#xD;
             other agents used in this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to&#xD;
             ongoing or active infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina&#xD;
             pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, liver disease, or psychiatric illness/social situations&#xD;
             that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participant currently pregnant (as assessed by positive pregnancy test prior to&#xD;
             enrollment) or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
             --Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because Fluvastatin has&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Women of childbearing&#xD;
             potential will be asked to take a pregnancy test prior to enrollment (unless a&#xD;
             pregnancy test administered within the last month is present in the medical record and&#xD;
             is negative). A woman of childbearing potential is defined as a premenopausal female&#xD;
             capable of becoming pregnant. Men do not need to use contraception while taking this&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants currently receiving BRAF inhibitors, MEK inhibitors, immunotherapy, or&#xD;
             any other non-surgical treatment for melanoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants currently receiving nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. These&#xD;
             participants are excluded because use of NRTIs may confound the transcriptome&#xD;
             measurements used in this study since as described above they are predicted to modify&#xD;
             melanoma gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any condition or situation that, in the investigator's opinion, may put the patient at&#xD;
             significant risk, or may significantly interfere with the patient's participation in&#xD;
             the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants concurrently taking macrolide antibiotics (eg erythromycin,&#xD;
             clarithromycin), azole antifungals (eg itraconazole, ketoconazole), protease&#xD;
             inhibitors (eg ritonavir, telaprevir), gemfibrozil, cyclosporine, danazol, amiodarone,&#xD;
             amlodipine, verapamil, diltiazem, azithromycin, carbamazepine, phenytoin, or rifampin&#xD;
             are excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Participants with baseline ALT greater than 3 times the upper limit of normal.&#xD;
