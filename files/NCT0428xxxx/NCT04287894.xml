  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with pathologically proven stage III NSCLC will be treated with CIT-induction. In&#xD;
      the feasibility phase, the first cohort (cohort 1A) will receive only 1 course of the&#xD;
      immunotherapy doublet followed by a single dose of Durvalumab (Figure 1). The 2nd cohort&#xD;
      (Figure 1, cohort 2A) will open for inclusion if 5 to 6 out of 6 patients complete CIT-CRT&#xD;
      according to the safety rules (paragraph 6.1.3). In next cohort two courses of Tremelimumab&#xD;
      and Durvalumab will be administered. The expansion cohort will be opened (Figure 1, cohort&#xD;
      2B) if this is well tolerated. Patients will be enrolled for cohort 1B in case &lt; 5 out of 6&#xD;
      patients complete CIT-CRT in cohort 2A.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Provision of signed, written and dated informed consent prior to any study specific&#xD;
             procedures.&#xD;

             Pathologically proven NSCLC stage III or inoperable stage II (cT1-3N0-1), according to&#xD;
             the 8th edition of the AJCC staging, with a clinical indication for concurrent&#xD;
             chemo-irradiation. Patients with locoregional recurrent lung tumour following surgery&#xD;
             or a second primary cancer are eligible, unless a pneumonectomy was performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
             5. Patients should be able to receive concurrent chemo radiotherapy treatment as&#xD;
             approved by the MDM.&#xD;
&#xD;

             with childbearing potential; 8. For women of childbearing potential: agreement to&#xD;
             remain abstinent (refrain from heterosexual intercourse) or use contraceptive methods&#xD;
             that result in a failure rate of ≤ 1% per year, during the treatment period and for at&#xD;
             least 180 days after the last dose of Durvalumab and Tremelimumab combination therapy&#xD;
             or 1 month after the last dose of chemotherapy, whichever is later.&#xD;
&#xD;
        A woman is considered to be of childbearing potential if she is postmenarcheal, has not&#xD;
        reached a postmenopausal state (≥12 continuous months of amenorrhea with no identified&#xD;
        cause other than menopause), and has not undergone surgical sterilization (removal of&#xD;
        ovaries and/or uterus).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Examples of contraceptive methods with a failure rate of ≤ 1% per year include bilateral&#xD;
        tubal ligation, male sterilization, established proper use of hormonal contraceptives that&#xD;
        inhibit ovulation, hormone-releasing intrauterine devices (IUDs), and copper IUDs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The following age-specific requirements apply:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women &lt;50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of exogenous hormonal treatments&#xD;
             and if they have luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone levels in the&#xD;
             post-menopausal range for the institution or underwent surgical sterilization&#xD;
             (bilateral oophorectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Women ≥50 years of age would be considered post-menopausal if they have been&#xD;
             amenorrheic for 12 months or more following cessation of all exogenous hormonal&#xD;
             treatments, had radiation-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, had&#xD;
             chemotherapy-induced menopause with last menses &gt;1 year ago, or underwent surgical&#xD;
             sterilization (bilateral oophorectomy, bilateral salpingectomy or hysterectomy).&#xD;
&#xD;
             9. Adequate organ function. Minimum required laboratory data. 10. No major&#xD;
             contra-indications for undergoing EBUS and/or mediastinoscopy. 11. For patients&#xD;
             included in the two feasibility cohorts a calculation for the mean lung dose (MLD) for&#xD;
             radiotherapy will be performed: in both cohorts at least 2 out of 6 patients with a&#xD;
             MLD ≥ 16 need to be included.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  1. Patients with grade 3 dyspnoea or worse at baseline (according to CTCAE version&#xD;
             4.03).&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Prior radiotherapy to the thorax. 3. Participation in another clinical study with&#xD;
             an investigational product during the last 4 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Concurrent enrolment in another clinical study, unless it is an observational&#xD;
             (non-interventional) clinical study or the follow-up period of an interventional study&#xD;
             5. Recent major surgery within 4 weeks prior to entry into the study (excluding the&#xD;
             placement of vascular access) that would prevent administration of chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

             infection, symptomatic congestive heart failure, uncontrolled hypertension, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, interstitial lung disease, serious chronic&#xD;
             gastrointestinal conditions associated with diarrhea, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements, substantially increase&#xD;
             risk of incurring AEs or compromise the ability of the patient to give written&#xD;
             informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
             7. Presence of any psychological, familial, sociological or geographical condition&#xD;
             potentially hampering compliance with the study protocol and follow-up schedule; those&#xD;
             conditions should be discussed with the patient before registration in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
             8. Any condition that, in the opinion of the investigator, would interfere with&#xD;
             evaluation of the CRT or interpretation of patient safety or study results.&#xD;
&#xD;
