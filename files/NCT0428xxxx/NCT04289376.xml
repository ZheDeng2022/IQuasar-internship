    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to measure the gaze movements of individuals as they watch&#xD;
      videos of a baseball pitcher throwing pitches. The goal will be to determine whether there is&#xD;
      an anticipatory movement to the location where the ball is released, and whether this&#xD;
      anticipatory movement occurs in experienced baseball players more commonly than in&#xD;
      inexperienced players.&#xD;

      20 subjects between 18 and 40 years of age (males and females) will participate. 10 subjects&#xD;
      will be required to have experience in baseball or softball at the high school level or above&#xD;
      within the last 10 years. A further 10 subjects will be recruited who did not have baseball&#xD;
      experience at or above the high school level. Upon entering the laboratory, the experiment&#xD;
      will be explained to the subjects. Subjects will be consented. Then, the subject's visual&#xD;
      acuity and stereoacuity (depth perception) will be measured.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If subjects continue on to the experiment, they will also be asked to complete a short survey&#xD;
      on previous baseball experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will sit approximately 35 feet and facing a projector screen. They will then&#xD;
      participate in trials in which they mimic catching a ball thrown by a pitcher. Six different&#xD;
      pitch videos will be shown. The subjects will then attempt to catch the ball for each video.&#xD;
      The movement of the subject's eye will be tracked using an eye tracker.&#xD;
