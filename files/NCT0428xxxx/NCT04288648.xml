    <textblock>
      Examination of pelvic floor contraction in different positions among women with and without&#xD;
      stress urinary incontinence (SUI) will be conducted via diagnostic ultrasound. This will&#xD;
      enable clinicians and researchers to establish an appropriate protocol for pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle examination and treatment.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The main goal of this study is to compare the ability of the pelvic floor muscles to contract&#xD;
      in different positions among women suffering from SUI to healthy women. Secondary objectives:&#xD;
      is to compare subjective reports of the difficulty to contract the pelvic floor muscles&#xD;
      between the two groups, and to examine the connection between the severity of urinary leakage&#xD;
      and the ability to contract pelvic floor muscles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include 50 female participants in the ages of 18-45. Research group will&#xD;
      include 25 participants suffering from SUI in accordance with the International Consultation&#xD;
      on Incontinence Questionnaire Short Form (ICIQ-SF) and 25 healthy participants (grade 0 on&#xD;
      the ICIQ-SF questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The examination will be performed with an abdominal ultrasound device in supine, sitting,&#xD;
      standing and squatting. The Height of the bladder base will be measured during rest period&#xD;
      and maximal contraction. The extent and direction of bladder base movement would indicate the&#xD;
      quality of pelvic floor performance. Next, the length of contraction time will be measured.&#xD;
      The participant would hold the maximal contraction as long as possible in order to examine&#xD;
      muscular endurance. Rest will be given between tests. After finishing the tests in all four&#xD;
      postures, the participants will be questioned about the degree of difficulty contracting the&#xD;
      pelvic floor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Significance of the study: The importance of the research is about granting the clinicians&#xD;
      and researchers additional tools in order to help establishing a protocol for pelvic floor&#xD;
      muscle activity examination and treatment.&#xD;
