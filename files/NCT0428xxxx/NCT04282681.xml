  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this study is to collect accelerometer data from subjects monitored&#xD;
      in an EMU with concurrent video EEG.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      XLTCS (LNE-800) is an international multicenter prospective data collection study to gather&#xD;
      accelerometer data. The population under the study comprises patients monitored in an&#xD;
      Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (EMU) with concurrent video EEG and who are expected to have at&#xD;
      least one seizure with tonic-clonic convulsive movement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A maximum of one hundred and fifty (150) patients will be enrolled and will wear an&#xD;
      accelerometer, and up to 6 sites may participate in this study. The total enrollment period&#xD;
      will take approximately 2 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the accelerometer was adhered to the subject, subjects will be followed for a minimum of&#xD;
      2 days and a maximum of 10 days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subject participation will run concurrently with the EMU admission. Exit from the study&#xD;
      occurs when the subject's stay in the EMU is completed or the subject is withdrawn or&#xD;
      withdraws from the study.&#xD;

    <description>The study will evaluate accelerometer data and tonic-clonic seizure data that was collected during the patients' EMU admission. The sample size is not based on a statistical power calculation, thus no primary endpoint is defined in the clinical investigation plan.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Four (4) years of age or older.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Admitted to an Epilepsy Monitoring Unit for video EEG monitoring.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Based on medical history, expected to have at least one seizure with tonic-clonic&#xD;
             convulsive movement during the EMU stay as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Capable of understanding and willing to comply with instructions and study procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Subject or guardian must be willing and able to complete informed consent/assent.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Based on medical history, expected to have only non-epileptic events during the EMU&#xD;
             stay as determined by the investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Based on medical history, known to have only absence seizures.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Medical or psychiatric condition that in the investigator's judgment would prevent the&#xD;
             subject's successful completion of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Participants with known hypersensitivity or skin sensitivity conditions that will&#xD;
             preclude attachment of the accelerometer.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Participants who are also taking part in another clinical trial that could confound&#xD;
             the results of the studyÍ¾ these patients can be included into the study only if&#xD;
             LivaNova has provided written approval.&#xD;
