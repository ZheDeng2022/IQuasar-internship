  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to assess the test-retest reliability of an infant RRV paradigm&#xD;
      which will allow researchers to study food reinforcement among infant of 9-18 months of age.&#xD;
      By understanding the origins of food reinforcement, future interventions can be conducted to&#xD;
      help overweight and obese population to alter their reinforcing values of food at a young&#xD;
      age, perhaps during infancy.&#xD;

      1. Initial email or phone screen:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Upon receiving an inquiry from a prospective participant, the study will be explained.&#xD;
           If the prospective participant has an infant age 9 to 18 months, and the caregiver is&#xD;
           interested in joining the study, a verbal consent will be obtained in order to screen&#xD;
           for eligibility criteria. The initial screening questionnaire could be done via phone or&#xD;
           online via Survey Monkey (see Initial Phone Screen/Survey Monkey Questionnaire for&#xD;
           details). The information assessed during the initial screen is recorded in a secure&#xD;
           database that requires a password. The database is used by select members of the&#xD;
           Division of Behavioral Medicine and has been approved for use by previous IRB&#xD;
           committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Families will also be sent a list of links of questionnaires to be completed at home&#xD;
           before the assessments. These questionnaires include the Demographic Questionnaire,&#xD;
           Pregnancy History and Infant Feeding Practice Questionnaire, Food Security&#xD;
           Questionnaire, Infant Behavior Questionnaires-Revised (IBQ-R), and Baby Eating Behavior&#xD;
           Questionnaire (BEBQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Session 1:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If families meet the initial criteria gathered from the initial screen, families will be&#xD;
           scheduled for a laboratory visit (40 min). For this visit, the caregiver will be advised&#xD;
           to choose a time of the day when the infant is generally alert, active, and ready to&#xD;
           play. The infant needs to be fed one hour prior to the lab visit. The caregiver will be&#xD;
           reminded to bring diapers or change of clothes for the infant. The caregiver will also&#xD;
           be reminded not to feed her infant the test food (infant's favorite food) 24 hours&#xD;
           before the laboratory visit. At the first visit, there will be an overview of the study.&#xD;
           If interested, the caregiver will be asked to review and sign consent forms. Two copies&#xD;
           of the consent forms will be signed by all parties involved, person obtaining consent,&#xD;
           and the participating parent. One copy will be obtained by the study personnel and one&#xD;
           copy will be given to the participants for their records. The copy obtained by study&#xD;
           personnel will be kept in a locked cabinet.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After signing the consent form, the caregiver and infant will be escorted to a&#xD;
           laboratory room where the food reinforcement game will take place. At this visit, infant&#xD;
           will play the first part of the RRV game. Infants will be securely fastened on a high&#xD;
           chair. The caregiver will be in the room with the infant at all-time during the game.&#xD;
           The caregiver will be reminded that the entire reinforcement task procedure will be&#xD;
           video recorded to obtain vocalization, body movement, and facial expression of the&#xD;
           infant. The baseline state of the infant will be assessed. There are five states: 1 =&#xD;
           drowsy, 2 = alert/calm, 3 = alert/active, 4 = fussy, 5 = crying. Before the start of the&#xD;
           game, a study staff member will go through a training session with the infant to&#xD;
           familiarize him/her with the computer based game and button/monitor interface. The&#xD;
           caregiver will be asked to assist with the training by repeating phrases the researchers&#xD;
           use during the game. After the training, the study staff member will start the actual&#xD;
           game.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After the session is finished, a 3-day dietary recall will be conducted via phone by a&#xD;
           dietetic student intern&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Additional Laboratory Sessions:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants are invited to attend 3 additional 40 minute laboratory sessions. For these&#xD;
      visits, the infants will be playing the second part of the RRV game (please refer Session 1&#xD;
      for details on the game), and then repeat RRV Games parts 1 and 2 on the subsequent&#xD;
      laboratory visits. After Sessions 1, 2, and 3, the dietetic student intern will call the&#xD;
      caregiver and conduct a 24-hour dietary recall. Before leaving the last visit, the height and&#xD;
      weight of the caregiver and infant will be measured.&#xD;
