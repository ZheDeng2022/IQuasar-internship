    <textblock>
      This open-label to double-blind study evaluates the impact of cannabidiol (CBD) on anxiety in&#xD;
      adults. Participants will use a custom-formulated sublingual (under-the-tongue) solution of&#xD;
      whole plant, hemp-derived CBD twice daily for six weeks in addition to their normal treatment&#xD;
      regimen. Participants' clinical state will be assessed weekly during the treatment period.&#xD;
      Quality of life, sleep, general health, and cognitive function will also be assessed.&#xD;

      This investigation will be the first of its kind to conduct a clinical trial of an industrial&#xD;
      hemp-derived product in individuals with anxiety. Despite the recent interest in medical&#xD;
      cannabis and cannabinoid-based products, the availability of hemp-derived products in all 50&#xD;
      states, and anecdotal evidence suggesting that hemp-derived products may have a profound&#xD;
      anxiolytic effect, no studies have conducted a clinical trial of a hemp-derived product in&#xD;
      individuals who suffer from anxiety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation is composed of two phases. Phase 1 is comprised of a six-week open-label&#xD;
      clinical trial of the custom formulated hemp-derived high-CBD solution in individuals with&#xD;
      anxiety. Participants will be pre-screened by phone in order to evaluate their eligibility&#xD;
      for the study. If approved, participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening&#xD;
      visit, and will complete a structured clinical interview, clinical and quality of life&#xD;
      questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Enrolled participants will be given study product&#xD;
      to use for the duration of the study; participants will be instructed to self-administer the&#xD;
      solution under the tongue twice daily for six weeks. Throughout the treatment period,&#xD;
      participants will complete short in-person or phone visits on a weekly basis, where they will&#xD;
      complete questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants will also return&#xD;
      to the hospital for a final visit after six weeks of treatment to complete additional&#xD;
      questionnaires and cognitive assessments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2 of the study is a double-blind clinical trial of this solution in patients with&#xD;
      anxiety. This double-blind trial will begin after the open-label trial has been completed. In&#xD;
      the same manner as the open-label trial, participants will be pre-screened by phone, and&#xD;
      approved participants will come to the hospital for a baseline/screening visit to complete a&#xD;
      structured clinical interview, questionnaires, and cognitive assessments. Eligible&#xD;
      participants will also have the option to complete an hour-long MRI scan at the baseline and&#xD;
      final visits. Enrolled participants will receive either CBD solution or placebo solution to&#xD;
      self-administer throughout the six week treatment period, as described above. Participants&#xD;
      will complete in-person visits and phone check-ins during the treatment period to complete&#xD;
      questionnaires about their mood and quality of life. Participants in this phase of the study&#xD;
      will also return for a final visit after six weeks of treatment to complete additional&#xD;
      questionnaires, cognitive assessments, and an optional MRI scan.&#xD;
