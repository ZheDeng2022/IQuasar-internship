  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to test the feasibility of one type of therapy session, Virtual&#xD;
      Augmented Engage (Engage-A). The research is being done because the researchers are trying to&#xD;
      learn if these approaches could be used by therapists in the community social service&#xD;
      agencies to treat older adults with depression. The research will also measure clinician&#xD;
      satisfaction after training and supervision of utilization of Engage-A.&#xD;
