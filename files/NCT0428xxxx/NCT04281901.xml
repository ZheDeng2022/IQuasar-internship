      This clinical study evaluates the efficacy of the autologous blood-derived product called&#xD;
      platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP) for the treatment of chronically&#xD;
      inflamed post-surgical temporal bone cavities. Half of the participants will be treated with&#xD;
      platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma and another half with standard nonsurgical&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The hypothesis of this study is that platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP)&#xD;
      may be efficient in the treatment of chronically inflamed post-surgical temporal bone&#xD;
      cavities.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a well-known autologous blood-derived product with favourable&#xD;
      immune, haemostatic and regenerative effects. It has been used in various medical fields&#xD;
      including otorhinolaryngology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In fact, PRP contains important concentrations of extracellular vesicles (EV) which are the&#xD;
      main contributors to PRP effects. For that reason, PRP can be identified as platelet- and&#xD;
      extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP). In this study, PVRP will be prepared by a unique&#xD;
      non-commercial 2-step centrifugation protocol developed by this study researchers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A radical cavity is a large post-surgical temporal bone cavity due to removal of the&#xD;
      posterior external ear canal wall in open-technique cholesteatoma surgery. This technique is&#xD;
      performed in approximately 40 per cent of cholesteatoma surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Radical cavities become inflamed in 3-20 per cent, which leads to the formation of&#xD;
      granulation tissue and multiple suppurative periods. The large spectrum of surgical and&#xD;
      nonsurgical treatment options have been applied to reduce patient discomfort. This&#xD;
      significantly worsens the patients' quality of life and puts a significant burden on health&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Due to the knowledge of local immune response mechanisms in moist radical cavities and&#xD;
      exhausted treatment options, new conservative treatment options have been researched. PVRP&#xD;
      could present a promising treatment option for chronically inflamed radical cavities based on&#xD;
      published preclinical and clinical studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PVRP will be administered to chronically inflamed radical cavities via PVRP-soaked ear wicks.&#xD;

    <time_frame>Baseline, 1 month, 2 months and 3 months after baseline</time_frame>
    <description>The inflamed tissue in the postoperative temporal bone cavity was observed and photographed otomicroscopically. Then the surface area of the inflamed tissue was determined by using ZEN 3.0 blue edition software(©Carl Zeiss Microscopy GmbH, 2019).&#xD;
Values in square millimetres were transformed to the ratios of the inflamed surface area according to the baseline surface area. The baseline surface area values are therefore 100% for each case or participant.</description>

    <description>Sum score of Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire 12 (COMQ-12), patient-reported health-related quality of life measure.&#xD;
Each question is scored from 0 to 5 points, therefore the minimum score value is 0 and the maximum 60.&#xD;
A higher score means worse chronic otitis media-related quality of life. A higher change in COMQ-12 score means a better treatment outcome.</description>

    <description>The microbiological analysis included incubation of smear samples to cultivate bacteria, present in postsurgical temporal bone cavity inflammation.

      <recruitment_details>25 participants with chronic postoperative temporal bone cavity inflammation were recruited at the tertiary otorhinolaryngology referral centre between February- March 2020. In this period the list of patients was created based on examinations and documentation review. 2 participants had bilateral involvement, therefore 27 cases were recruited.</recruitment_details>

          <description>Quality of life, related to chronic postoperative temporal bone cavity inflammation was measured with Slovenian version of COMQ-12 (Chronic Otitis Media Questionnaire-12). The questionnaire consists of 12 questions, scored 0-5. The higher sum score signifies the worse quality of life. The minimum sum score is 0 and the maximum is 60.</description>

Values in square millimetres were transformed to the ratios of the inflamed surface area according to the baseline surface area. The baseline surface area values are therefore 100% for each case or participant.</description>

      <time_frame>Adverse events were monitored from the beginning of the trial to the last check-up, i.e. from the baseline evaluation and 4 months after (4. check-up). Therefore, the adverse effects were monitored for 4 months.</time_frame>
      <desc>11 patients who received platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP) and 11 who received standard conservative treatment measures were at risk for serious adverse events, all-cause mortality and other adverse events. PVRP-related adverse events were defined as worsening of chronic postsurgical temporal bone inflammation due to PVRP. The worsening was attributed to PVRP if worsening of the clinical picture occurred within three days after PVRP administration.</desc>

          <description>Participants received platelet- and extracellular vesicle-rich plasma (PVRP)-soaked ear wick in the chronic postoperative temporal bone cavity inflammation at the baseline evaluation (i.e., 1. check-up) and 1 month later (i.e., 2. check-up). Two additional check-ups were performed in a 1-month interval. The aural toilet was applied at each check-up. No other treatment measures were applied&#xD;
