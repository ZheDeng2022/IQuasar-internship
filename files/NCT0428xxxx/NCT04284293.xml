  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The investigator is examining the safety of transplanting cells into the subretinal space of&#xD;
      patients with Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP). The cells are called neural progenitor cells, which&#xD;
      are a type of stem cell that can become several different types of cells in the nervous&#xD;
      system. These cells have been derived to specifically become astrocytes, which is a type of&#xD;
      neuronal cell. The cells are called &quot;CNS10-NPC.&quot; The investigational treatment has been&#xD;
      tested in animals, but it has not yet been tested in people. In this study, the investigators&#xD;
      want to learn if CNS10-NPC cells are safe to transplant into the subretinal space of people.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be the first to use a human progenitor cell line to treat retinitis&#xD;
      pigmentosa in people. This is a Phase 1/2a, single-center, open label, safety study of two&#xD;
      escalating doses of human neural progenitor cells (CNS10-NPC) delivered unilaterally to the&#xD;
      subretinal space of subjects with RP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects meeting all Eligibility Criteria and providing Informed Consent will be enrolled in&#xD;
      one of two sequential dosing groups. Subjects will be treated sequentially with a minimum of&#xD;
      one month interval between surgeries for the first three subjects in each dosing cohort. The&#xD;
      remaining subjects in the cohort will be treated with a minimum interval of at least one week&#xD;
      between surgeries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective. To assess the safety and tolerability of two escalating doses of clinical&#xD;
      grade human fetal cortical-derived neural progenitor cells (CNS10-NPC) administered in the&#xD;
      subretinal space of one eye (unilaterally) in patients with retinitis pigmentosa (RP).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives. Within constraints of a small first in-human study focused on safety:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine if CNS10-NPC can engraft and survive long-term in the retina of transiently&#xD;
           immunosuppressed subjects,&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Obtain evidence that subretinal injection of CNS10-NPC can favorably impact the&#xD;
           progression of vision loss in subjects with moderate RP.&#xD;

             contraception requirement (women who are unwilling to use an effective form of&#xD;
             contraception such as the contraceptive pill or intrauterine device).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Women who are pregnant.&#xD;

             safety assessments as specified by the protocol. Any mental or psychiatric disorders&#xD;
             that prevent the patient from having full authority to do so (i.e. the subject cannot&#xD;
