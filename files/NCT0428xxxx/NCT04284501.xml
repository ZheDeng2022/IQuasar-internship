      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headache is one of the leading chronic conditions bothering children (Newacheck PW 1992) and&#xD;
      the most common pain complaint when seeking medical advice (Genizi J 2013), with an evidence&#xD;
      for increased incidence of primary headaches in children and adolescents in the last 50 years&#xD;
      (Abu-Arefeh I 1994, Goodman JE 1991). As reported by studies, a clear and reliable estimate&#xD;
      of the magnitude of the problem has showed that around 60% of the children and adolescents&#xD;
      are prone to headache, with attacks of variable frequency (Abu-Arafeh I 2010). The headache&#xD;
      begins to emerge during the early years of life, but the disorder usually becomes more&#xD;
      evident and frequent from the impact of school life, with a peak around 7 years old (Sillanpa&#xD;
      AM 1996).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Migraine and Tension-type headaches (TTH) are the most frequent types of primary headaches in&#xD;
      children: The prevalence of migraine is about 10% for girls and about 5% for boys (7%&#xD;
      overall), the prevalence of TTH is 0.9% to 24% (Zwart JA 2004, Asuni C 2010).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The diagnosis of primary headaches is mainly supported by anamnestic data and neurological&#xD;
      examination (Hershey AD 2010). While Migraine attack has fairly clear diagnostic criteria,&#xD;
      with some references to the unique features in children and adolescents, TTH's diagnosis is&#xD;
      based almost completely on exclusion criteria, meaning absence of any feature which can fit&#xD;
      another type of headache, and no attribution to any special features in children (The&#xD;
      International Classification of Headache Disorders: 2nd edition.( ICHD-II)).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Headaches and sensory modulation We didn't find any previous studies on the sensory&#xD;
      modulation of patients with headaches, however, children who suffer from primary headaches&#xD;
      have an increased risk for emotional and even psychiatric comorbidity such as anxiety and&#xD;
      mood disorders (Francesco Margari 2013). In addition, they also have a greater risk of&#xD;
      developing psychological disorders in adulthood (Egger HL 1999). Moreover, adolescents who&#xD;
      suffer from chronic headaches were found to have more somatic complaints such as abdominal&#xD;
      pain and disordered sleep (Genizi J 2013), which can also explains why headaches correlates&#xD;
      with a significant reduction in quality of life (Andreas Straube 2013).Aromaa et al. (Aromaa,&#xD;
      et al 2000) investigated the pain experiences of headaches in children and their family&#xD;
      members and found that Headache children seemed to be more cautious in play and hobbies,&#xD;
      because they were afraid of getting hurt. When migraine children were compared with tension-&#xD;
      type headache children the following differences were found: headache pain was significantly&#xD;
      more intensive among migraine children. They also reported that the mothers of tension-type&#xD;
      headache children were more often extremely sensitive to pain compared to mothers of migraine&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aromaa et al. found that increased general pain sensitivity proved to characterize children&#xD;
      with headache and their parents (Aromaa et al 2000).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurophysiological studies have disclosed various abnormalities of spinal, brainstem and&#xD;
      cortical responsivity to external innocuous or noxious stimuli in primary headaches:&#xD;
      Abnormalities of the habituation/sensitization mechanisms were discovered in migraine. In&#xD;
      tension-type headache several researches found some evidence of deficient habituation, and by&#xD;
      contrast, other disclosed evidence for sensitization in chronic TTH. Future studies will have&#xD;
      to determine whether there is an interaction between abnormal sensory processing and other&#xD;
      metabolic abnormalities (Gianluca Coppola 2013).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interaction between sensory sensitivity and behavioral/ emotional responses:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory hypersensitivity may result from inability to effectively modulate sensory&#xD;
      information and to organize this sensory input in order to execute adaptive responses to&#xD;
      situational demands (Humphry, 2002). Individuals who are more sensitive to sensory&#xD;
      information than others (Aron et al., 1997) often perceive sensory events as noxious and&#xD;
      stressful (Bundy et al., 2002). They are more likely to experience depression, anxiety&#xD;
      disorders such as social phobia (Neal et al., 2002) and avoidant personality disorder&#xD;
      (Johnson et al., 2003, Meyer et al., 2000). They also show high levels of arousal (Pfeiffer&#xD;
      et al., 2005).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dunn's model for sensory processing may provide a possible explanation for the relationship&#xD;
      between sensory sensitivity and the behavioral output. Dunn's model outlines the relationship&#xD;
      between the person's neurological thresholds and the behavioral response/self regulation&#xD;
      continua (Brown et al., 2001, Dunn, 1997). Individuals found in the edges of the interaction&#xD;
      of these two continua, exhibit atypical sensory processing patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The neurological threshold refers to the point at which there is enough input to cause a&#xD;
      nerve cell or a system to activate (Kandel et al., 2000). The two poles of the neurological&#xD;
      threshold continuum are low and high. The low pole indicates that the individual requires low&#xD;
      intensity stimuli for neurons to fire and for the individuals to react. The high pole&#xD;
      represents individuals who require high intensity stimuli or take longer to react to the same&#xD;
      stimuli. The two poles of the self regulation continuum are anchored by passive versus active&#xD;
      coping strategies in relation to their thresholds. Individuals who utilize passive&#xD;
      strategies, would not counter act to unpleasant stimuli while those individuals who use&#xD;
      active strategies act to control the amount and type of sensory input (Dunn, 2007). According&#xD;
      to Dunn's model the interaction of these two continua results in four sensory processing&#xD;
      patterns. Individuals with high neurological thresholds experience either Low registration&#xD;
      (which reflects passive responses) or Sensation Seeking (which reflects an active response).&#xD;
      With low registration, people fail to detect or have slow responses to sensation. With&#xD;
      sensation seeking, people experience pleasure from rich sensory environment and behaviors&#xD;
      that create sensation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The other two patterns refer to those with low neurological thresholds: Sensation avoiding&#xD;
      which is an active strategy in response to a low neurological threshold, and Sensory&#xD;
      Sensitivity which reflects a passive pattern in response to low thresholds. People with&#xD;
      avoiding patterns engage in behaviors that limit exposure to stimuli, while people with&#xD;
      sensory sensitivity experience distractibility and discomfort with sensation (Dunn, 1997).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referring to the interaction between headaches in research and praxis is of most importance&#xD;
      since childhood anxiety disorders often predate depressive disorders and other forms of&#xD;
      psychopathology in adolescence and adulthood (Bittner et al., 2007) and are associated with a&#xD;
      range of negative consequences in terms of social, academic and personal adjustment (Messer&#xD;
      et al., 1994, Waters et al., 2013). Indeed, higher levels of somatic complaints in anxious&#xD;
      children are strongly associated with poorer school attendance, school refusal, and poorer&#xD;
      academic performance (Hughes et al., 2008). The distress and interference caused by headaches&#xD;
      may enhance threat-based cognitions and avoidance behaviour, thus contributing to a vicious&#xD;
      cycle of escalating symptom severity and negative functional outcomes (Waters et al., 2013),&#xD;
      that may significantly reduce child's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The relationship between headaches and quality of life:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Physical complaints as well as mental problems can adversely affect a patient's quality of&#xD;
      life (QOL) (Guthrie et al., 2002, Bernklevet al., 2004). Indeed, people with headaches have&#xD;
      impaired health-related QOL (Cavallini A1 1995). The relatively high percentage of children&#xD;
      with headaches and the associated negative emotional and functional outcomes, emphasize the&#xD;
      need to further explore additional involved factors that may contribute to the headaches&#xD;
      outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One of the factors that may be found among patients with headaches is sensory&#xD;
      hypersensitivity, which is part of a wider concept called sensory processing disorders that&#xD;
      include extreme hyper or hypo sensitivity to sensations. However, the knowledge about sensory&#xD;
      processing patterns of children and youth with headaches as well as its interaction with&#xD;
      child's emotional aspects and quality of life is scarce.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elaborating this knowledge may assist in focusing intervention on child and family specific&#xD;
      organic and emotional needs and thus optimize intervention outcomes and elevate quality of&#xD;
      life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hypotheses:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Children with headaches will show significantly higher sensory reactivity, higher&#xD;
           anxiety level and lower quality of life that health controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Among children with headaches, sensory reactivity will significantly correlate with&#xD;
           higher anxiety level and lower quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Among children with headaches quality of life will be predicted by sensory reactivity&#xD;
           and anxiety level.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study significance:&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is one of the first studies to explore the role of sensory reactivity and its relation&#xD;
      to the psychological (anxiety) aspects among children and youth with headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, by using an elaborated point of view this study also measures the interaction&#xD;
      between these factors and the child's quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Referring to this interaction is critical for the intervention process in the meaning of:&#xD;

      an emotional disorder, or some hybrid (b) increasing physicians' recognition of headaches&#xD;

      have the most significant impact on QOL of children with headaches.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will include 200 children aged 5- 18 years. The study group will include 100&#xD;
      children diagnosed with Primary headache - Migraine or TTH. They will be recruited from the&#xD;
      pediatric neurological clinic in Bnai-Zion Health Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control group will include 100 children from the community with typical development and&#xD;
      no history of chronic headaches or another chronic disease, no ADHD or learning disabilities,&#xD;
      matched by age, gender and socio-economic status to the study group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria for the study group:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with Primary headaches diagnosed as Migraine or TTH between 4-18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria for the sample group Evidence of an inflammatory, anatomic, metabolic, or&#xD;
      neoplastic process that explains the subject's symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessments:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires completed by the parents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health and demographic questionnaire - that will include socio-demographic information about&#xD;
      the child and his/her family as well as information about child's development and health&#xD;
      status. This questionnaire will be filled by the parents and will serve for assuring&#xD;
      inclusion criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Short Sensory Profile (SSP) (McIntosh DN, 1999): This is a shorter version of the Sensory&#xD;
      Profile (Dunn W, 1999), an instrument used for evaluating sensory processing abilities. The&#xD;
      shorter caregiver report measure is comprised of the 38 items that demonstrated the highest&#xD;
      discriminative power of atypical sensory processing among all the items from the longer&#xD;
      version of the Sensory Profile. The seven sections of the SSP found in a normative sample are&#xD;
      Tactile Sensitivity; Test/Smell Sensitivity; Movement Sensitivity; Under-responsive/Seeks&#xD;
      Sensation; Auditory Filtering; Low Energy/Weak; and Visual/Auditory Sensitivity. Internal&#xD;
      consistency of the sections within the scale ranged from .70 to .90 (Dunn W, 1999). Internal&#xD;
      validity correlations for the sections ranged from .25 to .76 and were all significant at&#xD;
      p&lt;.01. Initial studies of the validity of the SSP demonstrated discriminate validity of &gt;95%&#xD;
      in identifying children with and without sensory modulation difficulties (McIntosh DN, 1999).&#xD;
      Items are scored on a five-point scale. Both section scores and a total score are recorded on&#xD;
      the SSP. The possible range of raw scores on the total scale is 38 to 190, with higher scores&#xD;
      (155-190) reflecting normal performance. A score of 142-154 reflects a probable difference in&#xD;
      performance, while a score of 38-141 reflects a definite difference in performance (Dunn W,&#xD;
      1999). Time to complete the questionnaire: 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questionnaires completed by the children:&#xD;
&#xD;
      State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) for children - It is comprised of separate, self-report&#xD;
      scales for measuring two distinct anxiety concepts: state anxiety (S-Anxiety) and trait&#xD;
      anxiety (T-Anxiety). The STAIC is similar in conception and structure to the which provides&#xD;
      measures of anxiety for adolescents and adults (Spielberger CD et al., 1970). While&#xD;
      especially constructed to measure anxiety in nine- to twelve-year old children, the STAIC may&#xD;
      also be used with younger children with average or above reading ability and with older&#xD;
      children who are below average in ability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pediatric Quality of Life Inventory (Varni JW et al., 2006)- This is a short version of the&#xD;
      World Health Quality of Life questionnaire. It includes 23 statements which evaluate the&#xD;
      person's perception about his/her quality of life in regard to: physical health;&#xD;
      psychological health; social relationship and environment. Each statement is rated on a 0-4&#xD;
      scale which reflects the person's satisfaction from the content appearing in each statement&#xD;
      (0=never; 4 = always). Internal consistency of the questionnaire ranted between 0.7-0.9. The&#xD;
      questionnaire was found to differentiate between children with chronic health conditions and&#xD;
      healthy controls (t=-7.29; p=.001) (Varni JW et al., 2001).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ped MIDAS The Migraine Disability Assessment (MIDAS) questionnaire was developed to measure&#xD;
      the effect migraine headaches have on your daily function. It tries to determine how many&#xD;
      days of the child's life were affected to the point that he was unable to function in a way&#xD;
      to which he was accustomed. MIDAS takes into account the past three months when asking the&#xD;
      questions. It was later adapted for children and given the label &quot;PedMIDAS&quot; (as in,&#xD;
      pediatric). (Hershey AD, 2001) The PedMIDAS questionnaire also includes two other pieces of&#xD;
      information that are not used for calculating the child's disability score, but that give one&#xD;
      more way to illustrate to his or her health care provider how migraines affect your child's&#xD;
      life. It asks simply for an assessment of the headache frequency and severity for him or her.&#xD;
      The child's health care provider will take this information and couple it with the score to&#xD;
      try and gain a more accurate picture of how migraines are affecting your child (Hershey AD,&#xD;
      2004).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After receiving the ethical approvals for conducting this study by the Helsinki committee and&#xD;
      by the ethical board of the Faculty of Social Welfare and Health Sciences at the University&#xD;
      of Haifa, advertisements published in the clinics will call parents and children to&#xD;
      participate in a study about the relationship between child's headaches, sensory sensitivity,&#xD;
      anxiety and quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from the study group, who will answer the inclusion criteria will be invited to&#xD;
      the clinic. While the physician will diagnose the child, the parents will fill the&#xD;
      questionnaires. Following the physician examination, each child will be asked to complete the&#xD;
      STAI and the Peds-QL in a quite room with the research assistant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the control group we will use information from previous studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Analysis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive statistics will profile the socio-demographic and the scores of all dependent&#xD;
      variable, in each group. Significance of differences between groups will be examined by&#xD;
      MANOVA. Correlations between the dependent parameters will be examined by Pearson correlation&#xD;
      test. The ability of the dependent parameters to predict QOL will be examined by Linear&#xD;
      Regression Test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The level of significance will be set on p≤.005.&#xD;

    <description>The Short Sensory Profile (SSP)(26)- This parent report evaluated children's sensory processing patterns, as expressed in all sensory modality and in daily living situations (for example: &quot;will only eat certain tastes&quot;; &quot;reacts emotionally or aggressively to touch&quot;). The Parent scores their childs' response to sensory stimuli on a 5 point Likert scale, where 1 represents &quot;always&quot; and 5 &quot;never&quot;. Seven subtests are scored: tactile sensitivity, taste/smell sensitivity, sensitivity to movement, visual/auditory sensitivity and auditory filtering, as well as a total score which ranges between 38 to 190. Higher scores (155-190) reflect typical/normal performance. A score between 142-154 reflects a probable difference in performance while a score between 38-141 reflects a definite difference in performance</description>
