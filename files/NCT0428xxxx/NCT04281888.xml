    <textblock>
      Anemia is one of the most common complications in patients with sepsis in the intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU), as well as sepsis is a major cause of high mortality in ICU. Studies demonstrated&#xD;
      that sepsis-related anemia can be caused by fluid loading related hemodilution, iatrogenic&#xD;
      blood loss, decreases in iron supply, erythropoietin (EPO) production and erythrocyte&#xD;
      lifespan .&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, sepsis related anemia has been demonstrated to be associated mainly with&#xD;
      inflammation (i.e., &quot;anemia of inflammation&quot;). Anemia of inflammation is usually a mild to&#xD;
      moderately severe anemia (hemoglobin rarely &lt; 8 g/dL) . It develops in the setting of&#xD;
      infection, inflammatory disease or malignancy, together with low serum iron despite adequate&#xD;
      systemic iron stores, decreased serum transferrin, normal size of erythrocytes and hemoglobin&#xD;
      content or mildly decreased size and hemoglobin content of erythrocytes if the inflammatory&#xD;
      disease is longstanding .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Impaired iron homeostasis and the suppressive effects of proinflammatory cytokines on&#xD;
      erythropoiesis, together with alterations in the erythrocyte membrane that impair its&#xD;
      survival may result, ultimately, in inflammation-associated anemia .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hepcidin is a key regulator of inflammation-associated anemia. Hepcidin reduces the iron&#xD;
      level in plasma through:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. direct inhibition of intestinal absorption of iron.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. promotion of iron storage in macrophages by down regulating expression of ferroprotein&#xD;
           in intestinal mucosae and macrophages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) in patients with sepsis can induce an abruptly increased&#xD;
      synthesis of hepcidin, causing decreased plasma iron. Plasma iron can be depressed by&#xD;
      inflammation markedly (more than 50%) and rapidly ( with in 24 hrs). Also, the interaction&#xD;
      between inflammation and iron metabolism may interfere with other inflammatory anemia&#xD;
      associated parameters and complicate iron metabolism in patients with sepsis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Typically, plasma ferritin (which stores iron) is reduced in iron deficiency anemia but can&#xD;
      increase in the acute phase of sepsis. Anemia usually results in an increased synthesis of&#xD;
      EPO in kidneys in minutes to hours, but the response to EPO is blunted in patients with&#xD;
      sepsis . The soluble transferrin receptor (sTfR), an early and sensitive biomarker for&#xD;
      diagnosing iron deficiency , is particularly useful for identification of concomitant iron&#xD;
      deficiency in patients with inflammation. The sTfR is not affected by inflammation, which is&#xD;
      a significant advantage over other biomarkers. Plasma sTfR reflects the degree of iron&#xD;
      availability for cells, whereas plasma ferritin reflects iron storage. Hence, the ratio of&#xD;
      sTfR to log ferritin (hereafter termed &quot;sTfR/log ferritin&quot;) provides the efficacy of sTfR&#xD;
      alone or ferritin alone in the diagnosis of iron deficiency. These cytokines have the&#xD;
      propensity to promote iron restricted erythropoiesis, characterized by functional rather than&#xD;
      absolute iron deficiency, occurring secondary to dysregulation of iron metabolism.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Associations among inflammatory cytokines, EPO, and anemia in critically ill septic patients&#xD;
      remain unclear.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The inflammatory anemia-associated parameters mentioned above may change with the severity of&#xD;
      inflammation in patients with sepsis. The sensitivity and specificity of these parameters can&#xD;
      be modified if inflammation and iron deficiency are present concomitantly. This may&#xD;
      complicate the diagnosis, evaluation, and treatment of inflammatory anemia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, a better understanding of changes in the inflammatory anemia and associated parameters&#xD;
      in patients with sepsis at the early stage of ICU admission is needed urgently. In addition,&#xD;
      although severe anemia is associated with adverse outcomes in critical illness, a lowered&#xD;
      plasma iron is part of the natural defense against pathogens.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EPO has also been demonstrated to exert protective effects in the kidneys and lungs of mice&#xD;
      with sepsis, but EPO deficiency contributes to anemia development in patients with sepsis. As&#xD;
      a result of these effects, inflammatory anemia-associated parameters have been speculated to&#xD;
      be associated with the prognosis of patients with sepsis , but relevant studies are lacking&#xD;
