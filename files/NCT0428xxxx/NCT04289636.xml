    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to examine the feasibility of two approaches for improving&#xD;
      long-term weight loss success among individuals with severe obesity. All participants will&#xD;
      receive a 15-week, standard behavioral weight loss program followed by either 8 weeks of a&#xD;
      mindfulness self-compassion intervention or 8 weeks of a nutrition and cooking education&#xD;
      intervention (determined via randomization procedures). Assessments of weight, physical&#xD;
      activity, and other weight-related and psychosocial factors will occur at baseline, 4 months,&#xD;
      6 months, and 9 months.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive a 15-week behavioral weight loss program which teaches strategies for changing diet and exercise behaviors. This will consist of a combination of group and individual sessions. Group classes will be delivered remotely via a video-conferencing platform. This will be followed by an 8-week mindfulness-based self-compassion program which combines the skills of mindfulness and self-compassion as a means for improving emotional resilience, well-being, and weight control.</description>
