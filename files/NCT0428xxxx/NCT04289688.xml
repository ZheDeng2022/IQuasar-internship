  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Bloodstream infections are frequent in children admitted to the hospital for severe febrile&#xD;
      illness in sub-Saharan Africa.Ongoing blood culture surveillance at Kisantu Hospital showed&#xD;
      non-typhoidal Salmonella (NTS) as the first cause of bloodstream infections in children.&#xD;
      Bloodstream infections have a high case fatality (15 - 20%). Outcome of bloodstream&#xD;
      infections is dependent on timely diagnosis and treatment. However, observations at Kisantu&#xD;
      Hospital showed that many children arrive late and die early after admission.&#xD;
&#xD;
      By interviewing caregivers of severely ill children admitted to Kisantu Hospital, the&#xD;
      investigators aim to study their health itinerary, i.e. the sequence of all actions of health&#xD;
      care seeking and care provision between the onset of febrile illness and the admission at the&#xD;
      hospital. The investigators aim to assess the health itinerary according to the &quot;three&#xD;
      delays&quot; model. The three delays model studies delays and practices at the level of health&#xD;
      care seeking, of transport and of start of antibiotic treatment.10 Visits to referring health&#xD;
      centers will provide complementary information about diagnosis, treatment and referral&#xD;
      practices. In hospital follow-up will allow to assess the outcome according to the duration&#xD;
      of health itinerary. The results of routine laboratory tests upon hospital admission will&#xD;
      allow to stratify the health itinerary according to fever etiology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of this study will allow to understand the duration of the health itinerary, its&#xD;
      possible association with case-fatality, and factors explaining for delays at every level.&#xD;
      This information is expected to orient local health policy makers towards interventions&#xD;
      shortening the duration of the health itinerary and in that case improve and monitor the&#xD;
      referral system. In addition, the study results are expected to orient towards further&#xD;
      research to understand health seeking behavior (i.e. focus-group discussions and&#xD;
      community-based studies).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>

      The study is designed as a hospital-based cohort study at the pediatric ward of Kisantu&#xD;
      general referral hospital. The investigators foresee a study inclusion period of 5 months.&#xD;
      The study period is currently determined as such that it includes approximately 2 months of&#xD;
      the dry season and 3 months of the rainy season. Seasonality is taken into account, because&#xD;
      the rain affects the condition of the road and local disease epidemiology and can thus&#xD;
      influence the study results. Most data will be collected retrospectively, i.e. all data on&#xD;
      the health itinerary collected from the questionnaire and referral letter and the data from&#xD;
      the health records in the referring health centers. Only the data from the in-hospital&#xD;
      laboratory tests and clinical outcome will be collected prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data from the health records at referring health centers will be consulted after&#xD;
      termination of the five months study inclusion period to avoid any influence from the study&#xD;
      in the patient management at health centers during the study.&#xD;

        The study setting is the Kisantu health zone, which has a population of 202 451 people, of&#xD;
        which 48 043 are under 5 years old. The health zone is subdivided in 17 health areas that&#xD;
        are each served by at least one health center, by smaller health posts and by community&#xD;
        health workers.&#xD;
&#xD;
        The formal health care system is composed of 51 health care facilities. Next to the formal&#xD;
        health care system of community health workers, health posts and health centers, many&#xD;
        informal health care providers exist (Nurses and doctors provide care, private pharmacies&#xD;
        or drug vendors exist and traditional healers).&#xD;
&#xD;
        Local disease prevalence:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High P. falciparum malaria endemicity: 24% of children between 6-59 months had a&#xD;
             positive blood microscopy test in the last national demographic and health survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  High prevalence of malnutrition: 46% and 11% of children under five were respectively&#xD;
             chronically and acutely malnourished in the last national demographic and health&#xD;
             survey.&#xD;
