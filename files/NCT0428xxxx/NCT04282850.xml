  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective non-blinded randomized control pilot study comparing the effect of&#xD;
      pulmonary vein isolation against medical management of atrial fibrillation in patients with&#xD;
      Heart Failure with preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Recent studies using PVI for rhythm control in patients with heart failure with reduced&#xD;
      ejection fraction (HFrEF) have shown improvement in systolic ejection fraction, exercise&#xD;
      capacity, quality of life, and a significant reduction in all-cause mortality. The PVI&#xD;
      procedure has been shown to be safe and comparably effective in treating Atrial Fibrillation&#xD;
      (AF) in HFpEF patients, but no studies have yet demonstrated the effects of catheter ablation&#xD;
      on exercise capacity or clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators propose a prospective, non-blinded randomized control pilot study to assess&#xD;
      the feasibility of conducting larger scale studies to determine if there are differences&#xD;
      between catheter ablation with medical management on exercise capacity and quality of life in&#xD;
      HFpEF patients with AF. The investigators' study will be powered for AF burden reduction, and&#xD;
      the investigators hope to use the effect size on exercise capacity and heart failure events&#xD;
      to help determine power for larger clinical studies that will follow to shed light on how&#xD;
      invasive management of atrial fibrillation may impact the natural history of individuals with&#xD;
      these two cardiovascular conditions.&#xD;
