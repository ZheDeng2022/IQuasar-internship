      Purpose: To compare standard or technology integrated workshop delivery on coaches' measured&#xD;
      ability to and confidence in recognizing for errors for key components of exercises in a&#xD;
      soccer neuromuscular training (NMT) warm-up. Research in this area is needed to measure how&#xD;
      effective NMT warm-up workshops are on educating coaches and if technology integration into&#xD;
      the workshop improves their understanding as these measures are unknown to date.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Background: Injury prevention strategies such as using a NMT warm-up has been successful in&#xD;
      reducing injuries (Emery, Roy, Whittaker, Nettel-Aguirre, &amp; van Mechelen, 2015). NMT warm-up&#xD;
      workshops are provided to educate coaches however there are adoption issues for the coaches&#xD;
      (van Reijen, Vriend, van Mechelen, Finch, &amp; Verhagen, 2016). An effective workshop is&#xD;
      designed to enhance a coaches' self-efficacy and have a practical portion to work through the&#xD;
      exercises (Emery, 2015; Steffen et al., 2013). iPad applications such as the Move Improve&#xD;
      application are utilized to enhance peer to peer learning and provide feedback for the&#xD;
      subject performing the exercise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Research Plan: A randomized controlled trial (RCT) will be performed with clubs from the&#xD;
      Calgary Minor Soccer Association (CMSA). Coaches from the recruited clubs will be randomized&#xD;
      to attend one of two types of workshops : 1) intervention group (technology integrated coach&#xD;
      NMT warm-up workshop) and 2) control group (standard NMT warm-up workshop.The control&#xD;
      workshop is a two-hour workshops that includes an information period, on field instruction&#xD;
      and partnered practice for all soccer NMT exercises. The technology-based workshop which is a&#xD;
      two-hour workshop that includes on field exercise instruction and then partnered practice&#xD;
      with use of the Move Improve mobile application for all soccer NMT exercises. All coaches&#xD;
      (n=100; 50 per group) prior to the workshop commencing interested participants with be asked&#xD;
      to fill out the consent form, the soccer NMT demographic information form and the Soccer NMT&#xD;
      warm-up exercise self-efficacy questionnaire. Following the workshop, coaches will be asked&#xD;
      to complete Soccer NMT warm-up exercise self-efficacy questionnaire again and the soccer NMT&#xD;
      warm-up exercise test.&#xD;

      Study Design A cluster randomized controlled trial (RCT) was conducted within the Calgary&#xD;
      Minor Soccer Association (CMSA) in 2019 to evaluate how integration of peer to peer (P2P)&#xD;
      learning with technology into a soccer NMT warm-up workshop influences coaches' ability and&#xD;
      confidence to identify exercise errors. Soccer coaches within each recruited club were&#xD;
      randomly educated with a soccer NMT warm-up workshop with or without peer to peer learning&#xD;
      technology. Coaches completed a video-based test and self-efficacy scale on their ability to&#xD;
      recognize NMT exercise errors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants and Randomization The study population included CMSA youth soccer coaches during&#xD;
      the 2019/2020 indoor soccer season. The forty soccer clubs of the CMSA received a study&#xD;
      information flyer by e-mail from the CMSA administration staff. Six of the soccer clubs&#xD;
      agreed to host soccer NMT warm-up workshops at their club houses for a total of 89 youth&#xD;
      soccer coaches in attendance.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coaches from the recruited clubs were randomized to attend one of two types of workshops; the&#xD;
      intervention workshop with technology integrated instruction of the soccer NMT warm-up or the&#xD;
      control workshop with standard in person instruction of the soccer NMT warm-up. A stratified&#xD;
      by soccer club and block randomized by two (for each type of workshop) computer generated&#xD;
      randomized allocation sequence was used to determined which workshop the coaches receive&#xD;
      within each club. The randomized allocation sequence was generated prior to the study&#xD;
      commencing by the investigator. As clubs were recruited and workshops were scheduled,&#xD;
      assignment of the interventions were applied by the investigator to workshop facilitators&#xD;
      prior to workshop delivery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures Soccer NMT Warm-up Program The soccer NMT warm-up program is a modified version of&#xD;
      a NMT warm-up program developed by Finnish researchers for floorball and soccer by Pasanen et&#xD;
      al. (2008). This program is also a slightly modified version of the presently used SHRed&#xD;
      Injuries NMT warm-up program. The current soccer NMT program consists of nine, level one&#xD;
      exercises divided into four categories: aerobic, agility, strength, and balance where most&#xD;
      exercises have the option to increase the difficultly as shown by the level two options.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Peer to Peer Learning Tablet Application The P2P learning tablet-based application is an&#xD;
      application used to facilitate the comprehension and execution of various movement patterns.&#xD;
      This is the technology that will be used in the intervention workshop. For each movement&#xD;
      pattern or exercise, the application requires two individuals to partner up where one is the&#xD;
      subject performing the exercise in the video recorded (video not to be stored on the&#xD;
      application or device) and the other individual records the video. Prior to recording any&#xD;
      video, the partners observe a correct exercise demonstration video and a list of key criteria&#xD;
      or key components for every exercise that has to be met in order for the exercise to be&#xD;
      performed correctly. One person in the partnership is filmed performing the exercise. The&#xD;
      subject and their partner are then able to view the video, evaluate it and discuss if the&#xD;
      subject was able to perform each component correctly, incorrectly or partially correct. The&#xD;
      partners then switch roles. Application users are then able to improve their execution and&#xD;
      understanding of the exercise by evaluating themselves and their partner through the&#xD;
      application.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection Two types of soccer NMT workshops were offered. The intervention group&#xD;
      received the technology integrated instruction workshop which was a two-hour workshop that&#xD;
      included information on injury risks and NMT, on field exercise instruction with instruction&#xD;
      on how to use the P2P learning tablet application followed by partnered practice with use of&#xD;
      the application for all soccer NMT warm-up exercises. The control group received the standard&#xD;
      in person instruction workshop (without technology). This was a two-hour workshop that&#xD;
      included information on injury risks and NMT, on field instruction and partnered practice for&#xD;
      all soccer NMT warm-up exercises. A pilot intervention workshop occurred (n=3) to optimize&#xD;
      the workshop's delivery. All coaches were provided with copies of the soccer NMT warm-up&#xD;
      program with pictures of all the exercises with required repetitions and supplementary&#xD;
      materials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data was collected at the beginning and the end of the soccer NMT warm-up workshops. At the&#xD;
      beginning, participants consented, provided basic demographic information and completed the&#xD;
      soccer NMT warm-up exercise self-efficacy questionnaire. Following the completion of the&#xD;
      workshop, participants completed the soccer NMT warm-up exercise self-efficacy questionnaire&#xD;
      again, and the soccer NMT warm-up exercise test.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures The outcomes of this study are assessing the change in coaches' self-efficacy and&#xD;
      ability to identify exercise errors. In addition, basic demographic information was collected&#xD;
      to allow to describe the sample and use advanced statistical analysis methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self- Efficacy Scale Soccer NMT warm-up exercise self-efficacy questionnaire was developed as&#xD;
      a nine item 7 point Likert scale. This scale was developed to assess coaches (in lay terms)&#xD;
      confidence to recognize incorrect exercise execution for each exercise. Coaches were&#xD;
      presented with the stem question &quot;How confident are you in your ability to see mistakes when&#xD;
      as athlete performs the exercise…&quot; followed by the name of each of the evaluated level one&#xD;
      exercises within the Soccer NMT Warm-up program. The Likert scale ranged from Not Confident&#xD;
      at All to Somewhat Confident to Completely Confident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Coaches were asked to complete the mobile administered scale at the beginning of the workshop&#xD;
      prior to being introduced to the exercises. To eliminate any confusion about exercises that&#xD;
      have multiple names for example, coaches watched a short video introducing what the exercises&#xD;
      are and the names for them being used in the soccer NMT warm-up. Coaches were asked again to&#xD;
      complete the scale at the end of the workshop after learning the exercises. At both time&#xD;
      points, the mean of the nine items was taken to score the scale. The change in coaches'&#xD;
      self-efficacy was calculated by taking the difference between time points for each&#xD;
      participant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video-based Exercise Test Soccer NMT warm-up exercise test was created to provide an&#xD;
      objective measure of coaches' ability to recognize incorrect exercise execution of the soccer&#xD;
      NMT warm-up exercises. 16 multiple choice questions with four response options were&#xD;
      developed. For each question, participants needed to watch a video of an athlete performing&#xD;
      one execution error for one of nine level one exercises. The participants were asked to&#xD;
      identify which component of the exercise is being performed incorrectly by selecting the&#xD;
      false response option. The response options for these exercises were modified from the&#xD;
      performance criteria components of the SHRed Basketball Warm-up Observational Tool. The tool&#xD;
      breaks down an exercise to its essential components to assess fidelity, whether an athlete is&#xD;
      performing an exercise correctly by all of its components. The responses stem from the tool&#xD;
      as many of the basketball and soccer NMT warm-up exercises are the same and the tool was also&#xD;
      used to assess exercise fidelity through video analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An example of a question is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A total of 16 points was allotted for this test, one per correctly identified error. One to&#xD;
      two points per exercise was allotted for injury prevention focuses (11 points) and one to two&#xD;
      per exercise (five points) was allotted for the key execution components that are not&#xD;
      explicitly injury prevention focused.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Descriptive Statistics Demographic Information Participants who did not complete the&#xD;
      necessary forms fully or correctly were identified and removed. Demographic participant&#xD;
      information was screened to identify errors, missing data and/ or outliers. Data that could&#xD;
      be collected by following up with the participant was added. Missing demographic info was not&#xD;
      imputed. Soccer NMT warm-up exercise self-efficacy data with missing values were imputed with&#xD;
      the mean of the remaining items within the scale for when that participant's questionnaire&#xD;
      had at least half of the items completed. Internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha) was&#xD;
      calculated for the soccer NMT warm-up exercise self-efficacy questionnaire at both time&#xD;
      points. Intraclass correlation was calculated to estimate the degree of clustering between&#xD;
      soccer clubs for all outcomes. Data were analyzed using STATA 15.1 software. Data was&#xD;
      analyzed and summarized with descriptive statistics based on the workshop the coach attended&#xD;
      such as sample. Data that could be reported through measures of central tendency underwent&#xD;
      distribution assessment and were reported appropriately (means and standard deviations or&#xD;
      medians with ranges) such as soccer NMT warm-up exercise test scores, the change in mean&#xD;
      soccer NMT warm-up exercise self-efficacy scores, age and number of years coaching. Remaining&#xD;
      variables were reported as a dichotomous yes or no such as sex, previous injury prevention&#xD;
      program use, volunteer coach status, and personal training experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory Objectives Descriptive statistics by proportions were used to depict the&#xD;
      percentage of correctly identified errors by soccer NMT warm-up exercise test injury&#xD;
      prevention test focuses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Multivariable Analysis Primary Objectives Multiple linear regression analyses were used to&#xD;
      determine if an association existed between soccer NMT warm-up workshop attended (control vs&#xD;
      intervention workshop) and outcomes soccer NMT warm-up exercise test scores (score out of 16)&#xD;
      and the change in mean soccer NMT warm-up exercise self-efficacy scores (within the 7 point&#xD;
      Likert scale). These outcome variables are being assessed as continuous variables. Other&#xD;
      covariate variables to be included in both regression analyses were age (years), sex (male/&#xD;
      female), number of years coaching soccer (years), previous use of any injury prevention&#xD;
      program (yes/no), being volunteer coach (yes/no), soccer NMT warm-up exercise test scores or&#xD;
      the change in mean soccer NMT warm-up exercise self-efficacy if they were not the outcome of&#xD;
      that analysis and, were adjusted for any effects of clustering by club. All covariates in&#xD;
      these analyses were able to be potential modifiers and/or confounders in the regression&#xD;
      analyses, which were assessed using a backwards elimination process. Results were reported as&#xD;
      estimations of mean test scores and change in mean self-efficacy scores for the final models&#xD;
      from the linear regression analyses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Statistical significance level for all analysis was set at 5% (alpha=0.05). The outcomes of&#xD;
      this study are novel thus sample size is unable to be determined by calculation. However, an&#xD;
      estimate of 10 participants per beta coefficient included in the model was used to estimate a&#xD;
      feasible sample size of n=100 (50 per group) as per statistician recommendation. In addition,&#xD;
      based on previous studies conducted in Calgary through the Sport Injury Prevention Research&#xD;
      Centre, typically the most amount of coaches to have participated in CMSA soccer related&#xD;
      studies is 60 coaches.&#xD;
