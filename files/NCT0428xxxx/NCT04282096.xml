  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There are different types of casein on the market, which differ according to their chemical&#xD;
      or physical process of obtaining. The processes will impact structural differences in the&#xD;
      macromolecular assembly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The majority of caseins marketed in nutrition are casein in the form of Na caseinate or Ca&#xD;
      caseinate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The micellar caseins obtained by membrane filtration (physical process) are more and more&#xD;
      used in the nutrition market.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The development of casein extraction with different structures on an industrial scale opens&#xD;
      up other perspectives for these proteins, particularly in terms of health.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this project is to study the postprandial kinetics of the plasma&#xD;
      concentrations of the essential amino acids of three structurally different types of caseins.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective is to study the speed of gastric emptying and the nutritional&#xD;
      properties of different proteins.&#xD;

      All the participants will give freely their written informed consent before their selection&#xD;
      in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will participate in 3 kinetics of 5 hours with a different product test each&#xD;
      time, in a randomized order. A wash-out period of at least 7 days will be respected between&#xD;
      each kinetics. The products to be tested will be in the form of a powder (25g individual&#xD;
      sachet, including 20.1g of protein) which will be reconstituted in 250ml of water and to&#xD;
      which 100mg of 13C sodium acetate will be added.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each of the kinetics, blood samples, expires gasses, will be collected at different time&#xD;
      during the kinetics. A urinary collection throughout the day of kinetics will also be&#xD;
      performed to allow the determination of urinary nitrogen Indirect calorimetry measurements&#xD;
      will be performed 45 minutes every hour in the postprandial period and a measurement of 45&#xD;
      minutes will be made when the subject is fasting. Six measurements of indirect calorimetry&#xD;
      will be performed for each kinetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally subjects will be asked to evaluate their satiety on a visual analog scale, 15' before&#xD;
      taking the product, then every 15' the first hour in the postprandial period and every 30&#xD;
      'from the 2nd hour.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The subjects will also have a tolerance questionnaire to complete with each kinetic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the kinetics, a standardized meal, single menu, consumption ad libitum measured&#xD;
      in double weighing will be proposed to the volunteers to evaluate their satiety&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the 3 days preceding each kinetics, the protein intake of the subjects will be&#xD;
      controlled. The meal of each night in the evening of kinetics will be standardized and&#xD;
      identical for each kinetics. The volunteers will complete a food survey on the 3 days of&#xD;
      control of their diet that precede each kinetics.&#xD;
