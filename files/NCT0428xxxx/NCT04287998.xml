  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  Preeclampsia (PE) is a diverse multisystem syndrome defined as a new onset of&#xD;
           hypertension along with evidence of significant multiorgan dysfunction in previously&#xD;
           normotensive women 20 weeks of gestation (1)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The incidence of PE is around 2 - 8 % of pregnancies and it causes about 50,000 deaths&#xD;
           worldwide every year (2).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  In Egypt, it complicates 6% - 8% of pregnancies (3).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placentation processes include trophoblastic invasion, vascularization of trophoblast to&#xD;
           establish and maintain feto-placental vasculature, and subsequent maternal vascular&#xD;
           remodeling (4). Extravillous trophoblastic (EVT) cells are crucial for this process (5).&#xD;
           If the function of extravillous trophoblast cells is deficient, it can result in PE (6).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  PI3K/AKT pathway plays important roles in placental development and fetal growth (7).&#xD;
           PI3K/AKT signaling pathway is important for cell proliferation, migration, invasion and&#xD;
           glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (8). AKT can further activate different downstream factors,&#xD;
           which plays a predominant role in angiogenesis, vascular permeability and migration (9).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matrix metalloproteinase (MMPs) are essential proteases for trophoblast invasion and&#xD;
           migration as they promote degrading of the extracellular matrix improving the the cell&#xD;
           invasion, while the tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) are normal&#xD;
           tissue proteins that inhibit the action of MMPs (10).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Annexin A4 (ANXA4) has been shown to participate in regulation of cellular growth,&#xD;
           invasion, and apoptosis. ANXA4 has role in many forms of cancer (11). It was found that&#xD;
           ANXA4 expression was downregulated in PE placentas compared with the normal placentas.&#xD;
           However, the exact role of ANXA4 in the invasion and survival of trophoblast cells&#xD;
           remains less understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  ANXA4 binds to the plasma membrane in a Ca2+- dependent manner and regulates its&#xD;
           downstream signaling transduction, including phosphoinositide-3-kinase PI3K/AKT&#xD;
           signalling (12).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Matrix-remodelling associated 5 (MXRA5) is a member of the MXRA protein family,&#xD;
           participating in cell adhesion and extracellular matrix remodelling (13). This protein&#xD;
           is expressed in primates but not in rat or mouse. The function of this protein remains&#xD;
           elusive. It resembles the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor and has&#xD;
           anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrotic properties (14). Somatic mutations of MXRA5 are&#xD;
           found in non-small cell lung cancer and in colorectal cancer (15).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The expression of MXRA5 was shown to be downregulated in the placentae of PE patients&#xD;
           which consequently leads to the inhibition of PI3k/AKT pathway (16).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  As regard that both of ANXA4 and MXRA5 downregulate PI3k/AKT pathway, they are&#xD;
           associated to be linked to the pathogenesis of PE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Endothelial glycocalyx (EG), the most important protective structure of the endothelium,&#xD;
           is an external layer of endothelial cells composed of different proteoglycans (PGs),&#xD;
           glycoproteins, glycolipids, and glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). The protective role of EG for&#xD;
           endothelium includes for example maintenance of tissue integrity, prevention of&#xD;
           leukocytes and platelet adhesion and antithrombotic activity (17). Examples of clinical&#xD;
           consequences of EG damage are albuminuria and edema (18).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Syndecan-1 (SDC-1) is one of the important PGs of EG (19).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lead (Pb) is a widespread heavy metal pollutant. Excess Pb in the environment is usually&#xD;
           produced via anthropogenic activities, such as mining and untreated sewage irrigation&#xD;
           water (20).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Arsenic (Ar) is a major toxicant in the environment, and a high level of exposure&#xD;
           carries an increased risk of cancers and many disorders (21).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Both of lead and arsenic have been proven to inhibit the PI3K/AKT pathway (22), (23). In&#xD;
           this study, lead (Pb) and arsenic (Ar) will be linked to PE through inhibition of&#xD;
           PI3K/AKT pathway.&#xD;
