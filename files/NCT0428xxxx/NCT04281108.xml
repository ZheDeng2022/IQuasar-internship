      This is a 2-part randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an open-label&#xD;
      extension (OLE) of APT-1011 in adults with EoE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will evaluate the efficacy and safety of APT-1011 3 mg administered HS for the&#xD;
      induction of response to treatment (histologic and symptomatic) over 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part B will evaluate histological relapse-free status in patients re-randomized to continue&#xD;
      APT-1011 or placebo (active treatment withdrawal) until Week 52.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part C, the OLE, will continue until regulatory approval of APT-1011 or Sponsor termination&#xD;

      This is a 2-part randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study followed by an OLE of&#xD;
      APT-1011 in adults with EoE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part A will evaluate the efficacy and safety of APT-1011 3 mg administered HS for the&#xD;
      induction of response to treatment (histologic and symptomatic) over 12 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 14, subjects will move into Part B. Subjects with histological response to APT-1011,&#xD;
      defined as ≤6 peak eos/HPF, will be re-randomized to continue APT-1011 or receive placebo&#xD;
      (active treatment withdrawal). APT-1011 histological non-responders will continue APT-1011,&#xD;
      and placebo histological non-responders will receive APT-1011 3 mg HS. Placebo histological&#xD;
      responders will continue placebo. Histological responder status will be determined at the&#xD;
      time of esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD) in Part B (at or prior to Week 52, depending on&#xD;
      unscheduled EGDs performed when the Investigator deems the subject's symptoms necessitate&#xD;
      EGD) and is defined as ≤6 peak eos/HPF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At Week 52, subjects may enter Part C, an open-label single-arm extension phase, and continue&#xD;
      study drug uninterrupted. Part C will terminate upon regulatory approval of APT-1011 or&#xD;
      Sponsor termination of the study.&#xD;

             safety risk to the subject such as uncontrolled diabetes or hypertension&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. History or presence of oral or esophageal mucosal infection whilst using inhaled or&#xD;
             nasal corticosteroids&#xD;
