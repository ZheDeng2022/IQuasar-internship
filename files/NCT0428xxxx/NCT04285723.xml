  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The study is a site-based retrospective non-interventional medical chart review of pediatric&#xD;
      and adult male and female patients with PIK3CA-Related Overgrowth Spectrum (PROS).&#xD;
      Patient-level data are abstracted from medical charts of all eligible patients at all&#xD;
      participating sites.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information from patients treated with alpelisib is used to describe the efficacy and safety&#xD;
      of alpelisib in PROS patients.&#xD;
