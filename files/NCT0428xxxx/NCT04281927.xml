  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Diagnostic accuracy of a wearable system for atrial fibrillation detection</measure>
    <time_frame>PPG will be assessed in 2 minutes. ECG will be assessed in up to 10 months.</time_frame>
    <description>The wearable system comprises of two integrated components: a photoplethysmography (PPG) and a 6-lead ECG of the device. It works as described below.&#xD;
First, an automatic PPG algorithm will indicate whether atrial fibrillation is suspected. The rhythm assessment of PPG algorithm is based on pulse regularity.&#xD;
Next, a 6-lead ECG is acquired by the wearable. The rhythm assessment of ECG is based on P waves and regularity of QRS complexes. A diagnosis is made by independent cardiologists.&#xD;
The conclusion of a whole system comprising of both described methods will be compared with a gold standard multi-lead Holter ECG. This standard ECG is also evaluated by independent cardiologists.</description>

    <description>An automatic PPG algorithm will indicate whether atrial fibrillation is suspected. The rhythm assessment of PPG algorithm is based on pulse regularity. As a separate diagnostic tool it will be compared with a gold standard multi-lead Holter ECG which is assessed by independent cardiologists.</description>

    <description>Independent cardiologists will assess the heart rhythm in a 6-lead ECG acquired by the wearable. As a separate diagnostic tool it will be compared with a gold standard multi-lead Holter ECG which is also assessed by independent cardiologists.
