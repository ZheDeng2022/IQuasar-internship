  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective study was to assess chronic pain 3, and 12 months after&#xD;
      cesarean delivery in a cohort of women in University hospital La Paz. We also aim to study&#xD;
      the possible contribution of anesthetic and surgical risk factors for the development of&#xD;
      Chronic post-surgical pain after cesarean (PCSCP)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      -  This prospective observational cohort study was conducted at University hospital La Paz.&#xD;
           Women hospitalized for cesarean section from March 2017 to September 2018 were recruited&#xD;
           on the hospital on the day of surgery, when research interviewers were available.&#xD;
           Patients who agreed to participate were interviewed in person preoperatively,at&#xD;
           discharge from Reanimation and 24 h postoperatively. Telephone follow-up interviews were&#xD;
           conducted one week and 3,and 12 months following surgery. Intraoperative information was&#xD;
           collected from the patient record or directly filled by a research person.&#xD;
           Questionnaires applied in the present study are reflected in file 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study participants had to be aged between 18 and 50 years and American Society of&#xD;
           Anesthesiologists scale (ASA) had to be I, II or III The exclusion criteria were history&#xD;
           of major psychiatric disorder and inability to undertake a personal or telephone&#xD;
           interview, ASA&gt; III or dead fetus as result of caesarean section. The study was approved&#xD;
           by the local ethics committee (registration number: PI-2564), and written informed&#xD;
           consent was obtained from all patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Questions about age, race, gestational age, toxic habits, body mass index (BMI) (that was&#xD;
      calculated from height and weight) previous vaginal delivery, cesarean delivery, other&#xD;
      demographic, medical, surgical, and pre- operative pain variables were included.&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Were also recruited information about urgency level of caesarean using the classification&#xD;
      proposed by Lucas et al.use of preoperative oxytocin, anesthesic technique before caesarean&#xD;
      section (for example epidural for labor) and surgical and anesthesia variables.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were visited within 24 h after surgery. Pain intensity was assessed as average pain&#xD;
      at rest and on movement during the past 24 h using (NRS) and DN2 questionnaire. Also&#xD;
      analgesic consumption and relevant side effects or complications were annotated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment after 3, and 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      -Patients were contacted by telephone by one of the authors at 3, and 12 months following&#xD;
      cesarean section. This telephone interview usually takes no longer than 15 min. Chronic&#xD;
      postsurgical pain (CPSP) was measured using the short form Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) BPI&#xD;
      assesses the severity of pain and its impact on functioning. The pain severity items are&#xD;
      presented as numeric rating scale (NRS). The patients were asked to rate their pain at rest&#xD;
      and during movement in the previous week of the survey. Items of pain interference on&#xD;
      function (general activity, mood, walking, work, relations with others, sleep and enjoyment&#xD;
      of life ) are also presented as numeric rating scale (NRS) , are valued with 0 = does not&#xD;
      interfere and 10 = interferes completely. There were also questions consumption of analgesics&#xD;
      and neuropathic pains symptoms using Neuropathic pain (DN2) questionnaire.&#xD;

    <description>Asses chronic pain 3 months after cesarean delivery in a cohort of women in University Hospital La Paz.A telephone interview with DN2 questionnaire was performed to all patients one week after surgery to assess the presence of neuropathic pain. CPSP diagnosis was retained in patients with the persistence of any symptom of pain or discomfort in the surgical site in the previous week, with an NRS score superior to 3/10 at rest and/or during movement 3 months after surgery.</description>
