      The prevalence of liver steatosis, steatohepatitis, fibrosis, and hemosiderosis in overweight&#xD;
      and obese US Military dependent pediatric patients using MR Elastography and Quantitative MRI&#xD;

      The purpose of this prospective study is to determine the prevalence NAFLD and of factors&#xD;
      that have been associated with the diagnosis of fatty liver disease in overweight and obese&#xD;
      children and adolescents and to determine the effectiveness of an intervention. In order to&#xD;
      do this, we will also compare laboratory values and the ability/feasibility of new magnetic&#xD;
      resonance technologies to first detect fatty liver disease and then to detect a difference in&#xD;
      liver health between pediatric patients with a normal BMI and those with a BMI â‰¥85%. This&#xD;
      study will consist of two phases and a reproducibility arm involving 19 voluntary subjects&#xD;
      from Phase 1 and the control group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase I:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To determine the prevalence and relative risk of liver fibrosis, steatosis,&#xD;
      steatohepatitis and hemosiderosis in overweight and obese US Military dependents between ages&#xD;
      10 and 17 compared with normal weight controls using specialized MRI (LMS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To compare results between MRI-LMS and MRE and to determine feasibility of one versus&#xD;
      the other technology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 3: To compare liver health of controls and overweight/obese subjects to determine if&#xD;
      there is a difference between groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 4: To test for various biomarkers that have been shown to have an association with NASH&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase II:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: To evaluate the effectiveness of a nine month intervention consisting of diet and&#xD;
      exercise education on the maintenance or reduction of liver steatosis, steatohepatitis, and&#xD;
      fibrosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: To establish whether early imaging can predict short-term clinical outcomes (eg&#xD;
      development of pre-diabetes, worsening NAFLD, development of NASH, or a change in liver&#xD;
      stiffness or fibrosis as measured by MRE and LMS, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Reproducibility Arm Aim 1: To evaluate the consistency of the LMS/MRE data.&#xD;
