      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis (blood poisoning) is a clinical syndrome characterised by a dysregulated host response&#xD;
      to infection causing life-threatening organ dysfunction which results in admission to an&#xD;
      intensive care unit. It typically shows an initial harmful inflammation resulting from the&#xD;
      immune system's overreaction to a severe infection. It is a major healthcare problem,&#xD;
      affecting millions of people worldwide. In the UK, it kills over 37,000 people/year, costing&#xD;
      the NHS Â£2.5 billion a year, and is increasing in incidence. Despite extensive efforts to&#xD;
      tackle this burden, at present, however, there are no specific and effective therapies for&#xD;
      this illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sepsis is a potentially life-threatening condition caused by a severe infection. When someone&#xD;
      develops sepsis, inflammation occurs not just at the site of the infection but throughout the&#xD;
      whole body. This widespread inflammation can be very harmful. It is known that similar&#xD;
      responses occur in other conditions, not relating to infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are recruiting patients with severe infections causing organ failure (also&#xD;
      known as severe sepsis/ septicaemia and septic shock) and also patients where widespread&#xD;
      inflammation, not related to infection, causes organ failure. In this study the investigators&#xD;
      hope to find out whether certain groups of genetic and blood based protein markers of sepsis&#xD;
      can forewarn the clinicians to this condition and also highlight patients who are responding&#xD;
      well to the treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Although it is known that the majority of the patients suffering from sepsis will survive&#xD;
      their ICU stay and leave the hospital alive, there is insufficient data how these patients do&#xD;
      on a longer term, i.e. after some time at home. To date there is little information on the&#xD;
      ability of the observed genetic and blood based protein markers to predict the functional&#xD;
      status of the patients surviving these conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Sepsis, defined as life threatening organ failure resulting from a dysregulated host response&#xD;
      to infection, remains a leading cause of death in critically ill patients and has been&#xD;
      included as a health priority in a 2017 WHO resolution. Diagnosis of this disorder is&#xD;
      challenging because the clinical signs and symptoms of systemic inflammation in sepsis&#xD;
      overlap with those of non-infectious critical conditions i.e. severe inflammatory response&#xD;
      syndrome (SIRS) e.g. cardiac arrest and burns. Early and accurate diagnosis of sepsis is&#xD;
      critical for improving patient outcomes and reducing antibiotic usage. Delays in antibiotic&#xD;
      administration are associated with worse outcomes; however paradoxically, indiscriminate&#xD;
      prescription of antibiotics to patients without bacterial infections increases both rates of&#xD;
      morbidity and antimicrobial resistance. The rate of inappropriate antibiotic prescriptions in&#xD;
      the hospital setting is estimated at 30 to 50% and would be decreased by access to improved&#xD;
      diagnostic tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is currently no gold standard laboratory test that can broadly determine the presence&#xD;
      and type of infection. Although new polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based molecular&#xD;
      diagnostics can profile pathogens directly from blood culture, they suffer from sensitivity&#xD;
      issues due to dependence on sufficient numbers of pathogens in the blood sample. They are&#xD;
      also limited to detection of a discrete range of pathogens. As a result, there is a growing&#xD;
      focus on molecular diagnostics that profile the host immune response. Current sepsis&#xD;
      groupings are based on clinical criteria such as the presence of shock, infection source, or&#xD;
      organ failure, but such groupings may not represent the underlying biology driving the host&#xD;
      response. They have also failed to adequately match patients for novel interventions. If the&#xD;
      heterogeneity of sepsis truly reflects heterogeneity in the host response, characterisation&#xD;
      of these underlying host response types will be fundamental to enabling precision sepsis&#xD;
      therapeutics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In a previous multi-centre, clinical-temporal study in three cohorts of patients admitted to&#xD;
      the intensive clinical care unit (ICU); (i) out of hospital cardiac arrest (n=36 - SIRS&#xD;
      group)) (ii) pulmonary sepsis (n=84) (iii) abdominal sepsis (n=64) and 30 healthy controls,&#xD;
      validated potential host immune biomarkers. Using 202 samples from these cohorts, the&#xD;
      investigators derived a set of gene biomarkers which can identify patients with severe&#xD;
      inflammation and discriminate sepsis from non-infected inflammation across a broad range of&#xD;
      clinical conditions. Other biomarkers have been identified for use for other purposes e.g.&#xD;
      prognosis/severity. Our patent arising from this work has been filed and entered PCT stage.&#xD;
      From these patented markers a parsimonious set of 17 genes has been further delineated, which&#xD;
      are under further evaluation. A sub-panel of two gene entities has been identified that can&#xD;
      accurately detect severe inflammation using receiver operating characteristic/area under the&#xD;
      curve (ROC) analysis with a value of approximately 0.98. A panel of three/four gene entities&#xD;
      has been identified for discrimination of SIRS from all sepsis types (ROC 0.89-0.92), all&#xD;
      depending on sensitivity or specificity range settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Better diagnostics for sepsis-driven inflammation are needed in both inpatient and outpatient&#xD;
      settings. In low-acuity outpatient settings, contributing circa 80% of total UK antibiotic&#xD;
      use, a simple diagnostic to discriminate a septic inflammatory process from an innocuous,&#xD;
      self-limiting condition, would assist in appropriate antimicrobial use, appropriate triage,&#xD;
      avoiding further investigations, and appropriate escalation / admissions. In higher-acuity&#xD;
      settings, causes of non-infectious inflammation are important to exclude; a decision model&#xD;
      for antibiotic prescription should include a non-infected, non-healthy cause. A reliable&#xD;
      diagnostic, such as ours, needs to distinguish all three presentations: non-infected&#xD;
      inflammation, sepsis, and relative health. It will represent a major step-change in provision&#xD;
      of diagnostic/stratification capability, vastly improve decision and patient management&#xD;
      pathways and potentially reducing antibiotic overuse in the acute medical and critical-care&#xD;
      environment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These biomarkers once validated in an independent cohort via qPCR for mRNA and their&#xD;
      commensurate proteins, together with an accompanied easy-to-use, clinically oriented scoring&#xD;
      system will represent a complete data package which can be rolled out internally, subject to&#xD;
      the appropriate further accreditation and/or leveraged for development of point-of-care&#xD;
      devices by commercial partners. This latter option could prove useful for dissemination of&#xD;
      the test to other patent-appropriate global territories.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is an urgent need to validate these findings in several ways; Using an independent&#xD;
      patient cohort, where laboratory scientists are blinded to the clinical phenotypes of the&#xD;
      recruited patients and clinicians are not aware of the gene expression data.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a bioinformatics approach to validate the results in already published datasets&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will use different approaches to validate these novel SIRS or sepsis-associated&#xD;
      biomarkers identified by Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and parametric data mining of&#xD;
      previously published datasets and further validated previously from a previous well&#xD;
      characterised clinical cohort;&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Public Health England laboratories will assess biomarker mRNA expression using a qPCR&#xD;
           approach, with RNA purified from patient and control whole blood&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Public Health England and Cardiff laboratories will assess protein biomarkers using&#xD;
           ELISA assays&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Proteomic analysis of blood by external collaborators&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further data analysis will be conducted using ROC curve analysis and arithmetic algorithms&#xD;
      and/or other statistical/bioinformatics methods. Assessment of specificity and sensitivity&#xD;
      and positive and negative predictive values using well established methods will also be&#xD;
      conducted to evaluate the performance of the biomarker panels in discriminating patient&#xD;
      control and disease groups.&#xD;
