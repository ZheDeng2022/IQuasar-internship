    <textblock>
      The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of HCV, HBV, HIV testing (according to the&#xD;
      national guidelines) during consultation with Anesthesiologist before a planned surgery in&#xD;
      Lariboisiere Hospital, Paris, France. The feasibility will be the number of tested patients&#xD;
      divided by the number of patients who should have been tested according to the national&#xD;
      guidelines (for each virus).&#xD;

      The aim of the study is to assess the feasibility of HCV, HBV, HIV testing during&#xD;
      consultation with Anesthesiologist before a planned surgery in Lariboisiere Hospital, Paris,&#xD;
      France.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The national guidelines recommend at least one HIV testing during life and, more recently,&#xD;
      one HCV testing during life to eradicate HCV infection. HBV testing is recommended in&#xD;
      patients coming from high prevalence countries, IVDU, prisoners, patients with multiple&#xD;
      sexual partners.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The feasibility will be the number of tested patients divided by the number of patients who&#xD;
      should have been tested according to the national guidelines (for each virus).&#xD;
&#xD;
      HIV testing will use finger-stick whole blood (FSB) INSTI® HIV-1 &amp; HIV-2 Rapid Antibody Test&#xD;
      FSB (BioLytical TM Laboratories Inc., Richmond, B.C., Canada), with a sensitivity 99%&#xD;
      [96.3-99.7] and a specificity 99.3%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCV testing will use finger-stick whole blood (FSB) Oraquick® HCV test, with a sensitivity&#xD;
      and a specificity 99.1 and 100% respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HBV testing will use finger-stick whole blood (FSB) Vikia® HBs Ag test, bioMérieux with a&#xD;
      sensitivity and a specificity 96.5 and 99.9% respectively.&#xD;
