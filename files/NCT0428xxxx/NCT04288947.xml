    <textblock>
      Using a public health facility Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Ghana the overall goal of&#xD;
      the research is to examine: 1) the feasibility of implementing respectful care modules&#xD;
      (RMC-M) in Kumasi, Ghana; 2) whether exposure to RMC-M increases participants perception of&#xD;
      respectful maternity care in a public hospital setting in Ghana; and 3) the efficacy of RMC-M&#xD;
      in changing midwives' attitudes, behaviors and clinical practice patterns. To achieve Aim 1,&#xD;
      qualitative and quantitative study designs will be used to assess for reliability of&#xD;
      implementation, usefulness, and patient responsiveness. Based on data collected, feasibility&#xD;
      will be examined and the RMC-M will be further modified as needed prior to beginning Aim 2.&#xD;
      To achieve Aim 2, a two group study design will be used, with one group of midwives receiving&#xD;
      training on the RMC- M and the other not receiving any training. Participants receiving care&#xD;
      from these two groups of midwives will be followed through intrapartum and surveyed&#xD;
      postpartum to examine their perceptions of the care they received. To achieve Aim 3, a&#xD;
      pre-post study design will examine whether expose to a RMC-M changes midwives' attitudes,&#xD;
      behaviors, and clinical care of participants during labor and delivery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a growing recognition of disrespectful and abusive care of pregnant women during&#xD;
      labor and delivery. Fear of maltreatment during labor and delivery has been identified as one&#xD;
      barrier that prevents pregnant women from delivering in a facility.[1-3]. Pregnant Women&#xD;
      report lack of sympathy and empathy, neglect, rudeness and verbally abusive behaviour,&#xD;
      physically abusive behavior, lack of temperamental control, inadequate attention, and lack of&#xD;
      privacy in skilled health care centres.[3,4] These form barriers to effective use of&#xD;
      facilities[3,5,6] for childbirth as pregnant women recount that they receive better health&#xD;
      care at home than in health facilities which is the only setting where skilled birth is&#xD;
      provided in Ghana. Additionally, facility-based childbirth is known to avert mortality&#xD;
      associated with deliveries which are often not detectable during prenatal care.[5,6]&#xD;
      Currently, 1500 women die daily in sub-Saharan Africa from complications related to&#xD;
      childbirth. [7,8] In the developing world, the life-time hazard of a woman dying from risks&#xD;
      associated with pregnancy and child-birth is more than 300 times greater than for a woman&#xD;
      living in a developed country; no other mortality rate has this disparity.[9] In Ghana, the&#xD;
      current maternal mortality ratio is 380 per 100,000 live births and only 42% of women receive&#xD;
      skilled childbirth care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four Respectful Maternity Care Modules (RMC-M) were developed from data collected during the&#xD;
      candidate's dissertation research on disrespect and abuse in intrapartum care at four public&#xD;
      hospitals in Ghana and from literature on the state of the science on disrespect and abuse.&#xD;
      The content for four evidence-based modules includes topics on: 1) respect and dignity in&#xD;
      childbirth; 2) communication; 3) focused antenatal care; and 4) use of alternative birthing&#xD;
      positions for delivery. The modules use interactive teaching and learning methods such as&#xD;
      role play, discussion, brain-storming, demonstration, and case study to discover acceptable&#xD;
      practices, skills, and attitudes for respectful care provision. The intervention has the&#xD;
      potential to improve pregnant women's experience of facility-based childbirth, therefore&#xD;
      increasing satisfaction and decreasing home delivery. The RMC-M is proposed for midwives&#xD;
      working in prenatal, intrapartum and postnatal facility-based childbirth units. Despite the&#xD;
      proposed strengths of the RMC-M as a tool to improve perceptions of maternity care with&#xD;
      facility-based childbirth, the fidelity and uptake of the intervention have not been tested.&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to test an intervention to promote respectful facility-based&#xD;
      maternity care that can be delivered by midwives in Ghana in a public hospital setting&#xD;
      through the following specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #1: Examine the feasibility of implementing respectful maternity care modules in&#xD;
      Kumasi, Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will assign 10 professional midwives to receive training on Respectful&#xD;
      Maternity Care Modules (RMC-M). During the training, we will use qualitative and quantitative&#xD;
      analytic techniques to examine the feasibility of implementing the RMC-M in Ghana focused on:&#xD;
      1) reliability of implementation, 2) usefulness, and 3) patient responsiveness. Based on data&#xD;
      collected, feasibility will be examined and the RMC-M will be further modified as needed&#xD;
      prior to beginning Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #2: Examine whether exposure to RMC-M increases Ghanaian women's perception of&#xD;
      respectful maternity care in a public hospital setting in Ghana.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to meet aim #2, a two-group comparison design will be used with one group of&#xD;
      pregnant women (n=62) receiving care from midwives trained in the RMC-M and the other group&#xD;
      of pregnant women (n=62) receiving care from midwives who received a four module program in&#xD;
      basic emergency obstetric and newborn care (BEmONC). Ten additional midwives will be trained&#xD;
      in BEmONC prior to data collection. Data will be collected from postpartum women on their&#xD;
      perception of intrapartum care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that postpartum women who receive care from midwives trained in the RMC-M&#xD;
      interventions will score higher on a RMC scale than those women in the comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim #3: Examine the efficacy of RMC-M in changing midwives' attitudes, behaviors,&#xD;
      and clinical practice patterns.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a pre-post study design to examine whether exposure to the RMC-M changes midwives'&#xD;
      attitudes, behaviors, and clinical practice in the care of women during labor and delivery.&#xD;
      The investigators will survey midwives prior to implementing training on the RMC-M and&#xD;
      following completion of aim #2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is hypothesized that midwives trained in the RMC-M interventions will have a significant&#xD;
      change in attitudes, behaviors, and clinical practice than those midwives in the comparison&#xD;
      group.&#xD;
