  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project aims to explore, in depth, the burden of hearing loss and tinnitus on cancer&#xD;
      survivors. Using semi-structured interviews, audiograms and a variety of validated&#xD;
      questionnaires, the specific impact ototoxicity has on quality of life will be investigated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From this, we can identify the specific needs of patients experiencing hearing loss and&#xD;
      tinnitus following chemotherapy and develop a tailored and personalised support system.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The medical and technological advances in cancer research have caused a decline in cancer&#xD;
      deaths in recent decades. For example, the 5-year survival rate now is above 80% for many&#xD;
      adult cancers, including breast and testicular cancers. In breast cancer alone, the mortality&#xD;
      rate has reduced 39% since 1989 and currently has a 5 year survival rate over 90%. Due to&#xD;
      this increase in survival rates and the intensity of treatment, many face long-term physical&#xD;
      and psychological challenges in survivorship. Cancer survivors may experience altered body&#xD;
      image and changes in sexual health and energy levels in addition to distress, anxiety, the&#xD;
      fear of recurrence and the chronic side effects of their treatment. The need to research the&#xD;
      long-term effects of chemotherapy and the impact they have on quality of life is crucial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is a need to broaden research beyond the survival rates and address the need for&#xD;
      support for those who are adapting to a life after cancer. Survivors are left with often&#xD;
      permanent and possible life-debilitating effects from treatment. To date, there has been&#xD;
      little research on the specific late effects of chemotherapy and the associated impact on&#xD;
      quality of life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Platinum-based chemotherapy, although highly effective, is known to cause ototoxicity,&#xD;
      presenting often as permanent high frequency hearing loss and tinnitus. Hearing loss and&#xD;
      tinnitus are associated with a higher risk of depression, social isolation and anxiety. The&#xD;
      quality of social interactions for a person with hearing loss and tinnitus is diminished as&#xD;
      taking part in conversations becomes challenging. This is particularly problematic as it&#xD;
      means that the quality of life of these cancer survivors is reduced.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The impact hearing loss and tinnitus has on quality of life in cancer survivors remains&#xD;
      unclear and under-studied. Because cancer therapies can potentially cause life-threatening&#xD;
      side effects such as cardiotoxicity and nephrotoxicity, these become the priority. However,&#xD;
      once these side acute effects subside, other long-term side effects remain and can&#xD;
      permanently reduce quality of life. Cancer survivors may have already experienced a difficult&#xD;
      journey from the diagnosis itself, the physical challenges of treatment and finally,&#xD;
      remission. Re-adapting back to their previous life whilst in remission, but with added&#xD;
      permanent side effects, both physically and psychologically, can be extremely difficult for&#xD;
      some survivors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, there is little information and support offered to these patients who suffer from&#xD;
      ototoxicity, potentially leading to many being undiagnosed and untreated. These patients can&#xD;
      be affected by this toxicity for the rest of their lives, which can have a detrimental impact&#xD;
      on their quality of life. It is essential that a deeper understanding and increased awareness&#xD;
      of how hearing loss and tinnitus affects the quality of life of cancer survivors is sought to&#xD;
      improve long-term symptoms management and support offered. This study aims to develop this&#xD;
      and improve the support given to cancer survivors.&#xD;
