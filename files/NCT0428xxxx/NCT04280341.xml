    <textblock>
      This is a non-randomized, open-label, single-arm, multicenter Phase I clinical trial which&#xD;
      will evaluate the Safety, Efficacy, Tolerability and Pharmacokinetics of RC48-ADC in&#xD;
      combinaton with Anti-PD1 Monoclonal Antibody in Treatment of HER2-Positive Advanced Malignant&#xD;
      Solid Tumors.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The study has 2 parts which include dose escalation phase and dose extension phase.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose escalation will use a 3+3 design and will enroll cohorts of 3-6 patients with&#xD;
      HER2-Positive Advanced Malignant Solid Tumors sequentially at escalating doses of 2.0mg/kg&#xD;
      and 2.5mg/kg to RC48-ADC and JS001 is fixed dose of 3.0mg/mg . Escalation will continue until&#xD;
      identification of a MTD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Dose of phase II and extenstion stage which based-results of escalation phase will be&#xD;
      recommend.&#xD;
