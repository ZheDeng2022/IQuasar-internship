      The purpose of this study is to investigate the prophylactic effects of psilocybin in chronic&#xD;
      cluster headache. Subjects will receive a low dose of psilocybin during 3 sessions spaced by&#xD;
      one week. Subjects will maintain a headache diary prior to, during, and after the&#xD;
      administrations in order to document headache frequency, intensity and duration. Subjects&#xD;
      will undergo a fMRI scanning before the first and after the last psilocybin session.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Cluster headache (CH) is one of the most painful conditions known. CH affects 1 out 1000 and&#xD;
      exists in two well-defined forms: episodic (ECH) and chronic (CCH). Ten to fifteen percent of&#xD;
      patients have CCH and have less than three months of pain-free time during a year. Medical&#xD;
      treatment for CH is divided into acute abortive treatment for the single attack and a&#xD;
      prophylactic treatment. The most commonly used prophylactic, verapamil, decreases attack&#xD;
      frequency but does not induce remission and very high doses are needed. Although most&#xD;
      therapeutic options ameliorate CH, they may be problematic due to major side effects,&#xD;
      unsatisfactory treatment response or availability. Thus, novel treatment options are needed.&#xD;
      According to several studies, patients that self-medicate with low doses of the serotonin 2A&#xD;
      receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist and psychedelic psilocybin report that this is effective as CH&#xD;
      prophylaxis or even to induce remission. So far, no clinical trials to confirm this have been&#xD;
      conducted, nor is there any objective measures of brain function in association with&#xD;
      psilocybin intake in CH. There is, however, already some evidence from functional magnetic&#xD;
      resonance (fMRI) imaging studies suggesting that CH patients have abnormal functional&#xD;
      connectivity patterns involving the hypothalamus and distributed brain networks, but the&#xD;
      implication of these abnormalities is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators are conducting a prospective pilot study, evaluating prophylactic effects&#xD;
      of psilocybin in CCH using an open-label study design. They're also going to investigate&#xD;
      psilocybin's active metabolite psilocin and brain function (fMRI) to identify possible brain&#xD;
      mechanisms underlying CCH and treatment response, including the correlation of treatment&#xD;
      response with psilocin levels and estimated 5-HT2AR occupancy and the extent to which brain&#xD;
      network changes are affected by psilocybin and correlated with treatment response.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effects of psilocybin on headache frequency, duration and intensity will be assessed in a&#xD;
      sample of 20 patients with CCH. Participants will fill out headache logs during the entire&#xD;
      study period, in total 10 weeks. Before study inclusion, participants taking prophylactic&#xD;
      medication will first go through a 2-week wash-out period to allow for elimination of the&#xD;
      medicine. Inclusion is followed by a baseline observation period lasting four weeks, after&#xD;
      which patients will first undergo a baseline rs fMRI scanning followed by the first dose of&#xD;
      0.14 mg/kg psilocybin p.o. Blood samples will be collected during the first psilocybin&#xD;
      intervention to establish psilocin plasma concentrations, which will be used for estimating&#xD;
      receptor occupancy. Participants will then undergo two additional psilocybin administrations&#xD;
      spaced by one-week. The last psilocybin dose will be followed by 4 weeks of observation. One&#xD;
      week after the last administration of psilocybin, participants will undergo a follow-up MRI&#xD;
      scan. Participants will be contacted 3, 6 and 12 months after the last psilocybin dose to&#xD;
      gain information about the duration of potential remission periods. All regular acute&#xD;
      treatments are permitted during the study period and a systematic record hereof has to be&#xD;
      noted in the headache diary. No other prophylactic medication is allowed during the trial and&#xD;
      at least a two-week washout period before inclusion is required. Prophylactics are allowed&#xD;
      again after the 4 weeks follow-up, with dose and type carefully recorded. Participants will&#xD;
      fill out questionnaires during the observation period, in conjunction with psilocybin&#xD;
      interventions and at follow-up.&#xD;
