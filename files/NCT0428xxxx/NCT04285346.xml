  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess preliminary safety and efficacy of ganaxolone as adjunctive therapy for the&#xD;
      treatment of primary seizure types in patients with genetically- or clinically-confirmed&#xD;
      TSC-related epilepsy through the end of the 12 week treatment period.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is an OL proof of concept study of adjunctive GNX treatment in patients with a confirmed&#xD;
      clinical diagnosis of TSC and/or a mutation in either the TSC1 or TSC2 gene. The trial&#xD;
      consists of two parts: Part A consists of a 4-week baseline period followed by a 12-week&#xD;
      treatment period (4-week titration and 8-week maintenance). For patients not continuing in&#xD;
      the 24-week OLE period (Part B), a 2-week taper period followed by a 2-week safety period&#xD;
      would follow. The main difference between Part A and Part B is the length of treatment, less&#xD;
      frequent assessments, and the ability to alter drug doses (both GNX and other antiepileptic&#xD;
      drug [AED] treatments which includes initiating and stopping other medications) based on&#xD;
      investigator evaluation of the patient's clinical course during Part B. Patients with a&#xD;
      seizure frequency reduction during the 12-week treatment period in Part A compared to&#xD;
      baseline may continue into Part B (&quot;OLE eligible&quot;), to assess long-term safety, efficacy and&#xD;
      tolerability in patients with TSC-related Epilepsy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria (Part A):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Clinical or mutational diagnosis of TSC&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Failure to control seizures despite appropriate trial of 2 or more ASMs at therapeutic&#xD;
             doses.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have at least 8 countable/witnessed primary seizures during the 4-week baseline period&#xD;
             with at least 1 primary seizure occurring in at least 3 of the 4 weeks of baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion Criteria (Part B)&#xD;
&#xD;
        • Patients have experienced ≥ 35% reduction in primary seizure frequency during the Part A&#xD;
        treatment period compared to the 4-week Baseline Period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria (Part A):&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Previous exposure to GNX&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant or breastfeeding&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent use of strong inducers or inhibitors of cytochrome P450 (CYP)3A4/5/7. Any&#xD;
             strong inhibitor or inducer of CYP3A4/5/7 must be discontinued at least 28 days before&#xD;
             Visit 2, study drug initiation. This does not include approved ASMs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have been taking felbamate for less than 1 year prior to screening&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who test positive for tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or non-approved cannabidiol&#xD;
             (CBD) via plasma drug screen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Chronic use of oral steroid medications, ketoconazole (except for topical&#xD;
             formulations), St. John's Wort, or other IPs is not permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have an active CNS infection, demyelinating disease, degenerative neurological&#xD;
             disease, or CNS disease deemed progressive. This includes tumor growth which in the&#xD;
             opinion of the investigator could affect primary seizure control&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with significant renal insufficiency, estimated glomerular filtration rate&#xD;
             (eGFR) &lt; 30 mL/min (calculated using the Cockcroft-Gault formula or Pediatric GFR&#xD;
             calculator or Bedside Schwartz), will be excluded from study entry or will be&#xD;
             discontinued if the criterion is met post baseline&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Have been exposed to any other investigational drug within 30 days or fewer than 5&#xD;
             half lives (whichever is shorter) prior to the screening visit&#xD;
