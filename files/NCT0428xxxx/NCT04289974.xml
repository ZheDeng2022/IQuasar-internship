    <textblock>
      This is a multi-center, observational study designed to explore the regulatory mechanism of&#xD;
      palbociclib correlative pathways in therapeutic process of breast cancer, employing next&#xD;
      generation sequencing (NGS) on DNA and RNA. This study also monitor the clonal evolution of&#xD;
      genes by tracing the ctDNA.&#xD;

    <description>100 cases of patients with ER+, HER2- breast cancer, experienced resistance after first line endocrinotherapy, will be assigned participants into treatment regimen, including palbociclib combined with fulvestrant.&#xD;
FFPE blocks/sections or fresh tumor tissues/biopsies will be obtained from the hospitals on the points before administration and since resistance appearance. The tissue will be sequenced by a pan-cancer DNA panel (500+ genes) and whole transcriptome sequencing (WTS).&#xD;
5-10 ml peripheral blood will be collected from each patient on the points before administration, 1 month after treatment, every subsequent visit and resistance appearance. The liquid biopsy will be sequenced by a pan-cancer ctDNA panel (300+ genes).&#xD;
The genomic characteristics of patients received resistance will be analyzed. The relevant pathway mechanisms will be identified.</description>
