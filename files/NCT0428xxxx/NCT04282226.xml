  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pain is a ubiquitous distressing sensory experience and is the most frequent symptom in&#xD;
      numerous gastrointestinal disorders including inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and irritable&#xD;
      bowel syndrome (IBS). Visceral pain is especially difficult to treat with conventional&#xD;
      medications and new treatments are needed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, the relationship between autonomic nerve system (ANS) and pain has gathered&#xD;
      attention because it could represent an effective treatment target for visceral pain. The&#xD;
      parasympathetic nervous system (PNS), one of the two main branches of the ANS, is considered&#xD;
      to play an important role for analgesia possibly due to vagal nerve-mediated activation of&#xD;
      key brain areas implicated in descending analgesia of pain. Transcutaneous vagal nerve&#xD;
      stimulation (tVNS) can non-invasively modulate vagal nerve and be expected as a new method to&#xD;
      treat visceral pain. For example, the preliminary study showed that vagal nerve stimulation&#xD;
      experimentally modulated cardiac vagal tone (CVT) and prevented the development of&#xD;
      acid-induced oesophageal hyperalgesia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Disturbances in ANS function have been reported not only in IBS patients but also in&#xD;
      fibromyalgia and chronic pelvic pain syndrome. Many of these disorders have been associated&#xD;
      with differences in brain structure and/or function as demonstrated by the use of structural&#xD;
      and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Of note, the investigators have recently&#xD;
      shown that these differences in brain structure and function may be in part attributable to&#xD;
      the aforementioned disturbance in ANS function, adding weight to the proposition that&#xD;
      autonomic neuromodulation may be efficacious in pain disorders. For instance, in healthy&#xD;
      participants the investigators have recently shown, using functional connectivity analysis,&#xD;
      that higher resting parasympathetic CVT predicts the engagement of a subcortical functional&#xD;
      network that is implicated in descending analgesia, thereby supporting the notion that&#xD;
      vagal-mediated analgesia is achieved via descending inhibitory pathways1,4. Thus, tVNS seems&#xD;
      a reasonable method to treat pain. However, to date, the precise real-time effect of tVNS on&#xD;
      brain function, including during the processing of visceral pain is unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence, the aims of this study are to investigate the real-time effect of tVNS compared to&#xD;
      sham stimulus on brain activity whilst experiencing acute oesophageal pain, using fMRI in&#xD;
      double-blind, randomised crossover study of tVNS vs sham stimulation in healthy subjects.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Following informed written consent and screening questionnaires to characterize&#xD;
      psychophysiological traits including personality and anxiety/depression inventory, each&#xD;
      subject will have a nasogastric tube inserted with the attached distensible balloon&#xD;
      positioned in the distal oesophagus. Painful oesophageal stimulation will be achieved by&#xD;
      inflation of the balloon to a pain threshold pre-determined in each subject, defined as the&#xD;
      point at which subject describes the transition from sensation to pain. The MR-safe tVNS&#xD;
      probe will be attached to the neck for cervical vagal nerve-directed tVNS, and subjects will&#xD;
      then be positioned in the MRI scanner. Real-time activity of the ANS will be monitored by&#xD;
      heart rate variability as described in the previous study, which has been adapted for use in&#xD;
      the MR-environment. All subjects will undergo MRI. For each visit, there will be two scanning&#xD;
      periods. High-resolution structural imaging will first be required, and subsequently resting&#xD;
      fMRI data will be acquired whilst subjects are asked to relax in the scanner, and their&#xD;
      baseline autonomic tone is monitored, using validated methods of acquiring ANS data. This&#xD;
      will illustrate a brain signature of real-time brain activity mapped to their parasympathetic&#xD;
      tone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will then be randomised to either the active-tVNS paradigm or sham and a second fMRI&#xD;
      data acquisition will then be performed so as to acquire brain activity in conjunction with&#xD;
      active and sham-tVNS. Following this, painful oesophageal stimulation will be repeated 20&#xD;
      times while active or sham tVNS continues. Following a two-week washout period, subjects will&#xD;
      be crossed over and re-examined to receive the intervention they did not receive in visit 1.&#xD;
