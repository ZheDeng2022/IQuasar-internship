  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      A growing number of trials have demonstrated treatment effectiveness for mental illness by&#xD;
      non-specialist providers, such as primary care providers, in low-resource settings. A barrier&#xD;
      to scaling up these evidence-based practices is the limited uptake from trainings into&#xD;
      service provision and lack of fidelity to evidence-based practices among non-specialists.&#xD;
      This arises, in part, from stigma among non-specialists against people with mental illness.&#xD;
      Therefore, interventions are needed to address attitudes among non- specialists. To address&#xD;
      this gap, REducing Stigma among HeAlthcare Providers to improvE Mental Health services&#xD;
      (RESHAPE), is an intervention for non-specialists in which social contact with persons with&#xD;
      mental illness is added to training and supervision programs. A cluster randomized control&#xD;
      trial will address primary objectives including changes in stigma (Social Distance Scale) and&#xD;
      improved quality of mental health services, operationalized as accuracy of identifying&#xD;
      patients with mental illness in primary care. The control condition is existing mental health&#xD;
      training and supervision for non-specialists delivered through the Nepal Ministry of Health's&#xD;
      adaptation of the World Health Organization mental health Gap Action Programme. The&#xD;
      intervention condition will incorporate social contact with people with mental illness into&#xD;
      existing training and supervision. Participants in the cluster randomized control trial will&#xD;
      be the direct beneficiaries of training and supervision (primary care providers) and indirect&#xD;
      beneficiaries (their patients). Primary care workers' outcomes include stigma (Social&#xD;
      Distance Scale), knowledge (mental health Gap Action Programme knowledge scale), implicit&#xD;
      attitudes (Implicit Association Test), clinical self-efficacy (mental health Gap Action&#xD;
      Programme knowledge scale), and clinical competence (Enhancing Assessment of Common&#xD;
      Therapeutic factors) to be assessed pre-training, post-training, and at 3- and 6-month&#xD;
      follow-up. Accuracy of diagnoses will be determined through the Structured Clinical Interview&#xD;
      for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version 5, which will be assessed at 3 months after&#xD;
      patient enrollment. Patient outcomes include functioning, quality of life, psychiatric&#xD;
      symptoms, medication side effects, barriers to care, and cost of care assessed at enrollment&#xD;
      and 3 and 6 months. This study will inform decisions regarding inclusion of persons living&#xD;
      with mental illness in training primary care providers.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There continues to be a major gap between the global burden of persons with mental illness&#xD;
      and the number of patients receiving adequate treatment. In the U.S. and other high-income&#xD;
      countries, approximately 1 out of 5 persons receives minimally adequate care. In lower-middle&#xD;
      income countries, it ranges from 1 out of 27 to 1 out of 100 persons. To address this gap in&#xD;
      low- and middle-income countries, a key strategy has been the use of primary care health&#xD;
      workers to detect and deliver of care for mental illness. The World Health Organization has&#xD;
      developed the mental health Gap Action Programme to train primary care workers to detect&#xD;
      mental illness and deliver evidence-supported treatment. However, research to date suggests&#xD;
      that implementation strategies for mental health Gap Action Programme are inadequate as&#xD;
      evidenced by low detection rates. In Nepal, fewer than half of persons with mental illness&#xD;
      were correctly identified by mental health Gap Action Programme-trained primary care workers.&#xD;
      A potential barrier to effective implementation of primary care detection is stigma among&#xD;
      primary care workers against persons with mental illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our preliminary work suggests that reducing primary care workers' stigma against persons with&#xD;
      mental illness may improve accurate detection of mental illness. A version of the mental&#xD;
      health Gap Action Programme training that includes a stigma reduction component was&#xD;
      developed: REducing Stigma among HealthcAre ProvidErs (RESHAPE). In RESHAPE, persons with&#xD;
      mental illness (i.e., service users) are trained to share recovery stories, conduct&#xD;
      myth-busting sessions, and promote mental health advocacy. A pilot cluster randomized&#xD;
      controlled trial was conducted in Nepal comparing standard mental health Gap Action Programme&#xD;
      training delivered psychiatrists and psychosocial specialists with a mental health Gap Action&#xD;
      Programme training delivered by both specialists and service users (RESHAPE). Consistent with&#xD;
      high-income country literature demonstrating that interaction with service users reduces&#xD;
      stigma more effectively that only providing knowledge, stigma was lower among the RESHAPE-&#xD;
      arm trained health workers. The pilot results also suggest that reducing stigma may improve&#xD;
      detection of mental illness. Therefore, involvement of mental health service users in&#xD;
      training primary care workers may reduce stigma, and that stigma reduction may mediate&#xD;
      improved detection of mental illness. If these findings are confirmed in an appropriately&#xD;
      powered cluster randomized controlled trial, this service user collaborative implementation&#xD;
      strategy could make a major contribution to improving primary care detection in low- and&#xD;
      middle-income countries, as well as in the U.S. A hybrid implementation-effectiveness&#xD;
      (type-3) cluster randomized controlled trial will be in Nepal comparing mental health Gap&#xD;
      Action Programme standard implementation with the RESHAPE implementation strategy. Our team&#xD;
      of U.S. and Nepali researchers, in partnership with the Nepal Ministry of Health,&#xD;
      demonstrated the feasibility of the cluster randomized controlled trial design and identified&#xD;
      strategies for cost effectiveness modeling. Target conditions will be depressive disorder,&#xD;
      psychotic disorders, and alcohol use disorder.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1 - To evaluate the impact of the RESHAPE service user engagement on stigma among primary&#xD;
      care workers. Hypothesis: Primary care workers in the RESHAPE arm will have less stigma&#xD;
      toward persons with mental illness (measured with the Social Distance Scale) 3 months after&#xD;
      training compared with primary care workers in the standard training.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2 - To evaluate the impact of the RESHAPE training on accuracy (sensitivity and&#xD;
      specificity) of detection, as measured by the proportion of true positive and true negative&#xD;
      diagnoses among patients presenting to primary care facilities, as confirmed by a&#xD;
      psychiatrist's structured clinical interview; and to evaluate stigma as a mediator of&#xD;
      differences in accuracy. Hypothesis: Primary care workers in the RESHAPE arm will have&#xD;
      greater accuracy of detecting mental illness. Secondary analyses: implementation arm&#xD;
      differences in patient quality adjusted life years and cost utility will be evaluated.&#xD;

    <intervention_model_description>This is a cluster randomized controlled trial with municipalities being the unit of randomization. 24 municipalities will be randomized to either RESHAPE or implementation as usual.

    <masking_description>There are two types of study participants: primary care providers and primary care patients. Based on the municipality of randomization, primary care providers will either participate in RESHAPE training or implementation as usual training. Patients will not be randomized because the health facilities they attend are already assigned to either having the primary care providers trained through RESHAPE or implementation as usual. The providers and patients will be masked to the implementation, i.e., they will not be given information on the differences in the two different implementation strategies. Research assistants and research psychiatrists who conduct the assessments will be masked to whether the provider or patients are in the RESHAPE or implementation-as-usual arms.</masking_description>
