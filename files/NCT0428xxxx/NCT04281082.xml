  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      To assess the occurrence of 11 SNP's in ABCB11 and ABCB4 genes in Greek women with ICP&#xD;
      compared with healthy pregnant women. Moreover, these genetic polymorphisms will be examined&#xD;
      in their first-degree relatives.&#xD;

      Introduction: ICP is commolnly manifested in the 2nd and especially in the 3rd trimester of&#xD;
      pregnancy. Pathogenesis of ICP is multifactorial implicating genetic, environmental and&#xD;
      hormonologic factors. Prevalence of ICP varies. In certain populations in latin America&#xD;
      occurrence of ICP is up to 15% of pregnancies. In Caucasian populations incidence of ICP is&#xD;
      approximately 1% of pregnancies. Data for the Greek population are scarce. Genes ABCB4 and&#xD;
      ABCB11 that are encoding transport proteins in the hepatocyte are implicated in the&#xD;
      pathogenesis of ICP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim of the Study: To study the genetic polymorphisms in pregnant women with ICP and in their&#xD;
      first degree relatives Patients and Methods: To recruit 100 women with ICP. Analyze the&#xD;
      occurrence of 11 SNP's in ABCB11 and ABCB4 genes in women with ICP. As control group will be&#xD;
      used pregnant women without ICP or known hepatic disease. In these women the same analysis&#xD;
      for SNP's as in women with ICP will be performed. Exclusion criteria: women with known&#xD;
      hepatic disease ( HBV, HCV, HIV, HEV, Autoimmune Hepatitis, Drug induced liver injury,&#xD;
      cirrhosis) and women with pregnancy related liver disease (pre-eclampsia, acute fatty liver&#xD;
      of pregnancy or HELLP syndrome) Inclusion criteria: pregnant women with ICP. Detailed report&#xD;
      of medical history, laboratory and clinical data regarding women and the pregnancy. Follow up&#xD;
      of laboratory values before and after the begging of treatment with UDCA.&#xD;
