  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) project is part of a larger project on potentially modifiable&#xD;
      risk factors for dementia in a life course perspective, with an overarching aim to improve&#xD;
      prevention of dementia and thereby potentially relieve patient and caregiver distress and&#xD;
      decrease societal load. The present PhD project will concentrate on confirming knowledge of&#xD;
      HI as an independent risk factor for dementia and exploring potentially causative factors to&#xD;
      explain this relationship.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Despite a huge increase in the knowledge about disease mechanisms in various types of&#xD;
      dementia in recent years, no curative treatment exists at present. Results from research on&#xD;
      disease-modifying agents have been disappointing. This has led to an increased interest in&#xD;
      other ways to reduce the prevalence of dementia. A recent report estimated that up to one&#xD;
      third of dementia cases could be delayed or prevented by interventions directed at the most&#xD;
      common risk factors. In the &quot;Lancet commission on dementia prevention, treatment, and care&quot;,&#xD;
      hearing impairment (HI) was identified as the potentially most important modifiable risk&#xD;
      factor. Even though HI is considered an important modifiable risk factor, the evidence&#xD;
      regarding the association between HI and dementia risk is still limited.&#xD;

        HUNT2 and HUNT4 hearing studies: Participants from 17 of the 24 municipalities in the&#xD;
        county were offered and accepted a hearing examination, consisting of pure-tone audiometry&#xD;
        and two questionnaires on hearing issues, such as use of hearing aids, noise exposure, and&#xD;
        tinnitus.&#xD;
