  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective sham study to investigate the role of transpyloric stenting with lumen&#xD;
      apposing metal stent (LAMS) as a predictor for clinical response to gastric per-oral&#xD;
      endoscopic pyloromyotomy (GPOEM) for refractory gastroparesis. The study hypothesizes that&#xD;
      clinical improvement with transpyloric stenting in patients with refractory gastroparesis is&#xD;
      a predictor of subsequent clinical success of GPOEM.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Gastroparesis is defined as a complex syndrome of symptoms including early satiety,&#xD;
      post-prandial fullness, nausea, vomiting, bloating, and upper abdominal pain with a&#xD;
      corresponding objective delay in gastric emptying in the absence of mechanical obstruction.&#xD;
      Recent epidemiologic data has shown a substantial increase of 158% in hospitalizations&#xD;
      related to gastroparesis in recent years. The pathogenesis underlying gastroparesis is&#xD;
      complex with multiple potential underlying mechanisms including impaired gastric&#xD;
      accommodation, autonomic neuropathy, vagal nerve injury, uncoordinated gastric contractility,&#xD;
      and pyloric dysfunction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Effective and durable medical treatment of gastroparesis has remained clinically challenging.&#xD;
      Currently metoclopramide is the only medication approved by the U.S. Food and Drug&#xD;
      Administration (FDA) for diabetic gastroparesis, and treatment courses are recommended to be&#xD;
      limited to a maximum of 12 weeks due to the risk of the irreversible side effect of tardive&#xD;
      dyskinesia. Surgical treatments for gastroparesis also remain limited, with sparse existing&#xD;
      data to support the use of implanted gastric electrical stimulation for treatment of&#xD;
      refractory gastroparesis, which is currently approved by the FDA only for compassionate use.&#xD;
      More recently, surgical pyloroplasty has been examined in treatment of gastroparesis, which&#xD;
      has long been recognized as a technique to improve gastric drainage for mechanical&#xD;
      obstructions and during elective vagotomy after gastric surgery. A recent study examined&#xD;
      surgical pyloroplasty in 28 patients with post-surgical gastroparesis with 83% patients&#xD;
      reporting significant clinical improvement at one-month follow-up but current surgical&#xD;
      literature remains limited in this area and has focused primarily on post-surgical&#xD;
      gastroparesis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the lack of effective treatment options, endoscopic therapies for gastroparesis have&#xD;
      recently been investigated as adjunctive or alternative methods to treat gastroparesis.&#xD;
      Pyloric dysfunction characterized by pyloric restriction or pylorospasm with prolonged&#xD;
      periods of increased pyloric tone and contractions has been brought to attention as an area&#xD;
      of targetable therapy for a subset of patients with gastroparesis. Pyloric botulinum toxin&#xD;
      injections initially demonstrated improvement in gastric emptying after treatment, but&#xD;
      subsequent results from double-blinded placebo-control studies failed to demonstrate a&#xD;
      difference in symptoms compared to placebo.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Transpyloric stenting was initially reported in 2013 in three cases of refractory&#xD;
      gastroparesis with placement of a double layered, fully-covered, Niti-S self-expandable metal&#xD;
      stent (TaeWoong Medical) across the pylorus with improvement in gastric emptying and symptoms&#xD;
      in all three patients. A subsequent study of 30 patients with refractory gastroparesis who&#xD;
      underwent transpyloric stenting demonstrated high technical success of stent placement (98%)&#xD;
      with improvement of clinical symptoms in 75% of patients and 4-hour gastric emptying studies&#xD;
      in 69% of patients. Stent migration was found to occur in 59% of patients without any&#xD;
      associated adverse events. Current focus on transpyloric stenting in gastroparesis centers&#xD;
      around determining optimal stent type and method of stent anchorage as well as the role of&#xD;
      transpyloric stenting in treatment given lack of long-term durability.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With advancements in endoscopic submucosal dissection, G-POEM has recently come in to light&#xD;
      as a minimally invasive technique to treat refractory gastroparesis. Esophageal endoscopic&#xD;
      myotomy has previously been well-described as a procedure for treatment of achalasia, and&#xD;
      this technique was adopted by in 2013 with the first G-POEM for refractory gastroparesis. A&#xD;
      subsequent multicenter study in 2017 reported on 30 patients with refractory gastroparesis&#xD;
      who underwent G-POEM with a technical success rate of 100%. At 5.5-month follow-up, 86% of&#xD;
      patients were found to have clinical response. Repeat gastric emptying studies after G-POEM&#xD;
      also normalized or improved in 47% and 37% of patients respectively. G-POEM has now gained&#xD;
      both national and international recognition in succeeding studies as a feasible and safe&#xD;
      technique to effectively treat refractory gastroparesis in a subset of patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Identifying predictors of success of G-POEM for treatment of gastroparesis is essential in&#xD;
      further recognizing appropriate patients who would benefit from this therapy. As transpyloric&#xD;
      stenting and G-POEM share underlying mechanisms of disruption of the pylorus, the&#xD;
      investigators propose that improvement with transpyloric stenting in patients with refractory&#xD;
      gastroparesis can be a predictor of subsequent response with G-POEM.&#xD;
