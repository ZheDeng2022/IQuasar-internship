    <textblock>
      Sleep behaviour has critical importance to health and wellbeing. A large body of evidence has&#xD;
      implicated poor sleep in all-cause mortality, and in cardiovascular and cardiometabolic risk&#xD;
      factors. Given the importance of sleep to health, the importance of accurately monitoring&#xD;
      sleep duration and quality is becoming more evident. Polysomnography (PSG) is considered the&#xD;
      gold standard for sleep assessment. Nevertheless, PSG is impractical, expensive and&#xD;
      labour-intensive. Another method to quantify indices of sleep is based on actigraphic&#xD;
      measures. Wrist worn actigraphy devices provide an indirect measure of sleep parameters e.g.&#xD;
      total sleep time, sleep onset latency and waking time. However, the data is in the form of&#xD;
      manufacturer-specific activity 'counts', making it difficult to compare the data with&#xD;
      different accelerometer brands. Recently wrist-worn accelerometers have become increasingly&#xD;
      used for objective measurement of physical activity in large population studies where&#xD;
      participants are often asked to wear them for 24 hours continuously. These devices therefore&#xD;
      collect data that could be used to estimate sleep parameters, and now there is a sleep&#xD;
      algorithm that can be applied to raw data from accelerometers. The three widely used raw-data&#xD;
      accelerometer brands are the Axivity, ActiGraph and GENEActiv and ActivPAL which is a&#xD;
      thigh-worn accelerometer that provides a measure of posture. Studies that examined accuracy&#xD;
      of estimating sleep parameters from different brands of accelerometers compared to PSG have&#xD;
      reported conflicting results which could be due to the use of different sleep algorithms and&#xD;
      accelerometer placement (dominant vs. non-dominant wrist vs. hip). Therefore this study will&#xD;
      aim to validate automated sleep algorithms for research grade accelerometers against PSG in a&#xD;
      clinical and healthy adult population.&#xD;

      Sleep behaviour has critical importance to health and wellbeing. Insufficient sleep duration&#xD;
      and poor sleep quality are independent contributors to high blood pressure and cardiovascular&#xD;
      disease, depression, obesity and diabetes. Given the importance of sleep duration and quality&#xD;
      to health, the importance of accurately monitoring sleep duration and quality in everyday&#xD;
      clinical practice is becoming more evident.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 'gold standard' physiological measure of sleep is sleep polysomnography (PSG). PSG is&#xD;
      used to quantify measures of sleep, including length of sleep, time taken to fall asleep,&#xD;
      sleep efficiency. The disadvantages of sleep PSG include the need to attend a laboratory, use&#xD;
      of expensive equipment, specialised staff to administer PSG, and to score and interpret the&#xD;
      PSG outputs, which limit its use in larger, or free-living studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another method to quantify indices of sleep is based on actigraphy, demonstrating 90%&#xD;
      agreement with polysomnography. Wrist actigraphy allows sleep assessment over several days&#xD;
      and measures daily sleep-wake cycles. However, the data is in the form of&#xD;
      manufacturer-specific activity 'counts' over a specific time window, making it difficult to&#xD;
      compare the data with different accelerometer brands. Recently wrist-worn accelerometers have&#xD;
      become increasingly used for objective measurement of physical activity in large population&#xD;
      studies where participants are often asked to wear them for 24 hours continuously, to&#xD;
      maximise compliance. These devices therefore collect data that could be used to estimate&#xD;
      sleep parameters, however to be able to use, pool or compare these data there is a need for&#xD;
      sleep algorithms that can be applied to datasets from different accelerometer brands. The&#xD;
      latest generation of accelerometers measure acceleration in universal units improving&#xD;
      comparability among different brands of accelerometers and allowing more control in the data&#xD;
      processing. Moreover, now there is a sleep detection algorithm that can applied to data from&#xD;
      different raw-data accelerometer brands and is freely available as a part of GGIR package in&#xD;
      R (software environment for statistical computing and graphics). The three widely used&#xD;
      raw-data accelerometer brands are the Axivity, ActiGraph and GENEActiv and ActivPAL which is&#xD;
      a thigh-worn accelerometer that provides a measure of posture using proprietary algorithmsÍ¾&#xD;
      however, raw data are now available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies that have validated the accelerometers with the PSG produced mixed results which can&#xD;
      be attributed to use of manufacturer specific sleep algorithms and different accelerometer&#xD;
      placement (dominant vs. non-dominant wrist vs. hip). Therefore validation of a sleep&#xD;
      algorithm that can be applied to different accelerometer brands against PSG warrants&#xD;
      investigation.&#xD;
