    <textblock>
      The proposed pilot study is a randomized feasibility trial of technology-enhanced brief&#xD;
      intervention for drinking reduction and antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence in 60&#xD;
      non-virally suppressed HIV participants who meet criteria for DSM-5 Alcohol Use Disorder&#xD;
      (AUD) in a Primary Care clinic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study sample will be recruited from a large urban HIV primary care clinic at Montefiore&#xD;
      Hospital where the investigators previously successfully enrolled, randomized and treated&#xD;
      study participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The interventions consist of brief meetings to discuss drinking and ART adherence enhanced&#xD;
      with daily self-monitoring through the use of a smartphone application that tracks drinking&#xD;
      and other aspects of health. These meetings will be based on the Clinician's Guide, a brief&#xD;
      intervention for heavy drinking in primary care settings advocated by the National Institute&#xD;
      on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Participants will be assessed at baseline, 30, 60, 90 days,&#xD;
      and 6 months after baseline. By the end of treatment (60 days) and throughout the follow-up&#xD;
      period, alcohol use is expected to highest among participants who receive the Clinician's&#xD;
      Guide alone, and lowest among participants who receive the Clinician's Guide plus the&#xD;
      smartphone application.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      HIV infection is a widespread health problem in the U.S. Antiretroviral (ART) therapy has&#xD;
      increased longevity and changed the nature of risk factors for morbidity and mortality.&#xD;
      Alcohol consumption has become an increasingly serious health issue among HIV primary care&#xD;
      patients. Drinking is a key factor in progression to severe liver damage (especially those&#xD;
      co-infected with hepatitis), and liver disease is now one of the most common causes of death&#xD;
      among those with HIV. Excess drinking is also associated with medication noncompliance,&#xD;
      reduces the effect of antiretroviral treatment, and is linked to other health problems.&#xD;
      Therefore, helping HIV patients reduce unsafe drinking is crucial to their long-term health.&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate an evidence-based approach, the Clinician Guide, when combined&#xD;
      with an innovative smartphone application designed to help users track drinking and ART&#xD;
      adherence and other aspects of health. An effective, easily implemented alcohol-reduction&#xD;
      intervention could be incorporated into standard care in HIV clinics to help prevent or slow&#xD;
      the progress of some medical problems in HIV-infected individuals, improve ART medication&#xD;
      compliance, prolong lifespan and decrease risk behavior associated with alcohol use.&#xD;
