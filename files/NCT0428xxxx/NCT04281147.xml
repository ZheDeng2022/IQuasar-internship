      Study to gather information about the optimal placement of Ra-223 in the order of different&#xD;
      treatments in terms of the effect on patients and in terms of the use of healthcare services&#xD;
      for the treatment of Canadian patients with prostate gland cancer which spread to other parts&#xD;
      of the body. In order to collect this information real world data from prostate gland cancer&#xD;
      patients from four Canadian administrative databases will be analyzed.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>Availability of this study's data will later be determined according to Bayer's commitment to the EFPIA/PhRMA &quot;Principles for responsible clinical trial data sharing&quot;. This pertains to scope, timepoint and process of data access. As such, Bayer commits to sharing upon request from qualified researchers patient-level clinical trial data, study-level clinical trial data, and protocols from clinical trials in patients for medicines and indications approved in the US and EU as necessary for conducting legitimate research. This applies to data on new medicines and indications that have been approved by the EU and US regulatory agencies on or after January 01, 2014. Interested researchers can use www.clinicalstudydatarequest.com to request access to anonymized patient-level data and supporting documents from clinical studies to conduct research. Information on the Bayer criteria for listing studies and other relevant information is provided in the Study sponsors section of the portal.</ipd_description>
