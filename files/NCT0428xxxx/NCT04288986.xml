  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participation in structured activities and physical activity (PA) have been linked to several&#xD;
      indicators of positive development such as self-esteem and psychological health as well as&#xD;
      greater academic outcomes and lower school drop-out rates. Despite this, 77% of boys and 80%&#xD;
      of girls aged 5-15 in the UK also fall below the national physical activity guidelines of 60&#xD;
      minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) may be at particular risk for inactivity as&#xD;
      they are more likely to experience barriers to participation in these types of activities and&#xD;
      motor skills impairments, common in people with ASC, can further limit participation in PA.&#xD;
      Studies that have attempted to increase PA in young people with autism have shown reduction&#xD;
      in problem behaviours such as inattention and aggression and increase in positive behaviours&#xD;
      such as sleep, improvements in quality of life, academic performance and physical competence,&#xD;
      and reductions in stress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary research aim is to investigate whether participation in a 8-week group based&#xD;
      activity programme affects social skills and problem behaviours in CYP with ASC.&#xD;

      Participation in structured activities and physical activity (PA) have been linked to several&#xD;
      indicators of positive development such as self-esteem and psychological health as well as&#xD;
      greater academic outcomes and lower school drop-out rates. Despite this, 77% of boys and 80%&#xD;
      of girls aged 5-15 in the UK also fall below the national physical activity guidelines of 60&#xD;
      minutes of moderate to vigorous activity per day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children with Autism Spectrum Conditions (ASC) may be at particular risk for inactivity. This&#xD;
      group are more likely to experience barriers to participation in these types of activities&#xD;
      and motor skills impairments, common in people with ASC, can further limit participation and&#xD;
      enjoyment in PA and structured activities such as sports clubs and swimming lessons. Studies&#xD;
      have shown that even at a young age children with ASC are less active than non-ASC children,&#xD;
      and this physical activity gap gets wider as children get older.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies that have attempted to increase PA in young people with autism have shown reduction&#xD;
      in problem behaviours such as inattention and aggression and increase in positive behaviours&#xD;
      such as sleep, improvements in quality of life, academic performance and physical competence,&#xD;
      and reductions in stress. However, many of these studies only worked with children 1:1 and&#xD;
      therefore little is known about group-based activity intervention in young people with ASCs&#xD;
      which could provide people with ASC opportunities to be physically active and as well as&#xD;
      opportunities to socialise with others.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parental modelling has been shown to be a predictor of children's PA behaviours with a&#xD;
      positive correlation between adult and child PA levels. Given the influential role parents&#xD;
      play on children's PA behaviours, parental involvement could be used as a function to&#xD;
      increase PA in children with ASC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is not only young people with ASC who may struggle to access or fail to participate in&#xD;
      sufficient PA but adults of the so called 'normal population'. In the UK, 34% of men and 42%&#xD;
      of women do not meet the UK physical activity guidelines of 150 minutes of moderate activity&#xD;
      per week. PA and civic participation may be particularly beneficial to parents of children&#xD;
      with ASC as parents of children with developmental disorders have been shown to report lower&#xD;
      quality of life, more depression, higher levels of stress anxiety, and greater pessimism&#xD;
      about the future than parents of typically developing children. As a result, parents with&#xD;
      children who have ASC may experience lower sense of connectedness to the social world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate whether participation in an 8-week group based activity programme affects&#xD;
      social skills and problem behaviours in children and young people (CYP) with ASC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary aims&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effects of a weekly group based activity programme on parental wellbeing&#xD;
      and social connectedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate the effects of a weekly group based activity programme on CYP self-image.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate parental goals for participating in a group based activity programme and&#xD;
      evaluate progress toward these goals at the end of the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To investigate session enjoyment levels from activities in the 8-week programme via a&#xD;
      feedback form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypotheses&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a difference in social skills and problem behaviours scores for CYP pre and&#xD;
      post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a difference in parental wellbeing and social connectedness scores for parents&#xD;
      pre and post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a difference in self-image scores for CYP pre and post intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Method&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample will consist of 20 CYP with an ASC and 20 parents/carers of CYP with an ASC. All&#xD;
      participants will take place in an 8-week group based activity programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Principle inclusion criteria include; children with a working or full ASC diagnosis aged&#xD;
      between 5-15 years, self-declared physically fit to participate in activities. Siblings and&#xD;
      additional adults will also be invited to participate in the programme in order to support&#xD;
      their sibling with ASC and to make attendance easier for parents who would otherwise struggle&#xD;
      with childcare if they were not able to participate in the programme as a family. However,&#xD;
      data will not be collected from this group. Participants will be recruited through&#xD;
      advertisements on social media and at local autism support groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will use a pretest-posttest quasi experimental design. Participants will complete a&#xD;
      serious of questionnaires prior to participating in an 8 week activity programme and again&#xD;
      after completing the programme.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 8-week group based activity programme will consist of 8 sessions each lasting 50 minutes.&#xD;
      The sessions in the programme will be different each week. A number of sessions will be&#xD;
      semi-structured free play sessions which will be supervised by qualified staff from Midlands&#xD;
      Psychology CIC; 2 assistant psychologists and a project manager. All staff will have enhanced&#xD;
      DBS checks and over a years' experience running these kinds of activity sessions with&#xD;
      families. Risk assessments will be completed prior to each session.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Semi-structured free play sessions will be consist of a range of activities which parents and&#xD;
      CYP can participate in together (frisbee, hockey, soft play, football, obstacle courses, glow&#xD;
      in the dark activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several sessions will be hosted by local sports clubs such as football, rugby and handball.&#xD;
      When sports clubs host session they will be instructed to break their sport down into a&#xD;
      series fun 'drills' for families to participate in such as passing skills, dribbling,&#xD;
      shooting, ending with a small game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There will be a swimming session taking place in the swimming pool of a local leisure centre.&#xD;
      For this session parents and CYP will be supervised in the swimming pool by trained&#xD;
      lifeguards and staff members from Midlands Psychology CIC will not be in the swimming pool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The final session in the programme will be a novel activity such as a climbing session at a&#xD;
      'clip and climb' centre to celebrate participation in the programme. This session will be run&#xD;
      by the centres' own staff, who have experience running these sessions and require families to&#xD;
      participate in a safety briefing and demonstration prior to climbing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants can choose to participate in a group based activity programme running in either&#xD;
      Stafford, Burton, Cannock or Tamworth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited via online advertisements. These advertisements will target&#xD;
      families living within the Staffordshire area. The advertisements will inform prospective&#xD;
      participants of the 8-week group based programme and ask all interested to contact the&#xD;
      research team for further information.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be sent (via email or post if requested) a parent and child information&#xD;
      sheet detailing what the study entails and the consent and assent forms to be completed for&#xD;
      all those taking part in the research. Participants will be informed that they can drop out&#xD;
      of the study at any time and ask for their data to be withdrawn. Participants will also have&#xD;
      the opportunity to contact the researchers and have any queries addressed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prior to the start of the activity programme, all participants will have the oppourtunity to&#xD;
      complete the following measures with the researchers or have them sent in the post; the&#xD;
      Social Skills Improvement System -Parent (SSIS), Social Skills Improvement System -Student&#xD;
      (SSIS), Social Connectedness Scale - Revised (SCS-R), Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental&#xD;
      Wellbeing Scale (SWEMWBS), the Self Image Profile (SIP) and goal based outcomes (GBO). If&#xD;
      participants have these sent via post, they will be asked to return all of these prior to the&#xD;
      start of the 8-week activity programme. Once the 8-week activity programme has ended,&#xD;
      participants will again be asked to complete the SSIS, SCS-R, SWEMWBS, SIP and GBOs.&#xD;
      Participants will be thanked for their participation in the research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children under the age of 8 years, only their parents' data will be collected as the&#xD;
      questionnaires require a minimum age of 8.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Measures&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Skills Improvement System Rating Scales. For both adults and CYP (CYP over the age of&#xD;
      8)&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Social Skills Improvement System (SSIS) evaluates social skills and problem behaviours.&#xD;
      There are two separate questionnaires: one for parents/guardians and one for CYP.&#xD;
      Parents/guardians report on the frequency their children exhibit social skills and problem&#xD;
      behaviours on a 4-point scale: never, seldom, often, and almost always.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Connectedness Scale Revised&#xD;
&#xD;
      For adults only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social Connectedness is considered is an attribute of the self, reflecting interpersonal&#xD;
      thoughts and closeness to the social world. The scale is comprised of 10 negatively worked&#xD;
      and 10 positively worded items such as &quot;I feel comfortable in the presence of strangers&quot; and&#xD;
      &quot;I feel myself as an outsider&quot;. Participants rate the degree to which they agree or disagree&#xD;
      on a scale from 1-6 (1= strongly disagree, 6 strongly agree).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Short Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scales (SWEMWBS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For adults only&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Short version of the Warwick-Edinburgh Mental Wellbeing Scales measures positive aspects&#xD;
      of mental health in the prior 2 weeks such as &quot;i've been feeling useful&quot; or &quot;i've been&#xD;
      feeling relaxed&quot;. The scale comprises 7 positively phrased items responded on a 5-point&#xD;
      Likert-type scale from 'None of the time' to 'All of the time'.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Self Image Profile&#xD;
&#xD;
      For children only&#xD;
&#xD;
      This SIP invites respondents to give two ratings of how they consider themselves to be; and&#xD;
      how they would like to be across 25 items. Participants rate each item from 0 (Not At All) to&#xD;
      6 (Very Much). The SIP comprises 12 items of a positive nature i.e. 'Intelligent' and 12 of a&#xD;
      negative tone 'mess about'. Once completed a self image score (summation of the first rating)&#xD;
      and self esteem score (operationally defined as the discrepancy between the two ratings) can&#xD;
      be obtained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Goal Based Outcomes (GBOs)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For adults only&#xD;
&#xD;
      Parents will be asked to state 3 goals that they wish to achieve from participating in the&#xD;
      8-week programme. Prior to the start of the intervention, parents will be asked to rate where&#xD;
      they feel they are now in relation to achieving a specified goal on a scale of 0-10, 0 being&#xD;
      'goal not at all met' and 10 being 'goal reached'. At the end of the intervention, parents&#xD;
      will be asked to again rate where they feel they are now in relation to achieving a specified&#xD;
      goal on the same rating scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Proposed data analysis SSIS (Social Skills and Problem Behaviours) A paired-samples t-test&#xD;
      will be used to compare the pre-test and post-test scores for social skills and problem&#xD;
      behaviours on the parental SSIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paired-samples t-test will be used to compare the pre-test and post-test scores for social&#xD;
      skills and problem behaviours on the student SSIS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SIP (Self-image)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paired-samples t-test will be used to compare the pre-test and post-test scores for&#xD;
      self-image for children with ASC.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SWEMWBS (Wellbeing)&#xD;
&#xD;
      A paired-samples t-test will be used to compare the pre-test and post-test scores for&#xD;
      parental mental wellbeing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCS-R (Social Connectedness) A paired-samples t-test will be used to compare the pre-test and&#xD;
      post-test scores for parents' feelings of social connectedness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBO's (Goal Based Outcomes) The GBO ratings from pre and post-intervention for the&#xD;
      experimental group will be compared to investigate to what extent parents felt their goals&#xD;
      for participation were reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enjoyment The enjoyment ratings will be correlated with session attendance figures to see&#xD;
      whether attendance in the 8-week programme was associated with enjoyment of the sessions.&#xD;
