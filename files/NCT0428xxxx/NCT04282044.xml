  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This clinical study is an open-label, phase 1, dose-escalation study to determine the safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, and pharmacokinetic (PK) properties of CRX100 in adult subjects with advanced&#xD;
      solid tumors. Patients will be screened and evaluated to determine whether or not they meet&#xD;
      stated inclusion criteria. Enrolled subjects will undergo leukapheresis to enable the ex vivo&#xD;
      generation of autologous cytokine induced killer (CIK) cells. Patients with triple-negative&#xD;
      breast cancer, colorectal cancer, hepatocellular carcinoma, osteosarcoma, epithelial ovarian&#xD;
      cancer, and gastric cancer will be considered.&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Subjects who meet any of the following criteria will be excluded from participation in this&#xD;
        study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Subjects with new or progressive brain metastasis. Subjects with treated brain&#xD;
             metastases are eligible if there is no evidence of progression for at least 4 weeks&#xD;
             after central nervous system-directed treatment, as ascertained by clinical&#xD;
             examination and brain imaging (MRI or CT) during the screening period.&#xD;

             for vitiligo, type I diabetes mellitus, residual hypothyroidism due to autoimmune&#xD;
             condition requiring only hormone replacement, psoriasis not requiring systemic&#xD;
             treatment, or conditions not expected to recur in the absence of an external trigger.&#xD;

             daily prednisone or equivalent) or other immunosuppressive medications within 14 days&#xD;
             prior to apheresis, and within 14 days prior to infusion. Inhaled or topical steroids&#xD;
             and adrenal replacement doses (≤10 mg daily prednisone equivalents) are permitted in&#xD;
             the absence of active autoimmune disease. Short-term (&lt;48 hr) steroid pretreatment for&#xD;
             contrast allergy for imaging is permitted.&#xD;

             life-threatening illnesses unrelated to cancer, or any serious medical or psychiatric&#xD;
             illness that could, in the Investigator's opinion, interfere with participation in&#xD;
             this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Pregnant or nursing an infant (subject or household contacts).&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Clinically significant immunodeficiency (e.g., due to underlying illness and/or&#xD;
             medication) in a subject or household contacts.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Have any underlying medical condition (including, but not limited to, ongoing or&#xD;
             active infection requiring treatment, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable&#xD;
             angina pectoris, or cardiac arrhythmia), psychiatric condition, or social situation&#xD;
             that, in the opinion of the Investigator, would compromise study administration as per&#xD;
             protocol or compromise the assessment of AEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Have a history of another invasive malignancy, except for the following circumstance:&#xD;
             individuals with a history of invasive malignancy are eligible if they have been&#xD;
             disease free and off treatment for at least 2 years or are deemed by the Investigator&#xD;
             to be at low risk for recurrence of that malignancy; individuals with the following&#xD;
             cancers are eligible if diagnosed and treated: carcinoma in situ of the breast, oral&#xD;
             cavity, or cervix, localized prostate cancer, or basal cell or squamous cell carcinoma&#xD;
             of the skin. When enrolling a subject with another malignancy, the Investigator should&#xD;
             consider discussing the subject with the Medical Monitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Treatment with any investigational drug study, oncolytic viral therapy or&#xD;
             immunotherapy within three (3) weeks of enrollment.&#xD;
&#xD;
