  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary aims of the study are to assess the user experience and initial efficacy of a&#xD;
      mobile application designed to reduce problematic alcohol use. The application utilizes&#xD;
      drinking limits, defined by the user, to pace alcohol consumption during drinking occasions.&#xD;
      The mobile application will be compared to strategies for tracking drinking detailed within&#xD;
      the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Alcohol Moderation Strategies&#xD;
      (https://www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/thinking-about-a-change/strategies-for-cutting-&#xD;
      down/tips-to-try.aspx). Primary outcome variables, in addition to variables assessing user&#xD;
      design experience of the application and use of moderation strategies, include (1) negative&#xD;
      consequences of alcohol use during a 14 day observation period, and (2) number of drinks&#xD;
      consumed per drinking day during a 14 day observation period.&#xD;

      The mobile application to be tested provides guidance on moderating alcohol use in real time&#xD;
      based on individual user's pre-defined drinking limits. This mobile application will be&#xD;
      compared to a drink tracking strategy and corresponding tool outlined within the National&#xD;
      Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism Alcohol Moderation Strategies&#xD;
      (https://www.rethinkingdrinking.niaaa.nih.gov/thinking-about-a-change/strategies-for-cutting-&#xD;
      down/tips-to-try.aspx).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from the community in Northeastern Ohio. Eligible participants&#xD;
      will meet the following inclusion criteria 1) be age 21 or older, 2) report experiencing at&#xD;
      least three negative consequence of alcohol use in the past month (assessed via Brief Young&#xD;
      Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire: BYAACQ), 3) report having consumed at least 5&#xD;
      drinks (for men) or 4 drinks (for women) on one or more occasions in the past 2-weeks, 4) not&#xD;
      be seeking treatment for alcohol use from a health-care provider, and 5) have access to a&#xD;
      smartphone and 6) endorse some importance in changing their drinking (2 or greater on Alcohol&#xD;
      Ladder Scale Importance to Change). Participants who endorse seeking treatment for alcohol&#xD;
      related problems from a health care provider will be provided with a list of university&#xD;
      sponsored and community based treatment providers, and excluded. Participants (n=64) will&#xD;
      complete a battery of assessments including demographic measures, alcohol and substance use&#xD;
      measures, psychological measures, behavioral economic and neuropsychological measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Timeline Follow-back Interview will be used to assess alcohol use. The Brief Young Adult&#xD;
      Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (BYAACQ ) will be used to assess a range of negative&#xD;
      consequences of alcohol use that young adults may experience (e.g., while drinking in the&#xD;
      past month, I have said or done embarrassing things).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following this initial baseline assessment, participants will be randomized to one of two&#xD;
      experimental conditions detailed below (Alcohol Moderation Group 1 and 2). Doctoral&#xD;
      Candidates in Clinical Psychology will review strategies for moderating alcohol use with all&#xD;
      participants (strategies recommended by the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and&#xD;
      Alcoholism; detail included as supplement). The only variation in the discussion of&#xD;
      strategies is the the Alcohol Moderation Group 1 will receive detail and training on how to&#xD;
      use the mobile application; whereas, the Alcohol Moderation Group 2 will receive detail and&#xD;
      training on how to use the drinking tracker card recommended within the NIAAA guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary outcome variables, in addition to variables assessing user design experience of the&#xD;
      application and use of moderation strategies, will include (1) negative consequences of&#xD;
      alcohol use during a 14 day observation period following randomization, and (2) number of&#xD;
      drinks consumed per drinking day during a 14 day observation period following randomization.&#xD;
      Assessment of primary outcome variable (1) will include baseline negative consequences of&#xD;
      alcohol use (BYAACQ score) during the 14 day period prior to randomization as a covariate as&#xD;
      well as additional covariates defined a priori based on the extant literature. Assessment of&#xD;
      primary outcome variable (2) will include consideration of average drinking limit for each&#xD;
      drinking day defined by the user, and number of drinks per drinking day in a 14 day period&#xD;
      prior to randomization, as well as covariates defined a priori based on the extant&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;

    <description>The Brief Young Adult Alcohol Consequences Questionnaire (BYAACQ) will be used to assess negative consequences of alcohol use (24-items). Minimum score is 0, maximum is 24, with higher scores indicating more negative consequences of alcohol use. Change in this score will be assessed via inclusion of baseline measures of the BYAACQ in final statistical models.</description>

    <description>A daily alcohol use diary will be provided for the two-week observation period. Participants will be trained on how to use the diary during the baseline laboratory session. Number of standard drinks per drinking day will be calculated from the daily diary alcohol consumption records (total number of standard drinks consumed / number of drinking days). Change in drinks per drinking day will be assessed via inclusion of baseline measures of the drinks consumed per drinking day (assessed via Timeline follow back) in final statistical models.</description>
