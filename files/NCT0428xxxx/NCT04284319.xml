      Normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) utilizes Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) or&#xD;
      cardiopulmonary bypass to reperfuse the heart and other organs in situ after isolation and&#xD;
      ligation of the cerebral vessels. In situ resuscitation of the heart has the added advantage&#xD;
      of allowing full hemodynamic and echocardiographic assessment of the donor heart prior to&#xD;
      final acceptance for transplantation without the imminent danger of ongoing warm ischemia.&#xD;

      The current procedure of DCD organ donation and procurement follows a well-established course&#xD;
      for lung, liver, kidney and pancreas transplantation in the United States. After consent has&#xD;
      been obtained, the organs are allocated through UNOS. When all parties are present and ready,&#xD;
      the donor is withdrawn from life support (i.e., discontinuation of mechanical ventilation and&#xD;
      any vasoactive medications). The surgical teams are generally present on the premises but not&#xD;
      at the donor's bedside. After circulatory arrest occurs, which is determined by the absence&#xD;
      of pulse and organized rhythmic cardiac activity, death is declared by a physician not&#xD;
      associated with the transplant teams. Subsequently a period of stand-off is observed (5&#xD;
      minutes for organs donated in New York) to ensure complete cessation of the circulation&#xD;
      before organ procurement is commenced. If after withdrawal of life support the patient does&#xD;
      not progress to circulatory death within the allotted time (variable among hospitals, but 180&#xD;
      minutes in this study), the procurement is abandoned and the patient is transferred out of&#xD;
      the operating room and placed on palliative measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that DCD organ donation is already currently practiced in the US, the same standard&#xD;
      approach defined by each state and locality can also be applied to DCD heart donation and&#xD;
      will be followed for this protocol at NYULH. However, this protocol will utilize a&#xD;
      normothermic regional perfusion (NRP) strategy that involves reestablishment of circulatory&#xD;
      blood flow after the period of circulatory arrest has been established and the 5 minutes of&#xD;
      standoff time has passed. The local Organ Procurement Organization (LiveOnNY) and NYULH&#xD;
      Medical Leadership have reviewed and approved this approach to DCD heart donation.&#xD;
      Specifically, normothermic regional perfusion involves the following steps:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Opening the chest through a standard sternotomy used for heart and lung procurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Ligation of the all the blood vessels that supply blood to the brain to ensure that&#xD;
           blood flow to the brain is not reestablished once circulation is restarted as described&#xD;
           below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Standard cannulation of the aorta and the right atrium as is done for cardiac surgical&#xD;
           procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass, which will re-establish the flow of blood to all&#xD;
           organs of the body including the heart under normothermia. The initial step for ligation&#xD;
           of the blood vessels to the head is necessary to ensure that blood flow to the brain&#xD;
           does not occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once blood flow to the heart is established, the heart will start beating. At 30 minute&#xD;
      intervals, the donor will be separated from cardiopulmonary bypass and the heart will be&#xD;
      assessed for functionality. If accepted standard DBD procurement will commence. The heart&#xD;
      transplantation surgery on the potential recipient will only begin once the heart has been&#xD;
      accepted as suitable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If after assessment the heart is not suitable, cardiopulmonary bypass will be restarted. The&#xD;
      donor heart will be reassessed at 30 minute intervals up to 180 minutes. If no significant&#xD;
      acceptable recovery occurs and the heart is not deemed suitable for transplantation, then the&#xD;
      study will be terminated, but the remaining organs can be recovered as standard practice.&#xD;
