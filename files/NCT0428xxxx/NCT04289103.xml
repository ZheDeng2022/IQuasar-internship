             progression after 3 days of treatment with corticosteroids at 2 mg/Kg&#xD;
             methylprednisolone equivalent dose)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Age 28 days to &lt; 18 years old&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Allo-HSCT with any type of donor, stem cell source, GVHD prophylaxis or conditioning&#xD;
             regimen&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients receiving Allo-HSCT for any indication (i.e. malignant or non-malignant&#xD;
             disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signature of informed and written consent by the patient and/or by the patient's&#xD;
