  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that&#xD;
      can impact all aspects of nervous system function. Currently clinical assessments as part of&#xD;
      the standard of care are performed in the health care providers office during regularly&#xD;
      scheduled visits and are semi-quantitative or qualitative in nature. The goal of the BeCare&#xD;
      Multiple Sclerosis Assessment App is to allow for patient centered, frequent, and&#xD;
      quantitative assessments of neurologic function through a mobile App. The BeCare MS App&#xD;
      integrates with all Android and Apple operating systems. The investigator's overall goal is&#xD;
      to improve well-being of people with MS through accurate assessment of their neurologic&#xD;
      function to be used by themselves as well as their health care providers. The purpose of this&#xD;
      Clinical Trial is to validate the App based assessments versus Gold-Standard clinical&#xD;
      assessments.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients will complete the 11 App based and clinically based assessments in one visit. These&#xD;
      will be repeated 3-7 times to eliminate learning variation. The assessments and the&#xD;
      instructions to complete these assessments are on the App and listed below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Timed Up and Go (TUG). The primary endpoint of this study is to compare the App-based&#xD;
           TUG with the clinically derived TUG results. The hypothesis is that the App based result&#xD;
           and the clinically derived result are equivalent. The TUG is a validated assessment of&#xD;
           functional mobility (2). For the TUG, the Subject is seated in a regular chair with no&#xD;
           chair arm-rests. At the start of the test designated by a vocal cue, the Subject will&#xD;
           stand walk to a mark three meters from where there feet are placed when sitting, turn&#xD;
           180 degrees, walk back to the chair and sit to finish. The test result is recorded as&#xD;
           the time from start to finish. Normative data have been established for the TUG and the&#xD;
           test has been validated in MS (2). For the App-based assessment the Subject will hold&#xD;
           their mobile devise in their hand, they will select on the test and then perform the&#xD;
           test without external cue. For the traditional TUG, the subject will be instructed to&#xD;
           start by a research coordinator who will also start a timer. The research coordinator&#xD;
           will stop the timer when the Subject has seated. During the traditional TUG test the&#xD;
           Subject will also be holding their mobile phone in their hand as they had done for the&#xD;
           App-based test. Three comparisons will be made: App-based result when the Subject&#xD;
           self-initiates versus the traditional result; App-based result when the patient self&#xD;
           initiates versus the App-based result when the patient is instructed to start; ands&#xD;
           App-based result when the patient is instructed to start versus the traditional result.&#xD;
           A students t-test or a Welch's t-test will be performed with a Bonferroni correction&#xD;
           when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Fine motor function/rapid finger movements (FMF) is a secondary endpoints. FMF is&#xD;
           assessed by having the patient tap the interphalangeal crease of their thumb with the&#xD;
           ipsilateral index finger tip. This movement is typically impacted with upper motor&#xD;
           neuron dysfunction, cerebellar dysfunction, and possibly with severe loss of position&#xD;
           sense and is a sensitive indicator of dysfunction. However, this test is never&#xD;
           quantitatively reported in the neurologic exam. For the traditional test, patients will&#xD;
           be asked to tap their finger on their thumb crease as rapidly as possible for 10&#xD;
           seconds. The test will be reported as normal, slowed, or severely impaired. The normal&#xD;
           variation between dominant and non-dominant hands will be noted. For the App based test&#xD;
           the Subject will be presented with a game on their mobile phone that requires them to&#xD;
           tap a designated spot as frequently as possible for 10 seconds. The phone will record&#xD;
           the number of taps, the regularity of their spacing and any consistent change over time&#xD;
           (fatigue). The test will be repeated 3 times and results presented as the mean +/- SD&#xD;
           for each measurement. The change in frequency over time will be reported. A students&#xD;
           t-test or a Welch's t-test will be performed with a Bonferroni correction when&#xD;
           indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Upper extremity coordination (secondary endpoint). Upper extremity cerebellar function&#xD;
           is typically measured doing a finger-nose-finger test where the subject touches the&#xD;
           examiners finger, then their own nose, then the examiners finger again. Typically, the&#xD;
           movement is repeated several times. In the clinical setting, the test is commonly&#xD;
           reported as normal, impaired (mild dysmetria) or severely impaired (marked dysmetria).&#xD;
           For the App based test, the Subject will be asked to move an object with their index&#xD;
           finger such that it stays within the boundaries of a moving path. The App will measure&#xD;
           deviations outside the path as well as circumstances in which these deviations occur.&#xD;
           The test will be repeated 3 times on each side and results presented as the mean for&#xD;
           each deviation greater than 2 standard deviations in difference from the control&#xD;
           population. The change in frequency over time will be reported as the XXXX. A students&#xD;
           t-test or a Welch's t-test will be performed with a Bonferroni correction when&#xD;
           indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Auditory-Comprehension-Typing (ACT) test (secondary endpoint). In this test the subject&#xD;
           is given a short auditory phrase and then must type that phrase using a virtual&#xD;
           keyboard. The time to complete typing the phrase as well as the time interval and time&#xD;
           variance between keystrokes is compiled and compared to healthy age-matched controls. To&#xD;
           control for fine motor function the virtual keyboard records the time and variance for&#xD;
           tapping a series of keys that spontaneously change color (white background to green for&#xD;
           example), which is termed the maximal keystroke velocity (strokes/second). [should the&#xD;
           maximal keystroke velocity be subtracted or used as a denominator?] Comparisons are made&#xD;
           between Subjects and Healthy controls for the absolute time to type the phrase, and for&#xD;
           the key-stroke variance. Harmonic and conjugate harmonic functions will be determined by&#xD;
           the Milne - Thompson method and expressed in a two-dimensional surface.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Timed 25-foot walk (secondary endpoint). At the start of the test the subject is&#xD;
           standing at a mark (typically taped on the floor) and is prepared to walk to the&#xD;
           destination mark 25 feet away. Timing begins with a vocal cue and the Subject walks as&#xD;
           quickly as possible while remaining safe, to the 25 foot mark. The test result is&#xD;
           recorded as the time from start to finish. Normative data have been established for the&#xD;
           Timed 25 foot walk and the test has been validated in MS (3). For the App-based&#xD;
           assessment the Subject will hold their mobile devise in their hand, they will select the&#xD;
           test and then perform the test without external cue. For the traditional Timed 25 foot&#xD;
           walk, the subject will be instructed to start by a research coordinator who will also&#xD;
           start a timer. The research coordinator will stop the timer when the Subject has reached&#xD;
           the 25-foot mark. Three comparisons will be made: App-based result when the Subject&#xD;
           self-initiates versus the traditional result; App-based result when the patient self&#xD;
           initiates versus the App-based result when the patient is instructed to start; and the&#xD;
           App-based result when the patient is instructed to start versus the traditional result.&#xD;
           A students t-test or a Welch's t-test will be performed with a Bonferroni correction&#xD;
           when indicated.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Coded Message Cognitive Test (secondary endpoint). For this test the subject is asked to&#xD;
           decode a message using decoding key. A series of symbols are paired with letters or&#xD;
           words to be used as the key. The coded message is provided in symbols. The Subject self&#xD;
           starts the test by pressing a &quot;begin button&quot; and the test stops when the Subject&#xD;
           completes the decoded message. For the standard test, subjects will perform the symbol&#xD;
           digit modality test. Normative data for the Coded Message Cognitive test will be&#xD;
           generated. Comparisons will be maded between MS Subjects and the normative data for the&#xD;
           Coded Message Test, as well as between the Coded Message Test and the Symbol Digit&#xD;
           Modality test.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Six minute walk (secondary endpoint). For this test we will measure the distance covered&#xD;
           by the Subject while walking at a comfortable and safe pace for 6 minutes. The App will&#xD;
           record distance using GPS and will record the number of steps taken using the mobile&#xD;
           devises accelerometer. This test will be performed once with the observation of a&#xD;
           research coordinator and then three additional times within three days time by the&#xD;
           subject. Mean times and mean step numbers will be determined and compared to normative&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Contrast Sensitivity (secondary endpoint). For this test the subject is asked to discern&#xD;
           or read letters/numerals off a screen with varying contrast sensitivity (grey on grey).&#xD;
           Next to each letter/number is a box for them to enter the character/numeral using a&#xD;
           virtual keyboard. The number of correct assignments are recorded and reported as a&#xD;
           fraction of the total number tested. For the standard test, subjects are asked to report&#xD;
           the numbers or letters of a standard Snellen chart as well as low contrast Snellen&#xD;
           charts (2.5, 1.25). Comparisons will be made between the subject and the normative data&#xD;
           for each test. Comparisons will also be made between normalized values for each test for&#xD;
           each Subject. A third test will be performed in which the subject &quot;rolls&quot; a ball through&#xD;
           a maze of ever decreasing contrast sensitivity. The size of the maze path will be&#xD;
           adjusted based on their cerebellar and fine motor function determined above. The time to&#xD;
           first error and the time to repeated errors is determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Arm Swing Test (secondary endpoint). For this test the subject is asked to hold their&#xD;
           mobile device in their dominant hand and then raise their arms to pass the devise to&#xD;
           their other hand over the top of their head. This is repeated as fast as possible for 30&#xD;
           seconds. For the standard test, upper extremity strength is recorded on the neurologic 5&#xD;
           point scale (5 = normal, 4 = active resistance, 3 = antigravity, 2 = movement in the&#xD;
           absence of gravity, 1 = movement of a muscle but no movement of the limb, 0 = no&#xD;
           movement at all. Comparisons will be made between each subject and normative data, and&#xD;
           between the two test groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. Birds in a box working memory test (secondary). For this test the subject is presented&#xD;
           with 5 boxes in a row, each with a different colored bird in them and told to memorize&#xD;
           the bird color for each box. After 8 seconds, the boxes are closed and above one box&#xD;
           five bird color choices will appear at which time the subject must place a new bird in&#xD;
           that box without violating the rule that the original 5 boxes in a row can not have more&#xD;
           than two birds of the same color at any one time. The appearance of birds to drop into&#xD;
           the box will be mathematically determined to pose the same risk/difficulty for each&#xD;
           subject. The number of errors are recorded and the number of correct choices are&#xD;
           recorded over 90 seconds. For the standard test, subjects will perform the Paced Serial&#xD;
           Addition Test (PASAT). PASAT and Birds in a box results will be normalized and compared&#xD;
           for each subject. If the subject has difficulty with fine motor function, a&#xD;
           normalization factor will be provided to increase the time to complete the task.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Balance Test (secondary). The subject is asked to stand with feet together and then&#xD;
           raise their non-dominant leg such that their knee is at waist level. The time is&#xD;
           recorded until the patient looses balance and touches the ground with the raised foot.&#xD;
           The test is repeated for a total of three times for each side alternating for side to&#xD;
           side. Test results are compared to healthy controls to achieve normative data.&#xD;
