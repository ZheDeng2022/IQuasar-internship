  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This proof-of-principle study aims to investigate the effects of a brief behavioural&#xD;
      procedure including a computerized visuospatial task (the computer game &quot;Tetris&quot;) preceded by&#xD;
      a reactivation of the traumatic memory of childbirth, on birth-related intrusive traumatic&#xD;
      memories and other postpartum posttraumatic stress symptoms. Women who report birth-related&#xD;
      intrusive memories after 6 weeks postpartum will monitor their intrusive traumatic memories&#xD;
      in a daily diary. After two weeks of diary, they will meet a psychologist to briefly evoke&#xD;
      the memory of their birth, and receive a brief behavioural procedure including playing&#xD;
      Tetris. Participants will then continue to complete an intrusive traumatic memory diary&#xD;
      during two weeks. It is predicted that they will report fewer intrusive memories in the two&#xD;
      weeks following the intervention, compared to the two weeks before. This will inform the&#xD;
      potential future development of a simple computerized intervention procedure to reduce&#xD;
      distressing psychological symptoms after traumatic childbirth.&#xD;
