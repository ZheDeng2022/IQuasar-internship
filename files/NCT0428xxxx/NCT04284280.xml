      The aim of the project is to study the effects of fortification (using a Human Milk Donor&#xD;
      Fortifier) of an exclusive preterm human milk diet on outcome of extremely preterm neonates,&#xD;
      born at less or equal to 27 weeks.&#xD;

      II. BACKGROUND Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is a serious gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
      affecting &gt;10% of extremely preterm infants with a mortality of up to 50%. The&#xD;
      pathophysiology is poorly understood, but intestinal immaturity, microbial colonization,&#xD;
      hypoxic ischemia, and diet have all been implicated. Use of human milk and standardized&#xD;
      feedings are the only strategies that consistently have been shown to decrease the incidence&#xD;
      of disease. Our NICU has been using a standardized feeding protocol with an emphasis on human&#xD;
      milk for over 20 years. In 1995, Crouse became a NY state licensed human milk bank, which&#xD;
      accepts donors that have delivered preterm. Preterm breast milk has distinct nutritional&#xD;
      advantages over milk obtained from donors who delivered term infants. In particular, there is&#xD;
      a higher protein and mineral concentration in preterm human milk compared to mature term milk&#xD;
      which is what is typically available in all commercial milk banks. All extremely preterm&#xD;
      infants in our NICU receive preterm human milk - maternal or donor. Combined with following&#xD;
      our standard feeding protocol, this has resulted in &gt;90% less NEC than in comparable NICUs.&#xD;
      The investigators reported an incidence of NEC of 1% over a recent 6 year period, compared to&#xD;
      an incidence of 12% among the three other upstate NY regional perinatal programs (Albany,&#xD;
      Rochester and Buffalo).&#xD;
&#xD;
      While the prevention of feeding related morbidities such as NEC is paramount, growth remains&#xD;
      a concern in these extremely preterm infants. Growth velocity has been shown to have a&#xD;
      significant effect on neurodevelopmental outcomes in at least one study. Human milk&#xD;
      fortifiers are marketed and used to various degrees in an effort to increase weight gain in&#xD;
      VLBW infants fed maternal breast milk (MBM). Our current feeding protocol calls for&#xD;
      &quot;selective&quot; human milk fortification with a human milk derived fortifier (HMDF; Prolact+4&#xD;
      H2MF, Prolacta Bioscience, Morovia, CA). Our criterion for fortification is sustained weight&#xD;
      gain &lt;15 g/kg/day. Most other centers use fortification more routinely. The impact of&#xD;
      fortification on feeding related morbidities (e.g. NEC) as well as growth and longer term&#xD;
      outcomes are unknown. For example, one recent randomized trial included infants at high risk&#xD;
      for NEC (birth weight &lt;1250 g). All of the infants in that study were fed their own mother's&#xD;
      milk but differed by the type of supplementation used. Some infants received HMDF (Prolacta)&#xD;
      and donor human milk if maternal milk became unavailable (exclusive human milk diet), whereas&#xD;
      others received a bovine milk-based fortifier with maternal milk and preterm formula if no&#xD;
      maternal milk was available (bovine group). In the exclusive human milk group, some infants&#xD;
      were assigned randomly to receive fortification early (when milk intake was only 40&#xD;
      mL/kg/day) and some later (when milk intake was 100 mL/kg/day). While the incidence of NEC&#xD;
      was reduced from 26% for infants in the bovine group to 7% for those in the exclusive human&#xD;
      milk group , the incidence was still seven-fold higher than that reported by us. Also of&#xD;
      note, the group who received the earlier fortification had a higher incidence of NEC than the&#xD;
      group that received later fortification (8% vs 6%). It is unclear what role early&#xD;
      fortification plays in the pathogenesis of NEC, but theoretical concerns include effects on&#xD;
      host-defense properties and milk osmolality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In summary:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Exclusive use of human milk is associated with a lower rate of NEC.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Preterm human milk (maternal or preterm donor) has distinct advantages over commercial&#xD;
           donor human milk that comes from mothers of mature term infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Fostering more rapid growth seems advantageous, but the role of fortification in the&#xD;
           development of NEC and other morbidities is unclear as are the long term benefits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the purpose of our study is to compare an exclusive preterm human milk diet using&#xD;
      routine early fortification with a diet that uses fortification selectively for poor growth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To compare the effectiveness of early routine human milk nutritional fortification vs.&#xD;
           selective fortification on in-hospital growth in extremely preterm infants.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To compare the incidence of feeding intolerance and NEC in extremely preterm infants&#xD;
           receiving early routine fortification vs. those receiving selective fortification for&#xD;
           poor weight gain.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To compare the effect of early routine human milk nutritional fortification vs.&#xD;
           selective fortification on growth after discharge from the NICU up to 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To compare the effect of early routine human milk nutritional fortification vs.&#xD;
           selective fortification on neurodevelopmental outcomes at 2 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized controlled trial in extremely preterm infants, which will be conducted&#xD;
      at the Crouse Hospital NICU in Syracuse, NY. Parents of eligible infants will be approached&#xD;
      by study investigators for informed consent prior to the initiation of enteral feeds.&#xD;
      Enrolled infants will then be randomized by milk bank personnel into two groups:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Early routine fortification (RF): HMDF added to preterm human milk (maternal or donor)&#xD;
           when feeds of 150 mL/kg/day are reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Selective fortification (SF): HMDF added to preterm human milk only for weight gain &lt;15&#xD;
           g/kg/d after full feeds of 180 mL/kg/day are achieved.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full feeds (120Kcal/kg/day) is achieved with unfortified milk at a volume of 180 ml/kg/day&#xD;
      and with fortified human milk at a volume of 150ml/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enteral feedings will be prepared by the bedside nurse. The primary outcome will be growth&#xD;
      velocity (g/kg/day) after regaining birth weight. Our prior study of ELBW infants in the&#xD;
      Crouse NICU, showed a mean growth velocity of 13 ± 2.5 g/kg/day. Two-hundred study subjects&#xD;
      would adequately power the study to show a 1 g/kg/day difference between study groups&#xD;
      (α=0.05, β=0.2). Based on previous admission rates to our NICU, this enrollment could be&#xD;
      achieved in 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes will include NEC, time to full feeds (surrogate for feeding intolerance),&#xD;
      other growth parameters (length and head circumference), and neurodevelopmental outcomes at&#xD;
      24 months of age, adjusted for prematurity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. SUBJECT SELECTION Inclusion Criteria: This study will include all extremely preterm&#xD;
      infants with gestational age at less or equal to 27 weeks who are admitted to the NICU prior&#xD;
      to day of life seven and the first enteral feeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion Criteria: Infants with severe congenital anomalies such as chromosomal trisomy,&#xD;
      congenital heart disease, abdominal wall defect will be excluded, and severe Intra&#xD;
      Ventricular Hemorrhage prior to entering the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. STATISTICAL METHODS, DATA ANALYSIS, AND INTERPRETATION Parametric data will be analyzed&#xD;
      using the student t-test and presented with means and standard deviations. Non-parametric&#xD;
      data will be analyzed using the Mann-Whitney U-test and presented with medians and&#xD;
      interquartile ranges (IQR). Categorical data will be analyzed using the Chi-squared or&#xD;
      Fischer's exact test. Weight growth velocities will be calculated using an exponential model&#xD;
      validated by Patel et al. from regained birth weight to discharge. Absolute measures of&#xD;
      growth (weight, length, head circumference) will be converted to Z-scores using a research&#xD;
      calculator (http://www.ucalgary.ca/fenton) based on parameters from the Fenton Preterm Growth&#xD;
      Chart.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Z-scores for growth parameters at six-months and 24 months will be calculated based on data&#xD;
      from the World Health Organization growth charts&#xD;
      (http://www.peditools.org/growthwho/index.php).&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. STUDY PROCEDURES Feeding Protocol Both parenteral nutrition and enteral feedings for&#xD;
      this study will be based on protocols that have long been used in our NICU and published.&#xD;
      Parenteral nutrition will be provided to both the RF and the SF groups in the same way. Total&#xD;
      parenteral nutrition (TPN) will be started on the day of birth with at least 1 g/kg/day of&#xD;
      protein (Premasol) and will be advanced as tolerated to a standard solution. The standard TPN&#xD;
      solution delivers 100 kcal/kg/day in 150 mL/kg/day, and contains 18.8 g/kg glucose, 3 g/kg&#xD;
      protein, and 2.5-3.0 g/kg lipid (Intralipid).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initiation of trophic feeds with MBM or preterm donor milk (PDM) will be started seven days&#xD;
      after birth and continued at 12 mL/kg/day for one week in both groups. Infants are fed by&#xD;
      gastric gavage every two hours until reaching a weight of 1250 g and every three hours&#xD;
      thereafter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After trophic feedings are completed, milk intake is advanced by 15 mL/kg/day as tolerated to&#xD;
      a volume of 150 mL/kg/d. Infants in the RF group will be started on Prolacta HMDF to achieve&#xD;
      milk with 24 kcal/oz and maintained at an intake of 150 mL/kg/day (120 kcal/kg/day). Infants&#xD;
      in the SF group will have human milk increased to 180 mL/kg/day (120 kcal/kg/day) and&#xD;
      maintained at this volume unless fortification is required. If weight gain is &lt;15 g/kg/day&#xD;
      after one week of intake at 180 mL/kg/day, fortification will be started in the SF group and&#xD;
      feeds will be decreased to 150 mL/kg/day. If weight gain remains &lt; 15g/kg/day after one week&#xD;
      of fortified milk at 150 ml/kg/day in either the RF or SF groups, the intake will be&#xD;
      increased to 165ml/kg/day ( 132 kcal/kg/day). Intralipid and parenteral nutrition will be&#xD;
      discontinued when enteral feedings reach 80 and 100 mL/kg/day, respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Per our NICU's current standard of care, feedings will be decreased or stopped for emesis,&#xD;
      bile stained gastric residuals, or abdominal distension. Feedings will not be advanced if the&#xD;
      previous day's residuals exceeded 10% of daily volume. If feeds are stopped, they will be&#xD;
      restarted without fortification; if fortification was being used prior to a stoppage, it will&#xD;
      be resumed once the infant is tolerating feeds of 150 mL/kg/day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the case of a blood transfusion, feedings will be modified as per our standard of care.&#xD;
      Feeds will be cut back to 100-120 mL/kg/day and fortification will be stopped in both study&#xD;
      groups. Following the transfusion, feeds will be advanced by up to 20 mL/kg/day.&#xD;
      Fortification can be resumed 24 hours after the blood transfusion is completed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Infants in the study will have daily weight checks, along with weekly recumbent length&#xD;
      measurements and head circumference measurements. These growth parameters will be followed&#xD;
      until 35 weeks adjusted age, which is the earliest infants can be discharged home from our&#xD;
      NICU. In case infants are transferred to an outlying NICU prior to discharge, growth&#xD;
      parameters will continue to be followed at the accepting hospital. After 35 weeks adjusted&#xD;
      age, infants will be fed maternal milk if available or a preterm infant formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection In addition to the growth data described above, baseline patient&#xD;
      demographics, clinical characteristics, nutrition information, and NICU outcomes will be&#xD;
      collected on all patients. The demographics and characteristics will include birth weight,&#xD;
      gestational age, sex, race, inborn/outborn status, receipt of maternal betamethasone, mode of&#xD;
      delivery (vaginal or cesarean section), and Apgar score at 5 minutes. Nutritional information&#xD;
      will include day of first enteral feeding, type of first enteral feeding (MBM, PDM,&#xD;
      combination), duration of trophic feedings (&lt; 20 mL/kg/day), duration of TPN (days), duration&#xD;
      of need for intravenous fluids (days), days to full enteral feedings, enteral feeding at full&#xD;
      feeds (MBM, PDM, combination), time of human milk fortification (days of life), and enteral&#xD;
      feeding at 35 weeks adjusted for prematurity (MBM, PDM, combination). NICU outcomes will&#xD;
      include grade III/IV intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH), duration of mechanical ventilation,&#xD;
      surfactant therapy, use of postnatal steroids, bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), nosocomial&#xD;
      infection, spontaneous intestinal perforation (SIP), necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), length&#xD;
      of stay, number of blood product transfusions, and discharge disposition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Follow-Up Infants will be seen in our NICU Follow-up clinic at six months, 15 months, and 24&#xD;
      months adjusted age, which is our current standard of care. At these visits, a health history&#xD;
      including hospitalizations and diet will be collected. Growth parameters-weight, length, and&#xD;
      head circumference-will be measured and a neurodevelopmental assessment using the Bayley&#xD;
      Scales of Infant and Toddler Development will be administered. Developmental assessments are&#xD;
      conducted by staff blinded to prior feeding history.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data &amp; Safety An independent safety monitoring committee composed of an attending&#xD;
      neonatologist (Dr. Ellen Bifano) and milk bank personnel will meet after the first 20&#xD;
      patients are enrolled and periodically to monitor safety during the study. Specifically,&#xD;
      feeding related morbidities like NEC will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All study data will be compiled into an electronic database, which will be kept in a secure&#xD;
      password-protected computer in the principal investigator's locked office on the ninth floor&#xD;
      of Crouse Hospital. The study subjects' personal health information including name, date of&#xD;
      birth, and medical record numbers will be used to identify subjects, and their study&#xD;
      information will be part of their medical record. A copy of the data collection form and data&#xD;
      analysis form will be submitted along with this protocol and application.&#xD;
