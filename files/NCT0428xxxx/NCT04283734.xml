      Randomized controlled trial to determinate if the physiological iFR pullback evaluation with&#xD;
      Syncvision software (intervention group) could be useful in the reduction of stent length&#xD;
      implanted, with the potencial benefit in terms of MACEs reduction at follow-up with respect&#xD;
      to angiographic guiding of percutaneous coronary intervention (control group).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Physiological coronary lesion evaluation is actually a routine practice in the labs to guide&#xD;
      percutaneous coronary intervention decision making. Unlike FFR, the new index permit us to&#xD;
      perform an analysis of the physiological importance of every lesion and every coronary&#xD;
      segment. This fact has allowed to create a new specific software. Syncvision show us the&#xD;
      functional compromise of every lesion and predict the expected IFR improvement.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This potential benefit could have an extra benefit in the reduction of the implanted stent&#xD;
      length. There are some observational study published that reported a reduction of 5 mm of&#xD;
      stent length, but we think that the reduction could be significantly higher.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, this reduction could be detrimental of the complete cover of plaque in this type of&#xD;
      lesion, which has also proved to be a predictor of MACEs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For this reason, we have proposed to perform a randomized study to define if the utilization&#xD;
      of physiological IFR pullback evaluation in long and/or diffuse coronary lesion present&#xD;
      advantages over classical angiographic PCI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study hyphotesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Revascularization guided by IFR-Pullback in long and/or diffuse coronary lesions permit to&#xD;
      reduce the stent length implanted, with the potential benefit in terms of MACEs reduction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomized and controlled study where we will include patients with significant coronary&#xD;
      stenosis at least in one vessel and a total lesion length higher than 30 mm in the different&#xD;
      clinical scenarios (stable angina, NSTEMI and STEMI in non-culprit lesion).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group, stent length will be decided by the operator. In the iFR-pullback&#xD;
      group, stent length will be decided in base to iFR expected, trying to obtain an IFR of 0.90&#xD;
      with the minimum stent length as possible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The expected stent length reduction is 15 mm (primary endpoint). As secondary endpoint, we&#xD;
      will analyze the combined endpoint of myocardial infarction, death and new&#xD;
      revascularization).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size in base to primary endpoint will be of 100 patients.&#xD;
