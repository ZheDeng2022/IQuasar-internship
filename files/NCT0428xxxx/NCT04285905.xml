  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall aim of the mPATCH-TB Study is to identify potentially cost-effective, feasible&#xD;
      and scalable interventions that could increase rates of completion of screening for&#xD;
      tuberculosis and HIV among male partners of women attending primary health care in Blantyre,&#xD;
      Malawi.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible women who consent to participate - and who have a primary male partner with cough at&#xD;
      home -will be randomly allocated, by day of clinic attendance, into a standard of care group&#xD;
      or one of up to four intervention groups. They will be asked to identify their primary male&#xD;
      partner and will be offered interventions according to their allocated group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome will compare the proportion of primary male partner that complete TB&#xD;
      screening (defined as receipt of result of a sputum Xpert or smear result) within 14 days of&#xD;
      recruitment in each intervention group compared to the enhanced standard of care group.&#xD;
