  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This research study is for participants that have been diagnosed with intractable Obsessive&#xD;
      -compulsive disorder (OCD). OCD is a persistent and oftentimes disabling disorder marked by&#xD;
      unwanted and distressing thoughts (obsessions) and irresistible repetitive behaviors. OCD&#xD;
      affects 2-3% of the US population, and is responsible for substantial functional impairment&#xD;
      and increased risk of early death.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The only established first-line treatments for OCD are cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT)&#xD;
      with exposure/response prevention and certain medications. About 30-40% of patients fail to&#xD;
      respond and few experience complete symptom resolution. Up to 25% of patients have difficulty&#xD;
      tolerating CBT and the risk of relapse after therapies remains large. For the most severe&#xD;
      cases, neurosurgery (surgery in the brain), has long been the option of last resort.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study the investigators want develop an adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation (aDBS) system&#xD;
      to use in subjects with intractable (hard to control) OCD. Deep brain stimulation remains&#xD;
      investigational for OCD patients and is not considered standard therapy. DBS involves the&#xD;
      surgical implantation of leads and electrodes into specific areas of the brain, which are&#xD;
      thought to influence the disease. A pack implanted in the chest, called the neurotransmitter,&#xD;
      keeps the electrical current coursing to the brain through a wire that connects the&#xD;
      neurotransmitter and electrodes. It is believed deep brain stimulation may restore balance to&#xD;
      dysfunctional brain circuitry implicated in OCD. The goal of this study is to enhance current&#xD;
      approaches to DBS targeting in the brain and to use a novel approach to find a better and&#xD;
      more reliable system for OCD treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current research protocol will focus on the completion of Phase Ib which will implant&#xD;
      the RC+S system in 2 subjects.&#xD;

      ENROLLMENT: A subject is considered enrolled upon signing informed consent, deemed eligible&#xD;
      to be screened by the investigator. The informed consent process may include discussions with&#xD;
      the patient¿s family and referring clinician. Medical records that can be obtained will be&#xD;
      carefully reviewed to determine adequacy of past treatments including Cognitive Behavioral&#xD;
      Therapy (CBT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subject identification number will be assigned to each subject that signs consent. This&#xD;
      number will be used to identify the subject and must be used on all study documentation&#xD;
      related to that subject throughout the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCREENING: Potential subjects meeting inclusion/exclusion criteria and willing to participate&#xD;
      in the study as demonstrated by signing the informed consent will be enrolled in the study&#xD;
      and undergo 2 screening visits (Visit 1 and Visit 2) spaced over an approximate 1 month&#xD;
      period. Diagnostic and screening ratings are completed, followed by complete medical,&#xD;
      neurological and neurosurgical evaluations. Final selection of candidates will be made by&#xD;
      consensus of the multi-disciplinary investigator team (Project Advisory Committee).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neuroimaging Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBS implanted subjects will undergo 2- 3T MRI Scans prior to surgery (1 research MRI at CAMRI&#xD;
      and 1 clinical MRI at BSLMC). DBS implanted subjects will under 3 MEGs total.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Control subjects will undergo 1- 3T MRI scan (research MRI scan at CAMRI). Control subjects&#xD;
      will also undergo 3 MEG scans.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Center for Advanced MR Imaging (CAMRI) at the Main Campus location of Baylor College of&#xD;
      will perform the research 3T MRI scans, which will only be collected on all subjects (DBS and&#xD;
      control) using the Prisma scanner on this project for consistency.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT: Subjects eligible for DBS implantation will also have an additional clinical,&#xD;
      pre-surgical 3T MRI scan performed at baseline. This scan will be performed on a Philips&#xD;
      scanner at Baylor St. Luke's Medical Center (BSLMC). This scan is necessary in order to&#xD;
      potentially screen out individuals presenting with brain abnormalities which would not be&#xD;
      compatible with the surgery (e.g., congenital defects, lack of normal anatomic correlates)&#xD;
      and to assist with surgical planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All Subjects (DBS and control) will also undergo MEG scans. This is also needed as a baseline&#xD;
      assessment as MEG scans will also be performed post implantation at 2 weeks and 6 months.&#xD;
      These scans will be performed on a MEG scanner at the Texas Children¿s Hospital in the&#xD;
      Houston Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest X-ray and EKG will also be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Age/gender matched non-implanted subjects will serve as controls. They will undergo&#xD;
      1-research 3T MRI and 3 MEG scans using the same imaging protocol and at the same time points&#xD;
      as OCD implant subjects to control for non-DBS effects on rs-fc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TREATMENT:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Unless collected prior to the day of surgery, A a head CT will be performed on the&#xD;
           morning of surgery for stereotactic planning.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Employing local anesthetic (with or without sedation as clinically indicated), a&#xD;
           stereotactic headframe (Leksell Model G, Elekta Instruments, Atlanta, GA, USA) will be&#xD;
           attached to the subject¿s skull on the morning of surgery in the operating room.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. A 3D volumetric image (O-Arm 2, Medtronic Inc, Boulder, CO, USA) will be performed for&#xD;
           purposes of defining the volumetric stereotactic headspace.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. The images will be uploaded onto a Computer Workstation (Stealth S7, Medtronic, Inc.,&#xD;
           Boulder, CO, USA) equipped with stereotactic planning software (Cranial 3.0) for the&#xD;
           purpose of planning the surgery. The preoperative 3T MRI obtained prior to the surgical&#xD;
           date, will be fused with the CT scan in the surgical planning station. The initial&#xD;
           target point within the ventral striatum will be chosen based on the subject¿s specific&#xD;
           anatomy. The surgical trajectory to this point will also be planned in order to avoid&#xD;
           prominent vessels, the sulci, and the ventricles. The computer will generate the X, Y&#xD;
           and Z coordinates to set on the frame as well as the coronal and sagittal angles of&#xD;
           approach required to establish the desired trajectory and target point. This initial&#xD;
           target point will be modified by the subject¿s specific anatomy as determined by the&#xD;
           preoperative 3T scan. The final target coordinates will be determined during this&#xD;
           analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. While the surgeon is planning the procedure, the subject will be positioned supine on&#xD;
           the operating table. A Foley catheter will be inserted. Antibiotics will be administered&#xD;
           intravenously and vital signs will be monitored. The stereotactic head frame will be&#xD;
           fixed to the operating table for subject safety, with the head elevated for subject&#xD;
           comfort. A sterile prep and drape will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. The target coordinates will be set on the stereotactic frame bringing the target point&#xD;
           to the center of the operating arc. Additional local anesthetic will be given at the&#xD;
           point of incision. Following incision, a 14 mm burr hole will be made employing a&#xD;
           self-stopping perforator. The burr hole cap provided with the DBS lead will be secured&#xD;
           to the skull with two screws. The dura will be coagulated and incised. The pial surface&#xD;
           will be gently coagulated and a small incision will be made to allow easy entry of the&#xD;
           electrode guides, which will be inserted to the brain according to standard stereotactic&#xD;
           protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. A microelectrode (MER) probe will be inserted through the cannula and advanced in sub mm&#xD;
           steps until the target is reached. Intraoperative image guidance will be obtained to&#xD;
           ensure the MER probe is not mechanically deviated from target. If a deviation is&#xD;
           identified, the stereotactic headframe will be adjusted accordingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Once the above adjustments have been made, the DBS quadripolar electrode (model 3387;&#xD;
           Medtronic Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) will be inserted through the guide tube to the&#xD;
           target point. Reticles will be attached to the frame and intraoperative imaging will be&#xD;
           employed to confirm that the lead tip is positioned at the target and assess for the&#xD;
           presence of intracerebral hemorrhage. Sedation will be withdrawn. An extension cable&#xD;
           will be connected to the lead sterilely and the other end will be passed off the field&#xD;
           to be connected to an external pulse generator so that test stimulation may be&#xD;
           performed. Test stimulation will be performed via each contact to 1) assess for&#xD;
           stimulation-induced side effects and 2) monitor for acute changes in behavior using a&#xD;
           Likert-type scale to assess anxiety, arousal, and mood. Intra operative behavioral&#xD;
           testing of stimulation will be videotaped&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. Intra-operative X-ray imaging may be performed as needed (up to 4 times per side) to&#xD;
           ensure proper target has been reached.&#xD;
&#xD;
       10. A post-implantation 3D volumetric scan will be performed to confirm the electrode&#xD;
           position.&#xD;
&#xD;
       11. Steps 5-9 above will be performed to insert the second electrode on the other side of&#xD;
           the brain to complete implantation of both electrodes.&#xD;
&#xD;
       12. If there are no untenable side effects, the leads will be secured to the skull with the&#xD;
           burr hole caps. The free end of the leads will be left in the sub-galeal space and the&#xD;
           incisions will be closed in anatomical layers.&#xD;
&#xD;
       13. The headframe will be removed and general anesthesia will be induced. The Olympus RC+S&#xD;
           pulse generator will then be implanted and connected to the brain lead via extension&#xD;
           cables.&#xD;
&#xD;
       14. A post-operative CT scan will be performed prior to discharge to ensure that an&#xD;
           intracerebral hemorrhage has not occurred.&#xD;
&#xD;
       15. The subject will be taken to the Recovery Room or the Neurosurgery ICU for&#xD;
           post-operative monitoring (See below) and will be discharged from the hospital after at&#xD;
           least one night of observation and when clinically stable. A Basic Metabolic Panel (BMP)&#xD;
           may be run on the subject to confirm they are clinically stable.&#xD;
&#xD;
       16. The subject will return to the neurosurgery clinic (Visit 4) for post-operative&#xD;
           evaluation according to normal clinical practice (approximately 1 week after surgery).&#xD;
           The wounds will be inspected and the subjects neurological status will be assessed.&#xD;
           Sutures will be removed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be asked to keep their current medications constant for the first 6 months&#xD;
      post-surgery, but clinical circumstances which mandate changes will be allowed and notated&#xD;
      should this occur.&#xD;
&#xD;
      DBS Programming:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Initially, a monopolar survey will be conducted with frequency set to 130 Hz and pulse width&#xD;
      to 90 microseconds. Constant current amplitude will be used and increased in a step-wise&#xD;
      fashion as tolerated and without exceeding current density upper limits. The constant current&#xD;
      setting is particularly useful in the early weeks to months following surgery when impedances&#xD;
      are still changing. In order to elicit a mirth response, amplitude needs to return to 0&#xD;
      microamps for about 30 seconds before testing the next increment. For example, if 2mA, C+1,&#xD;
      90usec, 130Hz is ineffective, then amplitude is reduced to 0mA for 30 seconds and then&#xD;
      rapidly increased to 4mA, C+1-, 90usec, 130Hz. Soft start needs to be turned off. Bipolar&#xD;
      settings will also be tested and need to be used during rsfMRI. DBS parameters will be&#xD;
      optimized/adjusted based on clinical evaluation of mood and anxiety and to minimize side&#xD;
      effects. The following observed effects will be recorded via a scale used in a past study:&#xD;
      facial expression, nervousness, alertness, and positive or negative affect. Facial expression&#xD;
      will be measured using the AFAR system. AFAR will measure the maximum intensity and velocity&#xD;
      of the smile response in action units. Participants¿ faces will be recorded on video as their&#xD;
      stimulation is increased to elicit the mirth response. Changes in facial expression using&#xD;
      facial muscles of orbicularis oris (muscle that encircles the mouth) zygomaticus (major and&#xD;
      minor muscles of the angle of the mouth) will be recorded. This information will be used to&#xD;
      train a classifier to recognize that stimulation intensity is too great. The investigators&#xD;
      will also have the subject self-report on changes in mood, anxiety, energy and side effects.&#xD;
