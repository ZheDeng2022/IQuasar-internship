  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Ovarian germ cell tumors (OGCTs) constitute 10% of ovarian tumors in Egypt and mainly affect&#xD;
      young females. Teratomas are the most common type.Most of teratomas is benign. However, it is&#xD;
      liable for malignant transformation. Others are malignant including dysgerminoma, immature&#xD;
      teratoma, yolk sac tumor,.etc and accounts 1-1.5% of cancers in young females. The&#xD;
      pathogenesis of OGCTs is not clearly understood.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P16 is a member of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors. It arrests the cell cycle in G1&#xD;
      phase, so it is known as a tumor suppressor protein.P16 immunohistochemical(IHC) expression&#xD;
      has been widely investigated in different cancers. Its IHC expression is either absent or&#xD;
      overexpressed. Overexpression of p16 is documented in Human Papilloma Virus related&#xD;
      endocervical neoplasms and High grade squamous intraepithelial lesions of the vulvovaginal&#xD;
      region.Absence of p16 expression is detected in multiple cancers such as Lung cancer,&#xD;
      colorectal cancer and lymphoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      P16 IHC expression in OGCTs is poorly investigated. One study suggests that absent p16 is&#xD;
      involved in proliferation of malignant OGCTs via molecular assessment.Another study suggested&#xD;
      that decrease P16 is involved in malignant transformation of Mature cystic teratoma to&#xD;
      squamous cell carcinoma.However, Previous studies are still limited and recommended further&#xD;
      studies to confirm its results.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As the role of altered P16 protein in OGCTs is not widely investigated, we hypothesized that&#xD;
      abnormal P16 expression may be involved in its pathogenesis and germ stem cell&#xD;
      proliferation.This will give more information about molecular pathways of germ stem cell&#xD;
      proliferation to give a hope for CDK inhibitors as novel target therapies in the management&#xD;
      of OGCTs.&#xD;

      In this study , we aim to :&#xD;
&#xD;
      1-Evaluate the immunohistochemical expression of p16 in neoplastic component of benign and&#xD;
      malignant OGCTs and scoring its immunoreactivity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      2-Correlate between P16 immunohistochemical expression in MOGCTs with Ki 67 proliferating&#xD;
      index and FIGO staging.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
                  -  The study protocol was approved by the Institutional Review Board at Faculty&#xD;
                     of medicine, Assiut University in December, 2019 (IRB No.17100871) and Ethical&#xD;
                     approval for this study was obtained from the committee of medical ethics,&#xD;
                     Faculty of medicine, Assiut University.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Study Setting: IHC lab of Pathology department, Faculty of medicine, Assiut&#xD;
                     University.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Tissue sampling: Sixty-two formalin fixed ,paraffin wax-embedded ovarian&#xD;
                     specimens were obtained from departments of surgical pathology in Assiut&#xD;
                     University Hospital (AUH) and South Egypt cancer institute (SECI) from January&#xD;
                     2010 to January 2021. These specimens includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
                (Group A) 22 malignant ovarian germ cell tumors (MOGCTs), (Group B) 20 apparent&#xD;
                normal ovarian tissue as a control group and (Group C) 20 mature cystic teratomas&#xD;
                as equal benign comparison group.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Group A constitutes 5 dysgerminomas, 8 immature teratomas (four of them Grade II&#xD;
                and the other four are Grade III, FIGO grading system) and 9 yolk sac tumors. The&#xD;
                patients ranged in age from 12 to 23 years (median age 16.5 years). The initial&#xD;
                diagnosis of each MOGCTs was re-evaluated according to the WHO Classification of&#xD;
                Ovarian Tumors.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Group B includes normally apparent ovaries that surgically resected with specimens&#xD;
                of total abdominal hysterectomy and salpingo-opherctomy for non-ovarian,&#xD;
                non-malignant causes as multiple fibroid uterus and adenomyosis as a control group.&#xD;
                The patients ranged in age from 42 to 64 years (median 50 years old).&#xD;
&#xD;
                All available Hematoxylin and eosin stained slides were examined by two independent&#xD;
                pathologists by routine light microscopy and the most representative one or two&#xD;
                tissue blocks were used for immunohistochemical staining. The clinical and&#xD;
                pathological data includes age, grade, stage, recurrence of lesions were evaluated&#xD;
                according to pathological reports.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Immunohistochemistry: The tissue samples were formalin-fixed, paraffin&#xD;
                     embedded tissue blocks, and were stored at room temperature. Thin sections of&#xD;
                     4 um thickness were cut from selected representative tissue blocks, and were&#xD;
                     taken on to coated slides, kept in an oven at 70-C for 25 minutes,&#xD;
                     deparaffinized by washing in two containers of xylene for 15 minutes for each&#xD;
                     and rehydrated through serial dilutions (100% , 90% , 80% , 70 %) of alcohol&#xD;
                     for 5 minutes in each dilution. Then, sections were treated by 3% Hydrogen&#xD;
                     peroxide for 10 minutes to prevent nonspecific background followed by PBS&#xD;
                     buffer wash 4 times adequately. For antigen retrieval, the slides were kept in&#xD;
                     citrate buffer (PH = 6) and autoclaved at 90-C for 15 minutes and left to cool&#xD;
                     to room temperature. The slides were washed with PBS buffer 4 times adequately&#xD;
                     and the tissue sections were incubated with primary antibody; p16INK4a&#xD;
                     Recombinant Rabbit Monoclonal Antibody (RM267) (MA5-27905) at a dilution of&#xD;
                     1:500 overnight, followed by incubation with secondary antibody; Polyvalent&#xD;
                     polymer-HRP for 10 minutes for each step followed by adequate 4 times of PBS&#xD;
                     buffer wash. The tissues were then treated with Diaminobenzidine chromogen&#xD;
                     (DAP-chromogen) for brown color development for 10 minutes. Then, sections&#xD;
                     were treated by Mayer hematoxylin as the counter stain for 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                For sections received from malignant cases only , we add additional Ki67 IHC&#xD;
                staining as tissue sections after deparffinization and blocking by 3% hydrogen&#xD;
                peroxidase were incubated with primary antibody; Ki67 antibody (DAKO), ready to use&#xD;
                for 20 minutes, followed by incubation with secondary antibody; Polyvalent&#xD;
                polymer-HRP for 20 minutes, followed treatment with Diaminobenzidine chromogen&#xD;
                (DAP-chromogen) for brown color development for 5 minutes. Then, sections were&#xD;
                treated by Mayer hematoxylin as the counter stain for 2 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The slides were washed by tap water, dehydrated through serial dilutions of&#xD;
                alcohol, washed by xylene for a short period, and mounted with DPX.&#xD;
&#xD;
                The normal apparent ovarian tissues were used as controls. Sections from cervical&#xD;
                non keratinized Squamous cell carcinoma with block p16 expression, were used as&#xD;
                positive controls; and the tissue slides without the primary antibody treatment&#xD;
                served as the negative controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
                -Immunohistochemical evaluation: For P16 IHC staining, the percentage of P16&#xD;
                positive cells and the location of positive signals (nuclear or cytoplasmic) were&#xD;
                visually estimated for neoplastic components of all lesions. German&#xD;
                Semi-quantitative scoring system were used to evaluate P16 expression as every&#xD;
                tumor will be given a score according to the intensity of the cytoplasmic and&#xD;
                nucleic staining (no staining = 0, weak staining = 1, moderate staining = 2, strong&#xD;
                staining = 3) And the extent of stained cells (0% = 0, 1-10% = 1, 11-50% =2, 51-80%&#xD;
                = 3, 81-100% = 4). The final immunoreactive score will be determined by multiplying&#xD;
                the intensity scores with the extent of positivity scores of stained cells, with&#xD;
                the minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 12 ( score 0, 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 and 12).&#xD;
&#xD;
                For KI67 IHC staining for malignant cases only, percentage of nuclear positivity&#xD;
                stained cells were assessed, regardless intensity of staining in all sections&#xD;
                examined (at least 1000 tumor cells were counted per section for estimation of KI&#xD;
                index).&#xD;
&#xD;
                -Statistical analysis: Data were analysed using IBM-SPSS version 24. Numerical data&#xD;
                were presented as mean and standard deviation, while categorical data were&#xD;
                presented as number and percentage. Descriptive statistics: Means, standard&#xD;
                deviations, medians, ranges, and percentages were calculated. Test of&#xD;
                significances: for continuous variables with more than two categories; ANOVA test&#xD;
                was calculated to test the mean differences of the data that follow normal&#xD;
                distribution and independent sample Kruskal-Wallis was used to compare the median&#xD;
                difference between groups that do not follow normal distribution, post-hoc test was&#xD;
                calculated using Bonferroni corrections. Correlation analysis was used (Spearman'&#xD;
                Ranked correlation, 2-tailed).&#xD;
&#xD;
                A p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered significant.&#xD;

        <description>For P16 IHC staining, the percentage of P16 positive cells and the location of positive signals (nuclear or cytoplasmic) were visually estimated for neoplastic components of all lesions. German Semi-quantitative scoring system were used to evaluate P16 expression as every tumor will be given a score according to the intensity of the cytoplasmic and nucleic staining (no staining = 0, weak staining = 1, moderate staining = 2, strong staining = 3) And the extent of stained cells (0% = 0, 1-10% = 1, 11-50% =2, 51-80% = 3, 81-100% = 4). The final immunoreactive score will be determined by multiplying the intensity scores with the extent of positivity scores of stained cells, with the minimum score of 0 and a maximum score of 12 ( score 0, 1,2,3,4,6,8,9 and 12).</description>
