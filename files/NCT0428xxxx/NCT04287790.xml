      Medications for Alcohol use disorder (MAUD) (acamprosate, naltrexone, and disulfiram) remain&#xD;
      underutilized despite guideline recommendations and rising alcohol-related morbidity and&#xD;
      mortality. Alcohol use disorder (AUD)-related hospitalizations are opportunities to initiate&#xD;
      MAUD, but optimal implementation strategies are unclear. We will complete a 6 month pilot&#xD;
      implementation intervention involving audit and feedback, educational meetings, and academic&#xD;
      detailing for health professionals at Yale New Haven Hospital to determine the impact on: 1)&#xD;
      health professional satisfaction with intervention components, 2) health professional&#xD;
      knowledge and attitudes about medications for alcohol use disorder, 3) receipt of medication&#xD;
      among hospitalized patients diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder and 4) 30 day readmission&#xD;
      among hospitalized patients with alcohol use disorder. Health professional satisfaction and&#xD;
      knowledge with be assessed using a pre-post design and receipt of medications and 30 day&#xD;
      readmission will be assessed using a interrupted time series design. We hypothesize health&#xD;
      professional knowledge and attitudes about MAUD will be greater after the pilot intervention&#xD;
      compared to before. We hypothesize receipt of MAUD will be greater after the pilot&#xD;
      intervention compared to before. We hypothesize 30 day readmission will be less after the&#xD;
      pilot intervention compared to before.&#xD;

      detailing for health professionals at Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) to determine the impact&#xD;
      on: 1) health professional satisfaction with intervention components, 2) health professional&#xD;
      knowledge and attitudes about medications for alcohol use disorder, 3) receipt of medication&#xD;
      among hospitalized patients diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder and 4) 30 day readmission&#xD;

&#xD;
      Population and setting for implementation intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health professionals (physicians, advanced practice providers, pharmacists, social workers,&#xD;
      and nurses) who work on the designated general medicine services (9-5, 4-6 and 4-7) at Yale&#xD;
      New Haven Hospital.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Implementation intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our implementation intervention will incorporate the following strategies: 1) Formation of an&#xD;
      alcohol-related care working group. This voluntary working group will consist of members of&#xD;
      the research team and volunteer health professionals from YNHH. The group with supervise and&#xD;
      support the other intervention components. 2) We will develop medication for alcohol use&#xD;
      disorder marketing (posters and buttons) materials and educational (pamphlet) materials and&#xD;
      distribute these materials to health professionals. 3) Building on the existing&#xD;
      infrastructure and collaboration, the research team will assist in revising existing&#xD;
      alcohol-related care daily monitoring systems to support auditing and feedback on the&#xD;
      adoption of medications for alcohol use disorder at YNHH. 4) The research team will hold&#xD;
      educational meetings and educational outreach visits (academic detailing) when invited during&#xD;
      regular noon conferences and team meetings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Health professional outcomes: health professional satisfaction and knowledge Using the&#xD;
      pre-post design, data collection will consist of two surveys. One survey will assess health&#xD;
      professional knowledge and attitudes about MAUD at baseline and then again at 6 months post&#xD;
      intervention. A follow up survey will assess health professional satisfaction with the&#xD;
      intervention components collected following educational events and at 6 months post&#xD;
      intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with AUD outcomes: receipt of medication among hospitalized patients diagnosed with&#xD;
      an alcohol use disorder (primary outcome) and 30 day readmission among patient with alcohol&#xD;
      use disorder. Using an interrupted time series design, data will be obtained from Epic&#xD;
      electronic medical record at Yale New Haven Hospital in partnership with the Joint Data&#xD;
      Analytics Team (JDAT) to whom we will submit our formal data request. Patients discharged&#xD;
      from the general medicine service at Yale New Haven Hospital York street campus following&#xD;
      hospitalization for an alcohol related diagnosis 18 months before and 12 months after the&#xD;
      start (January 1st 2020) of the implementation intervention.&#xD;
