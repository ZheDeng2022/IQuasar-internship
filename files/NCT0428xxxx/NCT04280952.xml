  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prognosis of glioblastoma patients highly depends on resection extent. Various strategies&#xD;
      have been introduced to overcome the dilemma of intraoperative tumor identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In gastroenterology, confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) allows precise differentiation of&#xD;
      tumor tissue from surrounding mucosa in various diseases. Combining high-definition white&#xD;
      light endoscopy with CLE significantly increases sensitivity and specificity compared with&#xD;
      the sole application of high-definition white light endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLE was recently introduced to neurosurgical applications. Although still in an early stage&#xD;
      of clinical application, this technique has proven to be capable of differentiating various&#xD;
      tumor entities in animal models as well as human tissue samples. CLE allows visualization of&#xD;
      the underlying tissue on a microscopic scale, receiving information on the microstructure as&#xD;
      well as cellular components. However, the clinical importance of this technique for its&#xD;
      application in neurosurgery will be demonstrated in this clinical trial.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The prognosis of glioblastoma patients highly depends on resection extent. Various strategies&#xD;
      have been introduced to overcome the dilemma of intraoperative tumor identification.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In gastroenterology, confocal laser endomicroscopy (CLE) allows precise differentiation of&#xD;
      tumor tissue from surrounding mucosa in various diseases. Combining high-definition white&#xD;
      light endoscopy with CLE significantly increases sensitivity and specificity compared with&#xD;
      the sole application of high-definition white light endoscopy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CLE was recently introduced to neurosurgical applications. Although still in an early stage&#xD;
      of clinical application, this technique has proven to be capable of differentiating various&#xD;
      tumor entities in animal models as well as human tissue samples. CLE allows visualization of&#xD;
      the underlying tissue on a microscopic scale, receiving information on the microstructure as&#xD;
      well as cellular components. However, the clinical importance of this technique for its&#xD;
      application in neurosurgery still needs to be demonstrated&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intravenous injection dose of fluorescein sodium. For every operation the investigators plan&#xD;
      to take pictures with the CONVIVO system before taking the material for standard frozen&#xD;
      section and definitive histopathology. These pictures will be evaluated by a pathologist&#xD;
      afterwards.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this trial is to demonstrate, that the CONVIVO system allows&#xD;
      identification of tumor tissue. The secondary objectives are procedural aspects and handling&#xD;
      issues covering the usability.&#xD;
