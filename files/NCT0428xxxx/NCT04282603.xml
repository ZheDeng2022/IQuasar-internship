      Sarcopenic obesity in older individuals presents a clinical conundrum without an effective&#xD;
      therapeutic strategy. This study will determine the impact of precision amino acid delivery&#xD;
      as part of a meal replacement (EMR) during weight loss on the preservation of lean tissue and&#xD;
      improvements in metabolic health and physical function in older obese adults. Following&#xD;
      weight loss, the investigators will examine whether one serving/day of EMR will sustain the&#xD;
      above stated benefits.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The health status of the aging population is negatively affected by sarcopenic obesity as&#xD;
      described by the progressive loss of lean tissue and an increase in adipose tissue. This&#xD;
      condition presents a clinical conundrum as it predisposes older obese individuals to a high&#xD;
      risk for disability, morbidity and mortality. Insulin resistance, chronic inflammation,&#xD;
      elevations in intrahepatic lipid and detrimental alterations in the gut microbiome are also&#xD;
      evident. The application of caloric restriction-induced weight loss (CRWL) used to address&#xD;
      these health risks in younger individuals may exacerbate muscle wasting and increase&#xD;
      morbidity in older adults. Unfortunately, low fitness levels and poor compliance limit the&#xD;
      mitigating influence of weight loss through exercise training on sarcopenic obesity. In order&#xD;
      to address anabolic resistance or the decreased ability to maintain protein synthesis that&#xD;
      contributes to sarcopenic obesity, the investigators have developed a complete meal&#xD;
      replacement that contains a mechanism-targeted profile of essential amino acids (17 grams).&#xD;
      This profile is designed to overcome anabolic resistance and maintain net protein balance&#xD;
      even in the hypocaloric state. It is our overarching hypothesis that EMR will promote the&#xD;
      retention of lean tissue mass, and improve metabolic and functional outcomes following 12&#xD;
      weeks of CRWL, and that those endpoints will be sustained over a 12 week maintenance period&#xD;
      with the once per day (q.d.) consumption of EMR. The investigators will randomly assign older&#xD;
      obese individuals to either EMR or an isocaloric serving of Bariatrics Advantage (meal&#xD;
      replacement that contains 27 grams of intact protein) during these interventions. The&#xD;
      investigators will execute these specific aims to test our hypotheses: SA1. Establish the&#xD;
      importance of EMR in the preservation of lean tissue mass during CRWL. Lean tissue mass and&#xD;
      adipose tissue mass will be determined by dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA) and magnetic&#xD;
      resonance imaging/spectroscopy (MRI/MRS) scans. MRI/MRS will be used to measure intrahepatic&#xD;
      lipid, and the investigators will evaluate alterations in insulin sensitivity using the HOMA&#xD;
      score. The investigators will measure potential changes in gut microbiota in collaboration&#xD;
      with Dr. Duddleston at the University of Alaska Anchorage. SA2. Determine the influence of&#xD;
      EMR on physical function and increased daily activity during CRWL. Slow walking speed is a&#xD;
      strong predictor of morbidity and mortality. The investigators chose the 6-minute walk test&#xD;
      to represent the primary endpoint for this aim. The investigators will also determine&#xD;
      alterations in gait speed, skeletal muscle power and strength and stair climbing ability, and&#xD;
      changes in physical activity using Actigraph GT3X+ devices. SA3. Identify whether EMR q.d.&#xD;
      will sustain improvements in body composition, physical function and metabolic parameters&#xD;
      over a 12 week, maintenance period following CRWL. Since the preservation of lean tissue mass&#xD;
      is directly linked to optimal function and metabolic health, the investigators will measure&#xD;
      the influence of EMR q.d. on the indices of metabolic health (ie., intrahepatic lipid,&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity) and physical function.&#xD;

    <masking_description>Eligible volunteers will be randomly assigned to one of two groups: Experimental Meal Replacement or Bariatrics Advantage Meal Replacement. Only the statistician will know to which group a subject is assigned. Identifying information with regard to randomization of participants to their assigned group will be stored in a binder with Case Report Forms. A master list linking participants to a number and their assigned group will be kept in a password protected file in the database by the study statistician. This process will ensure a high degree of scientific rigor.</masking_description>

    <ipd_description>Structured de-identified clinical data. Restrictive protocols will be in place for human data and for data, if any, owned by Alaska Native tribes. The PI, Data Manager and Project leader will review data requests using criteria including scientific value, appropriate research plan, protection of participant and community confidentiality, and dissemination plan. All persons working with COBRE human data will have to sign a Confidentiality Agreement, Publication Agreement, and submit proof of current Collaborative IRB Training Initiative (CITI) certification or an equivalent approved by the UAF IRB when appropriate. Data access is generally approved for three years, at which time data sets must be destroyed or the data access approval extended.</ipd_description>
