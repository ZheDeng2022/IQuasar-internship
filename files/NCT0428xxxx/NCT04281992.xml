  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a two-part phase 1/2A study performed in diabetic foot ulcer (DFU) patients with&#xD;
      chronic non-healing wounds to investigate the safety and efficacy of AUP1602-C.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study AP-W-CLI-2018-8 is the first clinical study of AUP1602-C in humans. It is a Phase 1/2A&#xD;
      clinical study to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of a single and repeated&#xD;
      doses of AUP-16 as topical treatment of DFU. The Phase 1 part will be a multicenter,&#xD;
      open-label, non-randomized, uncontrolled dose-finding study with sequential dose escalations&#xD;
      performed in dose cohorts comparing three doses of AUP-16 administered three times per week&#xD;
      (low, medium, and high dose cohorts). This part will consist of four sequentially recruited&#xD;
      cohorts. It is expected that a minimum of 15 patients may be required to determine the RP2D&#xD;
      in phase 1 part.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase 2A part, an extension of the Phase 1, will be a multi-center, open-label,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled study of the recommended AUP1602-C dose and administration&#xD;
      schedule from Phase 1 to confirm safety and to assess efficacy of the selected recommended&#xD;
      phase 2 dose and schedule in DFU patients.&#xD;
