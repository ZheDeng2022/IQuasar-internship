      Prospective, multi-center, randomized, single blind, controlled, noninferiority clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with previous bare-metal or drug-eluting coronary stent will be randomized 1:1 to&#xD;
      treatment with either the SELUTION SLR™ DEB or SOC to include contemporary DES&#xD;
      (zotarolimus-eluting stents and everolimus-eluting stents only) or non-DEB BA. A maximum of&#xD;
      418 randomized subjects will be included. Subjects will be followed for 5 years&#xD;
      post-intervention. Primary endpoint will be target lesion failure (TLF) determined at&#xD;
      12-month clinical follow-up.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Prospective, multi-center, randomized, single blind, controlled, noninferiority clinical&#xD;
      trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects with previous bare-metal or drug-eluting coronary stent and qualifying evidence for&#xD;
      ISR will be screened per the protocol inclusion and exclusion criteria to achieve a maximum&#xD;
      of 418 randomized subjects (includes 5% allowance for loss to follow-up). Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will be randomized 1:1 to treatment with either the SELUTION SLR™ DEB or SOC to include&#xD;
      contemporary DES (zotarolimus-eluting stents and everolimus-eluting stents only) or non-DEB&#xD;
      BA. A maximum of 20% of patients randomized to SOC will be treated with BA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization will be stratified by DES or bare-metal stent (BMS) ISR and whether there has&#xD;
      been previous repeat stenting of target lesion. Subjects with &gt; 2 previous repeat stent&#xD;
      procedures involving the target lesion will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will test for noninferiority of DEB versus SOC and additionally noninferiority of&#xD;
      DEB vs DES.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint will be target lesion failure (TLF) determined at 12-month clinical&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After initial randomized treatment subjects in the SOC group may receive DEB (including&#xD;
      SELUTION SLR™) treatment for recurrent clinical restenosis requiring a repeat target lesion&#xD;
      revascularization (TLR) (i.e. after the study primary endpoint has been failed).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subset of subjects (120 subjects including the first 60 randomized in the United States&#xD;
      (US) and first 60 randomized in Europe who receive successful study treatment) will undergo&#xD;
      planned angiographic follow-up at 12-13 months after completion of primary endpoint clinical&#xD;
      follow-up/assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12-13 months, and after clinical primary endpoint has been assessed, a subset of the&#xD;
      angiographic follow-up cohort (~60) will also undergo planned optical coherence tomography&#xD;
      (OCT) follow-up, 30 United States (US) and 30 Europe.&#xD;

    <description>For subjects randomized to the control group (SOC) the treating physician may chose to implant a commercially available DES or alternatively may use POBA only to treat the patient. The decision should be based on the treating physicians' assessment of the best treatment option for the individual patient. However, it is expected that patients with one prior stent will receive DES and patients with two prior stents will receive POBA. Treating physicians may deviate from this if it is determined to be in the best interest of the patient, but the justification for the treatment decision must be recorded in eCRF.&#xD;
Choice of DES is at the treating physician's discretion, but is limited to ZES and EES devices.</description>

    <description>The SELUTION Sustained Limus Release (SLR)™ drug-eluting balloon (DEB) catheter is a combination product consisting of a standard percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) balloon catheter coated with a drug (Sirolimus). The drug coating is formulated with Sirolimus microspheres suspended in a phospholipid blend. The balloon catheter component of the SELUTION SLR™ DEB is a conventional single use, sterile, rapid exchange catheter to dilate vascular lesions. The semi-compliant balloon is inflated for 60 seconds (minimum of 30 seconds) to transfer the Sirolimus loaded microspheres to the target vessel wall. The balloon is then deflated and removed from the body.</description>
