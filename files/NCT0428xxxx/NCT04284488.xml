    <textblock>
      An ascending dose study in patients with solid tumors to evaluate the safety, tolerability,&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will be conducted in two phases. In phase Ib, the safety and efficacy of different&#xD;
      dose levels of APG-1387 in combination with 240 mg toripalimab will be explored to determine&#xD;
      the recommended Phase 2 dose (RP2D) of APG-1387 in combination therapy, both administered as&#xD;
      a 30-minute intravenous (IV) infusion. The following proposed doses of APG-1387 are to be&#xD;
      evaluated: 20,30, or 45mg .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Phase II portion, will compromise 3 cohorts of 15-25 patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 3 cohorts will include the following:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Colorectal cancer&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nasopharyngeal carcinoma&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Non-small cell lung cancer with PD-1 antibody refractory or relapse.&#xD;
