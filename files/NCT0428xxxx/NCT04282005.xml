  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes&#xD;
      mellitus (T2DM) and is characterised by excess liver fat on imaging or histology. NAFLD&#xD;
      affects up to 25% of the Western population. It's more aggressive form is non-alcoholic&#xD;
      steatohepatitis (NASH) characterised by cell injury, inflammation and fibrosis, and is&#xD;
      associated with increased mortality from liver and cardiovascular disease. Currently, there&#xD;
      is no specific treatment for NASH. Diet and exercise-induced weight loss remain the only&#xD;
      recommended options. However, maintaining weight loss in the long term is difficult. There is&#xD;
      therefore a significant unmet need for effective therapy in patients with NASH that can&#xD;
      address the underlying mechanisms of disease. Although preliminary observational evidence&#xD;
      suggests that bariatric/metabolic surgery, especially RYGB can improve NASH, no controlled&#xD;
      trials to date has confirmed the efficacy of surgery compared to standard weight loss&#xD;
      programs. Also, while animal and clinical studies have shown that bariatric surgery exerts&#xD;
      weight-independent effects on glucose metabolism, it is yet unknown if the observed effects&#xD;
      of bariatric/metabolic surgery on NASH are due to weight loss alone or result from&#xD;
      additional, weight-independent mechanisms, like in the case of T2DM. If the effect of surgery&#xD;
      on inflammation, liver fibrosis and other mechanisms of cardiometabolic risk were found to be&#xD;
      independent on weight reduction, there would be profound and far-reaching implications for&#xD;
      both the treatment and the understanding of NASH, cardiovascular disease and obesity-related&#xD;
      cancers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This project will investigate the hypothesis that, similarly to surgical control of diabetes,&#xD;
      bariatric/metabolic surgery can also exert weight-independent effects on mechanisms of&#xD;
      disease in NAFLD/NASH (i.e. influence on lowgrade inflammation and markers of fibrosis)&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study's population includes patients with severe obesity (BMI &gt;35kg/m2 or &gt;32.5. kg/m2&#xD;
      if patient of South Asian, Caribbean or Black ethnicity) and non-alcoholic fatty liver&#xD;
      disease (NAFLD) who are eligible for bariatric/metabolic surgery and are on the waiting list&#xD;
      for either Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) or sleeve gastrectomy (SG) at King's College&#xD;
      Hospital. Patients who meet study criteria will be assigned to the study groups as described&#xD;
      below:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Surgery Group: Fourteen patients who meet study criteria will be assigned to the study&#xD;
           group and will undergo surgery; 7 RYGB and 7 SG, as planned for their standard care.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Lifestyle Intervention Group: Fourteen patients matched to the surgery group for age,&#xD;
           gender, BMI, diabetes status, and NAFLD score will undergo additional lifestyle&#xD;
           interventions, dietary counselling (either a meal replacement diet or a low calorie&#xD;
           diet) by a dietician aimed at inducing at least a 5-7% weight reduction, prior to their&#xD;
           surgery (while on the waiting list for surgery).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each participant in both the surgery and lifestyle intervention group will then attend the&#xD;
      baseline visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the baseline visit the participant will undergo a metabolic lab panel from bloods already&#xD;
      provided to the clinic. This visit will also involve the clinical team performing an&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (FNA) of the liver. The fine needle aspiration will&#xD;
      involve inserting a small needle through the skin to take a small sample of cells from the&#xD;
      liver. It will be carried out in the Institute of Liver Studies at King's College Hospital.&#xD;
      The clinical research team will also access the participants medical record to collect data&#xD;
      from your medical history including weight, height, body mass index (BMI) and previous&#xD;
      FibroScan®. Additionally, a saliva swab, urine and stool sample will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A subgroup of patients (6 participants in the Lifestyle Intervention Group, 6 undergoing&#xD;
      RYGB, 6 undergoing SG) will undergo a mixed meal test (MMT) to investigate changes in&#xD;
      meal-response of circulating cardiometabolic markers, bile acids and gut hormone as well as&#xD;
      calculated insulin sensitivity/secretion. The surgery group patients will undergo surgery as&#xD;
      per standard practice and will be reviewed in the bariatric clinic 4-6 weeks' post surgery-&#xD;
      this will be at 5-7% weight loss (WL). At the 5-7% WL visit the patient will undergo a&#xD;
      metabolic lab panel, a liver FNA, will have their weight and height recorded and BMI&#xD;
      calculated. A new FibroScan will be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Additionally, a saliva swab, urine and stool sample will be collected. The 12 patients ( 6&#xD;
      RYGB, 6 SG) in the surgery group who were included in the previous MMT will undergo a second&#xD;
      MMT to investigate the change in meal-response of circulating cardio-metabolic markers, bile&#xD;
      acids, gut hormones, insulin sensitivity/secretion post-surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The lifestyle intervention group participants will attend a one-to-one dietary consultation&#xD;
      with a registered dietician to select a diet plan: either a low-calorie diet or meal&#xD;
      replacement diet to induce 5-7% WL. Information booklets that will aid dieting will be&#xD;
      provided to the participant. The participant will then be expected to follow the dietary&#xD;
      advice in order to achieve a 5-7% WL. The clinical research team will provide additional&#xD;
      phone call consultations at 2-, 4-, 8-, 12-, 14-, 16-, 18-, 20-, 22-, 24-weeks post-lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention to assess weight change, diet adherence and motivation. Once the participant has&#xD;
      a 5-7% WL they will attend the bariatric clinic for their 5-7% WL visit. At the 5-7% WL visit&#xD;
      the patient will undergo a metabolic lab panel, a liver FNA, will have their weight and&#xD;
      height recorded and BMI calculated. A new FibroScan will be performed. Additionally, a saliva&#xD;
      swab, urine and stool sample will be collected. The 6 patients in the lifestyle intervention&#xD;
      group who were included in the previous MMT will undergo a second MMT to investigate the&#xD;
      change in meal-response of circulating cardio-metabolic markers, bile acids, gut hormones,&#xD;
      insulin sensitivity/secretion post-lifestyle intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The outcome measures above will be measured at two time-points; baseline and after 5-7%&#xD;
      weight loss in both groups. The study design allows to control for weight loss (through an&#xD;
      equivalent weight loss of 5-7% between the two groups) and to understand the effects&#xD;
      bariatric/metabolic surgery versus lifestyle intervention (diet and exercise), by mechanisms&#xD;
      independent of weight-loss, on markers of NASH and cardiovascular risk, therefore allowing to&#xD;
      identify weight-independent effects of bariatric/metabolic surgery, if they exist. Based on&#xD;
      published data it is predicted that it will take 3-6 months for patients to achieve 5-7%&#xD;
      weight loss (WL) from the lifestyle intervention used in this study and 4-6 weeks after&#xD;
      surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adipose and liver tissue from intraoperative biopsies and gastric and intestinal tissue from&#xD;
      surgical waste will be collected and stored for future ethically approved research.&#xD;
