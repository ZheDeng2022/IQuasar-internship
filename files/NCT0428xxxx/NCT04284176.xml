  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with cerebral palsy hemiplegia present a restriction in the daily activities due to&#xD;
      the limitation in the active movement of the affected upper extremity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mirror therapy (MT) in children with hemiparesis produces an improvement in the quality&#xD;
      of movement and in the perception of the affected upper extremity. The action-observation&#xD;
      therapy (AOT) favors the motor behaviour of the affected upper extremity through the&#xD;
      observation of sequences of systematic activities and their posterior execution. It also&#xD;
      produces an increase in the excitability of the corticospinal tract, originating muscular&#xD;
      pattern contraction similar to the observed ones and favoring the motor activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The combination of both therapies might improve the quality of movement of the upper&#xD;
      extremity and provide a major cortical activation and increase the spontaneous use on having&#xD;
      created the only protocol of intervention which includes the benefits of both interventions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal aim of this study is to analyze the influence of the quality of movement in the&#xD;
      spontaneous use of the upper extremity affected in children with hemiparesis as well as the&#xD;
      improvement of both variables across MTAO. Another specific aim will be to determine if &quot;the&#xD;
      non-use&quot; is determined by the quality of the movement of the segment, if the MTAO reduces&#xD;
      &quot;the non-use&quot; of this extremity as well as to obtain a protocol of intervention that&#xD;
      increases the quality of movement and the spontaneous long-term use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A randomized controlled trial will be carry out in children with hemiparesia between 6 and 12&#xD;
      years, with a spontaneous use of the hand according to the scale HOUSE, a level Manual&#xD;
      Ability Classification System (MASC) I-III and a good cooperation and cognition. Those with a&#xD;
      severe spasticity, previous surgery of the upper extremity and the use of botox will be&#xD;
      excluded. The children will be divided in two groups. The experimental group will receive for&#xD;
      20 days a daily therapy of 15 minutes at home of MT and 45 of AOT, whereas the control group&#xD;
      will receive 60 minutes of AOT.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Four measurements will be obtained: basal situation, at the end of the treatment and measures&#xD;
      of follow-up to 3 and 6 months after the end of the treatment. Despite the sociodemographic&#xD;
      variables, measures of the quality of the movement, the spontaneous use of the upper&#xD;
      extremity, the questionnaire CHEQ and the AHA scale.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Two protocols are designed to be carried out at home. The AOT protocol includes 15 set of&#xD;
      daily life upper limb uni/bimanual activities (8 sets for bimanual activities and 7 sets for&#xD;
      unimanual activities).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The MTAO group include 6 mirror therapy activities and the same activities that are included&#xD;
      in the AOT protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A pilot study will be conducted for sample size calculation, assessing the AHA and&#xD;
      Jebsen-Taylor scales, before and immediately after the intervention.&#xD;
