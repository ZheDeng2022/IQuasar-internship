      This is a research study in which bio-specimens (whole blood, plasma and serum from&#xD;
      peripheral circulation and portal vein) will be collected from patients with pancreatic&#xD;
      adenocarcinoma for translational research. These samples will be used for (but not limited&#xD;
      to) identification and characterisation of blood-borne biomarkers at the genomic and protein&#xD;
      expression level. Examples of such biomarkers are circulating tumour cells (CTCs), CTC&#xD;
      clusters and circulating DNA (which can be tumour derived, or from unaffected/normal cells).&#xD;
      CTC-enriched blood samples may also be used to generate CTC-derived tumour explant (CDX)&#xD;
      models in immunocompromised mice in order to produce suitable disease models in which to test&#xD;
      novel therapies and identify new molecular targets. In addition, permission will be sought&#xD;
      from study participants for the research team to access clinical information from medical&#xD;
      notes to aid in determining the clinical relevance of biomarkers identified during the course&#xD;
      of this study. Validated biomarkers are anticipated to be used in designing future&#xD;
      biomarker-directed clinical trials in these disease groups.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Pancreatic Ductal Adenocarcinoma (PDAC) presents an urgent medical need. Approximately 9000&#xD;
      new cases of pancreatic cancer are diagnosed every year in the United Kingdom (UK) and&#xD;
      worldwide it is projected to become the second most common cause of cancer related death by&#xD;
      2030. Currently the diagnostic pathway starts with pancreatic protocol Computed Tomgraphy&#xD;
      (CT) scan which demonstrates sensitivity of 90% and specificity of 99% in diagnosis of&#xD;
      pancreatic cancer. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and Positron Emission Tomography (PET)&#xD;
      can assist with ambiguous masses. Despite the high sensitivity and specificity of imaging&#xD;
      modalities, definitive diagnosis is routinely obtained only by endoscopic ultrasound&#xD;
      (EUS)-guided fine-needle aspiration (FNA). During this procedure four &quot;passes&quot; (biopsies) on&#xD;
      average are required to obtain sufficient tissue for diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients usually present with locally advanced or metastatic disease and are offered standard&#xD;
      of care chemotherapy, which has only a limited impact on overall survival. Consequently the&#xD;
      5-year overall survival (OS) is only 2% with no significant improvement over the last 40&#xD;
      years. Approximately only 20% of the patients are eligible for surgical resection which is&#xD;
      followed by adjuvant chemotherapy. However, 66% of these patients will experience local or&#xD;
      distant recurrence, leading to a median overall survival in the range of 28 months. Improved&#xD;
      stratification of patients for existing treatments may thus avoid unnecessary overtreatment&#xD;
      and associated side effects to improve quality of life; conversely, it may also enable&#xD;
      selection for a more appropriate treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A significant reason for the lack of progress in tackling metastatic disease is the poor&#xD;
      understanding of the biology and pathophysiology of metastasis. Studying the biology of PDAC&#xD;
      metastasis is hampered by the fact that it is difficult to obtain tissue from the primary and&#xD;
      metastatic sites. Moreover, serial biopsies following progression during treatment is largely&#xD;
      not feasible, further hindering insight into the mechanisms of development of treatment&#xD;
      resistance. The only easily-accessible blood-borne biomarker that is currently used in clinic&#xD;
      is the serum marker carbohydrate antigen (CA) 19-9. However, its clinical use is limited&#xD;
      firstly by the fact that 5-10% of the population are Lewis blood group negative and do not&#xD;
      express CA19-9. Furthermore it is elevated in non-malignant pancreatic and extra-pancreatic&#xD;
      diseases. Finally, CA19-9 cannot provide information about the genetic landscape that drives&#xD;
      PDAC metastasis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Metastatic spread is primarily haematogenous whereby tumour cells enter the circulation to&#xD;
      metastasize mainly to the liver and lung. Such tumour cells have been shown to travel either&#xD;
      as single circulating tumour cells (CTCs) or as groups of cells termed Circulating Tumour&#xD;
      Microemboli (CTM). Heterogeneous CTM composed of cells expressing either epithellial or&#xD;
      mesenchymal markers were isolated from patients with pancreatic cancer using a&#xD;
      filtration-based method, the Isolation by Size of Epithelial Tumour cells platform (ISET), in&#xD;
      a study performed at the Christie NHS Foundation Trust. As such, isolation and&#xD;
      characterisation of CTCs and CTM will provide new insight into the underlying biological&#xD;
      dependencies of metastasizing tumour cells and may thus provide opportunities to develop&#xD;
      better and more accurate diagnostic and prognostic assays as well as opportunities to treat&#xD;
      metastatic disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Detection and isolation of CTCs and CTM is limited by the fact that they represent very rare&#xD;
      events compared to other cellular elements in the circulation. To this end, methods&#xD;
      exploiting characteristics that differentiate CTCs from blood cells have been developed to&#xD;
      overcome this obstacle. These CTC workflows usually start by enriching CTCs from a blood&#xD;
      sample utilizing either surface markers present exclusively on CTCs, or their unique physical&#xD;
      properties such as size, inertia, dielectric charge and density. Following enrichment, CTCs&#xD;
      are isolated and can be simply enumerated or they are used for more advanced downstream&#xD;
      analysis including genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic analysis as well as in vivo&#xD;
      applications in cell culture and mouse models, with the aim of gaining insight into their&#xD;
      function as metastatic seeds and biomarker development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the clinical setting, CTCs can be used to aid decision making. Indeed, enumeration of CTCs&#xD;
      detected by the CellSearch platform has been FDA approved for prognosis and monitoring of&#xD;
      metastatic breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. However, isolation and enumeration of CTCs&#xD;
      in pancreatic cancer has given inconsistent results between studies as to whether CTCs can be&#xD;
      used as prognostic biomarkers. These studies analysed CTCs isolated from peripheral blood.&#xD;
      However, as the main venous drainage of the pancreas is through the portal vein to the liver,&#xD;
      it may be hypothesized that CTCs could be filtered and removed as they pass through the liver&#xD;
      capillaries. Hence, in order to define the biological and prognostic role of CTCs in&#xD;
      pancreatic adenocarcinoma, it is critical to initiate studies with blood isolated from the&#xD;
      portal vein to bypass confounding effects. Indeed, detection of CTCs in portal vein (PV)&#xD;
      blood acquired at operation was recently reported by Bissolati et al.. By obtaining&#xD;
      peripheral vein samples at the same time, this study confirmed that CTC number was greater in&#xD;
      portal compared to peripheral samples and also demonstrated significant correlation between&#xD;
      CTC positivity in portal vein samples and frequency on liver metastasis. However, it failed&#xD;
      to show significant correlation with OS or Disease Free Survival (DFS). PV sampling has been&#xD;
      performed safely; in December 2015 Catenacci et al. reported collection of PV blood from 18&#xD;
      patients with pancreatobilliary cancers by EUS-FNA with no complications during the&#xD;
      procedure. PV puncture has also been previously reported for islet cell transplantation in&#xD;
      patients with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus. This procedure has low morbidity and also, potential&#xD;
      complications, such as portal vein thrombosis, perihepatic or intraparenchymal hepatic&#xD;
      haemorrhage and haemothorax are reported at a low rate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During EUS-FNA a curvilinear echoendoscope is advanced to the distal stomach or duodenal bulb&#xD;
      to provide a window of access to a branch of the PV. After verifying venous flow by Doppler&#xD;
      signal, a 19-gauge EUS-FNA needle is advanced transhepatically into the portal vein branch.&#xD;
      With the needle in the portal vein, the stylet is removed and negative-pressure suction is&#xD;
      applied to aspirate blood. A transhepatic approach for portal vein branch access is an&#xD;
      absolute requirement of this technique in order to minimize the risk of bleeding. The&#xD;
      puncture site is monitored under EUS for complications. As tumour tissue will be obtained at&#xD;
      the same time, a potential risk is the introduction of cancer cells into the circulation as&#xD;
      the needle is withdrawn from the tumour. This risk however is circumvented as the route of&#xD;
      the needle into the portal vein would avoid the primary mass.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary reason for drug failure in PDAC is the failure to identify predictive biomarkers&#xD;
      for treatment response which would allow enrichment of patient sub-groups most likely to&#xD;
      benefit from an individual therapy. This is in contrast to other major cancer types, in which&#xD;
      advances in development of new cancer therapeutics and resulting improvement in survival&#xD;
      outcomes are mainly due to the use of predictive biomarkers to select patients who will&#xD;
      derive differential benefit from a particular therapeutic agent. Trastuzumab in breast&#xD;
      cancers over-expressing HER-2, cetuximab for KRAS wild-type colorectal cancer, and gefitinib&#xD;
      and erlotinib for Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor (EGFR) mutant non-small cell lung cancer&#xD;
      best exemplify this therapeutic paradigm. By providing greater numbers of CTCs and CTM,&#xD;
      analysis of PV sample will enable studies of their biology as well as development of cell&#xD;
      lines and CDX models to allow identification of novel biomarkers and targets for new&#xD;
      treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering current gaps in knowledge of tumour biology of PDAC and the lack of progress in&#xD;
      therapeutics, there is an urgent clinical need to develop a research strategy that will allow&#xD;
      the discovery and validation of new biomarkers in this group of patients, and inform on&#xD;
      biomarker-directed clinical trials to ultimately improve survival. To initiate such a&#xD;
      research strategy, there is a need for systematic, prospective collection and analysis of&#xD;
      blood samples acquired from peripheral and portal vein circulation to identify blood-borne&#xD;
      surrogate tumour markers that will enable physicians to obtain relevant information for&#xD;
      making personalised therapeutic decisions, in a minimally-invasive way.&#xD;
