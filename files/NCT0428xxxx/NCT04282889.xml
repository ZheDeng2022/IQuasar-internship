  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Background: Rotational thromboelastometry (ROTEM) has been used widely in liver&#xD;
      transplantation for coagulation management. However, a TRUE-NATEM (TRUE-Non-Activated&#xD;
      Rotational Thromboelastometry) reference value has never been established. A TRUE-NATEM value&#xD;
      is of clinical significance since no coagulation activators or reagents will be added to the&#xD;
      blood sample for analysis. Therefore, the result will reflect the true coagulation profile of&#xD;
      the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: Non-citrated whole blood will be used for analysis. Blood will be drawn from the&#xD;
      patient and transferred into a plastic reagent cup that has no reagent. Test will be&#xD;
      performed within 4 minutes of blood draw to avoid activation of coagulation. Primary outcome&#xD;
      measure will be clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT) and maximum clot firmness&#xD;
      (MCF). The specific aims of the study are to establish a TRUE-NATEM reference value using&#xD;
      Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) in patients undergoing liver transplantation. Our&#xD;
      hypothesis is that clotting time (CT), clot formation time (CFT) is prolonged and maximum&#xD;
      clot firmness (MCF) decreased compared to healthy volunteers in patient undergoing liver&#xD;
      transplantation due to synthetic coagulation factor deficiency.&#xD;

      This study is a prospective cohort study establishing a TRUE-NATEM reference value using&#xD;
      Rotational Thromboelastometry (ROTEM®) in patients undergoing liver transplantation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study population will include 20 adults (age range of 18 - 75 years) who are undergoing&#xD;
      liver transplantation. Inclusion criteria are patients undergoing liver transplantation with&#xD;
      English as their native language.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria include patient's refusal, or on medical anticoagulation therapy. Informed&#xD;
      consents will be obtained from the patients who agree to participate in this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Currently, all patients undergoing liver transplantation will have hourly ROTEM analysis as&#xD;
      standard of care. An additional TRUE-NATEM test will be performed after induction if&#xD;
      anesthesia. 5 mL of whole blood will be obtained via a preexisting peripheral IV catheter or&#xD;
      arterial line using a sterile technique. The blood will be transferred into a plastic reagent&#xD;
      cup that has no additives. Test will be performed within 4 minutes of blood draw.3 All&#xD;
      patients will undergo the standard anesthesia care and intraoperative coagulation monitoring&#xD;
      and blood transfusion will be carried out using the standard practice guideline of the TJUH.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The control population will include 20 adult volunteers (age 18-65 years) who meet the in the&#xD;
      American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) Physical Status (PS) Classes 1 criteria.&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria will be refusal, volunteers on any medication or significant history of&#xD;
      bleeding.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the control group 5 mL of whole blood will be obtained after placing a peripheral IV&#xD;
      catheter using a sterile technique. Blood draw from steel needle will be avoided because&#xD;
      steel will activate coagulation. The blood will be transferred into a plastic reagent cup&#xD;
      that has no additives. Test will be performed within 4 minutes of blood draw.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For each patient and control group four channels of ROTEM (TRUE-NATEM, NATEM, INTEM, EXTEM,)&#xD;
      will be performed following the standard guideline at the Anesthesiology Coagulation&#xD;
      Laboratory by a certified ROTEM specialists. Primary outcome measure will be clotting time&#xD;
      (CT), clot formation time (CFT) and maximum clot firmness (MCF). The following demographic&#xD;
      information will be collected; ASA physical status, age, height, weight, gender, home&#xD;
      medication use, past medical history, and past surgical history.&#xD;
