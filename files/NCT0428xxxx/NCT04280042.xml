  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a condition detected as an irregular heartbeat. It is the most&#xD;
      common rhythm disturbance worldwide which can lead to significant symptoms and serious health&#xD;
      problems (stroke and heart failure). The longer a person has AF, the more difficult it is to&#xD;
      restore a normal heart rhythm. Those with continuous AF for longer than a year are described&#xD;
      as having longstanding persistent AF (LSPAF). This is the most challenging type of AF to&#xD;
      treat and medications are often not effective. Apart from medications patients with LSPAF may&#xD;
      be offered a medical procedure to help improve their symptoms. It involves putting a flexible&#xD;
      thin tube (catheter) into a blood vessel in the groin and up into the heart to destroy the&#xD;
      tissue causing irregular heart beat. This procedure has modest success in improving symptoms&#xD;
      in the long term. Recently, keyhole surgery has been used for these patients and evidence&#xD;
      shows that it is better than the catheter procedure. However, we do not know how well people&#xD;
      are doing beyond one year. Feedback from a patient focus group suggested that knowing the&#xD;
      long-term results of these two procedures is important to help them make an informed choice&#xD;
      when it comes to treatment. In this study we propose to continue monitoring patients from a&#xD;
      randomised clinical trial (CASA AF RCT) who have already had one of the procedures. They have&#xD;
      a small heartbeat monitor implanted under the skin with a battery life of around 3 years. We&#xD;
      will be able to look at their heart rhythm data for the duration of this period and detect&#xD;
      the return of the fibrillation if it happens.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study involves participants from the randomised clinical trial which was just completed&#xD;
      (CASA AF RCT: NCT02755688; ISRCTN18250790 ). They have undergone relevant ablation procedures&#xD;
      in a randomised fashion and completed 12 months follow up. At the last study visit they&#xD;
      signed a consent form to confirm that they have agreed to keep implanted loop recorder for&#xD;
      the duration of its battery life time (approximately 3 years). They have also continued to&#xD;
      regularly transfer data from their implanted loop recorder to the secure server where it is&#xD;
      regularly reviewed. This group of patients is now a unique cohort whose follow up data is&#xD;
      invaluable for additional research. For this study we will ask for their written consent and&#xD;
      apart from analysing their heart rhythm data we will arrange two hospital visits with some&#xD;
      additional tests and completion of questionnaires.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The principal objective of the study is to compare the long-term effectiveness of&#xD;
      thoracoscopic surgical ablation and percutaneous catheter ablation, the two procedures&#xD;
      available for treatment of atrial fibrillation in patients with longstanding persistent AF&#xD;
      (LSPAF). There is some evidence that thoracoscopic surgical ablation may be better than&#xD;
      catheter ablation in keeping the patients in regular heart rhythm after a single procedure&#xD;
      without use of antiarrhythmic drugs in short term. In this study we plan to monitor patients&#xD;
      who have undergone these procedures for 3 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our secondary objectives are focussing on patients who had more than one procedure and/or may&#xD;
      be using medications in order to maintain regular heart rhythm during 36 months follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      We will therefore look at:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the effectiveness of a single procedure (catheter or surgical) in maintaining normal&#xD;
           rhythm with use of antiarrhythmic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the effectiveness of multiple ablative procedures in maintaining sinus rhythm with and&#xD;
           without use of antiarrhythmic drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. the proportion of patients who are still in AF but the time they spend in it is reduced&#xD;
           by ≥75%.&#xD;
&#xD;
           We will also want to examine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. patient reported change in quality of life from baseline to 24 and 36 months after&#xD;
           ablative treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. changes in levels of serum biomarkers from baseline to 36 months and how they relate to&#xD;
           the freedom of arrhythmia&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. health and social care resource use and associated costs from baseline to 36 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. the cost-effectiveness of thoracoscopic surgical ablation compared with catheter&#xD;
           ablation and update the health economic model developed for the main study (CASA AF&#xD;
           RCT).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our sample size calculations show that with an expected rate of attrition of around 20% we&#xD;
      need 94-100 study participants to show the difference in the effectiveness of the two&#xD;
      procedure with power of 80%, p= 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients participating in this extended follow-up study will attend two hospital appointments&#xD;
      to coincide with 24 and 36 months post-ablation (± 6 months). These two visits will consist&#xD;
      of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. clinical examination&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. review of concurrent medications and comorbidities&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. electrocardiogram (12 lead ECG )&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. blood test for routine biochemistry and collection of a sample for biomarkers analyses&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. completion of questionnaires to assess patients' quality of life: atrial fibrillation&#xD;
           effect on quality of life (AFEQT), EuroQol (EQ5D5L) European Heart Rhythm Association&#xD;
           score of atrial fibrillation (EHRA),&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Health economic questionnaire to capture repeat procedures (ablation, direct current&#xD;
           cardioversion and AF-related emergency care)&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the duration of the extended follow-up, once a week patients will download data from&#xD;
      their implantable loop recorders which have algorithms that are specific for atrial&#xD;
      arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, atrial tachycardia, atrial flutter). Patients remotely&#xD;
      download their data to the Medtronic (MyCarelinkTM) secure server. These data will be&#xD;
      reviewed centrally every month by a dedicated Research Fellow. Patients will be contacted&#xD;
      monthly by telephone to ensure compliance and to discuss any rhythm abnormalities detected in&#xD;
      these data that require review of treatment/ management. Patients will be able to contact the&#xD;
      research team if they experience symptoms of atrial arrhythmias. The implanted loop recorder&#xD;
      data can be interrogated remotely, and appropriate advice regarding treatment given based on&#xD;
      data review.&#xD;
