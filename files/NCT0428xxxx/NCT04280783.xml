  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Barriers to physical activity (PA) among African Americans (AAs) have been extensively&#xD;
      studied, yet there is a paucity of innovative PA interventions designed to address them. In&#xD;
      recent years, many studies have used the internet to promote PA in many settings, including&#xD;
      the home environment, but only a few studies have recruited AAs. Without innovative and&#xD;
      culturally relevant interventions, AAs will continue reporting extremely low levels of PA and&#xD;
      disparate cardiovascular health outcomes. In prior work, the investigators sought the input&#xD;
      of AA focus groups to inform the development of a technology-based Physical Activity for The&#xD;
      Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to&#xD;
      promote PA in any setting. The investigators designed PATH as a culturally salient&#xD;
      action-oriented intervention that can be accessed in any setting to promote PA among inactive&#xD;
      AAs. In this application, the investigators propose to examine whether PATH is a feasible&#xD;
      strategy for promoting PA among inactive AAs. In Aim 1 the investigators will conduct a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial that will include 30 inactive AAs to assess the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of the PATH intervention. In Aim 2 the investigators will examine the trend in&#xD;
      PA and cardiovascular disease risk change from baseline to post-intervention. This approach&#xD;
      is innovative because it leverages openly accessible technologies to provide a wide variety&#xD;
      of free, enjoyable and action-oriented workout videos that match AAs preferences. This&#xD;
      contribution will be significant because PATH could offer a novel, low-cost, and scalable&#xD;
      strategy for promoting PA among individuals facing socio-environmental barriers to PA.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Whereas an inverse dose-response relationship has been established between physical activity&#xD;
      (PA) and a host of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease (CVD), most American&#xD;
      adults (79%) are physically inactive and do not attain the minimum PA levels recommended by&#xD;
      the PA Guidelines for Americans. African Americans (AAs) in particular report very low levels&#xD;
      of PA, and have the highest burden of CVD in the United States.To eliminate the prevailing&#xD;
      cardiovascular health disparities, there is a critical need for pragmatic and culturally&#xD;
      salient interventions that are designed to address barriers to PA that are more problematic&#xD;
      for AAs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Common barriers to PA such as lack of time and low exercise self-efficacy are pervasive in&#xD;
      all racial groups. In addition to these barriers, socio-environmental factors, such as unsafe&#xD;
      neighborhoods and limited access to fitness facilities play a key role in perpetuating the&#xD;
      low levels of PA observed in AAs. To mitigate these barriers, home-based PA interventions&#xD;
      delivered via mail, telephone and internet have been developed. Although only a few of these&#xD;
      interventions have been tested among AAs, preliminary studies have reported more&#xD;
      participation and retention of AAs in home-based PA programs. However, the associated PA&#xD;
      outcomes have been minimal, especially in less educated AAs. Low literacy levels and reliance&#xD;
      on print-based resources with no cultural appeal are thought to limit the utility of the&#xD;
      interventions in AAs. The investigators have previously reported how AAs prefer PA programs&#xD;
      that are visual, convenient, fun to engage in, and feature people they can relate to&#xD;
      especially in body size, fitness status and age. Other studies have reported similar&#xD;
      preferences for PA among AAs, yet there is a paucity of PA interventions that are designed to&#xD;
      incorporate these preferences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To bridge this gap, the investigators have developed a web-based Physical Activity for The&#xD;
      Heart (PATH) intervention that leverages openly accessible platforms, such as YouTube, to&#xD;
      proffer workout videos that match the reported preferences. Currently, PATH includes 90&#xD;
      workout videos vetted using the FITT principle (frequency, intensity, time, type) and curated&#xD;
      on the PATH website in 3 controlled levels of intensity (beginner, intermediate, proficient)&#xD;
      to foster gradual progression from low to high intensity PA. The overarching aim of the&#xD;
      proposed study is to conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) to assess the&#xD;
      feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention for promoting PA in AAs. The&#xD;
      investigators will enroll 30 inactive AAs and randomize them to either treatment (12-wks of&#xD;
      PATH) or wait-list control (use a general health handout) group to address the following&#xD;
      specific aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 1: Assess the feasibility and acceptability of the PATH intervention among inactive AAs.&#xD;
      Feasibility will be assessed via 1) number of participants screened for eligibility; 2)&#xD;
      percentage eligible; 3) percentage enrolled; 4) percentage retained within each randomized&#xD;
      group; and 5) adherence to self-monitoring (Actigraph wear time) and intervention protocol&#xD;
      (PATH utilization). Acceptability will be evaluated via a post-intervention survey developed&#xD;
      by the study team to appraise the intervention's usability and perceived efficacy for&#xD;
      increasing PA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim 2: Describe the trends in PA and CVD risk change from baseline to post-intervention. The&#xD;
      primary outcome will be PA and will include objectively measured steps, light PA, and&#xD;
      moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA). Cardiovascular outcomes will include blood pressure (BP),&#xD;
      body fat percentage, body mass index (BMI), glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) and lipids (LDL, HDL,&#xD;
      and total cholesterol). Trends will be summarized as mean within-group changes (with 95%&#xD;
      confidence intervals [CIs]).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The proposed research addresses a key driver of cardiovascular health disparities and is&#xD;
      innovative in its rigorous testing of the novel PATH intervention for feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability among inactive AAs. Findings from this study will inform the refinement of the&#xD;
      PATH intervention to be tested in a full-scale RCT.&#xD;
