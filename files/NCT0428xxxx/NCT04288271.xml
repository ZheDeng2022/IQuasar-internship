  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Medication non-adherence is a major problem in kidney transplant recipients; young people&#xD;
      12-24 years of age are at particularly high risk for non-adherence and graft failure compared&#xD;
      to young children and adults. Given that poor medication contributes greatly to graft&#xD;
      failure, clinically feasible and effective interventions are urgently needed to improve&#xD;
      adherence, survival, and quality of life in this population. The broad aim of this&#xD;
      prospective, 3-stage, sequential study is to improve medication adherence in adolescent&#xD;
      kidney transplant recipients by: 1) adapting the successful Teen Adherence in Kidney&#xD;
      transplant Effectiveness of Intervention Trial (TAKE-IT) intervention for use in 'real world'&#xD;
      clinical care, 2) designing and testing a new portable electronic pillbox and companion&#xD;
      tracking website interface, and 3) preliminary testing of the adapted intervention.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This entry describes Stage 3 of the study. In Stage 3, the adapted intervention and new&#xD;
      e-pillbox and adherence-tracking website will be piloted in preparation for a definitive&#xD;
      cluster-randomized trial (CRT). This study builds on the lessons from TAKE-IT and is a&#xD;
      critical step towards a scalable intervention for real-world use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stage 3 aims to pilot the adapted intervention, including the new e-pillbox, in a CRT to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Determine the feasibility of a full-scale CRT (process considerations, attrition)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Understand all stakeholders' experience with the intervention, including the degree to&#xD;
           which the e-pillbox and adherence-tracking website are integrated into daily life by&#xD;
           patients and into practice by HCP&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Estimate intra-cluster correlation coefficients (ICC) and other statistical parameters&#xD;
           related to adherence outcomes relevant for sample size planning for a CRT. Adherence&#xD;
           outcomes to be considered include daily proportion of patients with 100% taking&#xD;
           adherence (defined as having taken all prescribed doses in a day) and daily proportion&#xD;
           of patients with correct dosing (defined as having taken all prescribed doses within 2&#xD;
           hours before or after the scheduled time).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The adapted adherence-promoting intervention will be compared with another intervention in a&#xD;
      pilot parallel-groups CRT. The interventions will be applied over 10 weeks. Participating&#xD;
      centers, rather than patients, were randomized using a restricted randomization strategy with&#xD;
      the Montreal Children's Hospital (MCH) assigned to the adherence intervention. This is&#xD;
      necessary to ensure that the PI and lead site get sufficient experience with the intervention&#xD;
      to guide other sites and to prepare for the full-scale CRT. All other sites were randomized,&#xD;
      stratified on center size, to the new adherence intervention or the healthy living education&#xD;
      intervention (control arm); this ensured adequate numbers of participants in each arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to enroll 67 patients across all sites over a 6-month interval. Based on numbers&#xD;
      of available patients at each site, the targets noted above represent 13-50% of eligible&#xD;
      patients at a given site. Allowing for 10% drop-out, 60 will complete the study (TAKE-IT had&#xD;
      4% drop-out by 6 mo.). HCP at each site will also be enrolled (the 2-3 HCP most involved with&#xD;
      direct patient care) to allow capture of information on their experience with the e-pillbox&#xD;
      system and intervention over the course of the study. Participants will be blinded to group&#xD;
      allocation but, given the nature of the intervention, coaches must be aware of group&#xD;
      allocation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrollment will be followed by a 4-week run-in period during which adherence will be&#xD;
      monitored electronically, but no intervention will be applied. This will give participants&#xD;
      time to become familiar with the e-pillbox and provide pre-intervention adherence data. All&#xD;
      participants will receive a text message from study staff 1 week after initiation of the&#xD;
      run-in to check-in on how they are doing with the e-pillbox. If a participant is experiencing&#xD;
      difficulties, staff will offer assistance by phone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The first intervention will occur at 4 weeks (+/- 1 wk.). At this visit, participants will&#xD;
      meet via video conferencing (or in person, if possible) with the coach. Participants at&#xD;
      adherence intervention sites will begin the adherence-promoting intervention, including&#xD;
      activation of dose reminders from the e-pillbox (as desired) and access to the&#xD;
      adherence-tracking website. Participants at healthy living education intervention sites will&#xD;
      begin the healthy living intervention, but will have no dose reminders from the e-pillbox and&#xD;
      will not have access to the adherence-tracking website during the intervention interval. The&#xD;
      healthcare team will provide the usual level of care to all participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 10-week intervention interval, participants at healthy living education&#xD;
      sites will be offered extended use of the e-pillbox, with dose reminders enabled, and access&#xD;
      for themselves and their HCP to the adherence-tracking website for an additional 8 weeks.&#xD;
      This will serve to encourage participation and use of the e-pillbox at healthy living&#xD;
      education sites, and will allow estimation of the degree to which the adherence-tracking&#xD;
      website is integrated into practice by HCP without support from a coach, as well as providing&#xD;
      a sense of the impact of usual care plus dose reminders and possible feedback from HCP on&#xD;
      adherence. This period of extended use will also allow patients at healthy living&#xD;
      intervention sites the opportunity to benefit from the e-pillbox component of the&#xD;
      intervention, and to be able to express their opinions about all the functionalities of the&#xD;
      e-pillbox.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have virtual (or phone) contact with coaches at increasing intervals&#xD;
      between initiation of the intervention at week 4 and exit at week 14. The first check-in will&#xD;
      occur at week 6 (+/- 1 wk), 2 weeks after initiation of the adherence-promoting intervention,&#xD;
      the second will occur at week 10 (+/- 1 wk). This will allow intervals of increasing&#xD;
      frequency between contacts as participants become more comfortable with procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCP participants at adherence intervention sites will be trained to use the&#xD;
      adherence-tracking website within 2 weeks before to 1 week after the first patient at their&#xD;
      site completes the 4-week visit. HCP participants will be given access to the adherence data&#xD;
      of all patient participants at their coaching site and invited to consult the website as&#xD;
      often as they wish. HCP participants will also be shown a short (5 min) video providing&#xD;
      education on assessing and supporting adherence.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCP participants at healthy living education sites will be trained to use the&#xD;
      adherence-tracking website within 2 weeks before to 1 week after the first patient at their&#xD;
      site completes the 14-week visit. HCP participants will be given access to the adherence data&#xD;
      of all patient participants at their healthy living education site and invited to consult the&#xD;
      website as often as they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      HCP participants at all sites will be advised that they will be informed by study staff about&#xD;
      critical non-adherence events among participants. At adherence intervention sites, alerts&#xD;
      regarding critical non-adherence events will be activated during the interval between 4 and&#xD;
      14 weeks; at healthy living education sites, alerts will be activated during the interval&#xD;
      between 14 and 22 weeks. Alerts will be sent to study staff, who will then follow-up with the&#xD;
      patient and advise the HCP of the particular issue. HCP will be advised that they will be&#xD;
      under no obligation to act on the information in alerts, but may if they wish.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within 2 weeks after the last patient at the site completes the 14-week visit at adherence&#xD;
      intervention sites and within 2 weeks after the last patient at the site completes the&#xD;
      22-week visit at healthy living education sites, HCP participants will complete&#xD;
      questionnaires on their experience using the fully-functional e-pillbox (including the&#xD;
      Post-Study System Usability Questionnaire (PSSUQ) focused on the adherence-tracking website).&#xD;

    <description>The objective of the intervention is to improve medication adherence. Patient-participants will use a multi-dose electronic pillbox and adherence tracking website which can provide dose reminders. Patient will form an Adherence Support Team (AST) including the participant, a parent (or other) and the &quot;Coach&quot; (study coordinator). The Coach will guide the AST to use Action-focused Problem-solving to address personal barriers to adherence. They will then generate concrete &quot;if-then&quot; plans for how they will behave in a given situation. Intervention participants with excellent adherence will be encouraged to work on building autonomy in medication-taking instead of adherence. Action plans will be able to be modified, if desired, at the 6-week and 10-week check-ins.&#xD;
HCP-participants at intervention sites will be given the option to login to the adherence tracking website to view the adherence data of their patients. They will also be alerted by study staff to critical non-adherence events.</description>

    <description>Patient-participants will receive a healthy living education intervention with the use of an e-pillbox. Contacts with the coach will occur at the same intervals as at adherence intervention sites. Participants will choose one of 3 healthy living topics on which they will receive education in an interactive format. The coach will engage the participant in a semi-scripted conversation on the selected topic. At check-ins, the coach will either continue the conversation on the topic selected at the outset or provide education on another topic. The coach will NOT engage in discussions about adherence and will NOT provide feedback on adherence data.&#xD;
At the end of the healthy living intervention at 14W, patient-participants at will be offered extended use of the e-pillbox, with dose reminders enabled and access for themselves and enrolled HCPs to the adherence-tracking website for an additional 8 weeks. They will not receive coaching during this period.</description>

    <ipd_description>Data generated will be available for use to other investigators in the research community. Data may be used for hypothesis testing, and to generate preliminary data in support of future research projects. A Data Sharing Committee, composed site investigators will review requests submitted for use of the data. If the request is approved, the appropriate data analysis will be performed and the results sent to the requesting investigator. Alternatively, depending on the request, it may be more appropriate to provide the requesting investigator with certain segments of the data. If this is the case, a file of the requested data (de-identified) will be provided to the investigator</ipd_description>
