    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1b open-label study of ciforadenant, an oral, small molecule inhibitor&#xD;
      targeting adenosine-2A receptors (A2AR), on safety/tolerability and efficacy in combination&#xD;
      with daratumumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CD38, in relapsed or refractory multiple&#xD;
      myeloma.&#xD;
