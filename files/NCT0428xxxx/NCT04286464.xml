    <textblock>
      This study collects data on microbiological, genetic and environmental factors, as well as&#xD;
      lung function parameters (e.g. spirometry, body plethysmography, lung-MRI) to assess the&#xD;
      complex interaction of predisposing risk factors for impaired lung development and&#xD;
      respiratory diseases.&#xD;

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Lung development and growth is a complexly orchestrated process starting prenatally in the&#xD;
      first embryonic weeks, and ending, with the last important stages of alveolarization from the&#xD;
      24th week onwards. By the time of birth, around one third of the total amount of alveoli has&#xD;
      developed, while the rest develops during infancy and childhood. After birth, lung volume,&#xD;
      airways and the gas-exchanging surface increase by a multiple, reaching the maximum lung size&#xD;
      at around 25 years of age. A comprehensive understanding of lung growth and development is&#xD;
      crucial in order to understand the pathophysiology of lung diseases. During childhood and&#xD;
      ongoing lung growth, an important amount of respiratory diseases might develop.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Longitudinal assessment of lung growth and development, to examine respiratory morbidity such&#xD;
      as Asthma and allergy, and the complex relationship between associated Risk factors mainly&#xD;
      genetic predisposition and environmental factors on both lung development and subsequent&#xD;
      respiratory morbidity, Therefore, longitudinal data on lung function and structure, on&#xD;
      respiratory morbidity and on genetic, immunological, microbiological and environmental risk&#xD;
      factors will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment and participation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited antenatal through advertisement placed at gynaecological&#xD;
      Hospital in Bern and by obstetricians or midwives. Interested participants can get further&#xD;
      information about the study by telephone from study nurses, as well as during the baseline&#xD;
      visit at the University Children's Hospital in Bern, respectively. Mothers with a high risk&#xD;
      of a preterm delivery will be informed by clinical Investigators at the Department of&#xD;
      Obstetrics of the University Hospital Bern. Preterm infants, which receive ventilatory&#xD;
      support over a long period are at Risk for chronical lung diseases in early childhood, named&#xD;
      bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). The recruitment of this infants will take place at the&#xD;
      neonatology intensive care unit by clinical Investigators. On average 40 healthy children, 40&#xD;
      preterm children and 20 infants from risk pregnancies will be recruited as participants of&#xD;
      the BILD cohort each year for Study Phase I. At 3, 6, 9, 12, 15 years and once after the 16th&#xD;
      year of age the parents/participants will be asked again, if they would like to participate&#xD;
      at the follow-up visits at the University Children's Hospital in Bern for the subsequent&#xD;
      Study Phases II and III.&#xD;
