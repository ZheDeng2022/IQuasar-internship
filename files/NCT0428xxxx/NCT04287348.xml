      The purpose of this investigator initiated study is to identify the effects of intravitreal&#xD;
      brolucizumab on recurrence-free treatment intervals and morphological features in choroidal&#xD;
      neovascularizations (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) in which the Optical&#xD;
      coherence tomography (OCT) guided treatment interval failed to be extended to 6, 8 or 10&#xD;
      weeks intervals in a treat and extend regimen using aflibercept.&#xD;

      Outcome Measures:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary outcome is the mean maximum treatment interval with intravitreal brolucizumab at&#xD;
      month 6 and 12.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary outcomes are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) in letters and BCVA change (letters) from baseline&#xD;

        -  Presence of qualitative SD-OCT features like intraretinal fluid, subretinal fluid,&#xD;
