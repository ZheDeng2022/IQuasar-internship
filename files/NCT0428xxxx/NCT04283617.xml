  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study is designed to test if there is a difference in brain glucose transport kinetics&#xD;
      in poorly controlled T2DM individuals with short duration and long duration of diabetes,&#xD;
      using non-invasive magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRSI). Also, if these changes are&#xD;
      reversible with improved glucose control will be tested. A better understanding of the impact&#xD;
      of duration of diabetes on brain glucose transport function may have important implications&#xD;
      for understanding the pathophysiology of brain complications in T2DM.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Specific Aim 1: To compare brain glucose transport and metabolism in age, BMI, and HbA1c&#xD;
      matched T2DM individuals with either long duration of diabetes or short duration of diabetes&#xD;
      using brain 1H MRSI during hyperglycemic clamp&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: T2DM individuals with chronic uncontrolled diabetes will have lower brain glucose&#xD;
      levels as compared with age, BMI, and HbA1c matched T2DM individuals with shorter duration of&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Screening visit: Volunteers will be screened at the Yale New Haven Hospital (YNHH) Hospital&#xD;
      Research Unit (HRU) or Yale Center for Clinical Investigation (YCCI) Church street Research&#xD;
      Unit (CSRU) with a medical history and exam. Blood tests will be collected for A1C, ALT, TSH,&#xD;
      Hgb and Creatinine. A urine pregnancy test will be performed on all women of childbearing&#xD;
      potential, and women who are pregnant will be excluded.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM): Participants will wear for 14 days prior to the MRSI&#xD;
      scanning sessions a CGM (FreeStyle Libre Pro glucose monitoring system) to continuously&#xD;
      monitor their interstitial blood glucose levels. Given that this data is blinded, patients&#xD;
      will be informed that it is not a replacement for self-monitoring of blood glucose. Subjects&#xD;
      should continue their normal testing routine while wearing the sensor. CGM placement will&#xD;
      take place at the HRU or CSRU. Those not already using CGM in their usual care will be&#xD;
      trained in its proper use by experienced study staff. Patients already using CGM will be&#xD;
      allowed to use their usual CGM, however, they will also be asked to wear a second blinded&#xD;
      study sensor. Subjects will be provided with our contact information in the event that they&#xD;
      have any questions, concerns or issues related to the CGM. Intense exercise may cause the&#xD;
      sensor to loosen due to sweat or movement of the sensor. If the CGM sensor falls off while&#xD;
      the subject is wearing it, subjects will be asked to return to the HRU or CSRU so that a new&#xD;
      sensor can be re-inserted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CGM consists of a sensor that measures glucose levels from the interstitial tissue. The&#xD;
      sensor is sterile and comes in an unopened package. It has a plastic wire-like tip that is&#xD;
      placed under the skin and continuously measures the glucose levels. A trained study staff&#xD;
      member will insert the CGM wirelike tip under the volunteer's skin with the use of the CGM&#xD;
      sensor insertion kit. Each sensor is single use only and disposable. The FreeStyle Libre Pro&#xD;
      does not require any calibration, as is the case with other CGM devices. This means that no&#xD;
      finger sticks are required for its use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      CGM removal: After 14 days of wearing the CGM, it will be removed by a trained study staff&#xD;
      member on the on the same day as the subject's scan. To remove the sensor, the adhesive patch&#xD;
      will be gently peeled off from the skin, together with the sensor. Removal of the sensor is a&#xD;
      painless procedure. The sensor will be discarded after use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      MRSI scanning and Hyperglycemic Clamp: Participants will arrive at MRRC at 7AM on the morning&#xD;
      of the study after an 8 hour overnight fast. A urine pregnancy test will be performed on all&#xD;
      women of childbearing potential, and women who are pregnant will be excluded. Following IV&#xD;
      placements and baseline blood collection, at ~8 AM all T2DM subjects will receive insulin&#xD;
      infusion to keep plasma glucose levels at ~100-110 mg/dl. Once glucose levels are stabilized,&#xD;
      the subjects will be transferred into the 4T scanner for the hyperglycemia clamp.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will lie supine in a 4.0 T whole-body magnet interfaced to a Bruker AVANCE&#xD;
      spectrometer (Bruker Instruments) with the head immobilized with foam inserts on top of a&#xD;
      radiofrequency probe consisting of a 1H coil, as previously described by our group. A nurse&#xD;
      experienced with working in a MRS environment will be with subjects at all times. If patients&#xD;
      express discomfort or anxiety and ask to be removed from the scanner, the session will be&#xD;
      immediately terminated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the 45-minute baseline scan, subjects will remain in the scanner for continuous&#xD;
      scanning during the hyperglycemic clamp. An infusion of 20% dextrose at a variable rate to&#xD;
      maintain plasma glucose levels at 220 mg/dL for 2 hours. Glucose infusion rates will be&#xD;
      adjusted in response to plasma glucose levels measured every 5-10 minutes. Subjects will be&#xD;
      able to take breaks as needed during the 2 hours hyperglycemic clamp and MRS scan. During the&#xD;
      clamp study a series of hormones will be obtained including insulin levels, GLP1, leptin and&#xD;
      free fatty acids.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Neurocognitive testing: Participants will undergo a panel of cognitive testing to assess&#xD;
      working memory, learning and executive function; visual, verbal and episodic memory;&#xD;
      attention, information processing and reaction time; social and emotion recognition, decision&#xD;
      making and response control (CANTAB Cognitive research software, Cambridge Cognition).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: To assess the impact that duration of diabetes has on reversibility of brain&#xD;
      glucose transport kinetics as assessed by 1H MRSI scanning before and after a 12-week&#xD;
      intervention to improve glycemic control&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis: Participants with shorter duration of diabetes (&lt;5 years) will have greater&#xD;
      magnitude of restoration of brain glucose transport parameters compared to T2DM participants&#xD;
      with longer duration of diabetes (&gt;5 years).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects: Subjects from Aim 1 will undergo intensification of their diabetes management for a&#xD;
      period of 12-week and at the end of the intervention they will undergo 1H MRSI scanning to&#xD;
      measure intracerebral and plasma glucose levels at euglycemia and following 2 hours of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia using the clamp technique (target glucose 220 mg/dl) in the occipital region.&#xD;
      (Figure 2)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intensification of insulin regimen/Nutrition visit:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intensification of the diabetes regimens will be managed by Dr. Sanchez Rangel, a fully&#xD;
      trained attending endocrinologist, and will follow the general strategies outlined in the&#xD;
      Position Statement of the American Diabetes Association and the European Association for the&#xD;
      Study of Diabetes. All participants will receive exercise and dietary counseling from Mary&#xD;
      Savoye, a nutritionist and registered dietician with extensive experience with working with&#xD;
      individuals with diabetes and obesity, and who has worked with Dr. Sanchez Rangel on her&#xD;
      current pilot. The weight goal will be to have no more than 5% weight change. Participants&#xD;
      will have regular phone and in-person MD and nutritionist communication over the course of&#xD;
      the 12-week study. All individuals will be asked to perform SMBG at least 4 times a day&#xD;
      (before breakfast, lunch, dinner, and bedtime). The daily SMBG records will be sent to Dr.&#xD;
      Sanchez Rangel weekly for review to guide adjustment of insulin regimens. Target blood&#xD;
      glucose levels will be between 80-130 mg/dl before meals and between &lt; 180 mg/dl at bedtime.&#xD;
      Individuals not at goal glycemic targets will undergo intensification of their regimen.&#xD;
      Throughout the study, individuals will be contacted via telephone call, email or through&#xD;
      additional clinic visits as deemed necessary for maintenance of glycemic control. All&#xD;
      individuals will receive education regarding the detection and proper management of&#xD;
      hypoglycemia.&#xD;
