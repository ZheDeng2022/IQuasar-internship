  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the progress free survival (PFS) of&#xD;
      DCC-2618 in patients with advanced gastrointestinal stromal tumors who have progressed with&#xD;
      prior anticancer therapies based on independent radiologic review.This study will enroll&#xD;
      approximately 35 subjects in up to 10 sites in China mainland, and all subjects will be&#xD;
      receiving DCC-2618 after enrollment as treatment.&#xD;
