      Researchers are trying to determine if heart injury occurs in patients with a cardiac&#xD;
      implantable electronic device (CIED) who undergo a defibrillation threshold testing (DFT)&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      CIED devices that deliver defibrillation can provide life-saving therapy to patients who have&#xD;
      cardiac conditions that make them prone to develop a serious arrhythmia. Currently, there are&#xD;
      two main CIED devices that deliver defibrillation therapy - transvenous internal&#xD;
      cardioverter-defibrillator (ICD) and subcutaneous ICD. Conventional wisdom indicates that&#xD;
      defibrillation causes myocardial injury. However, some studies including one by the present&#xD;
      investigators have reported that external direct current cardioversion does not result in&#xD;
      myocardial injury. There have been studies showing that ICD shocks results in myocardial&#xD;
      injury. The concern with previous studies using transvenous ICDs is that the measurement of&#xD;
      injury was done during DFT testing at the time of ICD implantation or when the patient came&#xD;
      into hospital after an ICD shock. The confounder with DFT testing is that myocardial injury&#xD;
      could have occurred during ICD implantation when the lead is screwed into the myocardium&#xD;
      rather than during the testing. With hospitalization, the precipitating event that caused the&#xD;
      arrhythmia stimulating the ICD discharge (e.g. an acute coronary syndrome) might also be the&#xD;
      cause of myocardial injury. We plan to eliminate these confounders by recruiting patients who&#xD;
      are undergoing a DFT procedure electively, remote from their ICD implantation date or&#xD;
      clinical events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In terms of the subcutaneous ICD implantation (in which the leads are not screwed into the&#xD;
      myocardium), there is little data about myocardial injury when a shock is delivered. The&#xD;
      investigators will attempt to determine if subcutaneous ICD shocks cause myocardial injury by&#xD;
      assessing their troponin levels at the time DFT is performed during implantation.&#xD;
