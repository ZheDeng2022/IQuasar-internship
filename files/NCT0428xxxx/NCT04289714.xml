  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a feasibility study to assess novel electronic monitoring devices for monitoring&#xD;
      adherence in children with asthma who are on inhaled corticosteroids (ICS)&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is a mixed method (quantitative and qualitative) open label, pragmatic randomised&#xD;
      feasibility study with two main aims:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To assess the feasibility of 4 novel electronic monitoring devices in children aged 6-16&#xD;
           years with asthma, in terms of usability and acceptability by patients/ guardians and&#xD;
           healthcare professionals (qualitative study)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the accuracy of these devices and assess whether they impact on asthma&#xD;
           control (quantitative study).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The duration of study is 16 weeks.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This was an open label, block randomised (10 in each block), mixed method (quantitative and&#xD;
      qualitative) study to be conducted for a period of up to 16 weeks&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children aged between 6-16 years with asthma attending the paediatric respiratory difficult&#xD;
      asthma clinic will be recruited into the study and randomly allocated to one of three arms&#xD;
      using block randomisation matched for age and size of group. Children will be assigned to&#xD;
      trial one of the following four NEMD's to be tested:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Block 1 (10): Smart-inhaler Plus™ (Adherium, New Zealand)&#xD;
&#xD;
           • This measures inhalation usually flow sensors and is the next generation of a&#xD;
           currently commercially available EMD&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Block 2a (5) : Flo-Tone (Clement Clarke, UK) plus Rafi-tone, acoustic enabled Smartphone&#xD;
           App (clin-e-cal, UK) for children aged 6 - 11 years • The Flo-Tone attaches to a Metered&#xD;
           Dose Inhaler (MDI) and makes a sound when the inhaler is used correctly. Rafi-tone is a&#xD;
           Smartphone App that detects the sound and activates a game The game is aimed at younger&#xD;
           children and therefore children aged 6 - 11 years will be randomised to this block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block 2b (5) : Inhaler Compliance Assessment (INCA™) device (INCA, Ireland)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  This is an audio recording device which attaches to a Discus dry powder inhaler.&#xD;
           Analysis of the digital audio recordings enables objective assessment of inhaler use and&#xD;
           technique. As it can only be used with a Discus only children ≥ 12 years will be&#xD;
           randomised to this block&#xD;
&#xD;
           3. Block 3: Video and Remote Directly Observed treatment (rDOT)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Children are filmed on a Smartphone using their inhaler. The clip is then automatically&#xD;
           uploaded via a Smartphone App (Continga, UK) and reviewed by a Clinical Nurse Specialist&#xD;
           to ensure inhaler technique is correct.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment :&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim was to recruit 30 children into the study; 10 per block, and 5 per block aged 6-11&#xD;
      years and 5 aged 12-16 years for the INCA/Rafi-tone arm. However, due to low number of&#xD;
      participants completing the study, ethics approval was sought to extend the study. As a&#xD;
      result 35 participants were recruited at the end of the study period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 1:Novel electronic monitoring device (NEMD) issued Routine clinical care assessments&#xD;
      will be carried out at the end of the study period as below, including asthma control test&#xD;
      (ACT) or the childhood asthma control test (cACT), exhaled nitric oxide (FeNO) and spirometry&#xD;
      (FEV1 and BDR) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient/parent/Carer will be invited to take part in the study. Information regarding the&#xD;
      study and its objectives will be communicated to the Patient/parent/carer in both oral and&#xD;
      written form using patient information leaflets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All children will be issued with a novel electronic monitoring device which will be attached&#xD;
      to the child's usual inhaler or require an app on their mobile phone as described above.&#xD;
      Parents and children will be provided information and advice on the use of the novel&#xD;
      electronic monitoring device and asked to conduct up to 16 weeks of home monitoring using&#xD;
      their allocated NEMD on their first visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information on how to contact the team in case of any problems will be related to the&#xD;
      participant in both oral and written form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The data will be stored electronically and downloaded at the next clinic visit. Contact by&#xD;
      telephone will be made at day 7-14 to ensure that the device is working and to answer any&#xD;
      other queries then at week 6-7 to determine if the device is being used appropriately and to&#xD;
      answer any related questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 1 - for the rDOT arm, adherence data will be downloaded to check for consistencies in&#xD;
      inhaler technique. If inhaler technique is inaccurate, the participants will be called by the&#xD;
      respiratory nurse specialists to advise on correct technique. This will be documented as part&#xD;
      of the data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Week 4 - All devices, adherence data will be downloaded and checked to ensure that the&#xD;
      devices are working correctly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 2: up to 12 weeks of adherence data collection Routine clinical care assessments will&#xD;
      be carried out at the end of the study period as below, including asthma control test (ACT)&#xD;
      or the childhood asthma control test (cACT), exhaled nitric oxide and spirometry (FEV1 and&#xD;
      BDR) .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adherence data will downloaded at the end of the study period and stored electronically.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Visit 3: Focus group or one to one interviews The participants and their carers will be&#xD;
      invited to a face to face focus group interview, or a one to one interview, depending on&#xD;
      their availability at the end of the study period. The focus group and one to one interviews&#xD;
      will utilise a semi structured questionnaire, to provide qualitative feedback on the&#xD;
      acceptability and usability of the devices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A separate focus group meeting will also be conducted with the paediatric respiratory nurses&#xD;
      who are part of the Multi disciplinary Team (MDT) to assess their views on the devices used&#xD;
      as they routinely provided all asthma devices and are also involved in downloading data from&#xD;
      other devices that the investigators would use as part of routine care (smart-inhaler). They&#xD;
      will also be consented to take part in the study Where possible a second researcher from&#xD;
      University College London (UCL), Christina Pearce will sit in the focus groups discussion and&#xD;
      interviews to ensure there is no bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The conversations from the focus group and one to one interviews will be transcribed and&#xD;
      coded into themes. The investigators will utilise an external company for transcribing the&#xD;
      conversations called 1st Class.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus group and one to one interviews will be audio recorded, transcribed and put into&#xD;
      themes to conduct an inductive thematic analysis. 25% of the transcripts (8) will be double&#xD;
      coded by an independent researcher from UCL, Dr Amy Chan, experienced in qualitative research&#xD;
      to ensure that the correct themes have been used and to ensure that there is no bias.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The focus group and one to one interviews will be used to assess the usability and&#xD;
      acceptability of the devices&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The amount of usable data from each device will be quantified and compared. This will provide&#xD;
      data on the perceived accuracy of the device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The quantitative and qualitative results will be amalgamated and an evidence report prepared&#xD;
      to assess the feasibility of each device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An expert panel will be convened to select the most appropriate device to take forward to a&#xD;
      larger randomised controlled trial to assess the impact of the device on adherence in&#xD;
      children with asthma.&#xD;
