    <measure>Distance Binocular Visual Acuity (logMAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>20- Minutes Post-Lens Fitting</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity on logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale was evaluated at distance (4 meters) under high luminance high contrast, high luminance low contrast and low luminance high contrast with distance goggles using ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts. Letter-by-letter results calculated the visual performance score for each chart read. logMAR scores closer to zero, or below zero, indicate a better visual acuity. A logMAR value of 0.0 is equivalent to 20/20 Snellen vision.</description>

    <measure>Near BinocularVisual Acuity (logMAR)</measure>
    <time_frame>20- Minutes Post-Lens Fitting</time_frame>
    <description>Visual acuity on logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale was evaluated at near (40 cm) under High luminance low contrast and low luminance high contrast with distance goggles using ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts. Letter-by-letter results calculated the visual performance score for each chart read. logMAR scores closer to zero, or below zero, indicate a better visual acuity. A logMAR value of 0.0 is equivalent to 20/20 Snellen vision.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative Visual Acuity</measure>
    <time_frame>20- Minutes Post-Lens Fitting</time_frame>
    <description>Quantitative Visual Acuity (qVA) was measured at distance (4 meter) under low room illumination (4 lux), low luminance, high contrast conditions in the right eye only and in both eyes using AST Sentio vision Testing System. During testing 25 triplets of test letters were displayed on a large stationary monitor (118 CM), the operator recorded the patient's responses using the remote (Android Tablet). After a testing session had been completed the software calculated the VA threshold. VA threshold was defined as the logMAR stimulus size at which the expected probability of correct letter identification is 66%. when both eyes are measured. The average median VA threshold was reported for each lens. Lower values indicate better vision.</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Area Under Contrast Sensitivity Function Curve</measure>
    <time_frame>20- Minutes Post-Lens Fitting</time_frame>
    <description>Area under the log Curve was measured at 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 18 cycles per degree (cpd) in the right eye only and in both eyes using AST Sentio vision Testing System. During testing 25 triplets of test letters were displayed on a large stationary monitor (118 CM), the operator recorded the patient's responses using the remote (Android Tablet). After a testing session had been completed the software calculated the Area under the log contrast sensitivity function from 1.5 cpd to 18 cpd. The average area under the log curve was reported for each lens. Higher values indicate better vision. Number of eyes is 50 when both eyes are measured.</description>

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Potential subjects must satisfy all of the following criteria to be enrolled in the&#xD;
             study:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. The subject must read, understand, and sign the STATEMENT OF INFORMED CONSENT and&#xD;
                  receive a fully executed copy of the form&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Appear able and willing to adhere to the instructions set forth in this clinical&#xD;
                  protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
               4. Be a current soft contact lens wearer in both eyes with a minimum of 6 hours/day&#xD;
                  and 5 days/week over the last month by self-report.&#xD;

        <title>Distance Binocular Visual Acuity (logMAR)</title>
        <description>Visual acuity on logMAR (Logarithm of Minimal Angle of Resolution) scale was evaluated at distance (4 meters) under high luminance high contrast, high luminance low contrast and low luminance high contrast with distance goggles using ETDRS (Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study) charts. Letter-by-letter results calculated the visual performance score for each chart read. logMAR scores closer to zero, or below zero, indicate a better visual acuity. A logMAR value of 0.0 is equivalent to 20/20 Snellen vision.</description>

        <title>Quantitative Visual Acuity</title>
        <description>Quantitative Visual Acuity (qVA) was measured at distance (4 meter) under low room illumination (4 lux), low luminance, high contrast conditions in the right eye only and in both eyes using AST Sentio vision Testing System. During testing 25 triplets of test letters were displayed on a large stationary monitor (118 CM), the operator recorded the patient's responses using the remote (Android Tablet). After a testing session had been completed the software calculated the VA threshold. VA threshold was defined as the logMAR stimulus size at which the expected probability of correct letter identification is 66%. when both eyes are measured. The average median VA threshold was reported for each lens. Lower values indicate better vision.</description>
