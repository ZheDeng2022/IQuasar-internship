  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Chemotherapy for recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is palliative&#xD;
      and usually platinum based, and the patients often present with poor physical condition.&#xD;
      Consequently, many of them are not able to withstand a platinum-based chemotherapy. The&#xD;
      addition of taxanes to the armamentarium of drugs improve the outcome in this group of&#xD;
      patients. An alternative and better tolerated regimen for these patients is paclitaxel in&#xD;
      combination with cetuximab, included the in guidelines of the Spanish Society of Medical&#xD;
      Oncology.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, new treatments such as immune-checkpoint inhibitors have shown promising activity&#xD;
      and good tolerability in patients with recurrent or metastatic head and neck squamous cell&#xD;
      carcinoma and has been included in the recently published guidelines from the Society for&#xD;
      Immunotherapy of Cancer. Nivolumab (anti-PD1) has been approved for patients progressing on&#xD;
      or after platinum-based therapy, as it clearly impacts on overall survival.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized phase II study will evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab plus paclitaxel for&#xD;
      first-line treatment of recurrent or metastatic HNSCC in the platinum ineligible and platinum&#xD;
      refractory settings. Control arm will be paclitaxel in combination with cetuximab, treatment&#xD;
      included in the guidelines of the Spanish Society of Medical Oncology.&#xD;
