  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This project from the University Hospital of Parma (AOUPR) aims to verify the feasibility of&#xD;
      a prevention program in our district, relying on advanced technological resources and highly&#xD;
      experienced team in lung cancer early diagnosis, in order to identify useful elements towards&#xD;
      the applicability of such a prevention program on a large scale (regional, national).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Uncontrolled, monocentric experimental study with dynamic enrollment and prospective data&#xD;
      collection, aimed at implementing a prevention program based on scientific evidence. This&#xD;
      study is set to verify the applicability and feasibility of a lung cancer prevention program&#xD;
      in a real context, including a preliminary evaluation at the smoking cessation clinic and a&#xD;
      LDCT assessment with subsequent LDCT follow-up for participants who show indeterminate&#xD;
      findings at the first LDCT (LDCT baseline) exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of the study is to verify the feasibility of a lung cancer prevention&#xD;
      program according to internationally validated scientific methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the use of local smoking cessation clinics and their effects in terms of&#xD;
           smoking cessation (primary prevention)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To evaluate the outcomes of the program in terms of number of patients with early&#xD;
           (presymptomatic) lung cancer treated with minimally invasive surgery (secondary&#xD;
           prevention)&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To evaluate the number of false positives and their diagnostic work-up (PET-CT,&#xD;
           CT-guided biopsy, bronchoscopy)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint:&#xD;
&#xD;
      - Percentage of enrolled subjects to whom the program was offered within 60 days from the&#xD;
      date of enrolment and percentage of those who stop smoking for at least 12 months&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the organizational model, human resources employed, difficulties encountered&#xD;
           and elements that have favoured its realization&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the variation in smoking habits in enrolled smokers&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the effect of annual LDCT on lung cancer diagnosis rates, considering size,&#xD;
           shape, histology and site&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the consequent demand for further diagnostic investigations and treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To measure the number of false positives&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects at high risk of lung cancer screened by the medical team of the AOUPR or by GPs to&#xD;
      join the prevention program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Age between 50 and 75 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Equivalent tobacco intoxication of ≥ 15 cigarettes per day for ≥25 years or ≥ 10&#xD;
           cigarettes per day for ≥30 years&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Status of current smoker or ex-smoker for &lt;10 years.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Personal history of cancer within the prior 5 years&#xD;
&#xD;
      We expect to recruit around 500 people in 1 year. This sample size is considered adequate&#xD;
      based on the available resources, both human and economic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After closing and adjusting the database and before data analysis, a document called&#xD;
      Statistical Analysis Plan (SAP) will be drawn up. It will consist of the following&#xD;
      paragraphs:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical methods planned in the study protocol;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Size of the sample;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Management of missing data;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Evaluation of the endpoints;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical models that will be applied in the analysis. The socio-demographic&#xD;
           characteristics of the enrolled subjects, the adopted organizational methods and the&#xD;
           effects of the prevention program (endpoints) will be analyzed and described using&#xD;
           tables and figures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The project &quot;PRogetto Salute Parma: Primary and secondary prevention of smoking-related lung&#xD;
      cancer&quot; will be started once approved by the institutional Ethics Committee and authorized by&#xD;
      the General Manager. The study is expected to be carried out over 2 years (from the inclusion&#xD;
      of the first subject), with an expected period of 1 year for the enrolment and 1 further year&#xD;
      for follow-up.&#xD;

    The worldwide surge of SARS-CoV-2 started during the first week of the study. The Investigators&#xD;
    attempted to re-organize the project with a new agenda, but the time frame from the funding&#xD;
    Organization did not comply with the study needs.&#xD;
