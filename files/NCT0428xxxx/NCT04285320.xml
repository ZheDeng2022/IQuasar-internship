  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a research study that aims to determine if antibiotic bladder instillations (placing&#xD;
      an antibiotic directly into the bladder) over several sessions at the office is a good option&#xD;
      to prevent recurrent urinary tract infections, in comparison with oral suppression therapy&#xD;
      (taking daily antibiotics in the form of pills by mouth). Oral antibiotic suppression therapy&#xD;
      is currently the most common treatment route for recurrent urinary tract infections in&#xD;
      post-menopausal women. The bladder antibiotic instillation may overcome the disadvantages of&#xD;
      oral suppression therapy such as antibiotic resistance, certain side effects, and recurrence&#xD;
      of infections after finishing the treatment course.&#xD;

      In this study, the investigators aim to determine the effectiveness of intra-vesical&#xD;
      antibiotic instillations for the prophylactic treatment of recurrent urinary tract infections&#xD;
      in menopausal women in comparison with oral suppressive therapy. This is a parallel&#xD;
      un-blinded randomized-controlled trial. the investigators will randomize post-menopausal&#xD;
      women with recurrent urinary tract infections to either receive 6-8 intra-vesical antibiotic&#xD;
      instillations at the office or to receive 3 months of oral antibiotic suppressive therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the bladder instillation arm, based on the participant's allergy and antibiotic resistance&#xD;
      profile, one of the following three antibiotics will be instilled intravesically via a latex&#xD;
      free BARD® 12 French Foley catheter for a total of 6-8 instillations (2 instillations/week)&#xD;
      according to the Atlantic Health System Urogynecology Division antibiotic bladder&#xD;
      instillation standard protocol:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Amikacin-30 mg in 60 ml of sterile water&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gentamycin-80mg in 60ml sterile water&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Tobramycin-80 mg in 100 ml of sterile water&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the antibiotic oral suppression therapy arm, one of the following routinely used&#xD;
      antibiotics will be prescribed for a total of 3 months according to the American&#xD;
      Urogynecology Society Guidelines and based on the participant's allergy and antibiotic&#xD;
      resistance profile:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trimethoprim daily (100 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole daily (40 mg/200 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole every 3 days (40 mg/200 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals daily (50 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nitrofurantoin monohydrate/macrocrystals daily (100 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cephalexin daily (125 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cephalexin daily (250 mg)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Fosfomycin every 10 days (3 grams) All medications used in this study are approved by&#xD;
           the FDA to treat urinary tract infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be followed for total of 3 months after finishing either treatment course&#xD;
      by only reviewing their medical records to collect data regarding development of urinary&#xD;
      tract infections after treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary endpoint/outcome:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • To compare the number of women developing urinary tract infections during the 3 months&#xD;
      following treatment between the two groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary endpoints/outcomes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare the rate of antibiotic resistance of isolated pathogens after intravesical&#xD;
           antibiotic instillation vs. oral antibiotic suppressive therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To compare side effects of the two treatment modalities&#xD;
