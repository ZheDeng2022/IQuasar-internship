      Implementation intentions support people to turn intentions into action, and &quot;Volitional&#xD;
      Help-Sheets&quot; are a tool which helps people to form implementation intentions. The study will&#xD;
      recruit participants from secondary and tertiary mental health services. The participants&#xD;
      will be randomised to one of two groups. Participants in Group 1, the control group, will&#xD;
      receive the Volitional Help-Sheet (psychoeducational self-help sheet) but not form&#xD;
      implementation intentions. Participants in Group 2, the experimental condition, will use the&#xD;
      Volitional Help-Sheet to form implementation intentions. Participants will then complete an&#xD;
      acceptability and feasibility measure. At follow up, participants will repeat baseline&#xD;
      measures. The feasibility and acceptability of using a Volitional Help-Sheet to form&#xD;
      implementation intentions to help people using secondary and tertiary care mental health&#xD;
      services to reduce sedentary behaviour will be evaluated.&#xD;

      Introduction: Sedentary behaviour is risk factor for developing many health conditions.&#xD;
      People with mental health difficulties can be more sedentary and live 10 years fewer than&#xD;
      other populations. Implementation intentions support people to turn intentions into action,&#xD;
      and Volitional Help-Sheets are a tool which helps people to form implementation intentions,&#xD;
      by identifying critical situations and linking these to potential solutions. The feasibility&#xD;
      and acceptability of using a Volitional Help-Sheet to help people using secondary and&#xD;
      tertiary care mental health services to reduce sedentary behaviour will be evaluated. If&#xD;
      Volitional Help-Sheets are feasible and acceptable to use in this population, this will&#xD;
      justify further research in this area, as improving physical and psychological health could&#xD;
      increase life expectancy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: The study includes two timepoints: baseline and follow up (four weeks post baseline).&#xD;
      Participant characteristics/demographics collected at baseline. At both baseline and follow&#xD;
      up, all participants will be asked to complete measures of sedentary behaviour, physical&#xD;
      activity, well-being, motivation and mental health. Participants will be randomised to one of&#xD;
      two groups. Participants in Group 1, the control group, will receive the Volitional&#xD;
      Help-Sheet as a psychoeducational self-help sheet, but not form implementation intentions.&#xD;
      Participants in Group 2, the experimental condition, will use the Volitional Help-Sheet to&#xD;
      form implementation intentions. Participants will then complete an acceptability and&#xD;
      feasibility measure. At follow up, participants will repeat baseline measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size: Participants will be current service users, recruited from NHS based secondary&#xD;
      and tertiary care mental health services. The recruitment of a minimum of 24 participants and&#xD;
      a maximum of 32 participants would be considered a feasible two-armed study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recruitment: Adults: 18years+, motivated to decrease sedentary behaviour (demonstrated by&#xD;
      choosing to make contact with the researcher to indicate an interest in participation in the&#xD;
      study), has capacity to consent to study, currently receiving support from any secondary or&#xD;
      tertiary care mental health service and English language ability sufficient to be able to&#xD;
      meet the requirements of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure: Recruitment posters will be displayed in clinical areas as part of recruitment.&#xD;
      Care teams can advise interested participants on how to contact the researcher and support&#xD;
      this if required. Participant information sheets will be disseminated to interested parties.&#xD;
      Where a service user has informed the researcher of their interest in participating in the&#xD;
      study, they will be offered a detailed participant information sheet and consent to contact&#xD;
      forms outlining the study, the expected benefits and commitment required, and informed&#xD;
      consent forms. Interested participants will be assessed for capacity to consent and&#xD;
      eligibility and will begin the randomisation procedure upon booking the baseline assessment&#xD;
      appointment. All members of the research team have experience of obtaining informed consent&#xD;
      in research and clinical roles.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be block randomised (sampling without replacement) in blocks of four and&#xD;
      stratified according to clinical service using an online program, into either a control group&#xD;
      (group 1) or an experimental arm (group 2). Participants in Group 1 (control arm) will&#xD;
      receive a Volitional Help-Sheet with an instruction to tick all situations in which they are&#xD;
      tempted not to be active, and tick all solutions to overcome these. Participants in Group 2&#xD;
      (experimental arm) will use the Volitional Help-Sheet to form implementation intentions by&#xD;
      linking situations in which they are tempted not to be physically active, with solutions to&#xD;
      overcome these. Researchers will be unblinded, however the participants and those external to&#xD;
      the research team where involved will remain blind to the group allocated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcomes and analysis: The main study hypothesis is that forming implementation intentions&#xD;
      using the Volitional Help-Sheet will be considered acceptable to the participants involved in&#xD;
      the study, and that forming implementation intentions using the Volitional Help-Sheet will be&#xD;
      considered feasible to use within a diverse range of NHS settings. An exploratory hypothesis&#xD;
      is also that the increase in activity will be significantly greater in the treatment group&#xD;
      than the control group. Quantitative analysis will be used to evaluate the feasibility and&#xD;
      acceptability of using a Volitional Help-Sheet to help people using secondary and tertiary&#xD;
      care mental health services to form implementation intentions, with the aim of a reduction in&#xD;
      sedentary behaviour.&#xD;
