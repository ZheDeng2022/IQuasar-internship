  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose is to study the effects of dopamine activity, using methylphenidate ingestion, on&#xD;
      exercise and cognitive function over the course of a progressive cooling protocol. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesize that methylphenidate will minimize the previously reported&#xD;
      impairment in exercise performance and cognitive function with mild hypothermia and cold&#xD;
      stress (air temperature: 0˚C) compared to placebo, suggesting that dopamine activity&#xD;
      preserves exercise and cognitive capacity with mild hypothermia.&#xD;

      Temperature regulation and decision-making are vital aspects of human survival where&#xD;
      relatively small deviations in whole-body heat balance lead to decrements in physical&#xD;
      performance and cognitive function. Prolonged exposure to cold stress combined with&#xD;
      inadequate clothing and/or insufficient heat production can lead to decreases in body&#xD;
      temperature causing mild hypothermia (≤ -1.0˚C in body temperature). Performance in the cold&#xD;
      is more physically demanding compared to neutral environments (~22˚C) as there is increased&#xD;
      cardiovascular strain due to a strong peripheral vasoconstriction reducing cerebral and&#xD;
      muscle blood flow and oxygenation, reduced neuromuscular capacity, as well as changes in&#xD;
      energy metabolism during shivering and increased catecholamine release. Additionally, there&#xD;
      is an increased psychological strain where perceptually there is a high thermal discomfort,&#xD;
      alterations in neurotransmitters (e.g. dopamine, norepinephrine), and alterations in mood.&#xD;
      These changes lead to decreases in self-paced cycling time-trial performance in the cold with&#xD;
      mild hypothermia compared to thermoneutral environments. Additionally, there appears to be&#xD;
      task-dependent cognitive changes with acute cold stress, where higher-order functions such as&#xD;
      executive function, working memory, and inhibitory control decrease before simple task&#xD;
      performance such as reaction time and visual recognition/awareness. Currently, it is unknown&#xD;
      what the potential mechanisms are that lead to these performance decrements.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decrements in both self-paced exercise and cognitive function may be due to alterations&#xD;
      in neurotransmitters caused by hypothermia. Exposure to cold leads to alterations in&#xD;
      dopamine, and norepinephrine which may affect prefrontal cortex function, which may explain&#xD;
      why higher-order executive function tasks such as inhibitory control and spatial planning are&#xD;
      impaired compared to simple task performance. Previously, it has been determined that the use&#xD;
      of tyrosine (amino acid precursor to dopamine and norepinephrine neurotransmitters)&#xD;
      supplementation improves working memory and executive function despite a -2.0˚C drop in body&#xD;
      temperature through cold-water immersion, but not in thermoneutral conditions. However, it is&#xD;
      unknown what the role of dopamine or central nervous system stimulants are in the cold.&#xD;
      Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant through dopamine re-uptake inhibition&#xD;
      is demonstrated to improve executive function task performance in healthy adults in&#xD;
      thermoneutral conditions. Additionally, methylphenidate has been demonstrated to improve&#xD;
      self-paced cycling performance by 16% in the heat (30˚C) but not thermoneutral environments&#xD;
      (1). Methylphenidate is also demonstrated to improve maximal force production during&#xD;
      fatiguing exercise, indicating it may play a role in reducing the effects of fatigue during&#xD;
      endurance exercise. The investigators aim to determine the role of the central nervous system&#xD;
      using methylphenidate on cognitive function and self-paced exercise in the cold.&#xD;
