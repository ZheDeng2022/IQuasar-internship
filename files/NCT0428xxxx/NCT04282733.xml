      An 8 week course of mindfulness education and practices will be presented to all staff,&#xD;
      patients, and visitors voluntarily attending the thrice weekly presentations. The goal is to&#xD;
      reduce staff stress, improve communication, enhance patient satisfaction, and improve quality&#xD;
      of care.&#xD;

      &quot;Mindfulness Rounds&quot; Care-giver well-being is recognized as an important goal in decreasing&#xD;
      burnout, increasing job satisfaction, and may have implications in improving quality of care&#xD;
      and patient satisfaction. Mindfulness training is a well-studied tool used to enhance&#xD;
      care-giver well-being. The impact of a Mindfulness training experience for caregivers,&#xD;
      support staff, and patients and their families working together in a hospital unit on patient&#xD;
      satisfaction has not been well studied, if at all. The researchers propose instituting a&#xD;
      pilot program of Mindfulness Rounds on a given hospital unit and assessing the effect on&#xD;
      employee well-being, patient satisfaction, and quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The physical and mental health of healthcare practitioners (HCPs) has become an area of&#xD;
      attention and research in recent years as HCP burnout and suicide are now openly discussed&#xD;
      concerns in medicine. Well-being education is now a required curricula component by the&#xD;
      Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME). Mindfulness is a technique and&#xD;
      philosophical concept which has received significant attention in the medical literature as a&#xD;
      tool for increasing HCP well-being.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mindfulness describes the idea of maintaining a conscious presence in the present, of&#xD;
      avoiding obsessing about the past or the future, and of continuously being aware of, and&#xD;
      grateful for, the things we have in life as opposed to the things we don't. Mindfulness-Based&#xD;
      Stress Reduction (MBSR) is one particular system, developed by Jon Kabat-Zinn over 30 years&#xD;
      ago, which has been built into a well-structured certified training program for teaching&#xD;
      mindfulness. Numerous studies have used MBSR or similar techniques to advance HCP psychologic&#xD;
      well-being, and while some have investigated a variety of HCP training techniques to improve&#xD;
      the patient experience, few have sought to explore a relationship between the impact of&#xD;
      mindfulness training for HCP on patient satisfaction, quality of care outcomes, and HCP&#xD;
      overall health. To the investigators' knowledge, no one has sought to bring mindfulness&#xD;
      education to an entire hospital unit - physicians, nurses, support staff, as well as patients&#xD;
      and their families wherever possible - with the goal of improving both HCP and the overall&#xD;
      patient experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers propose instituting a pilot program of Mindfulness Rounds on a given hospital&#xD;
      unit and assessing the effect on employee well-being, patient satisfaction, and quality of&#xD;
      care.&#xD;
