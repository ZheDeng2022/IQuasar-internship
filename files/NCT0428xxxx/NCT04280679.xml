  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a one-arm, open label, prospective, single center study to evaluate clinical&#xD;
      standardization with Theraclion's Sonovein 2 HIFU device.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The original Sonovein device was tested in a clinical trial in 50 subjects and received CE&#xD;
      Mark. That device has been updated yielding the current version of Sonovein 2. Based on the&#xD;
      technical similarities between both devices in term of design, performance and principle of&#xD;
      operation, the clinical data for Sonovein is sufficient to assure conformity of the Sonovein&#xD;
      2 with the respected essential requirements. At the same time, the compagny wishes to pursue&#xD;
      the standardisation of the clinical practice with the second generation device and is,&#xD;
      therefore, conducting this limited trial in 20 evaluable cases (from the planned 22 patients&#xD;
      to be included). A &quot;case&quot; is defined as procedure conducted on a distinct vein.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The Sonovein 2 system provides high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) abaltion of soft&#xD;
      tissue. The energy is delievered via an extra-corporeal treatment probe, which includes an&#xD;
      imaging system. The high energy ultrasound waves propagate through the skin and are focused&#xD;
      on a portion of the target tissue, generating intense heat and causing local cell apoptosis&#xD;
      and progressive tissue volume reduction over the following months in the tissue within the&#xD;
      focal area. The process is then repeated in a stepwize fashion to destroy the targeted&#xD;
      tissues. The Sonovein 2 system is comprised of several components, including the console,&#xD;
      treatment arm containing the visualization and treatment unit (VTU), a computer with&#xD;
      touchscreen user interface. In addition, the Sonovein 2 system is intended to be used in&#xD;
      conjunction with a disposable cooling and coupling system known as ePack.&#xD;
