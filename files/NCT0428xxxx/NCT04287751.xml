      This study is looking at the way in which patients with obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) are&#xD;
      diagnosed. The investigators current practice is to offer patients who are referred to the&#xD;
      sleep centre with possible sleep apnoea a single night's oximetry recording. A decision is&#xD;
      then made based on this screening test as to whether the patient has OSA, does not have OSA&#xD;
      or requires a further investigation. There can be significant variation in the severity of&#xD;
      OSA between nights. This study is designed to investigate if recording data from multiple&#xD;
      nights will give any better indication on the presence and severity of obstructive sleep&#xD;
      apnoea. Patients referred for overnight oximetry recordings that report excessive daytime&#xD;
      sleepiness are eligible to enter the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
      On enrolment participants will all undergo a single night recording with the oximetry device&#xD;
      currently in use by the recruiting sleep centre. In addition they will be asked to wear the&#xD;
      prolonged recording oximeter (PRO) that allows for multiple nights data to be stored, and&#xD;
      continue wearing this for a total of four nights. On returning both oximetry devices, this&#xD;
      data will then be analysed and if it demonstrates evidence of OSA participants will return to&#xD;
      the standard clinical pathway and be offered a trial of treatment with continuous positive&#xD;
      airway pressure (CPAP) therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If no evidence of OSA is seen participants will also revert back to the standard clinical&#xD;
      pathway, which may involve a further inpatient sleep investigation being arranged.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of patients identified as having OSA based on the single first night recording&#xD;
      will be compared to those identified as having OSA only after the additional nights&#xD;
      recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All participants will return to the current standard pathway of care on leaving the trial.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA) is a common condition, effecting an estimated 1.5 million&#xD;
      people in the UK and it is believed up to 80% of them may be undiagnosed [1]. During sleep&#xD;
      the muscles supporting the upper airway tend to relax and the throat narrows. In patients&#xD;
      with OSA the narrowing leads to collapse and pauses in breathing. These pauses in breathing&#xD;
      are accompanied by a decrease in arterial oxygen saturation and to overcome the airway&#xD;
      collapse the body responds by producing a surge in the sympathetic nervous system. This has&#xD;
      the effect of stimulating the pharyngeal muscles to reopen the throat but also causes an&#xD;
      increase in heart rate, blood pressure and disrupts the sleep cycle waking the patient up.&#xD;
      These repeated disruptions to sleep leads to the patient feeling unrefreshed by sleep,&#xD;
      excessively sleepy during the day and at increased risk of a sleepiness-related accident. The&#xD;
      repetitive surges in the sympathetic nervous system also contributes to the risk of long term&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease. The frequency with which these events occur determines the severity&#xD;
      of obstructive sleep apnoea, less than 5 events per hour is considered normal, 5-15 mild,&#xD;
      15-30 moderate and more than 30 severe disease. However the disease severity does not&#xD;
      correlate with the degree of symptoms [2] meaning it is important to identify patients even&#xD;
      if they have mild and moderate disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OSA is effectively treated with continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) therapy. These&#xD;
      machines blow air into the throat through a nose or face mask. This helps to splint the&#xD;
      airway open and reduce the disruption to sleep. CPAP is an effective therapy improving&#xD;
      sleepiness, snoring, mood and reduces the long term risk of cardiovascular disease seen in&#xD;
      untreated patients with OSA.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Full inpatient polysomnography testing is the gold standard investigation for diagnosis and&#xD;
      exclusion of OSA [3]. However because polysomnography generally requires a hospital bed,&#xD;
      significant technical input to set up and is time intensive to report it is impractical for&#xD;
      the large numbers of patients referred to sleep services to undergo this test. Overnight&#xD;
      oximetry recording has been established as an effective alternative for screening patients&#xD;
      and identifying OSA in many sleep centres [4-6].&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a single test to be effective it needs to be highly sensitive and the condition being&#xD;
      investigated should be stable. However significant variation in the severity of obstructive&#xD;
      sleep apnoea has been demonstrated from night to night in individual patients [7, 8].&#xD;
      Therefore using oximetry or even polysomnography recording for a single night may not truly&#xD;
      reflect the overall condition. Patients with mild and moderate disease show the most&#xD;
      significant variations on a night to night basis, as the oxygen desaturation index (ODI,&#xD;
      number of times the oxygen saturations dip per hour) rises, i.e. more severe OSA, less night&#xD;
      to night variability is observed [9]. When patients with previously diagnosed OSA are&#xD;
      withdrawn from CPAP treatment and overnight oximetry performed for two weeks only 22% of&#xD;
      participants consistently remain within one severity category. The majority of these patients&#xD;
      were in the severe category. Other studies have shown 40-50% of patients changing severity&#xD;
      category in two to four nights recordings [7, 10] and that 16-20% of patients would not have&#xD;
      received CPAP treatment based on a single night study but did so after repeating between one&#xD;
      to three studies [10, 11].&#xD;
&#xD;
      The most clinically relevant distinction to make is between no OSA and mild and moderate OSA&#xD;
      as this determines whether a trial of CPAP therapy would be offered. These previous trials&#xD;
      suggest it is within this milder spectrum of the disease where a single night's oximetry&#xD;
      recording is least reliable and more than one night's recording may be required.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Despite CPAP being a very successful treatment for OSA, adherence rates to treatment are&#xD;
      variable [12, 13]. It has also be shown that adherence correlates with OSA severity [14]. In&#xD;
      part this poor adherence to treatment suggests imperfect identification of patients. The&#xD;
      investigators hypothesise that the current oximetry screening of a single night may not be&#xD;
      effectively identifying all those patients who may benefit from CPAP. The investigators aim&#xD;
      to identify how many additional patients are identified as having OSA with prolonged,&#xD;
      multi-night recordings. A longer period of oximetry recording may improve the identification&#xD;
      of those patients who may benefit from CPAP and may help to identify factors that predict a&#xD;
      poorer response to CPAP therapy. Therefore this study will follow-up patients to see if those&#xD;
      identified by prolonged oximetry screening tests leads to improved adherence to CPAP.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two different oximeters are used in this study. The Minolta i300 was chosen as it is the&#xD;
      current device used within the investigators clinical service. This is not being used for&#xD;
      prolonged recordings as the battery life makes it impractical to be used for more than two&#xD;
      nights recording. Therefore the CheckMeO2 oximeter was chosen; this has a rechargeable&#xD;
      battery and sufficient memory capacity to be used for the required 4 nights of recording.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The CheckMe O2 device records oxygen saturations to nearest whole number every 4 seconds&#xD;
      versus the Minolta device recording to one decimal place every second. It is felt that as the&#xD;
      average length of a desaturation in obstructive sleep apnoea is 15-20 seconds the CheckMe O2&#xD;
      device should be sufficiently accurate to detect OSA but by performing a simultaneous&#xD;
      recording during the first night the investigators hope to establish if this frequency of&#xD;
      recording is sufficient.&#xD;
