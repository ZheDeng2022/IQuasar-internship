    <textblock>
      The primary objective of the study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • to assess the safety and tolerability of multiple oral (twice daily [BID]) doses of TRK-750&#xD;
      in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with chemotherapy-induced peripheral&#xD;
      neuropathy (CIPN).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives of the study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to assess the efficacy of multiple oral (BID) doses of TRK-750 in reducing neuropathic&#xD;
           symptoms, improving quality of life (QoL), and clinician-reported outcomes in&#xD;
           oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with CIPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to study the relationship between plasma concentrations of TRK-750 and safety and&#xD;
           efficacy variables in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with CIPN.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The exploratory objective of this study is:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • to assess the efficacy of multiple oral (BID) doses of TRK-750 on pharmacodynamic (PD)&#xD;
      biomarker(s) in blood, psychophysical, electrophysiological, and histological parameters of&#xD;
      neuropathy in oxaliplatin-treated colorectal cancer patients with CIPN.&#xD;
