      The purpose of this investigator-initiated observational study is to examine how low Ketamine&#xD;
      infusion treatments impact antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects for refractory and&#xD;
      non-refractory depression.&#xD;

      This is a descriptive research study that will be collecting prospective outcome data in&#xD;
      patients who have been examined Psychiatry and the Intensive Care Unit attending. This study&#xD;
      will follow the patients examined and screened by both Psychiatry and the Intensive Care Unit&#xD;
      attending physician with orders for the use of ketamine bolus. This study will be examining&#xD;
      outcomes of the treatment and will be conducted within adult patients The electronic health&#xD;
      records will be reviewed for follow up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Primary Objective is to examine the use of Ketamine and the patient outcomes following&#xD;
      treatment in individuals with treatment resistant depression. The subjects with treatment&#xD;
      resistant depression will be identified by Psychiatric Consult using the Quick Inventory of&#xD;
      Depressive Symptomatology evaluation tool, have treatment resistant depression, no history of&#xD;
      psychosis, no active substance use, admitted to medical floor and confirmed acceptance to a&#xD;
      local Behavioral Medical Center.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedures involved (Research Interventions):&#xD;
&#xD;
      Psychiatric consult that includes:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. A full diagnostic psychiatric interview will be conducted to determine referral&#xD;
           appropriateness and discuss other options&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Review of systems and medical history completed&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Discussion of treatment alternatives&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Discussion of off-label use of Ketamine for treatment resistant depression&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Any necessary labs or additional consults will be suggested at this time. .&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Review the need to remain NPO for 8 hours prior to treatment and not to take&#xD;
           benzodiazepines (i.e., Ativan, Valium, Xanax, Klonopin), alcohol or narcotics (i.e.,&#xD;
           oxycodone, oxycontin, dilaudid, etc.) within 8 hours of the treatment with the patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Vitals Assessed on Evaluation - Cardiovascular parameters&#xD;
&#xD;
             1. Resting systolic BP between 90 and 150&#xD;
&#xD;
             2. Resting diastolic between 50 and 90 on exam.&#xD;
&#xD;
             3. If BP is above these parameters, will recommend hypertension be addressed with&#xD;
                patient's primary team prior to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
                Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomology Evaluation (see attached evaluation&#xD;
                tool)&#xD;
&#xD;
                Infusion of Ketamine per physician orders:&#xD;
&#xD;
             4. Ketamine 0.5mg/kg* dose IV in 50 mL NS will be infused at a set non-titratable rate&#xD;
                over 40 minutes or Ketamine 1mg/kg* dose IV in 50 mL NS will be infused at a set&#xD;
                rate non-titratable over 90 minutes. The dose that the subject will receive will be&#xD;
                determined by the Intensive Care Unit Attending based on patient symptoms. Ketamine&#xD;
                administered at these doses may result in the following adverse reactions such as&#xD;
                excessive sedation or drowsiness, or unpleasant hallucinations, agitation or&#xD;
                dysphoric reaction, nausea or increased oral secretions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data collection procedures: The following items will be extracted from the patient's&#xD;
      electronic health record: The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS SR-16)&#xD;
      completed pre and 24 hours post infusion by Psychiatry MD, vital signs pre, every 15 minutes&#xD;
      during infusion and within 5 minutes of completion of infusion and every 15 minutes after&#xD;
      until patient is has a PARS of 8 or greater or is back to baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will be given a unique identification number that will be used on all data&#xD;
      collection forms post procedure (infusion). The data will be de- identified after data&#xD;
      analysis. The key code will be stored in a separate location from the data stored in secure&#xD;
      drive on hospital computer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Individual subjects may benefit by treatment of their depression. Societal benefits will be&#xD;
      an increase in provider knowledge of the effect of this treatment for resistant depression&#xD;
      and the ability to quickly treat depression in an acute care setting.&#xD;
