  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a web-based study that involves monitoring hallmark symptoms of Parkinson's Disease&#xD;
      (PD), specifically dysphonia and tremor, using smartphone sensor data. The entire length of&#xD;
      the study will only take 5 minutes, so volunteers will not have to repeatedly contribute&#xD;
      data. The study is made up of 5 short, 10-second long activities, which include sustaining&#xD;
      the short a vowel sound to monitor changes in vocal fundamental frequency and holding a&#xD;
      smartphone in different positions on either side of the body to measure changes in amplitude.&#xD;
      To be a part of this study, volunteers must have an iPhone that is running on the software&#xD;
      iOS 13 or higher, because they will be asked to download a smartphone application from an&#xD;
      online App Store.&#xD;

      Participants will be asked to complete a series of activities, as outlined below.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. They will be asked to turn on &quot;Do Not Disturb&quot; and set their smartphone's volume to the&#xD;
           maximum. This is to ensure that they can hear narrated instructions guiding them through&#xD;
           the activities to come, and that data collection is uninterrupted.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Volunteers will sustain the short a vowel sound for 10 seconds. This is to analyze&#xD;
           PD-related dysphonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Volunteers will place their smartphone in their left hand and rest it in their lap for&#xD;
           10 seconds. This is to analyze PD-related rest tremor on the left side of the body.&#xD;
           (Duration: 10 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Volunteers will place their smartphone in their right hand and rest it in their lap for&#xD;
           10 seconds. This is to analyze PD-related rest tremor on the right side of the body.&#xD;
           (Duration: 10 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Volunteers will hold their smartphone face-down at shoulder-level, in their left hand.&#xD;
           This is to analyze PD-related postural tremor on the left side of the body. (Duration:&#xD;
           10 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Volunteers will hold their smartphone face-down at shoulder-level, in their right hand.&#xD;
           This is to analyze PD-related postural tremor on the right side of the body. (Duration:&#xD;
           10 seconds)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, participants will be asked to indicate their gender, age group, and status (whether&#xD;
      or not they have PD), for data-labeling purposes. Please note that all data is collected&#xD;
      anonymously and thus cannot be tracked down to a specific participant. Nevertheless, it will&#xD;
      be encrypted and stored in a secure database, with each participant corresponding to a GUID&#xD;
      (Global Unique Identifier), although participants will not be asked for their name. As this&#xD;
      is not a medical study, there are no expected medical side effects, however, certain&#xD;
      activities and questions may seem frustrating and boring.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will mainly benefit from the study indirectly, as it will increase understanding&#xD;
      of symptoms prevalent in early PD, and may contribute to the development of diagnostic tools.&#xD;

    <ipd_description>De-identified participant data may be made available to other researchers in a compiled dataset. 24 accelerometer features from each participant will be included in their entry, tagged by a GUID. Along with this, an audio file of them sustaining the short a vowel sound for 10 seconds will be a part of their entry. Finally, their status (control/PD), gender, and age-group will be included, so that statistical analyses can be made.</ipd_description>
