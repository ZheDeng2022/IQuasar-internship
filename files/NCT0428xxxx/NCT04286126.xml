      This study evaluates an accelerated schedule of theta-burst stimulation using a Transcranial&#xD;
      Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) device for treatment-resistant Obsessive Compulsive Disorder&#xD;
      (OCD). In a randomized fashion, half the participants will receive accelerated theta-burst&#xD;
      stimulation at the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC), while half will receive accelerated&#xD;
      theta-burst stimulation at the right orbitofrontal (rOFC) site.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Medications (SSRIs and D2 antagonists) and cognitive-behavioral therapy are the mainstays of&#xD;
      treating OCD; however, many patients show only a partial response, and more than 25% of&#xD;
      patients show no improvement with these treatments. Repetitive transcranial magnetic&#xD;
      stimulation (rTMS) is a promising alternative, using powerful, focused magnetic field pulses&#xD;
      to stimulate target brain areas. So far, at least two stimulation targets have consistent&#xD;
      evidence of efficacy in OCD: the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) and the orbitofrontal&#xD;
      cortex (OFC). Patients often show a strong response to one target but not the other. It is&#xD;
      not well understood why some patients respond, while others do not.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators previously developed methods for discovering neurophysiological subtypes of&#xD;
      depression based on resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) measures of&#xD;
      functional connectivity (RSFC) in relevant brain networks; diagnosing them in individual&#xD;
      patients; and using them to predict individual differences in rTMS response. Subsequently,&#xD;
      motivated by recent studies characterizing individual variability in the topology of these&#xD;
      functional networks, the investigators have optimized methods for improving the accuracy of&#xD;
      these predictions by accounting for individual variability, stabilizing the selection of&#xD;
      treatment-predictive features, and increasing robustness in replication samples through&#xD;
      regularization. Here, the investigators propose applying these methods to discover novel&#xD;
      network-based subtypes of OCD and develop prognostic neuroimaging biomarkers for predicting&#xD;
      differential treatment response to rTMS targeting the DMPFC or OFC, which could subsequently&#xD;
      be tested in a randomized clinical trial.&#xD;
