    <textblock>
      This study is aimed at providing an Italian version of two assessment tools for participation&#xD;
      in stroke patients, the Frenchay Activity Index (FAI) and the Walking Handicap Classification&#xD;
      (WHC) by a standardized translation and transcultural validation protocol. The protocol&#xD;
      includes a pre-test of the Italian version on ten patients, a final revision, and a&#xD;
      validation on a sample of 60 stroke patients.&#xD;

      This study is aimed at providing an Italian version of two tools to assess participation in&#xD;
      stroke patients, the Frenchay Activity Index (FAI) and the Walking Handicap Classification&#xD;
      (WHC). These tools have been recently indicated for the assessment of participation in Stroke&#xD;
      patients by the Italian Association of Physical and Rehabilitation Medicine (Minimal Stroke&#xD;
      Assessment Protocol - PMIC2); they are currently used in Italian research and clinical&#xD;
      settings, but no official translation exists. The process requires a standardized translation&#xD;
      protocol, including forward and backward translation, using a multistep revision structure,&#xD;
      to ensure conceptual and semantic equivalence. The validation process includes a pilot&#xD;
      evaluation of on 10 individuals post-stroke admitted to the Neurological Rehabilitation Unit,&#xD;
      Foundation Don Gnocchi Scientific Institute, and a validation on a sample of 60 stroke&#xD;
      patients including reliability, internal consistency and concurrent validity assessment of&#xD;
      the translated version against the Sickness Impact Profile (SIP) - Italian version and the&#xD;
      Rivermead Mobility Index (RMI) - Italian version, respectively&#xD;
