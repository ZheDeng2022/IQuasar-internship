  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) have difficulties towards the end of the&#xD;
      ambulatory period, especially in activities that require lower extremity proximal muscle&#xD;
      strength such as walking, climbing stairs, standing up without sitting. Stair climbing /&#xD;
      descending activity is a complex activity that requires joint stability, correct muscle&#xD;
      synergy and timing. When the literature is examined; It has been observed that the&#xD;
      performance of stair climb up and down activity in individuals with neuromuscular disease has&#xD;
      been evaluated with various clinical applications. In recent studies, there are surface&#xD;
      electromyography (EMG) studies evaluating various aspects of stair climbing and descending&#xD;
      activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Surface EMG; is a technique for neuromuscular evaluations that is frequently used in both&#xD;
      research and clinical applications, noninvasive, and can be used in areas such as&#xD;
      neurophysiology, sports science and rehabilitation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our study was planned to examine the muscle activations in the lower limb muscles involved in&#xD;
      climbing up stairs activity in children with DMD and to compare healthy children with&#xD;
      children with DMD and children with different levels of DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis originating from the investigation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      H0: There is no difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between&#xD;
      level 1 and level 2-3 children with early DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H1: There is a difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between&#xD;
      level 1 and level 2-3 children with early DMD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H2: There is no difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between&#xD;
      children with DMD and healthy children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      H3: There is a difference in the muscle activations measured by surface electromyography&#xD;
      (EMG) of the involved lower extremity muscles during climbing up stairs activity between&#xD;
      children with DMD and healthy children.&#xD;

      In our study, children will be assessed using the surface Electromyography (EMG) device by&#xD;
      using electrodes placed in the relevant lower limb muscles that take part during the stair&#xD;
      climbing activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study included 10 children with DMD levels were 1 and 10 children with DMD levels were&#xD;
      2-3 according to the Brooke Lower Limb Functional Classification scale and 10 healthy&#xD;
      children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Muscle activation of vastus lateralis, biceps femoris, tibialis anterior and gastrocnemius&#xD;
      medialis muscles will be measured by superficial electromyographic measurement. Muscle&#xD;
      activation according to SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) for&#xD;
      will be evaluated.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Stair climbing activity will be performed 3 times and at 1 minute intervals.&#xD;
