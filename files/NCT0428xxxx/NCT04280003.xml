    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter, doble blind, placebo controlled clinical trial to asses de safety and&#xD;
      efficacy of intravenous administration of alogenic adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells in the first four days from acute ischemic stroke.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Two spanish hospitals with teams experienced in stroke management will participate in this&#xD;
      study, recruiting a total of 30 patients between them both. After confirming that patients&#xD;
      fulfill the inclusion criteria and none of the exclusion criteria, informed consent will be&#xD;
      signed and randomization will take place (1:1). There are two different groups of treatment;&#xD;
      the first group will be treated with intravenous alogenic adipose tissue-derived stem cells&#xD;
      (at a concentration of one million cells per kg) within the first four days from stroke&#xD;
      onset, the second group will be treated will an intravenous placebo solution. Follow-up will&#xD;
      last for 24 months during which safety issues such as adverse events and neurological and&#xD;
      systemic complications will be assessed at 24 hours, 7 days and 3, 6, 12,18 and 24 months&#xD;
      after treatment. Neurological disability using the modified Rankin Scale and National&#xD;
      Institute of Health Stroke Scale will also be registered in every scheduled visit.&#xD;
      Biochemical markers of tissue repair (GM-CSF, BDNF, VEGF, TGF-1, GFAP, MBP, MMP-3) as well as&#xD;
      extracellular vesicles will be extracted on baseline visit as well as 7 days and 3 months&#xD;
      after treatment.&#xD;

             symptoms onset. If the time of symptom onset is unknown, this shall refer to the last&#xD;
             time the patient was observed as asymptomatic.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan compatible with&#xD;
             the clinical diagnosis of acute non-lacunar IS in the region of the middle cerebral&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Female subjects non-child bearing potential. Female subjects who are of&#xD;
             non-childbearing potential are defined as meeting at least 1 of the following&#xD;
             criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Have undergone a documented hysterectomy and/or bilateral oophorectomy; Have medically&#xD;
        confirmed ovarian failure; or Achieved postmenopausal status, defined as follows: cessation&#xD;
        of regular menses for at least 12 consecutive months with no alternative pathological or&#xD;
        physiological cause.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female subjects of child-bearing potential need a negative pregnancy test and must&#xD;
             agree to use adequate contraception for the duration of the study (from screening&#xD;
             through the final of the study). The following types of contraception are considered&#xD;
             adequate provided they are locally authorized for use: oral, transdermal, or&#xD;
             injectable (depot) estrogen and/or progestogen, selective estrogen receptor modulator&#xD;
             therapy, intrauterine contraceptive device, double barrier method (e.g., condom and&#xD;
             diaphragm or spermicidal gel) or vasectomy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Signed informed consent&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Comatose patients; patients with a score of 2 or more on item 1a of the NIHSS related&#xD;
             to the degree of awareness.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Evidence on neuroimaging of brain tumour, cerebral oedema with midline shift and a&#xD;
             clinically significant compression of ventricles, cerebellar or brainstem infarction&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Pre-existing dementia.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  A health status, any clinical condition (eg, short life expectancy, and coexisting&#xD;
             disease or a surgical or endovascular planned procedure) or other characteristic that&#xD;
             precludes appropriate diagnosis, treatment, or follow-up in the trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who are participating in another clinical trial.&#xD;
