  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>Feasibility of rapid, whole-body dynamic PET imaging as measured by number of participants who successfully complete the study imaging component</measure>
    <time_frame>Completion of imaging for all participants enrolled in the study (estimated to be 3 years)</time_frame>
    <description>-Successful completion of the study imaging component will be defined as: (1) patient remains on scanner for the full dynamic phase of PET imaging prior to the standard of care PET/CT and (2) automated scanner software is able to successfully generate valid parametric maps (requires at least three consecutive whole-body PET acquisitions without substantial motion between acquisitions).</description>
  </primary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Quantitative impacts of data motion correction (OncoFreeze) as measured by semi-quantitative standardized uptake value (SUV) metrics</measure>
    <time_frame>At the time of scan (Day 1)</time_frame>
    <description>Will be assessed by comparing motion-corrected images derived from OncoFreeze with standard static non-gated PET images and conventionally gated PET images.&#xD;
OncoFreeze is a novel approach to PET motion correction that utilizes 100% of events, which are corrected to an optimal gate image utilizing an optical flow algorithm, creating the potential for motion corrected images without increasing image noise.&#xD;
Two independent readers blinded to the reconstruction approach will score image quality utilizing a standard Likert-type scale and will extract quantitative metrics for any apparent FDG-avid lesions.</description>

    <measure>Repeatability of dynamic imaging as measured by calculating the measurement agreement in semi-quantitative PET metrics between test and retest dynamic images</measure>
    <time_frame>Day 1 and approximately 1 week later</time_frame>
    <description>-Imaging metric agreement will be measured using Bland-Altman analysis. Groupwise differences between imaging time-points will also be assessed using t-tests or Mann-Whitney U tests, depending on normality.</description>

    <measure>Metabolic rate of images</measure>
