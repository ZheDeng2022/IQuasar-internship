  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hormonal fluctuations present during the ovarian cycle may have a strong influence on&#xD;
      physiological and psychological aspects on physical performance in women. The aspects&#xD;
      surrounding performance and ovarian cycles in women during different phases of the cycle, are&#xD;
      still current and should be debated in the literature, as the available evidence has&#xD;
      conflicting results. In addition to the above, new ergogenic methods have been studied to&#xD;
      improve the sports scenario in different populations. Research on the use of ergogenic&#xD;
      electrophysical resources so that hormonal effects may possibly be mitigated, allowing women&#xD;
      to use this resource and improving their physical performance is still scarce in the current&#xD;
      literature.&#xD;

      Objective: To evaluate the physical performance of women during different phases of the&#xD;
      ovarian cycle and the influence of photobiomodulation therapy in this setting. Methods: The&#xD;
      research will be conducted in two subprojects - Subproject I is a cross-sectional study.&#xD;
      Initially the participants will be evaluated in two phases separately, being the first and&#xD;
      second day within the ovarian cycle in the follicular phase (FF) and the third and fourth day&#xD;
      in the luteal phase (FL). The aspects of body composition, body water volume and skin&#xD;
      temperature by infrared thermography will be evaluated, and the physical performance&#xD;
      evaluation will be constituted by the evaluation of the muscular performance by isokinetic&#xD;
      dynamometer, and by a treadmill supramaximal effort test. , together with analysis of VO2max&#xD;
      and blood lactate levels. Subproject II is a double-blind placebo-controlled randomized&#xD;
      clinical trial. After completion of subproject I, during the next ovarian cycle within the&#xD;
      participants will return to conduct the second part of the study, which will analyze the&#xD;
      influence of photobiomodulation therapy on the physical performance of women within their&#xD;
      menstrual cycle, related to low hormone rate ( FF). 200 J of energy will be applied before&#xD;
      each evaluation, which is muscle performance and endurance. The tests will be performed in&#xD;
      the same order, following the same protocol in both phases of the study. For data analysis, a&#xD;
      normality test will be used to verify the distribution and statistical tests consistent with&#xD;
      the appropriate intra and intergroup comparisons, being considered two factors in the&#xD;
      comparisons, time and group. A significance level of 5% will be adopted. The effect size will&#xD;
      be calculated by Cohens'd.&#xD;
