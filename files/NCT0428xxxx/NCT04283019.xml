  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of oral Cannabidiol&#xD;
      (with or without low levels of THC), under acute and chronic dosing conditions.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Participants (N=60), will be randomized to 1 of 3 oral dosing conditions that include: 100mg&#xD;
      CBD/3.7mg THC (0.39% THC), 100mg CBD/2.8mg THC (0.3% THC), or 100mg CBD/0mg THC (0.0% THC).&#xD;
      Participants will first complete an 8-hour drug administration session and after this initial&#xD;
      session, participants will take participants' assigned study drug for the next 14 days at&#xD;
      home, twice daily (participants will visit the lab on days 2, 7, and 14). Participants will&#xD;
      return on day 21 (after 1 week washout) for a final visit. During the 8-hour session and&#xD;
      visits occurring during the following 21 days, participants will provide biospecimens (urine,&#xD;
      blood, oral fluid, hair) which will be tested for cannabinoid concentrations. Pharmacodynamic&#xD;
      assessments (subjective and cognitive effects) will also be assessed during these visits.&#xD;
