  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well decitabine with ruxolitinib or fedratinib works before&#xD;
      hematopoietic stem cell transplant in treating patients with accelerated/blast phase&#xD;
      myeloproliferative neoplasms (tumors). Drugs used in chemotherapy, such as decitabine, work&#xD;
      in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping&#xD;
      them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Ruxolitinib and fedratinib may stop&#xD;
      the growth of tumor cells by blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Giving&#xD;
      chemotherapy before a donor hematopoietic stem cell transplant helps stop the growth of cells&#xD;
      in the bone marrow, including normal blood-forming cells (stem cells) and cancer cells. When&#xD;
      the healthy stem cells from a donor are infused into the patient they may help the patient's&#xD;
      bone marrow make stem cells, red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. The donated&#xD;
      stem cells may also replace the patient's immune cells and help destroy any remaining cancer&#xD;
      cells. Decitabine, with ruxolitinib or fedratinib, may work better than multi-agent&#xD;
      chemotherapy or no pre-transplant therapy, in treating patients with accelerated/blast phase&#xD;
      myeloproliferative neoplasms.&#xD;

      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients receive decitabine intravenously (IV) once daily (QD) over 1 hour on days 1-10, and&#xD;
      either ruxolitinib orally (PO) twice daily (BID) or fedratinib PO daily on days 1-28.&#xD;
      Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up for up to 5 years.&#xD;

          -  Active systemic fungal, bacterial, viral, or other infection, unless disease is under&#xD;
             treatment with anti-microbials and/or controlled or stable (e.g. if specific,&#xD;
             effective therapy is not available/feasible or desired [e.g. chronic viral hepatitis,&#xD;
             human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)])&#xD;
