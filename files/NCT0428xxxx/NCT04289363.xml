  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Using mixed methods and triangulating multiples sources of data collected over the course of&#xD;
      the parent (CTN-0079) and the ancillary studies to evaluate the feasibility, acceptability,&#xD;
      sustainability and impact of the ED-initiated BUP clinical program and implementation&#xD;
      facilitation strategy and identify factors influencing diffusion and effectiveness.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The ancillary study will use mixed-methods combining quantitative and qualitative inquiry&#xD;
      (interview/focus group and field notes) with administrative and health record data with some&#xD;
      analyses including data collected from the parent CTN-0079 study. Further, qualitative data&#xD;
      will be analyzed in the context of themes derived from CTN-0069 and CTN-0079. CTN-0079-A1 is&#xD;
      planned to be conducted at two of the three sites of the parent study: (1) Catholic Medical&#xD;
      Center, Manchester, NH; (2) Bellevue/NYU Health and Hospitals, New York, NY. Many of the&#xD;
      methods, operating procedures, measures and forms will be retained or adapted from the parent&#xD;
      study. However, CTN-0079-A1 is a new study in which lessons learned through the parent study&#xD;
      have informed important design modifications necessary to improve study rigor and utility.&#xD;
