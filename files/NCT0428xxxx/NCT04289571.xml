  <brief_summary>

      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retina is a thin layer of tissue at the back of the eye. Retinal disease usually reduces&#xD;
      a person s mobility because it affects how he or she moves through familiar and unfamiliar&#xD;
      environments. Researchers want to see if a virtual reality (VR) tool can provide an easier&#xD;
      and more accurate way to assess mobility.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective:&#xD;
&#xD;
      To learn if researchers can track changes in mobility in people with retinal disease using a&#xD;
      new VR tool.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligibility:&#xD;
&#xD;
      People aged 5 and older with retinal disease that affects their vision, and healthy&#xD;
      volunteers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have 1-2 clinic visits.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will wear goggles while sitting. Using a game controller, they will navigate&#xD;
      through 4 obstacle courses presented in VR.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a medical history and physical exam. They will answer questions about&#xD;
      their family history. They will fill out questionnaires about the vision and mobility issues&#xD;
      they have in their daily lives.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have a complete eye exam. They will read letters from a chart. Their eye&#xD;
      pressure will be measured. Their pupils may be dilated with eye drops. Pictures of their eye&#xD;
      will be taken. Lights will be shined in their eyes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will take a visual field test. For this, they will look into a dome and press a&#xD;
      button when they see a light.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have an electroretinogram. For this, they will sit in the dark with their&#xD;
      eyes patched. Then their eyes will be numbed with eye drops and they will wear contact lenses&#xD;
      while watching flashing lights.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will have optical coherence tomography. This is a noninvasive procedure. It&#xD;
      produces cross-sectional pictures of the retina....&#xD;

      Objective: Designing clinical trials for advanced retinal disease represents an especially&#xD;
      difficult challenge due to the lack of suitable outcome measures. Clinical measures such as&#xD;
      visual field and area of atrophy measured with multimodal imaging may be highly variable&#xD;
      and/or difficult to measure in this population. A main contributor to disability in the&#xD;
      visually impaired is poor mobility, which is a quality of life measure used to assess&#xD;
      visually-guided behavior in low-vision patients. The goal of our study is to determine&#xD;
      whether parameters from a recently developed virtual reality (VR) mobility assessment tool&#xD;
      may serve as biomarkers of functional vision in participants with advanced retinal disease.&#xD;
      The long-term goal will be to determine whether the VR mobility assessment tool parameters&#xD;
      can document longitudinal changes in functional vision and serve as a suitable outcome&#xD;
      measure for clinical trials in participants with advanced retinal disease.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Population: Up to 120 participants with retinal disease and 45 healthy volunteers will&#xD;
      be recruited. The upper limit of 120 participants with retinal disease was chosen to allow&#xD;
      approximately equal groups of 60 participants with rod-cone degeneration (RCD) and 60&#xD;
      participants with cone-rod degeneration (CRD) to represent groups of participants with&#xD;
      peripheral visual field constriction and central vision loss, respectively. A total of 60 per&#xD;
      group was chosen to A) allow feasibility to be determined across age groups (e.g., 5-11 yrs.,&#xD;
      12-50 years, over 50 years) and B) to allow for a sufficient range of disease severity to&#xD;
      examine VR mobility test sensitivity. The number of healthy volunteers (N=45) was chosen to&#xD;
      provide about 15 participants across each of three age groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Design: In this multi-site observational study, VR mobility testing will be performed in&#xD;
      participants with retinal disease. While the ultimate goal is to use this for advanced&#xD;
      retinal disease, in the current study we will examine patients with a wide range of retinal&#xD;
      disease severity to enable correlations between VR mobility parameters and markers of disease&#xD;
      severity (e.g. field size, mobility scores from questionnaires). This analysis will also help&#xD;
      determine the range of retinal disease severity for which VR mobility will be useful. Testing&#xD;
      will also include best corrected visual acuity (BCVA), visual fields, optical coherence&#xD;
      tomography (OCT), autofluorescence imaging, ultra-widefield imaging and participant reported&#xD;
      outcome (PRO) questionnaires. Based on the simulation studies, we predict that participants&#xD;
      should be able to repeat the VR course between four to eight times in a one-hour session.&#xD;
      Participants will be required to attend up to two clinic visits within three months. VR&#xD;
      testing will be the focus of the second clinic visit in order to A) examine the learning&#xD;
      effect and B) quantify test-retest variability of VR test parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Measures: The primary outcome is to determine whether parameters from a recently&#xD;
      developed VR mobility tool can serve as biomarkers of functional vision in participants with&#xD;
      retinal disease. To this end, we will examine the correlation between VR mobility test&#xD;
      parameters (e.g., accuracy, task time) and clinical measures of retinal structure and&#xD;
      function (e.g., visual acuity, non-seeing area) and the mobility score from a PRO&#xD;
      questionnaire/s. Other primary outcomes include quantifying the learning effect and&#xD;
      test-retest variability of the VR test parameters. A secondary outcome is to examine whether&#xD;
      prior or present computer game playing (e.g., number of hours, type of games played, computer&#xD;
      game platform) influences baseline performance on the VR mobility tool.&#xD;
