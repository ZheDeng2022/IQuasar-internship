      The objective of this protocol is to test the effectiveness of a Jumpstart intervention on&#xD;
      patient-centered outcomes for patients with chronic illness by ensuring that they receive&#xD;
      care that is concordant with their goals over time, and across settings and providers. This&#xD;
      study will examine the effect of the EHR-based intervention to improve quality of palliative&#xD;
      care for patients 55 years or older with chronic, life-limiting illness with a particular&#xD;
      emphasis on Alzheimer's disease and related dementias (ADRD). The specific aims are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the effectiveness of a novel EHR-based (electronic health record) clinician&#xD;
           Jumpstart guide, compared with usual care, for improving the quality of care; the&#xD;
           primary outcome is documentation of a goals-of-care discussion in the period between&#xD;
           randomization and 30 days following randomization. Secondary outcomes focus on intensity&#xD;
           of care: ICU use, ICU and hospital length of stay, costs of care during the&#xD;
           hospitalization, and 7 and 30-day hospital readmissions.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To conduct a mixed-methods evaluation of the implementation of the intervention, guided&#xD;
           by the RE-AIM framework for implementation science, incorporating quantitative&#xD;
           evaluation of the intervention's reach and adoption, as well as qualitative analyses of&#xD;
           interviews with participants, to explore barriers and facilitators to future&#xD;
           implementation and dissemination.&#xD;

      OVERVIEW: This is a large pragmatic trial of the Jumpstart intervention designed to promote&#xD;
      goals-of-care discussions for older, seriously ill, hospitalized patients. The trial recruits&#xD;
      consecutively eligible patients from three UW Medicine hospitals. The Jumpstart Guide is a&#xD;
      communication-priming intervention that addresses hospitalized patients' goals of care. It&#xD;
      includes information, drawn from the electronic health record (EHR), identifying the dates&#xD;
      and locations of prior advance care planning documents (e.g. living wills, healthcare&#xD;
      directives, durable power of attorney for healthcare, and Physician Orders for Life&#xD;
      Sustaining Treatments (POLST)) and patients' code status. This information is provided by&#xD;
      email to patients' clinicians. The Jumpstart Guide includes tips to improve this&#xD;
      communication. The trial will assess the effectiveness of the EHR-based clinician Jumpstart&#xD;
      as compared with usual care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This current study is &quot;Trial 1&quot; of the R01 Award funding this trial. Trial 2 was initiated&#xD;
      following the completion of recruitment for Trial 1.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 1 (for Trial 1): Evaluate the efficacy of the EHR-based clinician Jumpstart&#xD;
      compared to usual care for improving quality of care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      TRIAL 1 has three components.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 1- Subject Identification/Recruitment/Randomization: The investigators will use&#xD;
      automated methods with EHR data, including natural language processing/machine learning&#xD;
      (NLP/ML) approaches, to identify hospitalized patients with serious illness during the first&#xD;
      2-3 days of this specific admission. Screening reports will be produced daily and include all&#xD;
      likely eligible patients. Study staff will use these daily screening reports to review&#xD;
      individual records of eligible patients for inclusion and exclusion criteria (i.e. verify&#xD;
      eligibility). Patients will not be approached for consent. Eligible patients will be assigned&#xD;
      to intervention or comparator in a 1:1 ratio. Patients are randomized using variable size&#xD;
      blocks and stratified for hospital and ADRD vs. no ADRD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 2- EHR-based Clinician Jumpstart Guide: The Jumpstart guide is developed by&#xD;
      applying NLP/ML algorithms to both inpatient and outpatient EHR notes (e.g., progress notes,&#xD;
      specialty consult notes, alerts and care plans) preceding the current hospitalization. It&#xD;
      summarizes the presence/absence of POLST, advance directives and DPOA (durable power of&#xD;
      attorney) documentation and the patients' code status. It also provides general&#xD;
      recommendations to initiating goals of care discussions. Jumpstart guides are prepared for&#xD;
      the intervention group only.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Component 3- Delivery of the intervention: For the intervention group, the investigators&#xD;
      deliver the Jumpstart guide to the primary hospital team (attending and resident physicians&#xD;
      and advanced practice providers) via secure email. The Jumpstart guides are delivered within&#xD;
      1 business day of patient randomization. Study staff monitor the care team of the patient,&#xD;
      and if there are any changes, ensure that any new providers receive the Jumpstart guide as&#xD;
      well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Comparator: The hospital teams for patients in the control group do not receive Jumpstart&#xD;
      guides.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Outcome Assessment. Outcomes are obtained from the EHR and use, in part, NLP/ML methods. The&#xD;
      primary outcome is EHR documentation of goals-of-care discussions in the 30 days following&#xD;
      randomization. Secondary outcomes are measures of intensity of care, including utilization&#xD;
      metrics (i.e., ICU admissions, ICU and hospital lengths of stay, 30-day hospital&#xD;
      readmissions), costs of care during hospital admission, and estimated costs of implementing&#xD;
      the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SPECIFIC AIM 2 (Trial 1): Evaluate implementation of the Jumpstart Guide and identify&#xD;
      barriers and facilitators to future implementation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Qualitative evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinician recruitment: Study staff will recruit clinicians who were involved with the study&#xD;
      to participate in a short interview after the clinician's study involvement with the enrolled&#xD;
      patient has ended. Clinician participants will be selected using purposive sampling to ensure&#xD;
      a diverse group (e.g., age, race/ethnicity, gender, specialty, year of training).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Interview: Using an interview guide developed specifically for this project, interviewers&#xD;
      will assess respondents' experience with the intervention and gather suggestions for ways to&#xD;
      improve the intervention's content, delivery and implementation, including implementation&#xD;
      outcomes (e.g., acceptability, fidelity, penetration, maintenance) that will guide future&#xD;
      dissemination of the intervention.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment: Interviews are audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using thematic analytic&#xD;
      methods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative evaluation:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Quantitative evaluation for Specific Aim 2 will be guided by the RE-AIM framework. We will&#xD;
      evaluate the intervention's: 1) Reach (% of all identified eligible clinicians, patients and&#xD;
      families that participated in the study); 2) Adoption (% of eligible services that&#xD;
      participated); and 3) Implementation (the proportion of HTML Jumpstart Guides that were&#xD;
      opened by a clinician, proportion of patients for whom an HTML JS guide was sent and for whom&#xD;
      a JS was opened by a clinician).&#xD;

    <description>The Jumpstart Guide is a communication-priming intervention for clinicians that addresses hospitalized patients' goals of care. The intervention's goal is to prompt clinicians to provide standard of care which includes a discussion with patients or their legal surrogate decision-maker about their goals of care. The one-page Jumpstart Guide provides information to the clinician about prior advance care planning documentation and code status derived from the EHR. The Jumpstart Guides includes tips to improve goals-of-care communication.</description>
