      Note that this is a study that is co-sponsored by Medecins Sans Frontieres, Spain, and the&#xD;
      University of Oxford.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective is to develop a risk prediction algorithm, combining measurements of&#xD;
      host biomarkers and clinical features at the point-of-triage, for children with an acute&#xD;
      febrile illness in resource-limited settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objectives are to determine which host biomarkers, feasible for measurement at&#xD;
      the point-of-care, are predictive of disease severity. Additionally to determine the optimal&#xD;
      combination of clinical features (including demographics, anthropometric data, historical&#xD;
      variables, vital signs, clinical signs and clinical symptoms), feasible for assessment by&#xD;
      limited-skill health workers, that is predictive of disease severity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tertiary objectives are to explore the impact of different methods of outcome&#xD;
      classification on development of the risk prediction algorithm, and to explore the&#xD;
      performance of the algorithm to predict disease severity in key presenting clinical syndromes&#xD;
      and aetiologies.&#xD;

      Background&#xD;
&#xD;
      Febrile illnesses are amongst the most common reasons that parents seek non-routine&#xD;
      healthcare for their children and a proportion progress to severe disease with substantial&#xD;
      risk of mortality. Sepsis, defined as acute life-threatening organ dysfunction caused by a&#xD;
      dysregulated host response to infection, carries significant morbidity. Incidence is highest&#xD;
      in the paediatric age-range, with an estimated over four million children developing sepsis&#xD;
      each year. This estimate is necessarily conservative, as the burden of sepsis is greatest in&#xD;
      low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) where population-level data are not readily&#xD;
      available.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Distinguishing febrile children that require referral or admission to hospital, from those&#xD;
      who can safely be cared for in the community, is challenging. In many tropical settings&#xD;
      rational triage is especially difficult: healthcare providers receive limited training, and&#xD;
      many acute febrile syndromes are clinically indistinguishable yet have different disease&#xD;
      trajectories and require different interventions. Particularly in conflict settings, referral&#xD;
      decisions involve complex mechanisms, costs and risks to both patient and provider.&#xD;
      Consequently, patient outcomes are compromised: children with severe disease go unrecognised,&#xD;
      whilst those with milder illnesses are unnecessarily hospitalised.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Healthcare providers are trained to perform systematic clinical assessments, which focus on&#xD;
      eliciting symptoms and signs that predict poor outcomes. Whilst tools such as the World&#xD;
      Health Organization's Integrated Management of Childhood Illness (IMCI) aim to support this,&#xD;
      results are inconsistent and adherence is poor. Integration of several syndrome-specific&#xD;
      algorithms is impractical for many limited-skill health workers. A recent systematic review&#xD;
      concluded that validity of existing paediatric triage tools is uncertain and that none are&#xD;
      likely to be reliable in resource-constrained environments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Numerous clinical severity scoring systems predict deterioration in hospitalised patients and&#xD;
      recent attempts have been made to adapt these to the paediatric population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, many require physiological variables that are only routinely measured in the&#xD;
      intensive care unit (ICU) and simplified versions perform inconsistently. In addition, the&#xD;
      generalisability of these tools to LMICs is uncertain and further work is required to explore&#xD;
      their utility at the point-of-triage.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Spot Sepsis will collect the necessary data to permit a multi-country evaluation of existing&#xD;
      severity scoring systems at the point-of-triage, and determine whether a combinatorial&#xD;
      approach, utilising simple-to-elicit clinical features and measurement of host biomarkers,&#xD;
      holds potential for widespread public health impact.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Context-appropriate tools that enable reliable disease severity assessment in febrile&#xD;
      children have great potential to improve patient outcomes and ensure optimal allocation of&#xD;
      scarce resources. Pathogen-specific diagnostics alone are not sufficient to improve clinical&#xD;
      management of febrile illness: the majority of children in LMICs present to facilities with&#xD;
      limited diagnostic support and even well-resourced research studies often only ascertain a&#xD;
      microbiological cause in a minority of febrile patients. Furthermore, in many circumstances,&#xD;
      even when a pathogen is identified a child's illness trajectory can remain unpredictable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characterising the host response represents an alternative strategy, which has potential to&#xD;
      be robust to heterogeneity in fever aetiology and applicable to all febrile children&#xD;
      irrespective of whether a microbiological cause of their illness can be identified. Given&#xD;
      wide-ranging pathogen (aetiology and/or inoculum) and host (genetic and/or immunological)&#xD;
      diversity, tools that combine multiple parameters are likely to be most effective: a uniform&#xD;
      pathophysiological disturbance is unlikely.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score is proposed as a parsimonious tool to&#xD;
      risk stratify adults admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with suspected infection.&#xD;
      Recent work has adapted SOFA for paediatric use (pSOFA), with encouraging results. However&#xD;
      both SOFA and pSOFA are validated for patients admitted to the ICU. Whilst quick-SOFA&#xD;
      (qSOFA), a simplified version of SOFA consisting of three simple clinical variables (mental&#xD;
      status, respiratory rate and systolic blood pressure), performs well in hospitalised adults&#xD;
      outside of the ICU, it appears less useful in LMICs, when adapted for use in children and&#xD;
      outside the hospital setting. Of note, abnormal systolic blood pressure is known to be a late&#xD;
      sign in unwell children and sphygmomanometers are often not present outside of hospital&#xD;
      settings in LMICs. Recognising that different clinical parameters may be relevant for febrile&#xD;
      children at the point-of-triage in LMICs, a recent modified-Delphi process identified 45&#xD;
      possible predictors of paediatric sepsis feasible for collection in resource-limited&#xD;
      settings. Which of these might be most important is yet to be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Simple clinical assessments (for example, the Lambaréné Organ Dysfunction Score [LODS])&#xD;
      predict in-hospital mortality in children with febrile illnesses in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA).&#xD;
      In children with severe malaria performance of these assessments improves when combined with&#xD;
      measurement of certain host biomarkers, such as those reflecting endothelial and immune&#xD;
      activation, including angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2) and soluble triggering receptor expressed on&#xD;
      myeloid cells-1 (sTREM-1). Importantly, this contrasts with laboratory indicators such as&#xD;
      venous lactate, which although predictive of mortality in children with febrile illness, does&#xD;
      not improve discrimination of clinical assessment.30,31 This suggests that whilst&#xD;
      conventional laboratory indicators may be crude biochemical surrogates for clinical&#xD;
      assessment, certain biomarkers may reflect sub-clinical endothelial and immune activation,&#xD;
      and have potential to improve identification of children at risk of severe febrile illness.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Most studies to date have focused on malaria in African children. Limited data exists from&#xD;
      Asia, and non-malarial febrile illnesses are comparatively understudied. However, recent work&#xD;
      suggests endothelial and immune activation play a central role in the pathophysiology of&#xD;
      severe infection across a spectrum of microbial aetiologies, including dengue, bacterial&#xD;
      sepsis and influenza. Furthermore, whilst most studies have enrolled hospitalised children, a&#xD;
      recent study recruiting adults attending Tanzanian outpatient clinics, suggests that this&#xD;
      approach could aid triage when patients first present to care from the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assumptions, limitations and generalisability&#xD;
&#xD;
      The fundamental assumption underlying this approach is that there are final common pathways&#xD;
      to severe febrile illness and that markers of these pathways will be elevated and measurable&#xD;
      at a sufficiently early point in the course of an illness, to meaningfully contribute to&#xD;
      patient assessment and triage. Whilst this is known for clinical parameters such as vital&#xD;
      signs, a growing body of evidence supports this thesis: endothelial and immune activation&#xD;
      appear to be part of a final common pathway to severe illness. Furthermore, alterations in&#xD;
      microvascular physiology occur early in the disease course of common childhood febrile&#xD;
      illnesses.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study will recruit children aged &gt; 28 days and &lt; 5 years presenting with an acute&#xD;
      febrile illness. Hence, the major limitations are the exclusion of neonates and older&#xD;
      children, and the decision to base the eligibility criteria around fever. This will limit the&#xD;
      ability to develop a parsimonious tool for all children presenting with suspected infection&#xD;
      in the community.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to limit recruitment to children aged &gt; 28 days and &lt; 5 years reflects the fact&#xD;
      that, (a) all febrile neonates require further assessment, (b) outside the neonatal range,&#xD;
      the biggest burden of disease affects children under the age of five, and (c) including older&#xD;
      children would require substantially greater resources to ensure power to examine interaction&#xD;
      of predictive performance with age.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The decision to limit the study to children with an abnormal temperature or short history of&#xD;
      fever reflects the fact that, (a) these inclusion criteria are expected to capture the&#xD;
      majority of children with suspected sepsis (TuNDRA study, Angkor Hospital for Children&#xD;
      [OxTREC 512-17; 287 NECHR], unpublished data), and (b) limiting this initial study to the&#xD;
      febrile population will constrain heterogeneity, increasing likelihood of success whilst&#xD;
      still addressing an important public health problem.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to develop a risk prediction algorithm to improve disease severity assessment&#xD;
      of febrile children in rural and/or remote community settings and decentralised models of&#xD;
      care. However, derivation of a prediction algorithm requires a certain number of 'outcome&#xD;
      events' (episodes of severe illness), and hence recruiting febrile children presenting at&#xD;
      peripheral levels of the health system would be logistically and financially challenging.&#xD;
&#xD;
      To overcome this challenge, Spot Sepsis will recruit patients presenting to mid-level health&#xD;
      facilities, for example, district and/or provincial hospitals, where severe illness occurs&#xD;
      more frequently. However, the investigators recognise that this compromise risks a potential&#xD;
      loss of generalisability to community settings (the ultimate intended-use setting for the&#xD;
      algorithm).&#xD;
&#xD;
      To mitigate this risk, the sites selected for Spot Sepsis serve as a primary point of&#xD;
      healthcare access for a predominantly rural and/or underserved population, the demographics&#xD;
      of which are representative of patients presenting to lower levels of care. Hence the primary&#xD;
      difference between the Spot Sepsis sites and eventual intended-use sites, is the frequency&#xD;
      with which children at risk of severe illness attend, rather than systematic differences in&#xD;
      their demographic characteristics (acknowledging that there can be differences in patients&#xD;
      presenting to hospital outpatient departments compared to community care settings). This will&#xD;
      maximise the chance of successful out-of-sample validation and generalisability of the tool&#xD;
      to community settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      NOTE&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, a greater understanding of biomarker kinetics is crucial. To investigate this&#xD;
      further the investigators will perform an exploratory nested case-control sub-study at the&#xD;
      Cambodia site to investigate whether the kinetics of the biomarker response differs between&#xD;
      hospitalised children who develop severe illness and hospitalised controls. Furthermore,&#xD;
      findings that the angiopoietin axis can remain activated beyond apparent clinical resolution,&#xD;
      and conveys excess post-discharge mortality risk, is concordant with high post-discharge&#xD;
      mortality observed in adults with bacterial sepsis and in hospitalised children in LMICs. If&#xD;
      confirmed, measuring biomarkers of endothelial and immune activation at discharge could help&#xD;
      prioritise at-risk children for follow-up. At the Cambodia site biomarker levels will be&#xD;
      measured at discharge and patient follow-up extended to six months to determine if children&#xD;
      at risk of poor outcomes can be readily identified prior to discharge and prioritised for&#xD;
      outpatient or community-based follow-up.&#xD;
