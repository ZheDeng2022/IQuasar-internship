  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase II trial testing disease-specific myeloablative conditioning regimens for&#xD;
      preparatory cytoreduction of patients receiving allogeneic HLA-compatible related or&#xD;
      unrelated transplants of GCSF-mobilized peripheral blood stem cells (PBSC) depleted of&#xD;
      T-cells by positive selection of CD34+ progenitor cells using the CliniMACS system. The&#xD;
      CliniMACS Fractionation system is a method that positively selects CD34+ progenitor cells&#xD;
      from PBSC by immunoadsorption of cells binding on anti CD34 monoclonal antibody to&#xD;
      paramagnetic beads, which can then be isolated by passage through a magnetized column and&#xD;
      released by agitation of beads. Two conditioning regimens have been used successfully with an&#xD;
      alternative similar system, isolex, which is no longer being manufactured.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      For this trial, patients will be put into one of two myeloablative conditioning regimens,&#xD;
      based on their disease, stage of disease, and dose of radiation accumulated in the course of&#xD;
      treatment. Approximately twenty-four to forty-eight hours after completion of each&#xD;
      conditioning regimen, patients will receive a transplant of a CD34+ progenitor cell-enriched,&#xD;
      T-cell depleted fraction of GCSF-mobilized PBSC after fractionation on the CliniMACS device,&#xD;
      from his/her HLA compatible donor. Due to stringent T-cell depletion, no significant&#xD;
      Graft-versus-host disease is anticipated. Should Graft-versus-host disease occur, standard&#xD;
      treatment would be initiated per the Transplant Service guidelines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this trial is to evaluate the potential of T-cell depleted Haploidentical Stem&#xD;
      Cell Transplant fractionated by the CliniMACS system, when administered for disease targeted&#xD;
      cytoreductive regimens, to secure consistent engraftment and hematopoietic reconstitution in&#xD;
      HLA-compatible related or unrelated hosts, and to prevent or abrogate acute and chronic forms&#xD;
      of Graft-versus-host disease. This study seeks to validate that these pre-transplant&#xD;
      conditioning regimens, when administered with a CD34+ progenitor cell enriched, T-cell&#xD;
      depleted graft, fractionated in the CliniMACS system, will be associated with a low incidence&#xD;
      of non-leukemic mortality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size is as follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Regimen A: Hyperfractionated Total Body Irradiation/Thiotepa/Cyclophosphamide: 100 patients&#xD;
      Regimen B: Busulfan/Melphalan/Fludarabine: 100 patients It is anticipated that the accrual&#xD;
      will last five years. Patients will be followed for two years following transplantation.&#xD;
