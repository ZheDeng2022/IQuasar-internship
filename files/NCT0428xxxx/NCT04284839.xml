      The DANCE Trial is a multi-centre, randomized controlled trial comparing the safety of direct&#xD;
      oral anticoagulants (DOAC) versus vitamin K antagonists (VKA) in the early period (30 days)&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery in patients with an indication for oral anticoagulation.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Approximately 36,000 Canadian adults undergo cardiac surgery annually. Of these patients,&#xD;
      about 10% have a prior history of atrial fibrillation (AF). In the early post-operative&#xD;
      period after cardiac surgery, 30-60% of patients develop AF and, by the time of discharge,&#xD;
      32% of patients who underwent cardiac surgery have an indication for oral anticoagulation&#xD;
      (OAC). AF is associated with a significantly higher risk of stroke, even when transient, and&#xD;
      OAC is the standard for thromboembolic prevention in these patients. In the post-operative&#xD;
      period, the balance of benefits and risks of OAC may differ and the safest and most effective&#xD;
      OAC in that patient population is uncertain.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), such as warfarin or coumadin, are the most used anticoagulants&#xD;
      after cardiac surgery. In the Left Atrial Appendage Occlusion Study (LAAOS) III, 77% of&#xD;
      patients with AF on OAC were discharged on a VKA after cardiac surgery with 55% of the&#xD;
      patients presenting on a direct oral anticoagulant (DOAC) being switched to a VKA! Although&#xD;
      effective, their use is limited by a narrow therapeutic index requiring frequent&#xD;
      international normalized ratio (INR) measurements to ensure appropriate levels of&#xD;
      anticoagulation. This key limitation leads to non-compliance and discontinuation. In&#xD;
      addition, in the first 3 months after cardiac surgery, time in the therapeutic range is low,&#xD;
      even with close monitoring by experienced prescribers.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the last decade, DOACs - inhibitors of factor Xa or thrombin- have become broadly used in&#xD;
      patients with AF. Treatment with a DOAC in patients with AF has been demonstrated to yield a&#xD;
      lower risk of stroke or systemic embolism and a similar risk of major bleeding when compared&#xD;
      to VKAs during long-term follow-up. Moreover, DOACs are more convenient for both patients and&#xD;
      clinicians. They have a rapid onset of effect, fixed dosage that obviates the need for&#xD;
      regular monitoring, and few interactions with food and other medications. In the&#xD;
      postoperative setting, DOACs may also lead to shorter length of stay and reduced costs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to establish whether DOACs are as safe as VKAs in the first few&#xD;
      weeks after heart surgery. The results of this study will impact the treatment of hundreds of&#xD;
      thousands of patients in the world every year.&#xD;
