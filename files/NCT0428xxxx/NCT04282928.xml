  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Viral pneumonia is an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by respiratory viruses. It&#xD;
      is mainly caused by the invasion of respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and&#xD;
      adenovirus into the lower respiratory tract. Every winter and spring is the epidemic season.&#xD;
      Influenza virus and adenovirus have high infectivity and pathogenicity. The rapid progress of&#xD;
      some patients may be caused by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) or multiple organ&#xD;
      dysfunction And died of complications. The fatality rate of severe patients is 9.8% - 60%.&#xD;
      Most of the dead cases were the elderly and the patients with basic diseases. In addition to&#xD;
      the complications, the main cause of death is ARDS caused by virus infection, on the other&#xD;
      hand, the basic immune function of the elderly is poor, so it is difficult to form an&#xD;
      effective antiviral response in response to virus infection. The direct destruction of the&#xD;
      alveolar epithelial barrier and the systemic inflammatory response induced by the infection,&#xD;
      namely, the destruction of the alveolar capillary barrier by the inflammatory waterfall, are&#xD;
      the important pathogenesis of ARDS. How to effectively regulate the inflammatory response,&#xD;
      prevent the inflammatory exudation and edema of the lungs, improve oxygenation, and reduce&#xD;
      organ damage; at the same time, how to effectively improve the basic immune function and&#xD;
      enhance the anti-virus immune response of such patients, has become the key to the success of&#xD;
      the treatment of patients with severe viral pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (UC-MSCs) can differentiate into the different germ&#xD;
      layers and play an important role in immune regulation and damage repair regulation. Clinical&#xD;
      trials have shown that MSC is safe and effective in the treatment of acute lung injury and&#xD;
      pulmonary fibrosis, and it can improve the immune function of patients with viral infectious&#xD;
      diseases. Hence, intravenous infusion of HUC-MSCs is attractive therapy against severe viral&#xD;
      pneumonia.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a randomized, singlecenter, open lable, intervention controlled clinical trial. The&#xD;
      participants (n = 40) will be randomly distributed into two groups. The routine treatment&#xD;
      group (n = 20) will receive the treatment according to &quot;Influenza diagnosis and treatment&#xD;
      plan (2019 version)&quot;, the HUC-MSCs adjuvant Group (n = 20) will receive intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of definitive HUC-MSCs (1×10^6 cells/Kg × body weight(kg), which was selected by&#xD;
      immunomodulatory assay through coculture with BV2 cell) on the basis of the routine treatment&#xD;
      once at day 1 after joining. Follow-up duration is 90 days. The difference of 90 day&#xD;
      mortality and average length of stay between the two groups will be observed and recorded.&#xD;
      The changes of inflammatory index, viral load, oxygenation index and pulmonary imaging will&#xD;
      be monitored at different time points after treatment in the two groups. The serious adverse&#xD;
      events (SAEs) and adverse events (AEs) will be observed during the period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The intent of this study is to explore the efficacy of HUC-MSCs in the treatment of severe&#xD;
      viral pneumonia through improving the antiviral immune response of patients, reduce the lung&#xD;
      inflammatory damage caused by the virus and the pulmonary interstitial fibrosis after the&#xD;
      injury, and finally achieve the goal of reducing the mortality and improving the prognosis of&#xD;
      severe patients, and to evaluate the safety.&#xD;
