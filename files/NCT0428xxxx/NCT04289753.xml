  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Investigators will evaluate clinical decision support nudges informed by behavioral science&#xD;
      and directed at primary care clinicians. These will be used to reduce commonly misused, and&#xD;
      potentially harmful, diagnostic and therapeutic actions that occur in the care of older&#xD;
      adults (e.g. overtreatment of type 2 diabetes, misuse of PSA screening, misuse of urine&#xD;
      testing in women with nonspecific symptoms or no symptoms.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Diagnostic and therapeutic strategies misapplied to older adults can lead to increased&#xD;
      morbidity and mortality. Despite recommendations from the American Geriatrics Society for the&#xD;
      Choosing Wisely Initiative, there are clear examples where clinicians do not often follow&#xD;
      best practices leading to patient harm. These include: (1) testing and treatment for&#xD;
      asymptomatic bacteriuria (ASB) in older women, (2) prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening&#xD;
      in older men, and (3) aggressive treatment with insulin or oral hypoglycemics for type 2&#xD;
      diabetes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical decision support nudges, informed by behavioral economics and social psychology and&#xD;
      delivered via electronic health records (EHRs), are promising strategies to reduce the misuse&#xD;
      of services. Behavioral economics-informed interventions influence conscious and unconscious&#xD;
      drivers of decision making, are low cost, and can be incorporated into existing systems.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This randomized controlled trial will evaluate the effects of three clinical decision support&#xD;
      nudges on three clinical quality measures, indicators of patient safety, and clinician&#xD;
      attitudes.&#xD;
