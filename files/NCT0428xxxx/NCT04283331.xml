      Compared to laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), Photorefractive Keratectomy (PRK)&#xD;
      is associated with more discomfort and requires more downtime. However, it is oftentimes&#xD;
      considered the preferred method of refractive surgery for patients with dry eye syndrome,&#xD;
      high refractive errors, thin corneas, or those with more active lifestyles who may be more&#xD;
      prone to dislodging their LASIK flaps. We hypothesize that the use of bandage contact lenses&#xD;
      soaked in proparacaine will decrease pain levels compared to solely the use of bandage&#xD;
      contact lenses after PRK.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) is a popular method for the correction of refractive&#xD;
      errors. Compared to laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis (LASIK), PRK is often associated&#xD;
      with more discomfort and requires more downtime. However, it is oftentimes considered the&#xD;
      preferred method of refractive surgery for patients with dry eye syndrome, high refractive&#xD;
      errors, thin corneas, or those with more active lifestyles who may be more prone to&#xD;
      dislodging their LASIK flaps. It can also avoid other complications associated with LASIK&#xD;
      including striae, folds, diffuse lamellar keratitis, and epithelial ingrowth. As a result,&#xD;
      improved management of post-operative pain in patients undergoing PRK is critical in order&#xD;
      encourage utilization and patient preference of this procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current standard of care for pain management after PRK is the use of a bandage soft&#xD;
      contact lens (BSCL). BSCLs may speed reepithelialization and function as an adjunct for pain&#xD;
      control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a BSCL soaked in proparacaine has not yet been studied as a pain management method&#xD;
      after PRK. Our hypothesis is that combining these two methods will result in greater pain&#xD;
      reduction than using a BSCL alone, which is the current standard of care. Furthermore,&#xD;
      soaking the BSCL in anesthetics will reduce the chance that patients can abuse anesthetic&#xD;
      medication postoperatively, which is the concern when patients are sent home with anesthetic&#xD;
      drops as is noted in several prior studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to explore the potential of an anesthetic soaked bandage soft contact lens in&#xD;
      reducing pain levels compared to a bandage soft contact lens alone after PRK.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Goals:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the perception of pain following photorefractive keratectomy with the&#xD;
           utilization of an anesthetic soaked bandage soft contact lens versus control (BSCL only)&#xD;
           using the Visual Analog Pain Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To assess the effect of an anesthetic soaked bandage soft contact lens on&#xD;
           re-epithelialization following photorefractive keratectomy versus control. This will be&#xD;
           assessed on post-operative day 5 as whether there is a persistent epithelial defect or&#xD;
           not, a binary outcome.&#xD;

    <description>Primary Outcome Measure is pain score at post-operative day 0 THROUGH post-operative day 5. Patients will be asked to fill out their score daily.&#xD;
The Wong-Baker Faces pain scale will be used to measure pain. This is a self-report measure of pain consisting of a series of faces with expressions of increasing distress. Each face is also given a numerical rating from 0 to 5, zero representing no pain and 5 representing worst pain.</description>
