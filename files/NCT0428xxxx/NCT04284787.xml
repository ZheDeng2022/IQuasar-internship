    <textblock>
      This phase II trial studies how well azacitidine and venetoclax chemotherapy with or without&#xD;
      pembrolizumab work in treating older patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia.&#xD;
      Chemotherapy drugs, such as azacitidine and venetoclax, work in different ways to stop the&#xD;
      growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by&#xD;
      stopping them from spreading. Immunotherapy with monoclonal antibodies, such as&#xD;
      pembrolizumab, may help the body's immune system attack the cancer, and may interfere with&#xD;
      the ability of tumor cells to grow and spread. Giving azacitidine and venetoclax chemotherapy&#xD;
      with pembrolizumab may increase the rate of deeper/better responses and reduce the chance of&#xD;
      the leukemia coming back in patients with newly diagnosed acute myeloid leukemia compared to&#xD;
      conventional therapy of azacitidine and venetoclax alone.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the percentage of patients with minimal residual disease (MRD) negative complete&#xD;
      remission (CR) (MRD-CR) or complete remission with incomplete count recovery (MRD-CRi) with&#xD;
      azacitadine (AZA) + venetoclax (VEN) with pembrolizumab during the first 6 cycles and compare&#xD;
      to control arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Assess the investigator-assessed rates of CR/CRi/partial remission (PR)/morphological&#xD;
      leukemia free state (MLFS) as defined per the modified International Working Group (IWG) 2003&#xD;
      response criteria with AZA + VEN with pembrolizumab, as well as rates of MRD negative MLFS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Rates of complete remission with partial count recovery (CRh) and hematologic improvement&#xD;
      (HI) to red blood cells and platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Assess time to MRD negativity and duration of MRD negative state, event free survival&#xD;
      (EFS), relapse free survival (RFS), calculated as the time from initial treatment to either&#xD;
      disease relapse or death, duration of response (DOR, defined as the time from first CR/CRi to&#xD;
      the date of the first documented relapse or death, whichever occurs first) and overall&#xD;
      survival (OS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Assess the proportion of patients who develop severe toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. MRD assessment by duplex sequencing (DS) and comparing DS and multiparameter flow&#xD;
      cytometry for MRD detection as an exploratory biomarker.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Assessment of immune-checkpoint expression and dynamic change of immune cell subsets in&#xD;
      response to the combination of checkpoint-inhibition and backbone combination in acute&#xD;
      myeloid leukemia (AML).&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. High-throughput sequencing of the T-cell receptor (TCR) Vb CDR3 regions on ï¬‚ow&#xD;
      cytometrically sorted t-cell subsets to assess the effect of immunotherapy on the diversity&#xD;
      of the t-cell repertoire and assess for correlation to clinical outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. Investigation of protein signatures and ribonucleic acid (RNA) signatures associated with&#xD;
      response and efficacy using O-link cytokine panel and RNA-sequencing (seq), respectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      V. Determination of mutational load by whole exome sequencing to assess for correlation with&#xD;
      clinical outcomes, immune infiltrating profile, and T cell repertoire diversity and&#xD;
      clonality.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VI. Profiling of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) methylation patterns before and after treatment&#xD;
      to assess for correlation to response to treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VII. Correlate gut microbiome at baseline and changes in the microbiome with clinical&#xD;
      response, both in standard chemotherapy and immunotherapy/chemotherapy therapy settings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      VIII. MRD assessment using duplex sequencing strategy for circulating cell-free tumor DNA and&#xD;
      correlation with long-term outcomes.&#xD;
&#xD;

      ARM I (AZA + VEN):&#xD;
&#xD;
      INDUCTION THERAPY PHASE: Patients receive azacitadine intravenously (IV) over 10-40 minutes&#xD;
      or subcutaneously (SC) on days 1-7 and venetoclax orally (PO) on days 1-28 of cycle 1 and&#xD;
      days 1-21 or 1-28 of subsequent cycles. Treatment repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in&#xD;

             eligible&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with core binding factor (CBF)-AML and acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Received a prior anti-cancer monoclonal antibodies (mAb) within 4 weeks prior to study&#xD;
             registration or have not recovered (recovery defined as baseline or =&lt; grade 1) from&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Prior therapy with an anti-PD-1, anti-PD-L1, or anti-PD-L2 agent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who have had chemotherapy, targeted small molecule therapy (aside from&#xD;
             imatinib, dasatinib, or nilotinib, hydroxyurea, or all-trans retinoic acid [ATRA]), or&#xD;

             entering the study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Left ventricular ejection fraction &lt; 50% as determined by either echocardiogram or&#xD;
             multi-gated acquisition (MUGA)&#xD;

             residual toxicities &gt; grade 1) with the exception of =&lt; grade 2 neuropathy and&#xD;
             alopecia&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities, not&#xD;
                  require corticosteroids, and not have had radiation pneumonitis. A 1-week washout&#xD;
                  is permitted for palliative radiation (=&lt; 2 weeks of radiotherapy) to non-central&#xD;
                  nervous system (CNS) disease&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients currently participating and receiving study therapy or have participated in a&#xD;
             study of an investigational agent and received study therapy or used an&#xD;
             investigational device within 4 weeks of the first dose of treatment are ineligible&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  History of hypersensitivity to pembrolizumab (MK-3475) or any of its excipients, or&#xD;
             other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current use of systemic corticosteroids or immunosuppressive agents&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  EXCEPTION: Low doses of steroids (e.g., &lt; 0.5 mg/kg/day, absolute maximum 40&#xD;
                  mg/day of prednisone or equivalent dose of other steroid), inhaled&#xD;
                  corticosteroids, or topical steroids are permitted&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Other active primary malignancy (other than non-melanomatous skin cancer or carcinoma&#xD;
             in situ of the cervix) requiring treatment or limiting expected survival to =&lt; 2 years&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: If there is a history of prior malignancy, they must not be receiving other&#xD;
                  specific treatment (other than hormonal therapy for their cancer)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with known active CNS disease and/or carcinomatous meningitis. Assessment of&#xD;
             the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is not required to enroll in the study unless there is&#xD;
             clinical suspicion for CNS involvement. However, if CSF assessment is performed for&#xD;
             any reason, there should be no evidence of active leukemia in the CSF. Subjects with&#xD;
             previously treated brain metastases may participate provided they are stable (without&#xD;
             evidence of progression by imaging for at least four weeks prior to the first dose of&#xD;
             protocol treatment and any neurologic symptoms have returned to baseline), have no&#xD;
             evidence of new or enlarging brain metastases, and are not using steroids for at least&#xD;
             7 days prior to protocol treatment. This exception does not include carcinomatous&#xD;
             meningitis which is excluded regardless of clinical stability&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received prior allogenic transplant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a history or current evidence of any condition, therapy, or laboratory&#xD;
             abnormality that might confound the results of the trial, interfere with the subject's&#xD;
             participation for the full duration of the trial, or is not in the best interest of&#xD;
             the subject to participate, in the opinion of the treating investigator&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a diagnosis of immunodeficiency or receiving high dose systemic steroid&#xD;
             therapy or any other form of immunosuppressive therapy within 7 days prior to the&#xD;
             first dose of treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with active autoimmune disease except for patients with hypothyroidism and&#xD;
             vitiligo that has required systemic treatment in the past 2 years (i.e., with use of&#xD;
             disease modifying agents, corticosteroids or immunosuppressive drugs). Replacement&#xD;
             therapy (e.g., thyroxine, insulin, or physiologic corticosteroid replacement therapy&#xD;
             for adrenal or pituitary insufficiency, etc.) is not considered a form of systemic&#xD;
             treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a known history of non-infectious pneumonitis that required the use of&#xD;
             steroids or current pneumonitis&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with active uncontrolled infection&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patient with a known history of active TB (Bacillus tuberculosis)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with&#xD;
             study requirements&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pregnant women are excluded from this study because pembrolizumab (MK-3475) is&#xD;
             humanized antibody with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects.&#xD;
             Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants&#xD;
             secondary to treatment of the mother with pembrolizumab (MK-3475), breastfeeding&#xD;
             should be discontinued if the mother is treated with pembrolizumab (MK-3475). These&#xD;
             potential risks may also apply to other agents used in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with no bone marrow involvement (i.e., those with only extramedullary&#xD;
             disease)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients who received prior hypomethylating agent (HMA) therapy for antecedent MDS&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients that received a live vaccine within 30 days of planned start of study therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  NOTE: Seasonal influenza vaccines for injection are generally inactivated flu&#xD;
                  vaccines and are allowed; however intranasal influenza vaccines (e.g., Flu-Mist)&#xD;
                  are live attenuated vaccines, and are not allowed&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with active hemolytic anemia requiring immunosuppressive therapy or other&#xD;
             pharmacologic treatment. Patients who have a positive Coombs test but no evidence of&#xD;
             hemolysis are NOT excluded from participation&#xD;
