      This is an one-year open-label study to determine treatment efficacy and feasibility of a&#xD;
      trial that uses open-label interventions in ADPKD patients.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Polycystic Kidney Disease (PKD) is the most common genetic disease leading to End Stage&#xD;
      Kidney Disease (ESKD), affecting between 1 in 500-1000 individuals from every ethnic group.&#xD;
      The autosomal dominant (ADPKD) form arises from a two-hit downregulation of proteins encoded&#xD;
      by either PKD1 or PKD2. Although many potential therapies have been studied to slow&#xD;
      progression of ADPKD, none to date have been proven to be both safe and effective in slowing&#xD;
      disease progression. Cholesterol-lowering agents called statins have shown promise in the&#xD;
      treatment of younger ADPKD patients, reducing inflammation and progression as assessed by&#xD;
      kidney growth, but their utility appears to be limited in older populations and those with&#xD;
      more advanced chronic kidney disease (CKD). Recent evidence suggests that acidosis, as often&#xD;
      seen in patients with worsening CKD and which may enhance CKD progression, limits the&#xD;
      effectiveness of statins and enhances their potential toxicity. The investigators thus&#xD;
      hypothesize that correction of acidosis along with statin treatment will be a safe and&#xD;
      effective therapeutic regimen to slow CKD progression in the adult ADPKD population and&#xD;
      improve overall quality of life in these patients. To test this hypothesis, the investigators&#xD;
      will conduct a pilot open-label randomized clinical trial in ADPKD patients with estimated&#xD;
      GFR &gt;45 min (Stage 1-3a CKD) comparing three treatment groups: control, pravastatin (40 mg po&#xD;
      qd), and pravastatin plus sodium citrate solution (30 mL po total daily dose) over one year.&#xD;
      During the study period, through study visits along with serial blood draws and urinary&#xD;
      measurements, the investigators will evaluate safety and tolerability of these treatment&#xD;
      regimens, follow renal function and investigate the role of these treatments on acidosis,&#xD;
      inflammatory and metabolic biomarkers in patients enrolled at an outpatient facility. This&#xD;
      study will establish the framework for larger clinical trials in ADPKD. Moreover, if the&#xD;
      results of this study suggest safety/tolerability or potential benefits of statins and alkali&#xD;
      therapy in this ADPKD population, the investigators will seek extramural funding for a larger&#xD;
      clinical trial to test this therapeutic strategy in ADPKD.&#xD;

    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patient voluntarily gives informed consent to participate in the study and signed&#xD;
             study's IC and HIPAA.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Patient is age 18 or older at the time of consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. If applicable, female of reproductive potential (Females who are successfully&#xD;
             sterilized (surgical sterilization methods include hysterectomy, bilateral tubal&#xD;
             ligation, or bilateral oophorectomy) or are postmenopausal (defined as amenorrhea for&#xD;
             at least 12 consecutive months) are not considered to be of reproductive potential)&#xD;
             must be non-pregnant (as confirmed by a urine pregnancy test at screening) and&#xD;
             non-lactating, and agree:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Either abstain from intercourse (when it is in line with their preferred and&#xD;
                  usual lifestyle), or&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. Use 2 medically acceptable, highly-effective forms of contraception for the&#xD;
                  duration of study, and at least 30 days after discontinuing study drug&#xD;
                  (highly-effective forms of contraception can include approved hormonal&#xD;
                  contraceptives (oral, injectable, and implantable), and barrier methods (such as&#xD;
                  a condom or diaphragm) when used with a spermicide.))&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients has ADPKD diagnosed by unified criteria using a combination of ultrasound&#xD;
             results, genotyping and MRI as needed (1, 2). Kidney ultrasound is usually used for&#xD;
             screening because it is safe, effective, and inexpensive. Diagnostic criteria are&#xD;
             based upon whether the genotype is known. Disease severity varies between the&#xD;
             different genotypes. The great majority of patients at risk for ADPKD are from&#xD;
             families with an unknown genotype. This diagnosis will take place prior to recruitment&#xD;
             / inclusion into the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
             The following ultrasonographic criteria for the diagnosis of ADPKD are for at-risk&#xD;
             patients from families of where the genotype is not known:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. If the patient is between 18 and 39 years of age, at least three unilateral or&#xD;
                  bilateral kidney cysts. The specificity and positive predictive value at this&#xD;
                  age-range is 100 percent. (sensitivity of 82 and 96 percent for individuals&#xD;
                  between 15 and 29 years and between 30 to 39 years of age, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
               2. If the patient is 40 to 59 years of age, at least two cysts in each kidney&#xD;
                  (sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive value of 90, 100, and 100&#xD;
                  percent, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
               3. Among individuals 60 years or older, at least four cysts in each kidney. (100&#xD;
                  percent sensitivity and specificity).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. The above patients with estimated GFR ≥30 ml/min i.e. with stage 1-3b CKD&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Plasma bicarbonate ≤ 25 mMol/L&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Metabolic acidosis&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The patient agrees to immediately inform Investigator and research coordinator of any&#xD;
             changes or planned changes in concomitant medication&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Patients with known allergy or sensitive to Pravastatin or NaCitrate&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Acute coronary disease, liver disease, muscle disease, or a history of pulmonary edema&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Creatine Phospho Kinase (CPK) &gt; 2ULN (2.5 ULN in African Americans). Elevated creatine&#xD;
             phosphokinase could be a marker of rhabdomyolysis, which is a potential side effect of&#xD;
             pravastatin. In general, patients with African American ancestry can have higher&#xD;
             normal level of CPK&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients with systemic disease that impacting kidney per Investigator's decision&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Patients with known unstable cerebral aneurysm per Investigator's decision&#xD;

             methods&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Proteinuria &gt; 500 mg/day&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. History of non-compliance of medication per Investigator's decision&#xD;
