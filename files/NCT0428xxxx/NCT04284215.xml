  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Non-resectable stage III non-small cell lung cancer is recommended for concurrent&#xD;
      chemoradiotherapy. Paclitaxel and platinum are commonly used in chemotherapy regimens. The&#xD;
      aim of this study was to investigate whether paclitaxel albumin combined with cisplatin&#xD;
      combined with three-dimensional primary radiotherapy could improve short-term efficacy, local&#xD;
      progression-free survival, and reduce treatment-related toxicity. To determine whether&#xD;
      paclitaxel albumin combined with cisplatin regimen can be used as a first-line treatment for&#xD;
      stage III non-small cell lung cancer with concurrent primary thoracic radiotherapy&#xD;

      Control group: Paclitaxel 175 mg/m2 was injected into saline solution on the first day.&#xD;
      Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 was given intravenously for 2-3 days (2-4 days), carboplatin 300 mg/m2 and&#xD;
      2 days. (Because toxicity and heart problems can replace DDP)]Repeated every 3-4 weeks for 4&#xD;
      consecutive cycles (21-28 days/cycle, minimum 2 cycles). In the experimental group, albumin&#xD;
      paclitaxel 40 mg/m2/week was injected into saline at the same time as radiotherapy, once a&#xD;
      week. Cisplatin 75 mg/m2 was given intravenously for 2-3 days (2-4 days), carboplatin 300&#xD;
      mg/m2 and 2 days. (Because toxicity and heart problems can replace DDP)] Repeat every 3-4&#xD;
      weeks for 4 consecutive cycles (21-28 days/cycle, minimum 2 cycles). Three-dimensional&#xD;
      radiotherapy: intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or rotational intensity-modulated&#xD;
      radiation therapy (VMAT) segmented dose: primary focus and mediastinal metastatic lymph&#xD;
      nodes; segmented mode: continuous accelerated hypersegmentation Dose: DTGTV: &gt; 60Gy treatment&#xD;
      sequence: Chemotherapy started within one week after completion of pre-treatment evaluation.&#xD;
      Radiotherapy for primary thoracic tumors was performed simultaneously on the first day of&#xD;
      chemotherapy. Chemotherapy effectiveness was evaluated by radiological examination within one&#xD;
      week after the completion of the second cycle of chemotherapy.&#xD;
