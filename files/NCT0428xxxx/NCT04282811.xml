      Observational study aimed at describing the characteristics and outcome of CLL patients who&#xD;
      started treatment with venetoclax-based regimens according to the local label outside&#xD;
      clinical trials in Italy in a period of time ranging from the start of the Venetoclax Named&#xD;
      Patient Program (March 2016) until October 31st, 2021.&#xD;

      A longitudinal survey will be carried out by collecting data of patients who received at&#xD;
      least 1 dose of venetoclax. The study includes two different groups: a retrospective group&#xD;
      (all patients who have received at least one dose of venetoclax before enrolment) and a&#xD;
      prospective group (patients receiving treatment with venetoclax after enrolment). All&#xD;
      patients in both groups will be observed for up to 48 months from the treatment start. In the&#xD;
      prospective cohort only, QoL will be assessed at the time of study entry (i.e. baseline) and&#xD;
      thereafter at 3, 6, 9, 12, 18 24, 30, 36, 42 and 48 months of follow-up and at treatment&#xD;
      discontinuation (due to any cause).&#xD;
