    <textblock>
      Tumor mutational burden (TMB) seems to be is an important marker for immune checkpoint&#xD;
      inhibitors efficacy. This study aims to assess the feasibility of the TMB assessment in&#xD;
      first-line lung cancer in routine practice both on biopsy and surgical tumor samples. Results&#xD;
      will be an element of discussion for the generalization of the TMB implementation in cancer&#xD;
      centers.&#xD;

      1. Current knowledge about the field under investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Clinical evidence demonstrates that treatment with immune checkpoint blocker (ICB)&#xD;
           agents benefit to patients across multiple tumor type. However, development of&#xD;
           predictive biomarkers is needed to identify patients who are most likely to respond to&#xD;
           immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
           An emerging biomarker for response to immunotherapy is the total number of mutations&#xD;
           present in a tumor specimen. This biomarker is named mutation load or tumor mutational&#xD;
           burden (TMB). It is hypothesized that highly mutated tumors are more likely to harbor&#xD;
           neoantigens targeted by activated immune cells. This metric, allowed by recent advances&#xD;
           in next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, notably whole-exome sequencing (WES)&#xD;
           and RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq), has been shown, in several tumor types, to correlate with&#xD;
           patient response to ICB. Indeed, the TMB has been correlated with clinical benefits of&#xD;
           anti-PD-1 and anti-CTLA-4 therapy in various tumor types, including malignant melanoma&#xD;
           (Snyder et al., 2014; Van Allen et al., 2015) with a threshold of more than 100&#xD;
           nonsynonymous single-nucleotide variants (nsSNV) per exome, non-small cell lung cancers&#xD;
           (NSCLC) (Rizvi et al., 2015) with a threshold defined as superior to 178 nsSNVs per&#xD;
           exome, and several DNA repair-deficient tumors (Howitt et al., 2015; Le et al., 2015,&#xD;
           2017). A recent study prospectively confirmed that the PFS among patients with a high&#xD;
           tumor mutational burden was significantly longer with nivolumab plus ipilimumab than&#xD;
           with chemotherapy in NSCLC (Hellmann et al., 2018). Overall, a direct link between DNA&#xD;
           repair deficiency, mutational landscape, predicted neoantigen load, and clinical&#xD;
           activity of ICB is suggested.&#xD;
&#xD;
           TMB was defined as the number of somatic, coding, base substitution, and indel mutations&#xD;
           per megabase of genome examined. All base substitutions and indels in the coding region&#xD;
           of targeted genes. It has been shown that TMB calculated using cancer gene panel (CGP)&#xD;
           assay agrees well with whole exome measures of mutation burden (Chalmers et al., 2017).&#xD;
           This indicates that CGP, targeting the entire coding region of several hundred genes,&#xD;
           covers sufficient genomic size to accurately assess WES mutational burden. It was found&#xD;
           that filtering out germline alterations and rare variants was important to obtaining&#xD;
           accurate measurements of TMB, and this will especially be important in patients from&#xD;
           ethnic backgrounds not well represented in sequencing datasets. These findings indicate&#xD;
           that CGP is an accurate, cost-effective, and clinically available tool for measuring&#xD;
           TMB. The results of down sampling analysis show that the variation in measurement due to&#xD;
           sampling when sequencing 1.1 Mb is acceptably low, resulting in highly accurate calling&#xD;
           of TMB at a range of TMB levels. This sampling variation increases as the number of&#xD;
           megabases sequenced decreases, especially at lower levels of TMB. While targeted CGP can&#xD;
           be used to accurately assess TMB, it is not currently suited for identification of&#xD;
           neoantigens, which might occur in any gene. Nevertheless, the theragnostic impact of TMB&#xD;
           has been also determined with a targeted CGP by the FoundationOne CDx assay (Hellmann et&#xD;
           al., 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The failure to assess the TMB may occur at different steps in the analytical process. It&#xD;
           can be at the sample acquisition with a low level of DNA (5-10%). The NGS processing&#xD;
           depending on the method can lead to a process failure around 2-3%. And finally, the&#xD;
           bioinformatic curation will lead to a 3-5% of failure. At the end, the TMB will be&#xD;
           undetermined with an attrition rate at 15% of the samples (Fondation Medicine Personal&#xD;
           communication).&#xD;
&#xD;
           The implementation of tumor mutational burden assessment in a nation-wide perspective is&#xD;
           challenging and large efforts should be done. Whatever the method, WES or large CGP, the&#xD;
           measurements of TMB will change the scale of gene sequencing in the molecular platforms.&#xD;
&#xD;
           It is important that the platforms, where the tumor mutational burden measurement will&#xD;
           be implemented can be able to calibrate their CGP and compared it to a standard&#xD;
           reference for the measurement of TMB. Moreover, with the limited quantity of DNA, the&#xD;
           implemented method needs to produce reliable result for most of the samples. The&#xD;
           platforms need also to deploy their wet benches processes and their bioinformatics&#xD;
           pipeline to be able to produce the TMB in a turnaround time compatible with clinical&#xD;
           patients management.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Description of the population of study participants and justification for the choice of&#xD;
           participants&#xD;
&#xD;
           As mentioned above the TMB seems to be is an important marker for ICB efficacy. It is&#xD;
           therefore important to implement the TMB measurement at a nationwide level to assure the&#xD;
           equal access to the ICB.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The French National Cancer Institute (INCa) has labelled molecular platforms which are&#xD;
           in charge of the different molecular tests should establish their processes to be able&#xD;
           to face to this new test. This study is designated to test different CGP methods to&#xD;
           assess tumor mutational burden in lung cancers in order to compare the different methods&#xD;
           and to identify the drawbacks and failures of the different methods. Results of this&#xD;
           study should allow to estimate the needs for the implementation of TMB at the nationwide&#xD;
           level, recommend cancer gene panels, propose validated bioinformatics pipelines and&#xD;
           finally recommend preanalytical processes for reducing the failure rate of the tests.&#xD;
&#xD;
           For this purpose this study will determine the TMB on patients with a lung cancer. 200&#xD;
           patients with a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and naive of treatment will be&#xD;
           recruited.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Three cohorts will be recruited:&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  100 patients will be included without resection and we will determine the TMB on&#xD;
                the biopsy specimen&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  100 patients will be included after surgical resection of their tumor and we will&#xD;
                determine the TMB on the resected specimen&#xD;
&#xD;
                  -  Within this cohort, TMB will be assessed both on the biopsy specimen and on&#xD;
                     the resected specimen for 20 patients 200 patients will be enrolled in order&#xD;
                     to perform 220 TMB analysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Participating sites are large platforms which were selected on the basis of their&#xD;
           capacity to implement new tests and which have all facilities for conducting the&#xD;
           described research. The patients included in this study will correspond to those that&#xD;
           will receive immune checkpoint inhibitors during the course of their disease. This study&#xD;
           in a non-interventional study, as it will not modify the clinical care of the patients.&#xD;
           The tissue sampling will be taken during clinical procedure needed for patient care. The&#xD;
           study will be proposed to patients after the verification that tissues have been&#xD;
           collected in a way that is compatible with the present study. Only tumor material and no&#xD;
           germline DNA will be collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Selected patients will be close to those that receive ICB and the target population will&#xD;
           be enriched with patients who had been surgically resected, in order to be able to have&#xD;
           enough tissues to compare in these samples different methods to assess TMB and also to&#xD;
           compare pre surgical biopsies and surgical specimen.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Description of the element or elements under investigation&#xD;
&#xD;
      Elements under investigation are the TMB of NSCLC patients. The attrition rate (number of&#xD;
      cases without result) in the TMB estimation will be assessed. The gold standard for the&#xD;
      determination of TMB is the WES as it covers all coding regions. Several others Cancer Gene&#xD;
      Panel methods (CGP) have been described based on cancer gene panels sequencing. The CGP&#xD;
      included in this study will be the panel from Illumina (TS500), Thermofisher (Oncomine Tumor&#xD;
      Mutation Load Assay), home-made panel with Agilent technology (Dedicated XT HS) and&#xD;
      Foundation medicine F1 CDx. It is recognized that size of the cancer gene panels should be&#xD;
      close to 1Mb to be able to measure reliably the TMB in different type of cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Different methods of measurement of TMB will be compared in this series on NSCLC in order to&#xD;
      validate different CGP available on the market or in the different INCa platforms.&#xD;
      Bioinformatics modelling will try to correlate the TMB results from WES and CGP. For this&#xD;
      purpose, based on results of mutational load calculated from results of WES, results of&#xD;
      mutation load will be extrapolated based on a random selection of 1000 genes repeated 1000&#xD;
      times. The mean of the correlation coefficient (R2) between the tumor mutational burden&#xD;
      calculated by the whole exome sequencing and by the different random gene panels is 0.88 IQR&#xD;
      [0.84-0.91] showing that the selection of genes to estimate the TMB should be evaluated&#xD;
      carefully before to be used in clinical practice (unpublished results). The material that&#xD;
      will be collected during the study will allow to determine the performance of the CGP&#xD;
      implemented in the molecular biology platforms.&#xD;
