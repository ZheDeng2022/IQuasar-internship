    <textblock>
      Rationale: Foods that can be eaten at a fast rate - with low mastication effort - lead to&#xD;
      shorter orosensory exposure (OSE) per unit of food consumed. This results in a decreased&#xD;
      satiation response and higher subsequent food intake. Recent research has shown that&#xD;
      participants on a ultra-processed diet have an higher caloric intake and gain body weight&#xD;
      compared to those on an unprocessed food diet. In this study the ultra-processed vs.&#xD;
      unprocessed meals were classified according to the NOVA classification and matched on caloric&#xD;
      content and palatability. The NOVA classification, classifies foods based on the physical,&#xD;
      biological and chemical processes that occur after foods are separated from nature, and&#xD;
      before they are consumed or used in the preparation of dishes and meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, it remains unclear whether the found increase in food intake of ultra-processed&#xD;
      foods is due to industrial processing or because of a difference in eating rate at which the&#xD;
      (ultra-)processed foods can be consumed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: The objective of this study is to determine the independent and additive effects&#xD;
      of industrial food processing (according to the NOVA classification) and eating rate on&#xD;
      satiation.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: The study has a 2x2 randomized crossover design. All participants receive 4&#xD;
      treatments and are their own control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Healthy adults (n=60) between 18-55 years old with a BMI between 18.5-27&#xD;
      kg/m2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention: Participants will join 4 test days during which they receive 3 main test meals&#xD;
      (breakfast, lunch, dinner) and in-between meals snacks according to one of the 4 diets. The 4&#xD;
      diets of this study are: 1) unprocessed, slow eating rate 2) unprocessed, fast eating rate 3)&#xD;
      ultra-processed, slow eating rate 4) ultra- processed, fast eating rate. During eating and&#xD;
      before and after eating the weight of the plate will be measured to determine intake.&#xD;
      Additionally, participants will be recorded on video to determine eating behaviour (number of&#xD;
      bites, chews and oral processing duration). The order in which participants will receive the&#xD;
      diets will be randomized. The evening before and during each test day participants will keep&#xD;
      a food and exercise diary.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study outcomes are food intake during the three&#xD;
      main meals and during snack time. Secondary outcomes are, eating behaviour characteristics&#xD;
      measured by video (eating rate (g/min and bites/min), number of chews (chews/bite and&#xD;
      chews/gram), bite size (gram/bite), oral processing duration (seconds), appetite (hunger,&#xD;
      fullness, desire to eat, desire to eat sweet, desire to eat savoury, prospective consumption)&#xD;
      and sensory characteristics (liking (taste + smell), desire to eat the meal, expected&#xD;
      satiation, sweet, savoury, smoothness, chewiness, thickness) of the meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: The risk associated with participation is small and the burden can be considered&#xD;
      as moderate. The knowledge obtained may be used to develop products or strategies that&#xD;
      enhance healthy choices and eating behaviour and consequently help prevent overweight and&#xD;
      obesity. We consider the knowledge obtained and possible implications of this study to&#xD;
      outweigh the individual burden.&#xD;

      1. OBJECTIVE&#xD;
&#xD;
           The objective of this study is to determine the independent and additive effects of&#xD;
           industrial food processing (according to the NOVA classification) and eating rate on&#xD;
           satiation&#xD;
&#xD;
           Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
           We expect that a slow eating rate decreases food intake per main meal and over the&#xD;
           course of the day, independent of industrial processing.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. STUDY DESIGN&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study has a 2x2 randomized crossover design; all participants receive each treatment and&#xD;
      are their own control (within subject effects). See table 1 for an overview of a test day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 4 conditions of this study are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. unprocessed slow eating rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. unprocessed fast eating rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. ultra- processed slow eating rate&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. ultra- processed fast eating rate&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
           Table 1. Study (pre-) day overview. Participants join four test days during which they&#xD;
           eat ad libitum of 3 main test meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) in between meals they&#xD;
           receive snacks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3. STUDY POPULATION&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.1 Population (base)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be recruited from Wageningen and surroundings. Healthy (self-report),&#xD;
      normal to slightly overweight (18.5-30 kg/m2) men and women between 18-55 years old will be&#xD;
      included. Participants have to be able to understand and speak English (self-report), because&#xD;
      of the sensory questionnaire and appetite questionnaire which will be in English and have&#xD;
      difficult direct translations to Dutch. As 90% of the people that show interest in the study&#xD;
      are university students this should not be a problem (i.e. limiting the number of people that&#xD;
      can be included in the study). The BMI range is based on the average BMI in the Netherlands,&#xD;
      which is 25 kg/m2 but around 50% of the Dutch population is overweight. To be able to include&#xD;
      sufficient subjects we therefore choose to widen the BMI range and include people up to a BMI&#xD;
      of 30 kg/m2 (20). Due to the within subject design this will not influence the outcome of the&#xD;
      study, but results will be more generalizable to people with an average weight.&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.2 Inclusion criteria&#xD;
&#xD;
      In order to be eligible to participate in this study, a subject must meet all of the&#xD;
      following inclusion criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Between 18-55 years old at the day of inclusion&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Able to understand and speak English fluently or without difficulty (self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  BMI 18.5-30 kg/m2 - measured by the researchers at the end of information meeting (after&#xD;
           signing informed consent)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Good general health and appetite (F1 questionnaire self-report)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Commonly (5 out of 7 week days) eating three meals a day every day around approximately&#xD;
           the same times. (This is a Self-report question; see F1 questionnaire).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.3 Exclusion criteria&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Followed an energy restricted diet during the last 2 months&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Gained or lost 5 kg of body weight over the last half year&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  High restrained eater according to the Dutch Eating Behaviour Questionnaire (men:&#xD;
           score&gt;2.9)*. * This exclusion criterion will not explicitly be communicated to the&#xD;

&#xD;
        -  Low score (&lt; -1) for liking the test foods on a nine point likert scale based on&#xD;
           pictures of the food items.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Unfamiliar with the test foods (self report).&#xD;
&#xD;
      3.4 Screening during Information meeting&#xD;
&#xD;
      People interested in participating in the study can send an email to the investigator&#xD;
      indicating that they would like to join the study. After that, participants will receive an&#xD;
      invitation for the information meeting and a pdf of the information brochure by email. During&#xD;
      the information meeting prospective participants receive information about the procedure,&#xD;
      design and measurements of the study through an oral presentation. Participants will not be&#xD;
      informed about the study's purpose. Participants will be told that we are interested in&#xD;
      eating behaviour differences between cultures. It will not be explained specifically that the&#xD;
      main interest is the amount eaten during the ad libitum test meals as this may influence the&#xD;
      results. Participants will be informed about the specific parameters of interest when the&#xD;
      study is finished by email. After receiving the information participants are free to sign&#xD;
      their informed consent.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After signing informed consent, participants will be asked to fill in the Dutch Eating&#xD;
      Behaviour Questionnaire (DEBQ: 33 questions) together with other in-exclusion criteria&#xD;
      (health) questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After filling in the questionnaires, participants will be asked to rate liking and&#xD;
      familiarity of the test food meals based on pictures and taste and rate liking of the snacks&#xD;
      on a nine point hedonic and visual analogue scale (VAS). Based on the in- and exclusion&#xD;
      criteria participants are invited for the test days.&#xD;
&#xD;
      4. Sample size&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome of interest is satiation measured through ad libitum intake of test meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on our previous studies that had the same outcome we need to include 60 participants to&#xD;
      be able to find a 10% difference between study treatments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5. Study measures and meals&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 measurements study&#xD;
&#xD;
      During test meals (breakfast, lunch, dinner) participants eat ad libitum of a test meal&#xD;
      according to one of the four conditions ; unprocessed slow eating rate, unprocessed fast&#xD;
      eating rate, ultra-processed slow eating rate, ultra-processed fast eating rate. During the&#xD;
      meal intake will be measured using a weighing scale hidden in a tray and video recordings&#xD;
      will be made to determine eating behavior. Before and after the test meals participants will&#xD;
      be asked to rate sensory and appetite questions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      General Health and well-being questionnaire The general health and well-being questionnaire&#xD;
      of the human nutrition department will be used to ask subjects about their health and&#xD;
      well-being (since their last session) at the start of the test day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appetite, sensory and well-being variables&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participant will answer an appetite questionnaire. They will rate hunger, fullness, thirst,&#xD;
      desire to eat, desire to eat sweet/savoury, and general prospective consumption on a 100-mm&#xD;
      visual analogue scale (VAS) ranging from 'not at all' to 'extremely' with anchors at the&#xD;
      beginning and end of the line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Appetite Factors:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hunger Fullness Desire to eat Desire to eat sweet Desire to eat savoury Prospective&#xD;
      consumption&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition, participants will rate first the sensory/hedonic attributes of the meal on a&#xD;
      100-mm VAS scale ranging from 'not at all' to 'extremely' with anchors at the beginning and&#xD;
      end of the line.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sensory/hedonic characteristics:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asked only before the meal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Expected satiation Desire to eat the meal (visually)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Asked before and after the meal:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Liking smell Liking taste/flavour Desire to eat the meal (based on tasting)&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides these questions we will also let participants indicate their reason to stop eating,&#xD;
      If their reason is not indicated they have to choose the most appropriate one:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I was full&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I got bored with the texture&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I got bored with the flavour&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I got tired chewing&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  I ate the portion I would normally eat&#xD;
&#xD;
      In addition we will ask participants to rate wellbeing parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Nausea&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  General wellbeing&#xD;
&#xD;
      Video recordings&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the ad libitum eating meals participants will be video recorded. A digital camera will&#xD;
      be positioned in front of the subject (face-on) where the lower frame will be in line with&#xD;
      the shoulders, the upper frame wil be above the top of the cranium and the sides at shoulder&#xD;
      width. Participants will be instructed to look straight into the webcam and not to make&#xD;
      excessive head movements. Data will be analysed manually with use of Observer Noldus.&#xD;
      Recordings will be analysed in a random order. Beforehand defined indicators are: number of&#xD;
      bites, total eating duration, eating duration per bite, number of masticatory cycles per&#xD;
      bite. Application of this technique to chewing of gel-like model foods has shown that it is&#xD;
      possible to separate subjects based on their chewing behaviour (28-31). Permission to record&#xD;
      the participant and save and use the video for this study's purpose will be asked on the&#xD;
      informed consent form.&#xD;
&#xD;
      5.1 NOVA classification of unprocessed, processed (culinary), processed and ultra-processed&#xD;
      foods.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Group 1 Unprocessed Group 2 Processed (culinary) Group 3 Processed Group 4 Ultra-processed&#xD;
      Fruit Oils Canned vegetables Soft drinks Leaves Butter Bottled vegetables Packed snacks Stems&#xD;
      Lard Canned legumes Candies/ chocolate Seeds Sugar Bottled legumes Mass produced breads Roots&#xD;
      Salt Fruit in syrup Cookies Meat Tinned fish in oil Pastries Eggs Bacon Cakes Milk Ham&#xD;
      Margarine Fungi Pastrami Sweetened breakfast cereals Algea Smoked fish Fruit yoghurt water&#xD;
      Simple cheeses Energy drinks Freshly baked bread Pre-prepared meat Cheese Pasta/noodles Pizza&#xD;
      Nugget Burgers Hot dogs Sausages Instant soups Dessert&#xD;
&#xD;
      6. Withdrawal of individual subjects Subjects may discontinue the trial at any moment without&#xD;
      the obligation to state the reason for discontinuation. Subjects may be withdrawn from the&#xD;
      study by the principal investigator if they do not comply with the rules and regulations of&#xD;
      the study. Subjects may be withdrawn from the study by the medical supervisor in case of&#xD;
      reported serious adverse events or in case of other medical/social/psychological events as&#xD;
      evaluated by the medical investigator and discussed with the principal investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
      6.1 Replacement of individual subjects after withdrawal A total of 60 participants will be&#xD;
      included and we will aim to have 5 participants on the reserve list to participate if&#xD;
      participants drop-out during the first week of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      7. Incentives Participants do not receive reimbursement for the information meeting as we&#xD;
      expect not to be able to include many of the participants due to the extensive in- and&#xD;
      exclusion criteria. For completing the entire study (four test sessions) participants receive&#xD;
      €100, - euro. Participants receive €20, - reimbursement per session if they drop out of the&#xD;
      study and participants receive an additional €20, - when completing the entire study. The&#xD;
      reimbursement is calculated (+/- 10%) based on guidelines of the Human Nutrition department&#xD;
      of Wageningen University.&#xD;
&#xD;
      8. Handling and storage of data and documents&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the gathered data will be handled confidential through coding, except for the video's&#xD;
      where the participant will be recognizable. All subjects will receive a unique code, and only&#xD;
      the project leader and investigators will have the key. Confidentially will be clearly&#xD;
      communicated to all participants .The personal data will be stored in a digital database on&#xD;
      an intern network which is protected by a personal password. The password is only known by&#xD;
      the investigators. The key to the personal information will be kept until 5 years after the&#xD;
      results of the study are published and is only known by the project leader and coordinating&#xD;
      researcher. All other data will be kept for 15 years after the results of the studie are&#xD;
      published. No names of the participants will be used in the publication of this study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The video recordings will be stored on the W: drive of the department, only the researchers&#xD;
      directly involved in the study are given access to this drive when login on their account&#xD;
      including password. Videos will be labelled with a unique code, not traceable to the&#xD;
      participant, however to obtain mastication parameters it is necessary to have recordings of&#xD;
      the entire head of the participant; therefore video's will not be anonymous. The videos will&#xD;
      be analysed by the project leader, principle investigator and possible research assistant and&#xD;
      or BSc/MSc thesis/internship students but will be handled confidentially. All researchers and&#xD;
      assistant involved in the study will sign a confidentiality form. The videos will be kept for&#xD;
      5 years after the results of the study are published. Permission of the subjects will be&#xD;
      asked to be able to do so, at the informed consent form. Videos will solely be used for the&#xD;
      analysis as described in this protocol. Videos will not be used for presentation purposes&#xD;
      only in case the participant gives verbally and in written permission to do so.&#xD;
