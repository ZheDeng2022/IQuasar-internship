  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The overall purpose of this study is to better understand food reinforcement in infants. The&#xD;
      results of this study should help to further our understanding of how individuals relate to&#xD;
      food and how an enriched environment can change this behavior.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a between subject design with a Music Together intervention group and a&#xD;
      play date active control group. All subjects will complete the orientation and pre-screening&#xD;
      intervention assessment sessions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infant-mother dyads in the Music together group will attend a 6 weekly, 45-minute classes&#xD;
      as a group. Infant-mother dyads will also receive an illustrated songbook with family&#xD;
      activities to practice and enjoy at home along with the CD. The program provides CD with a&#xD;
      collection of songs, rhythm chants, &quot;play-alongs&quot;, tonal and rhythm patterns, which will be&#xD;
      used in classes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All infant-mother dyads in the play date control group will attend 6 weekly, 45-minute&#xD;
      organized play dates as a group. These play dates will be planned and led by DBM research&#xD;
      staff members. Variety of age-appropriate toys (i.e. puzzles, shape sorters, books) will be&#xD;
      provided for the play date. Each family in the play date group will receive a toy from us to&#xD;
      practice and play at home with their baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Families in both groups are asked to report their home practice with the song or toy with&#xD;
      their babies by filling out the Daily Home Practice Survey.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will attend a post-intervention training assessment session at the conclusion of&#xD;
      the 6 week intervention period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Initial email or phone screen:&#xD;
&#xD;
           Upon receiving an inquiry from a prospective participant, the study will be explained.&#xD;
           If the prospective participant has an infant age 9 to 15 months, and she is interested&#xD;
           in joining the study, a verbal consent will be obtained in order to screen for&#xD;
           eligibility criteria. The initial screening questionnaire could be done via phone or&#xD;
           online via Survey Monkey (see Initial Phone Screen/Survey Monkey Questionnaire for&#xD;
           details). The information assessed during the initial screen is recorded in a secure&#xD;
           database that requires a password. The database is used by select members of the&#xD;
           Division of Behavioral Medicine and has been approved for use by previous IRB&#xD;
           committees.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Orientation:&#xD;
&#xD;
           If families meet the initial criteria gathered from the initial screen, qualified&#xD;
           families will be scheduled for an orientation. At the orientation, there will be an&#xD;
           overview of the study. If interested, parents will be asked to review and sign consent&#xD;
           forms. Two copies of the consent forms will be signed by all parties involved, person&#xD;
           obtaining consent, and the participating parent. One copy will be obtained by the study&#xD;
           personnel and one copy will be given to the participants for their records. The copy&#xD;
           obtained by study personnel will be kept in a locked cabinet. After signing the consent&#xD;
           form, the height and weight of the mother and infant will be measured. She will also be&#xD;
           sent a list of links of questionnaires to be completed at home before the further&#xD;
           screening/pre-intervention assessment. These questionnaires include the Demographic&#xD;
           Questionnaire, Pregnancy History and Infant Feeding Practice Questionnaire, Food&#xD;
           Security Questionnaire, Infant Behavior Questionnaires-Revised (IBQ-R), and Baby Eating&#xD;
           Behavior Questionnaire (BEBQ). Lastly, before dyads leave, the parent will be asked to&#xD;
           list three of their child's favorite foods and rank them on a 7 point Likert type scale&#xD;
           anchored by &quot;Do not Like&quot; to &quot;Like very much&quot;. Mother will then be asked to provide the&#xD;
           child's highest ranked favorite food for the further screening/pre-intervention&#xD;
           assessment visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Further Screening/Pre-Intervention Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
           After orientation, eligible participants will be scheduled for a 45 minute further&#xD;
           screening/pre-intervention assessment session. For this visit, the mother will be&#xD;
           advised to choose a time of the day when the infant is generally alert, active and ready&#xD;
           to play. The infant needs to be fed one hour prior to the lab visit. The mother will be&#xD;
           reminded to bring diapers or change of clothes for the infant. The mother will also be&#xD;
           reminded not to feed her infant the test food (infant's favorite food) 24 hours before&#xD;
           the laboratory visit.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Then, the mother and infant will be escorted to a laboratory room where the food&#xD;
           reinforcement game will take place. Infant will be securely fastened on a high chair.&#xD;
           The mother will be in the room with the infant at all-time during the game. The mother&#xD;
           will be reminded that the entire reinforcement task procedure will be video recorded to&#xD;
           obtain vocalization, body movement and facial expression of the infant. The baseline&#xD;
           state of the infant will be assessed. There are five states: 1 = drowsy, 2 = alert/calm,&#xD;
           3 = alert/active, 4 = fussy, 5 = crying. Before the start of the game, a study staff&#xD;
           member will go through a training session with the infant to familiarize him/her with&#xD;
           the computer based game and button/monitor interface. Mother will be asked to assist&#xD;
           with the training by repeating phrases the researchers use during the game. After the&#xD;
           training, the study staff member will start the actual game followed by infant's&#xD;
           anthropometric measurements.&#xD;
&#xD;
           After completing all measures, families will be further assessed for eligibility&#xD;
           criteria. Eligible participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups; Music&#xD;
           Together program treatment group or the play date control group. Potential participants&#xD;
           who are not eligible for the study will be compensated for their time and effort to&#xD;
           attend the orientation and further screening/pre-intervention assessment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Intervention The 6-week music intervention, the Music Together® program, was designed in&#xD;
           collaboration with a local music studio, Betty's Music Together. This program introduced&#xD;
           infants to the pleasures of music making with their parents rather than passively&#xD;
           receiving it from CDs or TV. This program provided a rich variety of music and playful&#xD;
           activities, which encouraged infants and parents to participate at their own level in&#xD;
           singing, moving, listening, or exploring musical instruments. Participating parents and&#xD;
           infants attended weekly, 45-minute classes as a group on 6 consecutive Saturday&#xD;
           mornings. Besides attending classes, parents were encouraged to listen and sing together&#xD;
           with their infants at home during everyday home activities such as bath time, meal time&#xD;
           and bed time using the CD and instructional song book provided by the program.&#xD;
&#xD;
           The active control group consisted of a weekly, 45-minute play date held on the same 6&#xD;
           consecutive Saturday mornings as the music group. Investigators provided a variety of&#xD;
           age appropriate toys (no musical toys) and books for participating parents and infants&#xD;
           to play with and enjoy. Families in the play date group received a toy, Baby's First&#xD;
           Blocks (Fisher-Price®, East Aurora, NY), to practice and play at home.&#xD;
&#xD;
           Parents in both groups were advised to attend all classes, with an opportunity to attend&#xD;
           one makeup session. To encourage families to listen to the Music Together® songs or to&#xD;
           play with the Baby's First Blocks daily, investigators sent each family a text reminder&#xD;
           every morning Sunday through Friday for the duration of the intervention. Investigators&#xD;
           also sent an email Sunday through Friday evenings to remind them to fill out the daily&#xD;
           home practice survey. Families that filled out at least five of the daily home practice&#xD;
           surveys and attended that week class or play date were entered into a drawing for a $5&#xD;
           gift card to a local grocery or coffee shop.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Post-intervention Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The post-treatment appointment will follow the same structure and timing as the pre-treatment&#xD;
      session with the same measurements. Upon completion of all the measures, families will sign&#xD;
      their payment form and receive a debriefing sheet.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Further Screening/Pre-Intervention Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the orientation, if participant is eligible investigators will schedule a 30 minute&#xD;
      visit of further screening/pre-intervention assessment session with participant where&#xD;
      participant's baby will perform the second part of the reinforcing game.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention:&#xD;
&#xD;
      After this assessment, if infant-mother dyads are eligible infant-mother dyads will be&#xD;
      randomly assigned to Music Together or play date group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Music Together group This program provides CD with a collection of songs, rhythm chants,&#xD;
           &quot;play-alongs&quot;, tonal and rhythm patterns, which will be used in classes. All&#xD;
           infant-mother dyads will attend this 6 weekly, 45-minute classes as a group.&#xD;
           Participants will also receive illustrated songbook with family activities to practice&#xD;
           and enjoy at home along with the CD.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Play date group These play dates will be planned and led by DBM research staff members,&#xD;
           which all infant-mother dyads will attend 6 weekly, 45-minute organized play dates as a&#xD;
           group. Variety of age-appropriate toys (i.e. puzzles, shape sorters, books) will be&#xD;
           provided for the play date. Participants will also receive a toy from us that&#xD;
           participants will take home and use to practice and play with participant's baby.&#xD;
&#xD;
      During the six-week intervention, participants will be asked to fill out a Daily Home&#xD;
      Practice Survey each day for six days of the week (not on the day participant come for the&#xD;
      group meeting).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-Intervention Assessment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      At the end of the 6 week intervention infant-mother dyads will come back into the lab for a&#xD;
      post-test assessment (2 visits). Infant-mother dyads' height and weight will be measured and&#xD;
      payment will be given.&#xD;
