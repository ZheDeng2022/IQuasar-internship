  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this prospective, non-randomized, single-center pilot exploratory study is to&#xD;
      investigate whether established circulating tumor cell (CTC) cultures have a similar response&#xD;
      to targeted therapy treatment as the in vivo (patients') disease.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will isolate circulating tumor cells (CTCs) from blood samples taken from patients&#xD;
      with liver and/or lung metastases who will receive systemic treatments. The CTCs will be&#xD;
      cultured and given the same treatment as the patient received. The main goals of this project&#xD;
      are 1) to assess CTC cultures' treatment response and compare the in vitro response to the&#xD;
      clinical response, and 2) determine the sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value&#xD;
      (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) of CTC cultures' response in predicting clinical&#xD;
      response including complete response (CR), partial response (PR), stable disease (SD) and&#xD;
      progressive disease (PD).&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients with a metastatic solid tumor malignancy with either liver and/or lung&#xD;
             metastasis. Patients with newly diagnosed metastatic disease who have not had systemic&#xD;
             therapy or are progressing on systemic therapy fitting one of the following cohorts:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Patients had a tumor or liquid biopsy with molecular analysis (genomic analysis&#xD;
                  or other type of molecular characterization) resulting in a therapeutic target&#xD;
                  with planned targeted therapy by the patient's treating physician.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Gastric cancer patients who have failed the first and second line chemotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Bladder cancer patients (with liver and/or lung metastasis) who will receive&#xD;
                  systemic treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Scheduled to initiate systemic treatment for management of their disease. The systemic&#xD;
             treatment will be either cytotoxic chemotherapy or targeted therapy but not checkpoint&#xD;
             inhibitor immunotherapy.&#xD;
&#xD;

             including but not limited to: inability to tolerate any study procedures, any physical&#xD;
             limitation that would undermine the safety of the subject in the study, or any&#xD;
             psychiatric or neurological condition that inhibits full comprehension of study&#xD;
