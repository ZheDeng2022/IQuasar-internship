  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      CEST in Stroke is an observational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study in acute ischaemic&#xD;
      stroke patients. Ischaemic stokes are the most common type of stroke and occur when a blood&#xD;
      clot blocks the flow of blood and oxygen your brain needs. This can lead to cellular death&#xD;
      (infarction) so the quicker a stroke is diagnosed and treated, the better a patient's&#xD;
      recovery is likely to be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to determine the technical feasibility of a new MRI technique&#xD;
      known as Chemical Exchange Saturation Transfer (CEST) imaging for assessing the extent of&#xD;
      potentially salvageable brain tissue (penumbra) around an area of infarction. CEST imaging&#xD;
      works by looking at the chemicals in the brain cells. The chemicals may change when cells are&#xD;
      affected by stroke. Stroke patients are not normally treated with with clotbusting drugs or&#xD;
      clot-retrieving devices if they arrive at hospital many hours after the stroke because&#xD;
      treatment may not help and in some cases it may cause more harm than good. However, the new&#xD;
      MRI technique could detect those stroke patients who arrive at hospital many hours after the&#xD;
      stroke but still have salvageable brain - in these cases it would be helpful to treat these&#xD;
      patients and therefore stop those cells from dying.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, there are several technical issues that need to be addressed before CEST can be&#xD;
      adopted as a routine clinical assessment. CEST in Stroke hopes to address these issues by&#xD;
      using an alternate MRI sequence capable of acquiring CEST data over a large portion of the&#xD;
      brain in approximately in 10 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall aim of study is to determine the feasibility of CEST imaging for assessing the&#xD;
      extent of penumbra, in order to determine which patients may benefit from re-perfusion&#xD;
      interventions who would otherwise not be eligible. If the study is successful, further&#xD;
      research will be implemented to help clinical decision making in stroke patients who present&#xD;
      outside of conventional time windows.&#xD;

&#xD;
      Eligible participants (or a consultee) will be approached upon admission in A&amp;E or on the&#xD;
      Hyper Acute Stroke Unit within 24 hours of onset. The study will be described in detail and&#xD;
      an information sheet provided. After being given sufficient time to consider participation,&#xD;
      the participant or their consultee will be asked to complete a consent form. They will be&#xD;
      given a copy of the consent form and information sheet for their records.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one off study visit will then take place. This will entail a 30 minute MRI scan in the&#xD;
      King's College Hospital Clinical Research Facility. In addition, a brief neurological&#xD;
      assessment (routine examination for all stroke patients) will also be performed and the&#xD;
      following information collected: demographics, past medical history and any local laboratory&#xD;
      results. The participant's clinical details will be recorded on a case report form (CRF). Any&#xD;
      clinical information not provided by the participant will be completed using the patient's&#xD;
      medical notes.&#xD;
