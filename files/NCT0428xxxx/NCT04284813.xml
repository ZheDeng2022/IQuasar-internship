  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to develop and evaluate an intervention that adapts Community&#xD;
      Reinforcement and Family Training (CRAFT) for families experiencing first episode psychosis&#xD;
      and substance use delivered via telemedicine (video conferencing). The intervention aims to&#xD;
      improve treatment engagement and reduce distress, and it will be delivered via telemedicine&#xD;
      (CRAFT-FT). To assess feasibility of the intervention, family members will complete the&#xD;
      sessions and provide feedback to refine the treatment manual. Data on client relatives with&#xD;
      psychosis will be collected for preliminary assessment purposes. Client relatives will not&#xD;
      complete the research study intervention.&#xD;
