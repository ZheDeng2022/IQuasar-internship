      SUMMARY&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rationale: For persons with Parkinson's disease (PD), medical decisions are based almost&#xD;
      exclusively on periodic in-clinic evaluations by a neurologist or a nurse. For a variety of&#xD;
      reasons, such &quot;snapshots&quot; are unable to capture the actual impact of PD on the patient's&#xD;
      functioning in their own home environment. Outpatient evaluations cannot detect rare and&#xD;
      typically domestic events, such as falls. In addition, episodic visits are not well suited to&#xD;
      detect changes in important lifestyle issues, such as gradual declines in physical activity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Objective: To objectively, continuously and accurately collect detailed information on&#xD;
      (changes in) physical activity and fall patterns among patients with PD in daily life.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study design: Observational cohort study in 200 patients with PD, with a 12 month follow-up&#xD;
      period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study population: Patients with PD (n=200), with an increased fall risk (i.e. at least one&#xD;
      fall within the last six months).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention (if applicable): This study does not include an intervention. After a baseline&#xD;
      assessment on demographics and PD symptoms, patients will use a remote monitoring system at&#xD;
      home (a pendant falls detector) combined with an smartphone application aimed at falls&#xD;
      self-reporting, and an application to report medication intake for 12 months. A similar set&#xD;
      up (i.e.Vital@Home) has been previously tested on feasibility (Dossiernummer: 2017-3382).&#xD;
      Additionally, patients will report sleep patterns through paper-based diaries.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Main study parameters/endpoints: The main study parameters are physical activity and number&#xD;
      of falls. They are remotely registered by the pendant falls detector.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nature and extent of the burden and risks associated with participation, benefit and group&#xD;
      relatedness: In this study, no invasive measurements will be performed. The participation is&#xD;
      free of risks. Subjects could potentially benefit personally from participating in this&#xD;
      study, as they can use the devices for free during the study and receive periodically&#xD;
      feedback about physical activity and the occurrence of falls.&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients receives advanced therapy for their Parkinson's disease (deep brain&#xD;
             stimulation, duodopa pump, apomorphine pump);&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The patients shows cognitive of psychiatric impairments that may hinder successful&#xD;
