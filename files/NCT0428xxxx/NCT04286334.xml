  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The presence of alveolar ridge deficiencies is considered major limitation to achieve an&#xD;
      implant-prosthetic restoration with high aesthetics and stability over time. Guided Bone&#xD;
      Regeneration (GBR) can be considered an effective solution for bone augmentation. The most&#xD;
      advanced technology of GBR is the customized titanium mesh, which is developed with a fully&#xD;
      digital work flow system. The aim of this study is to evaluate complications and bone&#xD;
      augmentation rates after GBR, based on customized meshes with or without collagen membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After ethical committee approval, 30 patients with horizontal and/or vertical bone defects&#xD;
      were enrolled and treated according to the study protocol. During reconstructive surgery&#xD;
      (T0), patients were randomly divided into two study groups: 15 patients were treated by means&#xD;
      of a custom-made mesh without collagen membrane (Group A - Control Group), while 15 patients&#xD;
      were treated by means of a custom-made titanium mesh with a collagen membrane (Group B - Test&#xD;
      Group). All sites were grafted with a mixture 50:50 of autogenous bone and xenograft and&#xD;
      primary closures of surgical sites were obtained to ensure a submerged healing of the meshes.&#xD;
      After 6 months (T1), re-entry surgery was completed to remove the meshes, evaluate the&#xD;
      augmented volume and to place implants in the augmented sites. After 3 months (T2), soft&#xD;
      tissue management was accomplished with implant exposure and a connective tissue graft,&#xD;
      before prosthetic restoration (T3). Data collection included surgical and healing&#xD;
      complications, planned bone volume (PBV) and reconstructed bone volume (RBV),&#xD;
      pseudo-periosteum type, bone density, implant success, and crestal bone loss. A statistical&#xD;
      analysis of recorded data was performed to investigate any statistically significant&#xD;
      differences between the study group and statistical significance was set at a=0.05.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The rationale of the study is based on the fact that manual and intraoperative modeling of an&#xD;
      osteosynthesis mesh is an employee operator and even in the case of very experienced&#xD;
      operators it is always difficult, inaccurate and slow. The use of this pre-modeled and&#xD;
      pre-fabricated custom-made mesh with bevel margins and three-dimensionally morphology adapted&#xD;
      to the bone defect, would allow for a congruous bone regeneration reducing the operating&#xD;
      times, the risks linked to the mesh trauma, and the discomfort for the patient. The collagen&#xD;
      membrane in association with titanium, based on the principles of guided bone regeneration&#xD;
      (GBR), would make it possible to increase bone gain and reduce the percentage of early and&#xD;
      late exposure of the mesh.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to evaluate, in cases of maxillary and mandibular atrophies characterized by&#xD;
      a vertical and / or horizontal resorption of the alveolar bone, the percentage of&#xD;
      complications (intra- and post-operative) after bone regeneration using custom-made mesh with&#xD;
      or without collagen membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of technique B&#xD;
      (custom-made mesh - without membrane) compared to technique A (custom-made mesh - with&#xD;
      membrane) in the incidence of complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives include evaluation of the missing bone volume (lacking bone volume or&#xD;
      LBV), reconstructed bone volume (reconstructed bone volume or RBV) with respect to planned&#xD;
      bone volume (planned bone volume or PBV), histological and histomorphometric analysis at the&#xD;
      time removal of the mesh and peri-implant bone resorption, due to the functional loading of&#xD;
      the implants, at 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other objectives include the qualitative evaluation of bone regeneration by histological and&#xD;
      histomorphometric analysis upon removal of the mesh; and the evaluation of peri-implant bone&#xD;
      resorption, due to the functional loading of the implants, at 12 months of follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical trial which is promoted by Prof. Claudio Marchetti and the University&#xD;
      Hospital of Bologna - Policlinico Sant'Orsola Malpighi. The study is designed as a pilot,&#xD;
      randomized, monocentric, independent, parallel-group clinical trial, in which the variables&#xD;
      will be analyzed prospectively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have a selection and enrollment period of approximately 12 months; a treatment&#xD;
      period of about 12 months. As a result, the overall duration of the study will be around 24&#xD;
      months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the two-year period 2017/2019 the study will include the treatment of 30 patients, in good&#xD;
      general health, suffering from partial edentulism of the maxilla and / or jaw with vertical&#xD;
      and / or horizontal resorption of the alveolar bone, which require prosthetic rehabilitation&#xD;
      supported by implants to improve function and aesthetics of edentulous areas.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be divided into 2 study groups and assigned to each study group based on the&#xD;
      previously computer-generated randomization sequence: 15 patients (group A, control) will be&#xD;
      treated by bone regeneration with custom-made mesh without a collagen membrane. 15 patients&#xD;
      (group B, test) will be treated by bone regeneration with custom-made mesh with collagen&#xD;
      membrane.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the following table, the 3 treatment phases: The first phase (T0) involved bone&#xD;
      regeneration with a custom-made mesh (group A) and with collagen membrane (group B); the&#xD;
      second one (T1), subsequently, after 6 months: will forsee the removal of the regeneration&#xD;
      device and the insertion of the implants; the thirt (T2), 3 months after the aforementioned,&#xD;
      will forsee the final functional loading of the implants, with a consequent follow-up of the&#xD;
      regenerated bone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All the materials and tools that will be used in the study are CE certified (with the&#xD;
      exception of the custom-made mesh which, as a custom-made device, does not require CE&#xD;
      certification) and have already been used in the normal care path for patients who have&#xD;
      undergone bone regeneration. Moreover, the control visits and the radiological investigations&#xD;
      of the data foreseen by the aforementioned protocol will be collected; They will be&#xD;
      summarized in the case report form (CRF), and are those that characterize the normal care&#xD;
      path of patients undergoing necessary bone regeneration for prosthetic implant rehabilitation&#xD;
      when the bone quantity is insufficient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective of this study is to evaluate the non-inferiority of technique B&#xD;
      (digital technique) compared to technique A (traditional technique) in the incidence of&#xD;
      complications.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Secondary objectives include: assessment of patient and operator benefits, reconstructed&#xD;
      bone volume (RBV) compared to planned bone volume (PBV), histological and histomorphometric&#xD;
      analysis of bone quality obtained and peri-implant bone resorption after 12 months of&#xD;
      follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size necessary to support the null hypothesis is 17 subjects for each group. In&#xD;
      order to compensate for any protocol deviations or possible drop-outs, the number of patients&#xD;
      was increased to 15 per group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results obtained in the two study groups will be subjected to descriptive statistical&#xD;
      analysis and the differences between groups will be tested by means of appropriate&#xD;
      statistical tests for purely exploratory and non-demonstrative purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The patient will be considered as the statistical unit of the analysis, and the statistical&#xD;
      significance will be set at Î± = 0.05.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The collected data will be grouped and summarized with respect to the demographic,&#xD;
      anamnestic, and clinical variables of each patient.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Exploratory analyses will be performed using descriptive statistics. The data will be&#xD;
      presented both for the intent-to-treat population and for the per-protocol population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The sample size necessary to support the null hypothesis is 17 subjects for each group. In&#xD;
      order to compensate for any protocol deviations or possible drop-outs, the number of patients&#xD;
      was increased to 15 per group. The sample size was calculated using dedicated statistical&#xD;
      software (STATA, StataCorp LLC) through Pearson's chi-squared test, guaranteeing a level of&#xD;
      significance of 95% and a power of 80%.&#xD;
