      This study is to evaluate the tolerance of albumin paclitaxel combined with apatinib and&#xD;
      Camrelizumab in the second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerable dose (MTD) of the combination.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This is a Single arm, open, phase I / II clinical trial. The study was divided into tolerance&#xD;
      observation stage (dose exploration stage) and efficacy expansion stage (dose expansion&#xD;
      stage).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is to evaluate the tolerance of albumin-paclitaxel combined with apatinib and&#xD;
      Camrelizumab in the second-line treatment of advanced gastric cancer to determine the maximum&#xD;
      tolerable dose (MTD) of the combination.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The secondary objective was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of albumin- paclitaxel in&#xD;
      combination with apatinib and Camrelizumab in the second-line treatment of advanced gastric&#xD;
      cancer.&#xD;
