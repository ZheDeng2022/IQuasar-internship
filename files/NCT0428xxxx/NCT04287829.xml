  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      There is no standard second line treatment in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab has shown to be active in in small phase II studies in MPM. Its activity&#xD;
      however, is limited, with a response rate up to 20%. So, there is a need for new treatment&#xD;
      combinations with drugs that might exhibit a synergistic interaction with pembrolizumab.&#xD;

      There is no standard second line treatment in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM).&#xD;
      Pembrolizumab has shown to be active in in small phase II studies in MPM. Its activity&#xD;
      however, is limited, with a response rate up to 20%. So, there is a need for new treatment&#xD;
      combinations with drugs that might exhibit a synergistic interaction with pembrolizumab. The&#xD;
      mechanisms of actions of lenvatinib, which has a broad spectrum of activities, predicts many&#xD;
      synergistic interactions with PD-1 blocking. The aim of this study is to characterize the&#xD;
      potential clinical activity, toxicity and biomarkers of outcome of pembrolizumab - lenvatinib&#xD;
      in patients with recurrent MPM.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically diagnosed malignant pleural mesothelioma, age at least&#xD;
             18 years&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Progressive disease after at least 1 and maximal 2 prior systemic treatment lines, in&#xD;
             which one of the lines contains a platinum-based doublet (both cisplatin and&#xD;
             carboplatin are allowed) for unresectable MPM&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Measurable disease. At least one measurable lesion according to Modified (i)RECIST for&#xD;
             pleural mesothelioma. Lesions situated in a previously irradiated area are considered&#xD;
             measurable if progression has been demonstrated in such lesions&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. WHO-ECOG performance status of 0 to 1. Evaluation of ECOG is to be performed within 7&#xD;
             days prior to date of allocation&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Adequate organ function&#xD;
&#xD;

             acceptable representative if applicable) prior to beginning of protocol specific&#xD;
             procedures including the approval of the thoracoscopy or transthoracic pleural biopsy&#xD;
             before the first treatment cycle and an optional biopsy before the third treatment&#xD;
