    <textblock>
      This study is designed to evaluate the initial safety and effectiveness of an investigational&#xD;
      drug, niraparib, given to patients who have recently received platinum-based chemotherapy for&#xD;
      the treatment of prostate cancer. The study enrolls participants with history of advanced&#xD;
      prostate cancer that is growing despite standard hormonal therapies, such as&#xD;
      androgen-deprivation therapy.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Histologically or cytologically confirmed diagnosis of prostate adenocarcinoma (mixed&#xD;
             histology will be acceptable, but pure small cell histology is to be excluded).&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. ≥ 18 years of age.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. No prior therapy with PARP inhibitor therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Patients must have received at least 9 weeks of platinum-based chemotherapy for the&#xD;
             treatment of mCRPC as the proximal treatment regimen prior to study screening.&#xD;
             Patients must not have evidence of clinical or radiographic disease progression (per&#xD;
             Investigator assessment) and should have adequately recovered from&#xD;
             chemotherapy-related toxicities (at least 4 weeks following completion of&#xD;
             chemotherapy, with treatment-related toxicities ≤ grade 1 per CTCAE version 5).&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. ECOG performance status of ≤ 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Documented evidence of a pathogenic or likely pathogenic DNA repair aberration in&#xD;
             BRCA1/2, ATM, FANCA, PALB2, CHEK2, HDAC2, or BRIP1 through either somatic or germline&#xD;
             testing from a CLIA certified laboratory.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Radiographic evidence for metastatic disease. Measureable disease (per RECIST) is not&#xD;
             required for enrollment. (i.e. bone-only metastatic disease is permitted).&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. Patients with history of treated brain metastases are eligible if off systemic&#xD;
             corticosteroids for at least 2 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
          9. Clinical evidence for castration-resistance, with total testosterone &lt; 50 ng/dL.&#xD;
             Patients who have not undergone bilateral orchiectomy must plan to continue ongoing&#xD;
             androgen deprivation therapy for the duration of the trial therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. Patients must have adequate organ function, as confirmed by laboratory values obtained&#xD;
             ≤ 14 calendar days prior to the first day of study therapy:&#xD;
&#xD;
             Hematologic: Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) ≥ 1.5 × 109/L, platelet count ≥ 100 ×&#xD;
             109/L, and hemoglobin ≥ 9 g/dL (may have been transfused)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Hepatic: Total bilirubin level ≤ 1.5 × the upper limit of normal (ULN) range and AST&#xD;
             and ALT levels ≤ 2.5 × ULN or AST and ALT levels ≤ 5 x ULN (for subjects with&#xD;
             documented metastatic disease to the liver). (Note: In subjects with Gilbert's&#xD;
             syndrome, if total bilirubin is &gt;1.5 × ULN, measure direct and indirect bilirubin and&#xD;
             if direct bilirubin is ≤1.5 × ULN, subject may be eligible)&#xD;
&#xD;
             Renal: Estimated creatinine clearance ≥ 45 mL/min using Cockcroft Gault formula.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients must have a projected life expectancy of at least 3 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          1. Prior therapy with a PARP inhibitor.&#xD;
&#xD;
          2. Presence of clinically significant (i.e., active) cardiovascular disease: cerebral&#xD;
             vascular accident/stroke (&lt; 6 months prior to enrollment), myocardial infarction (&lt; 6&#xD;
             months prior to enrollment), unstable angina, congestive heart failure (≥ New York&#xD;
             Heart Association Classification Class II), or serious cardiac arrhythmia requiring&#xD;
             medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
          3. Presence of known significant immunodeficiency, as determined by the treating&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          4. Presence of clinically significant active infections, as determined by the treating&#xD;
             investigator.&#xD;
&#xD;
          5. Known allergy to niraparib or any of its components.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Prostate cancer with histologic evidence for pure small cell histology&#xD;
