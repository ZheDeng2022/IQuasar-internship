  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Early developmentally-based behavioral intervention has well-established positive effects and&#xD;
      is recommended as the standard of care to support early brain maturation, health, and&#xD;
      development. However, few neonatal intensive care units (NICUs) provide this early&#xD;
      intervention. H-HOPE (Hospital to Home: Optimizing the Preterm Infant's Environment) has&#xD;
      established efficacy, and has a standardized protocol, making it ready for widespread&#xD;
      implementation. The infant-directed component of H-HOPE provides Auditory (voice), Tactile&#xD;
      (moderate touch massage), Visual (eye to eye), and Vestibular (rocking) stimulation starting&#xD;
      when infants are ready for social interaction. The parent-directed component of H-HOPE&#xD;
      includes participatory guidance and support to help parents engage with infants in the NICU&#xD;
      and the transition to home. In this NIH-funded research, H-HOPE improved growth,&#xD;
      developmental maturity and mother-infant interaction, and reduced initial hospitalization&#xD;
      costs and acute care visits through 6-weeks corrected age. This research tests whether H-HOPE&#xD;
      can be implemented and sustained in five diverse NICUs, using a Type 3 Hybrid design to&#xD;
      evaluate both implementation processes and effectiveness. The specific aims are to: 1)&#xD;
      Identify the degree of implementation success; 2) Evaluate the effectiveness of H-HOPE for&#xD;
      infants, hospital costs from H-HOPE enrollment until discharge, and parents, compared to a&#xD;
      pre-implementation comparison cohort; and 3) Determine influences (facilitators and barriers)&#xD;
      associated with implementation success and H-HOPE effectiveness, guided by the Consolidated&#xD;
      Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR). An incomplete stepped-wedge design guides&#xD;
      staggered roll-out for five clinical sites. Each NICU completes the CFIR implementation steps&#xD;
      (Planning and Engaging, Executing, and Reflecting and Evaluating), followed by 6 months of&#xD;
      Sustaining. For Aim 1, degree of implementation success is determined every two months as&#xD;
      Sustainability (still offering H-HOPE), Reach (% of eligible parent/infant dyads receiving&#xD;
      H-HOPE) and Degree of Implementation (mean H-HOPE services received per parent-infant unit)&#xD;
      (primary implementation outcomes). For Aim 2, effectiveness is analyzed using generalized&#xD;
      linear mixed models for infant, cost, and parent outcomes (primary outcomes: infant growth at&#xD;
      discharge and acute care visits from discharge to 6-weeks corrected age). Propensity score&#xD;
      analysis is used to make the pre- and post-implementation comparable. For Aim 3, a mixed&#xD;
      methods analyses is used to identify influences from H-HOPE records and interviews that are&#xD;
      associated with implementation success and effectiveness at each site and across sites. This&#xD;
      is the first time implementation in a NICU is guided by the evidence-based CFIR framework,&#xD;
      and results will make a major contribution to implementation science. This study will produce&#xD;
      an evidence-based implementation strategy and Toolkit to disseminate nationwide. Widespread&#xD;
      H-HOPE implementation will make a significant change in clinical practice and improve preterm&#xD;
      infant health and health care costs.&#xD;

  <eligibility>
    <criteria>
      <textblock>
        There are two cohorts of infants and parents: the Pre-H-HOPE Comparison Cohort and H-HOPE&#xD;
        Cohort. H-HOPE is a family intervention, so parent(s) and infants are recruited together&#xD;
        and must meet both parent and infant eligibility criteria. Infant and parent eligibility&#xD;
        criteria are the same for both cohorts (Pre-H-HOPE and H-HOPE). Additionally, there are&#xD;
        criteria for hospital personnel.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for the infant:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  born between 23-35 weeks gestational age (GA)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  have reached 31-32 weeks post menstrual age (PMA)&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  could be receiving oxygen or intravenous therapy&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  could have been previously intubated for mechanical ventilation&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  assessed as ready to begin social interaction Infants of multiple births will be&#xD;
             eligible to participate but data from only one randomly selected infant will be used&#xD;
             in analysis of Aim 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for the parent (up to 2 per infant can be in the study:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  mother, father, other family member, or surrogate parent regardless of age,&#xD;
             race/ethnicity, gender, or sexual orientation, or biological relationship to the&#xD;
             infant&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  intends to act in the role of parent&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  18 years of age or older&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  English or Spanish speaking&#xD;
&#xD;
        Inclusion criteria for hospital personnel:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Hospital Administrator - staff member with an administrative role outside of the NICU&#xD;
        leadership who is knowledgeable about the activities of the NICU NICU Manager - Nurse or&#xD;
        physician with an administrative role in the NICU (e.g. medical director or nurse manager)&#xD;

        Exclusion Criteria We will not be limiting any participants based on sex/gender, or&#xD;
        ethnic/racial identity. Differences due to race and gender will be accounted for during&#xD;
        data analysis. We will be limiting enrollment to English or Spanish speaking parents due to&#xD;
        the limited availability of valid measures for data collection in languages other than&#xD;
        English and Spanish. However, we anticipate that we will still be able to recruit an&#xD;
        ethnically diverse group of parents because of the ethnic composition of the parents at the&#xD;
        sites and our prior experience.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion criteria for the infant:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  major brain injuries (e.g. cystic PVL)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  current sepsis&#xD;
&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  less than 50% effort.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  does not provide direct patient care&#xD;
