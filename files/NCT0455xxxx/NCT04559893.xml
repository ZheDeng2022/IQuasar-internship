  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Collaboration Leading to Addiction Treatment and Recovery from Other Stresses (CLARO) is a&#xD;
      five-year project that tests whether delivering care using a collaborative model helps&#xD;
      patients with both opioid use disorders and mental health disorders.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Untreated mental illness and substance use disorders are prevalent and can have devastating&#xD;
      consequences for the individual, their families and the community. Co-occurring opioid use&#xD;
      disorders (OUD) with either depressive disorders and/or post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)&#xD;
      are of particular concern, because depression and PTSD are prevalent in people with OUD,&#xD;
      co-occurring mental illness is linked to an increased risk for opioid misuse and overdose,&#xD;
      and because of the high prevalence of the chronic use of prescription opioids in individuals&#xD;
      with mental illness, a risk factor for heroin use and the development of an OUD. Primary care&#xD;
      is an important and underutilized setting in which to provide treatment for all three&#xD;
      disorders, because OUD, depression and PTSD are frequently co-morbid with medical conditions.&#xD;
      However, despite the effectiveness of treatments for all three disorders, many individuals&#xD;
      never receive treatment; and, when treatment is provided, quality is low. With the rising&#xD;
      number of opioid-related fatalities, this is a critical treatment and quality gap in a&#xD;
      vulnerable and stigmatized population. Collaborative care (CC) has never been tested with&#xD;
      co-occurring disorders (COD), despite research by our team suggesting it may be effective. CC&#xD;
      consists of a team of providers that includes a care coordinator, a primary care provider&#xD;
      (PCP) and a behavioral health consultant (BHC), who provide evidence- and measurement-based&#xD;
      care to a panel of patients using a clinical registry. In our CC model for COD (CC-COD), the&#xD;
      CC team also includes a behavioral health psychotherapist (BHP); the evidence-based&#xD;
      treatments supported include medications for OUD (MOUD), pharmacotherapy for depression and&#xD;
      PTSD, motivational interviewing (MI), problem solving therapy (PST) and Written Exposure&#xD;
      Therapy (WET).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study consists of a multi-site, randomized pragmatic trial in 14 rural and urban&#xD;
      primary care clinics located in Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSA) of New Mexico to&#xD;
      adapt, harmonize and then test whether CCCOD improves access, quality and outcomes for&#xD;
      primary care patients with co-morbid OUD and depression and/or PTSD. The study will randomize&#xD;
      900 patients with co-occurring OUD and depression disorder and/or PTSD to receive either&#xD;
      CC-COD or enhanced usual care (EUC).&#xD;
