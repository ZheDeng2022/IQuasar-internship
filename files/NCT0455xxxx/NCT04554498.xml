      The primary goal of the study is to evaluate in patients on three times a week on-line HDF&#xD;
      the efficacy, in terms of toxin removal and modulation of the inflammatory state, of two&#xD;
      different dialyzers: Helixone versus Asimmetric cellulose triacetate (ATA).&#xD;

      Patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have a significantly increased cardiovascular&#xD;
      mortality rate compared to the general population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the USRDS (United States Renal Data System), in 2017 the prevalence of&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease in the United States was 65.8% in patients with chronic kidney disease&#xD;
      (CKD), compared to 31.9% of the subjects with stable renal function&#xD;
      (https://www.usrds.org/2017/view/v1_04.aspx).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the natural history of nephropathy, besides the traditional cardiovascular risk factors,&#xD;
      an increasingly important role is played by the nontraditional factors related to uremia and&#xD;
      dialysis treatment, namely anemia, hyperhomocysteinemia, malnutrition, hyperparathyroidism,&#xD;
      electrolyte imbalance, and above all chronic inflammatory state and oxidative stress. The&#xD;
      main components of dialysis-related inflammatory response include neutrophil and monocyte&#xD;
      activation, cytokine release, oxidative stress with production of free radicals, lipid and&#xD;
      protein oxidation, and alterations in blood redox state.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is much evidence to indicate that ESRD patients, especially those on dialysis, are&#xD;
      exposed to increased oxidative and carbonyl stress, that cause chemical modifications of&#xD;
      proteins and accumulation of AGEs (advanced glycation end products).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The formation of AGEs occurs through Maillard reaction, a non-enzymatic glycation of peptide&#xD;
      amino groups, resulting in protein structural and functional alteration and production of&#xD;
      reactive carbonyl species .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Several studies have demonstrated a correlation between the levels of tissue AGEs and the&#xD;
      development of various complications, since the accumulation of AGEs constitutes an index of&#xD;
      hyperglycemia, oxidative stress and inflammation. The activation and up-regulation of the AGE&#xD;
      receptors, including the main one RAGE (AGE Receptor), leads to the initiation of&#xD;
      inflammatory cascades involved in the formation of atherosclerotic plaques and endothelial&#xD;
      dysfunction, and lastly in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease. AGEs are also related&#xD;
      to the thickening of the intima-media tunica of the carotid arteries, considered a marker of&#xD;
      arteriosclerosis, as clinically confirmed by the close relationship between coronary artery&#xD;
      disease and atherosclerotic complications in diabetes and renal failure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Besides AGEs, a huge pattern of protein-bound toxins and of middle molecular weight uremic&#xD;
      toxins are known to contribute to the uremic syndrome in terms of cardiovascular&#xD;
      complications, inflammation and fibrosis . Concerning protein-bound uremic toxins, p-cresyl&#xD;
      sulfate and indoxyl sulfate have received considerable attention recently. Among middle&#xD;
      molecules, B2M, free light chains and FGF23 have been identified as markers of disease&#xD;
      progression and mortality in CKD and hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Furthermore, the activation of leukocytes, both in response to the exposure to dialysis&#xD;
      membranes and as a consequence of the retrotransportation of substances that promote the&#xD;
      expression of cytokines from the dialysate, increases the release of proinflammatory&#xD;
      cytokines, such as IL-1β, TNF-α and IL-6.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The biocompatibility and flow properties of the different filters can influence the&#xD;
      inflammatory and oxidative response to dialysis and the levels of oxidized molecules. In&#xD;
      general, short-term dialysis with high-flow membranes has been shown to decrease plasma&#xD;
      levels of oxidized low-density lipoproteins, regardless of the filter material.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Nonetheless, the introduction of high-flux membranes, which increased clearance of middle&#xD;
      molecules, appears to be inadequate to improve patient survival, as reported by two major&#xD;
      randomized trials, the HEMO study [24] and the MPO study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The use of on-line HDF, that combines convective and diffusive solute removal, can&#xD;
      counterbalance the rapid decrease of middle molecule diffusion obtained with high flux&#xD;
      hemodialysis. The integration of diffusion with convection allows a more modest sieving&#xD;
      coefficient decrease for middle molecular weight solutes. To date, evidence from four&#xD;
      randomized controlled trials on HDF suggests, although not definitely, that HDF with&#xD;
      convection volumes &gt;20 L results in better patient outcomes .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, a correlation of the membrane typology with inflammation and oxidative stress in&#xD;
      the medium-long term was found in patients undergoing chronic dialysis treatment. A&#xD;
      prospective study in a cohort of 50 patients who started hemodialysis with a high-flux&#xD;
      polysulfone membrane (HF80 series, Fresenius Medical Care, St. Wendel, Germany) evaluated the&#xD;
      variation of the inflammation and oxidative stress biomarkers. The results showed&#xD;
      significantly increased circulating levels of IL-6, C-reactive protein (CRP) and higher&#xD;
      carbonylation rate in dialysis patients compared to healthy controls in the first year of&#xD;
      observation, and this trend was maintained in the following 12 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Successive studies investigated the long-term effects on inflammation and oxidative stress of&#xD;
      dialysis with Helixone (Fresenius Medical Care), another type of high-flux polysulfone&#xD;
      membrane designed to maximize the clearance of uremic toxins of average molecular weight (&gt;&#xD;
      500 Daltons, Da) compared to conventional high-flux membranes. The introduction of changes as&#xD;
      reduced hollow fiber wall thickness (≈35 μm), smaller inner diameter (≈185 μm) and higher&#xD;
      average pore size (≈3.3 nm) has improved the clearance of medium molecular weight molecules,&#xD;
      including β2-microglobulin (B2M), limiting the passage of larger molecules like albumin,&#xD;
      without significant effects on inflammatory parameters .&#xD;
&#xD;
      The features of synthetic membranes related their chemical composition and the asymmetric&#xD;
      structure of the fibers make them preferable for new highly-convective therapies, such as&#xD;
      high-volume hemodiafiltration (HDF), only partially allowed with cellulose.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, cellulose triacetate (CTA) and modified cellulose membranes remain the best option&#xD;
      for the patients with hypersensitivity reactions to synthetic fibers. Although synthetic&#xD;
      membranes, including those based on polysulfone, have a lower risk of hypersensitization than&#xD;
      non-biocompatible ones (such as Cuprophane), in some cases adverse reactions have been&#xD;
      reported, plausibly due to the contact between the dialyzer itself with plasma proteins and&#xD;
      platelets.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Moreover, the choice of polysulfone membranes has been proven to affect the intracellular and&#xD;
      serum levels of bisphenol A (BPA, molecular weight 228.3 kDa), a ubiquitous environmental&#xD;
      toxicant found in plastic food and beverage containers, as well as in some dialyzers, with&#xD;
      several detrimental effects. BPA is considered an endocrine-disrupting chemical that acts&#xD;
      mainly as a female hormone: it is associated with reproductive dysfunction, immune&#xD;
      abnormality and increased incidence of cancer. Patients on hemodialysis are a high-risk&#xD;
      population for BPA overload, because the normal urinary elimination of the conjugated&#xD;
      molecule decreases with low renal function. For these reasons, BPA can be thought as a uremic&#xD;
      toxin, similarly to p-cresol, and a particular attention should be given to BPA-containing&#xD;
      medical devices, including dialysis membranes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Mas et al. compared BPA-free and BPA-containing dialyzers in 72 patients under on-line HDF,&#xD;
      using a prospective 9-month, crossover study design. BPA-free dialyzers determined a greater&#xD;
      long-term decrease in BPA levels compared to BPA-containing dialyzers, although at three&#xD;
      months the difference was not significant. This may be due to the use of the on-line HDF&#xD;
      technique that has been related to lower BPA levels than conventional hemodialysis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, a new generation filter in asymmetric triacetate (ATA) has been introduced, born&#xD;
      from a technology that combines the requirements of synthetic membranes for the possibility&#xD;
      of being used with high-volume HDF and the advantages of natural fibers (cellulose) in terms&#xD;
      of reduced allergic reactions.&#xD;
&#xD;
      These novel ATA membranes have been demonstrated to achieve satisfactory Kt and convection&#xD;
      volume, with good biocompatibility and inflammatory profiles, indicating them as a valuable&#xD;
      option for patients allergic to synthetic membranes under HDF treatment.&#xD;
