  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study was to show the value of pharmacists in providing transitions of care to and&#xD;
      improving health outcomes of uninsured populations. It also aimed to demonstrate the&#xD;
      feasibility of implementing a transitions of care program in an indigent care clinic with&#xD;
      limited resources. We hypothesized that a pharmacist-led transitions of care program will&#xD;
      reduce 30-day hospital readmission rates among the uninsured discharged from a community&#xD;
      hospital.&#xD;
