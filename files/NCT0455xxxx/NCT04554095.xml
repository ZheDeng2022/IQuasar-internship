  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Weaning from mechanical ventilation (MV) is a complex process in which patients are liberated&#xD;
      from the ventilator. Prolongued weaning and weaning failure, defined as the need for&#xD;
      reintubation, have different adverse effects, including prolongation of MV, intensive care&#xD;
      unit (ICU) and hospital stay, and are also associated with increased incidence of&#xD;
      ventilator-associated pneumonia and high mortality. The rate of weaning failure is high, even&#xD;
      when the classic extubation criteria are met, so it is necessary to improve scores that allow&#xD;
      predicting and determining the ideal time for MV withdrawal.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim of this study is to design a new multimodal index to predict and optimize weaning&#xD;
      results in a personalized way, based on the use and interpretation of data derived from&#xD;
      continuous monitoring of critically ill patients. The new multimodal index, in addition to&#xD;
      classical respiratory parameters, will include parameters related to patient-ventilator&#xD;
      interaction (asynchronies), diaphragmatic function, cardiovascular status and autonomic&#xD;
      nervous system function (ANS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have designed a prospective observational study that will include 126&#xD;
      critical patients from a medical-surgical ICU that meet the classical criteria for weaning.&#xD;
      The management of the patients, as well as the weaning process, will be carried out following&#xD;
      the usual protocol. In addition to the classical weaning predictor data, data on the&#xD;
      patient-ventilator interaction and the function of the autonomic nervous system will be&#xD;
      collected by means of specific software (BetterCare). Cardiovascular and diaphragmatic&#xD;
      function will be evaluated using ultrasound. Based on the advanced analysis of data from&#xD;
      different devices collected throughout the mechanical ventilation period, it will be designed&#xD;
      a &quot;personalized&quot; weaning score that should improve the accuracy of the decision-making&#xD;
      process and therefore reduce morbidity and mortality. Additional benefits would include&#xD;
      lowering health care costs without increasing adverse events.&#xD;
