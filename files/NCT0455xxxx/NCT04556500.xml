  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study aimed to translate the Affordance in the Home Environment for Motor Development&#xD;
      -Toddler (AHEMD-T) into Turkish and examine its psychometric properties.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Child motor development is a complex process which results from the interaction between&#xD;
      genetics and the environment. The role of the home as the first environment for child&#xD;
      experiences is very important for motor development, especially during infancy. Thus, a more&#xD;
      supportive and stimulating environment is associated with more affordances and challenges for&#xD;
      infant motor development that may lead to improvement in social and cognitive development.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There is no Turkish questionnaire to evaluate home environment so we aimed to translate the&#xD;
      AHEMD-T for using with Turkish children and to investigate psychometric properties.&#xD;

    <measure>Affordance in the Home Environment for Motor Development-Toddler (AHMED-T)</measure>
    <time_frame>6 months</time_frame>
    <description>AHEMD-T consists 67 items with 5 section as outdoor environment, indoor environment, variety of stimulation, gross motor toys and fine motor toys. In addition to simple questions with yes-no responses or a Likert scale, this tool uses descriptive questions and visual examples to guide the respondent in the category of the toys provided. The total score of less than 10 was considered low and a poor assessment of affordance in the home environment. This meant that a few poor-quality opportunities were afforded in the home environment for child motor development. A score of 10-15 was a medium and sufficient assessment with adequate and suitable affordances in the home environment for child motor development. A score of 17-21 was considered high and reflected excellent opportunities in the home environment for child motor development.</description>
