      This study aim to assess lower limb kinematics and muscle EMG reliability during gait in&#xD;
      typically developing toddlers and in toddlers with unilateral cerebral palsy with less than 6&#xD;
      months of independent walking experience and secondary to determine three sources of&#xD;
      variability (between subjects, between sessions and between trials) using an optoelectronic&#xD;
      system and a surface EMG system. The third aim was to identify the most reliable gait&#xD;
      parameters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This was a cross-sectional study conducted between January 2016 and May 2018 in the Motion&#xD;
      Analysis Laboratory of the National Rehabilitation Center for Children (NRCC) &quot;Dr. N.&#xD;
      Robanescu&quot;, Bucharest (Romania). The toddlers with UCP were recruited among the inpatients&#xD;
      and outpatients of the Pediatric Rehabilitation department. TD toddlers were recruited among&#xD;
      the siblings of the toddlers with UCP and the children of people known to the investigators.&#xD;
      Given the exploratory nature of this study, the target size of each group was set to a&#xD;
      minimum of 10 participants per group.Toddlers from both groups were younger than 3 years old&#xD;
      and independent walking experience of maximum 6 months. Every child was proposed to be&#xD;
      evaluated in two gait analysis sessions within a period of 30 days. The second gait analysis&#xD;
      session was planned approximately at 14 days from the first one. The two sessions were&#xD;
      performed by the same experienced assessor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The toddlers walked barefoot at self-selected pace. Each toddler was equipped with 19&#xD;
      reflective markers and 8 surface EMG electrodes. Data was collected with a BTS motion capture&#xD;
      system equipped with 8 infrared cameras and 8 channels EMG system. The biomechanical model&#xD;
      used was &quot;Helen Hayes with medial markers&quot;.The EMG electrodes were positioned according to&#xD;
      the SENIAM recommendations over the rectus femoris, the medial hamstrings, the tibialis&#xD;
      anterior and the triceps surae.Visual 3D software (C-motion, Rockville, MD, USA) was used to&#xD;
      build the kinematic model and identify gait cycles. A qualitative analysis was conducted for&#xD;
      each gait cycle and each child in order to exclude the cycles during running or non-straight&#xD;
      walking. Data was filtered and normalized. Three sources of variability (between subjects,&#xD;
      between sessions and between trials) for kinematics and EMG data were quantified by&#xD;
      calculating the standard deviations for each source.Standard Error of Measurement (SEM) for&#xD;
      intertrials and intersessions were also calculated. For TD toddlers, a single value was&#xD;
      reported as the quadratic mean for the right and left sides.&#xD;

For UCP toddlers, the SEM was calculated separately for the affected and the non-affected sides.
