  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      EndoVigilant software device augments existing colonoscopy procedure video in real-time by&#xD;
      highlighting colon polyps and mucosal abnormalities. It is intended to assist&#xD;
      gastroenterologists in detection of adenomas and serrated polyps. The device is an adjunctive&#xD;
      tool and is not intended to replace physicians' decision making related to detection,&#xD;
      diagnosis or treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study with an adaptive design measures the clinical benefit (increase in detection of&#xD;
      adenomatous and serrated polyps) and increased risk (increased extraction of non-adenomas)&#xD;
      during standard colonoscopy procedures when EndoVigilant software device is used.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study will analyze the clinical benefit and risk of using the EndoVigilant polyp&#xD;
      detection assistance software based device during screening and surveillance colonoscopy&#xD;
      procedures. The study subjects will be randomized to a procedure with or without the use of&#xD;
      EndoVigilant software. While using this device, colonoscopy will continue to be performed in&#xD;
      the standard manner as is done without the use of this device. The video signal from the&#xD;
      colonoscope will be fed into a computer running the EndoVigilant software in addition to the&#xD;
      standard video output to the procedure monitor. The gastroenterologist performing the&#xD;
      procedure will therefore be able to observe a standard colonoscopy video on the primary&#xD;
      monitor and the augmented video on the second monitor. The gastroenterologist may rely on the&#xD;
      second monitor (with augmented video generated from EndoVigilant software) for polyp&#xD;
      detection, but the standard procedure monitor with the original feed will always be&#xD;
      operational and available for maneuvers such as fast insertion, polypectomy etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will have an adaptive design with an interim analysis after 700 subjects to&#xD;
      re-estimate the final sample size of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will include a diverse set of endoscopists across age, sex, years of experience and&#xD;
      practice settings. In order to comply with FDA guidance this pivotal study will only include&#xD;
      endoscopists with ADR of 25-40% in their routine clinical practice. At the discretion of&#xD;
      Endovigilant, endoscopists with an ADR of &lt;25% or &gt;40% may be included for a separate&#xD;
      exploratory analysis to examine the impact of the system on endoscopists with ADR outside of&#xD;
      the FDA-mandated range. But in accordance with FDA guidance, the procedures done by these&#xD;
      endoscopists will not be included in the primary endpoint analysis.&#xD;
