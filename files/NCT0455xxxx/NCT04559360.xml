  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The prevalence of mental health disorders in Primary Care (PC) largely exceeds the limited&#xD;
      resources available. The main aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive machine&#xD;
      learning (ML) digital support platform (PRESTO) to approach people with mental health&#xD;
      symptoms in PC. PRESTO will offer a transdiagnostic triage of those cases needing specialized&#xD;
      care while most of the mild and moderate cases with anxiety and depressive symptoms will be&#xD;
      allocated through ML models to either: 1.a periodic follow-up, 2.symptoms monitoring and&#xD;
      brief psychological intervention with a smartphone app, or 3.a specific psychopharmacological&#xD;
      treatment. To reach this objective, first, a ML predictive severity model will be build based&#xD;
      on all the cases referred to the PC mental health support programme during the last 5 years&#xD;
      retrieved from electronic health records from 5 PC centres(PCC) in Barcelona. Simultaneously,&#xD;
      a smartphone app (PRESTOapp) monitoring symptoms and delivering a psychological intervention&#xD;
      for non-severe anxious and depressive symptomatology will be developed and tested in a&#xD;
      feasibility study and in a randomized clinical trial. Finally, the ML models obtained from&#xD;
      the first phase of the project and the data from the PRESTOapp study will be integrated in a&#xD;
      comprehensive self-learning web platform which will triage and assign to each case a specific&#xD;
      intervention based on the predicted outcome. The effectiveness of PRESTO to reduce waiting&#xD;
      times in receiving appropriate and specific care of mental health problems will be tested by&#xD;
      means of a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial in 5 PCCs in Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we register a Randomized controlled clinical trial with PRESTOapp 2.0 detailed&#xD;

      times in receiving appropriate and specific care of mental health problems will be tested by&#xD;
      means of a stepped-wedge randomized controlled trial in 5 PCCs in Barcelona.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Here we register a Randomized controlled clinical trial with PRESTOapp 2.0.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Design: Single-blind randomized controlled clinical trial.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample: Referrals to mental health support programme (PCMHSP) by GPs from the 5 primary&#xD;
           care centres included in the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Sample size calculation: Considering the priority (primary outcome) the reduction of&#xD;
           depressive symptoms assessed by PHQ-9 and taking into account two groups (PRESTOapp 2.0&#xD;
           vs. treatment as usual) in addition to previous results of effect sizes between 0.30 -&#xD;
           0.35 from similar studies (similar intervention, same scale), we have established a&#xD;
           power of 0.80 and a α of 0.05. Considering the current numbers of visits by all members&#xD;
           of the PCMHSP who can potentially be offered inclusion in the study in 6 months (1000&#xD;
           individuals), the total sample should have at least 122 participants. However,&#xD;
           experience in similar studies indicates an expected 25-30% drop-out. Therefore, it was&#xD;
           decided to add 15 more subjects per branch for preventive purposes and to ensure that at&#xD;
           the end of the study there would be a sufficient sample to guarantee the strength of the&#xD;
           data.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Intervention Group (PRESTOapp 2.0): 76 participants&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Control Group (Treatment as usual): 76 participants TOTAL: 152 participants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Considering the number of PCMHSP members involved in the project as well as the high number&#xD;
      of referrals (which is the main problem this project is trying to solve), reaching these&#xD;
      numbers is fully feasible within the stipulated time.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Inclusion criteria: Individuals 18-65 years of age who are referred to or are being&#xD;
           followed up by members of the PCMHSP in the 5 PCCs corresponding to the 5 Barcelona&#xD;
           catchment areas (ABS), scoring between 4 and 14 points on the PHQ-9 scale, or 6 to 15 on&#xD;
           the GAD-7 scale. They must also accept and sign the informed consent for study&#xD;
           participation and must have a compatible smartphone (Android or iPhone).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exclusion criteria: Individuals who do not know and/or do not wish to learn the skills&#xD;
           required to operate a smartphone. Estimated IQ less than 70 with functional impairment&#xD;
           Patients with a severe mental disorder (Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenic Disorder,&#xD;
           Schizoaffective, Obsessive-Compulsive) or substance use disorder, PHQ-9 &gt;= 15, GAD-7 &gt;=&#xD;
           16. People with moderate to severe suicidal ideation (PHQ-9 Question 9 with a score of 2&#xD;
           or 3)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Recruitment procedure: All users referred to PCMHSPs by GPs from the PCC included in the&#xD;
           study will be offered participation in the study. Once the information on the study has&#xD;
           been provided, which will also be available in printed form in the waiting room for&#xD;
           consultations, any doubts presented by the user will be cleared up and the signature of&#xD;
           the informed consent will be requested.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Randomization: Once users are recruited, an independent researcher will randomize the&#xD;
           participants using a 1:1 sequential method in two groups of 76 individuals and will&#xD;
           assign a 6-digit identification code (IC) to each participant. The IC will be given to&#xD;
           the participant on a reminder card and will be used to access the app to guaranteeing&#xD;
           its confidentiality. The name of the subjects and their respective code will be stored&#xD;
           in independent servers for methodological, security, and legal reasons. The intervention&#xD;
           group will be asked to use the app for a period of 2 months. The control group will&#xD;
           receive the usual follow-up and treatment during the same time by the PCMHSP team.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Data collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
           * Initial evaluation: The estimated time used for the initial evaluation including an&#xD;
           explanation of the study, signing of the informed consent, and data collection is of&#xD;
           about 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
           ■ Intervention Group: In this first visit, a brief explanation of how the app works and&#xD;
           a brochure explaining PRESTOapp 2.0 will be given. Users will be asked to use the app on&#xD;
           their smartphone for the next 2 months. During this first visit, we will help the&#xD;
           participant to install the app. Subsequently, the following data will be collected:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Demographic variables: gender, age, marital status, housing condition, number of&#xD;
           children, years of education, educational level, employment status.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Clinical variables: medical comorbidities, hospitalizations, number of depressive&#xD;
           episodes and previous hospitalizations, history of psychotic symptoms, seasonal pattern,&#xD;
           history of melancholy, atypical, psychotic or catatonic symptoms in depressive episodes,&#xD;
           comorbidity (axes I, II and III), family history (first degree) of psychiatric disorders&#xD;
           and suicide, number of self-initiated attempts and method.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Care variables: Number of visits in MAP in the last 5 years, number of visits in PSP,&#xD;
           number of consultations in the emergency department. The 9-items Patient Health&#xD;
           Questionnaire (PHQ-9)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The 7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-7)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  World Health Organization 5-item General Welfare Index (WHO-5)&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Holmes and Rahe Stress Scale&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be informed that the next follow-up visit (and clinical assessment) by the&#xD;
      PCMHSP will be in 2 months at the end of the study unless the app indicates or symptoms that&#xD;
      require urgent care arise.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ■ Control Group: The same information and scales as for the intervention group will be&#xD;
      collected.&#xD;
&#xD;
      * Follow-up evaluation: A follow-up appointment will be carried out in both groups after 2&#xD;
      months, lasting approximately 30 minutes, during which the same data collected in the&#xD;
      baseline interview will be collected, in addition to the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM),&#xD;
      usability with the System usability scale (SUS), and satisfaction with the Health App&#xD;
      Usability Questionnaire (MAUQ).&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Statistical analysis: All the data will be collected by the project researchers and the&#xD;
           PCMHSP team, and stored in encrypted and secure servers. The data from the app will be&#xD;
           managed by the researchers only. Statistical analyses will be conducted using specific R&#xD;
           packages. The analyses of all the subjects included will be considered until the&#xD;
           abandonment or end of the study. The main variable is the change in symptoms measured by&#xD;
           PHQ-9, GAD-7, secondarily it will be considered WHO-5, during the 2 months, controlled&#xD;
           by life stressors as assessed by the Holmes y Rahe scale. We will use a mixed effects&#xD;
           linear model with random interception for each participant. The differences in the&#xD;
           primary measures will be analyzed first in an unadjusted manner and then adjusted for&#xD;
           sociodemographic and clinical factors collected, if you present a p≤0.1 in univariate&#xD;
           analysis. An analysis by intention to treat (ITT) with last observation carried&#xD;
           performed (LOCF) will also be employed. A threshold of statistical significance p≤0.05&#xD;
           (two-tailed) will be set.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Study limitations: There is no investigator blinded for logistical and ethical reasons,&#xD;
           nor is there a placebo in the case of controls. The main reason for this design is that&#xD;
           the methodological effects of providing a placebo app to the control group are unclear.&#xD;
           Assumable risks are the placebo effect in the intervention group, natural progression,&#xD;
           and regression to the mean.&#xD;
