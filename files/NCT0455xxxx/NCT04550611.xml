      1. study the pharmacokinetics of mini-pooled intravenous immunoglobulin( MP-IVIG)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. to determine the efﬁcacy of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIg) in hastening recovery and&#xD;
           reducing the complications of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS).&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  The MP-IVIG was tolerated and presented no safety issues in a previous study and we&#xD;
                will be confirmed by monitoring any adverse events (anaphylaxis and haemolysis) (&#xD;
                no or mild or moderate) and reporting them to ethical committee safety monitoring&#xD;
                group.&#xD;
&#xD;
             -  Efficacy will be confirmed by:&#xD;
&#xD;
                  1. Patient able to walk&#xD;
&#xD;
                  2. Improvement of general health.&#xD;
&#xD;
                  3. Integration in to social live&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. to compare the efﬁcacy of IVIg to plasma exchange (PE) in hastening recovery and&#xD;
           improving the condition of GBS&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) is a frequent cause of neuromuscular paralysis occurring at all&#xD;
      ages. The incidence of GBS is reported to be 1.2-2.3 per 100,000 per year .&#xD;
&#xD;
      GBS is a post infectious disorder. The most frequently identified preceding infection is&#xD;
      Campylobacter jejuni. Others are cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae,&#xD;
      and Haemophilus influenzae . Many reports have documented the occurrence of GBS shortly after&#xD;
      vaccinations, operations, or stressful events, but the causality and pathophysiology are&#xD;
      still debated .&#xD;
&#xD;
      Rapidly progressive weakness is the core clinical feature of GBS. By definition, maximal&#xD;
      weakness is reached within 4 weeks, but most patients reach it within 2 to 3 weeks.&#xD;
      Thereafter, patients enter a plateau phase that ranges from days to several weeks or months .&#xD;
      This phase is followed by a usually much slower and variable recovery phase. In Europe, about&#xD;
      one-third of GBS patients remain able to walk (&quot;mild patients&quot;) .about 25% of the GBS&#xD;
      patients who are unable to walk (&quot;severe patients&quot;) need artificial ventilation. This is&#xD;
      predominantly due to weakness of the respiratory muscles. GBS has a great impact on social&#xD;
      life and the ability to perform activities of daily life. therefore, GBS remains a severe&#xD;
      disease for which better treatments are required .&#xD;
&#xD;
      . Magdy EL-Ekiaby, et al 2010 introduce the concept of small-scale (&quot;minipool&quot;) plasma&#xD;
      processing methods. The preparation of the Immunoglobulin G (IgG) plasma fractionation from&#xD;
      20 blood donations which are tested for anti-A and anti-B titre &lt; 32. Implementable with&#xD;
      minimum infrastructural requirements. They developed viral inactivation and protein&#xD;
      purification technologies in single-use equipment to prepare virally safe&#xD;
      solvent/detergent-filtered (S/D-F) plasma Producing a 90%pure immunoglobulin fraction in&#xD;
      disposable single-use devices for transfusion .&#xD;
&#xD;
      IVIG adverse events (AEs) are not frequent; hemolysis after IVIG is a known, rare&#xD;
      complication. Higher doses and non-O blood group are key risk factors. The incidence of&#xD;
      post-IVIG hemolysis is estimated at 1 per 1000 IVIG treatment episodes, most of which occur&#xD;
      within 2 days of exposure. Although the preparation of blood group specific IVIGs in industry&#xD;
      is a complex issue because of the pooling of thousands of plasma donations per batch, the&#xD;
      preparation of blood group-specific mini-pool IVIG (MP-IVIG) is possible because each pool&#xD;
      consists of only 20 plasma donations. Blood group-matched MP-IVIG is assumed to reduce the&#xD;
      incidence of IVIG-associated hemolysis, which is largely caused by the presence of anti-A and&#xD;
      anti-B agglutinins reacting with non-O blood group recipients.&#xD;
