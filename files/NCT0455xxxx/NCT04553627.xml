  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to evaluate the safety and efficacy of cryolipolysis of the&#xD;
      medial infragluteal fold to create the appearance of a gluteal lift.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this study, the safety and the efficacy of ZELTIQ's technology will be evaluated for the&#xD;
      non-invasive fat reduction of the medial infragluteal folds on a small group of subjects.&#xD;
      This is a feasibility study to determine if cryolipolysis in this area produces a desirable&#xD;
      lifted appearance to the buttocks. Typically, a lifted more youthful appearance is obtained&#xD;
      through surgical means. Study participants will be recruited from the population of patients&#xD;
      who have suitable, treatable subcutaneous fat on the medial infragluteal folds and desire a&#xD;
      lifted appearance. Subjects will receive treatments with a cooled cup cryolipolysis&#xD;
      applicator from the CoolAdvantage family of applicators (cooled cup vacuum applicator).&#xD;
      Treatments will be performed with a treatment temperature of - 11°C for up to 35 minutes.&#xD;
      Subjects will complete all study-required follow-up visits, including an 8-week follow-up&#xD;
      which may include a second treatment session, as well as a 12-week post final treatment&#xD;
      follow-up visit.&#xD;

    <description>The primary endpoint of the study is to evaluate the efficacy of subcutaneous fat reduction in the medial intragluteal folds using the ZELTIQ System as a non-invasive clinical treatment. Quantitative measurements of efficacy will be determined by review of 3-D images from a Vectra H2 software by Canfield Scientific, Inc. measuring buttock volume difference in cc, angle formed at the inner gluteal vertex in degrees, and Height difference from the top to the bottom of the buttock in mm and surface area reduction calculations in cm2</description>
