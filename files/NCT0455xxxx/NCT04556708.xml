  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The use of chlorhexidine or ozonized water in periodontal pockets accompanying NPT can&#xD;
      provide a significant improvement in probing pocket depths compared to conventional&#xD;
      treatment. However, the effect of subgingival ozonized water applications on VEGF and IGF&#xD;
      levels, which are thought to play a role in the pathogenesis of periodontal disease and&#xD;
      periodontal regeneration, should be examined.&#xD;

      Background: This study aims to evaluate the effects of subgingival ozonated water irrigation&#xD;
      as an adjunct to non-surgical periodontal treatment on clinical and biochemical parameters of&#xD;
      patients with moderate and severe periodontitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Methods: A total of 72 stage II and Stage III periodontitis patients were included in the&#xD;
      study. The systemically healthy patients which were between the ages of 19 and 58 were&#xD;
      treated non-surgically. At the end of each visit concerning periodontal treatment, the pocket&#xD;
      of each tooth was irrigated with a sterile plastic syringe (10 mL per quadrant) with a blunt&#xD;
      tip containing ozonated water (OW; ozone groups), 0.12% chlorhexidine digluconate (CHX&#xD;
      groups) or saline (C; control groups) for 30-60 s. Periodontal clinical parameters, gingival&#xD;
      crevicular fluid (GCF) vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and insulin-like growth&#xD;
      factor-1 (IGF-1) levels were evaluated at baseline and 8 weeks after periodontal treatment.&#xD;
      All statistical data were analyzed using SPSS software.&#xD;
