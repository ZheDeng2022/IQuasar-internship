      The investigator is testing the ability of a biologically active therapy in blinatumomab, an&#xD;
      anti-CD19/CD3 bispecific T-cell engager, to further reduce residual leukemia immediately&#xD;
      prior to HCT to improve post-HCT outcomes. This Phase 2 study will determine the&#xD;
      effectiveness of delivering 1 to 2 cycles of blinatumomab (Days 1-28) as bridging therapy in&#xD;
      children, adolescent and young adults with relapse or persistent MRD B-ALL. Eligible subjects&#xD;
      will receive 1 or 2, 28-day cycles of blinatumomab prior to proceeding to HCT. Centralized&#xD;
      MRD assessment will be performed after completion of the 28-days of blinatumomab using both&#xD;
      flow cytometry (University of Washington, Brent Wood, MD) and High-Throughput Deep Sequencing&#xD;
      (HTS) MRD technologies (Adaptive Technologies, Seattle, WA). Subjects who achieve flow&#xD;
      cytometry negative MRD (&lt;0.01%) after a single cycle of blinatumomab can proceed directly to&#xD;
      HCT whereas subjects who remain MRD positive by flow cytometry may receive a 2nd cycle of&#xD;
      blinatumomab. Subjects who remain MRD positive by flow cytometry after a 2nd cycle of&#xD;
      blinatumomab will come off study.&#xD;

             blasts) with MRD in the bone marrow (≥ 0.01%) by multi-parameter flow cytometry and&#xD;
             that meets one of the following:&#xD;
