      The purpose of the study is to to obtain preliminary data on the effects of twelve weeks oral&#xD;

    <description>Recruitment feasibility will be measured by the rates of recruitment at the baseline time-point.</description>

  <primary_outcome>
    <measure>To determine adherence of a two arm randomized clinical trial of EGCG supplementation in older survivors of colon cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>12 week</time_frame>
    <description>The proportion of subjects that adhered to study procedures and the EGCG intervention at the 12 week time-point.</description>

    <measure>To obtain preliminary data on the effects of EGCG supplementation vs Usual Care on Fried's Frailty in older survivors of colon cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty will be measured by the Fried's Frailty Score (weight loss, weakness measured by hand-grip dynamometry, slowness measured by 4 meter walk test, physical activity measure by the specific activities scale, and exhaustion measured by the symptom inventory). Fried's Frailty Score ranges from zero to five with a score of zero being the least frail and signifying that the participant have no frailty characteristics and a score of five being the highest and signifying that the participant has all five frailty characteristics.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>To obtain preliminary data on the effects of EGCG supplementation vs Usual Care on the Deficit Accumulation Frailty Index (DAFI) in older survivors of colon cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline, 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Frailty will be measured by the Deficit Accumulation Frailty Index (DAFI) based on the geriatric assessment. DAFI score will range from zero to one with a score of zero signifying the least frail and a score of one signifying the most frail.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with a change TNF-α immune responses in older survivors of colon cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in TNF-α will be defined as an increase of serum levels of TNF-α, TNFR I, TNFRII, IL-6, IL-1β, or CRP (all measured in ug/mL) from baseline to 12 weeks from baseline</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with a change in circulating immune cells in older survivors of colon cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
    <description>Change in circulating immune cells will be defined as the increase in the numbers of lymphocytes, monocytes, neutrophils, or total White Blood Cells (WBC) from baseline to 12 weeks from baseline</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Number of participants with a change in circulating immune cell ratios in older survivors of colon cancer</measure>
    <time_frame>Baseline to 12 weeks</time_frame>
