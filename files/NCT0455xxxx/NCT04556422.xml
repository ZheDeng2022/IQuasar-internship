  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Sauna bathing has been associated with a lower risk for cardiovascular disease (CVD)&#xD;
      outcomes, improved vascular endothelial and cardiac function, reduced oxidative stress and&#xD;
      lower blood pressure. Earlier studies conducted by the investigators have showed positive&#xD;
      alterations of arterial stiffness and hemodynamics through sauna bathing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Some studies have sought to utilize sauna bathing as an intervention after exercise with&#xD;
      promising and synergistic results, although the effects on populations with cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk factors are less clear. Furthermore, studies investigating the use of both exercise and&#xD;
      sauna bathing in combination has been somewhat limited. However, results from some studies&#xD;
      speculate that adjunctive exercise and sauna interventions may be useful for aging and&#xD;
      clinical patient population groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given that heat therapy and sauna use is gaining more worldwide popularity, the investigators&#xD;
      sought to compare the acute hemodynamic effects between sauna use alone and a short bout of&#xD;
      exercise followed by sauna exposure. It was hypothesize that the combination of exercise and&#xD;
      sauna will elicit greater changes than sauna alone. To achieve this, we standardized the&#xD;
      protocol duration (30 minutes).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      In this crossover trial, all study participants underwent two interventions, each on a&#xD;
      separate occasion (&gt;72 hours apart). A standalone 30-minute sauna at 75°C (S), and 15-minutes&#xD;
      of cycling on the stationary bike at 75% maximum heart rate, followed by 15-minutes of sauna&#xD;
      exposure (ES). A cycling exercise test was conducted on a separate day prior to the&#xD;
      experiment to ascertain individual maximal exercise heart rates, which was then used to&#xD;
      calculate individual 75% maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the ﬁrst 15-minute period of S, the participants left the sauna room to have a quick&#xD;
      shower (&lt;30 seconds) before going back for the second 15-minute period. The same sauna&#xD;
      bathing room (75°C) was used for all participants and the cycling exercise was conducted&#xD;
      within 10 meters of the sauna room to minimize transit time during ES. Participants were&#xD;
      instructed to abstain from eating 2h, caffeine 12h and alcohol 24h prior to the measurements.&#xD;
      Food intake was not standardized. Fluid was consumed ad libitum. A medical physician was in&#xD;
      attendance at all times and participants were allowed to leave the sauna or stop the&#xD;
      experiment at any time if they felt uncomfortable.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Brachial blood pressures and pulse wave velocity (PWV) as a measure of arterial stiffness,&#xD;
      were taken in their respective order at three different time points; before (PRE),&#xD;
      immediately after (POST), and after a 30-minute recovery (POST30). Transit time from the&#xD;
      cessation of the intervention to POST measurements were kept under 60 seconds. All&#xD;
      measurements were performed by the same assessor to minimize ascertainment biases.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants were permitted to take a quick shower (&lt;30 seconds) before POST measurements&#xD;
      were taken. Water temperature or the shower was not controlled and participants could freely&#xD;
      select their desired temperature. Thereafter, they were instructed to rest in a designated&#xD;
      waiting lounge (mean temperature 21°C) in a seated position for a duration of 30-minutes&#xD;
      before the last measurement (POST30) was taken.&#xD;
