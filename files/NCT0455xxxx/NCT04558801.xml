  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of the trial is to study the effect of a mobile application-based lifestyle change&#xD;
      program on body weight loss in adult subjects with obesity. The main focus is to motivate and&#xD;
      support beneficial lifestyle changes targeting long-term weight management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study comprises two randomly assigned study arms: mobile application-based lifestyle&#xD;
      change program and &quot;waiting-list&quot; control. The mobile application-based lifestyle change&#xD;
      program consists of twice a week content for the first 6 months, continuing with less&#xD;
      frequent contents for the following 6 months (the length of intervention 12 months). The&#xD;
      &quot;waiting-list&quot; control group will receive mobile application-based lifestyle change program&#xD;
      after 6 months followed by intervention for 12 months. The main aim is to demonstrate that&#xD;
      the users of mobile application-based lifestyle change program lose more weight than controls&#xD;
      at 6 month timepoint and weight loss is maintained for 18 months (6 months after the end of&#xD;
      mobile application-based lifestyle change program use). Weight is measured and blood samples&#xD;
      (lipids, glucose and metabolic syndrome measures) are collected at 0, 6, 12, and 18 months.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The mobile application-based counselling contains aspects of cognitive behavior therapy and&#xD;
      persuasive system design and consists of twice a week reminders, tasks, self-monitoring, and&#xD;
      reflection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main outcome is the decrease in body weight. Secondary outcomes are changes in eating&#xD;
      behavior, psychological factors, components of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference,&#xD;
      plasma lipid and glucose values, blood pressure), and calculated scores of metabolic&#xD;
      condition and adiposity.&#xD;

    <description>This arm receives the mobile application-based lifestyle change program at baseline. The mobile application-based lifestyle change program consists of twice a week content for the first 6 months, continuing with less frequent content for the following 6 months. The follow-up period is 6 months. Weight is measured and blood samples (lipids, glucose and metabolic syndrome measures) are collected at 0, 6, 12, and 18 months.&#xD;
The mobile application-based counselling contains aspects of cognitive behavior therapy and persuasive system design and consists of twice a week reminders, tasks, self-monitoring, and reflection.</description>
