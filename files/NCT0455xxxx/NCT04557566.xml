      The purpose of this study is to examine whether the Eat Breathe Thrive (EBT) Yoga for Eating&#xD;
      Disorder Recovery online course is effective in supporting eating disorder recovery.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      We will conduct a block randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing an intervention group and&#xD;
      a waitlist control group. Participants in the intervention group will complete the Eat&#xD;
      Breathe Thrive (EBT) Yoga for Eating Disorder Recovery online course. This course will be led&#xD;
      by certified facilitators via Zoom and offered over the course of four weeks, comprising one&#xD;
      two-hour session per week. The course will continue to recruit and enroll participants until&#xD;
      sufficient power is reached for the study. At Pretest, Posttest 1, Posttest 2, and&#xD;
      three-months Follow-Up, participants will complete a series of self-report measures (see&#xD;
      point 12.3). Participants in the waitlist control group will only be engaged in the study&#xD;
      assessment procedures. However, they will be given the opportunity to take part in the Yoga&#xD;
      for Eating Disorder Recovery online course that was delivered to the intervention group, once&#xD;
      Posttest 1 has been completed by both groups.&#xD;
