  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Exercise is one of the most vital components of health maintenance. Exercising regularly&#xD;
      maintains the cardiovascular system health, promotes the health of liver, and declines the&#xD;
      risks of complications induced by CHCV. Since overweight is the main risk factor for IR and&#xD;
      type 2 DM which may speed the liver disease progression among HCV patients, exercise is very&#xD;
      important for maintenance and loss of weight. Further, exercise can relieve the side effects&#xD;
      of medications of HCV, improve immunity, promote a sense of well-being, reduce levels of&#xD;
      chronic fatigue, improve blood oxygen levels and increase the endorphins excretion which&#xD;
      makes the patients fully energized (Elgendi, Shebl A, Sliem M, and Gary FA, 2018).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Studies on exercise effect in patients with CHCV are quite scarce (de Sousa Fernandes et al.,&#xD;
      2019). Decreased leptin levels by exercise positively modulate insulin signaling and inhibit&#xD;
      pathology progression (Anaruma et al., 2019). Since studies investigated physical activity&#xD;
      effect on regulating HCV related leptin levels are very little, the present study aimed to&#xD;
      explore the response of serum leptin and liver enzymes to aerobic exercise in nondiabetic&#xD;
      overweight men with CHCV.&#xD;

      The study group (n=20) received three sessions of aerobic walking exercise per week for 3&#xD;
      months. Every session was done on an electronic treadmill with no inclination started with 5&#xD;
      minutes warm-up then 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic training with 60-75% of target&#xD;
      heart rate then followed or ended by 5 minutes cool down. The control group (n=20) will&#xD;
      receive no training.&#xD;
