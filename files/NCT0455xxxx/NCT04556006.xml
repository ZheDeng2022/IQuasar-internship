    <textblock>
      This randomized controlled trial was conducted with 58 patients hospitalized in the&#xD;
      cardiology clinic of a state hospital. Personal Information Form, Anthropometric&#xD;
      measurements, Framingham risk score, and compliance questionnaire (CQ) were used to collect&#xD;
      the data.&#xD;

    <description>Compliance Questionnaire (CQ) is a form allowing to investigate 11 different areas such as the use of medication causing maladaptation in disease management in individuals with chronic illnesses, diet, weight loss, limiting physical activity, exercise, coping with stress, alcohol use, smoking, sexual activity problems, caffeine intake and working/job life.&#xD;
In the form allowing Likert-type evaluation, the participant is expected to select one of the options 0 (never), 1 (very rarely), 2 (sometimes), 3 (most of the time) or 4 (always) while expressing his/her compliance level for each adaptation area. The scores corresponding to the given expression are summed and CQ score for each participant is determined. The maximum score is 44. High score signifies an increase in the compliance level to the disease.</description>

    <description>The patients in the control group received only the standard care provided by the clinicians. After the collection of post-test data, the content of the training was also explained to these patients and the study was completed by giving them the training guide.</description>

    <description>The training program was applied by the researcher who also work as an academic nurse. The contact information of the patients was obtained and the contact information of the researcher was also given to the patients. In order to consolidate the information given, the training guide was given to the patients in the intervention group. After the training, the patients in the intervention group were contacted again in the 2nd week by using face-to-face interview and in the 4th-8th and 12th weeks by phone calls. During these interviews, the questions of the patients, if any, were answered and the problems they faced regarding the disease management were tried to be solved. In the last interview, an appointment day was determined to meet face-to-face at home, workplaces or hospital according to the preferences of the patients.</description>

    <description>The data collection process of the study was carried out in two stages using data collection tools.&#xD;
First stage: Personal Information Form and Compliance Questionnaire were applied to all patients in both groups. After anthropometric measurements, FR score was determined. The data collection forms were filled with the patients using face-to-face interview technique. The data collection process lasted for approximately 10-15 minutes. After the data collection, the patients in the intervention group were trained. No training was given to the patients in the control group but they received a &quot;Coronary Artery Disease Management Guide&quot;.&#xD;
Second stage: 12 weeks after the first interview, the patients were interviewed again face-to-face interview technique and the forms and measurements applied initially were repeated.</description>
