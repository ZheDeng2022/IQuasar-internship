  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a Phase 1, open label, multicenter, nonrandomized, multiple dose, safety,&#xD;
      tolerability, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic study of PF-07220060 administered as a&#xD;
      single agent and then in combination with endocrine therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1A, single escalating doses of PF-07220060 alone will be administered to determine&#xD;
      the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) and select the recommended phase 2 dose (RP2D).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1B and Part 1C, PF-07220060 will be administered in combination with 1 of 2 endocrine&#xD;
      therapies (letrozole and fulvestrant, respectively).&#xD;
&#xD;
      In Part 1D, food effect assessment of PF-07220060 at the RP2D dose level from the Part 1A&#xD;
      will be conducted.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 1B and Part 1C may commence at MTD or before reaching the MTD at a dose level in Part&#xD;
      1A.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Part 2B and Part 2C are expansion for combination therapy of PF-07220060 with letrozole and&#xD;
      fulvestrant, respectively.&#xD;
