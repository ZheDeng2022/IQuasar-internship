  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is a first-line treatment for kidney stones &gt;2cm.&#xD;
      Frequently, patients require multiple procedures to address their stone burden. The decision&#xD;
      to proceed with a second-look procedure is based on follow-up CT imaging, which is obtained&#xD;
      postoperatively. In this study, we propose the use of a portable CT scan technology to obtain&#xD;
      follow-up imaging while the patient is still under anesthesia for the initial procedure. The&#xD;
      goal of this study is to determine whether this allows the surgeon to identify residual&#xD;
      fragments and render the patient stone-free within a single anesthetic event.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Percutaneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) is considered a first-line management option for kidney&#xD;
      stones larger than two centimeters. Unfortunately, because of the large stone burden, up to&#xD;
      70% of these patients are left with residual stone fragments after their initial PCNL.&#xD;
      Additionally, an estimated 20% to 60% of such patients ultimately require further&#xD;
      interventions due to residual stone fragments. The need for a subsequent procedure is&#xD;
      determined by postoperative abdominal computed tomography (CT) imaging, which is routinely&#xD;
      performed on the first postoperative day at this institution. The decision to proceed with a&#xD;
      second procedure is based on findings from this postoperative CT scan.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cone-beam CT (CBCT) is a novel portable imaging technique that can allow cross-sectional&#xD;
      imaging to be obtained intraoperatively, rather than post-operatively. Incorporating this&#xD;
      modality would allow the surgeon to determine whether the procedure should be continued, in&#xD;
      the event of residual fragments, or if it can be safely concluded. This would obviate the&#xD;
      need for dedicated postoperative CT scans and, more importantly, reduce the need for&#xD;
      subsequent procedures and consequently decrease the patient's length of stay.&#xD;
