  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The transversus abdominis plane (TAP) block is an already established technique and is&#xD;
      considered now as an efficient part of the multimodal pain management approach for abdominal&#xD;
      surgical procedures. The quadratus lumborum block (QLB) is a recently described regional&#xD;
      block that was first described by Blanco et al , which has been reported to provide an&#xD;
      effective analgesia for upper and lower abdominal surgeries. The aim of this study is to&#xD;
      compare the analgesic efficacy of TAP block and QLB 1 after laparoscopic abdominal surgery&#xD;
      regarding opioid consumption, duration of analgesia and visual analog score.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This prospective randomized controlled observer-blinded study compared between the analgesic&#xD;
      efficacy between TAP block (n=25) versus QL block (n=25) in patients aged (18-60) years of&#xD;
      American society of anesthesiologists physical status class I &amp; II scheduled for elective&#xD;
      laparoscopic abdominal surgical procedures. The primary outcome was the cumulative morphine&#xD;
      consumption at first 24 hours postoperatively. Secondary outcomes included VAS scores, first&#xD;
      analgesic requirements and any postoperative complications&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This prospective randomized, observer-blinded paralleled groups study was conducted following&#xD;
      the tents of the Declaration of Helsinki. This study was approved by the local institutional&#xD;
      ethics committee and local institutional review board of Fayoum university hospital and&#xD;
      written informed consent was obtained from 50 adult patients scheduled for elective&#xD;
      laparoscopic abdominal surgical procedures (inguinal hernia repair-missed IUCD&#xD;
      extraction-appendectomy-ovarian vein ligation) between July 2019 and February 2020.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients were randomly allocated into two groups (QLB group n=25 and TAPB group n=25) using&#xD;
      computer generated random numbers kept in separate opaque envelopes that were opened by the&#xD;
      study investigator just before the block. The patient and the data collector were unaware of&#xD;
      the group allocation till the end of the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-operative assessment (History, examination and investigations) was done (according to the&#xD;
      local protocol designed to evaluate the patients). Demographic characteristics: age, weight,&#xD;
      height and BMI were recorded in preoperative assessment of patients. All patients received&#xD;
      150 mg Ranitidine oral tablet at night and on the morning just before the operation as a&#xD;
      premedication. Before surgery, the participants received education about the VAS pain score&#xD;
      (0-10) (where 0 = no pain and 10 = worst comprehensible pain) and the details of the nerve&#xD;
      block procedures. After a 6 hrs fasting, the patients were taken to the operation theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Upon arrival to the operating room standard monitors (Pulse oximeter, noninvasive blood&#xD;
      pressure monitoring, capnography and electrocardiogram) were applied and continued all over&#xD;
      the operation, an 18 gauge peripheral intravenous (IV) cannula was inserted, IV midazolam&#xD;
      0.03 mgkg-1, metoclopramide 10 mg, and ceftriaxone 1 gm were administered to all patients as&#xD;
      premedication then pre-oxygenation with O2 100% for at least 3 min then induction of&#xD;
      anesthesia was done with fentanyl 1μgkg-1, propofol 1.5-2 mgkg-1 and atracurium 0.5 mgkg-1.&#xD;
      Anesthesia was maintained by volume controlled ventilation (VCV) tidal volume 6-8 mlkg-1 with&#xD;
      oxygen and air (50:50) with target of EtCO2≈ 35-40 mmHg, isoflurane 1:1.5 % volume&#xD;
      concentration and atracurium 0.1 mgkg-1 every 20-30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study solution was prepared in two syringes each contained 20 ml of bupivacaine 0.25%. By&#xD;
      the end of surgery and before recovery from general anesthesia, either blocks were done using&#xD;
      a high-frequency ultrasound probe Active Array L12-4 (8-13MHz) of an ultrasound machine&#xD;
      (Philips clear vue350, Philips healthcare, Andover MA01810, USA) and a 22-gauge, 50 mm&#xD;
      echogenic needle (Stimuplex D; B Braun, Germany).&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the ultrasound-guided quadratus lumborum block group, the patient was placed in lateral&#xD;
      position and skin sterilization was done with povidone iodine. Then a high frequency linear&#xD;
      probe was placed above the iliac crest to recognize the three layers of the abdominal wall&#xD;
      muscles. Transversus abdominis was traced posteriorly until the transversus aponeurosis&#xD;
      appeared, then the probe tilted slightly caudal to enhance the appearance of transversus&#xD;
      aponeurosis. QL was identified medial to the aponeurosis of transversus abdominis muscle.&#xD;
      Then the needle was inserted from supero-anterior to postero-inferior and advanced using in&#xD;
      plane technique till the needle tip reached the anterolateral border of the QL at its&#xD;
      junction with transversalis fascia. After negative aspiration (to exclude intravascular&#xD;
      injection), the correct needle position was confirmed by hydrodissection using 1mL of normal&#xD;
      saline. Then 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine was applied. The same technique was performed on the&#xD;
      other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the ultrasound-guided TAP block, skin sterilization was done with povidone iodine. The&#xD;
      probe was placed in the mid-axillary line above the level of the anterior superior iliac&#xD;
      spine, then slided cranially till the three abdominal wall muscles identified (External&#xD;
      oblique muscle (EAO), internal oblique muscle (IOM) and transverse abdominis muscle (TAM)).&#xD;
      The needle was advanced using in-plane technique till it reached the transvers abdominis&#xD;
      plane between the IOM and TAM, the correct needle position was proved by hydrodissection&#xD;
      using 1 mL of normal saline. An injection of 20 mL of 0.25% bupivacaine was applied. The same&#xD;
      technique was performed on the other side.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After performing the block anesthesia was discontinued and tracheal extubation was done once&#xD;
      the patient fulfilled the extubation criteria. Patients were transferred to post-anesthetic&#xD;
      care unit (PACU), where they were discharged from the PACU after a modified Aldrete score≥9.&#xD;
      Visual analogue scale (VAS) was used to assess postoperative pain. All patients received&#xD;
      analgesics according to the local institutional protocol as following (paracetamol 1gm IV&#xD;
      infusion/8 hrs and ketorolac 30 mg IM/12 hrs.). A postoperative rescue analgesia with&#xD;
      morphine sulfate IV was given to patients with VAS &gt;4 at a bolus dose of 3 mg increments with&#xD;
      a maximum dose of 15mg per 4 hours or 45mg per 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Sample size was estimated using G*Power© software version 3.1.9.2 (Institute of experimental&#xD;
      psychology, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany)149 with total opioid consumption&#xD;
      among the two groups as the main primary outcome. Previous similar researches150 demonstrated&#xD;
      that the effect size between the two groups was expected to be large of 1.12 and it&#xD;
      calculated that 42 patients (21 patients per group) would provide to achieve a power of 95%&#xD;
      with type I error rate of 0.05. However, we assigned 50 patients (25 patients per group) to&#xD;
      compensate for data loss. The collected data were organized, tabulated and statistically&#xD;
      analyzed using SPSS software statistical computer package version 22 (SPSS Inc, USA). Data&#xD;
      were tested for normality using shapiro-wilks test. Numerical variables such as age, body&#xD;
      weight, height and BMI were normally distributed and were described as mean ± standard&#xD;
      deviation (SD). An independent t-test was used to compare the mean values of the two groups.&#xD;
      Other variables were not normally distributed and were presented as median and interquartile&#xD;
      range (IQR); Mann-Whitney U test was used as a test of significance. The time-to-event&#xD;
      variable (time to analgesic request) was evaluated using the Kaplan-Meier method, and the&#xD;
      logrank test was used to compare the groups. Qualitative data were presented as numbers and&#xD;
      percentages, and the chi-squared test was used to determine significance. A two-sided P-value&#xD;
      of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant.&#xD;
