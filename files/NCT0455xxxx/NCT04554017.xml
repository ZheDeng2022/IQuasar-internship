  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension among children and adolescents is on the rise in both developed and developing&#xD;
      countries. Childhood and adolescent obesity, a key factor for hypertension in this population&#xD;
      results largely from unhealthy dietary and physical inactivity behaviours. Adequate&#xD;
      knowledge, a component for behavior change, has been found to be crucial to improving one's&#xD;
      confidence to tackle these improper behaviours. Despite this, there are gaps in knowledge on&#xD;
      hypertension and its risks factors in Ghanaian adolescents. Using an educational intervention&#xD;
      (health talk), the study therefore sought to improve knowledge on preventive measures of&#xD;
      hypertension among senior high school students in Ghana.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      A pre-post interventional study using health talks was carried out among 345 adolescents aged&#xD;
      13 to 20 years. Participants included both male and female students aged 13 to 20 years.&#xD;
      Owing to the large number, the students were divided into two groups. The Pre-test was then&#xD;
      administered. Following this, two health education sessions were delivered by two registered&#xD;
      nurses for each session. A week after these health talks, the research team went back to the&#xD;
      school to collect data for the post-intervention. Questionnaires used for both pre and post&#xD;
      assessment collected data on demographic factors and knowledge on dietary and physical&#xD;
      activity behaviours linked to hypertension.&#xD;
