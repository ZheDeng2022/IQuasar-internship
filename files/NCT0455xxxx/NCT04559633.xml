  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Anxious school refusal (ASR) is a common disorder which concerns more and more adolescents&#xD;
      who are at worse completely absent from school. A specific ambulatory cognitive and&#xD;
      behavioral therapy (CBT) program has been established to gradually reintegrate the child back&#xD;
      into the school environment with a multidisciplinary team. Alongside school reintegration&#xD;
      assessment, the child's overall ability to function and anxiety levels will be measured&#xD;
      before and after the program with additional assessments made after a further 6 and 12 months&#xD;
      have elapsed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      ASR concerns children and adolescents who feel anxiety about going to school. Some are&#xD;
      totally absent, some just have difficulty remaining in school for the entire day, or go to&#xD;
      school following behavioral problems such as morning tantrums or psychosomatic complaints.&#xD;
      Anxiety disorders are the main diagnostic underlying this behavioral problem, with one or&#xD;
      many anxiety disorders associated (i.e. separation anxiety disorder, panic disorder, social&#xD;
      anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder or specific phobia). ASR causes much distress&#xD;
      to the child, the parents, and the school personnel and interferes with social and&#xD;
      educational development. Children with severe or chronic school refusal appear to have a&#xD;
      long-term risk of adult mental health issues (e.g. anxiety, depression). Studies about ASR&#xD;
      are few, and nonexistent in France. ASR occurs in approximately 1% of all school-aged&#xD;
      children, and 5% of all clinic-referred children, is equally common in both boys and girls&#xD;
      but more frequent in adolescents. Recommendations for anxiety disorder treatment in youth is&#xD;
      psychotherapy. CBT, especially exposure-based, is the intervention that is supported by&#xD;
      numerous, randomized, controlled trials in this area. But concerning ASR, there are few&#xD;
      studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A specific ambulatory therapeutic CBT program for totally absent from school adolescents is&#xD;
      established within the children and adolescent psychiatric unit in the University Hospital of&#xD;
      Montpellier, France. The unit has implemented CBT techniques to gradually reintegrate the&#xD;
      child back into the school environment. This program will be implemented in 4 other child and&#xD;
      adolescent psychiatry centers (Perpignan, Marseille, Béziers and Nîmes).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main objective of this study is to evaluate the efficiency of a CBT program on the return&#xD;
      back to school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. To evaluate the feasibility in implantation of this program&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. To describe the characteristics of adolescents&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. To assess the initial severity of mental disorders and the evolution of these disorders&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. To describe the evolution of patient anxiety&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. To describe the evolution of the overall functioning&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. To evaluate the efficiency on the return back to school at 6 and 12 month after&#xD;
           intervention.&#xD;
