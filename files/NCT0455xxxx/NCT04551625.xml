      Background:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are overrepresented in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM)&#xD;
      and often have a major impact on quality of life. Typical symptoms of diabetic enteropathy&#xD;
      include abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, constipation, faecal incontinence, and&#xD;
      bloating. Bowel symptoms in DM are usually caused by widespread dysfunction of the GI tract,&#xD;
      but the exact pathophysiology remains incompletely understood. Within recent years, new&#xD;
      methods for detailed assessment of GI motility have been developed. Hence, the&#xD;
      electromagnetic 3D-Transit system is a safe, non-invasive method for detailed description of&#xD;
      GI motility. The system tracks the exact position of an ingested electromagnetic capsule&#xD;
      through the entire GI tract and provides detailed information on both regional transit- and&#xD;
      contraction patterns. High Resolution Colonic Manometry (HRCM) allows extremely detailed&#xD;
      description of contraction patterns in the colon. The HRCM is however an invasive method, as&#xD;
      the catheter is placed during colonoscopy. HRCM has not previously been performed on diabetic&#xD;
      patients and 3D-Transit has only been used sparingly.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Study Objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The purpose of this study is to obtain detailed description of colonic contractions in&#xD;
      patients with DM and gastrointestinal symptoms, especially during fast and after meals.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hypothesis:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Patients with DM and GI symptoms have reduced high-amplitude, antegrade contractions in&#xD;
           the colon when compared to healthy controls (HRCM).&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Patients with DM and GI symptoms have reduced long, fast mass-movements when compared to&#xD;
           healthy controls (3D-Transit).&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. The contractile response to a meal is reduced in patients with symptoms of diabetic&#xD;
           enteropathy when compared to healthy controls.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Materials and methods:&#xD;
&#xD;
      20 patients with DM type 1 or 2 and GI symptoms will be investigated simultaneously HCRM and&#xD;
      the 3D-Transit capsule. Data will be compared to the healthy from another study&#xD;
      (CIV-19-05-028726). A colonoscopy is performed to install the HRCM catheter and place two&#xD;
      3D-Transit capsules within the colon. For 24 hours, the participants lie in a bed in the&#xD;
      research lab while pressure changes from the HRCM catheter are recorded and the 3D-Transit&#xD;
      capsules are followed through the gastrointestinal system.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Perspectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study will add to the very limited data available on colonic dysfunction in DM.&#xD;
