  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      For an analytical validation of the method for the determination of blood&#xD;
      hosphatidylethathanol, it is necessary to:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  to compare the results of chronic and excessive ethanol patients with the cut-off&#xD;
           proposed in the literature.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Also assess the stability of phosphatidylethanol in total blood collected, and in&#xD;
           blotted dried blood stains (DBS), depending on temperature (ambient temperature and&#xD;
           +4°C)&#xD;
