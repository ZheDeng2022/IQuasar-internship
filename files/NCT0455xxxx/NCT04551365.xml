  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to compare the effects of chitosan diet supplementation to a&#xD;
      placebo supplement on changes in gut microbiota, body weight and different health parameters&#xD;
      among different population groups, being either obese (BMI 30-50) and undertaking major&#xD;
      changes in lifestyle (patients) or being those not undergoing any major lifestyle changes&#xD;
      (volunteers, BMI 18.5-35).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be conducted as a double-blind, block randomized, placebo-controlled&#xD;
      intervention trial to study the effects of chitosan supplementation among two women&#xD;
      population groups (Block 1- patients with obesity undergoing lifestyle changes; Block 2-women&#xD;
      not undergoing major lifestyle changes) on their gut microbiota composition, body weight and&#xD;
      composition among several other health parameters (blood pressure, blood lipids, blood sugar,&#xD;
      insulin, hs-CRP, leptin). Furthermore, additional information will be collected: Health&#xD;
      status, mental health, physical activity level, evaluation of stool appearance and defecation&#xD;
      frequency by means of questionnaires; physical activity tracking, changes in body composition&#xD;
      (muscle mass, body and visceral fat); evaluation of physical performance as well as adverse&#xD;
      effects and remarks (diary book). The overall trial time for each subject will be 15 weeks: 1&#xD;
      week for baseline evaluation, 12 weeks intervention period and 2 weeks follow up.Collection&#xD;
      of data will be done at 4 timepoints: at baseline, after 2 weeks of treatment, after 12 weeks&#xD;
      of treatment and 2 weeks after the treatment ends (follow up).&#xD;
