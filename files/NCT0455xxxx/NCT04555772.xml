  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Traumatic brain injury is combination damage that occurs as a result of a chain reaction of&#xD;
      various metabolic events that develop after primary damage caused by trauma. Pathological&#xD;
      events such as lactic acidosis, electrolyte imbalance, increased inflammation that occur&#xD;
      during traumatic brain injury leads to poor prognosis in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The retrospective study was conducted to investigate the effect of factors that may cause&#xD;
      secondary damage, especially electrolyte imbalance and blood glucose levels, on mortality and&#xD;
      morbidity in patients undergoing emergency surgery due to head trauma.&#xD;

    <description>It seems that secondary damage caused by metabolic events like eletrolyte imbalance in patients with head trauma should always keep in mind. If they encounter these situations, they should treat the patient and do replacements immediately.</description>
