  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      As a third-generation dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB), Amlodipine is mainly&#xD;
      used in a single therapy or combined therapy for hypertension or angina.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Edema, one of the most common side effects of dihydropyridine CCB formulations, may lead to&#xD;
      drug control or discontinuation of drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This clinical study intends to assess the safety and efficacy of S-amlodipine, which is&#xD;
      assessed to be superior to Amlodipine in the aspects of antihypertensive effect and side&#xD;
      effects, in edema of patients with essential hypertension.&#xD;

      1. Clinical Study Design&#xD;
&#xD;
           - In this clinical study, Part 1 is conducted as a preliminary study on 10 subjects at a&#xD;
           single center, and based on the results of Part 1, the sponsor and the principal&#xD;
           investigator determine whether to proceed with Part 2. With Part 2 as the multicenter&#xD;
           main study conducted on the remaining 70 subjects, 80 subjects in total have been&#xD;
           planned for Part 1 and Part 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Interim analysis&#xD;
&#xD;
           - The interim analysis is conducted when the study on 10 subjects at a Part 1 single&#xD;
           center has been completed; the analysis is made on all endpoints planned for this&#xD;
           clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Clinical study methods - During screening, subjects who have voluntarily signed the&#xD;
           Informed Consent Form are tested for eligibility to this clinical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a wash-out period of at least two weeks, subjects who satisfy the inclusion/exclusion&#xD;
      criteria are randomly assigned to two groups (S-amlodipine group, Amlodipine group).&#xD;
      Thereafter, the subjects are enrolled and orally administered with the investigational&#xD;
      product once a day for 12 weeks, during which they receive a total of five visits for tests&#xD;
      conducted for assessment of efficacy and safety.&#xD;
&#xD;
      (In case of confirmed eligibility without administration of contraindications, the wash-out&#xD;
      period may be omitted and Visits 1 and 2 may be paid on the same day)&#xD;
