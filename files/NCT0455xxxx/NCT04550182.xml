  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Pressure ulcers represent a major health issue because of their high incidence and their&#xD;
      important consequences. There is an important risk of pressure ulcer acquisition for ICU&#xD;
      patients with acute organ failure(s).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific risk factors identified in ICU are immobility, which accentuates the effects of&#xD;
      friction and shears, as well as mechanical ventilation and the use of vasopressors.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A repositioning schedule is a guideline for pressure ulcer prevention, but repositioning&#xD;
      frequency remains unknown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Adaptation of the repositioning schedule to pressure ulcer risk assessment using Braden scale&#xD;
      should decrease the emergence of pressure ulcer. This could limit their important&#xD;
      consequences for ICU patients which add to their brittle clinical condition (infection,&#xD;
      increased length of stay, mortality…).&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This is a multicenter randomized controlled cluster, parallel open study. In order to avoid a&#xD;
      contamination bias between groups, this trial will be randomized at the center level. This&#xD;
      randomization will lead to the formation of 2 groups: a group of control centers (usual care)&#xD;
      and a group of interventional centers (repositioning schedule).&#xD;
&#xD;
      A visit to set up the study will be carried out before the beginning of the inclusions.&#xD;
      During this visit, a training course will be delivered to the caregivers of all the research&#xD;
      centers on the risk assessment of pressure ulcers using the Braden scale, the evaluation of&#xD;
      the skin condition, the identification of the stages of pressure and their management as well&#xD;
      as the collection of data necessary for this study. In addition, the interventional group&#xD;
      centers will receive training on the application of the repositioning schedule.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The risk assessment for pressure ulcers using the Braden scale will be performed daily in&#xD;
      both groups. All patients participating in research with a Braden scale ≤ 17 will benefit&#xD;
      from a pressure ulcer prevention mattress.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Usual care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the control group, repositioning schedule frequencies and positioning will be done&#xD;
      according to the habits of the service. The daily collection form present in the room will&#xD;
      collect information concerning the care related to the positioning of the patient (length of&#xD;
      treatment, frequency of positioning, type of positioning, any adverse events occurring during&#xD;
      this care), the evaluation of the patients 'cutaneous status, duration of pressure ulcer care&#xD;
      and evaluation of the Braden scale. The possible contraindications to the positioning of the&#xD;
      patients will be informed by the doctors on the medical prescription according to the current&#xD;
      practice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Repositioning schedule:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the interventional group the repositioning schedule will be applied according to the&#xD;
      risk of pressure ulcer evaluated daily by the Braden scale. A medical prescription, as part&#xD;
      of the care, will attest to the absence of absolute contraindication or relative to the&#xD;
      procedure of mobilization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Depending on the result of the Braden scale, the repositioning schedule is defined as&#xD;
      follows:&#xD;
&#xD;
      6 ≥ Braden ≤ 8: alternate positioning every 2 hours; 9 ≥Braden ≤ 13: alternate positioning&#xD;
      every 4 hours; 14 ≥ Braden ≤ 17: No alternative of the positioning required, but a friction&#xD;
      and an evaluation of the cutaneous state every 6 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      18 ≥Braden ≤ 23: No alternative of the positioning required, but a friction and an evaluation&#xD;
      of the cutaneous state every 12 hours&#xD;
