  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim is to investigate the impact of prostate and colorectal cancer on mitochondrial&#xD;
      quantity and quality along with muscle mass and function and whether this can be modified&#xD;
      through the use of a home-based short-term exercise training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators aim to recruit participants awaiting curative surgery for colorectal and&#xD;
      prostate cancer and to assess the variation in baseline mitochondrial activity between them.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants from both cancer types will then carry out a 4 week home exercise program, this&#xD;
      will be randomly allocated to either resistance-based or high-intensity interval training&#xD;
      based. Participants will then be re-assessed on the day of their planned surgical procedure&#xD;
      to assess the changes effected by the training program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that there will be variation in mitochondrial activity linked&#xD;
      to muscle mass across the two cancer types and that home-based exercise programs have the&#xD;
      ability to improve mitochondrial activity along with muscle mass.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Participants will be recruited from surgical outpatient clinics following an initial&#xD;
      introduction to the trial by their clinical team. At this point, participants will be&#xD;
      provided with a participant information sheet. Contact details will be provided on the&#xD;
      information sheet to enable potential participants to arrange a screening visit. The&#xD;
      screening visit would entail a detailed description of all study elements and addressing any&#xD;
      questions prior to gaining written consent. Once the patient provides written informed&#xD;
      consent, they will undergo a full cardiovascular examination by a medically qualified&#xD;
      research team member and will have a set of screening bloods taken.&#xD;
&#xD;
      D2O Instructions 24 hours prior to the study day, participants will be asked to consume a&#xD;
      stable isotope tracer drink (D2O) at a 3 ml/kg priming dose at home. Participants will be&#xD;
      asked to provide saliva samples immediately prior to D2O consumption and a further sample&#xD;
      2-hours post-consumption. Participants will be provided with written instructions, the tracer&#xD;
      drinks, and collection receptacles at their screening visit or via postal delivery for them&#xD;
      to collect these samples at home. Participants will also be provided with a smaller&#xD;
      maintenance dose (1.5ml/kg) to maintain D2O enrichment throughout the training program. This&#xD;
      will need to be consumed once per week, with saliva collected immediately prior to, and&#xD;
      2-hours post-consumption each week - again, all materials and written instructions will be&#xD;
      provided.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Pre-Exercise study day Participants will attend the University of Nottingham Graduate Entry&#xD;
      Medical School at the Royal Derby hospital for an assessment visit prior to the commencement&#xD;
      of their training protocol. Participants will be asked to arrive starved from 03:00 of the&#xD;
      day, this is to match the nil-by-mouth rules required for their surgical procedure to ensure&#xD;
      that all assessments are performed on the same fed-state. On arrival, they will undergo a&#xD;
      limited number of physical function assessments (including time up and go, handgrip strength,&#xD;
      and the short performance physical battery test).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Followed by the Ruffier test to provide an estimated cardiopulmonary fitness[14]. The ruffier&#xD;
      test is performed by the participant resting for 5 minutes (lying down) then taking note of&#xD;
      the resting heart rate. The participant then performs up to 30 standing squats within&#xD;
      45seconds, with a heart rate taken immediately upon completion. The participant then lies&#xD;
      back down for 2 minutes with further heart rate measurement. This allows us to calculate the&#xD;
      Ruffier Dicksons index which provides an estimated cardiopulmonary fitness[15].&#xD;
&#xD;
      Ruffier Dickson index (RDI): ((P1-70)+ 2(P2-P0))/10 Where P0 is 15 s average resting HR, in&#xD;
      our case, from 3 min 45 s to 4 min, P1 is the maximum HR recorded during the first 15 s of&#xD;
      recovery, and P2 is the 15 s average after the 1st minute of recovery, that is from 1 min and&#xD;
      00 s and 1 min and 15 s.&#xD;
&#xD;
      An ultrasound scan of the thigh to assess muscle architecture will then be performed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A muscle biopsy will be taken from the mid-belly of m. vastus lateralis using a conchotome&#xD;
      biopsy technique. Biopsies will be taken by medically qualified doctors trained and&#xD;
      experienced in this procedure. The procedure will be performed under aseptic conditions.&#xD;
      After local anesthetic; a 5-10mm incision will be made in the skin and underlying fascia and&#xD;
      a sample of muscle will be taken (approximately 150mg). Direct pressure will be applied to&#xD;
      achieve hemostasis. A single absorbable suture will be placed to allow skin apposition and&#xD;
      healing. A sterile dressing and compression bandage will be applied to remain in place for&#xD;
      the duration of the day. The suture will dissolve around 7-10 days after the biopsy was&#xD;
      taken. The biopsy sample will be assessed using an Oroboros respirometer for the primary&#xD;
      endpoint of mitochondrial activity, analysed by western blotting, PCR and&#xD;
      immunohistochemistry to determine cell signalling and gene expression.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will then be provided with a complimentary snack, and asked to complete quality&#xD;
      of life questionnaires (EQ-5D and IPAQ). Participants will be randomly allocated to either&#xD;
      the training arm of the study or to routine care at this point. The training regimen will&#xD;
      then be demonstrated to them with time allowed for questions regarding the training regimen.&#xD;
      This will conclude this study day.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Training program:&#xD;
&#xD;
      All exercise training will take place in the participants own home. With a documentation pack&#xD;
      provided to participants to guide exercise and for participants to log their workouts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be asked to perform 3 workouts per week over the 4-week period (12 workouts&#xD;
      in total) with each workout estimated to take 30 minutes maximum.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants randomly allocated to the resistance group will be provided with a set of&#xD;
      resistance bands to provide resistance to their workout.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As well as the education session provided at the pre-exercise study day, participants will be&#xD;
      contacted weekly via telephone or video call to provide support, encourage participation,&#xD;
      answer any difficulties participants maybe experiencing, and to ensure no adverse symptoms&#xD;
      are being experienced. A video will be recorded of a member of the research team performing&#xD;
      the exercise regimen to enable participants to watch from home.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the RET arm, the session will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 min warm-up jogging on the spot 2 sets of 12-15 repetitions of: Squats Hip flexion Hip&#xD;
      extension Hip abduction Seated row Bench press Lateral raises 2 min jogging on the spot&#xD;
      cooldown.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each exercise will be separated by 1-minute rest, with participants encouraged to workout to&#xD;
      mild fatigue on their final repetition in each set. If able to perform more than the&#xD;
      allocated maximum of 15 repetitions prior to fatigue, then participants will be informed to&#xD;
      increase the resistance by using a tougher resistance band.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For participants in the HIIT arm, the session will include:&#xD;
&#xD;
      2 min warm-up: jogging on the spot Each of the following exercises performed for 60seconds,&#xD;
      interspaced by 90 seconds rest Star jumps Standing squats On-the-spot sprints Standing squats&#xD;
      Star jumps 2 min cool-down: jogging on the spot&#xD;
&#xD;
      Our research group has conducted many similar exercise regimes of this intensity to subjects&#xD;
      in the anticipated age-range without incident. Participants will be advised to terminate&#xD;
      exercise training immediately if experiencing:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Chest pain or tightness Faintness Sudden pallor Loss of co-ordination Confusion Dizziness&#xD;
      Palpitations Sudden breathlessness&#xD;
&#xD;
      Should any participant experience these effects during any session, they will be advised to&#xD;
      seek urgent medical attention and will be withdrawn from the study for safety purposes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day of surgery study day All participants will attend for their operations fasted as per the&#xD;
      clinical teams' instructions, this is to be starved 6-hours prior to anticipated surgical&#xD;
      start time, in line with anesthetic guidelines. Participants will be met by a member of the&#xD;
      research team on their arrival, who will perform the following assessments during the time&#xD;
      prior to their surgery. Participants will first have an ultrasound scan of the thigh to&#xD;
      assess muscle architecture. Following this, participants will be asked to complete a&#xD;
      quality-of-life questionnaire (EQ-5D) and a self-administered short-form international&#xD;
      physical activity questionnaire (IPAQ). The sputum samples collected at home will be received&#xD;
      from the participants by a researcher. Participants will then perform physical function&#xD;
      assessments to determine muscle function, including the timed-up-and-go test, and the short&#xD;
      performance physical battery test, and the ruffier test to provide an estimated VO2. These&#xD;
      assessments will all be completed by a member of the research team prior to the participant&#xD;
      being taken to theatre and will not delay a participant's surgical start time, nor will it&#xD;
      require participants to arrive earlier than patients not undertaking the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once the participant has been anesthetized for their planned surgical procedure, a member of&#xD;
      the research team perform venipuncture to gather samples for analysis of myokine expression,&#xD;
      this will be followed by a single muscle biopsy. The muscle biopsy will be taken from the mid&#xD;
      belly of m. vastus lateralis using the conchotome biopsy technique as previously described.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Day 21-28 post-surgery Participants will be contacted by postal survey and asked to complete&#xD;
      a further EQ-5D and IPAQ questionnaire, along with a study feedback questionnaire to&#xD;
      ascertain participants views on the study and their exercise program.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As detailed above, in addition to their normal treatments, patients will potentially undergo&#xD;
      the following invasive or potentially harmful tests from involvement in the study (risks&#xD;
      outlined in Risk section): three blood tests and 2 muscle biopsies.&#xD;
