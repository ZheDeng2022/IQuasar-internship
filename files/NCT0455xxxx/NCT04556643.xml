      To determine effectiveness of breathing exercises for pregnant women during the second stage&#xD;
      of labor on maternal pain, duration of labor, dyspnea, oxygen saturation (SPO2) and the&#xD;
      first-minute Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration (APGAR) scores&#xD;

    <textblock>
      This study is about to determine effectiveness of breathing exercises for pregnant women&#xD;
      during the second stage of labor on maternal pain, duration of labor, dyspnea, oxygen&#xD;
      saturation SPO2 and the first-minute Appearance, Pulse, Grimace, Activity and Respiration&#xD;
      (APGAR) scores.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Two sessions will be given to pregnant women in Intervention group. One session breathing&#xD;
      exercises training will be given during first stage of labor by the investigator. During&#xD;
      training all participants in Intervention group will be instructed to perform breathing&#xD;
      exercises during the second stage of labor. The main components of breathing exercises during&#xD;
      training will be as fellows (A) First, fill your stomach and then your lungs with air while&#xD;
      breathing in; (B) Feel the expansion in the stomach; (C) Make sure the muscles from your&#xD;
      stomach to your knee are relaxed, as if you are urinating while breathing out; (D) When there&#xD;
      is pain, perform deep abdominal breathing exercises, and take a deep breath in and hold as&#xD;
      much as you can; (E) Try to push the baby downward; (F) You can do it by holding your breath&#xD;
      or breathing out quite slowly from your mouth; (G) The most important point in this stage is&#xD;
      that you should not fill up the stomach with air, and you should push downward to deliver the&#xD;
      baby; (H) You should continue the pushing until the pain is relieved. The participants will&#xD;
      be observed during second stage of labor and their breathing will be monitored.&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. During the second stage of labor maternal labor pain will be assessed by Visual Analogue&#xD;
           Scale.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Duration of second stage of labor will be counted by turning on the stop watch on the&#xD;
           start of second stage and it will be stopped at the end when baby will be delivered.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Dyspnea will be monitored by dyspnea scale after performing breathing exercises during&#xD;
           second stage of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Oxygen saturation will be monitored by pulse oximeter during second stage of labor.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. APGAR score of newborn will be marked in 1st minute after the birth.&#xD;

    <description>Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) is a measurement instrument that tries to measure a characteristic or attitude that is believed to range across a continuum of values and cannot easily be directly measured. It is often used in epidemiologic and clinical research to measure the intensity or frequency of various symptoms.</description>
