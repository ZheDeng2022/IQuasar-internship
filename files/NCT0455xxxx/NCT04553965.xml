  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Tooth loss in an aesthetic area is often undesired experience for the patient. Dental implant&#xD;
      offers the most long term solution for missing teeth replacement, replicating the root and&#xD;
      crown of the natural tooth. This procedure reserves both the gingival mucosa and the&#xD;
      remaining alveolar bone without damage to adjacent teeth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      According to the conventional protocol of dental implant, a period of 3-4 months is required&#xD;
      for socket healing, followed by implants insertion, then additional 3-4 months are needed for&#xD;
      implant integration with surrounding bone. Moreover, one additional step is required to load&#xD;
      the prosthetic abutment. This conventional protocol consumes extended period of time leaving&#xD;
      the patient with missing tooth. Many attempts to shorten the overall length of treatment had&#xD;
      focused on approaches of immediate or early implant placement especially in the aesthetic&#xD;
      zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The advantages of the immediate implant placement include, less surgical intervention&#xD;
      procedures, so reduction in therapy time, preservation of the bone and gingival tissues, and&#xD;
      psychological confidence for the patient. In spite of the advantage of the immediate implant&#xD;
      placement, it is still a challenging treatment option for the clinician and presents a higher&#xD;
      incidence of complications. It reported that the anatomic factors which influence the&#xD;
      outcomes of immediate implant placement at the anterior region are the gingival biotype, the&#xD;
      thickness and height of the existing alveolar bone, the amount of bone beyond the apex, and&#xD;
      the buccal gap.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following tooth extraction, high degree of resorption is expected, which is more severe in&#xD;
      the buccal alveolar wall thickness. In other words, the bone change is more suspected in the&#xD;
      buccal alveolar bone and the palatal alveolar bone is less affected area. Also it was&#xD;
      reported that the resorption of the buccal alveolar bone in the anterior are more affected&#xD;
      than posterior areas, since the bone resorption is more siginficant where the walls are&#xD;
      initially thinner. The vertical and horizontal reduction of bone dimensions is unavoidable.&#xD;
      In the first 3 months after dental extraction, this resorption is more noticeable. However,&#xD;
      bone remodeling may last for 12 months but less intense, resulting in dimensional change. In&#xD;
      some opinions, the buccal alveolar bone thickness should be at least 2 mm to prevent labial&#xD;
      gingival recession and to achieve an optimal biologic and esthetic outcome.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hence in most situations, bone augmentation procedure has been recommended with immediate&#xD;
      implant placement in the aesthetic zone.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Recently, several studies have been published discussing if there is enough thickness in the&#xD;
      labial alveolar bone for immediate implant placement in an anterior maxillary region.&#xD;
      Nevertheless, the existing studies only include anterior teeth. There is not enough research&#xD;
      regarding the premolars although they play a role in the aesthetic region.Therefore, this&#xD;
      study is designed to investigate the thickness of the buccal alveolar bone of maxillary&#xD;
      anterior and premolar teeth in a sample of Egyptian population using Cone beam computed&#xD;
      tomography (CBCT) at different levels that are clinically relevant.&#xD;

      -  Retrospective Data Analysis will be performed after the CBCT images are pooled from the&#xD;
           computer database of &quot;Dokki radiology center&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Scans scanned using PaX-i3D Green VATECH with 0.2 voxel resolution will be examined.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Exposure parameters of the scans was varied depending on the individual patient's sizes.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  CBCT images will be analysed using OnDemand3D ® DENTAL (Cybermed, Seoul, Korea) using&#xD;
           the 3D module. In the axial plane, the reference line will be oriented to pass through&#xD;
           the center of the examined tooth perpendicular to the long axis of the tooth and buccal&#xD;
           alveolar bone. The long axis of the tooth will dictate the orientation of the vertical&#xD;
           slice. Bone thickness will be measured from the sagittal cross sectional cut where the&#xD;
           CEJ will be identified and followed by the measurements in 3 different locations (figure&#xD;
           3): A, 1 mm apical to alveolar crest ; B, 3 mm from the alveolar crest; and C, 5 mm away&#xD;
           from alveolar crest.&#xD;
