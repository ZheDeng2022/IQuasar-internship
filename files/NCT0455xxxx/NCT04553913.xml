  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Participation in this study will involve having a pad wrapped onto the subject's non-surgical&#xD;
      leg to detect when sensation returns after spinal anesthetic and while in recovery room. The&#xD;
      pad is part of an approved medical device, but which has been modified and will be used in an&#xD;
      experimental way. The device will run cold water through the pad wrapped to the subject's&#xD;
      leg. The subject will be asked to press a stop button when they feel the pad gets cold.&#xD;
      Nurses in the recovery area will also be testing return of sensation using a standard&#xD;
      technique and this will be compared to when the subject begins to feel the cold.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Regional anesthesia investigators have always shown interest in measuring the specific&#xD;
      duration of neuraxial or peripheral nerve blocks, and how variations in block technique or&#xD;
      medications affect that duration. Although ostensibly a simple concept, there are many&#xD;
      sensory modalities available for block testing (light touch, cold or hot temperature, pain,&#xD;
      pressure, etc.) and there is no consensus in the anesthesia literature on how best to measure&#xD;
      the duration of nerve block (. Sensory testing is repetitive, and must be practical and&#xD;
      consistent. Pinprick and cold sensation are commonly employed, and these modalities share the&#xD;
      same afferent fibers (C-delta) so there is close overlap in the sensory loss mapping after&#xD;
      regional block. With respect to pinprick sensation there can be variability in the sharpness,&#xD;
      pressure, and reproducibility of a pinprick test. Testing for cold sensation may be more&#xD;
      consistent, using a controlled stimulus temperature and duration, and there are different&#xD;
      methods of testing such as a cooled glass vial (5℃) or Rolltemp (25℃).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Testing for long-acting blocks overnight adds an additional challenge since it requires&#xD;
      repetitive subject awakening for assessment, and the interval for testing is a compromise&#xD;
      between test specificity and sleep disruption. Again, there is no consensus on the proper&#xD;
      interval for testing recovery from regional block.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Cold therapy is a commonly applied modality following strenuous exercise or during recovery&#xD;
      from extremity surgery, and is expected to reduce tissue damage and relieve pain. There is&#xD;
      some evidence of benefit but little consensus on the optimum interval and duration of&#xD;
      therapy, and there are many approved medical devices available for use.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This investigation proposes an adaptation of an approved cold therapy device to administer&#xD;
      automated, periodic cold stimulus at a location made insensate by regional block. When the&#xD;
      subject perceives cold at that site, they will press a stop switch to discontinue cooling&#xD;
      which will also stop a timer and give an accurate duration of the time to recovery of&#xD;
      sensation at that site.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The concept will be tested by comparing the duration measured to the standard measurement of&#xD;
      recovery from nerve block (spinal) employed by post-anesthesia care unit (PACU) nurses who&#xD;
      will use pinprick (toothpick) testing of lumbar dermatomes every thirty minutes. If the&#xD;
      device shows acceptable agreement with standard block recovery testing, a follow-up study&#xD;
      would be its evaluation for long-duration block testing as an alternative to research&#xD;
      assistant repeated testing overnight.&#xD;
