    <textblock>
      This study is a prospective randomized controlled study of different arthroscopic treatments&#xD;
      for refractory external humeral epicondylitis combined with platelet rich plasma (PRP)&#xD;
      injection. The patients with intractable external humeral epicondylitis were randomly divided&#xD;
      into groups before the operation. After the arthroscopic operation was completed, they were&#xD;
      divided into a local PRP injection group and a control group (normal saline) to perform&#xD;
      additional operations on the damaged tendons, each for up to half a year after the operation.&#xD;
      In different time periods, the quantitative and qualitative indicators including pain,&#xD;
      functional score, muscle strength, MRI performance, etc. were compared between groups at the&#xD;
      same time period to evaluate the difference in the effect of arthroscopic treatment combined&#xD;
      with PRP on the treatment of damaged tendons. Determine the effectiveness of PRP. At the same&#xD;
      time, in the process of arthroscopic treatment, look for risk factors that affect the&#xD;
      curative effect of intractable external humeral epicondylitis, as well as the causes and&#xD;
      prevention of common complications.&#xD;
