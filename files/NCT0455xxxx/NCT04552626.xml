  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The main aim for this study is to investigate to what extent physical activity of moderate or&#xD;
      low intensity, relative to prolonged inactivity, may acutely alter neural activity-related&#xD;
      prefrontal cortex oxygenated hemoglobin during a cognitive demanding task in 13- 15 year-old&#xD;
      adolescents. The study is primarily focused on investigating these effects in ecologically&#xD;
      valid conditions, i.e. activity patterns that closely resemble a typical day in school and&#xD;
      using activity modes that are suitable in a school setting.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study will be a controlled crossover experimental trial with three conditions. Each&#xD;
      participant will complete each of the three experimental conditions, separated by a washout&#xD;
      period of minimum four days. Physical activity behaviours and sleep will be monitored the&#xD;
      day/night before each test day. The first visit will be a familiarization session for the&#xD;
      collection of demographic data, fitness testing, and acquaintance with experimental&#xD;
      procedures. On the second, third, and fourth visits, participants will undergo three&#xD;
      different standardized 80-minutes interventions in a randomized order. Before and immediately&#xD;
      after the 80-minutes interventions, blood pressure, augmentation index, and cerebral&#xD;
      hemodynamic response of the prefrontal cortex during standardized cognitive tasks (nback&#xD;
      test) will be measured. Additionally, saliva samples will be collected the morning of the&#xD;
      test day, and before and after the interventions.&#xD;

    <description>Participants are required to sit for 80 minutes doing schoolwork, with a toilet break in between. Every twenty minutes participants will have a physical activity break, where they will perform a simple moderate-intensity step-up exercise for three minutes at a predetermined pace. Test day begins at 8:00 with pretest measures, followed by the intervention at about 9:30, which will end around 12:00, with subsequent posttest measures.</description>

    <description>Participants are required to sit for 80 minutes doing schoolwork, with a toilet break in between. Every twenty minutes participants will have a physical activity break, where they will perform simple resistance activities following a video for about three minutes. Test day begins at 8:00 with pretest measures, followed by the intervention at about 9:30, which will end around 12:00, with subsequent posttest measures.</description>
