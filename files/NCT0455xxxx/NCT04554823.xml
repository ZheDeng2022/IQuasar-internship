    <textblock>
      According to the National Cancer Institute (INCA), the estimate for Brazil, 2016-2017&#xD;
      biennium, points to the occurrence of about 600,000 new cases of cancer, and breast cancer&#xD;
      (58000) in women will be the most frequent. One study revealed that only 12% of women&#xD;
      undergoing chemotherapy in CM who participated in a physical exercise program had to&#xD;
      readjusted the dose of the medications, while 34% of those who received the conventional&#xD;
      treatment needed to readjust the Treatment doses, with neuropathy being one of the most&#xD;
      present adverse effects that influenced this adjustment. In this sense, the conduct to keep&#xD;
      the patient at rest during the treatment seems to potentiate her side effects, and&#xD;
      sedentarism is another factor detrimental to the patient's health. Objective: To verify the&#xD;
      effect of the intervention of a program of physical exercises and health education in women&#xD;
      with breast cancer undergoing chemotherapy. Methodology: A sample will consist of 136 (136)&#xD;
      Women, over 18 years of age, sedentary, diagnosed with non-metastatic breast cancer and&#xD;
      initiating the first cycle of chemotherapy. They will be divided into two groups, randomly&#xD;
      and stratified: control group: (CG n = 68) and exercise group: (eg n = 68) that will undergo&#xD;
      a supervised training program of combined exercises for 24 weeks, with a frequency of 3 times&#xD;
      Weekly and duration of 60 minutes, an unsupervised flexibility training program 2 times a&#xD;
      week and both groups (GC and EG) will attend lectures on health education, which are held&#xD;
      monthly.&#xD;
