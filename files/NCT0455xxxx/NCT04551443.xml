      Cumulative evidence has demonstrated that cardiac repair after acute myocardial infarction&#xD;
      (AMI) is characterized by a series of time-dependent events orchestrated by the innate immune&#xD;
      system. This begins immediately after the onset of necrotic cell death with intense sterile&#xD;
      inflammation and myocardial infiltration of a variety of immune cell subtypes including&#xD;
      monocytes and macrophages during the first several days after MI. There is increasing&#xD;
      evidence to suggest inflammation is not limited to the infarcted myocardium and systemic&#xD;
      imbalances in the post-infarct inflammatory cascade can exacerbate adverse remodelling beyond&#xD;
      the infarct site. Therefore, it is very important that therapies seek to target the intricate&#xD;
      balance between pro- and antiinflammatory pathways timely after AMI. Human mesenchymal stem&#xD;
      cells (hMSCs) have been shown to exhibit immunomodulation, angiogenesis, and paracrine&#xD;
      secretion of bioactive factors that can attenuate inflammation and promote tissue&#xD;
      regeneration, making them a promising cell source for AMI therapy. However, it has been&#xD;
      proved in our and other studies that perfusion of WJMSCs after 5 days of AMI can only&#xD;
      slightly improve left ventricular end-diastolic volume, which is the most important indicator&#xD;
      of left ventricular remodeling. Thus, WANIAMI Trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo&#xD;
      controlled, phase#study designed to assess the safety and feasibility of intravenous infusion&#xD;
      of WJMSCs in the treatment of patients in the acute phase ( within 24h) with the both of&#xD;
      ST-Segment-Elevation or Non-ST-Segment-Elevation AMI.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      At present, although the implementation of timely reperfusion strategies has reduced the&#xD;
      acute mortality associated with AMI, improved patient survival has increased the incidence of&#xD;
      chronic heart failure, due in large part to adverse remodeling of the damaged left ventricle&#xD;
      (LV) following the initial ischemic event. However, recently, pathophysiological mechanisms&#xD;
      of AMI reveal that begins immediately after the onset of necrotic cell death with intense&#xD;
      sterile inflammation and myocardial infiltration of a variety of immune cell subtypes&#xD;
      including neutrophils, monocytes and macrophages during the first several days after MI.&#xD;
      Improved understanding in the interactions between cells, extracellular matrix (ECM) and&#xD;
      signaling molecules within the injured myocardium have allowed development of novel&#xD;
      experimental therapies. These therapies seek to target the intricate balance between pro- and&#xD;
      anti-inflammatory pathways in an attempt to limit ischemic injury and prevent subsequent&#xD;
      development of heart failure. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), in particular, have emerged as&#xD;
      potent paracrine modulators of inflammation that promote myocardial healing after infarction.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The latest cell biological studies have demonstrated that mesenchymal stem cells have a&#xD;
      unique immunomodulatory function. MSCs contribute to a critical role in regulating the&#xD;
      inflammatory microenvironment and interacting with immune cells, including T cells, B cells,&#xD;
      natural killer (NK) cells, and dendritic cells (DCs). MSC induce anti- inflammatory&#xD;
      macrophages, inhibit foam cell formation, suppress immune responses of endothelial cells and&#xD;
      innate lymphoid cells, and increase phagocytic capacity, which indirectly suppresses T cell&#xD;
      proliferation. In mouse AMI models, we found MSCs transplantation significantly reduced the&#xD;
      number of inflammatory macrophages (M1), increased the number of anti-inflammatory&#xD;
      macrophages (M2) and prevented the expansion of AMI during early stage of AMI. More recently,&#xD;
      the paracrine potency might vary with sources and microenvironment of MSCs. MSCs isolated&#xD;
      from fetal tissues such as umbilical cord (UC) and UC-blood (UCB) were shown to have&#xD;
      increased secretion of anti-inflammatory factors (TGF-β,IL-10) and growth factors than MSCs&#xD;
      obtained from adult adipose tissue or bone marrow. Our previous research found that the&#xD;
      expression characteristics of special immunomodulatory genes of human umbilical cord&#xD;
      Wharton's jelly-derived MSCs (WJMSCs). At present, many studies have demonstrated WJMSC&#xD;
      possess s a robust immunomodulatory potential and anti-inflammatory effects through release&#xD;
      of secretome consisting of a diverse range of cytokines, chemokines, and extracellular&#xD;
      vesicles (EVs), the cross talk and interplay of WJMSCs and local environment reversely&#xD;
      control and regulate the paracrine activity of MSCs. Thus WJMSCs are important regulators of&#xD;
      immune responses and may hold great potential to be used as a therapeutic in AMI. In&#xD;
      particular#safety and feasibility of WJMSCs transplant have been clearly proved by us and&#xD;
      other studies in patients with AMI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Given the current evidence, systemic paracrinemediated anti-inflammatory effects of WJMSCs&#xD;
      can drive beneficial in therapy of AMI. These concepts lead to a potentially transformative&#xD;
      strategy that intravenous delivery of WJMSCs, through systemic anti-infammatory mechanisms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Therefore, the investigators performed a double-blind, placebo- controlled trial, randomly&#xD;
      assigning 200 patients with AMI to receive three times at 30-day intervals for equal doses of&#xD;
      1x106 /kg of WJMSCs, first time infusing within 24h after AMI or placebo , to investigate the&#xD;
      therapeutic efficacy and safety of WJMSCs in patients with acute ST-Segment-Elevation or&#xD;
      Non-ST-Segment-elevation myocardial infarction.&#xD;
