  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Acute viral bronchiolitis (BE) is an inflammatory disease of the lower respiratory tract,&#xD;
      with a viral etiology, where the respiratory syncytial virus is the most prevalent agent.&#xD;
      Respiratory physiotherapy (FTR) aims to remove airway obstruction, which decreases airway&#xD;
      resistance, improves gas exchange, and reduces respiratory load. It is widely used in the&#xD;
      treatment of children with chronic respiratory disease, but has long been debated as a&#xD;
      treatment for bronchiolitis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is to evaluate the effectiveness of two mucociliary clearance&#xD;
      techniques in non-hospitalized children &lt;12 months with a first episode of moderate BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This is a clinical trial that aims to recruit patients from 2 to 12 months who attend the&#xD;
      Physiobronchial physiotherapy centers in Madrid, A Coruña, and Barcelona with a first-time&#xD;
      medical diagnosis of BQ of 48 hours of maximum evolution. Participants will be randomly&#xD;
      assigned into 3 groups: Group A: Assisted Autogenous Drainage (DAA), Group B: Prolonged Slow&#xD;
      Expiration (ELPr) and Control Group. The main variables are oxygen saturation (SaO2), the&#xD;
      Wang severity scale (WS), the modified Wood-Downes scale (WD-S), the Acute Bronchiolitis&#xD;
      Severity Scale (ESBA), the Hospital scale Sant Joan de Déu (HSJD) and the ReSVinet Scale&#xD;
      (RSV-S), and will be measured by a blinded evaluator at the beginning of the session (T0), 20&#xD;
      minutes after administering short-acting β2 adrenergic agonist (SABA) (T20 ), immediately&#xD;
      after nebulization (T40) and at the end of the physiotherapist's intervention (T60). It will&#xD;
      be reassessed 48 hours after the session (T48h) and the protocol will be repeated completely&#xD;
      if it has not dropped at least two points according to the scales.&#xD;

      The main objective of the present work is to evaluate the effectiveness of two mucociliary&#xD;
      clearance techniques in non-hospitalized children &lt;12 months with a first episode of moderate&#xD;
      BE.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Once each patient legal guardians has signed the informed consent document and it has been&#xD;
      verified that the inclusion criteria are met, participants will be assigned the same&#xD;
      identification number (ID) that is related to its Clinical History (CH) by simple coding;&#xD;
      custody of the file with the relationship of each ID with its CH will be the responsibility&#xD;
      of the principal investigator. The method of blinding in the allocation will be performed by&#xD;
      choosing opaque sealed envelopes by a person external to the study. The contents of the&#xD;
      envelopes will be the random assignment cards to each of the three groups, this simple random&#xD;
      numerical sequence will be generated by computer using the R program see 3.5.1. (R Foundation&#xD;
      for Statistical Computing,Institute for Statistics and Mathematics, Welthandelsplatz 1, 1020&#xD;
      Vienna, Austria) based on stratified sampling for homogeneity, in three groups:Group A:&#xD;
      assisted autogenous drainage group (DAA), group B: group prolonged slow expiration (ELPr),&#xD;
      group C: control group (CG).&#xD;
&#xD;
      None of the children that make up both intervention group A and B, and the control group,&#xD;
      will be prohibited from the usual pharmacological treatment prescribed by their doctor. It&#xD;
      will collect in the investigator's notebook the medications that each patient has prescribed&#xD;
      by their doctor. Physiotherapists cannot prescribe drugs, but can administer them at the&#xD;
      beginning of the protocol after the prescription by the doctor.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Within the protocol, the short-acting β2 adrenergic agonist (SABA) will be administered,&#xD;
      prior to nebulization with 4 ml Muconeb® 3% hypertonic serum, for 8 minutes in a Philips®&#xD;
      vibrating mesh nebulizer. Next, following protocols will be applied:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention based on DAA Group A: the technique consists of positioning the patient in&#xD;
           a supine position with the head slightly elevated on the supporting plane and then&#xD;
           placing both hands around the rib cage and applying bimanual expiratory compression on&#xD;
           both hemithoraxes. The physiotherapist must ensure that the child takes 2 to 3&#xD;
           controlled breaths, close to the residual level, with the objective that the expiratory&#xD;
           flow displaces the secretions, located distally, towards the central airways.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention based on ELPr Group B: this technique applied to the baby by means of a&#xD;
           slow thoracic-abdominal pressure that begins at the end of a spontaneous expiration and&#xD;
           continues until the residual volume. The physiotherapist through the provoked cough or&#xD;
           stimulation of the trachea achieves the expectoration of the sputum.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Group C: nebulization with 4 ml Muconeb® 3% hypertonic serum, for 8 minutes in a&#xD;
           Philips® vibrating mesh nebulizer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The timing of intervention protocol will be followed: a) The SABA prescribed by the doctor&#xD;
      will be administered to all patients; b) 20 minutes later the patient will then receive an&#xD;
      8-minute nebulization of Muconeb® 3% hypertonic solution; c) The treatment techniques&#xD;
      protocol will consist of a standard 20 minute session based on nasal washes and the protocols&#xD;
      descrive above for each intervention group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Both groups will receive 3 evaluations by an investigator who will be blinded on the&#xD;
      treatment and the objectives. The evaluations will be carried out at the beginning of the&#xD;
      session (T0), 20 minutes after the SABA administration (T20), after the nebulization of&#xD;
      Muconeb® 3% hypertonic solution (T30), after intervention treatment protocol (T60) and,&#xD;
      finially, after 48 hours from ending treatment session (T48).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The main variables will classify the participants according to the initial clinical severity&#xD;
      score proposed by Wang (WS), the Wood-Downes Scale modified by Ferres (WDF-S) the Acute&#xD;
      Bronchiolitis Severity Scale (ESBA), the Scale of the Sant Joan de Déu Hospital (HSJD) and&#xD;
      the ReSVinet Scale (RSV-S). HR is a variable that is collected on the HSJD and WDS scales.&#xD;
      SaO2 is included in the HSJD and ESBA scale, both will be measured through a pulse oximeter&#xD;
      (Radical Touchscreen from Massimo®, Masimo Corporation, Irvine, CA).&#xD;

    <measure>Wood-Downes scale modified by Ferres</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Is a quantitative cumulative scale designed to assess clinical severity in patients with BQ. The clinical severity scoring system consists of six items: wheezing, circulation, respiratory rate (RF), heart rate (HR), ventilation, and cyanosis. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, the values of each item are added together and a total result of (1-3) mild, (4-7) moderate and (&gt; 8) severe is obtained, with 14 being the maximum score and 0 the minimum. A higher score indicates a worse condition.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>ReSVinet Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>48 hours</time_frame>
    <description>Is a recently designed quantitative cumulative scale to assess clinical severity in patients with BE. It has the peculiarity of having two versions so that it can be passed by a health professional and / or also by the parents or relatives of the patients. The scoring system for both versions is made up of seven items: food intolerance, medical intervention, respiratory distress, RF, apnea, general condition and fever. Each item is scored from 0 to 3, the values of each item are added and a total result of (0-6) mild, (7-13) moderate and (14-20) severe is obtained, with 20 being the maximum score and 0 the minimum. A higher score indicates a worse condition.</description>
