  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The aim of this study is to assess the efficacy of a short term compensatory cognitive group&#xD;
      intervention - the Compensatory Cognitive Training (CCT) among people with severe mental&#xD;
      illnesses, receiving ambulatory treatment&#xD;
    </textblock>

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      This study includes two experimental arms to research cognitive compensatory group treatment&#xD;
      in severe mental illness population. The study consists of 4 primary phases: recruitment,&#xD;
      assessment, intervention and post-intervention assessment. Two arms involve an ambulatory&#xD;
      participants. participants are assigned to an intervention or control group according to the&#xD;
      order of recruitment. Assessment and post-assessment phases include assessments of functional&#xD;
      capacity, cognitive functions and severity of symptoms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Intervention includes 12 group sessions in a small group of five participants, focusing on&#xD;
      learning compensatory strategies aimed to improve attention, concentration, learning, memory,&#xD;
      organization, and problem-solving in order to improve everyday functioning. Interventions&#xD;
      will be performed in addition to standard ambulatory treatment. The control group will&#xD;
      receive standard ambulatory treatment only.&#xD;

    <description>COGNISTAT is a cognitive screening test for 3 basic cognitive functions: Orientation, Attention, Memory Registration and 5 major cognitive functions: Language (Comprehension, Repetition, Naming), Constructional Ability, Memory, Calculation Skills, Executive Skills (Reasoning, Judgment). The final scores for the subtests ranges from 0 (severe impairment) to 4, 6, 8 or 12 (average range)</description>
