  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Eliminating media use is neither feasible at a public health level nor perhaps even desirable&#xD;
      given the role it plays in the lives of youth and adults, but mind-body interventions have&#xD;
      the potential to mitigate state arousal effects and thus reduce negative impacts on sleep.&#xD;
      Given emerging literature on links between intensive media use, sensory and interoceptive&#xD;
      awareness, and self-regulation, this study will examine two related mind-body approaches -- a&#xD;
      mindfulness sensory awareness exercises and mindful body awareness check-ins -- in a&#xD;
      randomized clinical trial of early adolescents with evening media use and sleep problems.&#xD;

    <description>The PSAS-C (PreSleep Arousal Scale, modified for Children) is a 16-item scale that has been successfully used to assess perceived cognitive and somatic arousal at bedtime in children ages 8-14; and the adult version (PSAS) has been shown to be a significant mediator of the relationship between evening media use and sleep in adolescents and young adults, and been used to test state arousal mechanisms of mindfulness interventions on sleep. Youth will complete this at the end of the post-exposure recovery period during each remote assessment visit. Possible scores range from 16-80, with higher scores indicating worse pre-sleep arousal levels.</description>

    <description>This will be measured as the average time across a diary week at which a youth discontinued media use for the night. If the youth fell asleep while using media use, the time of sleep onset is used.</description>

    <description>The mindfulness sensory awareness exercise will be a brief (3-5 minutes), guided meditation focusing on sensory and interoceptive awareness developed by Co-I Price, modified slightly to meet the needs of this age group and targeted for attention to indicators of fatigue or a sense of overstimulation. Youth will be asked to use the exercise after ending media use but before trying to sleep. The meditation component will be delivered via an audio-guided MP3, along with illustrated instructions in both handout and video, and a guided workbook that coaches youth over the 8-week intervention period to practice their skills, reflect on their experiences, and maintain adherence.</description>

    <description>During the intervention period for Group B: Mindful Sensory &amp; Body Awareness(the second 8 weeks), they will receive the same mindful sensory awareness intervention, and also learn the mindful body awareness check-ins to guide media use choices strategy (referred to here as the check-ins component). We will coach youth to pause briefly every 30 minutes during media use to discern if they detect physical, cognitive, or emotional signs of escalated state arousal, and to make an intentional and real-time choice about possible changes in media use content or duration to help decrease state arousal levels before bed.</description>

             will be used to download the games used in the media-induced arousal task and then&#xD;
             used to play those games with the device in airplane mode, and a second which will be&#xD;
             used to connect to the study staff via video conference, and which can be a laptop&#xD;

&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Untreated diagnosis (by parent report) or positive screen for sleep-disordered&#xD;
             breathing on the SDSC parent report survey questionnaire&#xD;
&#xD;

             report&#xD;
&#xD;
        We exclude potential participants who meet one of the following criteria because of&#xD;
        concerns that their heart rate variability response may be too atypical to be valuable in&#xD;
        this protocol (ASD or developmental delay, eating disorder, PTSD, illicit drug use) and/or&#xD;
        because of concerns that the associated behavioral challenges and/or instability would&#xD;
        impair ability to adhere to the entire 4-6 month protocol.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Diagnosis of Autism Spectrum Disorder or developmental delay by parent self-report&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of eating disorder by parent self-report&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Current diagnosis of PTSD by parent self-report&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Illicit drug use within the last three months by parent self-report&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Is currently suicidal, based on the ASQ (Ask Suicide Screening Questions)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hospitalization for depression or anxiety in the last year by parent self-report; or&#xD;
             severe current depression symptoms as indicated by a t-score &gt; 80 on the RCADS-25. We&#xD;
             will also exclude those with last year hospitalization, regardless of symptom score,&#xD;
             because this is often an indicator of instability and undertreatment, and ability to&#xD;
             adhere to the entire 4-6 month protocol would likely be impaired.&#xD;
