      This is an observational prospective study to estimate in real world conditions the&#xD;
      effectiveness, the safety profile and the pattern of use of adjuvant nivolumab in adults&#xD;
      participants with stage III/IV resected melanoma, and subsequent treatments administered in&#xD;
      case of relapse.&#xD;
