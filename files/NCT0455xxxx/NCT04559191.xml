      The OPTIMAL is a single-center, randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of CGM-based&#xD;
      glycemic control on atheroma progression in T2DM patients with CAD by using serial&#xD;
      intravascular ultrasound (IVUS) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) imaging. A total of 90&#xD;
      eligible subjects will be randomized 1:1 into 2 groups to receive either CGM-based glycemic&#xD;
      control or HbA1c-baded glycemic management. Coronary angiography and NIRS/IVUS imaging is&#xD;
      repeated at the end of the assigned treatment period.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Results: The primary endpoint is the normalized absolute change in total atheroma volume from&#xD;
      baseline to 12 months. The secondary endpoints include (1) the absolute change in percent&#xD;
      atheroma volume, (2) the percent change in lipid core burden index, (3) the change in&#xD;
      coefficient variance measured by CGM, (4) the change in atherogenic markers (high-density&#xD;
      lipoprotein functionality, proprotein convertase subxilisin/kexin type 9 and fatty-acid&#xD;
      binding proteins), and (5) the frequency of hypoglycemia. Safety will also be evaluated.&#xD;

      Enrollment of 90 patients is planned at National Cerebral &amp; Cardiovascular Center in Japan.&#xD;
      Study participants are randomly assigned to either CGM-based glucose management or&#xD;
      HbA1c-based glucose management.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible subjects should have CAD requiring elective PCI. HbA1c at screening should be&#xD;
      between 7.0 and 10.0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-culprit vessel with its severe tortuousty and/or calcification will be excluded. Subjects&#xD;
      with baseline estimated glomerular filtration rate &lt;40 mL/min/1.73m2 will not be eligible.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After informed consent has been obtained, elective PCI will be conducted to treat culprit&#xD;
      lesion. NIRS/IVUS imaging will be conducted to evaluate coronary atheroma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In the CGM-based glucose management group, CGM (FreeStyle Libre Pro®, Abbott, Chicago,&#xD;
      Illinoi, the United States) and HbA1c measurement will be undertaken at baseline and 3, 6, 9&#xD;
      and 12 months following PCI. In the HbA1c-based glucose management group, HbA1c will be&#xD;
      measured at baseline and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after PCI, and CGM will be used at baseline&#xD;
      and 12 months in a similar fashion..&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the use of anti-diabetic drugs, in the CGM-guided glycemic control group,&#xD;
      endocrinologist will select glucose lowering drugs to fulfill the following CGM-derived&#xD;
      goals: (a) the frequency of hypoglycemia=0%, (b) the coefficient of variation &lt;36% and (c)&#xD;
      averaged glucose level between 70-180 mg/dl.6 If the frequency of hypoglycemia is over 10%&#xD;
      and/or the averaged glucose level is more than 400 mg/dl, patients will be asked to visit&#xD;
      within 1 month after CGM measurement. In the HbA1c-guided therapy group, the selection of&#xD;
      glucose lowering agents will be made according to the discretion of each endocrinologist to&#xD;
      achieve HbA1c &lt;7.0%.&#xD;
&#xD;
      At 12 months following PCI, patients will be hospitalized to take follow-up coronary&#xD;
      angiography and intravascular imaging study. NIRS/IVUS imaging in the non-culprit vessel will&#xD;
      be conducted again in a similar fashion.&#xD;
