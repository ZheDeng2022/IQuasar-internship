  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      My MS Toolkit is a web-based symptom self-management program for persons with multiple&#xD;
      sclerosis (MS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study is evaluating various aspects of My MS Toolkit plus coaching and how it impacts&#xD;
      symptom self-management in multiple sclerosis. The research team believe that the toolkit&#xD;
      will be feasible, acceptable, and beneficial to participants.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Study participants will be asked to use a newly developed web-based symptom self-management&#xD;
      program, called the My MS Toolkit, for 8 weeks.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The My MS Toolkit includes 8 modules that describe symptom self-management strategies.&#xD;
      Participants will explore the My MS Toolkit, following the prompts and guides built into the&#xD;
      program, and meet with a study coach weekly for 15 to 30-minute telephone-delivered coaching&#xD;
      sessions. Participants are encouraged to practice and apply the skills learned.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study can be done from participants' homes using a reliable internet-connected device. No&#xD;
      travel is required.&#xD;

    <measure>Acceptability/Feasibility of the the coached version of My MS Toolkit</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment, approximately week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Assessed by the Participant Satisfaction Evaluation Survey. This survey is a 17 item scale with one free text item and 16 items with scores ranging from 1-4 (lowest to highest) with total scores ranging from 16-64. Higher scores indicate greater levels of acceptability.</description>

    <measure>Impact of My MS Toolkit: Change in fatigue</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and Post-treatment, approximately week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Modified Fatigue Impact Scale will be used to assess fatigue. It is a self-report survey that contains 21 items. Each item is rated 0-4. Higher scores indicate a greater impact of fatigue on a person's activities.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact My MS Toolkit: Change in pain interference as measured by The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and Post-treatment, approximately week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The Brief Pain Inventory Short Form (BPI-SF) is a 9-item questionnaire (15 prompts) with two domains: pain severity and pain interference. The 7 pain interference items have values which range from 0 (&quot;does not interfere&quot;) to 10 (&quot;completely interferes&quot;); items are averaged for a scale score range of 0-10, with higher scores indicating more pain interference.</description>

  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Impact My MS Toolkit: Change in depressive symptoms as measured by the Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and Post-treatment, approximately week 8</time_frame>
    <description>The eight-item Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ-8) is established as a valid diagnostic and severity measure for depressive disorders in large clinical studies. Scores range from 0 - 24 and a score of 10 or greater is consistent with at least moderate depressive symptoms.</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Change in self-efficacy for managing symptoms as measured by the University of Washington Self-Efficacy Scale</measure>
    <time_frame>Pre-treatment and Post-treatment, approximately week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Changes measured by the University of Washington Self-Efficacy Scale (UW-SES), higher score indicates higher levels of self-efficacy (total score range: 6-30)</description>
  </secondary_outcome>
  <secondary_outcome>
    <measure>Participant perception of change</measure>
    <time_frame>Post-treatment, approximately week 8</time_frame>
    <description>Perception of change is assessed by the patient global impression of change questionnaire, which is 1 question and responses range from 1-7. Higher numbers indicate greater improvement in condition.</description>
