  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a open-label, single-arm study to investigate the safety and efficacy of Total&#xD;
      neoadjuvant chemotherapy with camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug following short course&#xD;
      radiotherapy in patients with rectal cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients with rectal cancer are assigned to receive preoperative 5 Ã— 5 Gy irradiation over 5&#xD;
      days with total neoadjuvant chemotherapy and camrelizumab, an anti-PD-1 antibody drug. The&#xD;
      Primary Objective is to assess clinical complete response of an organ preservation approach&#xD;
      and the secondary objective to assess safety in all enrolled patients, local regrowth rate&#xD;
      and other cancer specific outcomes (metastasis-free survival, colostomy-free survival and&#xD;
      overall survival), longitudinal health-related quality of life of this organ preservation&#xD;
      approach.&#xD;
