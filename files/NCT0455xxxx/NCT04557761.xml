  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will gather information on the use of microMend® to repair lacerations in children&#xD;
      and compare the efficacy of microMend® to sutures for laceration repair. microMend® has&#xD;
      previously been shown to be less painful and easier to use than sutures, which are the&#xD;
      current standard of care for primary wound closures. Results of this research will inform how&#xD;
      the treatment of laceration repairs in the pediatric patient population.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Lacerations are typically closed with sutures, staples, tissue adhesives, or bandages. These&#xD;
      methods come with several limitations, however. Sutures and staples can be painful, cause&#xD;
      inflammation that can lead to scarring, and require return clinic visits for their removal.&#xD;
      Tissue adhesives cannot be used to close wounds under tension, can be associated with&#xD;
      inflammation, and carry a risk of wound dehiscence. Bandages are also only useful for closing&#xD;
      superficial wounds under low tension. Therefore, there is a need for improved products to&#xD;
      close wounds associated with laceration repair.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The current study will use a prospective randomized controlled design to compare the use of&#xD;
      sutures to microMend® to treat lacerations among children 7-17 years. Performance of sutures&#xD;
      and microMend® will be assessed by investigators, providers and subjects. Participants will&#xD;
      be randomized 1:1 between closure of lacerations with microMend® or sutures. Results from&#xD;
      this study will help gather further information on the use of microMend® to close wounds in&#xD;
      the pediatric population.&#xD;

    <description>The investigator will complete a questionnaire about the wound. The questionnaire will capture information about the wound including the cause of laceration, approximate length of the wound, and whether subcutaneous sutures were used prior to application of micro Mend or sutures. The questionnaire will also indicate whether local anesthesia was used.</description>

Each parameter will be determined to be Excellent, Good, Fair or Poor, which correspond to numerical ratings of 4, 3, 2, and 1, respectively.</description>

    <description>microMend® is a novel wound closure device that consists of arrays of tiny staples, known as Microstaples, which are attached to a backing material that is the size and shape of a butterfly closure. The Microstaples enable secure attachment of the device to the skin, allowing for the safe closure of wounds associated with surgery and traumatic injuries, such as lacerations. microMend is listed with the FDA and is available for sale in the United States.</description>
