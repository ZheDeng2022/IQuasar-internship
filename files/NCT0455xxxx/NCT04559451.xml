    <textblock>
      Insufficient future liver remnant (FLR), which may render post-hepatectomy liver failure, is&#xD;
      one of the major obstacles for performing liver resection for patients with liver malignants.&#xD;
      Associating liver partition and portal vein ligation (ALPPS) was introduced to induce rapid&#xD;
      and extensive liver hypertrophy, which offers the opportunity for removing the liver&#xD;
      malignancy in the second stage operation for patients with insufficient FLR at their first&#xD;
      stage operation. Feasibility of the second stage of ALPPS has been assessed mostly on the&#xD;
      basis of laboratory parameters and volumetry by the 3D reconstruction of CT. Meanwhile, part&#xD;
      of the patients who underwent the second stage ALPPS still experienced postoperative liver&#xD;
      failure, even in patients with sufficient FLR volume. In other words, this volumetric&#xD;
      increase may not reflect the increase of liver function. And the laboratory parameters can&#xD;
      only partly reflect the global liver function but not the regional liver function. Therefore,&#xD;
      the combination of volumetric and global liver function tests might be unsuitable for&#xD;
      predicting FLR function after first stage ALPPS because function is distributed unequally&#xD;
      between left and right liver lobe. The Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI, which has remarkable&#xD;
      potential to evaluate regional liver function and could therefore be an ideal diagnostic test&#xD;
      for performing volumetric and functional measurement after the first stage ALPPS in one&#xD;
      examination. Thus we performed this clinical trial in order to evaluate the efficacy of&#xD;
      Gd-EOB-DTPA-enhanced liver MRI in evaluating the FLR liver function after the first stage&#xD;
      ALPPS.&#xD;

      The clinical data and follow up information of the patients who underwent laparoscopic ALPPS&#xD;
      in Department of General Surgery, Peking University Third Hospital were collected. The&#xD;
      indication for the performance of the first and second ALPPS was evaluated by&#xD;
      multi-disciplinary team (MDT). The liver function evaluation indexes of Gd-EOB-DTPA Enhanced&#xD;
      liver MRI such as RE (Relative enhancement of the liver)=（SI20min-SIunenhanced）/ SIunenhanced&#xD;
      and other related indexes were calculated. SI referred to signal intensity. SI20 min referred&#xD;
      to the signal intensity in the hepatocyte phase (20 min after the injection). The&#xD;
      relationship between the indexes and postoperative liver failure as well as other&#xD;
      complications were analyzed.&#xD;
