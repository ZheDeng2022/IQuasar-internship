  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Researchers in this study want to learn more about the effect of a new drug called BAY2327949&#xD;
      on the blood flow through kidneys in adult participants with moderate long lasting kidney&#xD;
      disease. It is thought that, in long lasting kidney disease, blood flow through the kidney&#xD;
      tissue is changed, and that some parts of the kidney may receive less oxygen and nutrients&#xD;
      because of this. BAY2327949 is a new drug under development with a goal to modify how much&#xD;
      blood is flowing through kidneys. It works by binding to and blocking proteins that can&#xD;
      regulate blood flow through the kidneys.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants in this study will receive 3 tablets of BAY2327949 once and 3 tablets of Placebo&#xD;
      once (a placebo looks like a drug but does not have any medicine in it). Both BAY2327949 and&#xD;
      Placebo will be taken orally. And after taking each of them, participants will undergo a&#xD;
      Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanning for 60 to 90 minutes to assess the blood flow to&#xD;
      kidneys. MRI is an examination of parts of the body (in this case the kidney) which provides&#xD;
      images of these regions. Blood samples will be collected from the participants to check the&#xD;
      general health and look at how the study drug is working in the body and how the body affects&#xD;
      the study drug. Participants will visit the hospital or clinic about 4 times in total, and&#xD;
      the observation for each participant will not more than 56 days.&#xD;
