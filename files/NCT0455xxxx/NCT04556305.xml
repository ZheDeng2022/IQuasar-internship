  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Older women with cardiovascular disease (CVD) are at greater risk for memory loss, an&#xD;
      important public health issue due to the negative effects to quality of life and health care&#xD;
      costs. This research will be the first to examine the independent and combined effects of a&#xD;
      lifestyle physical activity intervention and cognitive training on memory performance and&#xD;
      memory-related serum biomarkers in this vulnerable population. The investigators will&#xD;
      incorporate a practical lifestyle approach that can be delivered in the home and community&#xD;
      settings to prevent or delay memory loss in older women with CVD.&#xD;

  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Women experience disproportionately high rates of cognitive dysfunction, especially with&#xD;
      increasing age, compared to men. Some research suggests that older women have a higher&#xD;
      incidence of cognitive dysfunction with greater severity and more rapid decline.Furthermore,&#xD;
      cardiovascular disease (CVD) increases the risk for cognitive dysfunction by 29-66% and&#xD;
      affects 44 million women in the US.&#xD;
&#xD;
      One particularly distressing type of cognitive dysfunction due to CVD is loss of memory.&#xD;
      Memory loss leads to reduced independence, lower quality of life, and higher healthcare&#xD;
      costs. To prevent or delay loss of memory among older women with CVD, there is an urgent need&#xD;
      to develop lifestyle interventions that can be scaled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The long-term goal is to create and implement multi-modal lifestyle interventions&#xD;
      (interventions that have multiple behavioral components) that will prevent or delay memory&#xD;
      loss in older adults. The investigators initially focus on women with CVD due to their high&#xD;
      risk. Physical activity interventions and cognitive training each prevent memory loss in&#xD;
      healthy older adults.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thus, the investigators will evaluate the efficacy of MindMoves, a 24-week multi-modal&#xD;
      intervention, on memory performance and memory-related serum biomarkers. The investigators&#xD;
      will examine the serum biomarkers of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), vascular&#xD;
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), and (c) insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1). Data&#xD;
      collection will occur at baseline, 24 weeks, 48 weeks, and 72 weeks. MindMoves is a&#xD;
      combination of two evidence-based interventions. Mind is the cognitive training program&#xD;
      BrainHQ modified to a lifestyle-focused electronic tablet format. Mind improves memory&#xD;
      performance in healthy older adults and those with heart failure. Move is a modified&#xD;
      lifestyle physical activity intervention from the Women's Lifestyle Physical Activity&#xD;
      Program, which the investigators piloted in women with CVD. The investigators recently tested&#xD;
      the feasibility of MindMoves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Using a 2x2 factorial design, the investigators will recruit 254 older women with CVD from&#xD;
      cardiology clinics and randomize them to one of the following conditions: (1) Mind, (2) Move,&#xD;
      (3) MindMoves, or (4) usual care control. This approach will allow us to evaluate main and&#xD;
      interaction effects of Mind and/or Move on memory performance and memory-related biomarkers&#xD;
      at 24, 48, and 72 weeks post-baseline.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 1 (primary): Determine the independent and combined efficacies of Mind and Move&#xD;
      on memory performance assessed by neurocognitive tests among women ≥ 65 years of age with&#xD;
      CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2 (secondary): Determine the independent and combined efficacies of Mind and&#xD;
      Move on memory-related serum biomarkers (BDNF, VEGF, IGF-1) among women ≥ 65 years of age&#xD;
      with CVD.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 3 (exploratory): Evaluate depressive symptoms and genetic factors as potential&#xD;
      moderators of the association between changes in target behaviors (physical activity and&#xD;
      cognitive activity) and health outcomes (memory performance and relevant serum biomarkers).&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators hypothesize that Mind and Move individually will each yield benefits to&#xD;
      memory. However, it is hypothesized that the combined MindMoves will have a greater impact&#xD;
      than the sum of the individual effects. Findings will provide key knowledge about the ability&#xD;
      of practical multi-modal lifestyle interventions to target memory in older women with CVD.&#xD;

    <description>The Digit Span Forwards and Backwards Test is a performance-based neurocognitive test. The examiner says a string of numbers (digit span). For Digit Span Forwards, participant recites digit span, gradually increasing in length. Test stops when participant fails to recite digit span of same length twice. For Digit Span Backwards, participant recites digit span backwards. There are two separate scores (Digit Span Forwards correct responses, Digit Span Backwards correct responses). Digit Span Forwards scores can range from 0-16, with higher scores indicating higher cognitive performance. Digit Span Backwards Scores range from 0-14, with higher scores indicating higher cognitive performance.</description>
