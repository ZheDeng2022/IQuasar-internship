  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study investigates the major complication rate in cancer patients potentially eligible&#xD;
      for a hospital at home program for management of neutropenic fever. &quot;Hospital at Home&quot; is a&#xD;
      home care program that provides acute, inpatient care in a patient's home in place of a&#xD;
      traditional hospital stay. Learning more about the characteristics of potentially eligible&#xD;
      patients, including reasons for inpatient admission, rates of major complications, and&#xD;
      situations or treatments that would be difficult to deliver in an at home setting may help to&#xD;
      inform future program development.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Estimate the major complication rate among patients potentially eligible for a hospital at&#xD;
      home program for management of neutropenic fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. Describe the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients potentially eligible for&#xD;
      admission to a hospital at home program for management of neutropenic fever.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. Describe situations or treatments experienced by potentially eligible patients admitted&#xD;
      for neutropenic fever that would be difficult to accomplish in a hypothetical hospital at&#xD;
      home program (e.g., blood transfusions, echocardiograms, computed tomography [CT] scans).&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients' medical charts are reviewed.&#xD;
