    <textblock>
      This study is a single centre, randomised, open-label, single-dose, 5-period, 5-treatment,&#xD;
      crossover study in healthy male and female subjects. This study is intended to assess the&#xD;
      relative bioavailability between the fixed dose combination (FDC, i.e. verinurad/allopurinol&#xD;
      FDC capsule 12/300 mg) and free combination formulations of verinurad (i.e. verinurad&#xD;
      prolonged release Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose [HPMC] capsule 12 mg) and allopurinol (i.e.&#xD;
      allopurinol table 300 mg) in fasted and fed conditions. The study will also assess the&#xD;
      relative bioavailability between a formulation only containing verinurad (i.e. verinurad&#xD;
      prolonged release gelatin capsule 12 mg) and the FDC capsule.&#xD;

      The study comprises of:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Screening Period of maximum 28 days;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Five treatment periods during which subjects will be resident from the morning of Day -2&#xD;
           until at least 72 hours after dosing in Treatment Period 5; discharged on the morning of&#xD;
           Day 4 of Treatment Period 5; and&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  A Follow-up Visit 7 to 14 days after the last dosing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each subject will receive 5 single dose treatments of verinurad and allopurinol or verinurad&#xD;
      alone and subject will be involved in the study for 52 to 59 days.&#xD;
