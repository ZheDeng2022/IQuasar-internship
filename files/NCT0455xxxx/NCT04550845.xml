      With this greater certainty regarding prognosis, men with localized prostate cancer are now&#xD;
      equipped with make better treatment planning decisions. This study is designed to investigate&#xD;
      the understanding of prognostic genetic technology and patient-caregiver communication in&#xD;
      African American and rural White men with localized prostate cancer.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Novel genomic technology, such as microarray analyses and next-generation sequencing, have&#xD;
      improved the understanding of prostate cancer biology and prognosis. The National&#xD;
      Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN), in 2016, recommended that patients and clinicians&#xD;
      consider tissue-based genetic tests for localized prostate cancer. However, while much&#xD;
      enthusiasm currently exits for the rapidly increasing field of genomic medicine, the use of&#xD;
      multi-gene mRNA expression panels raises the potential for further divergence in prostate&#xD;
      cancer treatment outcomes by race and low socioeconomic status. We know that health&#xD;
      disparities persist in low income groups despite the existence of evidence-based guidelines&#xD;
      and that adoption of state-of-the-art methods often lag behind in these groups.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The goals of this study are to (1) explore how men with localized prostate cancer and their&#xD;
      caregivers comprehend prognostic genetic technology, and (2) examine how an educational video&#xD;
      about genetics impacts patient-caregiver communication of prognostic genetic technology. The&#xD;
      study rationale is that without direct attention to genomic comprehension, the enthusiasm&#xD;
      that exists in the rapidly increasing field of prostate cancer genomic medicine may not&#xD;
      translate into health benefits for men with localized prostate cancer. The central hypotheses&#xD;
      are (1) men and caregivers with lower levels of education will demonstrate a severe lack of&#xD;
      genomic comprehension of tissue-based genetic tests for localized prostate cancer; and (2)&#xD;
      tailored prostate cancer education, communication coaching, and a genomic literacy&#xD;
      educational video will significantly improve patient-caregiver communication in a low&#xD;
      literacy population.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study approach is innovative because it applies a mixed-methods community-engagement&#xD;
      research framework to explore how African American and rural White men with localized&#xD;
      prostate cancer, comprehend and interpret data generated from genetic technology. The&#xD;
      proposed research is significant because of its potential to improve public health by (1)&#xD;
      improving the understanding of prognostic genetics in minority, low income, and rural&#xD;
      populations, and (2) engage and educate these diverse communities about genomics.&#xD;

    <description>The Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Genetic - Short Form: An 8-item measure to asses adult literacy in genetics will be used. To score, each correctly pronounced word is marked &quot;+&quot;, each incorrectly pronounced word is marked with a check, and each skipped word is marked &quot;_&quot;. Raw scores are generated by calculating the number of correctly pronounced words. Scoring categories: Sum score 0-21 = estimated literacy level less than 4th grade, 22-50 4th through 6th grade, 51-60 7th to 8th grade, and 61-63 high school.</description>

    <description>The 23-item Lewis Mutuality and Interpersonal Sensitivity Scale measures patient caregiver communication about prognostic genetics (i.e, &quot;We spend a lot of time talking about prostate cancer genetics&quot;; and &quot;We approach prostate cancer genetics with the same thoughts and feelings&quot;). A score of 1 to 5 is calculated by summing ratings across all items and dividing by 23. Higher scores indicate more perceived open communication between the patient and caregiver about cancer.</description>

    <description>The Subjective Numeracy Scale is a self-report measure of perceived ability to perform various mathematical tasks and preference for the use of numerical versus prose information. The 8-item scale contains no mathematics questions and has no correct or incorrect answers. Instead, it consists of 4 questions asking respondents to assess their numerical ability in different contexts and 4 questions asking them to state their preferences for the presentation of numerical and probabilistic information.The 8-item scale contains no mathematics questions and has no correct or incorrect answers. Instead, it consists of 4 questions asking respondents to assess their numerical ability in different contexts and 4 questions asking them to state their preferences for the presentation of numerical and probabilistic information. All questions use 6-point Likert-type scales with endpoints as marked. Response values increase left to right (1-6).</description>

    <description>The Prostate Cancer Knowledge Scale s a 12-item self-report measure developed to assess men's knowledge of prostate cancer risk factors, symptoms, prevention, screening, and treatment. Response options were multiple choice or true/false with each question also including an I don't know response option. Scoring was based on the percentage of questions answered correctly and ranged from 0 to 100.</description>

    <description>In specific aim 1, twelve focus group interviews (AA and rural White men with localized prostate cancer and caregivers, N = 50 dyads or N = 100 participants) will be conducted to explore comprehension of prognostic genomics as well as facilitators and barriers to genomic health literacy and to assess the acceptability and value of the revised PCLA education video.</description>

    <description>In specific aim 2, participants will be randomized into intervention versus control group. Twenty focus groups (AA and rural White men with localized prostate cancer and caregivers, N = 80 dyads or N = 160 participants) will be conducted to culturally conceptualize the study intervention and to provide qualitative contextual evaluation. The design for this aim is a randomized controlled, parallel group, repeated measures, non-blinded trial, with a nurse-delivered tailored prostate cancer education, communication coaching, and the prognostic genomics revised Prostate Cancer Literacy Video compared to the prognostic genomics revised Prostate Cancer Literacy Video.</description>

    <description>The nurse-navigated coaching intervention will be based on the Patient Navigation Research Program (PNRP), sponsored by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) Center to Reduce Cancer Health Disparities. The goal of patient navigation is to facilitate timely access to quality cancer care that meets cultural needs and standards of care for all patients. Examples of navigation services includes identifying and scheduling appointments with culturally sensitive providers, addressing health literacy, coordinating care among providers, ensuring coordination of services among medical personnel, and providing other services to overcome access barriers encountered during the cancer care process.</description>
