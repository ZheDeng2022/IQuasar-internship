  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This trial is a prospective, randomized, controlled, clinical trial based on a stroke center.&#xD;
      We randomly assigned 151 patients 41 years of age or older (median, 65 years; range, 41 to&#xD;
      83) with malignant middle cerebral artery infarction to either conservative medical treatment&#xD;
      or hemicraniectomy; assignments were made within 12 to 38 hours after the onset of symptoms.&#xD;
      The primary end point was survival with slight or moderate disability 12 months after&#xD;
      randomization (defined by a score of 0 to 3 on the modified Rankin scale, which ranges from 0&#xD;
      [no symptoms] to 6 [death]). Secondary outcome included death, Barthel Index, National&#xD;
      Institute of Health Stroke Scale, and Stroke Impact Scale 2.0 (SIS) 6 months and 1 year after&#xD;
      randomization. Variables for subgroup analyses were age, sex, presence of aphasia or neglect,&#xD;
      stroke severity and time to randomization. The study was performed according to Consolidated&#xD;
      Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT).&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Patients between 40 to 80 years of age were included within 12 to 38 hours of a malignant&#xD;
      middle cerebral artery infarction defined by the association of 3 criteria: a National&#xD;
      Institutes of Health Stroke Scale score ≥16, including a score ≥1 for item 1a (level of&#xD;
      consciousness); brain computed tomography ischemic signs involving 2/3 of the middle cerebral&#xD;
      artery territory; and a diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) infarct volume &gt;150cm3. The first&#xD;
      patient was enrolled in January 2003 and the last patient in December 2007. An independent&#xD;
      data safety monitoring committee monitored the safety, progress, and ethics of the trial.&#xD;
      Patients were randomized to either surgical plus medical treatment or to conservative medical&#xD;
      treatment alone.&#xD;
