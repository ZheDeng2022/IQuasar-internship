  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Currently, no study has addressed real-life data describing changes in health resource&#xD;
      consumption and related costs attributable to mepolizumab treatment. The aim of the current&#xD;
      study is to fill this knowledge gap by performing an exhaustive extraction of data for&#xD;
      patients receiving mepolizumab in the French single-payer health care system. The change in&#xD;
      real-life health-resource usage and costs observed for these patients would provide the first&#xD;
      evidence that mepolizumab is changing the care landscape for eligible severe asthma patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objectives of this study are: (i) using the SNDS French national database, to&#xD;
      identify a representative, nation-wide population of patients treated with mepolizumab with a&#xD;
      follow-up period of at least 12 months, (ii) to describe the initial one-year changes in&#xD;
      health resource use before and after the initiation of mepolizumab treatment and (iii) to&#xD;
      estimate the change in associated costs for the first year of treatment. These initial data&#xD;
      will additionally serve as a basis for the design of longer-term studies.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Primary objective: To estimate the change in associated costs for the first year of treatment&#xD;

      Secondary objectives:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To describe the initial one-year changes in health resource use before and after the&#xD;
           initiation of mepolizumab treatment&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  To further characterize rates of change in health resource usage and/or costs in&#xD;
           subpopulations of interest (sex, age groups, severe asthma, uncontrolled asthma, COPD,&#xD;
           diabetes)&#xD;
&#xD;
      This retrospective, non-interventional (not involving human subjects) database study will&#xD;
      compare real-life patient health resource consumption before versus after a first injection&#xD;
      of mepolizumab. Data concerning patients receiving mepolizumab will be collated for a&#xD;
      12-month period (the &quot;baseline period&quot;) preceding a first index treatment (at &quot;T0&quot;) and&#xD;
      compared to a 12-month period occurring after the index treatment (the &quot;exposure period&quot;).&#xD;
