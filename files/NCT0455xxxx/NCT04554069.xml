      Assessment of the influence of different antihypertensive drugs on serum uric acid in newly&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Hypertension is the most common condition seen in primary care and leads to myocardial&#xD;
      infarction, stroke, renal failure, and death if not detected early and treated appropriately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Thiazide-type diuretics, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and some of&#xD;
      angiotensin-II receptor blockers (ARB) were reported to reduce renal excretion of urate and&#xD;
      increased serum uric acid levels, Beta-blockers also elevate serum uric acid levels.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Hyperuricemia is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. Hyperuricemia was found to&#xD;
      correlate with hypertension excluding the influence of other factors such as age and renal&#xD;
      function. Furthermore, many studies found that hyperuricemia was independently associated&#xD;
      with cardiovascular events in patients treated with antihypertensive drugs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is important to control serum uric acid levels in hypertensive patients treated with&#xD;
      antihypertensive drugs in order to reduce the risk of gout and cardiovascular events. There&#xD;
      is a gap in knowledge in studies showing the effect of antihypertensive drugs on serum uric&#xD;
      acid in newly diagnosed hypertensive patients.&#xD;
