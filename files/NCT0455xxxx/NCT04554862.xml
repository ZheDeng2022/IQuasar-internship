  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Despite many regional anesthetic techniques have been described for anesthesia of the&#xD;
      brachial plexus which is responsible for the sensory and motor innervation of entire upper&#xD;
      limb, still, supraclavicular block (SCB) is the regional anesthetic technique of choice.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SCB has been described as the spinal anesthesia of the upper limb as it offers dense&#xD;
      anesthesia of the brachial plexus for the surgical procedures below the arm from elbow to&#xD;
      hand. Although the SCB has a high incidence of complications like pneumothorax, the use of&#xD;
      ultrasound-guided block improved the safety for the patient. There are several adjuvants have&#xD;
      been added to SCB aiming for prolongation of the duration of peripheral nerve block as&#xD;
      fentanyl, alpha 2 adrenergic agonist (Dexmedetomidine, Clonidine), tramadol, ketorolac and&#xD;
      Magnesium sulfate.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Magnesium has anti-nociceptive effects in animal and human models, principally related to&#xD;
      blocking the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and regulation of calcium influx into&#xD;
      cells. Calcium influx leads to a sequence of central sensitization such as windup phenomenon&#xD;
      and long term potentiation which are crucial mechanisms that determine the duration and&#xD;
      intensity of post-operative pain. Magnesium prevents central sensitization triggered by&#xD;
      peripheral nociceptive stimulation in response to painful stimuli.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory drugs (NSAID) inhibit synthesis of prostaglandins from&#xD;
      arachnoid acid in phospholipid membranes resulting in decreased afferent nociceptive signals&#xD;
      from the site of surgery. There are a lot of studies supported the analgesic effect when&#xD;
      NSAIDs are concentrated at a peripheral site compared to the systemic administration therapy.&#xD;
      Ketorolac is a parenteral NSAIDs. Studies have shown that ketorolac as an adjuvant to local&#xD;
      anesthetics during peripheral nerve block enhanced duration and quality of analgesia.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Eighty adult patients scheduled for upper limb surgeries from elbow to hand will be enrolled&#xD;
      in the study after obtaining approval of the local institutional ethics committee and local&#xD;
      institutional review board at Fayoum University Hospital. A detailed informed consent will be&#xD;
      signed by the eligible participants before recruitment and randomization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      80 patients will be chosen to receive either Mg (group M, n=40) or ketorolac (group K, n=40)&#xD;
      randomly by a computer-generated table. The randomization sequence will be concealed in&#xD;
      opaque sealed envelopes. The envelopes will be opened by the study investigator just after&#xD;
      recruitments and admission to the operation room. Only participants and care providers will&#xD;
      be blinded to the group allocations. The consolidated standards of reporting trials (CONSORT)&#xD;
      recommendations for reporting randomized, controlled clinical trials will be followed.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient preoperative preparations:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Preoperative investigations will be done according to the local protocol designed to evaluate&#xD;
      the patients. It will include complete blood count, blood sugar level, serum urea and&#xD;
      creatinine, liver function tests, coagulation profile, and ECG.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before surgery, the participants will receive education about the (NRS) from (0-10 mm) (where&#xD;
      0=no pain and 10 = worst comprehensible pain) and the details of the nerve block procedures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After a 6h fasting, the patients will be taken to the operating theatre.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Anesthetic technique:&#xD;
&#xD;
      A (20G) IV catheter will be placed in the UL opposite the surgical site after the arrival of&#xD;
      the patient to the operating room. IV premedication will be administered to all patients&#xD;
      (midazolam 0.02mg/kg and fentanyl 50mcg/dose). Supplemental oxygen (nasal cannula at 2L/min),&#xD;
      and standard ASA monitoring (5-lead ECG, NIBP, and pulse oximetry) will be applied throughout&#xD;
      the procedure.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Block technique&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the ultrasound-guided SCB, the patients will be placed in a supine position and the head&#xD;
      turned slightly to the opposite side of their block. The injured hand will be put on the&#xD;
      patient's abdomen and the shoulder will be moved downward as much as possible. The&#xD;
      supraclavicular area will be cleaned using an antiseptic iodine solution and draped. Once the&#xD;
      skin will be appropriately cleaned and prepared with anti-septic, the high-frequency linear&#xD;
      array transducer will be placed over the supraclavicular area. After infiltration of the site&#xD;
      by a local anesthetic, a sterile 22 gauge, 50 mm echogenic needle under ultrasound guidance&#xD;
      will be inserted and after reaching the tip of the needle near the subclavian artery around&#xD;
      the brachial plexus, the solution will be injected and the spread of the drug will be&#xD;
      visualized. 25 ml of bupivacaine 0.5% + 6ml of magnesium sulfate 10% will be injected to&#xD;
      group M and 25ml of bupivacaine 0.5% + 2ml of ketorolac 30mg + 4ml normal saline will&#xD;
      injected to group K. The continuous aspiration and injection will be taken to avoid&#xD;
      intravascular injection. After performing the block on the patients, hemodynamic parameters&#xD;
      and all complications related to SCB (pneumothorax, hematoma, hypotension, bradycardia, etc.)&#xD;
      will be recorded. After ensuring adequate anesthetic effect of the block, the surgery was&#xD;
      started.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Assessment of sensory and motor blockade:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The extent of motor and sensory blockade will be evaluated by an anesthesiologist who will&#xD;
      not be involved in the SCB 30 minutes. after local anesthetic administration. Using an&#xD;
      alcohol swab, the sensory blockade will be tested by pin prick test using a 3- point scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 0: normal sensation. Grade 1: decreased pain sensation to pinprick. Grade 2: loss of&#xD;
      pain sensation to pinprick in the median, ulnar, radial and musculocutaneous nerve locations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      And it will be tested every 5 minutes for 30 minutes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Motor blockade will be assessed by using (modified bromage) 3-point scale:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Grade 0: Normal motor function. Grade 1: Decreased motor strength with ability to move&#xD;
      fingers only. Grade 2: Complete motor block. And it will be tested every 5 minutes for 30&#xD;
      minutes. When the operation was over, NRS score will be measured at 0, 1, 4, 8, 12, 24 hours.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative care:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients will be transferred to post-anesthetic care unit (PACU) for 2 hours. Then the&#xD;
      patients will be discharged from the PACU.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patient will receive analgesic according to the local institutional protocol as the following&#xD;
      (Diclofenac sodium 75mg and paracetamol 1 gram by intravenous infusion over 30 minute.) as a&#xD;
      component of multimodal anesthesia regimen for postoperative pain control.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Post-operative pain will be rated on (NRS) from 0 (no pain) to 10 (worst imaginable pain) at&#xD;
      1hr at PACU then at 4,8,12 and 24 hours postoperatively.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Patients with NRS&gt;5 will receive morphine sulfate IV at a bolus dose of 2-5 mg increments&#xD;
      with maximum dose of 20 mg at 4hours or 40mg at 24 hours. The morphine titration protocol&#xD;
      will be suspended with Oxygen saturation &lt; 95%; Respiratory rate &lt; 10 / minute; the&#xD;
      development of sedation (Ramsay sedation scale &gt;2); development of acute adverse effects&#xD;
      (allergy, marked itching, excessive vomiting, and hypotension with systolic blood pressure&#xD;
      less than 20% of baseline values); or attaining adequate level of analgesia.&#xD;
