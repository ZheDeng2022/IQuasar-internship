    <textblock>
      The proposed project seeks to demonstrate the engagement of post-exposure dopamine&#xD;
      neurotransmission and downstream acute reorganization of dopaminergic resting-state neural&#xD;
      networks as a means of increasing consolidation of extinction memories formed during analogue&#xD;
      exposure therapy in adult women with PTSD. Participants will include 120 women aged 21-50&#xD;
      with a current diagnosis of PTSD related to physical or sexual assault, English speaking, and&#xD;
      medically healthy. Participants will complete the stages of the study across 2-3 days,&#xD;
      depending on participant need.&#xD;

      Specific Aim 1: Test the degree to which exogeneous manipulations of dopamine&#xD;
      neurotransmission affect exposure therapy learning across multiple indices. Hypothesis:&#xD;
      L-DOPA will decrease measures of fear responding across indices.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Specific Aim 2: Test the degree to which post-exposure functional connectivity within&#xD;
      dopaminergic neural networks mediates the effect of dopaminergic manipulation on fear&#xD;
      responding after exposure therapy. Hypothesis: L-DOPA will predict enhanced post-exposure&#xD;
      dopaminergic functional connectivity, which in turn predicts decrease fear recall.&#xD;

        participate per Principal Investigator's judgment:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Medications which may affect image quality (e.g., water pills)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Nonremovable dental implants, such as braces or upper permanent retainers, as these&#xD;
             will distort the MRI images we collect (note: filings, crowns, and silver or gold&#xD;
             teeth are OK)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Any other condition, medication, or implant that the investigator believes would&#xD;
