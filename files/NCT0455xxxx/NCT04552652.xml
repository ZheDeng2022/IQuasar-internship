  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Telerehabilitation has the potential to become an alternative attitude to outpatient cardiac&#xD;
      rehabilitation. The aim of our study is to research the method of high-intensity interval&#xD;
      training in the home environment using telerehabilitation. Investigators assume that the&#xD;
      high-intensity interval training form of telerehabilitation, using a heart rate monitor as a&#xD;
      tool for backing up training data, can improve physical fitness and lead to higher peak&#xD;
      oxygen uptake as the traditional moderate-intensity continuous training. The study is&#xD;
      designed as a monocentral randomized controlled trial at University Hospital Brno in the&#xD;
      Czech Republic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After the coronary event, eligible patients will be randomly (in 1:1 ratio) separated into&#xD;
      two groups: the experimental high-intensity interval training group and the&#xD;
      moderate-intensity continuous control group. Both groups undergo a 12-week telerehabilitation&#xD;
      training program with a 52-week follow-up period. The primary outcome observed will be the&#xD;
      effect of intervention expressed by changes in peak oxygen uptake values.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The study relates to the previous study project CR-GPS, in which investigators proved the&#xD;
      feasibility of cardiac telerehabilitation. The results showed that aerobic capacity and&#xD;
      quality of life improved similarly in telerehabilitation and outpatient group of&#xD;
      participating patients. During the research, investigators used the moderate-intensity&#xD;
      continuous method. The present research focuses on high-intensity interval training, which&#xD;
      presents comparable or even better results in cardiorespiratory condition effects and&#xD;
      requires less time than a continuous method in patients with low or medium cardiovascular&#xD;
      risk.&#xD;

    <description>Remotely monitored exercises will be performed at home. The high-intensity interval group warms-up for 5 minutes at moderate intensity (65-75% of maximal heart rate). After warm-up exercise, will continue in 4 minutes intervals at high-intensity to reach the target zone (85-95% of maximal heart rate) Each interval will be separated by 3 minutes of active recoveries (at 65-75% of maximal heart rate). The session ends with a 3-minute cool-down phase. Overall training exercise time will be 33 minutes - isocaloric compared to moderate-intensity continous training group. All participants will train using a heart rate monitor during each workout.</description>
