    <textblock>
      This phase I trial investigates the side effects and best dose of nedisertib, and to see how&#xD;
      well it works in combination with radiation therapy in treating patients with newly diagnosed&#xD;
      MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma or gliosarcoma. Radiation therapy uses high energy x-rays to&#xD;
      kill tumor cells and shrink tumors. Nedisertib may further stop the growth of tumor cells by&#xD;
      blocking some of the enzymes needed for cell growth. Chemotherapy drugs, such as&#xD;
      temozolomide, work in different ways to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the&#xD;
      cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by stopping them from spreading. Giving nedisertib&#xD;
      with radiation therapy may work better than radiation therapy alone in treating patients with&#xD;
      glioblastoma or gliosarcoma.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To determine the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) of nedisertib (M3814) in combination with&#xD;
      standard of care radiation dose (60 Gy, 2 Gy/fraction over 6 weeks) in patients with newly&#xD;
      diagnosed MGMT unmethylated glioblastoma (GBM). (Stage I) II. To determine the ability of&#xD;
      M3814 to cross the blood brain barrier and to evaluate their pharmacodynamic properties in&#xD;
      resected tissue. (Stage II)&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY AND EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate the dose limiting toxicities (DLT). (Stage I) (Secondary Objective) II. To&#xD;
      determine the overall response rate (ORR), median progression free survival (mPFS) and median&#xD;
      overall survival (mOS) of M3814 in combination with radiation. (Stage I) (Secondary&#xD;
      Objective) II. To determine the overall response rate (ORR), median progression free survival&#xD;
      (mPFS) and median overall survival (mOS) of M3814 in combination with radiation. (Stage II)&#xD;
      (Exploratory Objective)&#xD;
&#xD;
      CORRELATIVE OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To evaluate pharmacodynamic properties of M3814. II. To assess the alterations in tumor&#xD;
      immune microenvironment as a result of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA)-dependent protein kinase&#xD;
      (DNA-PK) inhibition.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: This is a dose-escalation study of nedisertib. Patients are assigned to 1 of 2&#xD;
      stages.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE I (CONCURRENT): Patients undergo standard of care radiation therapy daily&#xD;
      (Monday-Friday) for 30 fractions. Patients also receive nedisertib orally (PO) on each day of&#xD;
      radiation therapy and given 1-2 hours before each treatment fraction. Treatment continues for&#xD;
      6 weeks in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE I (ADJUVANT): Patients receive temozolomide PO once daily (QD) on days 1-5. Treatment&#xD;
      repeats every 28 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or&#xD;
      unacceptable toxicity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE II (CONCURRENT): Patients receive nedisertib and undergo standard of care radiation&#xD;
      therapy as in Stage I. Within 1-14 days after the completion of radiation therapy, patients&#xD;
      undergo surgical resection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      STAGE II (ADJUVANT): Patients receive temozolomide as in Stage I.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up every 3 months.&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Any other diseases, metabolic dysfunction, physical examination finding, or clinical&#xD;
             laboratory finding giving reasonable suspicion of a disease or condition that&#xD;
             contraindicates the use of M3814 or that may affect the interpretation of the results&#xD;

             ataxia-telangiectasia, etc.)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Active difficulty swallowing, malabsorption or other chronic gastrointestinal disease&#xD;
             or conditions (including pancreas deficiency requiring Creon therapy) that may hamper&#xD;
             compliance and/or absorption of M3814&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Patients may not receive concomitant chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or radiotherapy&#xD;
             (other than as pertained to standard of care for GBM) while patients are on study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Prior treatment with DNA damage response inhibitors (including inhibitors of PARP,&#xD;
             ATR, WEE)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Subjects currently receiving or unable to stop using medications or herbal supplements&#xD;
             known to be potent inhibitors or inducers of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A, CYP2C19, CYP2C9&#xD;
             and/or P glycoprotein (P-gp) (CYP and/P-gp must stop at least 1 week before treatment&#xD;
             with M3814 for inhibitors and 3 weeks before treatment with M3814 for inducers) or&#xD;
             drugs mainly metabolized by CYP3A, CYP2C19, CYP2C9 with a narrow therapeutic index&#xD;
             (must stop at least 1 day prior). In addition concomitant use of H2 blockers of proton&#xD;
             pump inhibitors (PPIs) is prohibited. Patients must stop H2 blockers and PPIs 4 days&#xD;
