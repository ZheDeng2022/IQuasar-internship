  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Socio-communicative impairments are core deficits in individuals with autism spectrum&#xD;
      disorder (ASD). Individuals with ASD have difficulty understanding eye contact, facial&#xD;
      expressions, body language, and different tones of voice when communicating with others. They&#xD;
      can't interpret the thoughts and feelings of others, or predict social events, and the&#xD;
      impaired social skills may lead to rejection of peers and poor participation in school.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Social skills training targets the core symptoms of ASD. Empirical support is building for&#xD;
      cognitive-behavioral intervention approach, social skills training group for verbally fluent,&#xD;
      school-aged children with ASD. Several studies have shown the efficacy of the social story&#xD;
      intervention. It is usually provided individually, but we want to use it in the group.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Many different intervention program have been used throughout the world. One alternative&#xD;
      method used to teach children is the social stories method, which was created by Gray (1993)&#xD;
      to address the social difficulties of children with ASD. The theoretical framework of the&#xD;
      social stories is based on theory of mind (TOM) hypothesis. Difficulties associated with the&#xD;
      impaired TOM was addressed by explaining the complex social concepts in simple words and&#xD;
      often include the description of perspectives of others. Several studies have shown the&#xD;
      efficacy of the social story intervention. It is usually provided individually, but we want&#xD;
      to use it in the group.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In this study, we plan to randomly assign thirty-six 5-7-year-old children with ASD to one of&#xD;
      two kinds of social skills groups: the social skills group or the play activities group&#xD;
      (control condition). Group met for 16 weeks, one time per week, one hour each time.&#xD;
      Participants were recruited between October 2020 and September 2023. Assessment were&#xD;
      conducted at baseline and endpoint (16 weeks). To empower parents, we would also ask parents&#xD;
      of participants to attend our treatment and lecture.&#xD;
