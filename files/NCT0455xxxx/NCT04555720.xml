  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine if an interdisciplinary clinic can help people with&#xD;
      Parkinson's disease care for themselves, improve their ability to follow recommended&#xD;
      treatments, and have fewer problems like falls or visits to the emergency room.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be randomly assigned to receive either care from the interdisciplinary&#xD;
      clinic or standard neurological specialist care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study involves questionnaires both before and 3 months after participation in a one time&#xD;
      interdisciplinary care clinic or standard care depending on which type of care the&#xD;
      participant is randomized to. Participants will be in the study for up to 6 months. The study&#xD;
      will end upon completion of questionnaires about 3 months after treatment with the&#xD;
      interdisciplinary care clinic or standard care.&#xD;
