    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is: a) to assess adverse maternal/fetal outcomes in pregnant women&#xD;
      randomized to receive the 2- dose Ebola vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo [Group A])&#xD;
      and in control women (unvaccinated pregnant women [Group B]); and b) to assess adverse&#xD;
      neonatal/infant outcomes in neonates/infants born to women randomized to receive the 2-dose&#xD;
      Ebola vaccine regimen (Ad26.ZEBOV, MVA-BN-Filo [Group A]) and in neonates/infants born to&#xD;
      control women (unvaccinated during pregnancy [Group B]).&#xD;
