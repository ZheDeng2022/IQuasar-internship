  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      MUMMIEBODIES is a research study when women with eating disorders encounter pregnancy,&#xD;
      childbirth and postpartum. These are some condensed months that represent major challenges&#xD;
      for this group. There are both a scientific and clinical basis for the mother's mental health&#xD;
      to influence care and interaction with the child. In the case of eating disorders, there is&#xD;
      also a risk of harmful consequences for the fetus as well as for more complicated pregnancies&#xD;
      and births. This is a very important field of knowledge, but also a field about which there&#xD;
      is far too little scientific knowledge. There is too little scientific knowledge about how&#xD;
      women with eating disorders physically and mentally relate to their bodies and food during&#xD;
      and after pregnancy. There is a great need for research that promotes expertise in how to&#xD;
      help and meet women with eating disorders in these important phases of life. The aim of the&#xD;
      study is to bring out the users' experiences. The investigators interview face-to-face&#xD;
      pregnant women and mothers with eating disorders about their subjective experiences both&#xD;
      during pregnancy and during childbirth. Recruitment of participants will be via health&#xD;
      stations. The investigators will identify the course, experiences and solutions when women&#xD;
      with eating disorders encounter pregnancy, childbirth and postpartum. The investigators focus&#xD;
      on three themes: 1) experience of course and change, 2) experience of emotional, cognitive&#xD;
      and relational core experiences, and 3) women's own perceptions of what is the best help. The&#xD;
      three themes have in common that they are fundamental for later development of help for this&#xD;
      vulnerable group. The investigators have a clear idea that some of the best preventive work&#xD;
      can be done before life really starts.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The epistemological approach is empirical realism (not constructivist) where the&#xD;
      investigators assume that experiences are real and that the informants is an expert on her&#xD;
      own experience. The strategy is to utilize the informant's experience as a source of&#xD;
      knowledge. The point of view is the informants's, where the investigators try to formulate,&#xD;
      categorize, characterize and analyze dimensions in eating problems in the face of pregnancy&#xD;
      and childbirth as the informants sees it.&#xD;
&#xD;
      There are three reasons for this choice: (1) The woman's experience is an underused source of&#xD;
      knowledge in this area. (2) Therapeutic and indicated preventive measures are dependent on an&#xD;
      alliance with the woman. Alliance formation is normally based on the woman's experience. (3)&#xD;
      The woman's subjective presentation of the course may deviate from what an external observer&#xD;
      would have reported. The measures the women themselves launch may run counter to what&#xD;
      research and experienced clinicians recommend. But objective measures that neglect the user's&#xD;
      own experience are unlikely to have a particularly lasting effect.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The issues require two qualitative research designs. For the first problem, the investigators&#xD;
      will use the method Grounded Theory (25, 26) because the purpose is to model processes.&#xD;
      Grounded Theory is a method for developing concepts and theoretical understandings that are&#xD;
      rooted in data through theoretical sampling, identification of similarities and differences&#xD;
      between categories, open coding and focused coding. The aim is to construct a theoretical&#xD;
      model for characteristic processes, anchored in empirical data from informants in the study.&#xD;
      For the other two issues, the method Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) will be&#xD;
      used. IPA is a qualitative research method that is particularly suitable for psychological&#xD;
      topics (27). The aim of IPA is to analyze and systematize the informants' experience and&#xD;
      understanding of a phenomenon. Through this method, overall meaningful themes can be&#xD;
      identified. At the same time, one can bring out nuances and variation in the material and&#xD;
      look for any dimensions in the experiences.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Informants. The investigators will use a heterogeneous sample. This has several causes. We&#xD;
      currently know too little scientific to identify one scientifically and clinically&#xD;
      interesting homogeneous group. Our clinical experience indicates that there can be great&#xD;
      variation between different women in this life situation. In this round, the investigators&#xD;
      seek to identify different experiences one may have. Varied diagnoses have been chosen&#xD;
      because the investigators want to describe different courses, because these diagnoses are&#xD;
      often unstable, and because the investigators want to identify possible measures with&#xD;
      different experiences and courses. Such diversity has great clinical relevance and has not&#xD;
      been previously described scientifically. In practice, it facilitates the recruitment of&#xD;
      informants. A disadvantage of using a heterogeneous sample is that each individual informant&#xD;
      becomes relatively important. This is a small problem as long as the purpose is to identify&#xD;
      different experiences. The limitation lies in the cases where a supposedly important&#xD;
      experience is described in only one or very few informants and at the same time there is&#xD;
      basically little depth and nuance in the descriptions. This is compensated to some extent by&#xD;
      very high demands on the quality of the way the investigators interview the informants. The&#xD;
      investigators define the group of informants in pregnancy and follow longitudinally with two&#xD;
      measurement times: in pregnancy and after birth.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The number of informants for problem 1 will be determined on the basis of a saturation&#xD;
      criterion where we include informants until after at least ten interviews, three subsequent&#xD;
      interviews follow which do not add anything significantly new to the answer to the problems&#xD;
      (30). Based on previous experience with similar surveys, the number of informants for each&#xD;
      issue is expected to be somewhere around 20 informants, ie about 40 informants. From these, a&#xD;
      strategic choice will be made on issues 2 and 3. Strategic choice can mean looking for&#xD;
      differences in order to obtain different prototype experiences. Recruitment of informants&#xD;
      will take place continuously from the start of the project via a network.The project period&#xD;
      has been extended to four years to get a sufficient number of informants.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before further inclusion in the study, eating disorders are mapped with a revised version of&#xD;
      the Eating Disorders Examination Questionnaire, EDE-Q adapted to pregnant women and women&#xD;
      immediately after birth (16). The form is scored by the research fellow before further&#xD;
      inclusion. EDE-Q is a self-completion form based on the &quot;Eating Disorder Examination&quot; (EDE)&#xD;
      interview. EDE-Q measures the core symptoms of eating disorders. EDE-Q adapted to pregnant&#xD;
      women and women immediately after birth is based on factor analysis. If the informant&#xD;
      satisfies diagnostic criteria for a cut-off equivalent to â‰¥ 2.8 for an eating disorder, we&#xD;
      will conduct a researcher-based interview, Eating Disorder Examination (EDE), for diagnosing&#xD;
      the informant, and obtain standard background information. EDE is designed to assess the&#xD;
      current condition, as well as to generate an operationalized defined eating disorder&#xD;
      diagnosis. The interview is conducted after the experience interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The informants' background will be thoroughly documented. Background information will include&#xD;
      data on age, gender, diagnosis, type of eating disorder, weight before, during and after&#xD;
      pregnancy, onset of illness, first contact with the support system, relationships, first-time&#xD;
      or multiple births. Background information is filled in by interviewer after the experience&#xD;
      interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Information about the issues is collected through a semi-structured, interactive face-to-face&#xD;
      interview. The aim of the interviews is to get descriptions as precise and close to the&#xD;
      participants' own experiences as possible. A semi-structured interview guide is designed in&#xD;
      advance. The Interview Guide is developed in close collaboration with user representatives in&#xD;
      the reference group and ensures that relevant input from the reference group is covered in&#xD;
      the interview. The interview guide contains all the topics we want the interview to cover in&#xD;
      advance. The interview guide is primarily a thematic guide and aims to prepare interviews as&#xD;
      an instrument. It is also used as a summary and checklist for interviews at the end of the&#xD;
      interview to ensure that all relevant topics are touched upon. The informants are thoroughly&#xD;
      informed in advance about what the interview will be about and why, and how it will proceed.&#xD;
      The better informed the informant is in advance, the better founded the voluntary&#xD;
      participation. The actual interview takes the form of improvisation on the topics as it is&#xD;
      natural from the dynamics that develop in the conversation. The informant can introduce their&#xD;
      own relevant topics independently of the interview guide. The supervisors have published a&#xD;
      double-digit number of scientific articles and trained thousands of clinicians and&#xD;
      researchers with this method, which is informally called the &quot;Experience Interview&quot; developed&#xD;
      by Arne Holte (19, 21-23). The interviews are quality assured by a professional who is not&#xD;
      directly involved, continuously listening through randomly selected sections of randomly&#xD;
      selected interviews and providing guiding comments. The purpose of this is to ensure that&#xD;
      consistency and validity in the interview format is maintained.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data analysis. All interviews are transcribed verbatim, stored, organized, coded and analyzed&#xD;
      in the electronic software NVivo version 11. Data for problem 1 will be analyzed according to&#xD;
      the Grounded Theory method (25, 26). The analysis involves eight phases such as categories,&#xD;
      theoretical sampling, identification of similarities and differences between categories, open&#xD;
      coding, focused coding, negative case analysis, theoretical sensitivity, theoretical&#xD;
      sampling, theoretical saturation, memo writing. The analysis will be regularly discussed in&#xD;
      the research group and continuously monitored by the main supervisor to ensure reliability&#xD;
      and credibility. Data for issues 2 and 3 will be analyzed according to the IPA method (27).&#xD;
      Repeated listening and reading of each interview is carried out to get an overview and&#xD;
      context. Each text is then explored using open thematic coding according to the &quot;bottom-up&#xD;
      principle&quot;. Each interview is divided into text excerpts that are given a definition based on&#xD;
      the content of meaning and distributed in a tree structure. The definitions of potential&#xD;
      constructions are finally tested against the text by confirmation and selective coding&#xD;
      according to the &quot;top-down principle&quot;.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Validation of the results will take place through focus group interviews with informants from&#xD;
      the survey with varying stories. The number and selection of focus group participants depends&#xD;
      on the results. The participants will be briefly presented in advance with the most important&#xD;
      results in writing. The results will then be presented orally to the group. The group will be&#xD;
      asked to comment on the presentations. The purpose is to investigate whether the informants&#xD;
      recognize their experiences as they have been analyzed, presented and illustrated, and&#xD;
      possibly adjust and correct this. We make audio recordings of the focus group interview so&#xD;
      that a person who is not directly involved in the project will listen through and check the&#xD;
      conclusions the research fellow makes from the focus group interview.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Procedure. The informants will be asked orally and in writing for consent to participate as&#xD;
      described above: EDE-Q, EDE interview, &quot;Experience interview&quot; with audio recording, summary&#xD;
      check according to interview guide and background information. Based on previous experience,&#xD;
      the experience interview is expected to take 90-120 minutes. Total time spent per informant&#xD;
      is calculated for a total of 140-180 minutes of interview hours (EDE interview, experience&#xD;
      interview and background interview). The text is printed verbatim and stored electronically&#xD;
      in NVivo 11. Audio recordings are deleted immediately after electronic storage. The&#xD;
      electronically stored text is deidentified so that names and other clear characteristics&#xD;
      cannot be recognized. After the data has been analyzed and before the completion of articles,&#xD;
      validation is carried out using focus group methodology. All data is deleted when the survey&#xD;
      is completed in accordance with the agreement with REK.&#xD;
