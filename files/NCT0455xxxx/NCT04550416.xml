  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The objectives of this study are to assess clinical practice variation in prostate cancer&#xD;
      diagnosis and treatment among urologists and how ProMark™ affects clinical practice&#xD;
      decision-making. The study uses a randomized controlled study design of urologists.&#xD;
      Urologists will be randomly assigned to a control and intervention arm.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Pre-intervention/baseline assessment: will be done using prostate cancer CPV® vignettes&#xD;
           and a physician questionnaire to both control and intervention arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Intervention: 2-4 weeks after baseline introduce ProMark™ to the intervention group of&#xD;
           urologists using a protocol to be determined by Metamark and QURE.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Post-intervention: 6 weeks post-intervention, a second round of prostate cancer CPV®&#xD;
           vignettes will be administered to both control and intervention arms. The ProMark™ test&#xD;
           will be available to &quot;order&quot; for all physicians taking the vignettes.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The Clinical Performance and Value Vignettes (CPV®) used in this study simulate a clinical&#xD;
      encounter for a man presenting with prostate cancer. Each urologist will provide responses to&#xD;
      open-ended questions regarding clinical care they would provide for that patient. These&#xD;
      responses are scored in five domains (taking a medical history, performing a physical&#xD;
      examination, ordering appropriate tests, making a diagnosis and prescribing treatment against&#xD;
      explicit evidence and criteria as determined by the literature and medical associations.&#xD;
      Results are presented as percentage correct. Each case will take approximately 15-20 minutes&#xD;
      to complete. All case responses will be completed online and kept confidential.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study hypotheses are:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Clinical practice, specifically decisions around prostate cancer treatment&#xD;
           post-diagnosis, will vary widely among urologists. This variation in practice will&#xD;
           demonstrate the need a new diagnostic, such as ProMark™, would fulfill.&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. ProMark™ will improve clinical decision making of urologists for prostate cancer&#xD;
           patients with a Gleason Score of 3+3=6 and 3+4=7 by improving the diagnosis and/or&#xD;
           treatment CPV® domain score post-intervention versus baseline comparing intervention and&#xD;
           control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators will estimate the effect of ProMark™ on the primary outcomes comparing&#xD;
      treatment and control groups using a difference-in-difference analysis comparing differences&#xD;
      between groups before and after intervention. The investigators will control for potential&#xD;
      confounders, such as age, gender, and other physician and practice characteristics.&#xD;

      Secondary outcome measure include:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. Difference in overall Clinical Performance and Value Vignettes (CPV®) scores&#xD;
           post-intervention versus baseline comparing intervention and control groups&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Difference between intervention and control for use of active surveillance.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Change in utilization of resources in terms of surgery, radiation (in any form),&#xD;
           chemotherapy (in any of its forms) between intervention and control groups.&#xD;
