  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This is a prospective, open-label, multi-center, single-arm study to be conducted at up to 15&#xD;
      investigational sites. The Study plans to enroll 140 subjects with severe emphysema and&#xD;
      collateral ventilation in the target lobe. This protocol is designed to evaluate the utility&#xD;
      of the AeriSeal System to occlude collateral air channels in a target lung lobe with&#xD;
      collateral ventilation (CV) and convert the target lung lobe to having little to no&#xD;
      collateral ventilation. Subjects can then receive Zephyr Valves to achieve atelectasis in the&#xD;
      targeted lobe, once AeriSeal has converted the CV+ lobe to a CV- one. Therefore, the study&#xD;
      will have two Stages:&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Stage 1 will address the closure of the lobar fissure gaps (or collateral air channels) to&#xD;
      block collateral ventilation (CV) with the AeriSeal System; conversion of the CV+ target lobe&#xD;
      to CV-. Conversion of collateral ventilation will be evaluated by Chartis after 45 days. In&#xD;
      the case of unsuccessful conversion, a second treatment of AeriSeal may be attempted,&#xD;
      provided that the total application volume from both the initial and the repeat treatments&#xD;
      does not exceed 40 mL in up to three (3) segments.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical Assessments post-AeriSeal will be conducted at 28 and 45 days after first treatment&#xD;
      and repeated after the second treatment, if applicable. For the purpose of protocol&#xD;
      follow-up, the Day 45 post-AeriSeal final treatment will equal Day 0 for Stage 2.&#xD;
&#xD;
      • Stage 2 will include successfully converted subjects; CV+ to CV- conversion in Stage 1.&#xD;
      Converted CV- target lobes will follow standard of care and receive CE marked Zephyr&#xD;
      Endobronchial valves per the Zephyr IFU to perform bronchoscopic lung volume reduction&#xD;
      (BLVR).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Clinical assessments will be conducted at 45 Days, 3 and 6-months post-Zephyr Valve&#xD;
      procedure.&#xD;

      Severe emphysema subjects will be consented using an Ethics Committee approved Informed&#xD;
      Consent Form (ICF) for baseline evaluations. Subjects with ≥ 50% lobar emphysema destruction&#xD;
      (evaluated quantitatively by using percentage lung volume occupied by low-attenuation&#xD;
      regions/voxels) and identified as potentially having collateral ventilation, with fissure&#xD;
      completeness ≥ 80% from the Quantitative Computed Tomography (QCT) report (CV status later to&#xD;
      be confirmed by Chartis assessment at Visit 2) will undergo additional QCT assessment for the&#xD;
      feasibility of directing AeriSeal to the appropriate segment to seal the anatomical defect.&#xD;
      Subjects in whom this is considered feasible will be enrolled.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Enrolled subjects will undergo a bronchoscopy procedure during which the presence of&#xD;
      collateral ventilation will be confirmed using the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System&#xD;
      (Pulmonx Corporation) and if confirmed, will undergo AeriSeal treatment in the segment(s)&#xD;
      feeding the collateral channel. A minimum 10 mL volume of AeriSeal will be delivered per&#xD;
      segment, with a total delivered volume limit of 40 mL per subject (including re-treatment, if&#xD;
      needed) in a total of three segments. Subjects will be hospitalized for a minimum of two (2)&#xD;
      nights for observation and discharged if stable. Following discharge, subjects will be&#xD;
      contacted daily for at least 7 days via telephone to assess status and solicit any Adverse&#xD;
      Events.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects that have little to no collateral ventilation at the initial bronchoscopy, as&#xD;
      assessed by the Chartis Pulmonary Assessment System, will be exited from the study.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Six (6) weeks following the AeriSeal treatment, subjects will undergo a second bronchoscopy&#xD;
      procedure for assessment of collateral ventilation status of the AeriSeal treated lobe with&#xD;
      Chartis. If the Chartis assessment shows presence of collateral ventilation (CV+) at the&#xD;
      lobar level, Chartis will be used to assess collateral ventilation at the segmental level to&#xD;
      identify the segment with open collaterals. A second treatment with AeriSeal will be&#xD;
      considered, provided the total delivered volume inclusive of the original treatment does not&#xD;
      exceed 40 mL per subject. The post-procedure follow-up assessments for the second treatment&#xD;
      will be repeated as after the initial treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      If the Chartis assessment determines little to no collateral ventilation (CV-) in the&#xD;
      AeriSeal treated lobe, the lobe will be treated with Zephyr Valves as per the standard valve&#xD;
      placement procedure. Subject will be hospitalized for a minimum of three (3) nights&#xD;
      post-valve placement procedure and discharged with follow-up in accordance with this&#xD;
      protocol, which includes standard post-valve placement follow-up.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects who do not convert from CV+ to CV- status will continue to be observed for safety&#xD;
      through 6 months following AeriSeal treatment or re-treatment, whichever is later.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary AeriSeal endpoint is the percentage of study subjects that are successfully&#xD;
      converted from a positive collateral ventilation (CV+) status in the treated lobe to having&#xD;
      little to no collateral ventilation (CV-) in the treated lobe.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Following the procedure for Zephyr Valve placement, subjects will be required to undergo&#xD;
      Pulmonary Rehabilitation as per the local/national guidelines of each participating&#xD;
      institution; at least 20 supervised sessions. A High Resolution Computed Tomography (HRCT)&#xD;
      will be performed at 45-days post-Zephyr Valve procedure to determine Treated Lobe Volume&#xD;
      Reduction (TLVR). Lung function will be assessed by measuring post-bronchodilator FEV1. A&#xD;
      valve adjustment procedure will be considered if there is lack of TLVR (≤ 350 mL reduction&#xD;
      from the pre-valve assessment) following evaluation of the High-resolution computed&#xD;
      tomography (HRCT) to determine which valve needs to be replaced or addition of a new valve at&#xD;
      a previously missed airway. Subjects will also be evaluated at 3-months and 6-months&#xD;
      following Zephyr Valve placement.&#xD;

    <intervention_name>AeriSeal</intervention_name>
    <description>The AeriSeal Foam functions by blocking both small airways and collateral channels causing absorption atelectasis in the treated region of the lung. Occlusion with the foam also yields a targeted fibrotic response which durably reduces lung hyperinflation. The reduction in hyperinflation allows the healthier parts of the lung to re-inflate and improve breathing mechanics and gas exchange. In this study, the AeriSeal delivery will be limited to three segments that contain the collateral channel(s) between lung lobes. A minimum 10 mL volume of AeriSeal will be delivered per segment, with a total delivered volume limit of 40 mL per subject (including re-treatment, if needed) in a total of three segments.</description>
