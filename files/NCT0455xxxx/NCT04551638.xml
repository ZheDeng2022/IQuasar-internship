      New technologies are changing the way of approach for many concepts that used to be quite&#xD;
      established in the past. The Internet, and especially online videogames where people can&#xD;
      create a customizable character to serve as their avatar on a virtual environment, seems to&#xD;
      have a great impact on the way people construe their identity. People may use online gaming&#xD;
      as a means to experience an enhanced version of their self that matches more accurately the&#xD;
      attributes and traits they often relate to their ideal self or even other alternative selves.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project, the researchers aim to study the role that new technologies have on the&#xD;
      way people build their identity nowadays. More specifically, the researchers intend to study&#xD;
      how people use videogame avatars as a means to explore different alternative identities. The&#xD;
      rebelieve that, it is possible for people to manifest entirely different versions of&#xD;
      themselves through their online videogame characters. Sometimes, those alternative identities&#xD;
      may even be a projection of what the player considers to be an ideal version of themselves.&#xD;
      Other variables may increase or hinder that capacity to project the ideal self on a&#xD;
      customizable &quot;virtual self&quot;; some are inherent to the person, such as cognitive complexity,&#xD;
      their current level of psychological distress or their main motivation for playing, while&#xD;
      others may be more related to the specific game they play, such as the degree of immersion&#xD;
      experienced while playing.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers will use the repertory grid technique to explore online videogame players'&#xD;
      personal construct systems and how an ideal version of themselves and their perceived&#xD;
      self-image may help to understand their need to explore alternative identities through their&#xD;
      videogame characters. They will also administrate other instruments to measure people's&#xD;
      experienced immersion when playing the game, the aspects of it that are more appealing to&#xD;
      them, and their degree of subjective psychological distress in order to assess how these&#xD;
      variables, among others extracted from the repertory grid, may affect this identity&#xD;
      exploration.&#xD;

      INTRODUCTION&#xD;
&#xD;
      Since the appearance of online videogames, there has been a growing interest in how people&#xD;
      behave socially on virtual media that grants people the possibility of adopting a whole new&#xD;
      identity as a customized character. A previous study observed a tendency from players to&#xD;
      create their videogame character so that it would resemble more their ideal selves than their&#xD;
      actual ones, and actually reported their virtual avatar as having more desirable personality&#xD;
      traits than their actual self. Additionally, in a more recent study, it was observed that the&#xD;
      level of immersion during gameplay and a high discrepancy between the ideal and actual selves&#xD;
      favored that people created their virtual characters as more similar to their ideal self.&#xD;
      Thus, people who are already satisfied with their actual self may instead tend to create a&#xD;
      virtual self that is entirely different from both their actual and ideal selves. The mere&#xD;
      fact of exploring different identities has been shown to be rewarding by itself, without the&#xD;
      need for the new identities to fulfill any perceived limitations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      However, none of these studies has been conducted using a constructivist framework. Theories&#xD;
      based on that framework, such as the Personal Construct Theory (PCT), provide a tailored&#xD;
      assessment for each individual's perception of the world and themselves instead of&#xD;
      classifying them into pre-established dimensions that may, or may not, belong to their&#xD;
      meaning system. Based on this theory, the Repertory Grid Technique allows the assessment of&#xD;
      the degree to which people perceive themselves as similar or different from other people, and&#xD;
      their representation of what they would like to be (i.e., &quot;ideal self&quot;). Moreover, in the&#xD;
      videogame research field, the PCT also permits to explore gamers' construal of their virtual&#xD;
      self, and whether it resembles more their ideal self, their actual self, or none. From the&#xD;
      repertory grid, other measures can also be extracted that will help on this research, such as&#xD;
      their self-ideal discrepancy, which represents the distance between the actual self and the&#xD;
      ideal self, the presence of cognitive conflicts within participants' construct systems, or&#xD;
      their interpersonal construct differentiation, defined as the tendency of a construct system&#xD;
      to perceive the self and other elements through several dimensions, with different nuances&#xD;
      (an indicator of cognitive complexity). For this project, the researchers will extract two&#xD;
      additional measures as a result of including the virtual self in the participants' grid.&#xD;
      These measures are the self-virtual discrepancy, understood as the distance between the&#xD;
      actual self and the virtual self, and the virtual-ideal discrepancy, which is the distance&#xD;
      between the virtual self and the ideal self. These measures will allow to assess to which&#xD;
      degree the participants' videogame virtual characters are perceived as similar or different&#xD;
      to their actual identity outside the game and to their idea of how they would like to be.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Other factors may affect players' identity exploration by means of their virtual selves.&#xD;
      Therefore, other instruments will be included to measure participants' psychological&#xD;
      distress, as well as more specific ones such as those targeting the level of immersion during&#xD;
      the game and the main motivations that draw them to play.&#xD;
&#xD;
      As mentioned before, there are no empirical data regarding this issue yet. However, from a&#xD;
      theoretical perspective, there can be several configurations of the relationships between&#xD;
      actual, ideal, and virtual selves, leading to four types of online videogame players'&#xD;
      virtual-self construal. The researchers have labeled each type of player according to how&#xD;
      they would construe their virtual-self in relation to their actual and ideal selves.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The first is the projection-type players, referring to those who construe their virtual&#xD;
           identities as close to their ideal self, presumably to experiment with those attributes&#xD;
           they perceive as more desirable. People who see themselves as more distant from their&#xD;
           ideal selves could tend to fall under this category. This could serve as a strategy to&#xD;
           obtain validation in the virtual environment while in the real world they mostly&#xD;
           experience invalidation because their self is far from being ideal.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  The second type, named by the researchers as the exploration-type player. In contrast to&#xD;
           the previous type, these players create virtual avatars that are more distant to both&#xD;
           their actual and ideal selves as a way to explore alternative identities, not&#xD;
           necessarily tied to their need to experience their ideal attributes, but rather for the&#xD;
           enjoyment of exploring a completely different identity. Those players who already&#xD;
           perceive themselves as very close to their ideal selves would be more likely to fall&#xD;
           into this type since they would not feel such a need to experience their ideal self&#xD;
           through a virtual character.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  For the third type, the term proximal-type player was chosen. It encompasses players&#xD;
           whose virtual self resembles their actual self, regardless of its distance from the&#xD;
           ideal self. A way this type of players may be encountered can be either when the level&#xD;
           of immersion during the game experienced was too low for them to feel identified with&#xD;
           their virtual avatar, or in the case, they played the game in a more competitive manner&#xD;
           rather than as an interaction modality with other characters. Another explanation for&#xD;
           why this type of player may not express a different aspect of their self through their&#xD;
           virtual avatar may be because of a low interpersonal construct differentiation, which&#xD;
           would make it harder for them to hold different instances of their identity.&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Lastly, there is the unspecified-type player, including those players whose virtual self&#xD;
           is perceived as nearly equidistant from their actual and ideal selves without those two&#xD;
           being necessarily close. Although mathematically, this may be a possible outcome from&#xD;
           the actual-ideal-virtual self relationships, there is no theoretical premise that would&#xD;
           account for this eventuality. Hence, it should be considered as a rare possibility to be&#xD;
           carefully studied in case its prevalence was significant.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      With this project, the researchers aim to explore how different identities may be explored&#xD;
      thanks to virtual environments and how different factors may affect this identity&#xD;
      exploration. More specifically, they want to assess how different people may create their&#xD;
      virtual self differently and how these differences may be reflected in the previously&#xD;
      predicted typology of players.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With regard to the player experience during the game, the researchers want to investigate&#xD;
      whether the level of perceived immersion may influence a players' construal of their virtual&#xD;
      self. Also, players' motivation for playing online videogames can lead to different&#xD;
      experiences of the virtual self, and thus they want to investigate whether players'&#xD;
      competitive orientation will influence the tendency to explore alternative identities through&#xD;
      their virtual avatars as compared to those who enjoy more the social aspects. On the other&#xD;
      hand, the researchers want to explore players' psychological distress and self-esteem as&#xD;
      factors influencing the way they project their ideal self on their characters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another objective is to explore the role of cognitive conflicts or dilemmas in the&#xD;
      participants' way of representing their self virtually. The researchers expect that a greater&#xD;
      amount of internal conflict could influence the way players explore different identities&#xD;
      through a virtual avatar since cognitive conflict can be a source of dissonance when a person&#xD;
      construes their ideal self.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondarily, the researchers aim to study the role played by other variables on the way these&#xD;
      players conceive their virtual self, such as their interpersonal construct differentiation,&#xD;
      an indicator of cognitive complexity. However, this objective will be studied in a more&#xD;
      exploratory manner, since there is still no theoretical background on the matter.&#xD;
&#xD;
      PROCEDURE&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will be contacted by making an online call on Internet forums, asking players&#xD;
      who may be interested in participating to access an online survey using Qualtrics.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The survey will begin with the informed consent form, previously approved by the ethical&#xD;
      committee. After reading and accepting the informed consent, participants will be presented&#xD;
      with demographical and playing habits questions such as age, sex, country, employment status,&#xD;
      average hours of play per week, whether or not they play professionally, and whether or not&#xD;
      they have a record of severe mental illness or substance misuse. After that, they will answer&#xD;
      the PENS, CORE-OM, and RSE questionnaires. The total duration of the survey will be 12&#xD;
      minutes, approximately.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completing the survey, participants will be asked to indicate a date and hour when they&#xD;
      will be available to appoint a virtual meeting conducted by Discord, one of the most&#xD;
      widespread videoconference software within the gaming community. During this meeting, a&#xD;
      predoctoral researcher will administrate the RGT to the participant, which will last for&#xD;
      between 45 and 90 minutes. Each grid will be analyzed with the GRIDCOR 6.0 software, or with&#xD;
      a more advanced version.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participants will receive no payment for their collaboration, but upon completion of this&#xD;
      project, those who wish it will receive a brief feedback report of their ratings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      For the analysis of the gathered data, the RStudio software will be used. The researchers&#xD;
      will carry out a K-means cluster analysis in which they will specify participants to be&#xD;
      clustered in three groups using their self-virtual and virtual-ideal discrepancies as the&#xD;
      clustering criteria. Once the analysis has rendered the three clusters, the researchers will&#xD;
      label them according to the previously mentioned player typologies. It is expected that there&#xD;
      will be one group where the self-virtual discrepancy will be lower, indicating a proximal&#xD;
      type of players. The researchers also expect that the two remaining clusters will be&#xD;
      differentiated in terms of virtual-ideal discrepancy. Those with a higher discrepancy will be&#xD;
      labeled as exploration-type and those with a lower discrepancy will be labeled as&#xD;
      projection-type. Projection-type participants are also expected to have lower self-esteem&#xD;
      than the other clusters.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A one-way ANOVA will be conducted to assess if there is a significant difference in&#xD;
      self-virtual discrepancy between proximal-type players and the other two groups. Another&#xD;
      one-way ANOVA will be carried out to assess check if there is a statistically significant&#xD;
      difference between projection-type and exploration-type players in terms of self-ideal&#xD;
      discrepancy. Through these analyses, the researchers expect to validate the typology of&#xD;
      online videogame players based on their construal of their virtual-self.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After that, the researchers will carry out a multiple linear regression model, taking the&#xD;
      self-virtual discrepancy as the outcome and using as independent variables the experienced&#xD;
      immersion, taken from the correspondent scale from the PENS and the degree of cognitive&#xD;
      complexity, inferred by means of the cognitive differentiation measure from the grid.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another one-way ANOVA will be conducted to test whether if there are differences between the&#xD;
      three groups in terms of their motivation toward the social or competitive aspects of the&#xD;
      game, which will be inferred through the &quot;relatedness&quot; and &quot;competence&quot; scales from the PENS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Finally, the researchers will carry out a multiple linear regression model within each group&#xD;
      of players, taking the virtual-ideal discrepancy as the outcome for the projection and&#xD;
      exploration types, whereas the outcome for the proximal type will be the self-virtual&#xD;
      discrepancy, and using as predictors the level of cognitive conflict, the level of cognitive&#xD;
      differentiation, and the measures of self-esteem, psychological distress, immersion,&#xD;
      relatedness, and competence.&#xD;
