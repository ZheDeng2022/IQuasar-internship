  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This phase II trial investigates how well trastuzumab deruxtecan works alone or in&#xD;
      combination with anastrozole in treating patients with HER2 low, hormone receptor positive&#xD;
      breast cancer. Trastuzumab deruxtecan is a monoclonal antibody, called trastuzumab, linked to&#xD;
      a chemotherapy drug called deruxtecan. Trastuzumab attaches to HER2 expressed at low levels&#xD;
      on cancer cells in a targeted way and delivers deruxtecan to kill them. Anastrozole works by&#xD;
      decreasing estrogen production and suppressing the growth of tumors that need estrogen to&#xD;
      grow. This study is evaluating how effective trastuzumab deruxtecan is at treating hormone&#xD;
      receptor positive cancer cells that have low levels of HER2 expressed on them when given&#xD;
      alone or in combination with anastrozole.&#xD;

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVE:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To identify treatment arm with strongest signal of efficacy, based on pathologic complete&#xD;
      response (pCR) rate, between two neoadjuvant systemic therapy regimens in participants with&#xD;
      early stage, HER2 low, hormone receptor positive (HR+) breast cancer.&#xD;
&#xD;
      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To assess the safety profile of the two novel neoadjuvant experimental arms. II. To assess&#xD;
      the molecular changes in tumor biomarkers including Ki67 after 1 cycle of targeted therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      III. Pathological Assessment According to Residual Cancer Burden (RCB) Index at surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      IV. To investigate potential serum and tumor predictive biomarkers to predict response to&#xD;
      experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      EXPLORATORY OBJECTIVES:&#xD;
&#xD;
      I. To investigate potential serum and tumor predictive biomarkers to predict response to&#xD;
      experimental therapy.&#xD;
&#xD;
      II. To assess quality of life by evaluating toxicity burden using a quality of life&#xD;
      (QOL)/patient reported outcomes (PRO) questionnaire- the European Organization for Research&#xD;
      and Treatment of Cancer Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Core 30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) instrument.&#xD;
&#xD;
      OUTLINE: Patients are randomized to 1 of 2 arms.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM A: Patients receive trastuzumab deruxtecan intravenously (IV) over 90 minutes on cycle 1&#xD;
      day 1 and 30 minutes on day 1 of each subsequent cycle. Treatment repeats every 21 days for&#xD;
      up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then&#xD;
      undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      ARM B: Patients receive trastuzumab deruxtecan IV over 90 minutes on cycle 1 day 1 and 30&#xD;
      minutes on day 1 of each subsequent cycle and anastrozole orally (PO) once daily (QD) on days&#xD;
      1-21. Treatment repeats every 21 days for up to 6 cycles in the absence of disease&#xD;
      progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients then undergo surgery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 21-28 days.&#xD;

               -  Women are considered of CBP unless: they have had 12 months of natural&#xD;
                  (spontaneous) amenorrhea with an appropriate clinical profile (i.e. age&#xD;
                  appropriate, history of vasomotor symptoms) or have had surgical bilateral&#xD;

                  ligation at least six weeks prior to randomization. In the case of oophorectomy&#xD;
                  alone, only when the reproductive status of the woman has been confirmed by&#xD;
                  follow-up hormone level assessment she is considered not of CBP&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Male and female participants of reproductive/childbearing potential must agree to use&#xD;
             a highly effective form of contraception or avoid intercourse during and upon&#xD;
             completion of the study and for at least 7 months for females and 4 months for males&#xD;
             after the last dose of study drug. Highly effective contraception methods include:&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Total abstinence (when this is in line with the preferred and usual lifestyle of&#xD;
                  the patient). Periodic abstinence (e.g. calendar, ovulation, symptothermal,&#xD;
                  post-ovulation methods) and withdrawal are not acceptable methods of&#xD;
                  contraception&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Female sterilization (have had surgical bilateral oophorectomy with or without&#xD;
                  hysterectomy), total hysterectomy or tubal ligation at least 6 weeks before&#xD;
                  taking trial treatment. In case of oophorectomy alone, only when the reproductive&#xD;

&#xD;
               -  Male partner sterilization (at least 6 months prior to randomization). For female&#xD;
                  patients on the trial the vasectomized male partner should be the sole partner&#xD;
                  for that patient. If vasectomy of the male partner is the highly effective method&#xD;
                  of contraception chosen, the success of the vasectomy should be medically&#xD;
                  confirmed according to local practice&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Male participants must not freeze or donate sperm starting at screening and throughout&#xD;
             the study period, and at least 4 months after the final study drug administration.&#xD;
             Preservation of sperm should be considered prior to enrollment in this study&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Female participants must not donate, or retrieve for their own use, ova from the time&#xD;
             of screening and throughout the study treatment period, and for at least 7 months&#xD;
             after the final study drug administration&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Estradiol level must be in post-menopausal range per local lab interpretation prior to&#xD;
             baseline biopsy&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Postmenopausal status is defined as:&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Patient underwent bilateral oophorectomy, or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Age &gt;= 60 years, or&#xD;
&#xD;
                    -  Age &lt; 60 years and amenorrhea for 12 or more months (in the absence of&#xD;
                       chemotherapy, tamoxifen, toremifene or ovarian suppression) and&#xD;
                       follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and plasma estradiol are in the&#xD;
                       postmenopausal ranges per local normal ranges&#xD;
&#xD;
               -  Note: for women with therapy-induced amenorrhea, serial measurements of FSH&#xD;
                  and/or estradiol per local clinical guidelines are required for determination of&#xD;
                  postmenopausal status. All women who do not meet the criteria for postmenopausal&#xD;
                  status are considered premenopausal for the purpose of this trial&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Pre- or peri-menopausal and amenable to being treated with ovarian function&#xD;
             suppression drugs (goserelin, leuprolide, or triptorelin) per standard of care.&#xD;
             Patients must have started treatment with ovarian function suppression at least 28&#xD;
             days prior to first dose of study treatment&#xD;

&#xD;
          -  Has known human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, or active hepatitis B or C&#xD;
             infection. Patients positive for hepatitis C (HCV) antibody are eligible only if&#xD;

             (such as known human immunodeficiency virus positivity or with known active hepatitis&#xD;
             B or C [for example, hepatitis B surface antigen positive]). Screening is not required&#xD;
             for enrollment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Concurrent treatment with ovarian hormonal replacement therapy. Prior treatment must&#xD;
             be stopped prior to first baseline biopsy&#xD;

             including, but not limited to, any underlying pulmonary disorder (i.e. pulmonary&#xD;
             emboli within three months of the study enrollment, severe asthma, severe chronic&#xD;
             obstructive pulmonary disease [COPD], restrictive lung disease, pleural effusion&#xD;
             etc.), and any autoimmune, connective tissue or inflammatory disorders with pulmonary&#xD;
             involvement (i.e. rheumatoid arthritis, Sjogren's, sarcoidosis etc.), or prior&#xD;
             pneumonectomy&#xD;
