  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Postoperative restrictions are often based on expert opinion and &quot;common sense&quot;. There is a&#xD;
      wide variety in the recommended activity limitation amongst pelvic floor surgeons. Many&#xD;
      patients undergo urogynecologic procedures to improve their quality of life, and these&#xD;
      additional restrictions decrease their quality of life in the short term. Our hypothesis is&#xD;
      that unrestricted activity after a mid-urethral sling will not negatively impact a patient's&#xD;
      recovery or likelihood of surgical success.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Eligible participants will be randomized to no postoperative instructions or traditional&#xD;
      postoperative instructions. Patients will be followed up at 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months&#xD;
      postoperatively. Data will be collected throughout the follow up period, but the primary&#xD;
      endpoint is at 6 months. At the 6 month visit, subjects' activity level, leakage symptoms,&#xD;
      and postoperative satisfaction will be assessed.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      There is a limited body of literature regarding restrictions for gynecologic surgery. Most of&#xD;
      these studies have looked at patients with prolapse and incontinence, and many of the&#xD;
      postoperative recommendations are intended for both classes of procedures. Most surgeons&#xD;
      restrict their patients' activities postoperatively but to varying degrees and for variable&#xD;
      amounts of time. One study in 2017 showed no adverse effect on short term outcomes after&#xD;
      prolapse repair with liberal postoperative restrictions compared to stricter, traditional&#xD;
      restrictions. No studies have been performed to look at postoperative restrictions after&#xD;
      mid-urethral slings.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A common reason for limiting activity is due to the unproven concern about increased&#xD;
      intra-abdominal pressure on healing and surgical success. At this time, no studies have shown&#xD;
      causality. The range of intra-abdominal pressures generated during &quot;unavoidable&quot; activities,&#xD;
      such as coughing, standing, and bending, overlaps with the range of pressures generated&#xD;
      during activities that are typically restricted. Another study showed the intra-abdominal&#xD;
      pressures generated during activities of daily living overlapped with pressures generated by&#xD;
      women performing CrossFit exercises.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A 2017 study showed no effect on outcomes with unrestricted activity after pelvic&#xD;
      reconstructive surgery. Orthopedic literature suggests better outcomes with early&#xD;
      postoperative activity over immobilization. There is a significant body of literature showing&#xD;
      potential detrimental effects of sedentary behavior and bed rest.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2010, an estimated 28.1 million women had urinary incontinence; however only 260,000 sling&#xD;
      surgeries were performed that year. As stress urinary incontinence is primarily thought to&#xD;
      result from a loss of support for the urethra, anatomic repair key to its treatment. Many&#xD;
      women delay any type of treatment for stress urinary incontinence due to lack of awareness or&#xD;
      belief in the myth that stress incontinence is a &quot;normal part of aging&quot;. The arbitrary&#xD;
      activity restrictions serve as yet another obstacle to treatment, especially for women who&#xD;
      work as physical laborers. Since these activity restrictions are rooted in medical dogma and&#xD;
      there is no evidence supporting the necessity of postoperative activity restrictions, this is&#xD;
      a significant, iatrogenic barrier to care for all women with stress urinary incontinence. Our&#xD;
      study could provide objective evidence of the effects of activity on satisfaction and&#xD;
      surgical success after mid-urethral slings.&#xD;
