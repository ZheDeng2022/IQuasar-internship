  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Progressive and metastatic thyroid cancer patients, who no longer respond to radioactive&#xD;
      iodine (RAI), are currently treated with long term tyrosine kinase inhibitors to control&#xD;
      tumor growth. The investigators will study the effect of short term oral anti-cancer drug&#xD;
      combination, called dabrafenib (BRAF inhibitor) and trametinib (MEK inhibitor), in improving&#xD;
      thyroid cancer RAI absorption that can potentially lead to tumor shrinkage response. To&#xD;
      assess for suitability, participant's thyroid cancer tissue taken at the time of surgery will&#xD;
      be tested for DNA changes, such as BRAFV600E, RAS, or MEK mutations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Based on experimental studies, the response to these medications could occur within 1 week of&#xD;
      treatment. So in the study, the investigators will find out whether participant's cancer&#xD;
      would respond to 1 week of treatment with these medications rather than the 1 month duration&#xD;
      of treatment in previous re-differentiation clinical trials. After 1 week of treatment with&#xD;
      dabrafenib and trametinib, iodine absorption I-124 PET-CT scan will predict if the cancer&#xD;
      will respond to RAI. If iodine absorption is insufficient on the scan, treatment with&#xD;
      dabrafenib and trametinib will be continued for a total of 4 weeks. Then iodine absorption&#xD;
      response of participant's cancer will be assessed on I-124 PET-CT scan again. If the iodine&#xD;
      absorption is good at 1 week or 4 weeks, the investigators will treat the participant with&#xD;
      thyroid cancer using RAI.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The 1-week treatment regime can potentially save cost, avoid drug toxicity with prolonged&#xD;
      treatment, and prevent drug resistance that can occur with longer treatment period.&#xD;

    <description>Participants will receive systemic therapy in the form of oral tablet dabrafenib 150mg twice a day &amp; oral tablet trametinib 2mg once a day for 1 or 4 weeks.&#xD;
Pre- &amp; post-systemic therapy assessment of tumor iodine absorption is done using I-124 PET CT scan. Participants are prepared for this scan with intramuscular injection of thyrogen 0.9mg on 2 consequent days, followed by I-124 PET-CT scan over the next 3 days for tumoral lesional dosimetry.&#xD;
Participants are then started on systemic therapy for 1 week, followed by I-124 PET-CT scan. If at least one tumor site can attain adequate dosimetry, RAI (I-131) treatment under thyrogen stimulation will be considered. Systemic therapy will be stopped 3 days after I-131.&#xD;
If after 1 week of systemic therapy, tumors do not reach dosimetry criteria, participants will be continued on systemic therapy for a total of 4 weeks duration, followed by I-124 PET-CT scan. If tumor can attain adequate dosimetry, I-131 treatment will be considered.</description>

&#xD;
               2. No 131-I uptake is present on a 131I scan performed several days after 131-I&#xD;

             despite RAI therapy &gt;6 months before study entry.&#xD;
&#xD;
          8. The disease should be measurable based on RECIST 1.1. Lesions situated in a previously&#xD;

&#xD;
               2. Hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl (Note: The use of transfusion or other intervention to&#xD;
                  achieve hemoglobin ≥ 9.0 g/dl is acceptable).&#xD;

&#xD;
               5. Aspartate aminotransferase (AST) (serum glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase [SGOT])&#xD;
                  / alanine aminotransferase (ALT) (serum glutamate pyruvate transaminase [SGPT]) ≤&#xD;

&#xD;
               7. Prothrombin time (PT) within the normal range for the institution.&#xD;
&#xD;
         10. A female participant is eligible to participate if she is not pregnant, not&#xD;
             breastfeeding, and at least one of the following conditions applies:&#xD;
&#xD;
               1. Not a woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) OR&#xD;
&#xD;

                  period and for at least 4 months after the last dose of dabrafenib and&#xD;
                  trametinib. Contraception has to be continued for 6 months after radioactive&#xD;
                  iodine if this were to be administered. Barrier method of contraception is&#xD;
                  preferred as dabrafenib may decrease serum estrogen and progestin concentrations.&#xD;
&#xD;
             Female patients of childbearing potential are required to have a negative serum&#xD;
             pregnancy test within 14 days prior to the first dose of study medication.&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. A male participant must agree to use a contraception during the treatment period and&#xD;
             for at least 4 months days after the last dose of dabrafenib and trametinib (and&#xD;
             radioactive iodine if administered), and refrain from donating sperm during this&#xD;
             period.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Patients will not be recruited if they meet the following criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;

             within 2 weeks prior to randomisation.&#xD;
&#xD;
          6. Had received prior radiotherapy within 2 weeks of start of study treatment.&#xD;
             Participants must have recovered from all radiation-related toxicities.&#xD;
&#xD;
          7. Patients who have not recovered from adverse events related to prior therapy for&#xD;
             cancer to Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) 4.03 grade 2 or less,&#xD;

             to section 3.7 (concomitant treatment) for list of medications that require closer&#xD;
             monitoring.]&#xD;
&#xD;
         11. Patients with a known history of retinal vein occlusion, central serous retinopathy,&#xD;
             uncontrolled glaucoma or ocular hypertension.&#xD;
&#xD;
         12. Patients with class II, III, or IV heart failure as defined by the New York Heart&#xD;

             subjects with Bundle Branch Block).&#xD;
&#xD;
         14. Patients with uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing&#xD;
             or active infection requiring intravenous antibiotics, symptomatic congestive heart&#xD;
             failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social&#xD;
             situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.&#xD;
&#xD;
         15. Pregnant women and nursing women are excluded from this study because dabrafenib has&#xD;
             the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. In embro-fetal developmental&#xD;
             studies in rats, developmental toxicities including reduced fetal body weight,&#xD;
             embryo-lethality, cardiac ventricular septal defect malformations, delayed skeletal&#xD;
             development and variation in thymic shape have been observed.&#xD;
