      This study is a single blind, randomized controlled trial. condition/disease: acute low-back&#xD;
      pain treatment/intervention: Motion Style Acupuncture Treatment using Traction (T-MSAT)&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Motion Style Acupuncture Treatment(MSAT) is a therapeutic technique using acupuncture needle&#xD;
      created in Jaseng Hospital. T-MSAT(Motion style acupuncture treatment using traction) is a&#xD;
      kind of MSATs, and a treatment that improves musculoskeletal problems by pulling the&#xD;
      patient's body through the device and giving instructions for walking while being&#xD;
      acupuncture.This treatment involves patients with musculoskeletal pain to move the part of&#xD;
      their body actively during acupuncture treatment under physicians' observation. This&#xD;
      treatment is known to relieve pain and improve musculoskeletal disfunctions. However, there&#xD;
      has been no specific studies for the effect of this treatment.&#xD;
&#xD;
      So, investigators conduct a randomized controlled trials to verify the effectiveness and&#xD;
      safety of T-MSAT. From September 2020 to March 2021, investigators recruit 100 inpatients who&#xD;
      are suffered from acute low-back pain with the numeric rating scale(NRS) over 5 by traffic&#xD;
      accident(TA). For experimental group(n=50), investigators conduct T-MSAT three times(on 2nd,&#xD;
      3rd and 4th day of hospitalization) and other Korean medical treatment. For control&#xD;
      group(n=50), just Korean medical treatment except T-MSAT is conducted. For these two groups,&#xD;
      investigators compare NRS(Numeric Rating Scale), Visual Analogue Scale(VAS), Range Of&#xD;
      Motion(ROM), , Oswestry Disability Index(ODI), the 12-Item Short Form Health Survey(SF-12),&#xD;
      and PTSD Checklist for DSM(Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders,&#xD;
      DSM)-5(PCL-5)&#xD;

    <description>The extent of acute low-back pain and discomfort was assessed using NRS. NRS is a pain scale in which the patient indicates their subjective pain as a whole number from 0 to 10. The participants are asked to report their low-back pain and discomfort using NRS, where 0 indicates 'no pain or discomfort' and 10 indicates 'the most severe pain and discomfort imaginable'.</description>
