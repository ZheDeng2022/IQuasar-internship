  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The broad aim of this clinical study is to assess the hypothesis that morphological and&#xD;
      phonological deficits are linked by a broader deficit in sequential pattern learning. This&#xD;
      hypothesis applies to learning in general, but is especially critical as an avenue for&#xD;
      developing earlier assessments and more powerful interventions for children with&#xD;
      developmental language disorder (DLD; also known as specific language impairment). Other&#xD;
      populations, such as at-risk toddlers, may also benefit from this new approach.&#xD;
    </textblock>
  </brief_summary>
  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      The developmental approach taken here combines what is already known about morpho-syntactic&#xD;
      deficits in DLD with recent developments in the fields of linguistics and language&#xD;
      acquisition. First, it is possible to divide phonological and morphological patterns into&#xD;
      three pattern types (Single Feature, OR/Disjunction, Family Resemblance/Prototype), with&#xD;
      these types having a long history of study in visual pattern learning. Importantly, children&#xD;
      with DLD appear to have maximum difficulty with morpho-syntactic patterns of the OR type&#xD;
      (e.g., regular past tense; add a &quot;t&quot; if the final consonant is voiceless OR a &quot;d&quot; if the&#xD;
      final consonant is voiced). In contrast, studies using artificial grammars show that infants&#xD;
      who are typically developing are highly adept at learning Single Feature and OR pattern&#xD;
      types; Family Resemblance patterns may be weaker. Family resemblance patterns relate to&#xD;
      similarity, and may be more closely tied to the lexicon than to grammar (e.g., beagles and&#xD;
      terriers are similar and they are both dogs; the words &quot;goat&quot; and &quot;boat&quot; are similar).&#xD;
      Typical adults are adept at Single Feature and Family Resemblance patterns, but appear to be,&#xD;
      at least superficially, more like children with DLD in their performance on the OR pattern.&#xD;
&#xD;
      With these developmental findings as a starting point, the proposed research links&#xD;
      phonological and morphological sequence learning in children with developmental language&#xD;
      disorder (DLD). In the studies focused on children, the investigators ask if 4- to&#xD;
      6-year-olds who are typically developing as well as those with DLD (both with and without&#xD;
      co-occurring speech sound deficits) and speech sound disorder (SSD; without co-occurring&#xD;
      morpho-syntactic deficits) are sensitive to input examples that fit one of these three&#xD;
      patterns. The hypothesis is that, consistent with their long-documented morpho-syntactic&#xD;
      deficit, children with DLD will have particular difficulty with the OR pattern. Consistent&#xD;
      with their intact morpho-syntactic skills, children with SSD should show no deficits in the&#xD;
      OR pattern, revealing a link between OR pattern learning, phonology, and morpho-syntax. The&#xD;
      endpoint measure is that children with DLD (both with and without an accompanying SSD) do not&#xD;
      show sensitivity to the OR pattern, as measured by sound pattern (e.g., phonetic accuracy,&#xD;
      syllable sequence stability) and motor learning (e.g., articulatory and acoustic variability)&#xD;
      measures.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This hypothesis is assessed by indexing the learning trajectory across the training period&#xD;
      and during generalization to new nonwords that are consistent or inconsistent with the&#xD;
      training pattern. In the generalization phase, children are asked to name new novel words&#xD;
      that are either consistent (i.e., that fit the training rule) or inconsistent (i.e., that do&#xD;
      not fit the training rule) nonwords. It is predicted that children with TD and SSD, who are&#xD;
      still in a period of language learning plasticity (they can still learn the sound patterns&#xD;
      and grammar of a second language) will be sensitive to all three patterns. However, children&#xD;
      with DLD (both with and without accompanying SSD) are predicted to show sensitivity to the&#xD;
      family resemblance and single feature patterns, but not to the critical OR pattern-the one&#xD;
      associated with sound pattern and grammatical learning, This would reveal an important&#xD;
      connection between sound pattern and grammatical learning, which could lead to earlier&#xD;
      diagnosis (phonological patterns emerge earlier than grammar) and to more general&#xD;
      intervention practices that focus on sequential pattern learning rather than specific&#xD;
      language goals may be efficacious.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A second aim explores whether the inclusion of a semantic subcategory cue facilitates&#xD;
      learning the OR pattern. The hypothesis is that children with DLD (as well as typical adults)&#xD;
      who initially are predicted to have the most difficulty with the OR pattern, will show&#xD;
      increases in sensitivity following the addition of a semantic category cue (e.g., animals for&#xD;
      the voiced consonant rule OR tools for the voiceless consonant rule). This result would be&#xD;
      especially important for learners with DLD, as it may provide a pathway for intervention of a&#xD;
      core learning deficit.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Critically, these studies are developmental in nature. In the adult component of this&#xD;
      research (conducted under a separate clinical trial, Gerken, University of Arizona), the&#xD;
      investigators ask if adults are sensitive to input examples that fit one of these three&#xD;
      patterns. The hypothesis, based on previous findings from the Gerken lab, is that adults,&#xD;
      like children with DLD, do not show sensitivity to the OR pattern. However, adults are&#xD;
      sensitive to single feature and Family Resemblance patterns. Adults still learn words readily&#xD;
      and are sensitive to family resemblance prototype relationships. For adults, perceptual&#xD;
      measures index sensitivity. Similar to the children with typical development, DLD and SSD,&#xD;
      the investigators explore whether the inclusion of a semantic subcategory cue facilitates&#xD;
      learning the OR pattern in adults. The hypothesis is that all learners, including adults,&#xD;
      will show increases in sensitivity following the addition of a semantic category cue (e.g.,&#xD;
      animals for voiced rule OR tools for voiceless rule). The findings from adults contribute to&#xD;
      a dynamic developmental framework. Because of the dramatic developmental changes in&#xD;
      sensitivity to phonological sound patterns and the presumed linkage of such patterns to&#xD;
      morpho-syntax, the data from adults are essential in identifying the underlying mechanism(s)&#xD;
      of DLD and to suggesting possible intervention strategies, such as employing semantic cues to&#xD;
      the OR pattern and strengthening lexical organization.&#xD;
&#xD;
      From previous work, it is known that infants are sensitive to the OR rule. In the studies&#xD;
      focused on toddlers (also in a separate clinical trial conducted by Gerken at the University&#xD;
      of Arizona), the investigators ask if dependence on the associatively organized lexicon can&#xD;
      account for the infant-to-adult developmental changes observed for the OR pattern (which is&#xD;
      not associatively organized) and thereby explores the possibility that children with DLD rely&#xD;
      on their lexicons to compensate for their sequential pattern learning deficit. The hypothesis&#xD;
      is that 20-month-old children, who are just entering a period of rapid vocabulary learning,&#xD;
      will show increased sensitivity (based on looking time to words that are consistent vs.&#xD;
      inconsistent within the training set) in the family resemblance condition when a visual&#xD;
      referent (i.e., semantic cue) is added, but decreased sensitivity in the OR condition when a&#xD;
      visual referent is added. These results will also be related to vocabulary size as reported&#xD;
      on the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory, with the prediction that robust&#xD;
      patterns are smaller for children who received referents or who have smaller vocabularies for&#xD;
      the OR pattern and greater for children who received referents or who have larger&#xD;
      vocabularies for the family resemblance pattern. The results from toddlers, who are just&#xD;
      entering a period of rapid vocabulary learning, provide an essential framework for&#xD;
      understanding how different types of phonological patterns apply to lexical and&#xD;
      morpho-syntactic learning.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The results of the proposed studies provide a critical developmental framework for&#xD;
      identifying the underlying mechanism(s) of DLD. These findings will also lead to the&#xD;
      development of intervention strategies, such as strengthening lexical organization, to&#xD;
      support problematic aspects of sequential pattern learning.&#xD;

        Inclusion Criteria:&#xD;
&#xD;
        Because clinical precision is required, 4- to 6-year-olds will complete a large test&#xD;
        battery.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  All children (TD, DLD, DLD + SSD, SSD) will score above 75 on the Nonverbal Scale of&#xD;
             the Kaufman Assessment Battery for Children (KABC-II), which is above the Diagnostic&#xD;
             and Statistical Manual cut-off for intellectual disability, even considering the&#xD;
             standard error of measurement.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hearing will be within normal limits&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Oral structures will be within normal limits (Robbins &amp; Klee, 1987).&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  The Childhood Autism Rating Scale (Schopler et al., 2010) and parent report, will be&#xD;
             used to rule out autism.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Children with DLD will meet standard criteria.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with DLD will score below the cutoff of 87 on the Structured Photographic&#xD;
             Expressive Language Test-P2 (SPELT-P2; Dawson et al., 2005) that has demonstrated high&#xD;
             diagnostic accuracy for DLD.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Children with DLD will perform below 80% in their spontaneous production of finite&#xD;
             verb morphemes.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Performance on a nonword repetition task will also support DLD status. Scores below&#xD;
             70% for total phonemes correct across all nonword lengths are greater than 1 SD below&#xD;
             the mean for typical children.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Speech production skills will be measured via the Goldman-Fristoe Test of&#xD;
             Articulation-3 (GFTA-3; Goldman &amp; Fristoe, 2015) and the inconsistency subtest of the&#xD;
             Diagnostic Evaluation of Articulation and Phonology (DEAP, Dodd, et al., 2006). Many&#xD;
             4- to 6-year-old children with DLD are expected to perform below expected levels on&#xD;
             the GFTA-3; for this study half of the children with DLD will show performance below&#xD;
             expected levels and half above a standard score of 85. Children with SSD will show&#xD;
             impaired performance on the GFTA-3, but typical performance on grammatically weighted&#xD;
             language measures (SPELT-P2 and finite verb morphemes). The DEAP serves as a&#xD;
             standardized measure of segmental inconsistency and will provide a post hoc analysis&#xD;
             that may be related to sequence pattern variability.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Performance on the following measures will serve as covariates and will not be exclusionary&#xD;
        for DLD or SSD:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Peabody Picture Vocabulary Test, 4th ed (Dunn &amp; Dunn, 1997)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Expressive Vocabulary Test, 2nd ed (Williams, 1997)&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Verbal and nonverbal memory span.&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Because of the emphasis on English phonological and morpho-syntactic patterns, all&#xD;
             participants will be monolingual English learners or report dominant exposure to&#xD;
             English from infancy. Exposure to other languages will be documented.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Exclusion Criteria for all participants:&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Hearing impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Intellectual impairment&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Autism&#xD;
&#xD;
          -  Significant motor impairment.&#xD;
&#xD;
        Typical participants will be excluded if they show:&#xD;
