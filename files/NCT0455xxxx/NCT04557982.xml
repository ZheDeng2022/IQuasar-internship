      The aim is to create a Czech version of pain assessment tools in children, the Simplified&#xD;
      Faces Pain Scale (S-FPS) and the Simplified Concrete Ordinal Scale (S-COS), including&#xD;
      methodology for their use in practice, and to establish their validity and reliability in&#xD;
      pre-school children. The S-FPS is composed of three faces representing three different levels&#xD;
      of pain, and the S-COS shows three blocks that symbolize three levels of intensity of pain.&#xD;
      The instrument translation and linguistic validation process will be based on the&#xD;
      International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research guidelines (Wild et al.,&#xD;
      2005). Validity and reliability will be tested by comparing the children´s pain intensity&#xD;
      using the S-FPS and S-COS, which will be completed by the children, and the instrument Face,&#xD;
      Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC), which will be completed independently by the&#xD;
      attending nurse and the researcher. A repeated measures design will be used as all&#xD;
      assessments will be performed prior to a painful procedure (peripheral venepuncture) and will&#xD;
      be repeated twice after the painful procedure, once immediately after the painful procedure&#xD;
      and a second time 5-10 minutes after the painful procedure. A total of 180 children with will&#xD;
      be recruited (aged 3-6 years) from whom complete data will be obtained.&#xD;

      Introduction:&#xD;
&#xD;
      For a long time, there has been a myth that children do not remember pain that they were&#xD;
      subjected to in the past. However, it has been confirmed that children transfer their&#xD;
      negative experience of pain to adulthood. As many studies have shown, information about pain&#xD;
      can be obtained from patient self-report, physical response and/or behavioral manifestations.&#xD;
      Self-report is considered as the gold standard. The major problem is that most preschool-aged&#xD;
      children do not have the necessary cognitive development to use the standard scales.&#xD;
&#xD;
      A group of experts in Canada has developed two new pain scales for this particular age, the&#xD;
      Simplified Faces Pain Scale (S-FPS) and the Simplified Concrete Ordinal Scale (S-COS). The&#xD;
      S-FPS consists of three faces representing three levels of pain intensity, and the S-COS&#xD;
      consists of three blocks that symbolize pain intensity, ranging from mild pain (one block) to&#xD;
      severe pain (three blocks). Their research was based on the assumption that younger children&#xD;
      are able to distinguish only two or three levels of pain intensity.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Aim:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to create a Czech version of pain assessment tools in children, the Simplified&#xD;
      Faces Pain Scale (S-FPS) and the Simplified Concrete Ordinal Scale (S-COS), including&#xD;
      methodology for their use in practice, and to establish their validity and reliability in&#xD;
      pre-school children.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The cognitive ability of the child for the research study will be verified by two control&#xD;
      tasks, presented to each child prior to enrolment:&#xD;
&#xD;
      &quot;Describe the presented toy (a star). Choose the biggest star from these three toys (stars)&#xD;
      of different sizes.&quot;&#xD;
&#xD;
      The tools and procedure:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Children will be asked to evaluate their pain intensity using the S-FPS and the S-COS on&#xD;
      three different occasions linked to a painful procedure (before peripheral venepuncture,&#xD;
      immediately after the peripheral venepuncture and 5-10 minutes after the peripheral&#xD;
      venepuncture).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before the first venepuncture, the researcher will ask the parents what specific word their&#xD;
      child uses to describe pain and then asks the child: &quot;Do you have any pain?,&quot; (the child´s&#xD;
      word used for pain). If the answer is &quot;no&quot;, then the researcher writes &quot;0&quot;. If he/she&#xD;
      responds &quot;yes&quot;, then the child is asked to allocate the perceived pain intensity to the&#xD;
      picture, i.e. a corresponding face using the S-FPS, and a corresponding number of blocks,&#xD;
      using the S-COS.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher and the attending nurse evaluate the pain at each of these time points using&#xD;
      the behavioral scale Face, Legs, Activity, Cry, Consolability (FLACC) (Merkel et al., 2002).&#xD;
      The child, the researcher and the attending nurse will do their assessment independently.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Characteristics of the respondents:&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research group will consist of a total of 180 pre-school children (with complete data on&#xD;
      all items) who will be subjected to a peripheral venepuncture during their visit to a&#xD;
      hospital clinic and who have not received any analgesia prior to the procedure (the&#xD;
      researcher will obtain this information during the interview with the parents).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Data Collection:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Before collecting the data, the researcher will individually explain the whole procedure to&#xD;
      all participants in such a way that they understand it well, especially to children with&#xD;
      regard to their cognitive development. Furthermore, the attending nurse will undergo training&#xD;
      concerning data collection and the entire study, as well.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researcher personally contacts the parents of the child and the child in the waiting room&#xD;
      of the Children's Clinic in a tertiary hospital in the city of Olomouc and informs them of&#xD;
      the research project. If they agree to being enrolled, the child will be screened for&#xD;
      sufficient cognitive development and ability to distinguish three different sizes. This will&#xD;
      be done using three identical toys (different sizes) that will be presented to the child and&#xD;
      the researcher asks him/her to order the toys from the smallest to the largest. The correct&#xD;
      arrangement of toys is the basic criterion for inclusion in the study. The child, the&#xD;
      researcher and the attending nurse (the research assistant) participate in the pain&#xD;
      assessment. Parents will stay with the child during the whole process, but they do not&#xD;
      evaluate the pain. They will be instructed not to provide the child with any verbal or&#xD;
      behavioural cues or engage in any behaviour that would either distract the child or that&#xD;
      would affect the child´s performance during data collection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The research study is divided into 3 phases:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 1: before peripheral venepuncture: The researcher and the attending nurse complete an&#xD;
      observational pain report using the FLACC. The child assesses if he/she has pain. If the&#xD;
      answer is &quot;no&quot;, the researcher writes &quot;0&quot;, if the response is &quot;yes&quot;, the child will evaluate&#xD;
      pain using each self-report tool (S-FPS and S-COS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 2: immediately after peripheral venepuncture: The researcher and nurse complete an&#xD;
      observational pain report using the FLACC. The child assesses if he/she has pain. If the&#xD;
      answer is &quot;no&quot;, the researcher writes &quot;0&quot;, if the response is &quot;yes&quot;, the child will evaluate&#xD;
      pain using each self-report tool (S-FPS and S-COS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Between phase 2 and phase 3, the child is distracted from the procedure. He/she may play with&#xD;
      the parent etc.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Phase 3: 5-10 min. after peripheral venepuncture: The researcher and nurse complete an&#xD;
      observational pain report using the FLACC. The child assesses if he/she has pain. If the&#xD;
      answer is &quot;no&quot;, the researcher writes &quot;0&quot;, if the response is &quot;yes&quot;, the child will evaluate&#xD;
      pain using each self-report tool (S-FPS and S-COS).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Randomization:&#xD;
&#xD;
      Each child evaluates pain using both the S-FPS and S-COS. The order in which these two tools&#xD;
      are presented to the child will be random. Randomization will be done for each child three&#xD;
      times, before phase 1, phase 2 and phase 3. The order is randomly assigned by a computer&#xD;
      program (www.randomizer.org).&#xD;
