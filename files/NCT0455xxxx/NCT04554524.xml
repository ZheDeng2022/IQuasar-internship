      Pembrolizumab is FDA approved and commercially available for treatment of many types of&#xD;
      cancers. It is considered investigational to use chemotherapy combined with pembrolizumab to&#xD;
      treat thymoma or Thymic carcinoma.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Subjects will be evaluated for eligibility during a 28-day screening period. Eligible&#xD;
      subjects will receive 4 cycles carbo-paclitaxel/ nab-paclitaxel combined with pembrolizumab.&#xD;
      Response rate assessed by the site investigators according to the Response Evaluation&#xD;
      Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Up to 40 participants will be enrolled in this study.&#xD;

    <description>Eligible subjects will receive 4 cycles carbo-paclitaxel/ nab-paclitaxel combined with pembrolizumab. Response rate assessed by the site investigators according to the Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid Tumors (RECIST v1.1). After 4 cycles treatment, complete response subjects continue carbo-paclitaxel/ nab-paclitaxel combined with pembrolizumab up to disease progression, some of partial disease and stable disease subjects can receive surgical treatment. And then continue carbo-paclitaxel/ nab-paclitaxel combined with pembrolizumab up to disease progression, other partial disease and stable disease subjects cannot be removed by surgery will continue carbo-paclitaxel/ nab-paclitaxel combined with pembrolizumab for 4 cycles and then pembrolizumab or Normal Saline up to disease progression.</description>
