  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      In this evaluation, 3 different versions of mailers promoting annual mammograms are being&#xD;
      sent to women on the month of their 50th and 64th birthdays. The researchers hypothesize that&#xD;
      the use of behavioral nudges in the mailers should lead to increased uptake in mammogram&#xD;
      screening.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Mammogram screening for women, starting at age 50, can significantly reduce the risk of&#xD;
      complications due to breast cancer. As part of an existing outreach campaign, the health&#xD;
      system mails a postcard and small gift (pink socks) to women on the month of their 50th and&#xD;
      64th birthdays to promote annual mammogram screening.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The researchers are evaluating two new versions of the mailers against a standard mailer to&#xD;
      see which version leads to greater uptake in mammograms. The new mailers have content that&#xD;
      applies behavioral nudge theory - specifically, loss frames and fear appeals - to encourage&#xD;
      taking action. One of the two new versions does not include the small gift, to test whether&#xD;
      its inclusion or exclusion has any effect on mammogram screening.&#xD;
