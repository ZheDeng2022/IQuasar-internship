      1. Title: Study of Biomarkers in Blood and Alveolar Lavage Fluid Samples of Sepsis Patients&#xD;
           Complicated With Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS)&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. Research center: Single-center study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. Design of the research: A prospective and cohort study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. Object of the research: Patients（age≥18 years）those who meet the diagnostic criteria of&#xD;
           sepsis complicated with ARDS and grouped into ARDS group and non-ARDS adults receiving&#xD;
           mechanical ventilation as control.&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. Sample size of the research: Not less than 30 patients in each group.&#xD;
&#xD;
        6. Research approach: After admission to ICU, patients who meet the criteria are divided&#xD;
           into mild group and moderate/severe group according to the severity of ARDS. In&#xD;
           addition, blood and alveolar lavage fluid were collected within 24 hours for&#xD;
           metabonomics analysis, and differential metabolites were screened out to prove the&#xD;
           differentiation ability of differential metabolites between mild and moderate/severe&#xD;
           ARDS patients. Then, MSEA and STITCH analysis were performed, and the relationship&#xD;
           between different metabolites, HO-1 protein, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers&#xD;
           in serum and alveolar lavage fluid were determined. And whether differential metabolites&#xD;
           are associated with 28-day mortality in patients with moderate/severe ARDS.&#xD;
&#xD;
        7. Aim of the research: The metabolomics techniques were used to compare the differences&#xD;
           between sepsis patients with mild ARDS and moderate/severe ARDS. And determine the&#xD;
           relationship between different metabolites, HO-1 protein, oxidative stress and&#xD;
           inflammatory markers, as well as the predictive effect of metabolites on 28-day&#xD;
           mortality in patients.&#xD;
&#xD;
        8. Statistical analysis: Analytical study.&#xD;
&#xD;
        9. The estimated duration of the study：1-2 years.&#xD;

      This study is a single-center, prospective, retrospective study. In this study, the serum&#xD;
      samples and alveolar lavage fluid of patients with sepsis complicated with ARDS were studied&#xD;
      by using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) tandem electrospray four-stage rod&#xD;
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LC-ESI-Q-TOF-MS). Aim to screen out the different&#xD;
      metabolites between patients with mild and moderate/severe sepsis complicated with ARDS. HO-1&#xD;
      protein, oxidative stress and inflammatory markers in serum and alveolar lavage fluid were&#xD;
      measured simultaneously to explore the relationship between HO-1, oxidative inflammatory&#xD;
      markers and metabolic markers. In addition, a biomarker model was established to provide an&#xD;
      important reference for assisting ARDS disease management and predicting the adverse outcome&#xD;
      of patients with sepsis complicated with ARDS.&#xD;

      Blood samples and alveolar lavage fluid were collected from eligible patients within 24 hours&#xD;
      after admission to ICU. The blood samples were collected and then placed in a layer at 4°C&#xD;
      and centrifuged at 3000×g for 10 minutes. Then the sample were transferred to a cleaning tube&#xD;
      and stored in a -80°C refrigerator, waiting for analysis of oxidation and inflammatory&#xD;
      indicators.&#xD;
