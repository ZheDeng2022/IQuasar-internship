    <textblock>
      HIV-CORE 006 is a Phase 1 double-blind placebo-controlled trial, in which the mosaic&#xD;
      immunogens are delivered by a prime-boost regimen of non-replicating simian adenovirus&#xD;
      followed by non-replicating poxvirus MVA. Volunteers will be randomised to receive either the&#xD;
      vaccine regimen or placebo at 2 vaccination visits 4 weeks apart. The vaccine regimen&#xD;
      consists of a single mosaic prime ChAdOx1.tHIVconsv1 (C1) and a dual boost of MVA.tHIVconsv3&#xD;
      (M3) and MVA.tHIVconsv4 (M4) administered simultaneously. The trial will recruit healthy&#xD;
      African adults 18-50 years of age, who are HIV-uninfected and at low risk of HIV infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The trial is designed to enrol 88 healthy men and women, who will be randomised to receive&#xD;
      either the vaccine regimen or placebo in a ratio of 72:16:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Vaccine Arm (ChAdOx1.tHIVconsv1 prime followed by MVA.tHIVconsv3 and MVA.tHIVconsv4&#xD;
           boost at 4 weeks after enrolment); 72 vaccine recipients;&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Placebo Arm; 16 recipients&#xD;
&#xD;
      To maintain blinding, all volunteers will receive two injections with half dose into the&#xD;
      deltoid region of each arm of ChAdOx1.tHIVconsv1 or placebo at enrolment, and two injections&#xD;
      (MVA.tHIVconsv3 or placebo into one deltoid region and MVA.tHIVconsv4 or placebo into the&#xD;
      other) at 4 weeks after enrolment. The primary goal of assessing safety and immunogenicity&#xD;
      will be served by weighting the randomisation toward vaccinees.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Phase 1 clinical trial HIV-CORE (COnserved REgions) 006 is a trial of a new combined vaccine&#xD;
      regimen to determine safety and immunogenicity in healthy adults in Kenya, Uganda and Zambia.&#xD;
      Immune responses may vary between populations and so it is important to confirm that the&#xD;
      vaccines are suitable for the people and environment where they will be deployed for&#xD;
      protection against HIV/AIDS. There are many different strains of HIV-1, and the virus can&#xD;
      change to escape immune responses. This vaccine regimen is designed to work in all parts of&#xD;
      the world.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The aim is to induce effective cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) against HIV-1. These could&#xD;
      complement broadly neutralizing antibodies in prophylaxis and play a central role in cure.&#xD;
      CTL exert their effector functions by killing HIV-1-infected cells and producing soluble&#xD;
      factors, which directly or indirectly counteract the HIV-1 replicative cycle. In future, this&#xD;
      approach could be combined, in human efficacy testing, with other immunogens that stimulate&#xD;
      humoral responses, with the goal of effectively preventing HIV-1 infections.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The central principle of this strategy is to focus T-cell immune responses on the most&#xD;
      conserved regions of the HIV-1 proteome. These regions are common to most variants and, if&#xD;
      mutated, reduce the ability of the virus to grow; these regions are the &quot;Achilles heel&quot; of&#xD;
      HIV-1. Targeting of conserved regions is further enhanced by using 'mosaic' proteins, which&#xD;
      are designed by computer to maximize the match of the vaccine with global HIV-1 variants and&#xD;
      to block common ways the HIV-1 changes to escape the immune response. Vaccines should match&#xD;
      circulating HIV-1 variants as much as possible to stop them efficiently. When T cells attack&#xD;
      conserved parts of HIV-1 proteins (parts that seldom or never change), the disease is better&#xD;
      controlled-this vaccine includes those parts.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The HIV-1-derived mosaic genes are called tHIVconsvX and are delivered by two safe,&#xD;
      non-replicating vaccine vectors derived from chimpanzee adenovirus and poxvirus modified&#xD;
      vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA). Adenoviruses, if able to grow, normally cause respiratory and&#xD;
      gastrointestinal ailments, while the unmodified chimpanzee adenovirus is not known to cause&#xD;
      disease in humans; the engineered vaccine vector called ChAdOx1 is crippled so it cannot&#xD;
      grow. ChAdOx1 and similar experimental vaccines have been shown to be safe in over 1,500&#xD;
      human volunteers. MVA is a poxvirus, which does not replicate in humans. It was used safely&#xD;
      as the smallpox vaccine in over 120,000 people at the end of the smallpox-eradication&#xD;
      campaign and as an experimental vaccine vector against a variety of diseases in many clinical&#xD;
      trials.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Humans and microbiota, which consist of bacteria, fungi, viruses and eukaryotic species, have&#xD;
      co-evolved over millions of years and their coexistence is beneficial to both parties. Human&#xD;
      immune system is constitutively exposed to microbial stimulation and any vaccine design and&#xD;
      responsiveness needs to be considered in the context of host-microbiota interactions.&#xD;
      Manipulation of the microbiota functions and composition through diet, engraftment and/or any&#xD;
      other means may thus become a viable strategy for improving vaccine responsiveness as well as&#xD;
      treating malfunctions of the immune system. The first reports on the influence of gut&#xD;
      microbiota diversity and composition on responses to vaccination have been emerging for some&#xD;
      time. As part of the exploratory endpoints for this trial, the gut microbiome of study&#xD;
      volunteers will be characterised for composition and richness before and after administration&#xD;
      of the study vaccines.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The ChAdOx1-vectored HIV-1 vaccine in this trial will be tested for the first time in humans,&#xD;
      and MVA.tHIVconsv3 and MVA.tHIVconsv4 (M3M4) are currently administered to HIV-positive&#xD;
      individuals in the first-in-human clinical trial in the USA (NCT03844386). However, this is&#xD;
      the first time these C1-M3M4 vaccines will be administered to humans sequentially. In&#xD;
      parallel with HIV-CORE 006, these vaccines will be tested for safety in the United Kingdom,&#xD;
      in a phase I trial HIV-CORE 0052. The tHIVconsvX vaccines have been designed for global use&#xD;
      irrespective of the HIV-1 strain and are therefore very suitable for Africa, where multiple&#xD;
      strains are responsible for the epidemic, mainly from the HIV-1 families A, D and C. The&#xD;
      HIV-CORE 006 trial will take place at four sites in Africa and will enrol healthy adults&#xD;
      between 18 and 50 years of age. It is not yet known whether the vaccine will have a&#xD;
      beneficial effect, no effect, or whether it could cause harm. The health of trial volunteers&#xD;
      will be monitored carefully, and volunteers will receive counselling and support to minimise&#xD;
      HIV-1 infection.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This trial is funded by EDCTP, under the SRIA-2015-1066 grant&#xD;
