  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Advances in information communication technologies (ICT) allow for ICT-assisted health&#xD;
      promotion to become more common. Integrating ICT in health promotion has been suggested to&#xD;
      offer many advantages compared to traditional approaches to promote family well-being.&#xD;
      Research has also shown the positive effects of game-based approaches in enhancing health&#xD;
      promotion interventions, especially with children. We will develop and assess a digital&#xD;
      family game with theme-based mini-games to enhance family communication and well-being.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      With growing emphasis on the development and maintenance of healthy lifestyles, the family&#xD;
      role has increasing importance. A family-based health promotion strategy can be instrumental&#xD;
      in helping disseminate and reinforce knowledge and behaviours on family well-being and better&#xD;
      equip families to protect themselves and promote family well-being amidst the pandemic.&#xD;
&#xD;
      This study aims to use a game-based approach to enhance knowledge and behaviours on family&#xD;
      well-being. We will conduct quantitative and qualitative evaluation. The findings would&#xD;
      provide preliminary evidence of the feasibility and effectiveness of such an approach in a&#xD;
      family-based context. It would also guide the direction for future health education and&#xD;
      awareness trials and related projects and campaigns for health promotion efforts and to help&#xD;
      improve family well-being in the Hong Kong community and elsewhere.&#xD;
