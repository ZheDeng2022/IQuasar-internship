  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a common cause for admission within&#xD;
      the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System.&#xD;
&#xD;
      It is associated with severe impairment of physical and mental health status and carries a&#xD;
      high risk of mortality. Even though significant progress has been made in understanding the&#xD;
      disease process, currently, its management and treatment is limited.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have discovered that a commonly used drug for the treatment of gout can be&#xD;
      repurposed for the treatment of HFrEF.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The objective of this study is the treatment of outpatient Veterans with HFrEF with&#xD;
      probenecid to improve heart and health function. Specifically, the investigators are testing&#xD;
      whether oral probenecid administered orally twice per day for 180 days improves heart&#xD;
      function as measured via ultrasound of the heart (aim 1); improves exercise capacity (aim 2);&#xD;
      and improves self-report heart failure specific health status as measured via questionnaires&#xD;
      (aim 3).&#xD;

    <textblock>
      Heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) is a common cause for admission within&#xD;
      the Veterans Affairs (VA) Health Care System. It is associated with severe impairment of&#xD;
      physical and mental health status and carries a high 5-yr mortality rate of ~75%. Even though&#xD;
      significant progress has been made in understanding its pathophysiology, currently, its&#xD;
      management and treatment is based on therapeutic targeting of a limited number of receptors&#xD;
      and pathways.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators' team and others have made great progress in the last few years by&#xD;
      understanding and harnessing the Transient Potential Receptor superfamily as regulators of&#xD;
      cardiovascular function. Specifically, the investigators' laboratory has explored the role&#xD;
      the vanilloid 2 (TRPV2) subtype plays in regulating calcium handling and contractility. This&#xD;
      work has led researchers to understand that TRPV2 modulates contractility via increasing&#xD;
      calcium cycling in myocytes on a beat-to-beat basis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The investigators have used probenecid, a generic, globally available drug with an extremely&#xD;
      safe profile that has been used for decades as a treatment for gout, as a TRPV2 agonist. The&#xD;
      investigators' work with this drug has demonstrated it to be a potent inotrope without&#xD;
      apoptotic, chronotropic or arrhythmogenic effects in cardiomyocytes in vitro as well as in&#xD;
      vivo murine and porcine models. These findings have been taken to the bedside with a recently&#xD;
      published small phase 2 study of 20 adult patients with HFrEF (the ReProsper HF pilot study)&#xD;
      where the investigators demonstrated a mean improvement in left ventricular systolic and&#xD;
      diastolic function with no adverse effects after only 1 week of treatment. The use of&#xD;
      probenecid in HFrEF was also indirectly supported by a recent retrospective study of&#xD;
      approximately 40,000 patients in the Medicare database that found treatment with probenecid&#xD;
      (not specifically for heart disease) was associated with a 9% decreased risk of HF&#xD;
      hospitalization. These studies strongly argue for the safety and potential efficacy of&#xD;
      probenecid to improve systolic function and the need for a larger study, and of longer&#xD;
      duration that also evaluates functional and health status outcomes in addition to systolic&#xD;
      function.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The overall objective of this study is the treatment of outpatient Veterans with NYHA II-III&#xD;
      heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) with probenecid to improve systolic and&#xD;
      health function. Specifically, the investigators are proposing a three-site double-blinded,&#xD;
      randomized, placebo-controlled, trial that will assess whether oral probenecid administered&#xD;
      at 1 gr. orally twice per day for 180 days in patients with NYHA II-III HFrEF improves&#xD;
      systolic function as measured via ejection fraction with echocardiography (aim 1); improves&#xD;
      functional status as measured by exercise stress testing (aim 2); and improves self-report&#xD;
      heart failure specific health status as measured by Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire&#xD;
      (KCCQ) and overall health status measured by EQ5D (aim 3).&#xD;

    <description>The main primary outcome is echocardiogram-derived EF.

    <description>The investigators will perform a maximal bicycle exercise stress test (BEST) on a cycle ergometer (Ergocard II, Esaote) with 25-W workload increments at 3-minute intervals. to adapt to patients with low functional capacity as previously described and with all the standard precautions.

    <description>The Kansas City Cardiomyopathy Questionnaire (KCCQ) is a 23 item instrument validated in stable and decompensated HF patients with HFpEF and HFrEF. The questionnaire takes 4-6 minutes to complete and reflects disease-specific health status over the prior two weeks.&#xD;
Overall health status (EQ5D) (Appendix) is a well-known generic measure of health status. It has 5 questions that address five dimensions (mobility, self-care, usual activities, pain/discomfort, anxiety or depression) with five levels ranging from 'no problems' to 'extreme problems' each</description>
