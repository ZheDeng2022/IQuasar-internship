  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine whether a bundled best practices oral health&#xD;
      intervention utilizing motivational interviewing versus a didactic maternal and child healthy&#xD;
      lifestyle intervention will reduce childrens' decayed, missing and/or filled primary tooth&#xD;
      surfaces (dmfs) measured over a 2-3 year period.&#xD;

  <detailed_description>
    <textblock>
      Early Childhood Caries (ECC) is the most common chronic disease among children. American&#xD;
      Indian (AI) children are 4 times more likely to have untreated dental decay than white&#xD;
      children. This is a four year parallel group randomized clinical trial evaluating the impact&#xD;
      of a bundled best practices oral health intervention on early childhood caries in American&#xD;
      Indian children as indicated by the number of decayed, missing and/or filled primary tooth&#xD;
      surfaces (dmfs). The intervention is delivered during pregnancy and through child age 24-36&#xD;
      months. The bundled best practices include motivational interviewing with mothers and&#xD;
      fluoride varnish applied to the child's teeth. The oral health intervention also includes&#xD;
      Tribe-specific individual, social and health needs identified in an earlier formative&#xD;
      assessment. The oral health intervention group (n=175 mother-child dyads) will be compared to&#xD;
      a group (n=175 mother-child dyads) receiving a standard prenatal/postnatal healthy lifestyle&#xD;
      intervention. This comparison Healthy Lifestyle intervention is designed to improve&#xD;
      maternal/child health knowledge and also includes Tribe-specific individual, social and&#xD;
      health needs identified in an earlier formative assessment. Children in both groups receive&#xD;
      some fluoride varnish. All study treatments will be delivered by Community Health&#xD;
      Representatives from two Tribal communities in the Western U.S. Children and caregivers will&#xD;
      be followed until up to 3 years of age. The primary outcome measure is the average number of&#xD;
      decayed, missing and/or filled primary tooth surfaces (dmfs) at the last follow up (24 months&#xD;
      for the late enrollment cohort; 30-36 months of age for the early enrollment cohort).&#xD;
      Secondary outcomes include 1) the average number of decayed, missing and/or filled primary&#xD;
      teeth (dmft) at the last follow up; survey based measures of 2) oral health knowledge; 3)&#xD;
      oral health behavior; 4) attitudes towards oral health care; and 5) knowledge of maternal&#xD;
      health and child development (e.g., pregnancy related nutrition; breastfeeding; prenatal&#xD;
      health).&#xD;

    <time_frame>The outcome will be assessed through study completion, child ages 30-36 months for early cohort; 24 months for late cohort. Differential follow up is planned but only the last assessment time point is the primary outcome measure.</time_frame>
    <description>For dmfs, there are five surfaces counted on the posterior teeth: facial, lingual, mesial, distal, and occlusal. There are four surfaces counted on anterior teeth: facial, lingual, mesial, and distal. The total tooth count is 20 (8 posterior and 12 anterior) equaling a total of 88 surfaces possible. Each tooth surface will be scored using one of the following mutually exclusive categories; cavitated decayed lesion; filled surface (amalgam); filled surface (non-amalgam); sealed surface; unerupted surface; unable to score. The primary outcome measure is the count of all surfaces scored as cavitated decayed lesion/filled surface/missing due to caries for each individual.</description>

    <time_frame>The outcome will be assessed through study completion, child ages 30-36 months for early cohort; 24 months for late cohort. Differential follow up is planned but only the last assessment time point is the secondary outcome measure.</time_frame>
    <description>This is a count of the number of teeth with one or more decayed, missing or filled surfaces. This is calculated by counting teeth, rather than tooth surfaces, using the primary outcome assessment (dmfs). If no teeth have been filled or are missing due to disease this outcome is called dt rather than dmft.</description>

    <measure>Oral health knowledge of mothers/caregivers</measure>
    <time_frame>Oral health knowledge among mothers/caregivers is assessed at Visits 1 (4-7 months pregnant), 4 (child age 12 months) and 6 (child age 24 months).</time_frame>
    <description>Percentage of correct responses to 18 knowledge questions based upon the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire. There are six true/false questions, 8 Likert-type judgements of whether certain behaviors are good for a child's teeth, and 4 multiple choice questions regarding infant/child oral health care.</description>

    <description>Percentage of correct responses to 12 questions regarding oral health behavior. Eleven are based upon the Basic Research Factors Questionnaire (Wilson et al. Pediatr Dent 2016;38:47-54) and one is based on study-specific question formative assessments. Items include three questions regarding dental health care utilization, seven questions regarding parental involvement in oral health care for self and child and two questions regarding consumption of sweets/sugar.</description>
