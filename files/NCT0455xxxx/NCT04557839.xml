    <textblock>
      The aim of this study was to find out the role of balance training on vestibular function and&#xD;
      proprioception feedback in stroke patients. It was a randomized control trial and was&#xD;
      conducted in civil hospital Gujranwala. Current study was completed within the time duration&#xD;
      of 6 month. Sample size of twenty four patient consists of both male and female aged between&#xD;
      50 years to 75 years. Each group contain 12 patient .Group A was experimental group which&#xD;
      received balance exercise in two phases and group B (n=12) was control group received&#xD;
      conventional therapy. Each of exercise program begun with 10 mints warm up consisting of&#xD;
      walking ad light stretching of hip flexor. The balance training group received the balance&#xD;
      training exercise twice a week for 6 week each session comprise of 60 minutes. Each set&#xD;
      consisted of 4 periods of 11 exercises and rest of 40 seconds. Many exercises over time was&#xD;
      turned into circuit training. Data was analyzed by using SPSS version 23.&#xD;

      Stroke is a global health-care problem that is common, serious, and disabling in most&#xD;
      countries, the 2nd or 3rd most common cause of death and one of the main causes of acquired&#xD;
      adult disability. Patients with stroke have number of impairments but usually present with&#xD;
      difficulty maintaining balance. Balance is described as the ability to maintain equilibrium&#xD;
      in a gravitational field by keeping or returning the center of body mass over its base of&#xD;
      support. Body balance is the result of a harmonious interaction between the afferents from&#xD;
      sensory systems (vestibular, proprioceptive and visual). The somatosensory system organizes&#xD;
      proprioceptive information, while the visual system provides information about the position&#xD;
      of the body in relation to the external environment. When the functions of the sensory triad&#xD;
      are disrupted, unpleasant sensations occur, e.g. dizziness, nausea, feeling of imbalance and,&#xD;
      sometimes, nystagmus, Balance is a complex process in which the maintenance of a position is&#xD;
      regulated by postural adjustments to voluntary activity and in response to external&#xD;
      perturbation. Impairments of postural control result in increased rates of unintentional&#xD;
      falls. In fact, falls are the leading cause of injuries and subsequent deaths among people 65&#xD;
      years and older, and generate a fundamental financial burden to the healthcare system.Stroke&#xD;
      survivors present with deficits in different systems, including sensory, musculoskeletal,&#xD;
      perceptual, and cognitive, which decrease postural stability. The lack of postural stability&#xD;
      can lead to falls during hospitalization, both in the acute care and rehabilitation stages,&#xD;
      and after discharge. Because of the importance of postural instability in this population, a&#xD;
      systematic evaluation of balance is needed to identify specific problems.The measures most&#xD;
      commonly used with stroke patients are different parameters extracted from the center of&#xD;
      pressure (COP) and weight distribution of the vertical reaction force. After a stroke,&#xD;
      patients have demonstrated a significant increase in sway and weight-bearing asymmetry. The&#xD;
      relearning of postural control through external visual and auditory biofeedback is believed&#xD;
      to be an effective therapy for improving balance control. In a Cochrane review, the results&#xD;
      of seven randomized clinical trials and indicated that providing feedback from a force&#xD;
      platform resulted in improved stance symmetry after stroke but did not improve balance during&#xD;
      active functional activities, nor did it improve overall independence. A study conducted on&#xD;
      elderly population was concluded that Balance training reduced elderly subjects' overactive&#xD;
      proprioceptive feedback and enhanced vestibular orientation Previous studies only assess the&#xD;
      effect of balance training on elderly population or stroke population. But the role of these&#xD;
      trainings on vestibular and proprioception function were not assessed among stoke population&#xD;
      while in the current study we aimed to assess the effect of balance training of simple&#xD;
      physical therapy exercises on sensory channel (vestibular function, proprioception feedback&#xD;
      mainly). In 2011 on Stroke rehabilitation was concluded by Ongoing trials of repetitive task&#xD;
      training, early mobilization, treadmill training, physical fitness training, and speech and&#xD;
      language training for aphasia and dysarthria are high-quality, multicenter, multidisciplinary&#xD;
      studies of complex interventions, which meet many of the above recommendations.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2004 a comparative study to compare clinical and biomechanical measures of balance in&#xD;
      elderly stroke patients with those of healthy elderly people. This study concluded as&#xD;
      postural stability in quiet stance, as measured by COP-COM amplitude, was related to&#xD;
      functional measures of balance as well as physiologic factors relating to balance, such as&#xD;
      visual conditions, lower-extremity peripheral sensibility, motor recovery, and simple&#xD;
      reaction time Another study on dynamic balance ability through stair gait training where in&#xD;
      proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation (PNF) was applied and for the four weeks of the&#xD;
      experiment, each group received training three times per week, for 30 min each time. Berg&#xD;
      Balance Scale (BBS) values were measured and a time up and go (TUG) test and a functional&#xD;
      reach test (FRT) were performed for a comparison before and after the experiment which is&#xD;
      concluded that gait training group to which PNF was applied saw improvements in their balance&#xD;
      ability, and a good result is expected when neurological disease patients receive stair gait&#xD;
      training applying PNF.(10) A systematic review evaluated recent evidence related to the&#xD;
      effect of balance training on balance performance among individuals post stroke across the&#xD;
      continuum of recovery. On the basis of this evidence, we also provide recommendations for&#xD;
      exercise prescription in such programs. Review evaluated recent evidence related to the&#xD;
      effect of balance training on balance performance among individuals post stroke across the&#xD;
      continuum of recovery. On the basis of this evidence, we also provide recommendations for&#xD;
      exercise prescription in such programs.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2o18 on to investigate the effect of customized vestibular rehabilitation training on gait&#xD;
      stability of patients with sub-acute stroke. An instrumented 10- Meter Walk Test together&#xD;
      with traditional clinical scales were used to assess VR effects. Which is concluded by VR&#xD;
      could be included into a rehabilitation program for patients with stroke for improving their&#xD;
      gait and dynamic balance acting on their vestibular system as facilitator of recovery.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Another study in 2014 virtual reality (VR) proprioception rehabilitation system was developed&#xD;
      for stroke patients to use proprioception feedback in upper limb rehabilitation by blocking&#xD;
      visual feedback. To evaluate its therapeutic effect, 10 stroke patients (onset &gt; 3 month)&#xD;
      trained proprioception feedback rehabilitation for one week and visual feedback&#xD;
      rehabilitation for another week in random order. Proprioception functions were checked&#xD;
      before, a week after, and at the end of training.it was concluded that effectiveness and&#xD;
      possible use of the VR to recover the proprioception of stroke patients In 2020 A pilot study&#xD;
      to find out the effects of COP (center of pressure) movement tracking training conducted&#xD;
      using the Biodex Balance System SD in static and dynamic modes on balance ability in stroke&#xD;
      patients. The result of study concluded that COP movement tracking training in dynamic mode&#xD;
      was found to be a more effective intervention for improving the static balancing abilities of&#xD;
      stroke patients than training in static mode.&#xD;
&#xD;
      In 2000 A comparative study was done by walker et al to compared the relative effectiveness&#xD;
      of visual feedback training of center-of-gravity (COG) positioning with conventional physical&#xD;
      therapy following acute stroke result show that Visual feedback or conventional balance&#xD;
      training in addition to regular therapy affords no added benefit when offered in the early&#xD;
      stages of rehabilitation following stroke&#xD;
