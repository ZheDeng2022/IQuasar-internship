  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      Few studies are specifically designed to address health concerns that are already relevant&#xD;
      during pregnancy. The consequence is a lack of evidence on best clinical practice. This&#xD;
      includes mothers and their babies when pregnancy is complicated by an abnormally slow heart&#xD;
      rate due to maternal antibody-mediated heart disease in the unborn baby (fetus). Since the&#xD;
      late seventies, it has been possible to detect and monitor fetal disease by ultrasound images&#xD;
      and to treat selected conditions with pharmaceuticals administered via the mother. To this&#xD;
      day, physicians need to make decisions about the management of such pregnancies without&#xD;
      evidence from prospective clinical trials on drug efficacy and safety. The SLOW HEART&#xD;
      REGISTRY is a multi-centered prospective observational study that will address the knowledge&#xD;
      gap to guide future management of high-degree immune-mediated heart block to the best of&#xD;
      care. The study seeks to establish an international database of the management and outcome of&#xD;
      affected fetuses, to be used to publish information on the results of currently available&#xD;
      prenatal care and to evaluate the need for additional research.&#xD;

    <textblock>
      The SLOW HEART REGISTRY is a multi-centered prospective observational study of fetuses&#xD;
      diagnosed with high-degree immune-mediated atrio-ventricular heart block (AVB). The study&#xD;
      seeks to establish an international database of the management and outcome of affected&#xD;
      fetuses, to be used to publish information on the results of currently available prenatal&#xD;
      care and to evaluate the need for additional research.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The study aims are to document the outcome of patients diagnosed prenatally with&#xD;
      immune-mediated 2nd or 3rd degree AVB irrespective of the primary choice of prenatal care.&#xD;
&#xD;
      The primary objective will be to determine the rate of transplant-free survival to 1 year of&#xD;
      life of fetuses with AVB based on the prenatal management decision:&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 1: Fetuses not treated with fluorinated glucocorticoids&#xD;
&#xD;
        -  Cohort 2: Fetuses treated with fluorinated glucocorticoids from the time of&#xD;
           immune-mediated AVB diagnosis.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Secondary objectives will be to determine:&#xD;
&#xD;
        1. the evolution of clinical findings from AVB diagnosis to birth (AV conduction; fetal&#xD;
           heart rate; other NL manifestations; fetal growth; effusions/hydrops) between cohorts;&#xD;
&#xD;
        2. the need of new/additional treatment (steroids; beta-mimetics; IVIG) to birth;&#xD;
&#xD;
        3. gestational age and weight at birth;&#xD;
&#xD;
        4. postnatal management (pacing; steroids; IVIG); and&#xD;
&#xD;
        5. clinical evolution from birth to 1-3 years of life (cardiac function; developmental&#xD;
           milestones; infant growth; health).&#xD;
&#xD;
      Prevalence of relevant fetal-maternal events and complications (death; IUGR; morbidity)&#xD;
      between the study cohorts will also be determined.&#xD;
&#xD;
      All management is decided by the treating center and physicians in accordance to&#xD;
      institutional guidelines and clinical findings. Patient enrollment in the SLOW HEART REGISTRY&#xD;
      is possible within up to 8 days of the initial management decision.&#xD;
&#xD;
      Participation in this prospective observational cohort study requires site REB approval and&#xD;
      an executed legal contract with the primary investigator/SickKids Hospital, Toronto.&#xD;
